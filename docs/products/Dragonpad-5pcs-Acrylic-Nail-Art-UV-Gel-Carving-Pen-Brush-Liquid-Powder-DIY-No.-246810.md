<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My daughter loves them she has become very creative with her nails.</li>
    <li> Works great and great price. Went to Sally&#x27;s and the exact same brushes were $18.</li>
    <li> fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Horrible brushes.</li>
    <li> Cheap not good brushes. Not worth it smaller in person than what they appear to be online.</li>
    <li> Loved this brushes and they come in different sizes depending in what you want to use them in. I loved them and will buy again from this seller!</li>
    <li> After reading all the negative reviews for this product I still decided to order it. Package took about 2 and a half weeks to arrive from Hong Kong (came before the 1 month delivery date) and i was pleased to see that all brushes came intact and not broken. When received i tried pulling them apart to see if product would brake easily but it did not. You get what you pay for does not feel cheap and gets the job done. They were better and cuter than expected and I am 100% happy with my purchase.Hope this review helps anyone thinking about purchasing this item for the first time  :)</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. and as long as someone was to takes the time to clean them properly then they will always love them. The Brushes can last longer than u think. Also if u don&#x27;t know how to clean them properly without damaging them then buy a extra set 1 to practice on LOL, I love these nails they r perfect for any job I have to do!</li>
    <li> Loved this, but if used to much the hair in the brush gets damage</li>
    <li> i havnt&#x27; used these yet, but from the look of them they are made well and should accomplish what i need them to do!</li>
    <li> Shipping took awhile I actually totally forgot I ordered these when they finally showed up I was thinking &amp;#34;what&#x27;s in this package&amp;#34; and then I realized what it was, these are much cheaper than the ones at Sally&#x27;s, I have a few from Sally&#x27;s because I needed something in the meantime to apply my builder gel (I use Gelish builder gel with these brushes and have had no problems) builder gel does not typically include a brush, and I didn&#x27;t really like the other set I bought off amazon through a different seller. These are worth the wait and they were comparable to what I purchased at Sally&#x27;s but I can get a whole set for the price of a single #6 gel brush- plus then you have other sizes which I find occasionally you want a different size. Just make sure you have a dappen dish or I use a shot glass that I dedicated to only using for nail art, or another small repurposed glass container, and some nail brush cleaner, and some paper towel to blot them off on, they will clean up easily for future use.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, very good price, I love, is as I saw it on the internet. I arrive at his time, very good, I recommend the product. Excellent product, beautiful color, good material, it received in due time, very good price. I am delighted with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Tested out one today and works well and good sturdy bristles.. And for the price you cant beat it. I would order these again and purchase some for gifts &amp; my stock pile lol..:-)</li>
    <li> Trendy style and very useful</li>
    <li> I use these brushed to paint pottery. They were a fraction of the cost charges at a hobby store and work just as well</li>
    <li> These were horrible. I am a nail tech and I thought I would be cheap for some brushes for my own personal use around the house. Well, they clump and they are not clean. What I mean by that is when you go to clean the brush after you&#x27;re done, it is impossible to get all the acrylic off of them. The bristles tend to curl which make the next application process a pain in the bottom, and the only way to get rid of the stuck on acrylic that acetone won&#x27;t get rid of, is to cut the bristles. When I attempted to scrape off the acrylic after they soaked, the bristles came right out of the brush. I did not attempt gel nails with them however the title has them as acrylic nail art so I assumed very wrongly that they would be a good bargain. Save your money and get a better quality product. If you want to use polish only and use them strictly for designing, then one might be okay.</li>
    <li> Took forever to get here.!!! But good product great price.  I&#x27;ve ordered many items from over seas and they arrived much faster but this one took too freaking long for my liking...</li>
    <li> These are great brushes! I have used them to do acrylic nails and they work fantastic. They don&#x27;t get all messed up like some of the other brushes do after just one use. They are great brushes at a really great price! :)</li>
    <li> Excellent timing and the product just as described. i would recommend them 100%</li>
    <li> These brushes are great. Very precise. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love a great deal and great this is very nice and I didn&#x27;t have to spend a fortune I do a lot with acrylic so these will be tested very soon!</li>
    <li> not bad but not the best...  i find that the acrylic gets stuck easily to the brush so i am&lt;br /&gt;more times cleaning it then using it...</li>
    <li> good looking brushes and and comes with a cuticle pusher and the bottom of the brush</li>
    <li> Great for what i bought it for.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected. Can&#x27;t wait to do some 3d acrylic nail art with the smaller brushes. Thanks :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase</li>
    <li> nice product, but doesn&#x27;t really work with acrylic powder very well :(</li>
    <li> Excellent Product!!!!</li>
    <li> Great brushes! worked well with the acrylic, picks up nicely.</li>
    <li> Ordered these as a gift and they came quickly and as promised. They are good quality and hold  up well. Will order more when needed.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Love them this are very good</li>
    <li> I love this product it arrived early which is perfect cause I need new brushes and it came well packed and good product for the price. Will repurchase</li>
    <li> Brushes do not work with Acrylic. It makes the acrylic clump. Looks like their is some kind of film on burshes</li>
    <li> Horrible quality, go to a beauty supply shop</li>
    <li> Took a while to arrive, BUT actually arrived a few days earlier than the earliest quoted date. These feel sturdy and well made. I admit the material is a little light weight, but great quality for the price! This features sizes 4,6,8,10 and 12. A great variety for someone trying to find the right brush for them! Great purchase if you have the time to wait.</li>
    <li> The 350 x 5 pounds of our nail brushes what awesome I just got them and the mail having used them yet</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet but gave them a 5 star rating because I got them earlier than expected and think they will work great!</li>
    <li> They suck. The Brissles spread out and the shape is horrible. It took over a month to get here. NOT WORTH IT</li>
    <li> Good quality. I have enjoyed using them. I use them mostly for nail art purposes.</li>
    <li> these are not only lovely colours but are great for using on Gel nails!  thanks very much!! x much appreciated</li>
    <li> These brushes are kind of hard to clean but it&#x27;s nice having all of the sizes and the pretty colors work great for what they&#x27;re used for</li>
    <li> Arrived before time and does what they are supposed to do. Have already done 2 sets of acrylics and the brushes have held up with no signs of just falling apart.</li>
    <li> These brushes are perfect for doing nails, especially acrylic nails. I liked the variety in color and size. I was please with how sturdy they are. Some nail brushes want to come unglued at the joint where the metal is glued to the plastic, but these have held up nicely and I have had them for almost a year. Very pleased with product, seller and price.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing I am so glad I purchased these brushes I was looking for something that I could do 3d nail art and these are just perfect for that they come in 5 different sizes and are perfect for carving out and doing detail work.</li>
    <li> Took forever to get to me, but it was worth it for the price. You really only need the big one, but I would order again.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a fair quality brush ... N that&#x27;s what I got ... They are on the small size ... I dought they are the size they say they are ... I would not purchase these again</li>
    <li> Brushes look like good quality brushes. I am looking forward to trying them. I just received them todsy, so will be trying them shortly.</li>
    <li> i love how this set comes with many sizes you can do so much with each brush and so easy to use and clean</li>
    <li> I love my brushes, they are very durable and was shipped to me quickly:)</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> took a while to get here but did make it on estimated delivery date. haven&#x27;t got to use product yet but am excited with different sizes of brushes and colors. items arrived perfectly without any thing wrong. will probably as fast as i go through brushes order again.</li>
    <li> Was not fully pleased with the quality of these brushes.</li>
    <li> Loved these brushes super cheap too.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let your eyes fool you these aren&#x27;t the usual brushes you usually see in the salon.&lt;br /&gt;Theses are much smaller, the biggest brush was only big enough to pick up enough acrylic to cover  half of my nail beds.&lt;br /&gt;Which isn&#x27;t so bad since I have smaller nail beds,but it my vary finger to finger</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and all pieces were in tact.  Brushes work great. My daughter uses them at her beauty school every day. Great Deal !!!</li>
    <li> I actually haven&#x27;t used the yet I&#x27;m still wondering what I&#x27;ll use them for bc I don&#x27;t wanna do acrylic stuff with them, there&#x27;s a wide range of uses for them so I&#x27;ll figure it out, they&#x27;re sturdy</li>
    <li> Very poor quality. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> These were OK I guess, I was missing the number 10 brush and the bristles on the smallest one were all messed up and spread out. They&#x27;re good for practice I guess but not really if your actually trying to work on a client. I contacted the vendor and they refunded $1 to my account.</li>
    <li> these work really good, im still trying to get use to doing different art designs, but they are verry cool. delivery was ok. thanks</li>
    <li> Brushes no good after one use</li>
    <li> The brushes stand up to my every day use at school and all of the different types of monomers that I use</li>
    <li> These were good for the price but I need more practice with them much more cheaper then in the store!!!</li>
    <li> great brushes. sturdy. thanks i love them. tips work wonderfully and sticks arent cheap so i love it all alot</li>
    <li> Only got to use these things twice!  The hairs on the brush will fall apart and they will turn your acrylic yellow after the 2nd use.  I know for a fact it&#x27;s not my acrylic!</li>
    <li> Good nail brushes! And has a cuticle pusher on the opposite end!!</li>
    <li> Got it after a week, great condition. The opposite ends of the brushes are angled, good for many uses.</li>
    <li> Does what theyre supposed to do</li>
    <li> I love these brushes! They are easy to clean and the bristles do not fall out. They do have a professional quality and I love the colors!</li>
    <li> I got these thinking that maybe if I dipped them in acetone after every nail they would still be usable. I did that and even after it was impossible to get the product out of the brush. I wish I could have kept it but I couldn&#x27;t because there was no way to clean it. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. If you are doing nail polish maybe, if you are working with acrylic powder and liquid NO. I was very sad because they&#x27;re pretty and soft  but are terrible.</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking they would last but the acrylic powder bundles up in the middle of brush. after i clean with brush cleaner they are the same. sorry they did not wok for me.</li>
    <li> Awesome colors and you get the whole set shown! One of them separated from the Brussels the others seem to hang onto the acrylic powder, so I soaked them in acetone to clean.</li>
    <li> These are great, very pretty and match the dotting tools that I had ordered previously. I haven&#x27;t used them for acrylics YET, but I did look them over and they are like other acrylic brushes and see, to be of good quality.</li>
    <li> I really like the product I ordered! It came in a very timely manner!</li>
    <li> These work brilliantly, only thing is you have to wait a month to get them in the mail. But when I did get them they work great I have tiny hands so I use the smaller one but if I do anyone&#x27;s nails I&#x27;ll have the correct size for them! really is nice</li>
    <li> these are very pretty brushes, and they fell good also, I would recommend them for any nail artist.  they are brushes and they do what they are suppose to do.</li>
    <li> I bought these when I first started doing my own acrylic nails.  They did an ok job but getting the acrylic out of them was extremely difficult at times.  I did end up buying some more expensive brushes for applying the acrylic and I haven&#x27;t used these brushes since then..</li>
    <li> I love it. I use it for acrylics, not for gel</li>
    <li> These are great brushes but I was looking for something finer so I can put on more details to my nail art. They are very good quality brushes for the price though. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to use with my acrylic nails and they get the job done.  My only complain is that the brush is so soft that the acrylic bonds with the hairs so I&#x27;ve already had to dispose of the brush I was using.  Haven&#x27;t got a chance to use with the gel yet.  For the price I am very happy with my brushes.</li>
    <li> These are great quality brushes especially for the price.  These brushes also maintain there shape even after use, O ordered another set.</li>
    <li> Great brushes for nail art! Makes beautiful 3d art! Not a single problem, I&#x27;ve been doing nails for 8 years and these were great! Maybe those who had problems don&#x27;t know how to do acrylics? I certainly would not use these to fill or do fullsets!</li>
    <li> I think the brushes have a very good texture very soft! Perfect for acrylic! And the good thing of it is that the pack comes with different sizes if brushes for your comfort😄</li>
    <li> These are great brushes, although i was expecting bigger bristles they work just fine. If your into 3d nail art these are great and also good with acrylic! The acrylic balls don&#x27;t get stuck in the brush bristles!!!!!! And pretty COLORSS !!! I LOVE THEM &amp;#60;333</li>
    <li> I took a chance @ buying these brushes...I received a #4 #8 #9 #10 and a #12..I. Wish they had a bigger brush than #12..but for the price it isn&#x27;t bad @ all..the bristles don&#x27;t fall out like other brushes...and they all have a cuticle pusher @ each end of the acrylic brushes #good brushes</li>
    <li> Love the brushes very good quality. The bristles look like they are strong and will stay in and not jus be falling out when I use them. Also love the shaper of the brush heads perfect for detail application.</li>
    <li> I recieved the parcel on time but when I used the brushes some of the bristles started falling out. Overall they work pretty good</li>
    <li> I bought these to use for acrylic, but the bristles on each of the brushes seemed glued together.  I tried soaking in monomer to no avail.  They would, however, be usable for pushing back the cuticle.  Bottom line is that they are not useable for acrylics.  I&#x27;ll give them to the kids to use for water colors.</li>
    <li> Great brushes works well when applying for my manicures, a great set for a good price will buy again thank you</li>
    <li> The handles are cute, but the bristles are hard and look like they are glued/stuck together. It looks like they have been used already. I watched a video on youtube and the girl&#x27;s bristles were soft. I know this product is cheap, but I wanted softer bristles. I just received mine today I was so excited until I looked at the bristles and my smile vanished. I was happy the shipping was quick so I give a thumbs up for that. So I guess I have to buy $10 brushes to be satisfied.</li>
    <li> They are good brushes I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them but I had to throw one away cuz I didn&#x27;t know acrylic liquid melts plastic and I used a plastic container to hold some in and put the brush in and ruined it so yeah they are great!</li>
    <li> Horrible. My monomer ate through the brushes and the acrylic gets stuck soo quickly on the brushes.</li>
    <li> ordered the brushes used them once and the bottom came out and on top of that they wouldn&#x27;t seen another pack of brushes I DO NOT RECOMMEND this seller</li>
    <li> Loved this brushes. They are brushes and also you can use them for the perfect manicure. i am very pleased with this buying. I would definitely recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> I bought these to try acrylics for the first time. They did the job wonderfully. I enjoy the larger sizes, the small feel hard to work with. One piece of advice is make sure to clean out all the acrylic out of the brush before you let it dry. You can do this by soaking it in the monomer for about a minute, placing it on paper towel, and running something like a dotting tool through it to get out any acrylic clumps. I ordered brush cleaner because the first brush I used I let a large clump of acrylic dry in it.</li>
    <li> I love them they are really cute and you have to know how to used before using it because you can get them deranged</li>
    <li> The hairs don&#x27;t come out &amp; are very easy to clean.  I have left acrylic on it to dry several times &amp; it comes off for me each time I clean it &amp; goes back to it&#x27;s original shape.  Would buy these again &amp; recommend them.</li>
    <li> not good they came apart after the first use i couldnt believe it i got mad what to expect at a low cost</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ve used 3 of the 5 for doing acrylic nails and they lost their shape while I was using them for the first time and even after I cleaned them up the brush cleaner, The bristles wouldn&#x27;t stay in their proper shape in order to use them. I&#x27;ve had to get my brushes from another sours. I was happy at first, but when they just did very odd things the first time I used them. I was a bit disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;SF-P</li>
    <li> Im another satisfied customer. This product is just like the picture and description. Very sturdy and durable. Not to mention it make you feel professional when you use it on other ladies nails. I recommend all nail stylist to purchase one.</li>
    <li> This brushes is crap &#x27;not good at all.</li>
    <li> I want to thank you for the speed in which I received the brushes.  I made them a gift to the girl who does my nails.  She loved them.</li>
    <li> very usable brushes like the colors will work well for beauty school.  The person I bought them for loved them.</li>
    <li> Very well made brushes for the price! I&#x27;ll be buying more for my friends!</li>
    <li> they absorbed the acrylic powder in the bristles rather then having it stay on the one side of the brush, i will clean them and use them for arts and crafts, they are very pretty and came on time but as for an &amp;#34;acrylic nail brush&amp;#34; they worked poorly. i actually threw out my old brush when they came and after a few fingers and 2 brushes later i got out my old brush from the top of the trash can and finnished my nails.</li>
    <li> Great brushes.  store nicely in their little plastic case.  cheap enough... They&#x27;re great!  They work great for cleaning up nail polish from my cuticles and should do nicely for nail art.</li>
    <li> arrived earlier than promised. well packaged - so far so good! just as described and the 1 brush i tested has not gone bald!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this product Bc the brushes are not good quality and the brushes are flimsy and weak and I think it&#x27;s only good for nail polish removing if messed up :-/</li>
    <li> I normaly like everything I get on amazon from all sellers but these were sub par they clumped up as soon as I used them the only reason I did not try and get my money back is because they were very cheap so in this case it was definitely you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> OK these 5 pc acrylic art uv gel carving pen liquid powder brushes are  really really nice and they are cute too</li>
    <li> So I love these brushes I thought they were really cool and different sizes but the first time i used to them the end just came off there well not well put together</li>
    <li> These are great if you no what you are doing</li>
    <li> I HAVE ONLY USED THESE ONCE, BECAUSE THE BRISTLES COME OUT OF THE BRUSH AS SOON AS I STARTED USING THEM. HAD TO FILE DOWN A NAIL &amp; RE-DO- TRIED 3 DIFF ONES.</li>
    <li> They work okay but fall apart you can just pull it apart. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> These brushes were amazing! I really loved them! They are the perfect size and they are just working great! Thanks</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes.  I love the handles - they are clear with a very cute design inside that looks like 3D - and the end of the brushes can be used as a scrapper to clean a mess up on the nail.  The smaller brushes are perfect for nail art and the 2 larger brushes I wanted to use for acrylic. I like my acrylic brushes to be a little stubby to help mold better and not separate.  These brushes are a little long for me to do that.  I actually took scissors and cut the 2 bigger brushes down to make them more to my liking,  That worked great!  I was able to apply my acrylic perfectly and the bristles are very durable.</li>
    <li> these brushes were horrible. none of them were big enough to apply the acrylic properly. also they were very hard to clean and I was never able to get all the material out. these brushes also weren&#x27;t shaped correctly for there use. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend, I guess you get what you pay for so ppl don&#x27;t be cheap.</li>
    <li> i bought these to get into acrylic nails, but the fumes from the acrylic liquid made me punt that endeavor. but, when i used these on my first set of acrylic nails, they were nice and stiff and really good for shaping the nails. i also use these to clean up my regular nail art if i get nail polish on the areas around my nail and to also do some other nail art with the smaller brushes. they are also so cute and cheap!</li>
    <li> It took a while to receive I haven&#x27;t used them but to me they a not as big of brush that is picture but i thinking for what I paid it will do</li>
    <li> I purchased this brushes and at first was disappointed with them but after I contacted the seller they sent me new ones and  I read the reviews which helped me with acrylic build in the brushes.</li>
    <li> I still have not gotten my brushes ! I would like my money back or see the brushes in the mail box. I&#x27;ve been waiting 2 almost 3 months for them. I can&#x27;t wait any longer</li>
    <li> Good brushes. Very happy</li>
    <li> Love my new brushes can&#x27;t wait to use them. They are exactly what I needed and the sellers description is so accurate. I only gave 4 stars cuz I haven&#x27;t used them yet so hopefully they&#x27;ll be to my liking.</li>
    <li> I love these. I&#x27;m an amature at applying acrylic nails, so I&#x27;m not sure if these are the right brushes for the job. They work pretty well so far for my own standards. They do get gunked up pretty quickly with acrylic so I soak the bristles with nail polish remover. They haven&#x27;t fallen apart or frayed yet.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to work with acrylic but these seem to fall apart and loose the brissel how ever good with gel</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these. Perfect sizes. Gives a great variety and they are great quality. A must have for nail techs.</li>
    <li> I bought an acrylic nail set and the brush was not big enough for me. I saw these and for the price I figured heck why not? They came about 2 weeks later and they arrived in good shape. They do work really well with minimal shedding they have not messed up my nail designs because of stray hairs or anything. It comes with a pack of 5 brushes and a plastic holding case. For the price these cant be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds product well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Constructed well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minimal shedding</li>
    <li> I like these and I think they are really cute. They are not made of some cheap material these can be used professionally.</li>
    <li> I thought that I was getting a good deal on nail brushes. I used these to refill my nails and these brushes are horrible. They do not stay together, they separate while in use. I would not recommend these at all. Will prob. just use the for some painting project.</li>
    <li> Please Do NOT BUY..&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are unusable, I couldn&#x27;t get a single nail done.&lt;br /&gt;I should&#x27;ve listened to my gut instinct and the bad reviews</li>
    <li> I received my brushes and tried the out. The brushes are flimsy and they shed. I like that the tips are pointed but it&#x27;s too flimsy for acrylic use. My husband is an artist so I&#x27;ll be giving him the brushes to details paint with</li>
    <li> these are terrible for acrylic i would not suggest any one to buy these just invest in some expensive ones</li>
    <li> These nail brushes hair bristles are hard like a rock. Even dipped on water, monomer and used good gel nails they never get soft.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with these brushes! They are worth every penny! I am looking forward to using them .</li>
    <li> These are supposed to be nail brushes, but I bought them as&lt;br /&gt;regular paint brushes to use for watercolors or other paints a&lt;br /&gt;young child might use. Good deal!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no professional at doing nails, but these brushes didn&#x27;t hold their shape, went out like a fan somewhat. They did the trick in putting on the acrylic, but I&#x27;ll try something else next time.</li>
    <li> These worked out great, they are worth the wait! They are comparable to ones that I get here but they cost so much less.</li>
    <li> I ordered 5 brushes and I received 5 brushes.  I&#x27;ve only used one so far and have experienced no problems, I don&#x27;t anticipate any problems with other 4 as they all seem to be the same quality as I&#x27;ve found in stores.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use these yet but I love the look of them. The brush tips look like they will be just fine.</li>
    <li> I actually use these as concealer brushes for tiny imperfections. It works great and it&#x27;s half the price of one &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; concealer brush. Most concealer brushes are too large for little imperfections. But these brushes come in a few different sizes and can get a pimple covered like magic. :) hope this helps someone.</li>
    <li> They work very well. I am very satisfied with this product. I love to work with the way they work. Very fast delivery. I could not have asked for better service. Great job. Thank you</li>
    <li> Love them! They even came early!!!</li>
    <li> Works well with nails and art</li>
    <li> Really nice brushes.  Good quality and affordable.  It arrived quickly and as advertised.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> These are great brushes. I am a &amp;#34;rookie at home nail technician&amp;#34; :) and I started out with a sally beauty supply brush. Just one was $16! It was awful and only lasted me 3 applications. What a waste of money. I saw these and read the reviews and decided to go for it. I&#x27;m glad I did. What a great value! They are are high quality for the price, comfortable/effortless to hold, nice colors on brush handle, and super easy for this beginner to use! I like the smaller sized brushes because I am still developing my product ratio skills. My suggestion to any beginners out there trying to do their acrylics at home: buy these brushes and use ASP dual nail forms! It&#x27;s a great way to start and you&#x27;ll be happy with your results!</li>
    <li> Sucky product. The handles were broken when I received so I didn&#x27;t even get a chance to test out the actual brushes...</li>
    <li> These work as they&#x27;re supposed to. Easy to clean. Doesn&#x27;t shed. I use them to do my acrylic nails and gel nails.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THEM AND THE PRICE IS VERY CHEAP..IF YOU WANT TO FLATTEN THE BRUSH JUST USE CLEAR NAIL POLISH FLATTEN IT OUT AND LET IT SIT FOR ABOUT 3 DAYS THEN CLEAN BRUSH WITH NAIL BRUSH CLEANER</li>
    <li> I recevied my order very early i love the brush i do thank-you so much i&#x27;m glad i found all size of brush i need. God Bless you</li>
    <li> they did a great job, i used them while i was in nail school but decided acrylic was not for me and stuck to gel, so i gave them to a friend and she liked em and is still using them. they&#x27;re definitely better than what you pay for, not the best but good quality for such a cheap price</li>
    <li> i thought they were for laying acrylic, because i didnt read the headline, but i still like them and use them for the right reasons lol</li>
    <li> Very nice&lt;br /&gt;Different sizes too</li>
    <li> I wouldnt use these brushes if you are high tech on nails .They are easy to manage but become kind of raged after a few uses.</li>
    <li> The brushes are a bit better than I expected. I use them for acrylic nails and they hold up pretty well. The hairs hold up, but require a bit more attention to keep to their point shape. Overall, a good buy for its price and quality.</li>
    <li> Love using these! Different sizes for different areas or just smaller or larger nails!</li>
    <li> Good price, but you should change the description info since it says that those brushes are for acrylic when the truth is that they are for gel.&lt;br /&gt;I bought them because the description said that those were good for acrylic.</li>
    <li> Did not meet my standardz</li>
    <li> the provider responsible good experience , impeccable product , I recommend it with my eyes closed , waiting for more credits to repurchase them</li>
    <li> The brushes are great they are perfect for doing nails and as well as painting. Every nail artist should have a set.</li>
    <li> nice brushes different colora and aizws got at a good prce so that lakes me happy ajd seems to work qell.the brushees when i tryed thwm</li>
    <li> I recieved them before the deadline. I haven&#x27;y had the chance to use them yet but they look in good shape I still have to try them though Hope there as good as they look</li>
    <li> lovvvvvvvvvvvve these brushes  and they work so good.. would order more and they look so nice in the cup... a big 5 star for them.</li>
    <li> Received within shipping time frame, was able to use them for my acrylic nail powders and liquid, seemed to do what they claim to do, I just haven&#x27;t cleaned them off after applying so now they&#x27;re kind of ..dried and glued together, my own fault though.</li>
    <li> I thought these would be great, but they were a waste of money. : (  they fell apart, every one of them, after just one use each. do not waste your money on these brushes.</li>
    <li> extremely happy with my purchase of these nail brushes. very good quality brushes for the money. the colorful handles are cute.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with these brushes!  They aren&#x27;t as big as they look in the photo but they&#x27;re just fine since I&#x27;m not a professional at acrylic. They are all different sizes which is convenient and at the end of each brush is a cuticle pusher so that&#x27;s handy so I don&#x27;t need to keep buying Orangewood sticks all the time. Packaging is good, none of the brushes were broken or anything :)</li>
    <li> These brushes are easy to use and quality distributes acrylic liquid n powder on nails it was so goo i had to but another it is a must have.</li>
    <li> Love it!! came in right on time love the colors not easily to break that&#x27;s even better thank you so much !!</li>
    <li> Very nice. Like the beveled end for clean up.</li>
    <li> Perfect no thing wrong and works wonderful!!! Would recommend</li>
    <li> Good brushes,  strong high quality bristels, easy to grasp even in a small hand.</li>
    <li> These are great quality brushes and they look so cute!! I have other brushes similar to these and the hair fell out on a few of them already but the hair on these haven&#x27;t!! And I love how the ends of these can be used as cuticle pushers. Will definitely be buying more and I recommend it :)</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes, work great.</li>
    <li> Love them, I dont regret buying them work really good . I live in Florida and I got themin 2 weeks. I thought it would be in my hands a month I guess I was wrong im varry happy</li>
    <li> These are a great set of brushes. I will totally buy these again. They clean well and are looking to be holding up just fine.</li>
    <li> This is no good....doesn&#x27;t hold acrylic, and the brush open s up all ugly after first use</li>
    <li> These are ok I found them to be a bit too stiff.</li>
    <li> Love them!! Comes With #2, #4, #6, #8, #10 perfect for me because I&#x27;m kinda just starting out with DIY acrylic nails</li>
    <li> They work fine on the nails I need to repair. It will work well with the other nail care items.</li>
    <li> These sucked for me idk if it was the acrylic powder or the brush. The acrylic stuck to the brush like glue it was soooo disappointing, plus they aren&#x27;t professional so what can you expect. What I do love is that the bottoms of the brushes are cuticle pushers! That&#x27;s a plus but the fibers on the brush suck. save money to buy a good brand</li>
    <li> NEVER RECIEVED MY PACKAGE</li>
    <li> Wish had more big brushes, not so many small...guess it&#x27;s up to u what u like or prefer</li>
    <li> They only lasted me for maybe 3 usea each</li>
    <li> Thank u  ordered 5 more. Love them.</li>
    <li> I ordered Feb. 1 &amp; deliver Mar.10 I got this set to match the set of dotting pens I also ordered &amp; the colors are not as they appear on the picture. I got pink, white, yellow, purple, &amp; royal blue. It was supposed to be pink, white, yellow, lime green, &amp; light blue. Now I have miss matches sets. &amp; I don&#x27;t want an exchange because it&#x27;s going to take me longer to return &amp;,wait for another set. Also The brush part also seems to be on the smaller side.  Looks so much better on picture than in person.</li>
    <li> Great nail brushes for the price. I am an amateur who does her own acrylic nails and the brushes I had been using get clumpy and hard before finishing my nails. This brush did not clump and cleaned up well.</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE BRUSHES, an amazing deal for the price. I will defiently order more and recommend these brushes to others.</li>
    <li> I love them a lot only use 2 one the hairs did come out but Im still loving them and will buy them again thanks</li>
    <li> Great deal, This item is just what I needed to go in my collection of nail products. They really do the job. Thanks</li>
    <li> really good product for different things, i use them for nail art and they were great because i had all different sizes to use for all different desings.</li>
    <li> The quallity isla not good</li>
    <li> Cool design on the brushes.</li>
    <li> After receiving and LOVING the five dotting tools, I decided to get the matching nail art brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really can&#x27;t do any intricate designs with these, they&#x27;re too thick.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t spread easily, leaving the polish thick where i put it to the nail and then stringy where I drag it.&lt;br /&gt;And after using them once, they DO NOT wash off. I&#x27;ve tried getting the nail polish off, and sometimes I can get it all out. However then, the bristles get hard and stick together and basically can no longer be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found a use for them though, which is dipping them in polish remover and running it around my nails afterwards to get rid of the mess and hard edges.</li>
    <li> The brushes are great. They are bright and I love them already.</li>
    <li> loved it good for 3d nail art or gel not for trying to do full acrylic set</li>
    <li> Got these and they are as pictured. I have not used them yet but they seem like they will be fine. I&#x27;ve not seen anything falling apart or loose hairs so time will tell.</li>
    <li> The hair falls out immediately!!! Horrible brushes!</li>
    <li> came way before due date very good</li>
    <li> I had bought other brushes for more and they all got messed up, this is the only place that I know that I get 5 different sizes for a good price. I only used it once and so far so good...</li>
    <li> eh. These brushes will hold me over until i can save up for better brushes. I really have to work that acrylic in there and press down hard for it to work the way I want it. But overall, they are good starter brushes.</li>
    <li> They are bad brushed but cheap as well. Do not recommend with a few extra bucks you can buy a real acrylic brush that will make your life easier! State board doesn&#x27;t recommend these because the liquid doesn&#x27;t really travel trough the bristles of the brush which can get the monomer all over the finger which may cause an allergic reaction!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my daughter and she love them.</li>
    <li> Awesome brushes for the price!</li>
    <li> These were a gift for my nail tech at my local salon so I can&#x27;t tell you how well they work because she hasn&#x27;t told me anything as of yet but as soon as I know you all will know!</li>
    <li> A must for every nail tech. Great price fast shipping.</li>
    <li> These are good for the price!</li>
    <li> Still have these, good brushes.</li>
    <li> I really like these. I like the multiple uses. I use the white one and blue one for clean up and the green one for disinfecting the under side of the clients nails during a fill in. I use the pink and yellow mostly for my acrylic work.</li>
    <li> I am still using these brushes they have held shape and they have not shed.  I feel like these are a reward for all the money I have wasted on more expensive brushes over the years.  I do have to admit I am meticulous with my brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start with a wet brush using whatever solution is in your powder, maintain a wet brush throughout your application,&lt;br /&gt;end with a wet brush that has been wet and wiped on a paper towel and finger cleaned,&lt;br /&gt;NEVER put any brush down with Acrylic on it.  When completely finished clean with acetone,&lt;br /&gt;Then mild soap and water, reshape, recap, and let dry and put away for future use.&lt;br /&gt;Yes that little plastic piece on the tip of the brush is there for a reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the end as a cuticle pusher but as an aid in detailing, or moving acrylic this spade-shape-end is the perfect of this .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Common sense is not so common if you have never DIY.&lt;br /&gt;Follow these simple tips and these brushes will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;And they are very inexpensive,  less than the cost of one brush at a beauty supply store.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these brushes</li>
    <li> The acrylic sticks so heavily in the brushes I sometimes have to clean them in between nails. I am happy with the two smaller brushes for 3d and detail acrylic. However it&#x27;s more worth buying a real sable brush for doing nails.</li>
    <li> These are great for me to use for my at home application of my acrylic nails.  The are small but does the job.</li>
    <li> took a month to arrive and it&#x27;s just an okay product, not the best quality, but hey I got them for really cheap so for a beginner it&#x27;s ok. for professional, stay away! get the more expensive ones with a better quality!</li>
    <li> They are really cheap when they arrived they where falling apart and i had to tighten them since the hairs fell off and they are really stiff not so god</li>
    <li> NOT THE RIGHT ONES!!!!!</li>
    <li> Ecellent the product and the shipping service also.  I´m very satisfied with this product and service.  My congratulations.  Regards.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes and they are perfect for acrylic nails.</li>
    <li> Very good for profesional salon</li>
    <li> It came to me very fast it came before the set date which I loved the brushes are nice they don&#x27;t fall out</li>
    <li> These are pretty good brushes. Can&#x27;t say I have any problems with them. They do what they&#x27;re suppose to. i don&#x27;t know, I like them a lot!</li>
    <li> These do not work very well with acrylic at all! They absorb the acrylic and get gunked up! But it is easy to find other uses for them, they clean easy, and they came early. I can&#x27;t complain too much!</li>
    <li> I have not used these yet, but they look just as good as any acrylic brushes in starter kits, I am a beginner, so I love the price1</li>
    <li> Im very happy with my items. I will order from again. With these new brushes, I will be able to do better nails. Thank you</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with the quality of these brushes, and with the speed with which it was sent. I have enjoyed using these.</li>
    <li> These brushes work perfect for the application and detailing of Gel Nail Art.  The larger brush provides the base and overall coating of the nail, while the smaller ones give opportunity for detail and artwork to be inlaid into the design.</li>
    <li> Color on here are bright they are what they say they are in the picture . All different size I will buy them again soon !</li>
    <li> I am constantly doing my own acrylic nails and these brushes are great.</li>
    <li> These are worth it.  They are low price but has a decent quality.</li>
    <li> Just got them and I love them !</li>
    <li> Hair fell off the first usage</li>
    <li> Came in 2 weeks earlier then expected. Love them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reviewing the 5pcs Acrylic Nail Art UV Gel Carving Pen Brush Liquid Powder DIY No. 2/4/6/8/10. For starters I received my item way before the expected delivery date. Im so happy with my purchase I love these brushes this item was packaged nicely works great with applying uv builder gel are applying gel nails. Get them you won&#x27;t be disappointed I&#x27;m not.</li>
    <li> They work and look amazing</li>
    <li> What you see in the pic is exactly what you get....Miniature brushed that are useless to use as acrylis nail with powder or even gel brushes.  They ship from China...so they took FOREVER getting here about 3 1/2 weeks. Don&#x27;t wasted your $$$ or time. Go to Sallys and get one.</li>
    <li> These 5 pc. acrylic nail art brushes are great....my daughter and I have our weekly nail art parties and these will definitely come in handy...it&#x27;s nice to have several brushes for the different color acrylic that you use for nail art.  Can&#x27;t wait to start designing.</li>
    <li> For practice purposes these are a really good buy and I will use these until I can buy ones of a slightly better quality. They work really well for what I need them for and hold up pretty good too. I could use these on my clients once I get out of school as I have already used them more than a dozen times on myself. Oh and they came early too.</li>
    <li> Work for me so far! Great for acrylic work</li>
    <li> Sucked. These are plastic brushes</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Exactly what you see in the pic.  Very nice.  Exactly what you see in the pic.  Very nice.  Exactly what you see in the pic.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t fall apart.  Soft brushes.  Easy to use. Very pretty colors.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very thick and have too many bristles. What happens is it is hard to shape the acrylic without making dents. The brush doesn&#x27;t flow smoothly over the paste, so it comes out lumpy. It much easier with a brush that is a little thinner and longer and also the pointed tip makes it harder in my opinion</li>
    <li> Bought these brushes to go with the UV Gel I had bought for applying to nails. Exactly as pictured, very functional :-)</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes because I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on an acrylic brush,good price, The brushes came  very fast it came before the set date, Brush Size: #4, #6, #8, #10, #12, It is safe and easily to be used, ready to try them out in a few days, only i got one brush that is not the same like the others, colorful handles makes it fun to work with them, but at the end, i&#x27;m happy with my order.</li>
    <li> I love the various sizes easy to hold and work with and clean the colorful handles makes it fun to work with we all have them in our nail salon great value thank you so much ill order more soon to have extra on hand love them</li>
    <li> This got useless after the first use with acrylic, it detached from the metal part . long history short: are not good at all</li>
    <li> IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT BUYING THESE TO DO ACRYLIC NAILS.. DONT!! THESE ARE FLIMSY AND VERY CHEAPLY MADE !</li>
    <li> These were so inexpensive that I was worried about the quality, but these are excellent! The bristles are sturdy and I have not had any fall out. The handles are pretty, with their swirly clear colors, and the brush heads are well attached.&lt;br /&gt;Even if one had been unusable they would be a bargain, but all five of mine are perfect making this quite the deal!</li>
    <li> These brushes are not really wide enough to quickly apply acrylic (for me, anyway).  If you can apply quickly, they&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes because I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on an acrylic brush for my at-home manicures/pedicures, as that would defeat the purpose of saving money by doing my own nails.  The brushes are exactly as pictured, so no complaints so far.  The brushes arrived in bubble packaging and in-tact.  The ship window was to be 4-6 weeks, but I received them in 3 weeks.  I can&#x27;t vouch for the quality as of yet because I&#x27;ve not used them, but I will update my review as soon as I do.</li>
    <li> these Brushes are great They Are Soft And colrful i love the way the colors swirl on the handles and the fact that you can use the other end of the brush as a Cuticle Pusher</li>
    <li> shipping was fanstatic, the product was as desribed. i can finally do our nails with out the mess thease are the same as the salon.</li>
    <li> Sizes are right, product described by the seller is correct. Came earlier than expected, came in a box none were broken. I haven&#x27;t used them yet but looks like they are a god quality.</li>
    <li> these brushes are the best.. So far i have only used the size 12 brush and these brushes are great... lays down acrylic smooth and solid.. i know that using acrylic becomes better with practice but these brushes makes a big difference... so far I gives them a thumbs up</li>
    <li> thank you ....great product</li>
    <li> The brushes are cheaply made, but you get what you pay for.  I only do my own nails at home so they will do for now!</li>
    <li> Love how all brushes are different example don&#x27;t have to use a big brush to fix a little problem.</li>
    <li> These work great with acrylic powder and are easy to clean and have kept their shape. I expect them to last a long time with good cleaning.</li>
    <li> Overall good brushes.  I believe they work better with gels than acrylics.</li>
    <li> No thank u. Everyone of the brushes absorbed too much i would go buy somewhere else and save yourself the money</li>
    <li> i TOOK A CHANCE IN PURCHASING THESE BRUSHES ONLINE WITHOUT SEEING THEM.  I AM COMPLETELY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SATISFIED WITH THEM.  THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m ham-fisted when it comes to ANYTHING. I&#x27;m like Wreck-It Ralph, but that never stops me from DIY projects.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes make painting with UV Gel so easy, especially since the tips are pointed. I&#x27;m so glad these exist, it kind of looks like I know what I&#x27;m doing. Also, it no longer looks like a 5 year old did my nails.</li>
    <li> Easy to handle and great because they come in different shapes and sizes so you can pick which one you like.</li>
    <li> having a blast using all the brushes. The small ones are great for doing 3d nail art with. Great price, got them before the expected delivery date and they seem like a great quality, definitely for the price. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love these. And I noticed the person who does my nails also uses these</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for about 2 years now and they are still in great shape! Perfect for a DIY kind of person! You can use these for applying acrylic, but I also dip them in nail polish remover to do french tip, etc.!</li>
    <li> I have petite nails and these work fine for me. I&#x27;ve washed them a few times and they still hold up, no bristles have fallen out. I will be buying these again if mine need replacing.</li>
    <li> Work like a charm, super simple and easy to use. I love the variety, you SHOULD clean these regularly do to not wanting them to bond with the acrylic powder. NO shedding, at all.</li>
    <li> they came earlier than expected! they are awesome brushes and are good quality ! for the dollar and something i paid , they are perfect ! i use them all the time !</li>
    <li> These are great brushes for beginners. They are made well for the price and shipped fast, would recommend these for someone just starting out with acrylic</li>
    <li> One of them broke immediately. The rest work well.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to do my acrylic nails, and they are wonderful! They arrived about two weeks earlier than expected, and they work great as long as you take care of them.</li>
    <li> there okay took forever better of paying for authentic brushes if using acrylic</li>
    <li> They work well but kinda frey easy</li>
    <li> order came on time. love it I would consider them to  anyone I bought this product because I want to learn how to do nails.</li>
    <li> I rated these acrylic brushes 5 stars because they really work good when using them. i loved how i received them on time, i didn&#x27;t dislike anything about these brushes. i would definitely recommend these brushes to buyers. You won&#x27;t regret buying them!</li>
    <li> i received it and now i haven&#x27;t been able to use it cause i work so much but i&#x27;m sure i will find the time.</li>
    <li> These low coast brushes are helpful to have around. Well worth the price. And you can never have enough brushes for your nails.</li>
    <li> This product came a WEEK early and absolutely love my brushes. First of the packaging was not pretty but once i saw the brushes they were shiny, smooth and in perfect condition. They come in a range of sizes from #2 - #10. They were worth the price.</li>
    <li> love the brushes but they tend to clog up super easy.</li>
    <li> these are not real acrylic brushes!!!! dont buy the acrylic sticks to the brush while applying making nail harder to put on</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! Great for shaping acrylic nails and it did better then the $10 brush I bought from a local beauty store. They do need cleaning but I was able to get all the acrylic out off the brushes. Very happy with the brushes and I will buy them again when I need to replace them.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes and how they come in diffrent sizes i love the color on them they are pretty creative and keep the creativeness flowing very happy with my brushes</li>
    <li> These brushes are great for the money.  They arrived quickly.  I am just learning and its great to be abel to buy quality brushes. Thanks</li>
    <li> I expected the brushes to be fuller and much bigger and it wasn&#x27;t that way.  I&#x27;m not excited at all, but it&#x27;s okay!</li>
    <li> The price was perfect and the quality is great! Personally, a couple of the brushes were a little bit to big to use on my nails, but the rest are perfect. I&#x27;m very happy with my experience with the seller and the product. I will order from them again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet so not sure if i like them or not but at least it was cheap</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR DOING LIQUID POWDER ON NAILS. NICE DESIGN AND EASY TO USE. REALLY RECOMMEND IT TO THOSE WHO ARE INTO DOING ACRYLIC NAILS.</li>
    <li> I really do like this brushes they are nice and very inexpensive. They&#x27;re very easy to work with. :) :)</li>
    <li> i got these to do the acrylic powder on my nails and they are great i would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a great brush. they come in the sizes shown and the colors shown as well...</li>
    <li> These brushes are extremely cheap and hard. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying. The wait time for these brushes makes the anticipation a dissapoitnment</li>
    <li> THE BRUSHES ARE JUST LIKE THE NAIL SALON AND ARE EASY TO USE AND VERY EASY TO CLEAN. I LIKE THE COLORS AND EASE OF USE. I WILL BUY THE BRUSHES AGAIN IF I NEED TO.</li>
    <li> They seem like good brushes. Got to use it once and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. They&#x27;re only made of plastic so I&#x27;m not expecting them to last forever. It was a decent price for them and they arrived faster than I thought they would so....all in all I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> They are hard at first but wetting them a bit and drying them and they turn more soft, they work good and are a good quality. They can be clean with some non acetone and wash the residue with water and it isn&#x27;t damage after.</li>
    <li> Top acrylic brushes! Work well with product. Love the color and clean up well! Acrylic goes on smooth, I will purchase again and again!! Love it!</li>
    <li> Took over a month to get, and they are much smaller than I expected. Don&#x27;t think I will be able to use them for any thing.</li>
    <li> Pretty good for the price. It gets the job done and I will be purchasing another set to have as backup.</li>
    <li> I just got them today and it came fast before the estimate time!  I thought it would be late but it wasn&#x27;t!! Thanks Nicky&#x27;s Gift.</li>
    <li> These brushes shouls not be used to do acrylic nails. The acrylic just sticks to the brushes i had to wash and wash and wash them totally not worth the time. Going to keep them for other things. Hope they work for that at least. My 3 year old will love them for crafting.</li>
    <li> VERY PRETTY COLORS AND I LOVE THE DIFFERENT SIZES INCLUDED. HAVENT NECESSARYLY STARTED DOING MY OWN NAILS BUT DEF A GOOD START ON GETTING SUPPLIES</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for with this product. These aren&#x27;t even good enough for practice for amateurs. Don&#x27;t bother buying if being used to acrylics.</li>
    <li> These brushes are no good they don&#x27;t work well with acrylic? These brushes are made for water coloring. It is hard to get the power out of these brushes!</li>
    <li> Great my wife loves it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally inexpensive for the value you obtain for it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a very smart purchase, I hope we can do business in future</li>
    <li> Love this brush it is really easy to handle and it make really good in a French manicure and its great</li>
    <li> Arrived faster than I thought they would!  I love the colors and the design of the handles.  I have only had to use one so far and I will admit I had to put a little elbow grease into the cleaning, but that&#x27;s how some things are :)  I would recommend these to anybody who does their own nails.</li>
    <li> The shipping was alot faster than expected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT the reviews are right, the color sticks to the brush and you CANNOT get it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you dont mind cleaning your brush after every swipe then I would buy these.&lt;br /&gt;Not what I expected, I ignored all the bad reviews but they are right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hard to manage and work with and keeps all the color in the brush</li>
    <li> A little too stiff for acrylic</li>
    <li> I was excited to get these but they broke as soon as I took them out of the package.  The brush tips came off of all them when I tried to remove the plastic protector.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for, I brought these in the pass they are ok if your looking for something disposable. With a up and coming event I brought these again so I could do 3D  nail art on my nails after using a kolinsky brush to do the full set. I plan on throwing these away when done. From pass experience they don&#x27;t last and product will get stuck on the bristles.</li>
    <li> Cosmetology student must buy, sister in law enjoys this product and price. Already was helping with her practice on nails for future customers.</li>
    <li> I love how thick the brushes are, the sizes were just what I was looking for, perfect for acrylic nails!</li>
    <li> If you want to do acrylic nails spend the money and get a GOOD brush. These don&#x27;t last but, they are good for acrylic art because of the different sizes.</li>
    <li> NICE TO USE FOR NAILS...I LOVE IT....ITS VERY GOOD TO USE ON NAILS AND TOES....AND THE COLORS ARE FUN AS WILL.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my brushes! They&#x27;re exactly as described and they definitely do exactly what I need them to do!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use them with acrylic. They last through like one set, if that. I don&#x27;t know how you would use them for nail art, and if you can&#x27;t use them for acrylic they are pretty much worthless. For the price it was worth the try, but I mean literally I used them each once and that was all and they really only made it through one hand before they were all gunked up. They aren&#x27;t the hair acrylic brushes are supposed to be made of.</li>
    <li> Wonderful price for these acrylic brushes I use these to do my nails and I am very pleased</li>
    <li> I bought these and used them to do acrylic nails with my friend. They worked pretty good but the brushes were really stiff when they arrived. Also they took a while to arrive at my house. But they were cheap and worked well. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> they work well for what they are made for. The artificial nails go on good with these. Really good brushes</li>
    <li> good brushes and very affordable. I&#x27;m glad I din&#x27;t buy one for the price of these 5 in the local store.</li>
    <li> Good. Nice. Okay. Alright. As expected. In one piece. Nifty. Shiny. A-ok. Acceptable. Satisfactory. Valuable. Favorable. Neat. Pleasant. Agreeable. Commendable.</li>
    <li> definitely wasn&#x27;t what I expected at all. Seems to be false advertisement. Because brushes with definitely smaller than I expected</li>
    <li> My acrylic nail art uv gel carving pen brush arrived before time and in good condition and I am satisfied</li>
    <li> It works really good and I love it a lot. The little brush is perfect for acrylic bows and I also got it in three weeks.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been looking for acrylic brush,  and I couldn&#x27;t believe their price. I recheck again yup it sure was it. I purchase the brushes and wow they even ship it out asap. Got here sooner than they stated, and I really like the design on the brush plus the colors for. Each different sizes.</li>
    <li> Pretty average. They work great. I ave no problem with then. With the rainbow color it seems almost childlike. Nice product.</li>
    <li> I like the look and feel of these brushes, they&#x27;re very easy to work with, nice size variations, the handles are nice, the bristles have a good shape and they even have a cuticle pusher at the ends, BUT cheap is well cheap.&lt;br /&gt;I only got one use out of every brush because I had to keep switching brushes while doing my nails because the acrylic built up and hardened in the bristles and I could not get it out even after soaking, and resoaking in pure acetone, they still would not come clean, which basically rendered all 5 brushes useless after only one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, these are great for practice since they&#x27;re cheap and easily replaceable, but if you&#x27;re looking for quality brushes, I&#x27;d suggest looking else where.</li>
    <li> Brushes are much smaller than expected. Can’t work with such a small brush on acrylic tips. will not recommend this product to friends.</li>
    <li> if you want a good variety for less and you are a beginner I recommend this. Excellent for the price and when I get acrylic stuck in them (because I&#x27;m not too careful sometimes) I swirl them in acetone (from the 99cents store; haven&#x27;t tried pure acetone) it gets out and it doesn&#x27;t damage the brush. I just dry it ith a towel and shaping it to it&#x27;s original form and it looksl iek new again :).</li>
    <li> the brushes were ok until I was doing my acrylics and I went to go clean the brushes off and all the acrylic stayed in there the week before it was fine but this time no it wasn&#x27;t.. I&#x27;d prefer a free number 5 acrylic brush after getting this one.. and my blue one was also broken when I got it I super glued it back in the holder so not kool!!</li>
    <li> very poor quality i ended up throwing these away after one use will not order again not worth the money</li>
    <li> I do like these I just found a combo set with more brushes and the dotting tools that match for cheaper on a Ebay. I ordered the dotting tools as well to have a matching set they also work just disappointed that it was like almost 2 bucks more when I ordered both separately and that they had less brushes and tools for more money.</li>
    <li> my acrylic keeps getting stuck in between the brush hairs this brushes are not good do not get them ! i&#x27;ve wasted good money on brushes that i could only do two sets on ! there&#x27;s five brushes and i could only do two sets off of them !</li>
    <li> They are cheap, and are worthless after one use.</li>
    <li> I like it. Received 01/22/2015</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! I recently started doing my own acrylic nails and these brushes have an oval shape that gives the acrylic a smoother finish (the flat side is awesome) than round brushes. And they came a week early :) Oh...and they don&#x27;t shed</li>
    <li> Thought the brushes would be bigger but love them</li>
    <li> The bristles of the brush were much thinner than in the photo, I didn&#x27;t really like them.</li>
    <li> Awesome perfect to make acrylic nails</li>
    <li> I have not received these items yet. I am patiently waiting for them to arrive because I cannot wait to try them out.</li>
    <li> So I was looking for a brush to learn how to do nails.. One that wasn&#x27;t expensive incase I misused it.. I&#x27;d read the reviews and bought them anyway because they were a good price and you get 5 different sizes.. I was pleasantly surprised at how well they hold their shape! I had also bought a brush from my local Sally&#x27;s to compare and honestly I like these way more! Even when I get the acrylic in them pretty good, my bristles clean well ... I will buy again when these retire :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Mrs. H~</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes because I am always doing my nails. I would recommend these for anyone who likes to do their nails.</li>
    <li> Not good the bristles on brush fall off and come off when applying acrylic</li>
    <li> I like the fact that the product was very inexpensive. it came before it said it would and im totally going to be buying more from them</li>
    <li> I am in love with these super cute brushes! They look just as nice as in the photo, and feel firm, yet still bendable. Perfect for cleaning up nail polish or applying acrylic. I recommend these to anyone looking for a cute, inexpensive nail brush set.</li>
    <li> it was good but took a while which really bothered me</li>
    <li> Just received my products almost 2 weeks early. Very sturdy and easy to handle</li>
    <li> Lie them they work great</li>
    <li> I got my brushes very quick and they are just as described. I have used them once so far to do acrylic nails and they worked great and cleaned up very well and still look new. Will update to 5 stars if they hold up over time. Otherwise I&#x27;m very pleased with them.</li>
    <li> I like the brushes allot. I didn&#x27;t use them yet but they look like they would work well. so good..</li>
    <li> These are very nice brushes.</li>
    <li> I have only used the size eight brush so far, and this product has not let me down! I used it to apply acrylic to artificial nails and it came out great! For acrylic application these brushes are perfect. I have yet to use it for nail art, but I&#x27;m sure the smaller brush would be good. It takes about two weeks since the package is coming from China. It&#x27;s a good product! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> these are good brushes i just cant get used to it since i have been using my old brush for ever i keep practicing with these and hope i can get used to them</li>
    <li> I have really liked these brushes so far, many I have tried are very flimsy or the bristles don&#x27;t stay in but these are holding up great. Great price</li>
    <li> This brushes are great! If your a student, professional or diy nails, these brushes are worth it &amp; they are&#x27;nt a big loss if they get messed up. You have to treat them like any other nail brush and keep them clean. I am going to order another set.</li>
    <li> Received this item early! I&#x27;m excited to start my work with them!</li>
    <li> Brushes arrived broken and the ones that weren&#x27;t broken fell apart after 1 use</li>
    <li> Fast shipper, nice brushes. I personally like the smaller brushes when I do gel nails. Just perfect.</li>
    <li> Good item.Thank you for mailing it on time :)</li>
    <li> Ok so you get wat you pay... is beyond true here.  I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;ve been ripped off I paid very little for them,  the reviews when I was looking were terrific on these brushes with a few bad ones, so I gave it a shot.  I am here to say as a nail technician, keep scrolling!!!!!.  They were hard even after it was wet with acrylic, or my brush cleaner.  When it finally  became A slight bit flexible it fanned out in 10  different directions and has yet to reform... the bristles are still stiff and does NOT HOLD LIQUID, IT DOESN&#x27;T SPREAD ACRYLIC NICELY.  Etc but they are pretty&lt;br /&gt;Looking</li>
    <li> Great brushes for a great price</li>
    <li> Fast shipping / Great item! Very happy!</li>
    <li> I love them ...good quality</li>
    <li> Does a great job and arrived early which was a surprise! I would definitely buy these again</li>
    <li> Received earlier than expected. As descibed</li>
    <li> These did NOT work out well for me... They&#x27;re too stiff to even work with!</li>
    <li> Nice set of brushes. X&lt;br /&gt;X&lt;br /&gt;Xx x x x x x x x x x x x xx x</li>
    <li> Mail on time perfect:)★★★★★</li>
    <li> totally the cheapest and worst made item I have bought in a long time. After the first use, the bristles flared and then when I cleaned it they began to fall out! Don&#x27;t waste your money............BOO IN ALL AREAS!!!</li>
    <li> Not too bad. You have to constantly was them because they will get sticky but they do work well .</li>
    <li> got them for my granddaughter, soon as she opened them into her hair and nail room, said yes 2 thumbs up she recommends</li>
    <li> Im not a pro., i do my own at home but this work great for me for dirt cheap. Also they said to arrive july 21 to aug 5 and they got here july 10 so im a happy canper with this deal</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and early arrival.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I like these a lot! Great set. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it! Does what it has to. I like it</li>
    <li> These brushes aren&#x27;t expensive sable brushes the pros use but if you do acrylic nails at home they are an excellent value. I am not an expert at applying acrylic nails so I tend to ruin my brush by getting product deep in the bristles. I am getting better with practice. Still if I mess up one of these brushes it&#x27;s no big deal. It&#x27;s not like I paid $20 for one brush. These brushes are nice though. They are just fine to work with. I ordered two sets so I will have some back ups.</li>
    <li> i made the mistake of telling my wife she needed a hobby, well she found one in Nail Art.  She like the brushes so far, she has just gotten into this aspect of nail art so we&#x27;ll see.  The product is as described and was on time</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to do acrylic or gel nails so I got a set of these just incase I needed them. They shipped from Hong Kong and made it here before the date that I was given, which is a plus. One of the brushes was broken, but I was able to glue the brush back on the stick without any worries.</li>
    <li> I love doing my nails and getting this nail supply make it better both at home n in the nail salon. I love them and also they look cool to.</li>
    <li> First I received them about a week and a half earlier then expected....yay!  I&#x27;ve only used one so far and it worked out great.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, couldn&#x27;t give a full 5 stars just cuz I haven&#x27;t used all of them yet.  I recommend these for any nail art novice &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> After the 1st use of the brush.... cleaning was a disaster. The acrylic remained in the brush. When I tried to clean same, the bristles began falling out. After that one cleaning the brush was no more!</li>
    <li> It was what I expected</li>
    <li> Great set of starter brushes.</li>
    <li> Great delivery, good quality.</li>
    <li> Thank you for my brush</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. They are strong and very pretty.</li>
    <li> HAVENT USED THEM YET. TOOK AWHILE TO GET TO ME BUT I THINKT HEY CAME FROM HONG KONG OR SOMETHING/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD PACKAGEING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD SIZE. LOOKS LIKE THEY WILL DO WHAT I NEED THEM TO. GOOD VARIETY OF SIZES.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to do my own acrylic nails and love them.  They arrive faster than anticipated and were actually better than I expected.  I thought I would be happy to get to use them a few times but these will be with my for a while!</li>
    <li> These arrived fairly fast and at least two weeks before the expected arrival date. I haven&#x27;t used these yet but the colors that are in the picture are different than the ones I received, along with the sizes. Instead of a number 2 brush in the package, I received a number 12. The colors I received were dark blue, white, soft pink, purple and yellow. They seem nice, can&#x27;t wait to try them!</li>
    <li> I bought those for Acrylic powder practice entry level. Product is just so so, not meet for my expectation. Fast shipping . Thanks</li>
    <li> gooood price, looks good, ready to try them out in a few days. so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these for sure.</li>
    <li> I got them yesterday they came before the estimated arrival although they look pretty much like the picture they are a lot smaller than I thought they would be and the size 6 brush fell apart upon taking it from the package the top of the brush came off! a little glue will fix that so overall I gave them a four mostly because of the shipping.</li>
    <li> When i tried to use it i did not like it and i stopped and clean it up and put it back to the plastic bag and i kept it. maybe i can use it for other things.</li>
    <li> These work great for doing acrylic nails on people with small nail beds and fingers.</li>
    <li> Firstly it came on time I was happy when it arrived but after using these brushes they are a waste of your money and your time so dont even waste your time looking at them. After the first use the brushes started to come out and sti k together I just had to threw it away.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes! Exactly like picture! On time delivery ♡</li>
    <li> These are great for working acrylic onto your nails. The smaller ones are also great for applying make up as well as doing nail art designs. For this price i will be buying more.</li>
    <li> I just got these brushes in the mail.  They are really pretty.  I&#x27;m going to use them to paint detail on fondant flowers so I needed small detail brushes.  They do have very nice pointy tips.  I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but I think they will work nicely.</li>
    <li> Bristles were not as tightly packed which made them a bit more flexible for my preference.</li>
    <li> Planing to buy more there are good and  love that price</li>
    <li> I have used 3 of the brushes so far and they have all lost ALOT of bristles.  I love the sizes and how they look, just not a long life span for the,  I got 2 sets of nails out of each and they needed to be thrown away.  Just my experience, maybe I just got a bad batch.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t shed.  They hold their shape.  Easy to grip.  Good choice of sizes.  I recommend these highly. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> The brushes are quality brushes, well made and easy to use with nail acrylic. I like the colors and was very happy to receive them so quickly.</li>
    <li> im actually suprised at how well they work i just started doing acrylic ontop of my real nail using the sticker forms and they do the job great esp bc theyre are 5 diff sizes the shipping was about 2 weeks maybe even less so i loved that deff reccomend to anyone!</li>
    <li> bought this for a friend she loved it, and she got exactly what was advertise on the picture, thanks happy customer</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t work for acrylic looks like plastic bristles !</li>
    <li> Brushes are ok, but I didn&#x27;t like how thy worked using acrylic powder. I wasn&#x27;t too happy but customer service was great in correcting the issue!! Thank you</li>
    <li> The brush set it cool and nicce,they work greatt on acrylic nails,and the best is that they dont cost a lot</li>
    <li> I love it i uses this to do 3D nail art w acrilic and i love that they have diferent zises amd good quality of product</li>
    <li> I bought these because I have started to do 3D nail art and didnt want to spend a lot of money on getting different size brushed. The came in about 3 weeks &amp; no damage when they arrived. I love that they have the size of the brush on the side, they are color coded which make it easier to pick the one you need, and no issues with the bristles. Great buy for the price point.</li>
    <li> For the price it is a great buy. A whole lot better than spending 20+ dollars on other brushes. They don&#x27;t seem to last as long but for the price I will buy multiple packs</li>
    <li> Their amazingly sturdy, and are great to work with! Amazing deal I love them and will definetly be purchasing more soon (:</li>
    <li> 350buy 5pcs Acrylic Nail Art UV Gel Carving Pen Brush Liquid Powder... . arrived on time have not used them yet . purchases from another retailer have not come in yet</li>
    <li> whenever i use these my clients are always mesmerized by the swirls inside and they do a fabulous job! love them</li>
    <li> These r some of thee best brushes I use for multi usage. More focusing on acrylic paints and nail designs</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes because I work a lot with gel and nail art. I have not use them as of yet but they feel nice and fit nice in the hand.  I have other brushes that cost more that don&#x27;t feel as nice in hand.  I am sure they will work well with gel and acrylic paints.</li>
    <li> They are nice n easy to use but they have to be clean properly if not they will get messed up already got 2 more sets for back up.</li>
    <li> The brushes bend WAY too easily...Get more worth while brushes...NOT THESE! I can&#x27;t even use them... Buy more pro brushes...</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the timely manor my packaged was received. Luv the quality of the brushes the different selection of sizes that is included.</li>
    <li> I bought this set to do acrylic nails at home. is a great product  the brushes have a good quality and you get all the sizes you need&lt;br /&gt;to start doing nails.  also I bought 1 brush at the beauty supply and the shipest one was over 5 dollars, so for the same price you get 5 brushes here.</li>
    <li> I had just bought the carving pens and the part that puts the stick and the brush together BROKE ALMOST IMMEDIATLY</li>
    <li> Brushes were bent n nt good quality don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order from them again. After cleaning them they were still bent out of shape</li>
    <li> These are not good for beginners in acrylics. The acrylic got stuck in the bristles and all of them got ruined. I suggest that you get a more expensive brush somethings just need to be done right and this is one of them. They were cheaply made some of the heads would pop off and that wasnt good at all. Hoppefully you guys have better experiences with this product.</li>
    <li> Good product. They work great for 3d art or for just applying acrylic. U must soak the brushes in acetone first before use because the dye on the hair will turn ur acrylic a red/orange tint. Other than that great product!</li>
    <li> they work good, BUT you need to dip in lacquer thinner after EVERY NAIL, or the acrylic will harden on the brush and its virtually IMPOSSIBLE to ever clean it off, and if u do get it off, the brush is so damaged and messed up that you cant use it, so USE LACQUER THINNER AFTER EVERY NAIL!
