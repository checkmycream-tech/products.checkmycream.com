<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> JUST ONE WORD, FANTASTIC. I LOVE</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about this.  It is the best shampoo I have ever used in my life!</li>
    <li> great shampoo i do love it moisturize and clean my hair leave it smooth and healthy i do recommend it</li>
    <li> Its my second bottle! This really works for my frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice project. I recommend it. Although I have found other products at work as well and less expensive</li>
    <li> It is a very good shampoo that help your hair although It is not a miracle.</li>
    <li> Works perfect with my 4B natural hair and my daughters 3B hair. This shampoo works well with detangling natural hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product...I&#x27;ve been using It&#x27;s A 10 products for a couple of years now... However, this was poorly package (wrapped loosely in bubble wrap with no tape around it or the cap) So, needless to say upon opening the box, the shampoo had opened and spilled out, everywhere!!!! I also ordered the conditioner which also was shipped in the same box but was in sealed plastic. Two bottle shipped in a medium size box with no packing material in it. So, now I have a full bottle of conditioner and only a half bottle of shampoo and a mess to clean up!!!!</li>
    <li> Worth the money. My hair is fuller and much more healthy. Would buy again.  Good value for the size. I use it 2-3 times a week.</li>
    <li> My daughter has beautiful long thick auburn hair. This product with conditioner makes it shiny clean and less frizzy</li>
    <li> Great product, good price, and fast shipping. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love it.  I didnt notice a difference until after I used this shampoo ( with conditioner &amp; leave in treatment) for about 3-4 times.  My hair doesn&#x27;t break &amp; holds up to the heat tools I use.  I love the results.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my color treated hair. I have the leave-in spray which I LOVE, so I had high hopes. But this shampoo is just not good at all...it left a dry film in my hair and my hair was just an aweful dry  tangled mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have bought a smaller bottle to test with because now I have $40 worth of shampoo I just can&#x27;t use!</li>
    <li> A great shampoo that adds body and the right kind of oil.  It is not heavy or flattening.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> Works well, hair is clean and not full of stuff, works well in conjunction with the conditioner</li>
    <li> Lightning fast delivery, product as described, great value! Thank you &amp;#34;Beauty It Is&amp;#34;! Will buy again in the future. :)</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! I have their conditioner as well. Great combo!</li>
    <li> i love this product!!!  I have long hair and it gets frizzy with humidity.  this shampoo tackles this problem provided you blow dry afterward.  Leaves hair shiny and it smells great too.  What could be better?</li>
    <li> Great shampoo love the way it makes my hair feel!</li>
    <li> What can I say more when she really loves it?</li>
    <li> This is a great product, and it was shipped super fast. Its the same quality as the small presentation.</li>
    <li> I switched to It&#x27;s A 10 for Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Awapui Shampoo and Conditioner.  Prices are about the same but I like It&#x27;s A 10 much better than the Paul Mitchell.</li>
    <li> I have middle eastern dyed hair  , curly and frizzy. I was looking for keratine treatment on amazon and stumbled upon this product. I was so happy reading the review so I decided to buy the shampoo and leave-in conditioner. Disappointing. I didn&#x27;t like it from the first time using. it just made my hair dry, unshiny, the frizz still there. I&#x27;ve been using it for month hoping I can see a result over the time but still there is no progress I can see on my hair. PLEASE don&#x27;t get hyped reading the reviews, there is no such a miracle.</li>
    <li> I get regular keratin treatments to my baby fine, somewhat thin hair, and pay a fortune.  This shampoo does not strip that, yet still cleans my hair.  Yea!</li>
    <li> The shampoo really does make dry frizzy hair easier to manage.  The only reason I give it 3 stars is the strong fragrant smell.  While the smell isn&#x27;t a bad smell, it is very overpowering and it was hard for me to get used to smelling such strong hair product in my hair. I felt like others were going to notice it as well.  Because it is sulfate free, my hair began to take on an \\&quot;oily\\&quot; smell in addition to the shampoo smell after a couple of weeks of use.  I believe my scalp is releasing more oil and because the shampoo is sulfate free, it isn&#x27;t clearing out the oil like most other sulfate based shampoos.  It isn&#x27;t a bad smell, it just smelled like I had been in the hot sun all day.  It does what it says it will do, if you can tolerate the strong smell!  It takes getting used to.</li>
    <li> Magically improves the elasticity and strength of my hair. One of the VERY FEW beauty products that does what it says it will do!</li>
    <li> I purchased the shampoo, conditioner and leave in conditioner spray.  I use them daily. They work wonderfully for my long hair, which I have colored regularly.  I would certainly recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> It is a good shampoo, but expensive and I think there is just as good shampoos out there---I was a little disappointed</li>
    <li> really makes a difference on even heavily damaged hair</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for four weeks and within this amount of time this  product has made my hair healthy for the first time in years!  My hair looks and feels great!</li>
    <li> I always had long, healthy, and shiny dark hair.  For the last few years, ever since I stopped breast feeding, I noticed my hair started to change.  I&#x27;ve tried many different products, and after two weeks of using Its A Miracle 10 Shampoo with Keratin I saw and felt a noticeable difference in my hair.  I see about 90% less breakage on the floor when drying my hair, the strands feel stronger and thicker giving me fuller, smoother hair.  This blows away Pureology!!  It has a nice mild fragrance.  I have straight, fine hair and it does not weigh my hair down.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo but it leaked because lid was not screwed on tight, so I did not get the full product</li>
    <li> Awesome shampoo and helping to repair over processed hair, but takes a minute to get use to not so much lather!</li>
    <li> I do not see a difference in my hair. It does the same thing as the cheaper brands. My hair is still as frizzy as it was before I spent all this money. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I love the miracle shampoo. My hair is dry and needs the extra TLC so I discovered this after a recent visit with my hair stylist...she recomended this product so I gave it a try..needless to say I love the way it makes my hair feel :)</li>
    <li> Love it!  My hair feels great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always taken my thick smooth hair for granted.  Once it started turning gray, my hair texture has become&lt;br /&gt;dry, wiry, and frizzy in humid weather.  I&#x27;ve tried many different shampoos, conditioners, and hair serums, but&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any appreciable improvement.  After reading reviews of this shampoo, I decided to take a chance&lt;br /&gt;on it.  My hair is definitely softer and more manageable now.  I still have slightly frizzy hair but it&#x27;s a big difference from&lt;br /&gt;a couple of months ago.  I also added the &amp;#34;10 Miracle Deep Conditioner Plus Keratin&amp;#34; to my hair routine, and the two&lt;br /&gt;products combined have noticeable calmed my unruly grays.  Even with my thick hair, I have to be careful to use only a&lt;br /&gt;small amount of conditioner or it tends to weigh my hair down.</li>
    <li> I wrote a review for the conditioner...love the shampoo as well.  Great for thick, wavy and frizzy hair. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I truly do. Maybe it&#x27;s because my hair is longer (16 in approximately) but I feel like I have to use a ton of the product to really saturate my hair. I&#x27;ve used it twice now and I have about a half a bottle left. Having said that, it does make my hair incredibly manageable. I have coarse, naturally wavy /curly /frizzy hair. I combine this with the conditioner and leave in treatment and my hair is soft after blow drying. I do find that my ends feel a little... Waxy after I blow dry..? But that&#x27;s OK since I use heat tools and maybe it&#x27;s extra protection. All in all I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Totally controls wavy frizzy hair in the straightening process. Leaves a beautiful shine and smells amazing. You will never use another product.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, after using this product, with using no straightening irons or damaging heat styling tools, my hair had more breakage and dryness than it did originally. It was reducing my natural curls and at times made my scalp itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freaked out and wondering what was going on with my hair, I decided to check into the ingredients of the product. I discovered that this product contains Carboxaldehyde. To put it simply, Carboxaldehyde is Formaldehyde with a pleasant odor. WOW - I read that the presence of Formaldehyde is common with Keratin containing products!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it contains:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Methylchloroisothiazolinone is a Human skin toxicant and is also linked to cancer. A human skin toxicant that I am supposed to put on my head???!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Methylisothiazolinone is a widely-used preservative; has been associated with allergic reactions. Lab studies on the brain cells of mammals also suggest that methylisothiazolinone may be neurotoxic?! Again --- neurotoxic and I&#x27;m putting it on my head and hair????!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, no wonder I was having problems - NO THANKS! :(</li>
    <li> My hair turned out like a dry rat&#x27;s nest.  I am going back to using WEN products. Trying new products is costly.  Stick with what you know works</li>
    <li> my favorite hair product ever!!!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this shampoo.  I have tried several sulphate-free shampoos including the more expensive Pureology and this is my favorite by far.  It is very moisturizing and leaves my hair feel soft and clean.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for your hair</li>
    <li> Great Stuff/Great Price!!!</li>
    <li> This has made a big difference in my hair!!!</li>
    <li> My mom is a hair dresser, but since I&#x27;ve move to the west coast I haven&#x27;t really asked her for any products because it&#x27;s not cost and time efficient once she ships it to me. In saying this, I have used TONS of different shampoos, conditioners, leave-in treatments, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today was my first day using the Keratin shampoo and conditioner.  I also used the regular Miracle leave-in.  The shampoo feels different from other shampoos I&#x27;ve used, and when I was washing it out I was worried I would be left with oily residue in my hair since my scalp is extremely oil.  Of course I figured I might as well see this through with the conditioner since I already invested a lot of money into a shampoo and conditioner.  When I got out of the shower and towel dried my hair it felt much more moist than usual, but not weight down.  It actually felt like it had a bit more volume to it, which I was very surprised by.  My hair is very straight; ot fine or thick, just normal; does not hold any styles; is colored, and has been permed before; I have a very oily scalp; and becuase of all the blow drying and heat styling my hair is a bit fried.  I went to the hair dresser last to have my hair cut and she mentioned how damaged my hair was on the ends (not by my scalp because of how oily it is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I sprayed in the leave in conditioner and combed my hair as instructed on the bottle.  I let it sit in a towel to dry a bit more, and then I blew dry my hair just like normal.  Wow...what a difference this stuff makes! Usually as I blow dry my hair I know that the ends are dry becuase I can see the texture of them become very dry (straw-like...not dry in a good way).  This time my hair remained very soft.  I had to keep checking that it was dry becuase it did not turn dry/straw-like even though it was dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my morning routine was complete I was so excited about how my hair looked.  It wasn&#x27;t weighed down (which was my biggest fear), it wasn&#x27;t oily at the scalp--instead it was light weight and very shiny and healthy looking.  This is the best my  hair has looked and felt in years!!! I hope that everyone discovers the It&#x27;s a 10 line and enjoys it as much as I do.nstead it was light weight and very shiny and healthy looking.  This is the best my  hair has looked and felt in years!!! I hope that everyone discovers the It&#x27;s a 10 line and enjoys it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Great price😂</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and the conditioner with keratin.  It takes several uses, as in two weeks worth, to see a real difference, but I promise you, you will.  Best shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried in years.</li>
    <li> Not only does this product smell great and leave your hair feeling super silky and healthy; but this product has none of the harsh chemicals that other brands have in them. I absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  In a short period my hair has transformed to a very healthy texture and appearance.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> LOVE &#x27;its a 10&#x27; products!!...highly recommended :)</li>
    <li> love this product, love the feel of my hair after using it</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!!!  I use the shampoo and the conditioner, then put on the Miracle oil with keratin also made by same company.  Hair is very soft and managable.  With all the products, a litle goes a long way, so it will last you quite a while.  My hair is medium length</li>
    <li> This Shampoo is outstanding!  My hair has never looked so good our felt so soft! This is a nice and thick shampoo that works into a healthy lather while washing hair. When complete, after brushing my hair, I leave far less broken strands in the sink or in the brush. Try this shampoo...you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> How to make your hair feel like pure silk, healthy and silky - start with the shampoo and continue with ALL It&#x27;s a 10 products.  Awesome line of hair products!</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE It&#x27;s a 10 products and so I tried the shampoo and it&#x27;s amazing too!  You only need a little and my hair is much healthier!  It&#x27;s definitely worth the cost!</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo. It works great for thick hair and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a residue like so many others.</li>
    <li> After shopping around at many beauty supply stores and big box stores I found that Amazon had this large bottle for MUCH cheaper than the stores.  Even with a coupon and a sale at a normal store, this beats them even if you pay next day shipping.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a 10 products are the best around!!!My hair is shiny, manageable. has never been in better shape.I can not say enough good things about it.</li>
    <li> Ordered 38 ounce size but only received 17 ounce size. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Purchase this product for my daughter since she believes her hair has to be straight. It helps keeping hair from frizzing.</li>
    <li> Best product ever for natural hair (Locs); I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now.  Had to pass along my first bottle to my daughter and grand daughters.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes hair feel soft and silky with no frizz! Lots of luster and bounce in my hair now !</li>
    <li> LOVE this shampoo!!!  I can actually go for two days between shampoos ... Absolutely unheard of with my thin hair!!  Usually I need to wash it every day for bounce and shine.  With this shampoo and product line, I can go every other day (sometimes longer) between shampoos!!  AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> I had dramatic hair loss following surgery--and what hair I had left was very thin and frizzy.  My cousin let me use her It&#x27;s a 10 conditioner and it was wonderful!  Hair is still thin--but is soft, manageable, and new hair is growing back!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.Purchased for my wife who likes the product very much. Excellent price for large quantity of contents.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. This product does not dry my hair out.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo on accident. It is very harsh on my baby fine hair, and my hair has started breaking off in just a few weeks. It smells great and lathers nicely but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for fine hair. I use the moisture shampoo and definately recommend it over this product for fine hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product line. And I think it makes my hair smell great, I don&#x27;t find the smell offensive at all.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo there is! My hair was black and in order to get it back to brown I had to do a Bleach wash. This made my hair extremely dry. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a few weeks and my hair is back to being soft, shiny and manageable. And I saved tons of money buying this shampoo of amazon! I pump is all you need, so this large size will last me for quite a while.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Save my hair for a few years now. However it&#x27;s getting more and more expensive so I&#x27;m switching to macadamia products and see which one is more compatible to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last time it didn&#x27;t ship overseas but now it does.</li>
    <li> Jury is still out, hairdresser recommended and I&#x27;m not sold as of yet.</li>
    <li> This is my first bottle although I have been using the Miracle Mask for quite sometime.  This shampoo is very rich at an affordable price.  I have been a Kerastase fan in the past but feel this product is just as good and at a fraction of the cost.  Is does not have as strong of a scent as Kerastase so that maybe be good or bad depending on your preference.</li>
    <li> My 11 year daughter loves this.No tangles since using this shampoo. She doesnt even need to brush her hair. Miracle!!!</li>
    <li> I have very dry, brittle, damaged hair from a thyroid condition, living in the TX weather, and being colored.  This product has been amazing and I can do days without washing my hair and it is still like the day I washed it.  LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> This shampoo certainly compliments the leave in conitioner that we already use. It is very rich therefore you do not a much when using it</li>
    <li> Great on my hair. I have coarse, thick hair and this is a great product. This is a great product</li>
    <li> This shampoo &amp; the deep conditioner have changed my hair in less than 2 weeks.  My hair is fine &amp; curly ...... I blow it out &amp; straighten it most of the time.  this normally leaves my ends dry &amp; unhealthy looking.  I made an app to get my hair trimmed because it looked so bad.  In the meantime, I bought the shampoo &amp; conditioner &amp; after 2 washes my ends no longer looked or felt dry.  other than it being uneven, my ends to no appear to be split!!  my hair looks great &amp; so i rescheduled my hair app to get it cut in a month from now. it honestly looks as though I got the dry stuff cut off the ends of my hair.  After a few uses of the shampoo &amp; cond, I purchased the leave-in, which I love as well.  I always use salon-grade products but nothing has really impressed me like this has.  I won&#x27;t be using anything else from now on.  Also, the shampoo is sulfate free but unlike any other i&#x27;ve used.  it lathers REALLY well &amp; you only need a tiny bit, even though I only wash my hair every 2 - 3 days.  Usually it&#x27;s the shampoo I use a lot of, &amp; less conditioner but with this stuff, I need less shampoo &amp; more conditioner.  the conditioner is very thick &amp; works well but I end up using a lot of it.</li>
    <li> My hair became dry as I age.  (I am over 50)  I use this with conditioner w/keratin in the series.  I now like my hair, having softness and shine back!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like it. After a while it had a funky smell. went straight to the garbage. oh well.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo! Will only use this! Making my unhealthy hair: healthy!! Smells great as well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for sometime and I am pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;It was recommended by my stylist since I started using it my hair&lt;br /&gt;feel very smooth and not heavy at all.</li>
    <li> A little expensive, but it really helps my thin, otherwise lifeless flat blond hair. My hair dresser even commented at my last appt that my hair seemed much healthier! I blow dry my hair every day to get volume, and then curl it- this product helps a lot!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t dry my hair as I have it coloured every 8 weeks.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works very well. It doesn&#x27;t contain harsh sulfates, so it feels really gentle on the hair. However, it does impart the keratin to help restore the damage from my bleaching.</li>
    <li> Expensive but worth it.  I have thick, dry course hair and this stuff makes it silky smooth when used with the conditioner. Even without conditioner, it leaves hair smooth after rinsing.  I have shine too!  Wish was a little cheaper but this is a BIG bottle so should last me quite a while.</li>
    <li> The large bottle is not the same stuff has the small bottle from home town beauty shop.? Would love to return this product. Never again will i buy Shampoo from this site.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about this product.  I use it with the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 miracle deep conditioner plus keratin&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave-in plus keratin&amp;#34; and I refuse to use anything else on my hair.  A little goes a long way with all of the products.  I have thick, long hair, and I only use 1.5 pumps of shampoo and 2 pumps of conditioner.  My hair has never been so healthy and easy to manage.  It is worth every penny!  I definitely suggest using the set since they all do different things.  The shampoo cleans and cleanses, the conditioner rehydrates and restores, and the leave in locks in moisture and protects from styling and UV rays.  Once you try this you will love how your hair feels and the manageability, you won&#x27;t want anything else!</li>
    <li> I have wavy unmanageable hair and this shampoo makes my hair silky and smooth. Love it and will not use anything else.</li>
    <li> Fantastic shampoo for colored hair.  Color doesn&#x27;t fade.  Texture of hair is soft and shiny..</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  Using it for 1 year I have curly hair &amp; live in Houston it really helps control the frizz.  I color my hair the 10 line of products keeps my hair soft &amp; shiny.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever. Smells great. I have super fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it greasy. I also use it on my two year old. I am always getting compliments  on how beautiful her hair looks and smells. Best value for the liter. For reference,  a 10 oz bottle at target is around $22</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel awsome</li>
    <li> It is actually a great working shampoo and does what it says…but at the cost of using a cancer causing ingredient.

    <li> I jus love this product! My hair smile, look and feel good! I will continue to purchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vivian</li>
    <li> I have dry hair.  I give this shampoo a 10.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this shampoo! I have very fine hair and this has really helped get it back into shape. Smells very nice, too. Highly recommend this seller as I had my order within 7 days of ordering! Decent price for this product, too. Will definitely purchase from here again! Thank you!</li>
    <li> i have keratin treated hair and use this to wash my hair.. it leaves it so moisturized, i have no need to put in any conditioner.. i just use the miracle 10 leave in..</li>
    <li> This is great and helps repair damage from color or heat damage!</li>
    <li> This was an amazing deal, considering you pay this much for a small bottle in the store!! This is a must-have shampoo to save the life of your hair!</li>
    <li> I luv It&#x27;s a 10 products.  Expensive, but has saved my permed + colored hair!  Other people have written about other products, but none compare pricewise.  If it&#x27;s 3x the price, it BETTER be better.  If u can find anything else that works as well for this price, I&#x27;d like to know!</li>
    <li> Shampoo is just as good as the conditioner.  It&#x27;s A 10 the best product I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  It makes my hair super soft!</li>
    <li> I have tried many shampoos and this one is amazing! It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stringy and dry like a lot of other shampoos I have used. I have been using this for about a month. I can notice a difference. My hair is more manageable, and doesn&#x27;t feel like its brittle like it used to. I formally used Bed Head shampoo and conditioner, which was great, but I will now use this! I plan on reordering whenever this bottle runs out (which will not be for quite a while)! It smells good too (not fruity like some others)!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!! It makes my hair clean smelling, easy to manage, and last for days. I recommend this product to other. I will order more from Amazon!!</li>
    <li> only need a small amount, lathers easily, not sure if it works for helping to reduce hair breakage, but since it has all those good qualities that the bottle says i guess thats a plus. used it on my newly blonde hair that has breakage, hair still shedding but will continue to use product because i prefer this less harsh product and will continue to use the full line of its a 10.</li>
    <li> I love this, best on the market</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Hair feels so muh better and just feels cleaner.</li>
    <li> MY DAUGHTER RECOMMENDED IT&amp;#62; I NOTICED A DIFERENCE THE FIRST TIME I TRIED IT&amp;#62; MY HAIR FELT SILKIER AND CLEANER!</li>
    <li> This product is certainly healthier for your hair than many store brand products considering the ingredients (such as lack of harsh detergents). However, don&#x27;t expect it to work any miracles. It&#x27;s just shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Makes your hair feel amazing. One of the best products on the market. It&#x27;s a 10 knows what they are doing.</li>
    <li> Avoid expensive salon treatments..... Get beautiful results with this It&#x27;s A 10 line of products.  Each product  in this line always delivers.</li>
    <li> This product came recommended by my hair stylist, but not sure yet if i am in love with it. It does not spread onto the hair as easily as I would like so I am still trying to find the right combo of water and product to work it in. Cant tell just yet if it makes a difference in the outcome of my hair either. but I will give it a few more washings....jury still out.</li>
    <li> I have the its a 10 hair mask and love it so I thought that I would try their shampoo and I hate it.  It leaves my hair very tangly and dry.</li>
    <li> My hair even shows some natural curl now and feels thicker</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. My hair has been very healthy looking. Will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair feel amazing. I use it with the conditioner and the leave in conditioner. I have noticed a dramatic change in the texture and look of my hair</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  I have red tinted hair and my hair doesn&#x27;t fade nearly as much plus it feels much thicker.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed, I guess I was expecting a &amp;#34;Miracle &amp;#34; . My hair doesn&#x27;t look that much better. I&#x27;m hoping with repeated use it will get better.</li>
    <li> highlighted blonde, in the desert &#x3D; fried hair.  Love this stuff!!!  Sometimes it takes a little more water to get it to lather up really good.  It&#x27;s really thick, so it takes a while to pump out the top of the dispenser.  I think I would prefer a cap with a whole in it so that when it gets low you can tip it upside down.  But the shampoo is amazing!</li>
    <li> Is it toxic its an emergency please help me</li>
    <li> its a 10 Miracle Shampoo plus Keratin is the best shampoo on the market. It leave dry damaged hair soft to the touch. Its the best shampoo I ever tried in my life. My dry, damaged, stripped, hair is now silky-soft, manageable, shiny and easy to comb with less frizz. The shampoo alone feels like a conditioner. Its sulphate free!!!! Its the best shampoo ever!!!! I love this shampoo. I saw a difference in my hair after the first wash. I stocked up on it so I will never run out of it. Amazon is the best place to purchase Its a 10 Products. You get it a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any specifics but my wife loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I have been using the It&#x27;s A 10 Leave In Conditioner for years. I rave about the leave in and the shampoo/conditioner works just as well. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and I think it makes my hair \\&quot;feel better\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t use this daily... only when I&#x27;m planning on blow drying and straightening and/or once a week in the summer (Sundays, usually) for a special little treatment to make up for all the damage it goes through at the beach and in the sun. The actual product itself would get 5+ stars from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I gave this great product 3 stars is the bottle design. I hate the pump top for shampoo and conditioners because I feel like I will end up wasting some product in the end... when products are as expensive as this, that isn&#x27;t something I am too thrilled about. In addition to wasting, the pump lid makes storage much more awkward. I can&#x27;t exactly throw this in my box of hair products because it would go all over the place! I have to store this upright in my bathroom and since it&#x27;s such a weird shape anyway, it takes up a bit of room. I prefer flip top lids for shampoo/conditioner because I feel I get the most product usage and they&#x27;re more practical for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I have a problem with the bottle itself, I won&#x27;t let that stop me from reordering this great product when the time comes.</li>
