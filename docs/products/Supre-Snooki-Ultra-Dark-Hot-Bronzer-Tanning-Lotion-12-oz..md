<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It is very hot, and will turn you red. But.. that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do! I love this lotion because after all the red goes away, I&#x27;m a very golden brown color. Not orange. This lotion also smells very good before the tanning bed and after.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tanned religiously for the last 5 years and I HATED IT!!! Felt like my skin was on fire immediately after applying.  I had to jump in a cold shower and remove immediately.  I&#x27;m going back to J-Wow!</li>
    <li> Hot burning feeling is not tingly it is a rash. I love the smell but not the way it feels.</li>
    <li> Used this lotion in a sample size today, the tingle was great but not overpowering! Great fresh smell, no \\&quot;funky\\&quot; after tanning smell, and really brings color out. I&#x27;m definitely considering purchasing a full size bottle!</li>
    <li> I purchased several samples at my salon and loved it. Didn&#x27;t want to pay 85 so I ordered from here. I have used it 5 times and no color. I bought another sample at my salon since it was on sale and it worked so it must be this bottle. The sample packs leave me red for about an hr and this bottle doesn&#x27;t even leave me pink.</li>
    <li> Wow! Ordered product on a Saturday and received order by Tuesday! Extremely impressed with processing time and with product! Even came with a free sample Kardashian Tan Extender! Will definitely purchase again! Thanks for a great product and great customer service!</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion it gets you dark and it smells good. Everybody should buy it :) Buy it NOW :)</li>
    <li> Heard a lot of hype about this lotion &amp; decided it was something I needed to have!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a religious TINGLE user &amp; to me, this was a rather HOT tingle.&lt;br /&gt;I had been using Modern Bombshell 300xxx Sizzle but to be honest, (to me), the Snooki seemed a few notches hotter!!!&lt;br /&gt;&amp; I absolutely LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is amazing! Kinda reminds me of those Strawberry cream-saver candies... or Strawberries &amp; Champagne from Bath &amp; Body Works.&lt;br /&gt;This is DEFINITELY NOT for beginning tanners!! I looked like a lobster when I came out of the booth.&lt;br /&gt;On a scale of 1-10 with the tingle, I&#x27;d give it a big, fat 10!! Haha!! But a good 10!!&lt;br /&gt;The redness didn&#x27;t last very long. I noticed it had started to go in within an hour of tanning.&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t much of an after-tan odor that I notice. To me, my skin smells like what the lotion smells like when it goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to experienced tanners or tanners that are looking for a hot tingle. OR for tanners that have reached that \\&quot;tanning plateau\\&quot;. The bottle says it contains DHA &amp; Henna. &amp; the DHA is supposed to continue the bronzers development hours after tanning. I HAVE noticed a difference in the \\&quot;bronzed-ness\\&quot; of my skin after using this only once. I noticed the bronze color coming out about 3 hours after tanning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy this lotion &amp; will definitely be buying again when I run out of this bottle!!!</li>
    <li> This product is best I&#x27;ve ever used! My skin is a beautiful healthy looking shade and incredibly soft! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Left HUGE polka dot rashes all over my body, especially stomach area. Turned red which is expected, but after the redness was gone, NO  color except polka dots remained that took almost a week to go away. Def go with Pauly D&#x27;s after party!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I have sensitive skin but after putting this on my arms, after a couple hours it was like they were on fire. The itching was so so awful. Thr smell was nice but sadly I&#x27;ll have to throw it away:(</li>
    <li> I used to use bombshell for the past 9 yrs until now. I have to admit I was worried this lotion may not work and just sells due to the \\&quot;Snooki\\&quot; name but boy was I wrong! Today was my first day using it after a year of not tanning-- my children have been telling me I am so pale that I look as if I am a vampire lol now thats pale! So I decided to use my Snooki lotion today and start getting some color. OMG at first it shocked me... it actually smells really good! I even got compliments on how I smelled after :) second, I thought it would be really orangish brown and turn my hands color when putting it on and nothing!!! Goes on transparently. Finally I only tanned for about 7 minutes and felt the same effect I would have with Bombshell after 15!!! It is about 5 hours after tanning and showering now and my red color is actually turning tan! yayyy! Plus I would like to mention this lotion did not itch or burn me anything like Bombshell did while and right after tanning. Excellent lotion!!!!!!! I will only be using this brand from now on :)</li>
    <li> This is a good tingler!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for beginner tanners.  If you are looking for a boost in your tan this is perfect.</li>
    <li> As quick as I could apply the lotion my face and arms burned and got instantly bright red. I didn&#x27;t even have time to tan and I was jumping in a cold shower to wash it off! Even after washing it off immediately I was left with red blotches and burning skin. I like to enjoy my tanning not feel like hell!!</li>
    <li> Snooki and super have out done themselves!!! The color I get is great, it&#x27;s a perfectly golden brown tingle. However not for the inexperienced tanner!!!!!</li>
    <li> I used a sample size of this just the other day and just had to buy it.  I could not believe how great it is.  The tingle is the perfect amount and my husband said I smelled wonderful when I got back home.  Very great product.  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> It is AMAZING! It has a DHA bronzes in it but I am glad that didn&#x27;t get stop me from getting it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I have tried other tingles with bronzers and they all have either turned me HOARANGE (hoar+orange) or they didn&#x27;t do anything for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried modern bombshell and don&#x27;t even bother with that unless you like hoarange!!! I have also tried pink diamond and that 1.didn&#x27;t tingle or get hot 2. Didn&#x27;t tan me I looked the same going into the bed as I did the next day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried cinna bronze and I LOVED it I rave about these two over and over again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither cinna bronze and snooki ultra hot bronzer streaked me or left me orange!!! They got me bronze and dark they both smell AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***cinna bronze doesn&#x27;t get as hot as this lotion***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!!!*** I am not being paid and/or endorsed by either company&#x27;s***!!!</li>
    <li> Made my skin feel smooth and helped me get the tan I wanted in the winter time! I would highly recommend this tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> I tan very often and use a lot of different lotions. I tested this one on a small part of my arm when I got it and ten minutes later my arm was one huge hive! I don&#x27;t have any allergies that I know of. I recommend testing a small part of your hand/arm before going to the salon! I would&#x27;ve been one huge burning itchy hive had I not tested it beforehand.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is AMAZING!!! I love everything about it. It smells fabulous. The bottle is just as adorable in person as it is in pictures. The tanning effect that I have got from this product is great. I do not get an orange tint to myself at all, it&#x27;s a beautiful brown color. I am glad that they put the warning for experienced guidos and guidettes because the heat factor is no joke, but that&#x27;s why I like it so much. WONDERFUL PRODUCT, I would recommend this to any experienced tanner!</li>
    <li> This tingle to me is light but the fragrance was ahhhmazing... it smelled really alot like Hawaiian tropic sunless tanner but its like got a sweeter scent anyhow it will make your skin so so so so so so so SOFT..and NO AFTER tan smell either.. I give this five stars because you also darken after you tan so its a win for anyone looking to get super dark,super quick!!</li>
    <li> I got this lotion a few days ago and was SO excited to use it! For some reason I decided to put it on at home before I went to the salon and thank god I did!! I was BRIGHT RED in a matter of five minutes and BURNING! It was a terrible feeling, thank god I wasn&#x27;t in a tanning bed! I knew this was gonna happen but not to this extreme. The sensation was so bad I actually started getting nauseous and thought I was gonna puke. Ugh. It was crazy. Anyway, I definitely do not recommend this lotion if you&#x27;re not an \\&quot;expert tanner\\&quot;. If you like HOT and TINGLE lotions than go for it!! But if you&#x27;re anything like me and haven&#x27;t used one yet don&#x27;t do it!!</li>
    <li> I have used several tanning products over the years and was shocked at the effects of this product!  I have never gotten results even close to this with other products! Within two visits to the tanning salon people started asking me if I was spending my weekends outdoors basking in the sun (don&#x27;t I wish!). The tingling effects of the product did take a bit of getting used to but wasn&#x27;t bothersome just odd...now I am used to it and don&#x27;t even notice it.  Additionally, I like the smell. The price of this product is well worth what you get and then some! I have paid far more for far less results!</li>
    <li> This lotion provides great color and has a good tingle, but it leaves a pretty bad after tan smell.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews and decided to buy it. I try to get color during for the summer. I usually do both fake &amp; bake and live at the beach. First try it was amazing color. Got great color! Thumbs up to Snooki and her crew.</li>
    <li> Definitely a very hot tingle. I started using it at first when I wasn&#x27;t tan at all. I waited until I was a little darker and the tingle wasn&#x27;t near as bad. So it&#x27;s really best to use after you&#x27;ve got some color to your skin instead of using right when winter ends and you&#x27;re super pale! Love it. And the sent is awesome</li>
    <li> It smells great and works well but It doesn&#x27;t get hot until 5 or so minutes into the tanning session and I want it immediately.</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion when I have a base tan, If i use it as an every day lotion the tingle gets to be too much, I usually mix it with another lotion so the tingle isnt too bad, but it makes you super dark, also dont let the redness from the tingle freak you out, it only lasts alittle bit then turns in to tan!</li>
    <li> I have been going to a salon for about a month now and I was fine, until I tried this tanning lotion and broke out in a burning red rash all over my body, that came on in about 5 minutes. Bad itching and my mothers face started swelling and turn bright fire red it looked like you layed in the sun for 8 hours without any sunscreen. I do not recommend this tanning lotion to anyone with sensitive skin and like a fire burning sensatition or really red skin. Glad I didn&#x27;t get in the tanning bed!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this tanning lotion. I&#x27;m a pretty pale color,and wanted fast results using a tanning bed,and this definitely got me at least a shade or two darker in ONE use.I highly recommend this to anyone looking for fast results,and it smells awesome too.:-)</li>
    <li> Great tan and great color!!  if feels a little itchy for a few mitues about 10 minutes after tanning.. Great</li>
    <li> The lotion will leave you with a dark golden tan after only a couple of sessions. I find it to be one off the better products on the market.</li>
    <li> Supre Snooki Dark tanning lotion gives you that blush tint to your tan that makes you look like you just got out of the sun. I love that extra effect.</li>
    <li> Overall, the product does produce a great bronze color. But it has this tingling stuff in it that makes you feel like you&#x27;re  on fire. I really thought I had an allergic reaction until the lady at the tanning salon explain to me the chemicals in the product. I&#x27;m thankful I didn&#x27;t put it on my face while tanning, otherwise I would look like a lobster. After a about a week of using it, the tingling got less and less, but I don&#x27;t plan on getting this again.</li>
    <li> I chose this lotion because I like snooki products and I am now hooked to this. I wanted something that took my tan to the next level and this has done the trick I&#x27;m a nice dark brown. This is not for beginners and do not use on your face.I will definatly be purchasing this again. And delivery was great got it in 4 days. Very happy over all.</li>
    <li> Great will def buy more my wife is wanting some more now but what she had lasted about a year</li>
    <li> I have tried to many tanning lotions to list...This is by far one of the best lotions i have tried,the tingle factor took a lil getting used to,it is Hot but the results make it worth it..</li>
    <li> Good experience will order again</li>
    <li> I give it a 5 star rating. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> this smells pretty good, goes on light, but BURNS like fire ... you better be careful with this tingle its massive</li>
    <li> Definately Better than the price you pay at the tanning shop!! And she loved it!! So were both happy campers!! Lol</li>
    <li> Has a ton of tingly factor so be prepared. Works great</li>
    <li> This smells like candy and I love the packaging. All of this line smells like candy.Make sure to use correctly and not on face because its hot bronzer.</li>
    <li> This is a good product but I thought it would have a more intense tingling. It is a good bronzer and does not stain your hands.</li>
    <li> If you want to get dark really quick then I  highly recommend getting this lotion .  The first week in using this lotion you will see a difference ! I&#x27;m already a few shades darker. Remember , it does have a bronzer and tingle . You will want to let it set for a few hours after you tan. If you do feel super burnt .... then use very little next time . Be carful though , some people that sell this lotion on here tamper with the product . I had no problems with this seller . I highly recommend !</li>
    <li> thought it would b hot</li>
    <li> This product does not seem like what it is intended to be. It seems very weak and watered down. I had to add a packet of Ed Hardy Body Shots to get the tingle promised.</li>
    <li> I work got a tanning salon &amp; only use this lotion. I love it. Perfect tingle sensation &amp; it works unbelievably good. I advise this for all tingle lovers like myself!</li>
    <li> I purchased this on Monday this week and it got to my house this morning (Thursday) I am SOOO in love with this lotion! I would say it&#x27;s medium intensity as far as tingles go. I would recommend applying it on just your legs the first time you use it if you are not familiar with how a tingle feels. Also the tingle lasts about 2 hours after you tan, and then there&#x27;s not burning or itching which is nice! Also do NOT work out or any sort of physical activity after you tan and before you shower because it can reactivate the lotion. Ouch! Anyways I LOVE this lotion!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favoite tanning lotion. It has a tingler in it along with bronzing and when you use it in the tanning bed you are two shades darker when you get out. I buy this same product everytime I get low on the one I have. I think I have used different sellers each time but dont&#x27; realize it. It shipped very quickly and was in great conditon. Nothing broke off or anything,I will definitely continue to buy this as long as they sell it.</li>
    <li> This is the only tanning lotion to have a hot enough accelerator in it and instantly tans my stubborn skin. Love it and will recommend it to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> I do not tan easily and this lotion has given me so much color in a short amount of time.... I love it! I have tried many different lotions and this one works the best for me.. Great smell, great color!!!</li>
    <li> This product met all of our expectations, works great both in and out of the tanning salon.  Speedy shipment as well!</li>
    <li> I received my bottle last Friday and headed to the tanning salon immediately (I live in the keys but can&#x27;t tan outside). I was a little nervous because of other reviews that it would just be to hot but I used the Super Bed anyways. There was a slight burning sensation but not that bad and I have extremely sensitive skin, but the results afterwards are amazing. The burning didn&#x27;t last to long and it wasn&#x27;t extreme. I think I will be switching off though with my other Snooki Bronzing lotion. Def will buy again! I only recommend this for experienced tanners though, I already had a base tan.</li>
    <li> Let me just start by saying I am a mother to a beautiful baby girl, and I love to tan. I can&#x27;t use a tingle lotion all the time ( I don&#x27;t wAnt to burn my little girl) so I only use tingles right before work so I can wait some hours before showering aNd playing with my little one. I usually just try differant packets but got fed up paying 5-7$ a packet, so I ordered this cuz aCcording to peoples reveiws on amazon it gives good results with low tingle. I received it today, while on my waY out the door to go tanning before work so if course I used it, and wow. I&#x27;ve never seen such good results from a tingle, and the tingle was very light also so that&#x27;s wonderful, I am so sold on snooki tanning products that it&#x27;s all I use now, aNd her tingle is a nice edition to my collection( I have the legs lotion and the ultra dark bronzer) I am very pleased with the product . The bottle is a bit mangled but that&#x27;s not a deal beaker. Anyways after my tanning session my mother called and asked if I could come right home because I had my daughters car seat, so I washed my hands and drove home, I had to touch my daughter before I showered and the tingle in the lotion is so light it didn&#x27;t even affect her! It&#x27;s wonderful I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Scent- Smells like Jolly Ranchers and strawberries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lotion- medium brown color and easy to rub in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tingle- The tingle in this I would say is moderate. I think maybe a little to much for beginners but should be fine for those who&#x27;ve been using tingles for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results- This lotion does tingle and gets you red at first just like it&#x27;s supposed to do and does get you dark. I wait overnight to shower and the next morning some of it did wash off but it does give you a good tan. I do recommend Modern Bombshell over this one but thats just my preference.&lt;br /&gt;4/5 stars from me</li>
    <li> I first used this product because my sister in law had it. I loved it so much I have order this 2X since.  would highly recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this product, arrived on time, and is exactly how it is described, i would order again. i love it.</li>
    <li> OMGOSH! You wanna talk about some hot sheeet! This stuff was terrible! I applied like it said didn&#x27;t even step into the tanning bed and I was burning from head to toe! Holy heck this stuff was NOT for me! And....... it took over 2 hours for it to releive the burn! Would NEVER EVER buy this again. Sorrrrry Snooki :)</li>
    <li> smell is fantastic its thick but goes on smooth good medium tingle only it doesnt really get my legs tan</li>
    <li> Just so everybody knows, this is NOT a tingle lotion, it is a hot lotion and all it does is warm you. It did not give me the color I wanted, and I could have gotten just as dark without any lotion. Not to mention the smell afterwords is AWFUL. Save your money and go but a real tingle if you want maximum color.</li>
    <li> I had read through the other comments and was a little worried with the &amp;#34;burning sensation&amp;#34; everyone was having. But I went and bought it. I tried it last night and I think I put too much on, I tingled and burned for 3 hours after and I was as red as a lobster. But I woke up this morning with a nice tan and no more burning. I like the end results, so if you can get past the burning I&#x27;d say buy it. If not, don&#x27;t even try it. Not for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells great, it has a fruity scent.  It also gives a mild tingle when tanning and gives good color.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for an extreme tingle but what I got was a mild to moderate one. Having hit a plateau,  I knew I needed a tingle that was strong.  The other tingle I was using previously had lost its umph. This tingle wasn&#x27;t as powerful as I&#x27;d hope,  but that&#x27;s okay.  My results, on the other hand, were lovely .  Nice dark even tan after one session.  Purely golden brown without a hint of orange.  I&#x27;m very pleased.  I don&#x27;t I&#x27;ve ever seen such great results after one session before.  This lotion is definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> Just bought the bottle cuz of the great reviews and I loooove tingle lotions. First off I received the lotion in 2 days with standard shipping, estimated time was 5-7 days! Anyway, I got noticeably darker after one use, the tingle is perfect and smells like fruit roll ups which I think is a yummy smell. So if u like a strong tingle and aready have a base tan I highly recommend, however I&#x27;ve been hearing a lot about fake lotions being sold on amazon, some which were other snookie lotions so be carefully. Mine was defanitly the real deal but was nervous of that happening. Very happy with my new lotion I&#x27;ll be sticking with it for a while!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a tanner I love tanning every year around summer time, but this product felt like hells fire on my skin after only 10 minutes and the burn lasted for 2 hours!  Not to mention I was red as a lobster...however the package does warn you of this so just be cautious if you&#x27;ve never used this product before.</li>
    <li> i will NEVER buy another bronzer again in my life!! im def hooked on Snooki Ultra Hot Bronzer (pink bottle)!! i have used Luminary, Obsidian, Jwoww and i do love all those as well but Snooki has gotten me the darkest!! its a tingle so you will turn red and burn, but it goes away in life an hour!! the results are awesome!! you will not be disappointed!! i will be a loyal buyer to this lotion for life!! it smells like fruit roll ups too, so yummy!! PLEASE BUY THIS IF YOU WANT TO GET DARK AND SMELL YUMMY AFTER!!</li>
    <li> This lotion is great for experienced tingle users. If you&#x27;re not experienced and want to try one, I suggest cutting your tan time in half of what you normally do. I work at a tanning salon and this is how I worked my way up to the more intense tingles. The redness goes away! The bonus with the snooki lotion is that it has bronzers that sink into the skin more quickly through the sensation of the tingle. You feel burned, for about an hour (unless you use a tanning relief such as I MIST YOU, which is a pH balancer). However, if you&#x27;re really looking to get dark quick, this lotion is the way to go!!</li>
    <li> Feels fine until about 3 mins into the tan it starts feeling like your skins on fire burning, never again</li>
    <li> I like this stuff, but holy crap it burns! I would NOT recommend using this EVERY time you tan (if you go more than once a week). Smells good, but it really does burn and makes my skin itch. Not in an allergic reaction way, but itch like when you get a sun burn. The burning is not a &amp;#34;slight tingling&amp;#34; sensation..it BURNS. The burning and itching lasts up to 4 hrs (for me), unless I shower immediantly after. The burning and the itching go away once you wash it off. When you first get out of the tanning bed, it does make you look darker, but it&#x27;s literally because your skin is red hot from burning. It did make my tan last a little bit longer and it does smell good.</li>
    <li> I bought this about 6 months ago and I absolutly love this product.  I kind of figured it was going to work really well for some reason.  When you put it on, it starts to tingle all over, and enhances the tingly feeling when you lay in the bed.  It does state on the back of the bottle that it does tingle, so don&#x27;t freak out thinking something&#x27;s wrong. I would not recommend to put this prodoct on your face.  Over all, buy this product; it works very well.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is no joke! This will seriously set you on FIYA! If you love tingle, you will love this and it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I bought this expensive lotion by Snooki and unfortunately by skin broke out red and itchy. I had to give it to someone else as a gift. My skin has never been allergic to any product except this-- so I was quite shocked. Maybe too many chemicals were used. Just be cautious if you have sensitive skin. (Although mine wasn&#x27;t sensitive, it just broke out because of too many products used in the making of this lotion) Beware.</li>
    <li> Just got this lotion in today and after not tanning for several days I used this and saw instant results!! It doesn&#x27;t have the tingle that I expected but that was just fine because it done the trick and smells great. Reminds me of grape flavored bubble gum.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. I bought a sample pack from my salon and had to buy me a bottle but was not going to pay 67.00 for it. The price was great and shipping was very fast! I am kinda new to the hot lotions but out of the ones ive tried this is the best. The heat can get pretty intense at first but its worth it after u see the result, would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Definitely  love this lotion&lt;br /&gt;yes it does get hot but THATS WHAT ITS SUPPOSED TO DO PEOPLE !!! Its a HOT lotion.!?.&lt;br /&gt;if you dont like feeling like your sunburnt i recommend you stick regular lotions..</li>
    <li> This broke me out so bad. I had to go to the doctor and get a steroid and a cream.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great if you want brown tan skin instead of the orangey bronze color.... I have used a lot of tanning products from Luminary from Designer skin, Obsidian, Bomb shell, and many more designer skin products, I have even used te Jwoww tanning lotion too. All seem to give me a more orangey looking tan. It wasnt as orange as like spray on tan &amp; I honestly never really noticed until I looked at pictures of me &amp; people told me.... But the Snooki ultra hot left a nice brown color... At 1st I was skeptical cuz I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference till I woke up plus I used Jwoww&#x27;s lotion &amp; wasn&#x27;t impressed at all... I&#x27;m not going to lie the redness after you use it lasts a while but it goes away, &amp; the tingle sensation isn&#x27;t painful just more irritating &amp; itchy then other tingerlers I&#x27;ve use in the past but it is tolerable none the less &amp; way worth it because of the results you get. I love it &amp; the tan doesn&#x27;t fade as fast either so that is always a plus too.i recommend buying this lotion &amp; I am definately going to purchase again....</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend and she absolutely loves it. I however, while smelling this lotion got some on myself and broke out in a lovely patch of hives. If you can take the heat of extreme tingle lotions this is a great choice! It definitely breaks through any tanning plateau that one might run into. It brings out the darkest tan possible. Just be wary if you&#x27;ve never used a tingle this extreme before, if you haven&#x27;t I high suggest trying a packet out before hand. On another note don&#x27;t ever pay $60+ at a tanning salon when you can get the same thing on Amazon!</li>
    <li> It does the trick but as far as a tingle I did not feel any. I dont usually put the tingle lotion on my face and the time I did I felt it there.</li>
    <li> tried a sample of this yesterday and im literally 3 shades darker after laying for 20 min. the tingle isnt too bad and it doesnt get too hot at all. i just bought a bottle its amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tanned here and there since I have light skin.  I&#x27;ve never tried a hot bronzer until this and I LOVE it!  Those giving it 1 star reviews because of the tingle sensation...well that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s suppose to do!  That&#x27;s what hot lotions do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I get pretty dark with this lotion.  :)</li>
    <li> This lotion works pretty well. It does get hot, so be prepared. I was using obsidian, which works great, but I wanted to add a little heat. The smell is nice and the bronzer is decent, it&#x27;s just a little too warm for me.</li>
    <li> I AM 46 YEARS OLD ,HAVE TANNED MOST OF MY LIFE,AND SPENT ALOT OF MONEY ON LOTIONS.I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING .THIS BY FAR ,IS THE BEST EVER. BUY IT ONLINE ALOT CHEAPER.I AM HOOKED.THANK YOU SNOOK!</li>
    <li> This lotion SMELLS awsome! IT GETS ME REALLY DARK!!! IT is a tingle HOWEVER it does not burn the crap out of me like other HOT TINGLE lotions... ITS MORE OF A BRONZER.... BUT A REALLY REALLY PRETTY COLOR.</li>
    <li> First off I combine this with another lotion takes tingle down a notch. Also when using for the first time do not put a bunch on your face. I am a darker skinned girl and even I looked like I had been burnt. I was not just the tingling sensation literally gave me gooseflesh. But it does the job, I am darker without tanning as long and it smells delicious! Reminds me of fruit gushers</li>
    <li> Tried a sample of this at my local tanning salon and fell in love! I am shades darker after each tan!</li>
    <li> Its not very hot bu works pretty good.</li>
    <li> This sunbed lotion causedd me to break out in welts all over my body every time I used it. I&#x27;ve used lots of other lotions and that has never happened.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this! Its the heat reacting so your body gets hot! I love this kind it makes me feel like it is working! Its not sticky like some! And smells amazing!!!!!! My friends like to put it on because of how great it smells.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, Hot means hot, warms your skin up</li>
    <li> I have been using Snooki tanning lotion for a while but this is the first time I have tried the Ultra Dark Hot Bronzer. It does burn but its not unbearable. It&#x27;s a good burn lol I love Snooki lotion. I would recommend this for experienced tanners.</li>
    <li> Love all of her products</li>
    <li> Wow... This stuff is great!!! Really hot! It was very expensive at the tanning salon, so I order here and was totally happy.</li>
    <li> So I thought I&#x27;d post a review n hope it can help someone else... first off if your looking for a great bronzer n tingler lotion look no further, this is the real deal!! I absolutely LOVE this lotion and obsessed! Snooki REALLY came thru with a great product (which I wasn&#x27;t too sure about cuz I wasn&#x27;t buying just cuz of name, just saying) but I did TONS of research on a great bronzer/tingler and in the end purchased this and I&#x27;m sooo glad I did!! Here&#x27;s why: for starters it smells AMAZING!! Really smells like fruit rollups n deliciousness :) I&#x27;m infatuated with the smell!! It is a bronzer and tingler in one which is what I wanted!! &amp; has just the right  amount of both...It doesn&#x27;t turn you orange like an oompa~loompa nor stain your hands or I&#x27;m between fingers, no streaking!! Yay!! It has special dha formula that keeps tanning you even after the tanning bed... it has moisturizer that leaves your skin silky smooth... it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling dirty or icky (some tanning lotion has this weird nasty residue that rubs off) I went thru Amazon seller which I looked into n they had just about perfect review n great reputation (read about horror stories of ppl getting ripped off n sold fake lotion) I ordered my bottle late Friday night like elevenish n received day n a half later on Sunday afternoon (so did free two day shipping and got my bottle of awesomeness super fast) within half hour of receiving I was already at tanning salon using and was in total abliss and tanning happiness ;) I have a good base tan but just one use in standard bed n twenty mins this took my color to a whole &#x27;nother level!! I came out looking good, smelling good, and feeling good!! And got it at a faction of its cost.. totally worth the investment I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!! This is a great product and deff a steal.. I&#x27;m hooked!! Tanning sistas look no further this is the AMAZING lotion n product you need in your tanning life!! For real!! Thanks Amazon prime and real true honest seller... you made me one happy woman ;)  hopefully this review can help another tanner and make another persons day like it did mine when I received it!! #take care. #happy tanning. #enjoy the good life</li>
    <li> This is the best by far hot bronzer tanning lotion! if your like me and cant tan fast and need a boost of bronzer this is the tanning lotion you need and it also keeps your skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this tanning lotion! It does make you really red at first, but goes away after an hour.</li>
    <li> This lotion has me a little torn. I&#x27;m not really sure if I like it or not. It&#x27;s SUPER hot for one. If you don&#x27;t like lotions that tingle, don&#x27;t even go near this stuff! I literally sat on the couch, and within minutes got up and someone sat where I had been and they starting tingling and turning red too! Overall, I had high expectations for this lotion. I bought it at a local salon and paid double the price it is on here. The lady convinced me it was her best seller. I used the entire bottle once I convinced myself to get my moneys worth and use it up. I didn&#x27;t get any darker than before when I used a cheap lotion. The bronzer streaked, and no matter how hard I scrubbed my hands were dyed orange. I will never buy this again. Sorry Snooki, I love you but your lotion is a let down.</li>
    <li> The product was okay, after tanning my skin burns for a couple hours.  It feels like a sun burn but the end result is great.  I love the smell &amp; I love how fast I tan.</li>
    <li> Ok this product does have a very nice smell and good texture. It rubbed in nicely and is not overly greasy feeling. It did not have a strong tingle to me though. It got warm but thats about all on me. I think it might burn if you were not used to a tingle lotion. I am used to Body Butter Red...now that gets hot. But all in all it is a good lotion..maybe not for beginners though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for a very long time and other lotions didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference in my tan. This product is wonderful, leaves a heated tan sensation as well as a beautiful bronze appearance ! I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I love Snooki product</li>
    <li> Fast shipping- but this is burned and tingled HORRIBLE. I see nothing about a tingle in the ad that is why i purchased. I am going to exchange or return. But i cannot use this at all.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! I&#x27;ve never used a tingle before and my friend talked me into trying it.  I use it in a mega bed and the first time I actually wanted to get</li>
    <li> I am just curious before I go there and waste money on something that only has a measly 19, 25 or 50Xs the DARK TANNING BRONZERS! I want the shit!!!  I want something 100Xs of ULTRA,DEEP &amp; DARK BRONZER or greater THAN 100Xs that actually works!&lt;br /&gt;  Any suggestions?</li>
    <li> I thought that I was having an allergic reaction because of how much burning I was feeling. I sold it to my friend after one use. I stayed in the bed for 4 minutes tops and it got me burnt. I&#x27;ve been tanning for two months now. It will get you tanned for sure but I do not recommend if you aren&#x27;t already used to really &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; lotions.</li>
    <li> I had to return this because it wasn&#x27;t what I thought it was. I wanted the gradual tanning lotion. When I got it in the mail and applied it, it burned like crazy. I couldn&#x27;t stand it. I washed it off immediacy and it still burned for at least 30 minutes after. luckily I only put it on my legs.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love! Worth the money:)</li>
    <li> Great item will buy again. Has a nice scent a little ATO but that&#x27;s okay. It really depends on how much of is stuff you put on as to how hot it will get.</li>
</ol>
