      <li>This was a great product.  </li>
      <li>Colors, nice and bright lol, sort of neon like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I suppose would be good if that is what i bought it for by</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>Feels good and strengthens the hands too.</li>
      <li>It is a very good fine motor activity for him.</li>
      <li>Great for fine motor skills.</li>
      <li>This has done an amazing job for me.</li>
      <li>Honestly for the amount you get at this price</li>
      <li>and I liked it</li>
      <li>Now instead of just being able to use it during my PT sessions, I have my own at home and have been using it three times a day.  </li>
      <li>it reminded me of the movie Over The Top, where Stallone (Hawk in the movie)</li>
      <li>This stuff is great, and the price seems reasonable here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>6oz of this putty is plenty for me and for many others I&#x27;m sure unless you&#x27;re 7&#x27; tall or more with hands like Shaq.</li>
      <li>You want to be able to squeeze it and you don&#x27;t want it melting all over you</li>
      <li>ok . . . . . etc . . . .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I could have went with 4oz</li>
      <li>I work with Autiistic students and they love this .</li>
      <li>but I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this putty would be fine if you had very strong hands and just wanted to keep them that way.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fun, useful good quality product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading if you do and best of luck with your injury and/or health in the future.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s easy to keep and use.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this if you are looking for a good quality therapy putty.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure with full health</li>
      <li>I sort of lucked out with the medium RED being pretty much perfect</li>
      <li>The firmness was accurate and it will help build my son&#x27;s strength in his hands to help him with his fine motor skills.</li>
      <li>We purchased the bright green and have been very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just fun to play with!</li>
      <li>when in full health.</li>
      <li>Which is perfect as it allows me to work both the extensor and flexor muscles to rehab them properly and make them stronger for the future.</li>
      <li>and he becomes disinterested quickly.</li>
      <li>quick ship - works</li>
      <li>Final notes, go one step below what you think you can handle whether in good health or not, don&#x27;t over do it with this stuff especially the stronger resistance as it may cause more harm than good and if you&#x27;re not sure about the amount get the 6oz or more as you can always take some off and put it away.</li>
      <li>Cheap fast shipping.</li>
      <li>and thus I&#x27;m glad I went with 6oz as having the extra putty allows me to use a \\&quot;custom\\&quot; amount to fit my hands</li>
      <li>I bought Thera-Flex Therapy Putty for my four year old son after his teacher instructed me that his fine motor skills needed to be improved.</li>
      <li>it has the exact resistance we need to practice my 5-year-old&#x27;s finger muscles.</li>
      <li>First off the amount and for reference my palm is 3 5/8\\&quot; across.</li>
      <li>It works exactly how it should.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d be able to squeeze the firm multiple times for a good forearm workout though I think the medium is going to be plenty for now.</li>
      <li>Thanks Isokinetics!</li>
      <li>It was recommended by our therapist after a recent surgery and my husband and I both love it.  </li>
      <li>It is exactly as described</li>
      <li>I received the product in a timely manner and product was exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only a few bucks and in this case would be better to start too easy, instead of getting something you&#x27;ll never be able to utilize.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite rubbery and thick but melts with body heat very nicely.</li>
      <li>but the medium and below does and most likely would provide plenty of resistance for us normal folks.</li>
      <li>The 6 oz is large and fills the hand.  </li>
      <li>Non-oily, no residue, similar to what my local PT clinic uses (they use 4 oz, adequate size for most uses).  </li>
      <li>and I hope I didn&#x27;t ramble on too much.</li>
      <li>It really helped to strengthen my hand and regain some range of motion.  </li>
      <li>VERY SOOTHING.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s cool is after seeing the blue colored putty</li>
      <li>This item is highly recommended to anyone that needs in home therapy.</li>
      <li>&quot;, this seems to be high quality medical/therapeutic type putty.</li>
      <li>my limited but decent amount of time with this stuff (who needs more than 15 minutes with putty lol), I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t be afraid to order the xtra soft or soft first</li>
      <li>Thank you for making this available to the general public.</li>
      <li>but it was more firm resistance than medium.</li>
      <li>IT ALSO IS DOWN RIGHT FUN TO USE.</li>
      <li>Following a stroke I needed something to strengthen my right hand.  </li>
      <li>Honestly and even with my decent strength while slightly injured I wish I had gone with a 3 step process with this stuff going from the xtra soft, soft and medium but was so scared of the soft versions being too soft.</li>
      <li>It has just the right amount of resistance for my son (he&#x27;s 9 and has poor fine motor strength).  </li>
      <li>There has been marked improvement in the strength and mobility in my hands since I bought this for home-use.  </li>
      <li>It makes absolutely no mess, doesn&#x27;t stick to clothes and he loves it.</li>
      <li>, it takes a decent bit of force to fully mush it between your fingers especially with a slight injury but honestly and especially with an injury like a strained muscle or other things</li>
      <li>I wish I had gone with the xtra soft or soft to start with and then went onto the medium for the last step until I was strong enough to advance to something like the coral, green or blue.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Currently my Brachioradialis muscle on both arms have been strained with possible micro tears, especially on the dominant one (right side)</li>
      <li>I took into account that I still have decent strength even with my strained muscles and how strong I am (or not lol)</li>
      <li>In fact I may just order the xtra soft and/or soft for the hell of it as the medium and firm may be just a bit too much too early for my injury.</li>
      <li>Obviously don&#x27;t let it sit in direct sunlight or put it in the freezer.</li>
      <li>It was a little to firm wasn&#x27;t able to use it.</li>

<li> I got the medium resistance thinking it would be strong silly putty, without the sticky.</li>

<li> If you&#x27;re a bodybuilder or powerlifter either in full health or slightly injured the coral and especially green and blue would suit you well</li>

<li> I normally keep this in the container with small pop beads hidden inside of it.</li>
<li> Also I highly doubt I would touch the blue for a long while as green is fairly tough even at body temp.</li>
<li> Arrived on time and as expected</li>
<li> I sat for about 15 minutes working with it in each hand, letting it get to body temp or so and going from squeezing the life out of it to just barely any pressure at all and letting it slowly soften between my fingers before I jumped on here to post a review.</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rehab center sold me this putty for half of Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
<li> unless you know you&#x27;re strength ability injured or not and even then I&#x27;d go one step down from what you may be planning to get.</li>
<li> My other son who has no fine motor issues just loves to play with the putty.</li>
<li> I put little toys in the putty.</li>
<li> but it may of been too little</li>
<li> and I used it everyday to strengthen my hand muscles in between my therapy sessions.  </li>
<li> It completely fills the 6 oz plastic container it comes in, and is somewhat difficult to extract each time you use it.  </li>
<li> I picked up the green stuff and have no problems with it being too firm, but then I&#x27;m not using it for &amp;#34;therapeutic&amp;#34; reasons either;  </li>
<li> And they have to pull hard to get them out.</li>
<li> MY HANDS SEEM TO BE GETTING WEAK WITH AGE.</li>
<li> My progress was very slow until I purchased this Thera-flex putty.  </li>
<li> Used this putty to rehab a broken hand and arm.</li>
<li> At least it seems just like Silly Putty.  </li>
<li> Hopefully, I will never need to buy anything like this again, but I would recommend it to anyone that has a broken hand</li>
<li> Washing couldn&#x27;t save the EXPENSIVE bedding.</li>
<li> This is not \\&quot;silly putty\\</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received the product in a timely manner and product was exactly what I ordered.</li>
    <li> Thera putty was recommended to us by my son&#x27;s OT. We purchased the bright green and have been very pleased with it. It has just the right amount of resistance for my son (he&#x27;s 9 and has poor fine motor strength).  I normally keep this in the container with small pop beads hidden inside of it. I make my son take it out and then pull all the beads out to string together. It is a very good fine motor activity for him. My other son who has no fine motor issues just loves to play with the putty. It does not leave a big mess or residue on our hands. Highly recommend this if you are looking for a good quality therapy putty.</li>
    <li> It was a little to firm wasn&#x27;t able to use it.</li>
    <li> I got this for a child with Autisms find motor strength. I got the medium resistance thinking it would be strong silly putty, without the sticky. It is not as sticky thankfully but it was more firm resistance than medium.</li>
    <li> I work with Autiistic students and they love this . I put little toys in the putty. And they have to pull hard to get them out. Great for fine motor skills.</li>
    <li> It works exactly how it should. The firmness was accurate and it will help build my son&#x27;s strength in his hands to help him with his fine motor skills.</li>
    <li> It arrived at my house in time and I liked it</li>
    <li> The puddy melts if you leave it anywhere. It sat on our bed for around 10 minutes while I hopped in a shower. When I came out the puddy how melted into the fabric. Washing couldn&#x27;t save the EXPENSIVE bedding. Massive DO NOT BUY! Get a quality order and avoid this outcome.</li>
    <li> Non-oily, no residue, similar to what my local PT clinic uses (they use 4 oz, adequate size for most uses).  The 6 oz is large and fills the hand.  It completely fills the 6 oz plastic container it comes in, and is somewhat difficult to extract each time you use it.  It behaves like a viscous liquid and will flow with gravity.</li>
    <li> his product is just like it says, it works well as a therapy aid, I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This was a great product.  It really helped to strengthen my hand and regain some range of motion.  Hopefully, I will never need to buy anything like this again, but I would recommend it to anyone that has a broken hand</li>
    <li> It is exactly as described and I used it everyday to strengthen my hand muscles in between my therapy sessions.  The putty has helped me regain the muscle strength in my hands after surgery.  My progress was very slow until I purchased this Thera-flex putty.  Now instead of just being able to use it during my PT sessions, I have my own at home and have been using it three times a day.  There has been marked improvement in the strength and mobility in my hands since I bought this for home-use.  Thank you for making this available to the general public.</li>
    <li> Currently my Brachioradialis muscle on both arms have been strained with possible micro tears, especially on the dominant one (right side) and I am doing self rehab at the moment. RICE, working lightly with just the EZ curl bar every couple of days and working my extensor muscles with a thick rubber band around my fingers on both hands expanding about 20 times quickly and then slow while holding my hand open for a few seconds on the last 5. That said and while doing self rehab I looked into rehab exercises even further and seen therapy putty mentioned. Which is perfect as it allows me to work both the extensor and flexor muscles to rehab them properly and make them stronger for the future. What&#x27;s cool is after seeing the blue colored putty it reminded me of the movie Over The Top, where Stallone (Hawk in the movie) was squeezing some type of putty before he took on Smasher in the back room of the bar lol, makes sense as to why he was using it. Some will get this reference lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway and onto the product here. I took a couple of days before I decided on the amount I wanted and pressure needed to squeeze the putty. I took into account that I still have decent strength even with my strained muscles and how strong I am (or not lol) when in full health. First off the amount and for reference my palm is 3 5/8\\&quot; across. 6oz of this putty is plenty for me and for many others I&#x27;m sure unless you&#x27;re 7&#x27; tall or more with hands like Shaq. One color all rolled up is close to the size of a baseball. Honestly for the amount you get at this price it&#x27;s a steal! Thanks Isokinetics! I&#x27;m sure I could have went with 4oz but it may of been too little and thus I&#x27;m glad I went with 6oz as having the extra putty allows me to use a \\&quot;custom\\&quot; amount to fit my hands *hint hint*. I think I pulled off and used about 3/4 of it and put the rest back into the plastic bowl which is what it comes in. As for the quality, smell, color etc. This is not \\&quot;silly putty\\&quot;, this seems to be high quality medical/therapeutic type putty. I sat for about 15 minutes working with it in each hand, letting it get to body temp or so and going from squeezing the life out of it to just barely any pressure at all and letting it slowly soften between my fingers before I jumped on here to post a review. The texture of it is similar to silly putty but much better quality. It&#x27;s quite rubbery and thick but melts with body heat very nicely. When you work with it, it then starts to show the resistance it provides. Honestly and even with my decent strength while slightly injured I wish I had gone with a 3 step process with this stuff going from the xtra soft, soft and medium but was so scared of the soft versions being too soft. I&#x27;m sure with full health I&#x27;d be able to squeeze the firm multiple times for a good forearm workout though I think the medium is going to be plenty for now. I could have went with the coral but I wanted a step up to see where I would be with resistance. Also I highly doubt I would touch the blue for a long while as green is fairly tough even at body temp. If you&#x27;re a bodybuilder or powerlifter either in full health or slightly injured the coral and especially green and blue would suit you well but the medium and below does and most likely would provide plenty of resistance for us normal folks. In fact I may just order the xtra soft and/or soft for the hell of it as the medium and firm may be just a bit too much too early for my injury. Also this stuff should last a long time either for normal everyday use or for when you may need it again down the road. Obviously don&#x27;t let it sit in direct sunlight or put it in the freezer. You want to be able to squeeze it and you don&#x27;t want it melting all over you lol. As for smell, odorless or darn close. Colors, nice and bright lol, sort of neon like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my limited but decent amount of time with this stuff (who needs more than 15 minutes with putty lol), I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t be afraid to order the xtra soft or soft first unless you know you&#x27;re strength ability injured or not and even then I&#x27;d go one step down from what you may be planning to get. It&#x27;s only a few bucks and in this case would be better to start too easy, instead of getting something you&#x27;ll never be able to utilize. Don&#x27;t let your ego get in the way of proper exercise or rehab. I sort of lucked out with the medium RED being pretty much perfect, it takes a decent bit of force to fully mush it between your fingers especially with a slight injury but honestly and especially with an injury like a strained muscle or other things I wish I had gone with the xtra soft or soft to start with and then went onto the medium for the last step until I was strong enough to advance to something like the coral, green or blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it and I hope I didn&#x27;t ramble on too much. Final notes, go one step below what you think you can handle whether in good health or not, don&#x27;t over do it with this stuff especially the stronger resistance as it may cause more harm than good and if you&#x27;re not sure about the amount get the 6oz or more as you can always take some off and put it away. It&#x27;s a fun, useful good quality product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading if you do and best of luck with your injury and/or health in the future.</li>
    <li> Used this putty to rehab a broken hand and arm. This is something you can use to just strengthen your grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rehab center sold me this putty for half of Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> I bought Thera-Flex Therapy Putty for my four year old son after his teacher instructed me that his fine motor skills needed to be improved. She suggested letting him use play dough but he makes such a mess with it and he becomes disinterested quickly. I had never heard of this product before but I love it. It makes absolutely no mess, doesn&#x27;t stick to clothes and he loves it.</li>
    <li> At least it seems just like Silly Putty.  If someone had told me that that&#x27;s what it was like I probably wouldn&#x27;t have hesitated for so long before I bought it.  This stuff is great, and the price seems reasonable here on Amazon. I picked up the green stuff and have no problems with it being too firm, but then I&#x27;m not using it for &amp;#34;therapeutic&amp;#34; reasons either;  it&#x27;s just fun to play with!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this putty would be fine if you had very strong hands and just wanted to keep them that way.  I would call it Ultra-Firm Resistance.</li>
    <li> MY HANDS SEEM TO BE GETTING WEAK WITH AGE. I STARTED USING THIS PRODUCE AND CAN NOTICE AN INCREASE IN STRENGTH. IT ALSO IS DOWN RIGHT FUN TO USE. VERY SOOTHING.</li>
    <li> Following a stroke I needed something to strengthen my right hand.  This has done an amazing job for me.</li>
    <li> serves purpose for tennis elbow therapy</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as expected</li>
    <li> quick ship - works ok . . . . . etc . . . . etc  . . . . . etc . . . etc. . . . etc . . . .</li>
    <li> Good product. Cheap fast shipping. Just what the doctor ordered. Literally. This item is highly recommended to anyone that needs in home therapy.</li>
    <li> This putty works so well for sore hands and fingers, and helps arthritis pain too!!  It was recommended by our therapist after a recent surgery and my husband and I both love it.  Feels good and strengthens the hands too.</li>
    <li> it has the exact resistance we need to practice my 5-year-old&#x27;s finger muscles. And it&#x27;s easy to keep and use. What else do we ask for?</li>
    <li> I suppose would be good if that is what i bought it for by it is too flexible for what I needed it for.</li>
    <li> My mom has arthritic hands.  We implant pennies in the putty and she works the putty to remove them.  Since doing this exercise her fingers are stronger and getting straighter.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t meet expectations.</li>
