    <li> It is beautiful and very well done</li>
    <li> Very beautiful and well made. Really happy with it. My daughter loves it and will be wearing it for her Quincinera. My wife wanted to wear it for herself it is so beautiful. The top jewel was bent out of shape I had to bend it back. I shined a LED flashlight on it and it really sparkles! Price is way better than that fairyland place in Anaheim.</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful. This is about as identical as you can get to Davids bridal. Way cheaper!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice and sparkle, I can wait to wear it for my wedding ❤️❤️</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, secure packaging, beautiful piece. Made me feel amazing</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it. It was perfect for her wedding. She said the only thing was it should have padding of some sort at the ends of the headband because it did hurt her head. She wore it for the ceremony but had to take it off soon after for that reason. Otherwise, it looked awesome with her chapel length veil!</li>
    <li> I bought this tiara for my wedding day. Honestly, for $25 I did not expect it to be as great as quality as it is. It is absolutely gorgeous on the quality is fantastic. One of the smaller stones had fallen out I&#x27;m sure to shipping and handling. I easily put a tiny bit of glue on it and placed it back where it went and you can&#x27;t even tell. It goes wonderfully with my dress and veil!</li>
    <li> Honestly, for the price I was not expecting as pretty of a tiara as the picture showed. When I opened the box after receiving it, I was all smiles - it was beautiful. I&#x27;m using it for my wedding in June, so I wrapped it back up after looking over it. The shipping was really fast as well.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, just beautiful it came on</li>
    <li> This looks just like te one&#x27;s you see at bridal shop for over $100.00 I can&#x27;t wait to wear it in a few days. All my friends can&#x27;t believe i paid so little and how beautiful it is.</li>
    <li> i love it, can&#x27;t wait to wear it in my wedding :)</li>
    <li> did not like the quality at all&lt;br /&gt;there is no way that was made with Swarovski cristals!!!!</li>
    <li> What you do with your tax refund is your business but I needed this. I like to wear mine when I&#x27;m looking really hideous (we all have those days) and Occasionally when I&#x27;m cleaning the house. Sometimes even a princess has to clean the castle especially if she has kids.</li>
    <li> Looks even more beautiful and sparkly up close! Can&#x27;t wait to wear it! :-) Thank you!</li>
    <li> Its perfect. Delivery was fast, and tiara is so beautiful, great size, sparkles, and shines. It&#x27;s really gorgeous. Expect to pay for the same tiara at Davids Bridal at least $175.00.</li>

    <li> Very pretty! I bought this for my sister for her bridal shower. It looked fancy and high end and made her look classy not trashy. She did not anticipate wearing it but slipped it on and it stayed put all day long.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about how beautiful this Swarovski detailed tiara is. I wear it to the Disney Parks, (I like it better than ears), and get compliments on it every hour I am in the parks, from Disney Park attendees and especially from Disney cast members. They always ask where I got it from. I say the internet, but can never remember the sellers name. I will try harder to pass that along, now that I see it again. This is a beautiful tiara and I have seen similar ones at 3 to 4 times the price. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this tiara. It is so much prettier on my head then in the box!. I bought it for a friend but I decided to keep it for myself. I will buy a different one for her. We cant go out in public with the same tiara. This is to celebrate her 45th birthday and my 40th.</li>
    <li> This tiara is just beautiful!  It rivals those in the bridal shop that cost over a hundred dollars.  It is perfect with an elbow length veil.  The name sparkling absolutely fits it!</li>
    <li> This crown will make you feel just like a Beautiful Princess</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and it&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
    <li> I loved my Tiara. I was a beautiful bride on my wedding day. Great Price and Fast Shipping</li>
