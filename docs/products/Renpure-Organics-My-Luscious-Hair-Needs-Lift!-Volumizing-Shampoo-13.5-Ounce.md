      <li>The price was good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many volumizing shampoos in my day and this is one of the best -</li>
      <li>Works great on fine hair!</li>
      <li>The conditioner is great too (may want to use body and shine conditioner if you don&#x27;t have oily hair it adds more moisture).  </li>

      <li>I bought this shampoo and conditioner and noticed right away how great it was on my hair!</li>

      <li>I Love My Hair!</li>
      <li>My husband must wash his hair every day and this is perfect- does not dry out his hair and looks great.</li>
      <li>I now use Hugo Naturals which has no toxins in it and works great for my fine hair.  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s a nice shampoo nonetheless.</li>
      <li>Because my hair is very fine</li>
      <li>Love it....</li>
      <li>This just wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
      <li>I have thinning hair because of PCOS and have tried so many shampoos and conditioners throughout the years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many</li>
      <li>It imparts body, it&#x27;s safe and extends the color of my hair.</li>
      <li>I wanted to love it</li>
      <li>I love this product but it was not packaged well and was leaking out when I received it.  </li>
      <li>I emailed the company many times to no avail.  </li>
      <li>I liked the fact that it is paraben and silicon free.  </li>
      <li>Believe me, I have tried MANY shampoos and conditioners and this one has it beat.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s OK</li>
      <li>This is an OK product.</li>
      <li>Will not switch anytime soon:)  </li>
      <li>It looks like there is a layer of fine hair like on top of my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it is still available on Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>It has kept my colored gray hair in excellent condition without the use of a conditioner and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down as the moisterizing one does.  </li>
      <li>does seem to give body to baby fine hair</li>
      <li>So I have fine hair that has some curl and have been using WEN for probably around a year.</li>
      <li>I bought it for my children primarily.</li>
      <li>Overall I think it&#x27;s a great shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this shampoo made it appear a lot thicker and full of body.</li>
      <li>the smell is a clean smell.</li>
      <li>the renpure products my hair is clean and has bounce</li>
      <li>The kids hair is as clean as every.</li>
      <li>I ended up just giving this shampoo away because it didn&#x27;t really clean my hair like I wanted.  </li>
      <li>it is not always easy to find just the right shampoo</li>
      <li>It obviously did not make my hair grow, but it made it appear thicker and kept it so clean that it quit falling out!!!</li>
      <li>Have loved this product for several years.  </li>
      <li>Like the other one I bought, this is great as well.</li>
      <li>So, back to the renpure products because they are the best - I alternate between this one and &amp;#34;my</li>
      <li>It looks twice the size, smells nice, and doesn&#x27;t get greasy quickly (a problem with many other products).</li>
      <li>IT DOES ADD SOME VOLUME NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE ME VERY SATISFIED.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite.</li>
      <li>an aside, I recently tried Bumble &amp; Bumble Thickening Shampoo as well, and I like Renpure better!</li>
      <li>I ran across renpure products when I was looking for good sulfate free products with actual ingredients and low emulsifiers/glycerin content.</li>
      <li>My hair was soft, easier to manage, and full!</li>
      <li>and this helps it to stay clean and vibrant.</li>
      <li>i didnt like this very much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with shampoo; however, my hair does not have quite the lift that it when I first started using this shampoo several years ago.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff but can&#x27;t get it locally.  </li>
      <li>Love this product (have only tried Volume) and I will buy it again and again.</li>
      <li>At first I thought this stuff was working well.</li>
      <li>pretty hair is parched.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I rated it only with 4 stars because I wish it would give just a bit more body.  </li>
      <li>The top was partially open.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair full, soft and shiny with LOTS of volume!  </li>
      <li>many shampoos leave my hair greasy or flat.  </li>
      <li>Maybe my hair is just getting old and tired and the shampoo is doing its best!</li>
      <li>(so much so that it&#x27;s opened the spectrum of hair cuts I can get).</li>
      <li>It dries your hair if you have very greasy oily hair</li>
      <li>This stuff . . . not so much.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s gentle on my scalp and hair and really noticeably leaves my hair fuller.</li>
      <li>My hair was decently soft and healthy, but it definitely did not do what was promised.</li>
      <li>I saw this at a local grocer, and seeing that it was sulfate and paraben free, as well as in a different though unique bottle, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>Gets more lather than some other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands, although not a TON.</li>
      <li>the reason i gave this 3 stars and not 4 or 5 is because this product uses soy and one of its main ingredients which is not beneficial.</li>
      <li>I will use it once more since I spent money on it without the added conditioning measures I utilized the first time, but if I come out with the same result I&#x27;m going to have to get rid of it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Neuma organic shampoo for a year and although I love the smell, it left my hair flat.</li>
      <li>I am not a daily-washer; maybe every 2-3 days, but I found that on the first lather, it barely produces any suds.</li>
      <li>or course, has some wave to it, and might be a bit oilier than normal.  </li>
      <li>Try Loreal Paris&#x27; new products; the EverPure&#x27;s, and whatnot.</li>
      <li>You can also purchase it directly at their website along with free shipping with a minimal amount of purchase.</li>
      <li>After the first use, it left me with hair that felt</li>
      <li>I have a lot of superfine hair that get weighed down by any product or, sometimes, just itself, and have no time to learn/patience to blow-dry or spray my hair.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
      <li>I appreciate that it&#x27;s cruelty-free and also free of many bad ingredients, but it is definitely a product that could use some improvement, though perhaps it would be great for a different hair type (I have long, dark, fine hair that is now very dry after using this product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re lucky enough to get bottles with the rebates, you can actually pay NOTHING for these earth- and health-friendly products!</li>
      <li>Even though my hair was clearly drenched, it felt stripped to me.</li>
      <li>However, if you lather a second time, it gets very sudsy.</li>
      <li>and I have to wash it frequently because I am an aquatics instructor</li>
      <li>Volumizing effects are nonexistent, as far as I can tell.</li>
      <li>Who wants hair that looks coarse?</li>
      <li>but I noticed natural carcinogens in it on ewg.org.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Like the other one I bought, this is great as well. As I said in my other review, I hope they don&#x27;t sell the company to some big no-name company and they change the way it&#x27;s made, like some others have done in the past, i.e. Toms of Maine, Burts Bee&#x27;s, etc.</li>
    <li> I picked up this bottle months ago at the local grocery store as I had been wanting to try an organic shampoo. I&#x27;ve tried many many volumizing shampoos in my day and this is one of the best - it&#x27;s gentle on my scalp and hair and really noticeably leaves my hair fuller. There&#x27;s few other shampoos that noticeably volumize my hair, and even some of the ones that do will dry my hair and/or scalp out more than this shampoo. Plus, it&#x27;s organic, so I have less to worry about for my sensitive scalp. I came here today to re-order as I&#x27;m finally getting low, and will probably also try the I Love My Hair! Body and Shine in the green bottle as well.&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, I recently tried Bumble &amp; Bumble Thickening Shampoo as well, and I like Renpure better!</li>
    <li> I ran across renpure products when I was looking for good sulfate free products with actual ingredients and low emulsifiers/glycerin content. I have a lot of superfine hair that get weighed down by any product or, sometimes, just itself, and have no time to learn/patience to blow-dry or spray my hair.&lt;br /&gt;With the renpure products my hair is clean and has bounce (so much so that it&#x27;s opened the spectrum of hair cuts I can get). It looks twice the size, smells nice, and doesn&#x27;t get greasy quickly (a problem with many other products). I tried recently to use some other fancy conditioner that my boyfriend got for christmas and it made my hair all static-y. So, back to the renpure products because they are the best - I alternate between this one and &amp;#34;my pretty hair is parched.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This shampoo gives my hair texture and body without being frizzy. Works great on fine hair!</li>
    <li> It left a lot of build up in my hair. I wanted to love it but it left my hair feeling gross, filmy and weighed down.</li>
    <li> Believe me, I have tried MANY shampoos and conditioners and this one has it beat.  It leaves my hair full, soft and shiny with LOTS of volume!  GREAT shampoo.  Will not switch anytime soon:)  Love it....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product in stores before it went off the shelf. I must say I do love this shampoo over any other organic brands that I used previously. It is amazing!</li>
    <li> At first I thought this stuff was working well. I&#x27;ve used it exclusively about 8 - 9 times over the last 3 weeks, along with the conditioner. However, my hair is now REALLY dry, and the ends are almost crispy. It doesn&#x27;t help that it&#x27;s winter and the air is very dry, but I still think the same would have happened no matter the season. If you use this, and your hair feels a little off, a little weird afterward, DISCONTINUE using it. It is sapping your hair of moisture. I&#x27;ve never actually thrown a hair product out before, but this is going straight in the trash. Wouldn&#x27;t risk using it again on my or my daughter&#x27;s hair, nor on anyone else&#x27;s. Oh, yeah, the smell is not great, either.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff but can&#x27;t get it locally.  for some reason, my drugstores carry this brand but not this formula.  does seem to give body to baby fine hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with shampoo; however, my hair does not have quite the lift that it when I first started using this shampoo several years ago.  Maybe my hair is just getting old and tired and the shampoo is doing its best!</li>
    <li> I used to get this shampoo locally, but can&#x27;t find it on the shelves anymore.  I&#x27;m glad it is still available on Amazon.com.  I have straight, thin hair and this shampoo adds body and manageability without leave my hair greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> So I have fine hair that has some curl and have been using WEN for probably around a year. It was expensive, so after I finished my last bottle I decided to find something else. This product got excellent reviews so I decided to try it. The shampoo was so stripping on my hair. I used to receive compliments on my hair daily, and since the week I&#x27;ve been using this stuff it looks like I need a hair cut. My hair feels soft, but looks coarse. Who wants hair that looks coarse? My hair is not frizzy, but there are so many fly aways. It looks like there is a layer of fine hair like on top of my hair. However, I will say it gave me lift &amp; volume, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is an OK product. the smell is a clean smell. It isn&#x27;t delectable or anything but it&#x27;s OK the reason i gave this 3 stars and not 4 or 5 is because this product uses soy and one of its main ingredients which is not beneficial. The price was good. If you don&#x27;t mind elevated estrogen levels in yours or your children&#x27;s bodies then this is a GREAT product.</li>
    <li> Love the idea of organic shampoo, but this one has a strong unpleasant smell that persists throughout the house.  Try something else...</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair because of PCOS and have tried so many shampoos and conditioners throughout the years. I bought this shampoo and conditioner and noticed right away how great it was on my hair! My hair was soft, easier to manage, and full! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! It obviously did not make my hair grow, but it made it appear thicker and kept it so clean that it quit falling out!!! I will never switch again!!! When I ran out I bought another \\&quot;organic\\&quot; shampoo thinking it would do the same, but did not compare. Used it once and will never use it again. I&#x27;M STICKING WITH RENPURE ORGANICS!!!!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this shampoo made it appear a lot thicker and full of body. It has a subtle fragrance so you&#x27;re not overwhelmed with a prefumey smell. Love this product (have only tried Volume) and I will buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the garbage put into our bath products. I am happy I found this on amazon. I bought it for my children primarily. I will begin using it myself once I use up our current products. The kids hair is as clean as every. I am very happy I found this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product but it was not packaged well and was leaking out when I received it.  The top was partially open.</li>
    <li> I have had problems for the past few years with shampoo.  I&#x27;ve tried so many I can&#x27;t even count.  They all leave my hair feeling coated or greasy and weighed down, right out of the shower and freshly dried.  I don&#x27;t even use conditioner because the shampoo is moisturizing enough.  The waxy feeling is extremely irritating when you&#x27;ve just washed your hair!  My stylist told me to try an super expensive brand that was volumizing, it ended up just as bad as the cheapo stuff but wasted more money than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, Pantene, Herbal Essences, Garnier Fructis, and Matrix were the worst.  Even the clarifying shampoo (only one I could find in a store) by Suave ended up changing their formula and it started to make my hair feel waxy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran across Renpure a few weeks ago and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I liked the fact that it is paraben and silicon free.  It seems those two ingredients were the cause of my waxy feeling hair.  After the first use, it left me with hair that felt CLEAN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still don&#x27;t use the conditioners, even this shampoo leaves it detangled after showering.  The natural oils are plenty enough for my hair, but not \\&quot;coating\\&quot;.  I have normal thickness hair, it&#x27;s not fine or course, has some wave to it, and might be a bit oilier than normal.  I color my hair and I use blow driers and straighteners, but no products other than shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*EDIT* After about a week of use, my hair started to feel waxy again.  I had to go back to clarifying shampoo.  I ended up just giving this shampoo away because it didn&#x27;t really clean my hair like I wanted.  Too bad!</li>
    <li> IT DOES ADD SOME VOLUME NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE ME VERY SATISFIED. FAIR PRICE NOT A BAD PRODUCT  A NATURAL PRODUCT  SO THAT IS A PLUS.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neuma organic shampoo for a year and although I love the smell, it left my hair flat. I even thought my hair might be thinning, but after using the Renpure Organics, my hair is back to normal. It doesn&#x27;t lather a lot, but it&#x27;s an oil-based shampoo, from the ingredient list, so I didn&#x27;t expect it.  I did take other reviewer&#x27;s advice and make sure my hair is completely wet before using. This is my new favorite.</li>
    <li> great stuff and smell.</li>
    <li> Dried out and made hair crunchy and frizzy.</li>
    <li> I had bought this shampoo to try to moisturize/volumize my hair after i had highlighted it. I was hoping this would repair my damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- After Effect -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial thought when i opened the bottle was \\&quot;wow, this smells terrible\\&quot; i almost smelled like dirty dish water. It had made my hair unpleasently greasy. My hair ended up being dirtier after \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; it. My hair had become almost flakey. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> It dries your hair if you have very greasy oily hair</li>
    <li> Gets more lather than some other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands, although not a TON. But overall, I like it. And smells pleasant. Price wasn&#x27;t too bad either. Volumizing effects are nonexistent, as far as I can tell. But it&#x27;s a nice shampoo nonetheless.</li>
    <li> i didnt like this very much. it left my hair feeling dry and like it was lacking something. it did not give any volume to my hair. i probably wont be buy this or any product from this company again :(</li>
    <li> Have loved this product for several years.  It has kept my colored gray hair in excellent condition without the use of a conditioner and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down as the moisterizing one does.  The Redmond family has another with the Renpure Organics line of hair care products</li>
    <li> its a great product does volumizing the hair, i see difference in my hair and I am using the conditoner as well. It smells great will continue to use.</li>
    <li> My experience with this shampoo has been less than stellar. I appreciate that it&#x27;s cruelty-free and also free of many bad ingredients, but it is definitely a product that could use some improvement, though perhaps it would be great for a different hair type (I have long, dark, fine hair that is now very dry after using this product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many sulfate-free shampoos warn that they will not lather as well as other chemical-laden shampoos of yore- this one is no exception. I am not a daily-washer; maybe every 2-3 days, but I found that on the first lather, it barely produces any suds. However, if you lather a second time, it gets very sudsy. It should probably say &amp;#34;Lather, rinse, REPEAT&amp;#34; on its instructions rather than just &amp;#34;lather and rinse.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that after using up the bottle, my hair had become pretty dry- I usually cut off split-ends whenever I see them, and use of this product actually increased the frequency of this occurrence. I am not one who colors, heat-treats, or uses any product on hair asides from shampoo, conditioner, and sometimes blow-drying. Oh I also found that there is a lot of residue with the use of this shampoo, since my hairbrush would look gunky after a day or 2 of hair brushing following a shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, my scalp also seemed to become increasingly dry after using this product. The other day, I even had a painful pimple on my scalp which I&#x27;m pretty sure is due to dryness. This just wasn&#x27;t sure the shampoo for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may work well for other hair + skin types though...</li>
    <li> My husband must wash his hair every day and this is perfect- does not dry out his hair and looks great.</li>
    <li> I have thin, straight, fine, oily, color treated hair...many shampoos leave my hair greasy or flat.  This shampoo cleans my hair without drying it out and stripping my color! It imparts body, it&#x27;s safe and extends the color of my hair. I rated it only with 4 stars because I wish it would give just a bit more body.  The conditioner is great too (may want to use body and shine conditioner if you don&#x27;t have oily hair it adds more moisture).  Usually I can find this shampoo at Rite-Aide, but it is always sold out...so had to buy at Amazon.  You can also purchase it directly at their website along with free shipping with a minimal amount of purchase. Overall I think it&#x27;s a great shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s not too bad, but it definitely didn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;wow\\&quot; factor. My hair was decently soft and healthy, but it definitely did not do what was promised. My advice? Try Loreal Paris&#x27; new products; the EverPure&#x27;s, and whatnot. They&#x27;re amazing! Those products definitely saved my hair. This stuff . . . not so much.</li>
    <li> Like the way Renpure works but I noticed natural carcinogens in it on ewg.org.  I emailed the company many times to no avail.  They obviously don&#x27;t care.  I now use Hugo Naturals which has no toxins in it and works great for my fine hair.  Doesn&#x27;t cost much more either!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used salon products that don&#x27;t measure up to this quality. Great stuff! I have long curly hair and it works wonders!</li>
    <li> This shampoo gives my hair body.  Because my hair is very fine and I have to wash it frequently because I am an aquatics instructor it is not always easy to find just the right shampoo but this one works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Loved this, but couldn&#x27;t get it as part of monthly shipment anymore.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it is organic and cleans my hair so well.  I have had&lt;br /&gt;problems with my scalp and this helps it to stay clean and vibrant.</li>
    <li> The best things about Renpure Organics are the scents and the incredible rebates they offer! If you&#x27;re lucky enough to get bottles with the rebates, you can actually pay NOTHING for these earth- and health-friendly products!</li>
    <li> I saw this at a local grocer, and seeing that it was sulfate and paraben free, as well as in a different though unique bottle, so I decided to give it a try. I will say that I did not mind the texture of the shampoo. This is the volumizing version, and that is not really an issue for me for my hair is in an afro in its natural state, but this was the only version I saw at the store, and I suppose I was not paying attention to the \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; portion. However, this did lather for me. Some mentioned otherwise, but it lathered up for me, at least on my second rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I used this shampoo in the shower, did two washes as I usually do and immediately after the second rinse felt uneasy. Even though my hair was clearly drenched, it felt stripped to me. I did not like the feel at all. It was as if as if all nutrients were taken away from my hair instead of my hair receiving it. It was not soft at all. So afterwards, I conditioned my hair with a different brand, and then deep conditioned with [[ASIN:B004UU05YC Feel It Formula Deep Conditioning Treatment, Box of 12]] (even though the link says box of twelve, I only used one) for an hour, and afterwards my hair felt immensely better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to give this shampoo the benefit of the doubt, for it was a wash directly after I had taken down my hair from extentioned twists (though it should really be irrelevant), but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. I will use it once more since I spent money on it without the added conditioning measures I utilized the first time, but if I come out with the same result I&#x27;m going to have to get rid of it.</li>
