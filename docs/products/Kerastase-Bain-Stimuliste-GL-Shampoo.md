      <li>This shampoo is fantastic, it makes the hair feel clean and full!</li>
      <li>I recently bought Organix bamboo volumizer which works great.</li>
      <li>and I m glad I didn&#x27;t order more since price was reasonable</li>
      <li>I love Kerastase products and use the thickening spray pretty frequently with good results.  </li>
      <li>My hair is shiny and looking really healthy after the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>It is clearly a knock off in very convincing packaging.  </li>
      <li>It is a light shampoo with a low volume of suds so that is probably a good thing.</li>
      <li>and this seller was quick and super easy.</li>
      <li>my scalp started mildly itching.</li>
      <li>I have not discontinued using it, since itching is very mild and I positive effect of product outweigh this discomfort, but it&#x27;s there.</li>
      <li>It is worth the splurge.</li>
      <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
      <li>makes hair soft and shiny and can be easily used every day.</li>
      <li>they are all excellent- a little pricey, but they are pretty concentrated, so they should last you a while.</li>
      <li>They are really reliable, the product gets to California in a week (from London!), and you save the tax.  </li>
      <li>I love it and will definitely be purchasing it again</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the first clue.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just learning to be patient and am happy thinking that I will have my hair line back at a point in the near future.</li>
      <li>The shampoo does seem to help with the overall thickness for fine hair.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is very concentrated</li>
      <li>Neither did much.</li>
      <li>I noticed that with using this, my hair has not been falling out as much.</li>
      <li>my hair seems so much shinier</li>
      <li>Real Kerastase is much thicker in consistency.  </li>
      <li>Real Kerastase leaves my hair feeling thicker and fuller</li>
      <li>I m not sure if the shampoo was old or something because it didn&#x27;t work as it s promised on the bottle and on top of that I lost more hair than normal when I used this shampoo</li>
      <li>It seems to work very well.</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells great and a little goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>but this works alright- more than other products I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>mmmm, nop, this brand and my hair do not get along, it didn&#x27;t make any difference in my hair, it made easily tangle and dry</li>
      <li>Feels like previous formula did a better job</li>
      <li>When I search Internet for the same problem I did not find many complains like this, but I did found another user experiencing same symptoms.</li>
      <li>All the high end salons use Keratase in France.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s high price.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>then normal</li>
      <li>and i need extra conditioning treatment at the end, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>First, the real Kerastase smells different.  </li>
      <li>Next, the texture of the shampoo is much thinner than the real deal.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered from them multiple times, and had consistent experience each time.  </li>
      <li>It might be just my type of skin, but be aware that this unwonted effect is possible.</li>
      <li>I suffered from a really sensitive scalp - for the longest time</li>
      <li>After shampoo, it&#x27;s soft and silky, and shiny.  </li>
      <li>The only way to ensure you are getting the real deal is by purchasing direct from a salon or directly from the Kerastase website.  </li>
      <li>People ask me all the time what I use for my hair, because at 50, I have the hair of a 20 year old.</li>
      <li>So far the product has met my expectations.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good quality and fast shipping love this seller</li>
    <li> I found this to be too drying (both hair and scalp) for my thinning, fine hair.  I was hoping to find a product that was less greasy than Wen but still moisturizing.  Now I am mixing the two together until I run out and still need to find one product that works as promised.</li>
    <li> This is the best product on the market for fine hair.....amazing  I love it and will definitely be purchasing it again</li>
    <li> GREAT SHAMPOO FOR THINNING HAIR....BEST PRICE EVER!</li>
    <li> This is a great product like all kerastase. makes hair soft and shiny and can be easily used every day. and this seller was quick and super easy.</li>
    <li> Did not notice a difference in my hair.  Too expensive to justify purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I love Kerastase products and use the thickening spray pretty frequently with good results.  However, I&#x27;m very disappointed in this shampoo.  It made my hair limp and made my hair noticeably thinner.</li>
    <li> This product does not work at all.  It&#x27;s expensive and only lasts less than two months.  Nothing like the ad says</li>
    <li> Not sure if it really works. only been using for 2 weeks.  i&#x27;ll give it more time to see if it helps.</li>
    <li> bought second time, like its smell</li>
    <li> I have been using it for several weeks and my hair loss continues at the same rate. It is a light shampoo with a low volume of suds so that is probably a good thing. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair worse but it isn&#x27;t any better than the Nexus product I was using previously and this is much more expensive.</li>
    <li> Lots of my hair still fell off. And really bad smell.</li>
    <li> the product is of excellent quality and highly recommended is adequate and very good, comfortable, quiet, and friendly, everyone who wants one product of its kind highly recommend it without problems.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this shampoo to me after I developed a couple of thin spots near my temples. The shampoo does seem to help with the overall thickness for fine hair.</li>
    <li> mmmm, nop, this brand and my hair do not get along, it didn&#x27;t make any difference in my hair, it made easily tangle and dry</li>
    <li> I like it. Feels like previous formula did a better job but this works alright- more than other products I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> I started using it and although my hair got better look almost immediately my scalp started mildly itching. When I search Internet for the same problem I did not find many complains like this, but I did found another user experiencing same symptoms. It might be just my type of skin, but be aware that this unwonted effect is possible. I have never got this type of problem with any other shampoo I have used so this is definitely attributed to my use of Kerastase. I have not discontinued using it, since itching is very mild and I positive effect of product outweigh this discomfort, but it&#x27;s there.</li>
    <li> Best Shampoo I ever used. It is well worth the price. It even stopped me dandruff issues. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It does make my hair feel thicker but I still need to use a conditioner with it. This survey is a pain  for making me use so many words and a headline</li>
    <li> Good product.  Someone suggested it to me since my hair has been falling out after I had the baby.  I noticed that with using this, my hair has not been falling out as much.</li>
    <li> Just read today that Kerastase is also the favorite of Princess Kate. However, I am 61 and this does great on my hair!</li>
    <li> This product does all it says it will do! My hair looks and feels so nice. I do condition it a tiny bit after shampooing because of the cold dry air and static elec. You only need a drop of cond.. This shampoo is very concentrated you only need a little. This bottle should last a while.</li>
    <li> I have been using Keratase products since I lived in France in the mid-eighties.  All the high end salons use Keratase in France.  It saved my hair!  The Keratase Solaire line is great for the summer if you&#x27;re in the pool a lot or in the ocean.  I can&#x27;t say enough about these products.  People ask me all the time what I use for my hair, because at 50, I have the hair of a 20 year old.</li>
    <li> Well, although it does not work in the first week or month, I think it is ok! Deeper evaluation after some months.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Adds tons of volume which I need bc my hair tends to fall flat. Be sure to use a moisturizing conditioner.</li>
    <li> I always gets it I love it</li>
    <li> I m not sure if the shampoo was old or something because it didn&#x27;t work as it s promised on the bottle and on top of that I lost more hair than normal when I used this shampoo and I m glad I didn&#x27;t order more since price was reasonable and I don&#x27;t recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for thinning hair.  I bought this for my husband and it helps restore his hair&#x27;s thickness and fullness.  Only a small amount of product is needed so this bottle lasts a long time. Will definitely keep repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that this shampoo was to volumize the hair.  It doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s more of a conditioning shampoo. Has a great scent and works well in that capacity.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a while.  My hair looks and feels really healthy.  After shampoo, it&#x27;s soft and silky, and shiny.  I use it in combination with Kerastase Nutri Thermique conditioner and Nectar Thermique heat protector  The heat protector I use after toweling my hair, then apply it.  I was never big on &#x27; too much product,&#x27; but this combination doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.30.14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still love it, and haven&#x27;t found anything else to compare to it. Each time I&#x27;ve attempted to switch shampoos, I go back to this one.  FYI: it&#x27;s typically available via Amazon through Neon and Noble in London.  They are really reliable, the product gets to California in a week (from London!), and you save the tax.  I&#x27;ve ordered from them multiple times, and had consistent experience each time.  I just ordered 2 more bottles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11.12.14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... I&#x27;m still using it, and it continues to be great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> So far the product has met my expectations. My hair appears thicker; the product smells amazing; and it feels good. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see a major difference, but so far the product line (as I also use the sculpting paste) is incredible.</li>
    <li> So far, have only used a few times,  in rotation with other shampoos I have. Don&#x27;t particularly care for the scent, a little too powdery. As a shampoo, seems to be fine. Don&#x27;t think I would buy again, unless, when I finish the bottle, my hair has some grand transformation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due exclusively to the shampoo, as i also changed my diet introducing more green vegetables, but i noticed less hair in the drain! Very happy with it. I have 4 stars because the shampoo leaves my hair a little dry and i need extra conditioning treatment at the end, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I wish I used it everytime</li>
    <li> This did nothing for my hair. I also bought the after shampoo volumizer to spray in before blow drying. Neither did much. THe products weren&#x27;t greasy so that was good but I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my short hair. Not worth the money. I recently bought Organix bamboo volumizer which works great. And it&#x27;s less than 1/3 the cost of this product.</li>
    <li> My hair loss has minimize since using this product along with the conditioner. Love it</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo. Specially for poor hair .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month i haven&#x27;t seen any big results but i think its slowly working.</li>
    <li> love this along the rest of the system works amazing my hair seems so much shinier then normal I would recommend this</li>
    <li> Kerastase products are excellent quality, they are perfect for my fine thin hair that is also straight.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is one of the best I have ever used. My hair is shiny and looking really healthy after the first time I used it. I bought it because my mom already had excellent results with it. Her stylist at her hair salon recommended it to her.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is fantastic, it makes the hair feel clean and full! I love it because my hair doesn&#x27;t get oily as easy after washing it!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and a good price</li>
    <li> The product is similar to Kerastase Bain Preventive Shampoo plus Kerastase Stimuliste after shampoo, is total prevention of losing hair. I strongly recommend to whoever !</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this. It seems to work very well.</li>
    <li> I see less hair falling.  This shampoo smells great and a little goes a long way.  It is worth the splurge.</li>
    <li> I did not receive my Product. I received the package but only the book was there, no shampoo was in it</li>
    <li> Keratase, amazing product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already reviewed another kerastase product- they are all excellent- a little pricey, but they are pretty concentrated, so they should last you a while. I have a full, thick head of hair, so I use this in conjunction with two other kerastase products to prevent hair loss, as I&#x27;m now 48.&lt;br /&gt;I have a top-notch hair stylist, and he swears to me kerastase is light years ahead of any other hair care line. You WILL notice a  difference when using these products- your hair will be thicker, shinier, and don&#x27;t be surprised if people start asking you \\&quot;what are you doing different?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as I&#x27;ve said in a review of another kerastase product, if you are already slick bald or close, THERE IS NO PRODUCT out there that is going to save you. If they say so, they are snake oil salesmen that just want your money. If  you are slick bald or have serious hair loss issues, I&#x27;m afraid you will have to go to Bosley for a hair transplant, which ain&#x27;t cheap my friends. But, if you have the money, and your hair loss issues are getting the best of you, then by all means, just do it and make yourself happy!&lt;br /&gt;I have used numerous other shampoos and hair care products over the years, and I have never found anything that compares to Kerastase. I get compliments on my hair all the time- and who doesn&#x27;t like compliments? I had thick hair before, but now- it&#x27;s insane how thick it is. A good problem to have I suppose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this 2 weeks but already I can see and feel a difference in my hair.  WAY less hair going down the drain and my hair just looks a bit fuller and definitely healthier!  Love it!</li>
    <li> My husband and I both did a lot of research after I noticed my hair seemed to have thinned and S-L-O-W-L-Y started growing back near my temples and forehead at my side part. This, I have concluded, is due to genetics, hormones, stress, horrible shampoos, or a combination of them all. I do not dye my hair or treat it in any way, so as a 30 year old, this was scaring the crap out of me and causing me some anxiety... Which in turn probably didn&#x27;t do well for the thinning hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband found Keratase Bain Stimuliste via the internet, and despite our strict budget, said I should splurge and get this product because of the reviews he read. I stopped in at my local Gene Juarez and talked with a women who works there. She said she has been using this product and it has helped with her post-pregnancy hairloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using this product for about four months, and I have to say it&#x27;s simply...wonderful! My hair doesn&#x27;t grow very fast, but the hair that was thinning at my hair line is finally getting longer and actually is not so blantently thinning. I&#x27;m impressed and happy with it, even if I don&#x27;t have the most IMMEDIATE results. I&#x27;m just learning to be patient and am happy thinking that I will have my hair line back at a point in the near future. In addition, my hair does not fall out as easily as it had in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be continuing to use this product despite it&#x27;s high price. One bottle DOES last a good three months for me (as others have stated, it&#x27;s fairly concentrated). All in all, it&#x27;s a great product that I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had hair shedding issues for about two months and tried various shampoos and this is the one I like the best.  It seemed to slow the hair shedding a bit, but the main reason I like it is the volume it gives my hair and the way it makes my scalp feel - just cleaner than other soaps.  Plus, my hair seems softer than with other shampoos for hair thinning.</li>
    <li> This is NOT Kerastase shampoo.  It is clearly a knock off in very convincing packaging.  First, the real Kerastase smells different.  That&#x27;s the first clue.  Next, the texture of the shampoo is much thinner than the real deal.  Real Kerastase is much thicker in consistency.  Finally, this stuff left my hear feeling dull and thin.  Real Kerastase leaves my hair feeling thicker and fuller which is why I pay $40/bottle for it.  I should have known better just based on the price and after a few shampoos with this stuff after my salon purchased bottle ran out, I talked with my stylist and she said that fake Kerastase was pretty common actually.  The only way to ensure you are getting the real deal is by purchasing direct from a salon or directly from the Kerastase website.  That said, I want to be perfectly clear that I don&#x27;t have any indication that the seller is knowingly shipping fake Kerastase and, in fact, I feel bad for them as they probably have no idea. Based on the ease of my order and shipping time, I would still recommend the seller just not this product.  Remember, you get what you pay for and the bargain is not worth it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best thing that has ever happened for my scalp.  I suffered from a really sensitive scalp - for the longest time I could not use anything at all. I have tried many other products and each one made my scalp unbearably itchy and painful. I tried everything, then one day I was getting a haircut and my barber suggested this as he had the same issues. When I tried It I thought this would be like everything else - but I was completely wrong. I order a bottle of this every 1-2 months for the past 9 months and have had no issues at all. It has strengthened my hair and promoted some hair growth (not an extreme amount, but enough for my fiancé to notice). I would recommend this product and will use this as long as they make it - I will never switch again ha-ha.</li>
