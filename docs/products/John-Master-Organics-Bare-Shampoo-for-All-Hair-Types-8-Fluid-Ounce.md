### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Truly unscented, perfect for those of us allergic to perfume.  </li>
      <li>great shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It is a good product</li>
      <li>I liked that this product is organic.</li>
      <li>But I can&#x27;t tell that I really liked my hair after using it.</li>
      <li>And the bottle looks nice in the bathroom.</li>
      <li>Also happens to be a nice shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It suds well and does a good job cleaning my hair and most of all no fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I have bought this with both pregnancies as I am very sensitive to smells and fragrance and this is the best shampoo.</li>
      <li>Very light feeling but cleansing as well.  </li>
      <li>and it seems like most have it.</li>
      <li>Cheers to John masters for making a quality chemical free unscented shampoo that works!</li>
      <li>It does seem to be more drying than the others.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s better for my skin.</li>
      <li>So glad to find it on amazon…..</li>
      <li>However, it is better to my hair compared some hair care products I have used.</li>
      <li>I love the JM line.</li>
      <li>When I use this, I feel my hair is more smooth than before.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice mild shampoo that really works.  </li>
      <li>Good shampoo; one of the best on the market for the health-conscious aiming to avoid unnecessary chemicals in their hair care routine.</li>
      <li>I get good results for my natural blonde/greying hair along&lt;</li>
      <li>real unscented shampoo !!!</li>
      <li>Nothing special...</li>
      <li>and so it tends to get used up quickly.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair in good shape - not too oily, not too dry.  </li>
      <li>Wow!!!!!</li>
      <li>I have tried several fragrance free shampoos and this is a favorite.  </li>
      <li>No strong order from this, AND it lathers will amazing!</li>
      <li>They have a larger bottle available on their home site; I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s available on Amazon or not.</li>
      <li>Dislike both very much, though there are some benefits - like shinier hair and organic ingredients.  </li>
      <li>But, other than that it is great with the all natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>More than I thought possible.  </li>
      <li>After using this product out of desperation, it helped clear my scalp right up!</li>
      <li>In a market full of disappointing natural hair care products, This a truly great unscented shampoo!</li>
      <li>I wanted so much to like this line</li>
      <li>They can only have unscented products, and this fit that ticket.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, it works well.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I wanted an all natural shampoo.</li>
      <li>It left my hair feeling very soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
      <li>My only complaint would be that there isn&#x27;t more in the bottle (needs to be a larger quantity).  </li>
      <li>If you find your hair difficult to manage, doing its own thing try this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Hair was clean and shiney and not weighed down or dry looking.  </li>
      <li>It does has a very very faint scent, almost citrusy, it&#x27;s still pleasant.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like this shampoo as much as the other John Masters options.</li>

<li> The bottle was much smaller than I expected</li>
<li> This is expensive shampoo, but it lathers very well and just a little dollop really cleans my long hair, with no residual itchiness - like big box shelf shampoos.</li>
<li> and this doesn&#x27;t dry it out at all.</li>
<li> The Lavendar conditioner leaves no fragrance at all once dry.  </li>
<li> I have very dry hair</li>
<li> And as I said with the conditioner, it is SCARY how much hair I&#x27;ve lost since starting with Masters!</li>
<li> A pricepoint at 60% less would still be expensive, but worth considering.</li>
<li> unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
<li> Only complaint is the bottle is a little on the small side</li>
<li> It actually cleans your hair without leaving any build up or residue behind.</li>
<li> While a small amount seems to do the job, I can&#x27;t afford this.  </li>
<li> you have to use a lot which means I will probably only get a month or so of use out of this small, expensive bottle.</li>
<li> I bought this at Ulta, not amazon, although next time I&#x27;ll probably buy it on amazon because it&#x27;s cheaper, but I was desperate for a shampoo and conditioner.</li>
<li> Other organic shampoos I&#x27;ve tried said they were unscented but smelled bad anyway.</li>
<li> Bad smell， not useful</li>
<li> It is really expensive.</li>
<li> The shampoo leaves my hair smelling dirty by the time it dries!  </li>

    <li> This is expensive shampoo, but it lathers very well and just a little dollop really cleans my long hair, with no residual itchiness - like big box shelf shampoos.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t suds as well as traditional shampoos but it&#x27;s better for my skin. I like that it&#x27;s not scented either. If you have sensitive skin, it works well.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Ulta, not amazon, although next time I&#x27;ll probably buy it on amazon because it&#x27;s cheaper, but I was desperate for a shampoo and conditioner. I have tried SEVERAL and believe me when I say several shampoos and conditioners. Organic, not organic, claiming to be unscented etc. and this the ONLY one I&#x27;ve had luck with. It actually IS unscented. No strong order from this, AND it lathers will amazing! Other organic shampoos I&#x27;ve tried said they were unscented but smelled bad anyway. Plus this has no citric acid which is great for me because I get these weird red dots behind my ears when I use shampoos/conditioners with citric acid and it seems like most have it. It left my hair feeling very soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars.</li>
    <li> In a market full of disappointing natural hair care products, This a truly great unscented shampoo! Cheers to John masters for making a quality chemical free unscented shampoo that works!</li>

    <li> Wow!!!!! great shampoo.  More than I thought possible.  If you find your hair difficult to manage, doing its own thing try this shampoo.</li>
    <li> After a long time I figured out that I had been having an allergic reaction to my regular shampoo, turns out I&#x27;m allergic to eucalyptus and well everything else. After using this product out of desperation, it helped clear my scalp right up! It does has a very very faint scent, almost citrusy, it&#x27;s still pleasant. I have very dry hair and this doesn&#x27;t dry it out at all.</li>
    <li> It suds well and does a good job cleaning my hair and most of all no fragrance.  It is a good product</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo during my pregnancy...Nothing special... I liked that this product is organic. But I can&#x27;t tell that I really liked my hair after using it. I just simply didn&#x27;t have time to search for a different product.</li>
    <li> Truly unscented, perfect for those of us allergic to perfume.  Also happens to be a nice shampoo.  Leaves my hair in good shape - not too oily, not too dry.  And the bottle looks nice in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I have tried several fragrance free shampoos and this is a favorite.  I get good results for my natural blonde/greying hair along&lt;br /&gt;with a bit of styling mousse and another brand&#x27;s conditioner that I have.  So glad to find it on amazon…..</li>
    <li> This is a very nice mild shampoo that really works.  My only complaint would be that there isn&#x27;t more in the bottle (needs to be a larger quantity).  I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this shampoo as much as the other John Masters options. It does seem to be more drying than the others. I have a short pixie cut and I don&#x27;t use conditioner, so I need a shampoo that is non-drying. But, other than that it is great with the all natural ingredients. I love the JM line.</li>
    <li> Bad smell， not useful</li>
    <li> It is really expensive. However, it is better to my hair compared some hair care products I have used. When I use this, I feel my hair is more smooth than before.</li>
    <li> I have bought this with both pregnancies as I am very sensitive to smells and fragrance and this is the best shampoo. It actually cleans your hair without leaving any build up or residue behind.</li>
    <li> Please see my review of the John Masters Organic Lavendar &amp; Avocado Intensive Conditioner - I used these 2 together.  Dislike both very much, though there are some benefits - like shinier hair and organic ingredients.  I wanted so much to like this line but... yeow! Not at all.  The shampoo leaves my hair smelling dirty by the time it dries!  The Lavendar conditioner leaves no fragrance at all once dry.  And as I said with the conditioner, it is SCARY how much hair I&#x27;ve lost since starting with Masters!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad to have found a shampoo that does not make my head itch, but I think this is too expensive for me to buy again.  The bottle was much smaller than I expected (I did not check the ounce designation).  While a small amount seems to do the job, I can&#x27;t afford this.  A pricepoint at 60% less would still be expensive, but worth considering.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted an all natural shampoo. unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work very well. you have to use a lot which means I will probably only get a month or so of use out of this small, expensive bottle. definitely trying something else next time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my granddaughter to take with her when she entered the Army. They can only have unscented products, and this fit that ticket.</li>
    <li> real unscented shampoo !!!</li>
    <li> Very light feeling but cleansing as well.  Hair was clean and shiney and not weighed down or dry looking.  I will continue to use it.</li>
