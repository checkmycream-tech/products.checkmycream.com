      <li>This is such an awesome nail polish!</li>
      <li>This product was more of a metallic chrome.</li>
      <li>I am more than pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I love, love, love this color.  </li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>The product was ok</li>
      <li>Love the color</li>
      <li>Dries quickly and looks amazing on the nail.</li>
      <li>as I thought...chips easily</li>
      <li>It a cool color &amp; all my friends love it</li>
      <li>Work quickly if using it for stamping!</li>
      <li>It is a  light, shiny silver.</li>
      <li>I love Essie brand nail polish because of the bright and vibrant colors they offer, the &amp;#34;No Place Like Chrome&amp;#34; nail polish is my favorite color by far.</li>
      <li>easy to apply, drying time is quick.</li>
      <li>It only takes 1 coat and it goes on very smooth and nicely.  </li>
      <li>it was nothing special.</li>
      <li>As with all nail polishes, it comes off pretty easily, but nothing a touch up can&#x27;t fix.</li>
      <li>I was wanting more of a high glossy chrome.</li>
      <li>My new favorite polish</li>
      <li>Overall it is nice, but not what I was hoping for.  </li>
      <li>Either way, if you&#x27;re spending 5 dollars on Amazon vs. 8 dollars going to the store, this purchase is worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun</li>
      <li>It applies thick, which is good, but it makes some lines instead of a smooth surface.</li>
      <li>Plus the color really looks like chrome!</li>
      <li>This is my first purchase of an Essie nail polish.</li>
      <li>It really makes your nails look futuristic and metallic!</li>
      <li>I need to order more because I am totally going to run out.  </li>
      <li>Reasonably priced!</li>
      <li>Most polishes fell short but this one is thick enough to look great on my nails without applying a zillion coats!</li>
      <li>The metallic collection is very shiny; this color is silver like the Tin Man, very unusual and gets a lot of notice and compliments</li>
      <li>Dries really fast too.</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t spend that much on nail polish.</li>
      <li>Using a top coat with the polish will extend it a little longer, but not by much.</li>
      <li>Kind of like you glued the dull side of aluminum foil on your fingers.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast, exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
      <li>The color is long lasting and it dries pretty fast.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments so far.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m conflicted with this seller, because I really do love their lacquer colors, but the wear is just not good.</li>
      <li>Dries fast, not stinky like other metalics I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I bought this for stamping, and it works well though it dries a little fast.</li>

    <li> Essie products are awesome...LOVE THIS MATTALLIC GRAY!!!</li>
    <li> The metallic collection is very shiny; this color is silver like the Tin Man, very unusual and gets a lot of notice and compliments</li>
    <li> It applies thick, which is good, but it makes some lines instead of a smooth surface. But good color, and brush is nice</li>
    <li> This product was more of a metallic chrome. I was wanting more of a high glossy chrome. Served the purpose, last as long as any other nail polish. Arrived expeditiously.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this color.  I need to order more because I am totally going to run out.  It&#x27;s fun and i always get compliments.</li>
    <li> It did not have the mirror effect I was looking for however, the polish lasted for over a week and still looked nice!!!!  Goes on very smooth.</li>
    <li> I used this as a tip for the Romper Room polish. It&#x27;s a different look and I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this for stamping, and it works well though it dries a little fast. Work quickly if using it for stamping! It also does give one coat coverage for painting your nails, though I recommend two or three to minimize brush strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do a swatch on a piece of tape and tape it to the cap... The color in the bottle does not reflect the color on your nails well...  the picture on this listing of it in the bottle does not do it justice at all! It is a  light, shiny silver.</li>
    <li> Was trying to find mirror nail polish, this is looks like metallic finish, not the mirror finish I was looking for, still looking :(</li>
    <li> not shiny chrome like I thought....didn&#x27;t stay on as well as I thought...chips easily</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a nail polish that has a shiny metallic look. Most polishes fell short but this one is thick enough to look great on my nails without applying a zillion coats! Very Happy !</li>
    <li> So nice to ware and it looks good too. I am waring it now while I typing this. Love this color! Dries really fast too.</li>
    <li> I completely love this color, it is exactly as it looks a metallic silver, its beautiful! I also have the &amp;#34;good as gold&amp;#34; from this collection! Perfect!</li>
    <li> It a cool color &amp; all my friends love it</li>
    <li> My new favorite polish</li>
    <li> This is a nice chrome color. Recommend to flare the polish look.&lt;br /&gt;Difficult on the nail.&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared to pamper your nail after.</li>
    <li> The person who I bought this for off of their &amp;#34;wishlist&amp;#34; was very appreciative of the gift and very happy to receive it. It was for their birthday.</li>
    <li> The product was ok it was nothing special. It Was not different from any other polish that I already had.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this nail polish! Dries quickly and looks amazing on the nail. Kind of like you glued the dull side of aluminum foil on your fingers. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is my first purchase of an Essie nail polish. I&#x27;ve heard good things about it - but with a retail value of 8 dollars I just don&#x27;t spend that much on nail polish. I decided to look on amazon for a silver nail polish due to my daughter getting into my silver &amp; in desperation of looking for another one, I came across Essie&#x27;s No Place Like Chrome. It was actually one of the cheapest here on Amazon with me paying a total of 5 dollars for it. Cheaper than the retail price, you can&#x27;t beat that! Upon arriving here I just had to try it out. Let me say the silver is amazing &amp; bright. It truly lives up to the name No Place Like Chrome. As with all nail polishes, it comes off pretty easily, but nothing a touch up can&#x27;t fix. Either way, if you&#x27;re spending 5 dollars on Amazon vs. 8 dollars going to the store, this purchase is worth it.</li>
    <li> Love this color!  Reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> Great color. easy to apply, drying time is quick.</li>
    <li> I love Essie brand nail polish because of the bright and vibrant colors they offer, the &amp;#34;No Place Like Chrome&amp;#34; nail polish is my favorite color by far. However, I swear that this polish will not last a week on my nails. It begins to rub off (not chip off) my nails the 2nd day of wear. Using a top coat with the polish will extend it a little longer, but not by much. I&#x27;m conflicted with this seller, because I really do love their lacquer colors, but the wear is just not good.</li>
    <li> This is such an awesome nail polish! I love it.  It only takes 1 coat and it goes on very smooth and nicely.  Plus the color really looks like chrome! I am more than pleased with it. It really makes your nails look futuristic and metallic!</li>
    <li> Dries fast, not stinky like other metalics I&#x27;ve tried. Lasts about a week. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who likes very bright polish.</li>
    <li> good quality, but did not like the way it looked on me.</li>
    <li> What I expected. Love the color</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a mirror finish, as I had seen somebody post photos of such online.  This will not give that polished of a finish, but it is a very bright silver color.  Overall it is nice, but not what I was hoping for.  I&#x27;m giving it away.</li>
    <li> What I couldn&#x27;t find in stores, I found here. Shipped fast, exactly what I expected it to be. Love it!</li>
    <li> If you like metallic, this is the collection for you! I would purchase this again! Looks great on the toes!</li>
    <li> Essie make a great brand of polish. The color is long lasting and it dries pretty fast. You cannot go wrong with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love the color, but unfortunately unlike other essie colors, the chrome seemed to chip in a day or two...even with a topcoat applied.</li>
