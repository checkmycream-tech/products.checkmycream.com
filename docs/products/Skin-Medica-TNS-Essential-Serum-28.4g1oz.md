      <li>I love TNS serum, but I would never buy from this seller again.</li>
      <li>The SkinMedica TNS got rid of my brown spots on my face and my skin is more even toned and smoother.</li>

      <li>I love this product, when it is genuine and fresh.</li>
      <li>I love this product, you can really feel your skin tightening.</li>
      <li>Saves a ton of money vs buying at full price.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if that is true of every company, but I felt the product performed as well as</li>
      <li>Skin Medica TNS Serum is absolutely, hands down the best serum I have used.  </li>
      <li>Skin Medica TNS Essential Serum is a wonderful product to be used daily after cleansing and toning one&#x27;s skin.</li>
      <li>This product was fresh which was ordered from oxom.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I was able to return the product and went back to my TNS and my Caudalie moisturizer.</li>
      <li>pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>price is right.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to pay the price and get the right Serum</li>
      <li>You can feel it with the first use but takes a few weeks to see great results.  </li>
      <li>I use only the very best skin care products and was really surprised to get a quality cream like this at such a reasonable price!  </li>
      <li>If I am wrong and someone can explain how I can tell that this product is authentic, I am happy to listen.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for over a year now and have, for the first time in my life, been receiving unsolicited compliments on my skin.  </li>
      <li>not only the pump is a problem but many times it has been rejected&lt;br /&gt;by spa&#x27;s&lt;</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks so much!</li>
      <li>This stuff really works !</li>
      <li>Goes in smoothly, odorless, skin feels soft and hydrated.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this my entire life, LOVE this stuff....</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this powerful product.</li>
      <li>I will certainly shop through Amazon again when i am ready for a refill</li>
      <li>This product is working very well, and have seen a difference in wrinkle reduction.  </li>
      <li>when it is real.  </li>
      <li>I also do not think the product I buy through Amazon is the real thing.  </li>
      <li>I am very concerned that this is a knock-off product.  </li>
      <li>Of course clinic wants to say it &amp;#34;could&amp;#34; be expired product</li>
      <li>but I found this to be the real thing.  </li>
      <li>Not a lot more than my other regime of products from my skin clinic.</li>
      <li>It is true with this product that the white cream portion was a little more yellow in color than the one I had originally purchased directly from my dermatologist.  </li>
      <li>Price is high though for the amount contained in the bottle.  </li>
      <li>Originally recommended by my dermatologist, I&#x27;ve ordered this before so am not new to this product.</li>
      <li>After having my make up done by her I decided to give it a try and purchased the complete line of oroducts at a very hefty price tag.</li>
      <li>I look years younger and rarely can anyone guess my age.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought TNS Essential Serum at my doctor&#x27;s office for full price and this one is exactly the same.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without this Serum - Have been using it for years</li>
      <li>Skin has changed dramatically after 3 months of use - smooth, less spots, and well moisturized.  </li>
      <li>I can tell by whether the cream product is either pure white or discolored somewhat.</li>
      <li>There is a substantial difference in price if I order it directly from SkinMedica.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve never used the real thing -- actually purchased from a doctor&#x27;s office or the manufacturer -- you may not notice the difference.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and it has really improved my skin texture.  </li>
      <li>The white cream portion is brown and has an unusual odor.</li>
      <li>I am 40 years old and after trying it I will never be without</li>
      <li>When they do they are always surprised.  </li>
      <li>So if you have trouble even at first, try this first before thinking the product is defective.</li>
      <li>Almost instant improvement in skin texture, filled in a hollow on my cheek, overall even toned and smoother complexion.</li>
      <li>Usually it seems to be the light brown.</li>
      <li>Within 2 weeks my skin was back to normal again.</li>
      <li>However on the last shipment the product on the right  was 1/2 EMPTY...</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Skin Medica Essential Serum for younger looking skin.</li>
      <li>, I am 56 years old and have been using Skin Medica for several years - i wouldn&#x27;t try anything else on my skin again.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like to waste money and this product is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>It has an odd smell, but that is how you know its real!</li>
      <li>and it makes a profound difference in skin tone, and definitely minimizes wrinkles</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the cost is worth it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this serum. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> My wife used if for years and her face is beautiful people think she is 45 years old!&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s not even close. So I decided I would try !  I&#x27;m a rancher out in the wind and weather all day. Tough on skin!&lt;br /&gt;My wife started saying how nice my face looked. The only downside is it is expensive</li>
    <li> Great, great, great great great.  Swell, swell, swell and then some  nine more words required and I don&#x27;t think I will ever to this again.</li>
    <li> Goes in smoothly, odorless, skin feels soft and hydrated. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the container: the pump fails occasionally and one cannot tell when the product is running out.</li>
    <li> The product is defective. I was warned about this. It is supposed to be two different serums that when pumped can be mixed into one. Only one is of the two serums is present. Rip off.</li>
    <li> Have tried other si&lt;br /&gt;Liar products but always go back to TNS Essential Serum.</li>
    <li> I ordered Skinmedica TNS Essential Serum from Skincare Perfection.  The product arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I believe this is the best anti-aging cream on the market and the price I received was excellent.  I am recommending this company and product to everyone I know!  I use only the very best skin care products and was really surprised to get a quality cream like this at such a reasonable price!  If you want to turn the clock back try this for at least 90 days and see what you think!</li>
    <li> Of course clinic wants to say it &amp;#34;could&amp;#34; be expired product but I found this to be the real thing.  Thank you for offering at the cost you posted!</li>
    <li> Skin Medica TNS Serum is absolutely, hands down the best serum I have used.  Since I have been using it people I don&#x27;t even know tell me how beautiful my skin looks.  You can feel it with the first use but takes a few weeks to see great results.  I have stopped using botox!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results. I&#x27;ve been using for a month now and have seen no change.  Maybe I need to use&lt;br /&gt;Got a longer time.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple years and when I was visiting a friend in Atlanta I was approached by a Neiman Marcus Dior representative and she wanted me to try the L&#x27;OR DEVIE line of products. After having my make up done by her I decided to give it a try and purchased the complete line of oroducts at a very hefty price tag. I was told it would last a year and that made it abou $100 per month. Not a lot more than my other regime of products from my skin clinic. I used the program religiously for four months and my face started breaking out and felt very rough over this time. Fortunately, I was able to return the product and went back to my TNS and my Caudalie moisturizer. Within 2 weeks my skin was back to normal again. I have purchased TNS from online companies and I do check to make sure the product works and is the light cream color and packaging is sealed. There are no expiration dates so I called the company and talked to the receptionist and was told this was from a Dermatologist office and they were volume buyers and that is how they could sell at a discount. I don&#x27;t know if that is true of every company, but I felt the product performed as well as my retail source and they told me a little secret about when the product gets low, take the pump top off and there are two valves that dispense each color product. Just press each one separately to get the product to come out evenly. So if you have trouble even at first, try this first before thinking the product is defective.</li>
    <li> Best product for wrinkle elimination.  Price is high though for the amount contained in the bottle.  Perhaps the manufacturer can improve the product cost in the future.</li>
    <li> A lot of money for a little product.  Lasted less than 3 weeks. Too little time to see any results.  Pump didn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
    <li> This product is working very well, and have seen a difference in wrinkle reduction.  You do need to press down evenly to get both the cream and the gel to come out at the same rate.  I will continue to purchase</li>
    <li> I use this product line daily.  I am 51 years old with absolutely no lines or wrinkles. Reversed forehead lines.</li>
    <li> This item is faulty. It is suppose to contain two solutions that you mix then apply. It only has the cream colored solution dispensing. I have used this product for years and have never had this problem. I have been out of the country and was going contact you on my returrn.</li>
    <li> Its a great product for antiaging. I save about $100 by ordering it on Amazon versus buying through my salon.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and I get compliments on my face all the time.  I look years younger and rarely can anyone guess my age.  When they do they are always surprised.  I highly recommend this powerful product.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in perfect condition.  I called Skin Medica to find out manufacture date/expiration date.  The product was recently manufactured, and had an expiration date that was 18 months in the future.  I am VERY PLEASED with this purchase, and will be a return customer!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product . . . when it is real.  I am very concerned that this is a knock-off product.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think Amazon does anything to monitor counterfeit product and it is up to reviewers to comment.  If you&#x27;ve never used the real thing -- actually purchased from a doctor&#x27;s office or the manufacturer -- you may not notice the difference.  However, there was less product than advertised, the pump didn&#x27;t work properly, and the product just didn&#x27;t seem the same.  I&#x27;d rather pay the extra money and know that I&#x27;m getting what I pay for.  If I am wrong and someone can explain how I can tell that this product is authentic, I am happy to listen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and it has really improved my skin texture.  My wrinkles are reduced and my complexion seems lighter and more even.</li>
    <li> I so Love this product!!!!!  it is the only Serum I use . However on the last shipment the product on the right  was 1/2 EMPTY...Puzzled ...WHY?? I order this all the time.</li>
    <li> Not doing for me what I hoped it would.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only on my second purchase of this product.  I like it, and will continue use because of the good reviews.  Haven&#x27;t notice a real big difference yet</li>
    <li> The SkinMedica TNS got rid of my brown spots on my face and my skin is more even toned and smoother.</li>
    <li> I love this product, you can really feel your skin tightening. I use it with my Clarisonic Opal which helps the product sink in through the skin layers. I highly recommend Skin Medica Essential Serum for younger looking skin.</li>
    <li> This is liquid gold for the face. I am 40 years old and after trying it I will never be without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks so much!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works ! pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> The only face cream you need</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to buy this product online but I am very satisfied with this product and will continue to purchase from this company!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without the amazing product! The one staple in my skin care regimen!!</li>
    <li> Love this product...the longer you use it the results go beyond expectations.</li>
    <li> I love this product, when it is genuine and fresh. From this seller, I received a unit that seems &amp;#34;spoiled.&amp;#34; The dispenser does not work (I did all the usual things, tapping it upside down, etc.) but it just dribbles out and collects under the cap. The white cream portion is brown and has an unusual odor. I&#x27;ve used the product for years, so I know what it&#x27;s supposed to look like and how the dispenser works. I love TNS serum, but I would never buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Best product on the market</li>
    <li> Have been using the TNS Essential Serum for quite some time now and I absolutely love it-</li>
    <li> Skin has changed dramatically after 3 months of use - smooth, less spots, and well moisturized.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this my entire life, LOVE this stuff....and the rest of Skin Medica&#x27;s products!</li>
    <li> Skin Medica TNS Essential Serum is a wonderful product to be used daily after cleansing and toning one&#x27;s skin.</li>
    <li> Originally recommended by my dermatologist, I&#x27;ve ordered this before so am not new to this product. If you want to see a change in the overall texture and plumpness of your skin, this is the product. It has an odd smell, but that is how you know its real!</li>
    <li> Almost instant improvement in skin texture, filled in a hollow on my cheek, overall even toned and smoother complexion. Extremely expensive but worth the price.</li>
    <li> Very expensive, but recommended by my dermatologist... so I&#x27;m giving it a try for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  in regards to yellow color of the creme portion.  It is true with this product that the white cream portion was a little more yellow in color than the one I had originally purchased directly from my dermatologist.  However, I called up SkinMedica and verified this bottle has a good expiration date (expires in june of 2015).....  so that&#x27;s really good.  The lady on the phone verified it was a genuine product.  Also she said the color can vary a little just depending on the formulation, or possibly how the product was stored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to keep buying these on Amazon.  Saves a ton of money vs buying at full price.</li>
    <li> this is one off the best products for your face.  One pump in the morning and one pump at night will give you amazing skin.  The product make you look younger in just a few months of using.  Gives you smooth beautiful skin.  Stay out of the sun and you will look amazing!  Remember the sun is not your friend...it breaks down collegen making your face droopy and aged!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this Serum - Have been using it for years and it makes a profound difference in skin tone, and definitely minimizes wrinkles, I am 56 years old and have been using Skin Medica for several years - i wouldn&#x27;t try anything else on my skin again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought TNS Essential Serum at my doctor&#x27;s office for full price and this one is exactly the same.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item twice. once from a dermatology office and the second from amazon. My face looks great (well the skin does). I have had so many problems with the pump on both of them. They clog up and just dispense one of the products instead of both. Usually it seems to be the light brown. I&#x27;m not sure if the cost is worth it.</li>
    <li> I also do not think the product I buy through Amazon is the real thing.  The pump, 2 different times, only worked on the&lt;br /&gt;cream side.  The red never came out.&lt;br /&gt;The price is right.  The skin care place I have my facials at said not only the pump is a problem but many times it has been rejected&lt;br /&gt;by spa&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to pay the price and get the right Serum</li>
    <li> works great, I was worried that perhaps it was an expired batch and that&#x27;s why it was cheaper.  I will certainly shop through Amazon again when i am ready for a refill</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and have, for the first time in my life, been receiving unsolicited compliments on my skin.  I don&#x27;t like to waste money and this product is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but it is hit or miss when I order it from Amazon. Some vendors give me a fresher product than others. I can tell by whether the cream product is either pure white or discolored somewhat. There is a substantial difference in price if I order it directly from SkinMedica. This product was fresh which was ordered from oxom.</li>
    <li> dermatologist recommended.  I use it twice daily for aging skin.</li>
    <li> TNS is the bomb. I am 61 and I have 5 grandchildren. People always think I am in my 40&#x27;s. That&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
