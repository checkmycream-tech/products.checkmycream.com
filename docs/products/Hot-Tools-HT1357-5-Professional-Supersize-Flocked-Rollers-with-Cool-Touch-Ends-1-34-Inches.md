### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very impressed!</li>
      <li>I find preheating the rollers for 8-10 minutes give me the best results.</li>
      <li>Works great!  </li>
      <li>It is very good though.</li>
      <li>The good: they work great.  </li>
      <li>That said, the rollers do give a nice curl to the hair which holds all day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with these.  </li>
      <li>This is a very cheaply made hairsetter set.</li>
      <li>Instead, I used better clips that I purchased from Conair.  </li>
      <li>It will do until I can find a better made set.</li>
      <li>It could be better somehow.</li>
      <li>The felt rollers don&#x27;t seem to keep my hair curled, and my hair keeps a curl with curling irons and rollers pretty good.  </li>
      <li>Great product, not for me thou, I was looking for a traveling hot roller kit, it was perfect size and right amount of rolls however very fragile to withstand the check baggage handlers.</li>
      <li>I agree that the curlers warm up quickly</li>
      <li>The top of the container doesn&#x27;t fit securely and the curlers fall off the spindle holder very easily.  </li>
      <li>They are easy to break and I will recommend not to buy it.</li>
      <li>All rollers fall out easily.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of hair and a set with more rollers would REALLY come in handy.   </li>
      <li>These work out just fine for me.  </li>
      <li>They were very hot to handle and yet never got more than lukewarm on the curler itself, where your hair wraps around.</li>
      <li>Looking at the pictures, it looks good and promising with super size roller and the compactness.   </li>
      <li>I found them very easy to handle when hot.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this travel setter because the Conair setter (which works amazingly well) takes up too much room when packing.</li>
      <li>The rollers don&#x27;t sit securely on the heating element.</li>
      <li>wish that info had been available in the advertisement on Amazon.</li>
      <li>On the plus side, they are great for travel because of the overall size and dual voltage.</li>
      <li>First of all the top doesn&#x27;t fit securely.</li>
      <li>I thought these hot rollers would be great with the soft flocking.  </li>
      <li>It states it is cool touch.  </li>
      <li>There is nothing cool to the touch with these rollers.  </li>
      <li>Curl\\&quot;, with slightly smaller rollers--and a loopy curl--but superior product design.  </li>
      <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a cool place to grip</li>
      <li>very disappointing.(why am I required to write so many words?)...</li>
      <li>Well, they are HOT rollers after all, and they do take some getting used to, but like me, you&#x27;ll be fine with them after awhile.  </li>
      <li>The heating plate is exposed and the curlers are *very* hot.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to get some jumbo hot rollers.  </li>
      <li>travel or storage, find a large rubber band to secure the lid.</li>
      <li>Cool Touch Ends do not exist on thses Rollers, WAY TOO HOT to handle while rolling hair and Roller Clips do not hold hair and stay in place</li>
      <li>I like them MUCH better than the old metal clips.  </li>
      <li>Love the soft curls they produce, but they get really hot.  </li>
      <li>I begin to have doubt when i opened the packaging, the cover doesnt fit properly, and the rollers  were not sit on its place securely.</li>
      <li>They do get quite hot, so be prepared.</li>
      <li>Too hot to work with, and my hair didn&#x27;t hold the curl, which it always does</li>
      <li>They are too hot to handle and the clips do not keep them in place.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m talking seriously hot.  </li>
      <li>These curlers are so hot</li>
      <li>Too hot too handle and clips do not stay</li>
      <li>Nize size, but the plastic on the plastic get hot and burn your fingers when you roll your hair.</li>
      <li>The curlers get so hot that I got a couple of blisters on the first time use.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Too hot too handle and clips do not stay on.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find that these hot rollers added any curls to my hair.</li>
      <li>They were to hot to handle and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick to my Conair hot curlers that I use daily because they are much more manageable.</li>
      <li>Unless I use mittens (and lose dexterity), these are just too hot.  </li>
      <li>but they were so hot to the touch</li>
      <li>They take 15 minutes to heat up and the &amp;#34;cool edge&amp;#34; rollers are almost too hot to handle.  </li>
      <li>However, the curlers get way too hot to handle.</li>
      <li>the rollers are to hot on the plastic edges and burn your fingers while rolling the hair.  </li>
      <li>To my surprise,it didnt get hot.</li>
      <li>They were also so hot that I had to use a towel around my neck because every time they touched my neck, I about jumped out of my skin.  </li>
      <li>I have wasted good</li>
      <li>Love the size and they were the only ones I could find that large.  </li>
      <li>I was excited about this one, but it&#x27;s not instant hot, nor did they get very hot.  </li>
      <li>and so you must keep the lid on and be sure they are straight to heat properly.</li>
      <li>I bought this set of hot rollers because of the dual voltage and the large size of the curlers.  </li>
      <li>They are quite large, which is exactly what I need.  </li>
      <li>I guess maybe the casing could be a little more travel friendly.</li>
      <li>They are HOT and, thus, they do curl hair very well.  </li>
      <li>The size does do a nice loose curl...but dents at the roots where the clip rested!!!  </li>
      <li>openings are so large, I had to use rubber bands to keep the cover on during travel.  </li>
      <li>I prefer the large metal clips that I get from my rollers with ConAir.  </li>
      <li>I do like the large 1.75 inch roller</li>
      <li>really works, if you can put up with some inconveniences:  &lt;br</li>
      <li>The roller set is made with Cheap plastic and the lid does not stay on properly.  </li>
      <li>I use hot rollers on a daily basis, different brand, and I love them.  </li>
      <li>The Helen of Troy Hot Setter burned my fingers and only caused me much frustration.  </li>
      <li>The problem is i dont live in States,....</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t get hot enough to add curl.</li>
      <li>This set has five extra-large rollers, the largest I&#x27;ve ever found, and no useless smaller ones.</li>
      <li>Turning frizzy hair into sleek, nearly-straight waves requires really BIG hot rollers.</li>
      <li>The cool tip is too small, and the plastic edges are too hot to handle.  </li>
      <li>I purchased 3 sets of this hot roll a month ago,i like to have big, natural wave curl on my hair.  </li>
      <li>The other problem with these rollers, is the inside is a metal and get very, very hot.  </li>
      <li>When you&#x27;re trying to get ready to go out, those extra 12 minutes are virtually unbearable.  </li>
      <li>The clips are different than what most sets included in the past, but they are well designed as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
      <li>Rollers was not as hot as i expected.</li>
      <li>It gives big curls, but doesnt last  very long because it wasnt hot enough.</li>
      <li>, they are really amazing, i am still using it till now, but unfortunately the rollers are not big enough....     </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The curlers don&#x27;t fit on the base properly, therefore the lid doesn&#x27;t either. They were very hot to handle and yet never got more than lukewarm on the curler itself, where your hair wraps around. The clips were a nightmare to use and didn&#x27;t hold the rollers, they slipped out constantly.   I tried 3 times before I threw them away. Complete waste of time. I gave one star because I had to.</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 sets of this hot roll a month ago,i like to have big, natural wave curl on my hair.  Looking at the pictures, it looks good and promising with super size roller and the compactness.   I bought 3 sets because my hair is quite thick, so 5 rollers definitely is not enough.    I begin to have doubt when i opened the packaging, the cover doesnt fit properly, and the rollers  were not sit on its place securely. I have to press it down a little harder in order to sit properly.    After heating several mins, smokes came from each rollers, it was expected as it said in the instruction. Rollers was not as hot as i expected. It gives big curls, but doesnt last  very long because it wasnt hot enough. I switched it on again and leave it for another couple of mins. To my surprise,it didnt get hot. I tried couple of times since then, it didnt work at all...I dont know  what to do now, i dare not try the other set, because i am afraid it will have the same problem...  The problem is i dont live in States,....I regret buying this set. The previous rollers i bought  from Remington (Solution) , they are really amazing, i am still using it till now, but unfortunately the rollers are not big enough....     I have wasted good money,...the shipment cost almost the same with the set itself...</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get some jumbo hot rollers.  I was so disappointed in this product.  It states it is cool touch.  There is nothing cool to the touch with these rollers.  I only tried to use them once but they were so hot to the touch, I couldn&#x27;t get my hair rolled.  I won&#x27;t try again   I only bought it because it said Helen of Troy but they just sell it, not make it.  Also, when I plugged it in, it started smoking and had the smell of an electrical fire.  Not a good product at all.</li>
    <li> I was excited about this one, but it&#x27;s not instant hot, nor did they get very hot.  Back to Amazon for these.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews, which were not good, but bought it anyways.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!  Too hot to work with, and my hair didn&#x27;t hold the curl, which it always does:((  Do not purchase this!</li>
    <li> Turning frizzy hair into sleek, nearly-straight waves requires really BIG hot rollers. This set has five extra-large rollers, the largest I&#x27;ve ever found, and no useless smaller ones. (Don&#x27;t buy two sets. Buy one set and order extra rollers with the enclosed order form.)  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It really works, if you can put up with some inconveniences:  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wear gloves when handling the heated rollers. The cool tip is too small, and the plastic edges are too hot to handle.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The clamps leave a horizontal \\&quot;dent\\&quot; in the curl. Fix it with a hair dryer and styling brush after removing the rollers.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For travel or storage, find a large rubber band to secure the lid. It does not snap into place.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Heed the warning and keep out of reach of children. The heating plate is exposed and the curlers are *very* hot.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you cannot tolerate the inconveniences, consider Conair&#x27;s \\&quot;Big Curl\\&quot;, with slightly smaller rollers--and a loopy curl--but superior product design.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For the smoothest waves, get this set. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with these.  I actually bought them a few years ago, and am checking out the (new lower) price because I&#x27;m thinking of ordering another set.  I have a lot of hair and a set with more rollers would REALLY come in handy.   I read the reviews about the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; to the touch rollers.  Well, they are HOT rollers after all, and they do take some getting used to, but like me, you&#x27;ll be fine with them after awhile.  You learn not to grab too tightly...  (I tried using gloves but it found it too clumsy.)  The clips are different than what most sets included in the past, but they are well designed as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  I like them MUCH better than the old metal clips.  With these clips, you must place them above the roller, not beneath, no matter what direction you&#x27;re curling your hair, if that makes sense. I roll my hair UNDER, but grab onto the roller from above it.  I slide the clip downward into my scalp ABOVE the roller then grab it.  Works great!  You&#x27;ll get the hang of it after a few tries.  Not rocket science, people!</li>
    <li> These curlers are so hot I can&#x27;t hold them long enough to get them in my hair. Also,the lid does not close securely which is irritating. I finally put them in the trash. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Great product, not for me thou, I was looking for a traveling hot roller kit, it was perfect size and right amount of rolls however very fragile to withstand the check baggage handlers.</li>
    <li> I purchased this travel setter because the Conair setter (which works amazingly well) takes up too much room when packing. The Helen of Troy set was a huge disappointment. First of all the top doesn&#x27;t fit securely. Next, the clips don&#x27;t hold tightly so you end up with those little crease lines in your hair (not attractive). Third, the rollers are extremely hard to handle when heated--the edges are extremely hot (never had that issue with the Conair set). I was so frustrated when trying to use this product on a recent vacation that I literally left it in the hotel room rather than bother carrying it home.</li>
    <li> While these are the biggest rollers I could find, I&#x27;m not thrilled with them. The rollers don&#x27;t sit securely on the heating element. If the side of the roller touches the heating element, it melts. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a cool place to grip so either you are holding the flocking or you are burning your fingers on the plastic part of the roller. That said, the rollers do give a nice curl to the hair which holds all day.</li>
    <li> These rollers replace the Revlon Radiance travel rollers.  Pro: it packs flatter than the Revlon Radiance did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: takes dam near forever to heat up (15 minutes &amp; not a second less).  When you&#x27;re trying to get ready to go out, those extra 12 minutes are virtually unbearable.  The reason it takes longer is that the heating elements just touch the bottoms of the rollers, unlike the Revlon Radiance who&#x27;s heating elements went up through the center of the rollers.  The stumpy heating elements are the cause of another problem, &amp; that&#x27;s keeping the rollers in place on the heater.  They tend to be a bit wobbly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it does what it needs to do.</li>
    <li> I just purchased these because of the size of curlers and convenient travel size. However, the curlers get way too hot to handle. It&#x27;s really hard to roll up your hair without getting burned. Don&#x27;t like them at all.</li>
    <li> It was a little different than what I expected. It could be better somehow. It is very good though. I guess maybe the casing could be a little more travel friendly.</li>
    <li> This set of large rollers does the job, but it is annoying to use. The individual rollers sit on a very shallow heat rod and so you must keep the lid on and be sure they are straight to heat properly. They do get quite hot, so be prepared. The manufacturer suggests you let them heat for 15 minutes before using and leave them in for 15 minutes. On the plus side, they are great for travel because of the overall size and dual voltage.</li>
    <li> Love the soft curls they produce, but they get really hot.  I wear gloves to set curlers.</li>
    <li> The felt rollers don&#x27;t seem to keep my hair curled, and my hair keeps a curl with curling irons and rollers pretty good.  Had to send back and get the plastic rollers that keep my hair curled all day.</li>
    <li> This is a very cheaply made hairsetter set. It takes 15 minutes to heat up and that is per the instructions....wish that info had been available in the advertisement on Amazon. The curlers fall out of the base with the slightest wiggle; they are no on a post but just a little nub of metal which explains why they take forever to heat up. It will do until I can find a better made set. I do like the large 1.75 inch roller and they are hard to find. The seller was super but if you can find another jumbo curler set I&#x27;d go for it and not this piece of crap. Helen of Troy should be ashamed.</li>
    <li> These work out just fine for me.  They are quite large, which is exactly what I need.  I found them very easy to handle when hot.  Very impressed!</li>
    <li> The Helen of Troy Hot Setter burned my fingers and only caused me much frustration.  The top of the container doesn&#x27;t fit securely and the curlers fall off the spindle holder very easily.  The clips don&#x27;t have a place to be stored so where&#x27;s the travel convenience in that?  I would have to create a container just for these curlers and clips while traveling or search for them all rumpled around in my suitcase.  I only used it once and returned it.</li>
    <li> Nize size, but the plastic on the plastic get hot and burn your fingers when you roll your hair.</li>
    <li> All rollers fall out easily. NOT worth the money at all.  very disappointing.(why am I required to write so many words?)...</li>
    <li> The roller set is made with Cheap plastic and the lid does not stay on properly.  Seems like it is overpriced for the quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this set of hot rollers because of the dual voltage and the large size of the curlers.  I used them several times at home before a trip to Europe.  Since then I have given them away to the local thrift shop.  They did not stay on the base at all.  They are too hot to handle and the clips do not keep them in place.  I would not recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> The five curlers did not \\&quot;seat\\&quot; on the heat posts firmly and the cover did not latch down.  So unless banded with an elastic band or something, the cover would come off and all the curlers would topple out.  I returned it without using it when I saw how inconvenient it would be for travel.  If you&#x27;re not using it for travel, it might be satisfactorty.</li>
    <li> They are totally useless. They do not do the job. They are easy to break and I will recommend not to buy it.</li>
    <li> Cool Touch Ends do not exist on thses Rollers, WAY TOO HOT to handle while rolling hair and Roller Clips do not hold hair and stay in place, hair just falls out, therefore curls are uneven or you have to constantly re-roll your hair.  I am returning the product.</li>
    <li> These are awful...the heating element is weird and the rollers fall off easily...the rollers are to hot on the plastic edges and burn your fingers while rolling the hair.  The clips leave dents in your hair.  I burned the palm of my hand on the heating element trying to move it on the sink.  The size does do a nice loose curl...but dents at the roots where the clip rested!!!  Really not worth a dime.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t possibly touch the ends. That is impossible when you are trying to roll your hair with it. You will get burned every time.</li>
    <li> Should have listened to reviews! Too hot to handle and hate the clips (won&#x27;t hold or leave a crease in your hair).  Love the size and they were the only ones I could find that large.  Hate to use them.</li>
    <li> Be careful if you buy these rollers.  They take 15 minutes to heat up and the &amp;#34;cool edge&amp;#34; rollers are almost too hot to handle.  One other thing I learned with this order is that beauty or personal products cannot be retuned.</li>
    <li> I ordered these rollers for a cruise. I thought they would take up less room in suitcase, which they did , but  to use them was impossible. They were to hot to handle and clips did not hold.</li>
    <li> I thought these hot rollers would be great with the soft flocking.  They do not hold onto your hair and he clips do not hold onto the rollers.  Would have sent them back but needed them as soon as they arrived.  Not worth the  money.  The other problem with these rollers, is the inside is a metal and get very, very hot.  You have to be careful when handling them.</li>
    <li> The good: they work great.  They are HOT and, thus, they do curl hair very well.  I didn&#x27;t use the clips that came with them.  Instead, I used better clips that I purchased from Conair.  The bad:  they really are so hot that I had a very difficult time handling them.  I&#x27;m talking seriously hot.  I bought these for a recent trip and I had a very hard time trying to grab a curler and wrap my hair around it as fast as I could.  They were also so hot that I had to use a towel around my neck because every time they touched my neck, I about jumped out of my skin.  Unless I use mittens (and lose dexterity), these are just too hot.  I&#x27;ll stick to my Conair hot curlers that I use daily because they are much more manageable.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find that these hot rollers added any curls to my hair. They don&#x27;t get hot enough to add curl.</li>
    <li> I like the jumbo size.  I like the compact case for traveling.  I don&#x27;t care for the clips that come with it.  I prefer the large metal clips that I get from my rollers with ConAir.  I find preheating the rollers for 8-10 minutes give me the best results.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before making my purchase and seeing a couple of negative reviews didn&#x27;t sway me, someone can always find something negative.  I agree that the curlers warm up quickly but that&#x27;s all I can say.  First of all, there&#x27;s no way I could use the clips that came with rollers, they don&#x27;t work and won&#x27;t stay on if you have thick hair. The curlers get so hot that I got a couple of blisters on the first time use.  Then after allowing to stay in my hair for over 30 minutes, there were no curls.  I use hot rollers on a daily basis, different brand, and I love them.  Lastly, not sure what the cover is for, it won&#x27;t stay on and the vent? openings are so large, I had to use rubber bands to keep the cover on during travel.  I have no plans on using again and it will be recycled.</li>
    <li> it is not working! I am  so upset.</li>
    <li> Too hot too handle and clips do not stay on.&lt;br /&gt;Too hot too handle and clips do not stay on.</li>
