<li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still giving this item 4 stars because it arrived as described, faster than promised, and is the quality I expected for the price.</li>
<li> For the price, the quality is as expected.</li>
<li> I ordered the wrong color apparently but it arrived 3 weeks early!</li>
<li> maybe she just has a big head because it didnt look overly small.</li>
<li> Tried to stretch the bands separate from each other</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried to wear it a few times and always ended up taking it off before even leaving home for a one reason only: the rhinestones stop at the crown of my head, leaving so much plain metal exposed</li>
<li> Took a while to show up and one of the rhinestones is upside down.</li>
<li> Unbelievable, I know, the crystals are very clear and the ends are a little uncomfortable and sharp, like pointy sharp.</li>
<li> my daughter said it squeezes her head too tight though.</li>
<li> Too tight.</li>
<li> Problem is it does not fit like that.  </li>
<li> I just can&#x27;t get past it.</li>
<li> It looks like it would fit a small child, and when you put it on it the metal hurts really bad behind your ears!</li>
<li> so you can see what I mean and decide for yourself if you can handle that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Also, I&#x27;m not pleased with this at all!</li>
<li> Headband ends poorly constructed, keep snagging my hair.</li>
<li> Awkward angle, doesn&#x27;t set on head correctly.</li>
<li> Disappointed</li>
<li> Horrible shipping!</li>
<li> I had horrible migraine after wearing it for an evening.</li>

    <li> Very pretty. Doesn&#x27;t look cheap. Very comfortable</li>
    <li> Horrible shipping! It took 1 1/2 months to get here! Also, I&#x27;m not pleased with this at all! It looks like it would fit a small child, and when you put it on it the metal hurts really bad behind your ears! I would advise spending a little more money to get something a lot nicer!</li>

    <li> I bought it for myself, 66 and loving it....  puts a sparkle in my day and step</li>
    <li> This beautiful double strand of rhinestones is fantastic to wear for special occasions.  I bought it when I was going on a cruise and it was perfect to dress up my hair before dinner.</li>
    <li> Bought it for to have a simple look of two headbands in one.  Problem is it does not fit like that.  Tried to stretch the bands separate from each other but it&#x27;s going to break if I apply more pressure than I have.  Disappointed</li>
    <li> Not bad. Took a while to show up and one of the rhinestones is upside down. But okay for the price.</li>
    <li> Flimsy and doesn&#x27;t fit right. Too tight. Guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Wow, this is beautiful and elegant.  I purchased this item for a gift. It&#x27;s just pretty.</li>
    <li> Awkward angle, doesn&#x27;t set on head correctly.</li>
    <li> This handband is so cute. Came super fast also</li>
    <li> This is a cute headband. I like it but gave it 4 stars b/c it starts to hurt the sides of my head after a while. But that may just be because I have a big head. I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>

    <li> This is a cheap headband, and it shows. I&#x27;ve tried to wear it a few times and always ended up taking it off before even leaving home for a one reason only: the rhinestones stop at the crown of my head, leaving so much plain metal exposed that to me it looks tacky. I just can&#x27;t get past it. I&#x27;m including a photo so you can see what I mean and decide for yourself if you can handle that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still giving this item 4 stars because it arrived as described, faster than promised, and is the quality I expected for the price. In addition, it doesn&#x27;t pinch my head, something almost all headbands do. Comfort ranks very highly in my book. If I wasn&#x27;t such a perfectionist and could get past the plain metal look, I&#x27;d love this headband.</li>
    <li> The product is so amazing. I could nt love it anymore</li>
