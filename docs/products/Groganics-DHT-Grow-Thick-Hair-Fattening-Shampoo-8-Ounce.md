      <li>I can see that I am not losing any more hair (right now).  </li>
      <li>This is a really great product to use if you have dry itchy scalp.</li>
      <li>From the first day I used it I&#x27;ve seen fantastic results.</li>
      <li>Nioxin has been great for a few years.  </li>
      <li>; it was just thin &amp; I experienced a lot of shedding, so I cut it to my shoulders to even it out &amp; have healthy ends, etc...  </li>

      <li>I see some young hair sprouting out over some parts of my head, however, I will still have to see if it grows back in the part where I lost hair the most.</li>

      <li>Feel as though my hair was the same, or better, from a regular  2 dollar shampoo</li>
      <li>My hair is STRONGER, thicker, fuller, &amp; I have a lot of new growth ( I haven&#x27;t measured yet, I&#x27;m going to wait about 2 months).  </li>

      <li>The \\&quot;freeze\\&quot; shampoos &amp; conditioner also works wonders &amp; leaves your hair SOFT!  </li>
      <li>The ingredients weren&#x27;t listed on the description but from the name of the shampoo I assumed it was natural, I WAS WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> It lathers very well so a little goes a long way!  </li>
<li> His hair is much thicker, healthier, and there is very little if any noticeable dandruff.</li>
<li> second ingredient is Ammonium lauryl sulfate, this is not natural and is a SKIN IRRITANT.</li>
<li> There is no way to prove it has had any positive or negative effect on my scalp.  </li>
<li> My hair definitely does not shed like it was; regular shedding &amp; not much at all!  </li>
<li> u can also still feel it tingling ur scalp long after washing!  </li>
<li> The only downside is that as far as I can tell, none of the products softens and that is a problem if you have even slightly hard water or dry hair and skin.</li>
<li> For nine dollars and (8) eight ounces, I thought it wasn&#x27;t too bad even if it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
<li> He now swears by this stuff and keeps recommending it to other people.</li>
<li> This shampoo lathers up well only need to you small amount.</li>
<li> Change the filter on your shower head every (6) six months minimum to eliminate chlorines and other chemical s that DO cause hair to fall</li>
<li> The experince was so bad I couldnt recall the precise name of the shampoo for the conditioner review</li>
<li> NOT WORTH COMMENTING ON</li>
<li> The only complaint I have to make about them is that both the conditioner and the shampoo bottles are really small, so if you have really long hair, you might want to buy two of each</li>
<li> although not drastic, hair became thicker than previous.</li>
<li> He has a slightly receding hair line and dandruff problems.</li>
<li> Hopefully it will make my hair grow thick and long.</li>
<li> There is no tingling, no special feeling, but if it can get rid of that DHT, I&#x27;ll be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
<li> so I Just named it \\&quot;its horrid little partner\\</li>
<li> for a few years now every night (once a day).  </li>
<li> I have been buying this for my boyfriend for a few months now (about 6 or 7).</li>
<li> The combination of the three seems to be working, or at least plateauing.  </li>
<li> thick hair...and</li>
<li> This is the only one I found that wasn&#x27;t crazy expensive.  </li>
<li> &quot; So maybe having your worse hair loss experience isn&#x27;t how it goes for everyone</li>
<li> I THOUGHT I had a winner until the third time I used it than I thought I had slipped into my worst nightmare.</li>
<li> Who hnows the expensive stuff probably doesn&#x27;t work either.</li>
<li> So beware this may not be the solution to your problem, it appears from my experience that if you don&#x27;t lay out hundreds of dollars for a years supply of \\&quot;hair miracle\\&quot; you aren&#x27;t going to get any results in fact the cheaper products could make things worse!!!</li>

    <li> Works MIRACLES!!!!! You will notice results immediately! Do use it with the conditioner though. The only downside is that as far as I can tell, none of the products softens and that is a problem if you have even slightly hard water or dry hair and skin.</li>
    <li> This shampoo did more damage than good but it tricked me the first two times, i actually thought I had a winner. I THOUGHT I had a winner until the third time I used it than I thought I had slipped into my worst nightmare. The experince was so bad I couldnt recall the precise name of the shampoo for the conditioner review so I Just named it \\&quot;its horrid little partner\\&quot; So maybe having your worse hair loss experience isn&#x27;t how it goes for everyone but I highly doubt I am the only person this has happened too. So beware this may not be the solution to your problem, it appears from my experience that if you don&#x27;t lay out hundreds of dollars for a years supply of \\&quot;hair miracle\\&quot; you aren&#x27;t going to get any results in fact the cheaper products could make things worse!!! Who hnows the expensive stuff probably doesn&#x27;t work either. Those I can&#x27;t comment on I have car payments to make instead!!!</li>
    <li> I have been buying this for my boyfriend for a few months now (about 6 or 7). He has a slightly receding hair line and dandruff problems. After trying everything with no results he had given in to defeat. But after convincing him to use this he has seen massive results. His hair is much thicker, healthier, and there is very little if any noticeable dandruff. He now swears by this stuff and keeps recommending it to other people.</li>
    <li> The ingredients weren&#x27;t listed on the description but from the name of the shampoo I assumed it was natural, I WAS WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second ingredient is Ammonium lauryl sulfate, this is not natural and is a SKIN IRRITANT. I get scalp irritation if I use sulfates. Below are findings from the American College of Toxicology:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In its final report on the safety of sodium lauryl sulfate, the Journal of the American College of Toxicology notes that this ingredient has a \\&quot;degenerative effect on the cell membranes because of its protein denaturing properties.\\&quot; What&#x27;s more, the journal adds, \\&quot;high levels of skin penetration may occur at even low use concentration.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have been using the entire Groganics hair system for about 3 weeks &amp; I&#x27;m amazed!  My hair definitely does not shed like it was; regular shedding &amp; not much at all!  My hair is STRONGER, thicker, fuller, &amp; I have a lot of new growth ( I haven&#x27;t measured yet, I&#x27;m going to wait about 2 months).  The \\&quot;freeze\\&quot; shampoos &amp; conditioner also works wonders &amp; leaves your hair SOFT!  Using the Groganics system on a daily basis produces the best results!  I wash &amp; deep condition my hair twice a week as some of the daily hair products are a bit oily, however they do show RESULTS!  I also use the vitamins, but I only take one a day as my hair does grow rapidly; it was just thin &amp; I experienced a lot of shedding, so I cut it to my shoulders to even it out &amp; have healthy ends, etc...  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Groganics!</li>
    <li> This works as a thickner for your hair. Iv&#x27;e been using this for a month along with the featherlite conditioner and my hair hasn&#x27;t grown any but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a fine as it was.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s helping with hair loss.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft while using. Good suds. No noticeable change in the quality of my hair from using it. Feel as though my hair was the same, or better, from a regular  2 dollar shampoo</li>
    <li> I used it for two months until today. Hair obviously does not regrow instantly. However, Hair fall Stopped. I see some young hair sprouting out over some parts of my head, however, I will still have to see if it grows back in the part where I lost hair the most. As of today, it works satisfactorily. It has saw palmetto which really works well for hair growth&amp;lt;from various sources over internet&gt;. Right after 3-4 usages, I noticed that hair fall reduced. I did not see any reaction over my head or hair. So, at least for me, it was totally safe to use. I also noticed thickening of hair- although not drastic, hair became thicker than previous.</li>
    <li> NOT WORTH COMMENTING ON</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  Almost five months and no change either way.  I think I&#x27;ve reached my zenith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  It has been over two months now.  My hair is receding more around the crown than it did before I used this shampoo.  There is no way to prove it has had any positive or negative effect on my scalp.  I am giving it back to 3-stars, as everyone&#x27;s chemistry is different.  I can only say that it was at most, a neutral product for hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shopped around a lot for a DHT blocker shampoo that had no chemicals - all natural.  This is the only one I found that wasn&#x27;t crazy expensive.  For nine dollars and (8) eight ounces, I thought it wasn&#x27;t too bad even if it didn&#x27;t work.  But (8) eight ounces goes a long way, as I only need about a dime&#x27;s worth to make it lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about a month and I only let it sit for about two minutes.  After completely rinsing, I add [[ASIN:B000XTCFME Nioxin Scalp Therapy, System 2 (Noticeably Thinning ) Conditioner, 33.8 Ounce]] for conditioning and hair thickening.  Nioxin has been great for a few years.  I&#x27;ve reviewed that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used [[ASIN:B000ZOHOQO Minoxidil for Men 5% Minoxidil Hair Regrowth Treatment 12 Months Supply Unscented 1 Year]] for a few years now every night (once a day).  The combination of the three seems to be working, or at least plateauing.  My review of Minoxidil is extensive with updates.  I plan on updating this review every month.  I can see that I am not losing any more hair (right now).  There is no tingling, no special feeling, but if it can get rid of that DHT, I&#x27;ll be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that DHT is not always the reason hair falls out!  Change the filter on your shower head every (6) six months minimum to eliminate chlorines and other chemical s that DO cause hair to fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another update in one month.</li>
    <li> Already see results on hair growth on bald spot within a month of use. This is a miracle product, why is stuff like this not advertised on TV?</li>
    <li> This is a really great product to use if you have dry itchy scalp. It soothes you scalp and minimizes the dryness. If you use shampoo, conditioner and hairdress you will love you hair.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much difference.</li>
    <li> good product...good for the hair...just what I wanted....thick hair...and also full...love it.. the cream is excellent product. works for me...</li>
    <li> my hair feels real great and have more body holding very well. I am very glad that I try the product.</li>
    <li> I love this product! From the first day I used it I&#x27;ve seen fantastic results. I have really thin hair and in conjunction with the other groganic products I&#x27;m using; I&#x27;m seeing great results. I use the shampoo and the feather light volumizing conditioner, which seems to really complement each other nicely. The only complaint I have to make about them is that both the conditioner and the shampoo bottles are really small, so if you have really long hair, you might want to buy two of each or else you will run out of it in a week.</li>
    <li> its very good try it you will see the defendant</li>
    <li> This shampoo is very smooth and makes my scalp feel really refreshed, so far I like it a lot. Hopefully it will make my hair grow thick and long.</li>
    <li> This shampoo lathers up well only need to you small amount. Excellent smell. It makes your hair so soft and silky</li>
    <li> Like a shampoo and conditioner in one!</li>
    <li> I finally found the perfect shampoo for me!  I&#x27;ve used it twice and already see results!  It lathers very well so a little goes a long way!  Makes my hair feel soft and can already see it thickening!  Oh yeah u can also still feel it tingling ur scalp long after washing!  Will be purchasing more asap</li>
