<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I keep this on hand. When I first began to use it 20 years ago, under a smaller company name,  it seemed to heal skin conditions or cold sores much faster. Probably diluted it, as large companies usually do. I still keep it on hand though....aloe is great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true.  I have dry places on my skin from sun exposure and my doctor said to put an aloe based ointment or cream on them.  Tri Derma alleviates the dryness and stops the itching.  it is an excellent moisturizer.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products that I use frequently on my dry skin.  Tells me I need 7 more words so here they are.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for the last 2 months. No visible difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;Panday&lt;br /&gt;Brisbane</li>
    <li> I love this cream. Doesn&#x27;t matter if I have a rash, a burn, a hard healing pimple this is the cream for me. Sadly I could not find it in the store again, so I orders over amazon. I know every skin is different, but for me that&#x27;s the product and for that price, you can not go wrong.</li>
    <li> This cream is very thick and when I put it on, it gets hard and wax-like and clumps on my skin.  Didn&#x27;t notice it help heal my sores any faster than they were without it.  Didn&#x27;t care for this cream.</li>
    <li> October 29th 2013 review update.&lt;br /&gt;I still recommend this product for skin issues but my problems have for the most part gone away.&lt;br /&gt;I started using Clear Hair Shampoo for Men.&lt;br /&gt;I also switched barbers...turns out he wasn&#x27;t disinfecting his clippers like he should have.&lt;br /&gt;My scalp issues were in fact barber rash.&lt;br /&gt;I no longer use this particular product but I still recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people know I have scalp issues.&lt;br /&gt;My barber told me I have ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s ingrown hairs, scalp acne etc... as I have never been to a dermatologist and been officially diagnosed.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an embarrassing condition but one I could live with. Well, sort of.&lt;br /&gt;You see, I like my hair short. As in Marine short.&lt;br /&gt;The back and sides shaved.&lt;br /&gt;I sort of gave up on that look as my scalp was too atrocious to look at.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything...&lt;br /&gt;Oil or Oregano&lt;br /&gt;Tea Tree Oil&lt;br /&gt;Bump Stopper&lt;br /&gt;Emu Oil&lt;br /&gt;Neosporin&lt;br /&gt;Organic Shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;I even switched out my shower head with a shower filter.&lt;br /&gt;Some of these things worked, but after a while the bumps would return with a vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;Itchy, painful.&lt;br /&gt;Then after giving in and getting another military hair cut I started Googling out of sheer disgust.&lt;br /&gt;I found that zinc is used as an acne treatment (One of the ingredients in this version of Triderma).&lt;br /&gt;After much searching I finally found a link to Triderma.&lt;br /&gt;The reviews all over the web are stellar, so I marched down to Walgreen&#x27;s and bought a tube.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fairly pricey but I was desperate...again.&lt;br /&gt;I applied just a tiny amount to my raw scalp at 1:30PM today, it is now 7:00 PM.&lt;br /&gt;A measly five and a half hours later and.....my scalp hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years.&lt;br /&gt;Almost all the bumps are already gone or are shrinking rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing, nothing short of amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care how expensive this stuff is, I&#x27;ll keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;Will the bumps eventually return???&lt;br /&gt;Only time will tell and I&#x27;ll make sure and post a future update.&lt;br /&gt;Yayyyy...I can finally look like a tough guy again.&lt;br /&gt;So cool.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Tridermal, you have given me my scalp back.&lt;br /&gt;Itching....gone.&lt;br /&gt;Pain...gone.&lt;br /&gt;Redness...gone.&lt;br /&gt;Inflamation...gone.&lt;br /&gt;A few bumps here and there, hopefully they&#x27;ll be gone within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Effective, non greasy, no fragrance, highest recommendations.&lt;br /&gt;Only time will tell and I&#x27;ll make sure and post a future update.&lt;br /&gt;Yayyyy...I can finally look like a tough guy again.&lt;br /&gt;So cool.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Tridermal, you have given me my scalp back.&lt;br /&gt;Itching....gone.&lt;br /&gt;Pain...gone.&lt;br /&gt;Redness...gone.&lt;br /&gt;Inflamation...gone.&lt;br /&gt;A few bumps here and there, hopefully they&#x27;ll be gone within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Effective, non greasy, no fragrance, highest recommendations.</li>
    <li> Did not deliver as advertised</li>
    <li> Used it for my face, have psorioasis.  It immediately burned.  I tried it several times.  Still get that burning feeling then it goes away.  I haven&#x27;t tried it for anything else.  Can&#x27;t say that it helped because I didn&#x27;t stick with it.  I have to say the burning did get less when I did it for several days, but I still experienced that intial burning.</li>
    <li> The name of this cream speaks for itself, \\&quot;Intense Fast Healing Cream.\\&quot; This Triderma cream works way better than any other over the counter skin creams. I use it as my everyday facial moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and greasy, works well with MAC Studio fix!</li>
    <li> I am a senior citizen, and have found this product to be very good at treating skin keratoses and other skin irritations. You need to treat daily for best results. We used it to treat the bed sores suffered by my mother-in-law; this ointment worked better than her prescription drugs.</li>
    <li> This cleared up my mother&#x27;s pressure sores (not infected) in about a week. I would highly recommend this product. Am very happy.</li>
    <li> I have recommended this to others after using many other products that didn&#x27;t work as well, I have reordered twice</li>
    <li> This is effective for healing pressure sores and helps hands, no matter how badly you have neglected them. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I had awful skin problems on my face including eczema, dry peeling skin which would tear and scab, and breakouts. I had tried many, many expensive products including other healing creams in an effort to remedy this problem with no success. While my results were not as fast as some others have described with this product, about 3 weeks after using this my skin looked soooo much better. I even stopped breaking out and got that \\&quot;healthy glow\\&quot; back. If I stop using this product my problems come back almost immediately so I use it every day as a moisturizer. My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, it&#x27;s not perfumed so it doesn&#x27;t smell great but the smell does not bother me either. To me it has no smell. I just pray they never discontinue this because it&#x27;s lifesaver!</li>
    <li> It get my skin worse than before,  After application, my skin become red, hives, and burn.  I have to take benadryl and apply hydrocortisone cream.  I wish I never buy this product</li>
    <li> Thank you very nice product.</li>
    <li> GREAT ITEM WORKS GREAT ON SKIN</li>
    <li> Excellent product would recommend.</li>
    <li> was recommended from a friend and i would recommend it as well. Thanks for the great product and price! yeah</li>
    <li> Surprisingly effective.  I happened to take a fall against a block wall the day that the cream arrived in the mail.  My arm was scraped from elbow to wrist with some areas being fairly deeply abraded.  Instead of the normal first aid cream I decided to try the TriDerma.  It&#x27;s two weeks later and I&#x27;m completely healed... with very little scarring.  The TriDerma definitely helped me heal much quicker than normal and was very soothing when applied.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would help with a dry/itchy skin condition that recently popped up on my husband&#x27;s shins (he keeps scratching them non-stop to the point of drawing blood!). While this was a great moisturizer, it didn&#x27;t help with his problem. If your only concern is really just dry skin and not a possible skin condition, this should definitely help! It absorbed quickly enough and wasn&#x27;t very greasy, and the container has lasted him a few months.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.. No dramatic healing and burned sometimes.</li>
    <li> This product with genuine virgin aloe, healed a cold sore in two days, when may other products I tried didn&#x27;t work for 2 months! May sting if used on open sores, but absolutely awesome for skin conditions! A main stay in my life!</li>
    <li> Did not work, not event moisturize enough!! So I have one brand new jar and a 3/4 second jar left just hang around in my cabinet for nothing!!! Waste of money !!!</li>
    <li> The best healing creme I have ever found.  I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.  Put it on anything, and it will heal faster than any other remedy.  And it avoids cortisone/steroids, which is healthier.</li>
    <li> VERY, VERY GOOD for dry skin also a good product.</li>
    <li> This cream works GREAT, and we couldn&#x27;t find it locally.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why some moisturizing creams work better than others, but my wife has dry feet that crack and hurt.&lt;br /&gt;We have tried prescription, and many over the counter products.&lt;br /&gt;Only this one brings her relief, and seems to aid healing.&lt;br /&gt;We will know more as weeks progress.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!!!  It&#x27;s my 3rd bottle and it does heal things nothing else will!!!</li>
    <li> We use it most of the time with very good results. We recommend it to anyone who needs to heal the small skin damage.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this product for about a year.  It has helped to heal irritations and sores on his amputated leg.  Leaves the skin great shape and works fast.  Glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> aids in healing where other creams didn&#x27;t help. Really helped with some Psoriasis problems that were beginning on my elbows. Now they look great.</li>
    <li> Had a severe allergic reaction to something. After a lot  of scratching my skin was pretty broken and irritated. This lotion did wonders!</li>
    <li> Cream seems to work as described, it&#x27;s a little slow to heal but provides a complete heal.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a reduction in the scar on my knee</li>
    <li> TriDerma is fast healing.</li>
    <li> This stuff works I&#x27;ve tried allot of different things on the tinea versicolor on my skin and this is working and working quickly and I got it quicker then they said i would. I&#x27;m pretty happy</li>
    <li> I love how creamy this cream is.  It glides on irritated and sensitive skin nicely and seems to help a lot.</li>
    <li> My son said does help his pressure sores heal faster !!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has really bad eczema. After reading the wonderful reviews I decided to purchase it. Well, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize her skin for very long. We&#x27;ll just stick to petroleum jelly and Cetephil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just keep in mind, this may work for some but not others.</li>
    <li> This product it so great.  Healed a wound that would not heal for 1 year...  in 3 days a major improvement was seem.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!! You will notice a difference in 3 days. Dry, cracked, peeling, calluses are all treated. On my fourth jar. If you wear sandals you will appreciate it. Also love the fact that there is no perfume smell. Five Stars.</li>
    <li> This cream is awesome. I had a scar from a surgery procedure on my knee and I used this daily. Everyone said it is the best looking scar they ever saw. It is faint and smooth. I highly recommend this cream. You don&#x27;t need a lot so the jar last a long time.</li>
    <li> works wonderful on bruises, specially when your a diabetic , and on blood thinners , nice item to recommend A+</li>
    <li> Derma Intense Fast Healing is also great in relieving the any skin problems that you may have.  It lubricates and softens the skin and improves the appearance of most conditions of the skin.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I used it for SEVERE bedsores on my patient and healed her very rapidly. Excellent stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple of years ago as I needed something to help heal some sores and it worked perfectly.  This past winter season I have had extremely dry, almost cracked skin (due to a recent health issue) on my hands and other parts of my body and having tried some other OTC products which didn&#x27;t work, I turned to the intense healing cream and it improved my skin&#x27;s condition the first time I tried it.  So, if you have very dry hands or other body parts, you might want to try this.</li>
    <li> Not effective on pressure sores.</li>
    <li> I needed a cream for some severely allergic reactions (from post-surgical drainage) on my skin that were making it raw.  Later I needed this for redness and blistering from chemo.  In both cases, it was soothing, emollient without being greasy, and smelled minimally, but pleasantly.  I tried many, and this has been my favorite.  It wasn&#x27;t a miracle healer, but it helped.</li>
    <li> This is a soothing cream and I would endorse it for your general first aid kit. It didn&#x27;t help my psoriasis at all, didn&#x27;t hurt it, but was hoping maybe it would calm it down. It would help for other things though, minor irritations, scrapes and whatnot. It isn&#x27;t marketed for psoriasis but I thought I&#x27;d try it anyway. Tri Derma is an excellent brand though, and this is a good product.</li>
    <li> TriDerma seems to be remarkable!  &amp;#34;Thin-skin&amp;#34; is extremely susceptible to hematomas.  After using the cream for a few days I can see a vast improvement.  I&#x27;m certainly becoming a convinced fan!</li>
    <li> I was turned onto it at a hospital and have since been hooked. I have RA and not only bruise easy but my skin is fragile ripping easily. It is a must in my house. Now my elderly Grandmother keeps it on hand.</li>
    <li> Works fine for healing and soothing rough skin.  Nice fragrance and is not oily or sticky.  Would not hesitate to buy it again.</li>
    <li> I ordered TriDerma for my mother and she used it for her burned skin and she healed very fast she just love it</li>
    <li> cleared up exema and itchy spots on elbows, knuckles and else where. Has stopped formation of summer brown spots on face and arms and back of hands. Odorless and not sticky.</li>
    <li> Tri Derma really works. In just a few days I saw the difference to cuts on my hands and around my cuticles.</li>
    <li> I have been very lucky and never really had any skin issues...until about 2 months ago.  Some horrible creepy-crud rash got my face, ears and neck.  I tried cortisone over the counter - nothing.  My skin got so sensitive that I couldn&#x27;t use my regular skin care regime (Murad) which I&#x27;d been using for years.  I went to a doctor who suggested I use plain Vaseline.  I did.  While it moisturized, it didn&#x27;t &#x27;heal&#x27;--but I was very slippery and shiny which accentuated my condition visually.  Went to another doctor, who prescribed antibotics (in case it was bacterial, I guess).  Still no significant improvement.  Desperate, I search on Amazon, and luckily found this magic cream.  No burning, no grease, no shine...and within 24 hours and two applications there was a visible improvement.  I&#x27;m on day 3 and it&#x27;s 99.5% gone.  It might be a coincidence, but I&#x27;m not going to be without this stuff...the name is totally right \\&quot;Intense, Fast-Healing&#x27;.  Definitely.    UPDATE: 4.8.2014 - My skin condition (thankfully) has not returned after this cream cleared it up.  I keep the remaining cream on-hand...just in case.</li>
    <li> I apply the cream twice a day to the area that has the painful callused skin.. The area remains soft and less painful doing that twice a day</li>
    <li> For deep healing, this cream is the best I&#x27;ve ever found.  It heals all sorts of skin issues and does it quickly.  It&#x27;s great for burns and just keeping your skin extremely hydrated.  F. Parker</li>
    <li> I did not get the product pictured. I got a tube which seems a little different from the  jar which I  had used before</li>
    <li> My mom uses this product.  It is the only thing that works on a &amp;#34;hot spot&amp;#34; that comes from sitting in a wheelchair all day.</li>
    <li> Pictured as a jar with blue writing....came in a tube with green writing.  Nonetheless...it gave me a rash and I do not have sensitive skin,  I went to CVS to get cream to clear rash.</li>
    <li> Helps when I get heat rashes!</li>
    <li> Not worth the price. I expected a whole lot more.</li>
    <li> Helped my wife get thru radiation therapy. We&#x27;ve given 10 jars to folks with similar problems, all love the product</li>
    <li> It works very well for us.&lt;br /&gt;Thought it a little pricey, but will reorder it&lt;br /&gt;again in the future and recommend it to our friends</li>
    <li> Rosacea seems to be quite individualistic to each person with this condition.  I have mild to moderate rosacea with redness &amp; those blisters.  Condition is exacerbated in cold weather.  TriDerma (jar or tube), clears up the redness if used diligently.  In cold weather I apply this on skin &amp; use a skin sensitive mosturizer over TriDerma.  The healing cream in a jar is quite rich also.  I love this product; it works for me better then any other product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Save your $</li>
    <li> I have a rash which often itches.  Using this cream keeps the itching to a minimum and helps keep the redness away.</li>
    <li> This does not heal a wound over night, but it does speed things up a lot. It&#x27;s great after a chemical peel or to heal a blemish. What surprised me too was I had a scar that was about two months old and it was still pink. I was using emu oil and some silicon and nothing was really happening. Then I used this and in two weeks all the pink was gone! I feel it also makes normal skin more healthy, but I do experience a drying effect as others have stated. Nothing a dedicated moisturizer can&#x27;t fix though.</li>
    <li> We probably all try a few products before finding one that works for us.&lt;br /&gt;I tried at least three and then heard about this one.  My hands looked like&lt;br /&gt;they had been burned, red, raised and itchy.  This product worked well for&lt;br /&gt;me and now at the first sign of itching, I begin using it a few times a day, again at night.  I will&lt;br /&gt;not be without it.  I don&#x27;t think there is one product that would be perfect for every&lt;br /&gt;skin problem, and thats understandable.</li>
    <li> I used this on a diabetic ulcer and within five minutes I had to remove it because it was burning so bad! For days after it still hurt a lot, more than normal,  too. This may work good for dry skin  but I am warning you that it is definitely not a cream to be used on ulcers,  slow healing or not. No refunds either,  so buyer beware.</li>
    <li> It did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> My husband and I care for my paralyzed dad at home. My Dad sleeps sitting up in his recliner because he has difficult breathing when lying in bed. His bottom was begging to break down and was very painful for him. I tried many different products that just proved to be a waste of time and money. I bought DERMA intense fast healing because of all the good reviews posted. I received this in the mail on august 8th and now just 3 days later I already see an amazing improvement. My dads bottom is still a little read but it is improved beyond my expectations. I would recommend this product for any one. LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
    <li> In my opinion, Derma Intense Fast Healing cream does an adequate job  for skin with minor damage.  It does not heal or actually help severley damaged skin, such as a venous leg ulcer.</li>
    <li> if your looking for a cream to work on even burnt skin, this product is better then anything you could ever buy in my eyes. try one for yourself. only 14.00. I have shared with many people only to have them all agree. 5 star rating</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see the differance.I expected more from reading other reviews. I&#x27;m not too happy with the product.Also very thick and is greasy feeling no matter how much you use.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream and found it to work well where other treatment creams have not worked.  I have reordered when the container was emptied.</li>
    <li> This cream has been an answer to prayer - it will basically aide in healing any skin area or irritation!  I am trul sold on it.  My wife likes it too!</li>
    <li> I have had a bedsore for the past month that would not stop bleeding heavily.  Two days after starting treatment with TriDerma Intense Fast Healing Cream, my bedsore completely stopped bleeding and within four days, was completely healed.  This cream is super FAST HEALING.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my chapped lips and as a hand cream.  It is so economical that I will start using it this winter as a body lotion during cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;The best product I&#x27;ve bought in ages.</li>
    <li> I have been using this healing cream for the past couple of days and I can notice the scrape on my hand seems to be healing a little faster than normally. Good communication with the company on the shipping too!</li>
    <li> Not as advertised for healing skin ulcers.</li>
    <li> My 16 year old uses it on his face for acne breakouts.  It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT CAME IN A TUBE AND NOT THIS JAR.</li>
    <li> So glad I discovered this stuff, it really is great. It is really an amazing and versatile product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for dry hands..I keep it on my kitchen sink counter and use it many times a day.</li>
    <li> A staple in my medical cabinet. It&#x27;s magic.</li>
    <li> Got this for my girlfriend&#x27;s mother. it seem to work well.</li>
    <li> I had issues with the tip of my nose peeling or worse.  It was always red, even after employing numerous lotions/creams, Neosporin, and special soaps.  I bought this off recommendations and I couldn&#x27;t be happy since my nose has finally healed, as well as any area I apply this too.  By far this is the best neutral scented cream I have ever used which was great since I was applying it directly around my nose.  Definitely will re-order when depleted.</li>
    <li> it pain my mom a lot when she put it on so I call it a lost.</li>
    <li> Best product on the market!! Ingredients are the best you can find. Use it on face mixed with a Argan oil and even got a little burn on finger and it healed immediately</li>
    <li> This cream is a miracle! I have reoccurring skin peeling on my fingers and it got so bad that I would bleed and it was very painful, it wouldn&#x27;t hardly heal. I found this cream and I use it morning and night and it has completely cleared it up! I love this product and would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> Glad it doesn&#x27;t have parabeans</li>
    <li> no comment at this time.</li>
    <li> This is our second jar iic the healing cream.  We have found it to be very helpful and to help the wounds heal abit faster than usual.</li>
    <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t seem to do much more than cocoa butter - but perhaps I didn&#x27;t notice that it was fabulous because of what I was using it for.&lt;br /&gt;However, it smelled nice and was soothing.</li>
    <li> Applies well. Still waiting on results of healing</li>
    <li> Nice cream, my son has eczema and very sensitive skin, this helps him (as long as we remember to keep using it..).  This does not aggravate him like some of the other creams do. It is not some &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; cream, but is a good product.</li>
    <li> I have steriod induced roscea and no topicals have worked for me. I read the reviews of this product and decided to try it out. It has really calmed the inflammation on my face. I&#x27;m so pleased I just placed my second order.</li>
    <li> Great product and a great price as well. Thank you for  carring this  lotion.  This is the best cream on the market for skin.</li>
    <li> thought I&#x27;d try for my dermatitis, but didn&#x27;t work for me.  I&#x27;ve used a little over a week (twice a day).  No change in my skin condition.  Maybe I have to treat something internal.  I don&#x27;t know.  Too bad.  I had high hopes for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/6/13 - I changed my review from 2 stars to 4 stars because it may be working.  I use it morning and night to the affected area and swelling has gone down.  It&#x27;s not completely healed yet.  I started taking enzymes and other different pills so they may have done it too - I am not sure.  The area doesn&#x27;t itch like it used to.. but I think sometimes it does itch because I scratch at night and I see the area bleeding when I wake up.  Anyway... will let you know if it completely heals.  That will be a dream.  I&#x27;ve had the skin problem for over 10 years and I am very tired of it.  I went to dermatologist, spent over $700.  Even got cortizone shot which messed up my hormone and I will never do it.  Anyway, that didn&#x27;t heal it,, so I am expecting a lot from this cream.  Anyway, it&#x27;s been at least a couple of weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/15/13 - I am changing my review to 5 stars because I think it is working and I am ordering some more,, maybe it will clear in another couple of months.. hopefully.  I&#x27;ve had the rash forever and ever,,, and this is really a great improvement.</li>
    <li> Excellent product would recommend.</li>
    <li> it helps stop the itchiness at inverse psoriasis</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I purchased this for a sunburn that was peeling badly.  This stuff saved me!</li>
    <li> great product, I use it on my dog Tito he had a terrible rash, show it to my vet and said it was ok to use it on Tito. it has help him.  Thank you</li>
    <li> It works well in healing my child&#x27;s eczema.  While It doesn&#x27;t help with the itch, but helps smooth the rough skin back to a more normal appearance.</li>
    <li> love this cream. No fragrance, no mess, very healing. It&#x27;s the only thing that soothes my BF&#x27;s cracked skin. I&#x27;m on my third jar, and plan to purchase some for family.</li>
    <li> I have dishydrotic eczema on one foot that has been itchy to the point of making me insane.  It looked and felt so bad.  Dry, itchy, flaking skin, red... angry looking thing that had not healed up in two years. I have tried everything, cortisone cream and shots, vaseline, coconut oil, lemon, olive oil, something the naturopath gave me.. on and on, nothing worked.  Found this cream and have been applying it throughout the day.  At night, I put it on THICK and then wrap my foot lightly in handiwrap (plastic wrap) to hold in moisture (I highly recommend this, it really helps, I wear a sock to keep it all in place. )  My eczema is almost gone now, my skin looks &#x27;normal&#x27; for the first time in two years.  I am ordering at least two bottles of this now to replace the one I have used up.  I hope they don&#x27;t go out of business, I am thrilled with this product!!!</li>
    <li> Was not the right healing cream for me.  After using for a few days my skin was very dry and peeling which then left my skin raw and red</li>
    <li> I tried many failed products that would not clear up my skin. TriDerma has no unpleasant odor, is non- greasy and is very fast in healing. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Had no impact on my dry skin condition.</li>
    <li> Cure me here this ointment http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00195QEP0/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0</li>
    <li> Intense Healing Cream - I can say that it hasn&#x27;t hurt, but neither has it healed. I use it several times a day and always after I shave, but my beach walking (4 miles a day) may be too much for it or any cream?</li>
    <li> It helped will need to get more</li>
    <li> I think it did help initially when I first got my burn, but I&#x27;m not completely convinced of its effectiveness. I know it takes months for it to work, so I can&#x27;t say much, but my scar is still there. It is faint, so maybe it&#x27;s not as bad as it could have been without the cream. Hard to tell.</li>
    <li> Tried this because I have used several other of their products and found them all to be effective for the specific condition each addressed. This is an unscented white cream that has no greasy feel, absorbs quickly, and really seems to work on areas I have used it.I have very sensitive skin and have applied a small amount (it does not take much at all)  to itchy spots caused by allergies, to small burn from curling iron, to nicks around cuticles and dry fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Lol my sister took it from me so it works great.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for my hands!</li>
    <li> I was impressed by the delivery of the product as promised. I enjoyed the use of this product though it wasn&#x27;t what my skin needed. It appeared to assist with discomfort, but I needed something stronger.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cream for my grand daughter who suffers from eczema and my daughter in law says its great on her skin. Actually I haven&#x27;t even heard her complain anymore.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream due to the high rating. I have very dry skin on a elbow. The cream has not been my miracle cure. I had such expectations. I definitely would not put this cream on my face. Never.</li>
    <li> This is such great stuff!  Keeps my rosacea away, use it everything...breakouts, dry skin, (sun)burns, bee stings.  Works for and is easy on the dog too. A little goes a long way so a jar will last several months.</li>
    <li> I love this TriDerma intense fast healing cream. I apply it on my face every morning and night and really helped for very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I apply this cream also on my arms and legs and also I tried to apply it on my itchy scalp, wow it really worked. It also made my hair shiny and looks like I put hair conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have a really bad burn like 3rd degree on my ankle and front&lt;br /&gt;of my foot that is sooooooo irritating and can be painful. It&lt;br /&gt;itches constantly and can easily turn into a bloody oozing mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying this product along with pure Vitim E to try and get&lt;br /&gt;some moisture back into this old cooked flesh. I believe it is&lt;br /&gt;having an effect as the itching has subsided quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive, but if it works to help keep this very painful&lt;br /&gt;burn wound from driving me almost mad with it&#x27;s irritation..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll spring for it.</li>
    <li> DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL DO, HEALED MY RASH.</li>
    <li> This cream really helps the sores on my legs (from awful ingrown hairs) heal much faster than using nothing at all. It doesn&#x27;t do much for scars, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to.</li>
    <li> Great cream,  does what it says,  and is very effective.  I would  buy more when needed.  Thanks for the tips.</li>
    <li> works as it states!!! Love it!</li>
    <li> For soothing itching and promoting healing, this is the best cream or ointment that I have used for general skin care.</li>
    <li> Bought it for a pressure sore and couldn&#x27;t use it for it. I put it in the sore and it started burning and I had to wash it out immediately.  Also couldn&#x27;t use on the skin around the sore . It caused my skin to  burn. A total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this healing cream in the past with excellent results. This is the only product I&#x27;ve used on my cracked, peeling, scabby, elbows that ever cleared up the problem. If I could, I&#x27;d give it a 100 star rating.</li>
    <li> Healing my psoriasis!</li>
    <li> it does not help me- sorry, maybe i need something stronger. i am getting inserts with a higher archb to take pressure of that area.</li>
    <li> I use this product for everything  from scrapes to rashes &amp; breakouts.  I have never been more impressed with a healing cream!</li>
    <li> the actual product I got looked different, it was in a tube, but product and brand name all seem to be the same. I got this along with Healthy Hair Plus Anti-Fungual shampoo to treat some severe skin and scalp issues from seborraghic dermatitis and other skin/hair problems and/or changes associated with RSD/CRPS. For over two years the problems progressively got worse and worse. Went to two dermatologists (the first one told me to go see a shrink, the second just gave me an ointment and pretty much blew me off.... BECAUSE THEY WEREN&#x27;T FAMILIAR WITH  RSD/CRPS ) I have been suffering to the point I don&#x27;t even like to leave my house anymore, ever. I had horrible sores on my scalp, and now my hair is gone. I get bumps and extreme amount of sebum production to the point of having to shower twice a day, and still see evidence of my &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; everywhere I go (on my clothes, blankets, chair, etc) It is all over my face, neck, chest, back, shoulders, buttocks &amp; genital area &amp; even sometimes my legs. Tried coal tar shampoo, Head &amp; Shoulders, Selsun Blue, Tea Tree Oil (in oil &amp; in products), Neosporin, Hydrocortisone, alpha hydroxys, and on and on.... Never any luck. UNTIL NOW!!!! Within a week, the sores on my scalp were almost completely healed &amp; hair is sprouting a little bit, my skin was smoother, less &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; all over but especially my face. IT IS LITERALLY A MIRACLE!! Don&#x27;t know which product is doing it, or if its the combination of the two, but I will keep using them both and am praying to one day soon look and feel like a human being, or better yet an attractive female, again.</li>
    <li> HAVEN&#x27;T NOTICED THAT THIS WORKS INTENSELY FAST.  HOWEVER, GIVING IT A CHANCE.  HAVE NOT HAD THE PRODUCT VERY LONG AND ONLY USED TWICE.</li>
    <li> This was just what i hoped it would be, and I will order more as needed! The price was very good.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews unless I am astounded or terribly disappointed by a product. This cream is amazing and there really are not enough positive words to describe it. Let me explain..I have had only what I can describe as thick &#x27;patches&#x27; of dry skin on my face (of all places) and nowhere else, for 14 years now, only to be told by doctors and dermatologists that, of course, it is eczema, because lord forbid they actually put some effort into diagnosing a condition. Through my countless hours of research on eczema and what it looks like, along with other skin disorders, my &#x27;patches&#x27; never seemed to match up to anything specific. However, I have been prescribed the steroids and such (horrible for the face especially!) and they never did they did much of anything! I have been DESPERATE! I can&#x27;t even tell you the anxiety that having this on my face has caused. It has kept me from going out in public many days over the years because of embarrassment. Needless to say, I have tried so many products to no avail and spent hundreds of dollars I am sure. And each time I try something new, it is basically with the realization that it is not going to work because nothing has worked before. And even though I pray that each new product will work, I had pretty much accepted that I will deal with this the rest of my life. I had come across this product on Amazon while searching for yet something else for my skin and I had it in my cart for many weeks because, of course, I was skeptical and didn&#x27;t want to waste any more money or be let down once again. But something told me to try this and reading the other reviews, it seemed like this might actually work. I am SOOOO glad that I purchased this because IT ACTUALLY DOES WORK! And for my stubborn skin patches, that is saying something. I cannot even begin to express how grateful I am for this product. I have been using it for 10 days now and all but one of the worst patches are smooth, and the most stubborn one is well on its way to being normal also. Also, if you are prone to &#x27;picking&#x27; at your skin, I know it is hard, but stop, and allow this product to go through the process of healing your skin, because it will. All I can say is AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;February 14th, 2015 AMAZING Update&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to update my response because I thought it would be helpful to others who suffer from skin issues. This product is JUST AS AMAZING now, after using it for 9 months, as it was when I first started using it! It literally continues to save my skin (and my life) every day. I now get compliments on how beautiful my skin is, which I would have NEVER dreamed in a million years! I will NEVER be without it, and I will NEVER stop using it! I pray they never stop making this cream!</li>
    <li> Rich, creamy, healing and non-oily.  Perfect for my torso skin condition.  Very soothing and calming.  Super hydration properties, too!</li>
    <li> After writing  a negative review I contacted the manufacturer and received a very positive response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Hi Sheryl,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for bringing this to our attention.  I also saw a TV program on the destruction of the rain forest to harvest Palm Oil and was totally disgusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have stopped using Palm Oil in all our formulas and was surprised that the palm oil showed up on the 4 oz. jar label.  We will correct this right away on any new labeling going forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your kind information, and we applaud you for your interest in preserving the planet.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Gloria Vanderlaan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Triderma</li>
    <li> After dealing with a noticeable peeling, flaking, red skin condition on my arms for several years I was gifted a container of tri-derma to try. I was impressed enough to order several containers. I have applied it twice a day for two months and feel that my skin looks better and it definitely feels better. I&#x27;m a long way from &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34;, but am very pleased with the results...and the excellent price from this supplier.</li>
    <li> it was as advertised. thank you.</li>
    <li> Not sure what&#x27;s in it - but it is a great healing cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help heal a wound that was not healing very well. This item worked but I was hoping it would have worked a little faster. I could have been a bit more patient I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;I would still recommend this product to anyone looing for something like it. I like the fact that it contains virgin organic Aloe Vera, Zinc and vitamin A.</li>
    <li> This works wonders and I&#x27;m so glad I always know I can get it through Amazon</li>
    <li> Actually works on my feet!</li>
    <li> This cream spreads easy and soaks in. It is very soothing to skin and seems to aid to the healing process. Purchased for elderly lady who had facial scar and she commented that she liked the cream because it felt like silk going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHOW YOU CARE:&lt;br /&gt;I thought this healing cream along with a hope you heal soon card -  was very well received and made her very happy that someone cared about her. I think it was better than flowers or candy :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come as pictured 1st off and other than being lotion,I&#x27;m not sure if it does what it claims</li>
    <li> Great cream. Will help heal ulcers any where. Fast acting even cools the skin down so you don&#x27;t have that burn. Very good product. Great for cuts and burns too.</li>
    <li> I knew this cream already it&#x27;s very good for dry skin</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I will never be without it.</li>
    <li> Franly, I was quite surprised at how effective this cream is as a healing emolient for irritated skin, for&lt;br /&gt;pressure sores in particular as a preventive but also for an actual sore in the earlier stages. It is quite remarkable stuff but also expensive stuff. however, still worth it. I wish they had a subscribe and save program for this.</li>
    <li> My father is bed ridden and occasionally gets bed soars, this cream helps to heal them a lot  faster. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> An OK basic cream, but I can&#x27;t say it healed anything... I have several insect bites on my calves that have been slow to heal and I had hoped this would do the trick, but after two weeks of use I don&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I used up the whole jar-for the $ paid, it  did not do anything significant for my skin- so  I will go  back to using Gold Bond [and in my opinion, works far better].</li>
    <li> I have had a rash on both ankles for three years I ASKED FOR RELEIF FROM 3 DIFFERENT Doctors and they all said get whatever will help from a RX I tried at least 15 different products with no relief the next one I tried was Triderma Intense fast Healing and lo and behold it is working no more itching and the redness has almost gone. Thanks for the great product</li>
    <li> I truly recommend the tri derma items for people look into the products.  I am certain that they will agree with me about the quality of the products.  Betty</li>
    <li> I have to say after the first order was replaced as it arrived in plastic packaging and broken, the replaced product was of course free of charge and shipping and it has cleared the redness on my chin. No other product I&#x27;ve used has done this. The draw back is its very thick and even using a little and alot of circular rubbing it has a very grease like feel.</li>
    <li> Unable to quickly find the TriDerma Pressure Sore Relief Cream (which is the ultimate), I ordered this instead.  While it does give good relief for pressure sores, it does not seem to be the &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; salve of the preferred product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still recommend it for general healing of skin abrasions, etc.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. But the smell is medical. And it has alcohol in it so it stings. Else so far so good.</li>
