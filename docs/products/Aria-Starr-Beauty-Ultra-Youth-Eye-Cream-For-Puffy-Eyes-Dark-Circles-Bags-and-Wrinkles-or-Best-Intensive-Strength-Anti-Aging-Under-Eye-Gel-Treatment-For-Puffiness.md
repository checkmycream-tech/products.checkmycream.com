<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Working quite nicely. Feels great. It will take time to see true results but so far so good!</li>
    <li> Love this! This product actually does an amazing job of diminishing dark under circles. It also helped reduce some of the puffiness that I wasn&#x27;t aware I had. Leaving a bright and youthful look around my eyes. I am very impressed and can&#x27;t wait to share this product with friends.</li>
    <li> really helping on my puffy eye.  feeling more firm after few apply</li>
    <li> This gel has a pleasant scent and goes on nicely. Decrease the puffiness under my eyes very quickly.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the eye gel very long, but it is helping with the fine lines around my eyes and the puffiness. I will continue to use the product. Leaves a very cool feeling on your eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now and so far it&#x27;s been great.  Feels nice on my skin and does what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> Performance was very low grade.  Did not meet any of it&#x27;s claims.  I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm - Love it and fast shipping too !</li>
    <li> This is a great eye gel, you can feel it working just moments after its a applied</li>
    <li> I like it. I got a high discount code for buy it. it is good. I used it two days, the smell is good. for such a short time, I cannot tell much different, I will update after a while.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had enough time yet to rate it&#x27;s performance. Anxious to give it a good try.</li>
    <li> Feels great once you apply but then feels sticky after it begins to dry.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week now and I love the smell and how it feels on my dark circles! It&#x27;s made in the USA and is Leaping Bunny certified!  I am very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I am a 28 year old African /Irish American with extremely dark under eye circle (slight &#x27;raccoonish&#x27; like) and  sensitive skin. Pros : So far, I have noticed a slight lightening of my dark circles. It keeps my eye area moist. It is great for traveling, especially as a carry-on at only .5 oz. Cons: So far so good. I will update once I completely use my cream. (Please test a little on the back of your hand to test for sensitivity before use).</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and can use very few skin creams, eye gels, etc. I decided to try this and it didn&#x27;t burn my skin nor eyes. I wake up in morning without pulling in the eye skin area and looking</li>
    <li> Wonderful gel ! I have been going through cancer treatments and am not feeling very pretty right now... Your Eye Gel feels so nice going on and I believe I have been able to see a difference around my eyes. Thank You, Karen</li>
    <li> This is a light refreshing gel with a faint cucumber scent. My allergies tend to make the area under my eyes puffy and this gel is cooling and calming.Puffiness is greatly reduced. Perfect for allergy/summer season!</li>
    <li> Very soothing and smoothing</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally use a lot of wrinkle preventative stuff, but I&#x27;m not getting any younger.  I tried this eye gel, love it.  It&#x27;s smells like botanical garden, non greasy, easy directions and doesn&#x27;t burn or water my eyes.  Works best when used twice a day.  I&#x27;m looking forward to adding it to my daily regimen.  I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest, unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Love this, light so you can use under make up. Great product. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Puffiness is not decreasing as I had hope but I&#x27;m not giving up yet</li>
    <li> It seems like only a few years ago that I didn’t have a single wrinkle around my eyes nor a trace of a dark circle. Now it seems I find a new wrinkle every single day. So I’m always looking for eye creams and serums that will turn back the clock. I just started using this product, but here are things I already like about it.  -- It absorbs almost immediately and doesn’t leave a greasy residue that will end up in my eyes, especially when I sweat. -- I have sensitive skin, especially around my eyes. But this cream doesn’t cause any irritation. -- The skin around my eyes already seems smoother and less puffy. -- The botanical herbal scent is quite pleasant. -- No testing on animals, which is an absolutely vital characteristic when I’m considering new products. -- It’s made in the USA in an FDA-registered manufacturing facility. -- The one year, no questions asked, full refund policy means the company stands behind their product so there’s no risk involved in trying it.  I am very pleased with this product and definitely would buy it again. I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion, based on my personal experience. All comments are truthful, and the product absolutely has earned the rating I have given it.</li>
    <li> First off, I would like to say that this is the ONLY eye gel I have ever used that did not give me a horrible allergic reaction.  After the first application, I started to feel my eyes getting itchy, and I was worried, but it was just the product doing its job.  I had very puffy eyes from lack of sleep, and it did get rid of those.  It so far has not budged my dark circles, and that&#x27;s the only complaint I have, but I have only used it for 3 days, and I will update after a week or so.  I also noticed the product smoothing out the skin around the corners of my eye, so it is accurate on its claim to that. (I am a 29 year old female, if that helps for a reference)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of this product is great, it is very smooth and absorbs quickly.  It&#x27;s is a transparent formula, very silicon like, which I prefer.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about a white opaque product getting all clumpy.  The awaphui aroma is fantastic as well, smells just like the Awaphui shampoo from Paul Mitchell.  It also worked very well as a makeup primer, I know that isn&#x27;t the purpose, but it is a great bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I loved this product.  I have been looking for an eye product for awhile, and was starting to get discouraged by horrible allergic reactions (eyes swollen shut reactions).  I would like something to remove my dark circles, but like I said, I&#x27;m only 3 days in and I am hopeful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*update! I added a before and after picture so you all can see the progress!! My dark circles are still there, but MUCH less noticeable!!! Pictures don&#x27;t lie!</li>
    <li> The consistency of this product is wonderful. I love that just a little goes a long way. My skin looks much better after just a couple of weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try this at a reduced price, but my opinion is my own. Honestly, I haven&#x27;t seen any change color on my dark circles, but I like the way this eye gel feels on my skin.  I work the midnight shift so,  It might not be enough to help, since I sleep less then I should.I have only used it for a week, so I will definitely keep using it.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t change the color of my under eye,  i do like how hydrating it is. Shipping and packaging were perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of days now. Dark circles around my eyes are the monster of my life, I hated them, I have tried several eye products to remove them or at least lessen these dark circles but I have failed several times. This eye gel, which I got at a discounted price for testing and review purposes, is something that I&#x27;ll definitely keep. After just a few days of using this, I can already notice some difference around my eyes, dark circles are now lighter, and I can notice that the lines under my eyes were lessen, I like that this cream is cold when applied to the skin and it does not smell bad.</li>
    <li> Already can tell a difference! !!&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I am not noticing much difference after one week of use. Will keep trying.</li>
    <li> Love my new product, it is more of a gel then a cream and smells fantastic. I would like to comment more on the benefits but my mother keeps stealing it when she comes to visit. Thank you for an organic great smelling product made by a small business.</li>
    <li> I really like how cooling the Aria Starr Ultra Youth Eye Gel feels under my eyes after a long day. I&#x27;ve only been using this a few days now since it arrived. Already, I see the dark circles are already disappearing and the bags are less baggy.</li>
    <li> So far I don&#x27;t see a difference in my bags.  I don&#x27;t have big ones, but the puffiness under my eyes hasn&#x27;t sown a difference as of yet.</li>
    <li> Nice cooling effect and it reduces my dark circles.  Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye gel. The bottle is small enough to carry in my purse, but you only have to use a very small amount, so it will last a very long time. It has a nice light fresh sent. It dries quickly and isn&#x27;t sticky or heavy. The feel is refreshing and cool, which is very nice on a hot summer day.</li>
    <li> I love this eye gel! I can already see a difference in the under eye area especially</li>
    <li> I notice a big change in the skin around my eyes.  Way less puffy.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this gel! It&#x27;s not oily or doesn&#x27;t get in my eyes. It definitely made them less dark!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the eye gel for a week now and I am still trying the product. Hopefully I will get a good result!</li>
    <li> After only 2 wks it&#x27;s hard to tell any definite results regarding all this gel claims to do. But I like the soft, easy to dispense creamy like gel, which I can use sparingly at night and sometimes in the morning. It is not greasy, rather leaves a soothing, smooth feeling around your eyes. No problem to wear under makeup. I imagine in time I will notice a difference in the appearance of puffiness and fine lines. It is very reasonably priced, and I will order it again, since I have not noticed any better results with much more expensive eye creams in the past.</li>
    <li> I got this product at a reduced price to give a review. This product seems to be working pretty well On my face. It definitely moisens your face!!!</li>
    <li> Works great at doing what it says! The more I use this eye gel the better, brighter,  and more youthful my eyes look. I&#x27;m enjoying this product very much!  Thank u</li>
    <li> I just received the eye gel a couple of days ago, but so far I really like it. I received a discount code for this and as I would like to look younger thought I would give it a try. It feels very nice on my face and is not oily. After a few days, my wrinkles look lighter and had an immediate effect. Also, you only need to use a very small amount, so this bottle will last a long time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not oily.  Very easy to apply and rub in.  So far, I like it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product...it glides on smoothly, smells clean.</li>
    <li> This product has been a Godsend...I am 58 years old and have very sensitive skin on my face and the area around my eyes tends to be dry and becomes inflamed with certain products I&#x27;ve tried. This eye cream is very light and gel-like. It didn&#x27;t burn or sting when I applied it and soaked in almost immediately. It felt very soothing and I can see is helping keep the area around my eyes moisturized. The bottle is pretty small, but just a little dab on your fingertip goes a long way. It has definitely earned a spot in my beauty arsenal.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eye area!  This Ana Starr gel doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water either!  I have so many oils creams, lotions for my face but most of them say to avoid eye area. That&#x27;s my area that needs help the most!  I also keep this in the fridge since it&#x27;s summer &amp; it&#x27;s a great pick-me-up when you need it. It will take a lot of work to totally get rid of my puffy dark circles-it took me 65 years to get them!  But I do like the way it diminishes the look &amp; the cool refreshing feeling.  I did receive this eye gel at a reduced cost for an honest opinion.  It&#x27;s great &amp; it doesn&#x27;t cost $100! Thank You!</li>
    <li> Excellent for under my eyes---it soothes as it goes on. Great product!</li>
    <li> I HAVE REALLY GROWN TO LOVE ARIA STARR. THIS EYE GEL IS SO NICE. ITS LIGHTWEIGHT AND LEAVES YOUR EYES FEELING COOL. I USE IT BEFORE BED AND IT HAS REALLY REDUCED MY MORNING PUFFINESS. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST REVIEW. AND JUST LIKE THEIR RETINOL SERUM AND MUD MASK THIS EYE GEL HAS NOW BECOME I PERMANENT PRODUCT IN MY SKIN CARE ROUTINE :D</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see results at all !</li>
    <li> Been using for 3 1/2 weeks....absolutely no improvement in either under eye puffiness or crows feet.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I had an allergic reation. I will let my wife try it and will update later.</li>
    <li> Do like the cooling effect of this gel and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. After about a week of using it, it seems like it works. Seems like a found a great product for a high discount!</li>
    <li> Non- greasy. Like dispenser. Goes on smoothly. Feels soothing to the undereye area</li>
    <li> I love this eye gel!!  I clean my face every morning and night, then I apply this gel with my ring finger in the eye area and upper.  This product has given me a new life.  I feel and look younger!!!  Awesome and highly recommend to others who want to be younger again!</li>
    <li> This eye gel works great!</li>
    <li> I reviewed this product through Amazon Review Trader and so far I really like it. My face is looking good and it seems to be helping on some of my trouble areas.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!!. I have been using it for a week now and cannot say enough good things! The serum goes on smooth and does not feel sticky. There is no overwhelming perfume smell, just a light fragrance.. Cucumber, I think. This one is clearly a hit and I will be purchasing again.! I have already seen a noticeable difference in the wrinkles around my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;Received for honest and unbiased opinion</li>
    <li> Nice light creamy feeling! Use it every night!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical to try this since I have tried many but this not only helps my dark circles but also reduces my lines around my eyes as well! As a mom you can imagine I don&#x27;t much sleep and I was always looking tired. This has helped me tremendously</li>
    <li> This smoothes the wrinkles and takes away the puffy eyes. The rose scent doesn&#x27;t cut it. I absolutely do not like rose scented anything unless it is real roses.</li>
    <li> Have been using for almost a week....like the consistency....goes on easy, not sticky......</li>
    <li> Seems great so far. Goes on thin and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin or eyes. I will do another review after using for a few weeks in regards to the anti-aging results.</li>
    <li> This eye cream has a dewy feel and left my eyes feeling moisturized without being oily.  Helped some with the appearance of wrinkles, however did not make them go away.  Would continue to use to protect the delicate tissues around the eyes.</li>
    <li> So cool and soothing; love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times. I keep it in the fridge as another reviewer mentioned. Good ingredients and feels nice as you put it on. Seems to help w puffiness !</li>
    <li> I love this eye gel! It&#x27;s so refreshing and you can instantly feel the tightness around your eyes. I am an Esthetician, and am always looking for great new products, and am excited to be able to use this product on my clients!</li>
    <li> Great Product! This gel left my skin feeling and looking really nice!</li>
    <li> I think this eye gel is so good!! What I like about it is that it has vitamin E in it which is so healthy for your shin and it has plant stem cells and cucumber!! You can&#x27;t get any better than that in my book!! I like the way it makes the area under my eyes feel and look.Not so puffy anymore and smoother!! A great product!!</li>
    <li> Cucumber, aloe, Vitamin E, just looking at those 3 ingredients you&#x27;ll know for sure on how this Eye cream will feel on your eye! plus the other great main ingredients (Hyaluronic Acid + Matrixyl 3000 + Plant Stem Cells + Peptide Complex) you won&#x27;t just feel good but also look good! I have been trying this eye gel for about a week now and it was always a treat. It&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes or skin. My eyes don&#x27;t look tired and is more youthful with the fine lines diminishing. It has a very nice consistency and applies beautifully. Look vibrant with this eye gel! Got this product a great price to test and review. Opinions expressed are entirely my own. This is another great product from Aria Starr!</li>
    <li> Already have the product for one week I haven&#x27;t seen any results I still have puffy eyes dark circles and bags how long would you get to see the results??</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It feels great when I put it on and does what it&#x27;s meant to do. I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering again :) :)</li>
    <li> I love the product.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind and the puffiness beneath my eyes has almost disappeared!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Especially on the under-eye bags that appear every morning.</li>
    <li> This truly makes my eyes feel great and I definetly notice them looking great too!  I have enjoyed this from the first use and will continue to use it.  I have not found a product that works this good for my eyes in a long time..Thank you.</li>
    <li> I can only speak for myself, but I really like this product. My eyes are more youthful, the puffiness is down and the wrinkles are smoother. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the eye gel for about a week, but I am very happy.with the results that I&#x27;ve had in such a short period of time.</li>
    <li> A very pleasant eyegel! I was surprised how well, and fast!, it worked wonders. Puffiness gone. Dark shadows gone. Softer wrinkles. It&#x60;s just so good. Amazon gave me a discount to review this one, and I&#x60;m glad they did.</li>
    <li> I just received it but will tell that this goes on smooth.  I will post more once I&#x27;ve used it more.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and love how it tightens.</li>
    <li> Putting it on the back of one hand resulted in immediately moister, smoother skin with fewer fine wrinkles as compared to the back of the untreated hand. I put it on one eye and waited a half hour, then looked in the mirror. The deeper wrinkles looked the same, but there was a marked reduction in fine lines and my skin looked fresher and brighter around the eye I put the gel on. I&#x27;d rank this gel as excellent in terms of cosmetic effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a slippery gel feel going on (aloe is the second ingredient), then a fresh cooling sensation. Skin does not feel sticky after the gel has dried fully; until then there is a texture you can feel. It is completely non-greasy. The scent is mild (no added fragrance) and sort of an herbal cucumber essence. It stings a little for a minute if you get it in your eyes. Aside from that, it has a very cooling, refreshing feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In choosing skin care products, you need to know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects. Cosmetic effects are immediate and only there when the product has been applied that day - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product for a month (but don&#x27;t do that when you have something that works - your skin needs continued support if you want to delay signs of aging as much as possible). An ideal product would cover both needs fully, but it&#x27;s usually more realistic to realize a formula will tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this formula, the Matrixyl 3000, peptides, hyaluronic acid and some of the herbal ingredients should provide long-term support. The other ingredients are more oriented towards immediate, temporary improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
    <li> Did not get to use this product when it was delivered. The top of the bottle was busted and not able to use. So therefore, I am not able to use it. Thank you. And would appreciate it if you could replace this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product I use it at night and the results are amazing</li>
    <li> The size is very ideal and comfortable to use.It absorbs nicely and does not appear oily.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait for my eye gel to get here. I have ordered this product before. I have been waiting on it to be back on uberzon. I love this eye gel. I can tell a difference in my dark circles they have lightened up. My bags are shrinking.  I can also tell that my crows feet have diminished some. I love this product. I only wish that it came in a bigger size. Melanie Austin</li>
    <li> I got this product because I have very bad dark circles under my eyes. In fact, when I was younger, I was told I had raccoon eyes. Sadly, after a week of testing this, I didn&#x27;t see any change in that department. It is a good moisturizer though. It leaves your face feeling cool which is really nice on these 90 degree days. It also has a hint of cucumber scent which I loved. Last note, the bottle itself is pretty small as you can see in photo. I didn&#x27;t need to apply any more than a dime size at a time though.</li>
    <li> I have only had this for about a week but am already seeing some of the fine lines fading, looking forward to seeing results as I continue to use the product. I just use a very small amount to cover the area under my eyes so it should last quite awhile. I ordered this and received it in 2 days.</li>
    <li> Have used only a week.Cannot see any&lt;br /&gt;difference yet.Will give it another week or so.Thank You for your interest.</li>
    <li> Not the results I expected. I can&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
    <li> Fast service&lt;br /&gt;great product</li>
    <li> Firms, tightens and reduces puffiness - as advertised. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple days, twice a day, but the puffiness literally disappears in front of your eyes after applying. No word yet on if it helps with the dark circles though.</li>
    <li> I love this eye gel, I feel that results will be seen very soon.  Right away I can feel/see the&lt;br /&gt;fine lines around my eyes soften up.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results.  You only&lt;br /&gt;need just a small dab to cover both eyes.</li>
    <li> This is a must have!! Love it because having an infant I stay up a lot of nights I just apply this on in the morning and I can definitely tell a difference! I can feel it working on my skin!! I got this through AMZ review trader!</li>
    <li> I never react well to eye creams... until I got this one. Game changing oh my gosh...</li>
    <li> I just started using the Eye Gel, but I am starting to see a bit of a difference in the puffiness and lines under the eyes.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get my picture to load.  I dramatically reduced the lines around my eyes.  I did one eye only and results were visible in less than 4 minutes.  It did look like my eye was puffy but we later decided thats just because I didn&#x27;t have any wrinkles showing and thats why it looked like that.  I don&#x27;t do my hair and makeup everyday but I will add this to my daily routine because it knocks about 5 years off my eyes!  I did receive this product at a promotional price for my review and didn&#x27;t think that I would enjoy this product as much as I do!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now, it seems to be helping with the puffy-ness around my eye lids.  I have really puffy eye lids and since using this product for a while, they seem to have calmed a bit.  I will continue to use this product since there&#x27;s a little improvement.</li>
    <li> Gel formula pulls skin under eyes making more crow&#x27;s feet. That area is supposed to be handled as gently as possible. Not good. Make it a light cream.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery and exemplary customer service. Merchant very reliable. The Gel did not well on me  but since each person&#x27;s eye problem is unique, the Gel might work well for others. I recommend you try it.</li>
    <li> This stuff feels great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes! Absolutely pleased with my purchase and would recommend to others!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply. Does the job quickly. Can apply make up over without issues.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Works great after the very first use!  It is a nice size.   It has a very nice consistency.   Not at all greasy.... which is a huge plus because otherwise it would get all over my bed linens.  Super happy with this purchade.</li>
    <li> Love the quality of this product! Feels very good on my skin and smells so clean! will be purchasing this again very soon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the eye gel for about a week.  I&#x27;ve been using my old gel under one eye and this gel under the other.  It feels cool and refreshing with a slight cucumber scent.  Thus far I haven&#x27;t seen any difference between the eyes.  I had hoped to see some of the swelling reduced and also the darkness under the eye reduced.  As I stated its only been a week and I will continue using it with the hope that continued use will bring results</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, too soon to tell if it work but I like the smell and the consistency of it, and it makes my skin feel really great!</li>
    <li> I loved the feel and puffiness was gone in three days</li>
    <li> actually I haven&#x27;t been able to use it because the container isnt working</li>
    <li> Very nice, smooth gel. I like the feel of it and it keeps my under eyes moisturized all day.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference with the puffiness under my eyes after a few weeks of using this product.</li>
    <li> Too soon to see the different just yet.....I&#x27;ll give it a little more time.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this eye gel very long but the puffiness around my eyes seems to be somewhat reduced and the cucumber scent is refreshing.</li>
    <li> I am excited to try out this product! The item was shipped quickly and with no problems. I love using this in the morning. It cools my tired eyes. I will keep using andvhopecthqt my bag disappear!</li>
    <li> First off, I have tried many eye creams. None of them are miracle workers, especially if you continue to run on minimal sleep and rub your eyes (I am guilty of both). After using this product for only a few days, this is what I noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the smell is not unpleasant. It smells like fresh cut cucumber. I actually like the smell of cucumbers so that&#x27;s a plus. The smell is also not overpowering. One thing I like about eye gels is that they are cooling, this one is no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my eyes seem as though they are less puffy since starting to use this product, my dark circles are still fierce. I will continue to use this product until it is gone. I really don&#x27;t feel that I can write a great review until 30 days after I start using a product, but this one is promising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of different things, but this product does not bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that at this price point, this product is definitely worth a shot, just don&#x27;t expect it to work miracles. No product that says they get rid of under eye circles actually does remove them completely. This is definitely something that could be part of a daily routine and beneficial to the skin.</li>
    <li> Received this product for review. Love this item! I think with more time, I&#x27;ll get better results. I&#x27;ll update in a 1-2 weeks!</li>
    <li> i received this product for review but that in no way affects my opinions. this is a very moisturizing eye cream, and its a gel formula which works ideally with oily skin. i&#x27;m loving it!</li>
    <li> This gel is more effective for reducing puffiness than any  other gels I have used, regardless of the price.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for a couple of days and haven&#x27;t seen much results, but it has reduced some of my puffiness.</li>
    <li> Great eye gel!  I have sensitive eyes and this was not bothersome at all. Actually very refreshing feeling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very prone to milia around my eyes, so I&#x27;m always careful what kind of eye cream I use. I love that this eye gel is only just a tad thicker than serums, and they are absorbed by my skin very easily, leaving a smooth finish. This is a fairly small bottle, but you don&#x27;t need a full pump to cover both your eyes. It should last at least 2-3 months unless you&#x27;re using it for your whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles, yet, but I do get very puffy eyes from a medication that I&#x27;m on. It&#x27;s frustrating to wake up every morning and look like I&#x27;m sleep-deprived or hungover. I usually have to put on a lot of eyeliner to make my eyes look a little more energetic. But I was afraid to put on heavy creams because of my milia problems, so this eye gel was the perfect solution. I&#x27;ve tried hyaluronic acid and peptide complex on my eyes before, and they didn&#x27;t do anything, so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s different about this particular gel that helps with the puffiness but it does. Maybe it&#x27;s the cucumber, who knows. But it has a nice, cooling effect when I applied it and my eyes look much better afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this helps with my puffy eyelids, I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s strong enough for wrinkles. The hyaluronic acid can certainly help firm and hydrate the skin, though I think if wrinkles is your main concern, you might want to put on some retinol serum before applying this eye gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about this eye gel is that it absolutely does not leave any residue after application. It sinks in right away so you can use this in the morning without worrying it will make make up application difficult. And if you have milia problems like I do, this is perfect because it won&#x27;t clog your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review, but I was not obligated to leave a positive review. I always test products on my own skin before leaving a review, and never recommend something that doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Received yesterday,  I like this eye gel alot, looking forward to results, fast shipping! !</li>
    <li> So far so good. Smells like soothing cucumber.  Feels cool and light to the touch.</li>
    <li> I received the product on time. Though I used the product only for few days I was able to see the difference. With continued use it should give good results. Thank you for the product at discounted rate.</li>
    <li> I use this on the rare days that I wake up tired and with puffy eyes.  It smells good and is refreshing.  Love the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love how this eye gel feels on my tired eyes. It&#x27;s cooling, and the cucumber scent is very refreshing. I also like that this is a gel instead of a greasy cream. It feels great to apply and I like how it makes my skin feel. After using this product for about a month now, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes in my eye area however. I don&#x27;t have any big eye problems like dark circles of puffiness, but my crow&#x27;s feet have remained about the same, and on the occasion that I don&#x27;t get enough sleep and my eyes are a bit puffy, I don&#x27;t really notice any significant change there either. Others seem to have had good luck with this product though! I will continue to use until I run out and will update this review if anything changes.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt; To me it is very necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thank you</li>
    <li> Really loving this eye gel! The consistency is like a smooth gel. The soft smell of cucumbers is very pleasant. This can be worn under makeup which is how I like to use it.  When I am moisturizing my face in preparation for makeup I apply this to my eye area. I have seen the puffiness improve instantly. I feel like the darkness is starting to fade. This is a fantastic eye gel.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided</li>
    <li> Good product. Very emollient and moisturizing. Would recommend</li>
    <li> Love the product! Customer service is amazing and quick shipping!</li>
    <li> This is a great eye gel. It helps with puffiness, dark circles and wrinkles. I don&#x27;t really have much of an issue with dark circles under my eyes but when I use this, it lightens and brightens that skin. Loving the way it helps with puffiness.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Love how this product feel when it is put on under my eyes.  Soft.</li>
    <li> Great things come in little packages! This product seemed to have some results after just a few applications. would definitely say it is worth a try.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a good week and I am happy with the results.  Smells good, nice gel texture.  My eyes seem to be not as puffy in the morning and the area just looks more hydrated.  I&#x27;d give this a try if you haven&#x27;t been happy with other products.</li>
    <li> Nice Eye Gel. Soothing and cooling. It definitely reduces my morning eye puffiness, this I really notice. I&#x27;m not sure yet if it is making any positive changes to wrinkles, it&#x27;s too soon to tell. The ingredients are wonderful and it&#x27;s made in the USA. A little dab of it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this eye gel as a promotional item, to sample and leave my honest and objective opinion of it.</li>
    <li> This Aria eye gel helped the first day I used it. It helped my puffiness to go down and added some firmness.&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount to try this product and give my honest opinion</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically have under eye problems, but use this product as a preventive measure.  I trust Aria Starr Beauty products with my sensitive skin and gluten allergies.  It is nice to be able to trust the products  I put on my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having some sleep issues lately which leads to puffy swollen eyes. I&#x27;ve also hit that age where you look in the mirror one day and go &#x27;wow&#x27; and wonder how you failed to notice those wrinkles. I hunted around a while because I wanted something that was all natural and that you can really use on your eyes. It amazes me how many &#x27;eye&#x27; products have fine print labels that say &#x27;do not use on or near the eyes&#x27;. Kind of defeats the purpose...&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this product CAN be used safely around the eye area, even if you have sensitive skin. It is not oily, nor does it have the alcohol feeling to it. It&#x27;s slightly watery, but that&#x27;s a good thing because it spreads easily and without pulling on sensitive skin. It absorbs quickly with no residue or sticky after effect. After a few minutes, you can see that the skin has absorbed it and is holding it in which plumps up the wrinkles. It works great alone, such as at bedtime, or under makeup. I like the natural products and plan to continue using it for the forseeable future.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product used once and can see a small difference</li>
    <li> I think is a total waste of money this product doesn&#x27;t deliver what they promise, you get better results from a regular aloe vera gel than this watery gel</li>
    <li> Since I have received this product I have been able to wake up with my eyes looking a lot better. I use to have bags underneath my eyes and tired looking eyes when I woke up. But since I started using this a week ago its really made a huge difference on my eyes in the morning. I wake up and my eyes look a lot more refreshed and awake. Shipment came extra fast which I loved as well. I have used tons of fancy creams for my eyes that are suppose to work immediately and none I have used that works as well as the Aria Starr Beauty Ultra youth eye cream. What can I say more than I just love it. Its an overall great product if you need something to help tired puffy looking eyes.</li>
    <li> This has done wonderful things for me. I have eye issues that cause me so be very sensitive to light. Even with sunglasses I squint. That has caused early wrinkles. This has made them so much less noticeable. I use it wherever I want on my face. I have sensitive skin so I was suprised at how good it worked without causing irritation</li>
    <li> I am glad I purchased your product. I enjoy the cooling effect when I first apply around my eye area&#x27;s. I am starting to see my circles are improving and I am noticing my upper eye skin is not as saggy as before.  I would purchase your product again and would recommend it to other people with eye problems... Thankyou</li>
    <li> I recently developed bags under my eyes. Previously never had been an issue. This eye cream is working so well to reduce bags and puffiness</li>
    <li> I love the way this product feels on your skin.  You can feel it tightening up around the eyes and, as a bonus, I use it around my nose and mouth.  I think it is an excellent product and continue to use it.  I will see about the dark circles and revisit my review if it does not work as it says.</li>
