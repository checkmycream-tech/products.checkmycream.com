    <li> I like that you can adjust the thickness and that they don&#x27;t get cotton &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; all over the place.  Goes well with the finger clip things.</li>
    <li> They leave fibers behind. Great for taking off regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> Needed these so bad as I was using cotton wool pads to wipe off sticky residue off gel nails and to clean base nails and I always found I had bits of cotton stuck on my fingers which meant they&#x27;d get in the gel polish etc - ball ache! So these lil lint free fellas are perfect! :) Thanks!</li>
