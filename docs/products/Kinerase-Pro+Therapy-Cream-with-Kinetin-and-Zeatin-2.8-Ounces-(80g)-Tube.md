      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
      <li>As a 50 + year old with both dry and oily skin, this product is the best moisturizer!</li>
      <li>Will purchase it again and recieved the product quickly.</li>
      <li>THE NEW KINERASE PRO+THERAPY CREAM WITH KINETIN &amp; ZEATIN IS EVEN BETTER.</li>

      <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m no longer getting breakouts around my chin area (likely due to hormones) and I am very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a kinerase product</li>
      <li>but of course his price was much higher.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought higher end products like Estee Lauder and La Prarie, but had break-outs with them too.  </li>
      <li>i have been using kinerase since it first came on the market thru the dermos office over a decade ago..  </li>
      <li>Glad that Amazon gave me an opportunity to find it finally.</li>
      <li>Bought the first one from the dermatologist office.</li>

      <li>I love this product, I have very dry skin</li>
      <li>It is smooth going on-goes into the skin doesn&#x27;t just give a topical appearance.  </li>
      <li>This really really works.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
      <li>I am older with dry skin &amp; Many allergies with products.  </li>

      <li>This is a new one for me.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and have never had a problem with the product.  </li>
      <li>Investing in this book is worth it in the long run, you will definetly not overpay for cosmetic products again</li>
      <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve order this product from amazon (the last time was 7-12) when one tube was good and the other was similarly stinky.  </li>
      <li>and I am sooooo excited to find it here online for a lot less than what it sells for in the stores around here.</li>
      <li>So much frustration and difficulty getting my money back.  </li>

      <li>I love Kinerase, but this seller is very dishonest.  </li>

      <li>I have dry, sensitive skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I stumbled onto this product when I got some free samples at my dermatologist&#x27;s office.  I really loved it, but the doctor&#x27;s office was selling them for a much higher price (around $135 I think).  So, I decided to find out if I can get it cheaper elsewhere, and found it on Amazon for around $90.  Before I found this, I broke out often with various moisturizers.  I&#x27;ve bought higher end products like Estee Lauder and La Prarie, but had break-outs with them too.  This product worked for me and I did not break out using this product.  For me, it is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 6 months. I think this works even better than Kinerase with just the kinetin which I&#x27;ve also used. My skin looks clearer and less photo-damaged, altough my large brown spots will need something stronger than this. This product doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin and is moisturizing enough to use even during dry winter months.</li>
    <li> Within weeks my face started to look more even toned and more youthful. I love this product, I have also purchased the Kinerase Por Therapy Ultrarich Day repairand Night repairs creams!</li>
    <li> Kinerase has the best products. I am older with dry skin &amp; Many allergies with products.  I have NO problems with the Kinerase Products. It is smooth going on-goes into the skin doesn&#x27;t just give a topical appearance.  It is fragerance free so can be worn day time with no offensive odors.  I just love the Kinerase cream with Z&amp;K.  It gets 5 stars from me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different face creams, looking for specific results. This one is the best yet. I have skin that is easy to upset with products, so the fact that it doesn&#x27;t break me out is great. Better than all of that, the  uneven skin tone and premature wrinkles from years of sun damage have lessened and my pores appear less enlarged. Overall, in a short period of time, this cream has delivered on helping the appearance of my complexion. I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Again, I wasted my money.  I should ALWAYS take heed in the sound advice I read from the masterful cosmetic cop Paula Begoun in her book \\&quot;Don&#x27;t Go To The Cosmetics Counter Without Me\\&quot;.  Investing in this book is worth it in the long run, you will definetly not overpay for cosmetic products again and you will choose the correct product for your skin type.  I blew it again!!  Could have gotten the same ingredients in a less expensive brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about a month and my skin feels smoother and clearer.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a kinerase product and I&#x27;m typically not keen on using expensive products, but by the advice of my dermatologist, I decided to give this a shot.  I chose to purchase to product off amazon because it was substantially cheaper (~$35 less than at the derma) and I got free shipping.  I&#x27;m no longer getting breakouts around my chin area (likely due to hormones) and I am very happy with this product. Previously I had used oil of olay and obaji products and I was still breaking out.</li>
    <li> Bought the first one from the dermatologist office. It lasted for one whole year! Bought my second one on Amazon because it was $40 cheaper! Works great on my skin, making the pores look small and my skin looking smoother! Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I have very dry skin and this is the only face cream I have found that is not greesy and it actully works!</li>
    <li> I like Kinerase with zeatin cream better that most moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried (including Strivectin).  It goes on smooth and I have been using it every night.  I am on my second tube.  If only it could be a little less expensive!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best cream out there. Takes crows feet away in weeks. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. Even use it on my lids and in weeks the wrinkles have diminished.</li>
    <li> This really really works. But you must be patient and give it time. My skin doc reccomended it for me. I love the results and the price. Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> My skin has never been better.  I have VERY sensative skin and this never causes any grief.  I recently saw a friend I hadn&#x27;t seen in years and she commented on how good my skin/face looked.  Try it!</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with the product and will be returning both tubes of cream. It seems both tubes have gone bad, as the cream stinks and the color is brownish. This is the second time I&#x27;ve order this product from amazon (the last time was 7-12) when one tube was good and the other was similarly stinky.  I wonder if Kinerase knows of this inferior quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Kinerase for years, and I love it.  I have very sensitive skin and have never had a problem with the product.  Thought I&#x27;d try the Kinerase with Zeatin.  My skin got red from it after using it for several days. I usually get inflammed and swollen if a product doesn&#x27;t agree with me, so if I just got red, it may work well for others who don&#x27;t have sensitivity problems. It is less expensive than straight Kinerase.</li>
    <li> The product is over-rated.  Expensive.  I can find the same ingredients at a drug store a lot less costly.&lt;br /&gt;But my Sister-In-Law loves it!  LOL</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.... HAVE BEEN USING KINERASE CREAM FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND THE NEW KINERASE PRO+THERAPY CREAM WITH KINETIN &amp; ZEATIN IS EVEN BETTER. I WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT!</li>
    <li> I have dry, sensitive skin.  For the past 8 years, I have used Kinearase in combination with some Obagi products.  I have had excellent results.</li>
    <li> i have been using kinerase since it first came on the market thru the dermos office over a decade ago..  I had severe discoloration and today you would never know.  It is also an excellent moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Kinerase and I am sooooo excited to find it here online for a lot less than what it sells for in the stores around here. I am turning 40 and this product works fantastic!!! I LOVE IT!!! Will purchase it again and recieved the product quickly. Thank You that was so easy and I am extremely pleased.</li>
    <li> Creamy. I&#x27;ve used their products for years and am very happy with the results. This is a new one for me. I also ordered the night cream. Very good also.</li>
    <li> I am 63 and have been looking for something that works just for ME.  Everyone is different; now after all these years, I think I have found it. Can&#x27;t promise that you&#x27;ll like it, too, but it certainly is working for me.  Glad that Amazon gave me an opportunity to find it finally.</li>
    <li> I have been using Kinerase products for over 10 years. As a 50 + year old with both dry and oily skin, this product is the best moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I purchased Kinerase Pro Therapy cream along with Kinerase Pro Therapy C8 Peptide.  I have used Kinerase products for many years and have always been very happy with them.  In this particular order, I was happy with the cream but not with the C8 Peptide.  The cream was fresh and just what I expected.  The C8 Peptide was all dried out and seemed old.  I would be cautious about ordering from skincareusa.com</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and really works. It is very pricey tho but also lasts a very long time. As soon as I can afford will reorder</li>
    <li> I love Kinerase, but this seller is very dishonest.  So much frustration and difficulty getting my money back.  He also shorted me&lt;br /&gt;$10.00.  If it was for postage, that is wrong.  I just wanted to exchange and he said he could not get this from the manufacturer any more.  I see now that it is still on Amazon at a higher price!  I would still like my $10.00 back.!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  It gives you moisture as well as not&lt;br /&gt;leaving your skin shiny. It lasts a long time, and being in a tube your&lt;br /&gt;fingers are not touching the product to contaminate it. I have used it&lt;br /&gt;for the last 3 yrs. and am very pleased with the results. I am in&lt;br /&gt;my 60&#x27;s and get comments on my skin.</li>
    <li> Dermn doc said to get this but of course his price was much higher. Works like retin-A but goes on smooth. second order. Afraid to stop using!</li>
