<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing sunscreen! Works well for even my oily skin. Does not burn eyes</li>
    <li> Not oily, good for summer.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is very light weight and easy to apply on face every morning or whenever you need it (my suggestion is to apply every 2 hours if you are in the sun).&lt;br /&gt;The seller has a great communication skill. They respond to your email so quickly and they are very reliable and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> I use this mainly on my face because the bottle is quite small (for my body I would use blue lizard baby sunscreen SPF 30). I love how I can spread it on my skin so easily. I&#x27;m very oily, so this makes my skin look nice and matte. I apply bb cream over it, and from what I&#x27;ve seen there is no streaking whatsoever. I have purchased in total four bottles of this, and I am loving it!!</li>
    <li> I have very oily, acne prone skin that is sensitive. I have (and I know this is horrible) neglected to use sunscreen in my routine for the most part because they are always too heavy, too greasy, and break me out. Even oil-free options feel gross on my face. This product is so light and watery and it absorbs right into my face and leaves no film or greasiness behind. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week with no acne or increase in blackheads or oiliness. The shipping did take awhile but considering how inexpensive this is compared to what I&#x27;d pay for an American product at a drugstore in the U.S. it is totally worth the wait. I think I&#x27;ve found my every day sunscreen!</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen with a light tangy scent. Didn&#x27;t break me out and offers outstanding sun protection.</li>
    <li> Light weight and not sticky. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin . Whenever I use a sun creams, i immediately have skin problems, acnes etc It is a very light cream. With this cream, i do not have any problems and it really protects my face from sun. Today I received quite an amount of sun light and my face still seems ok . With this price it works well.</li>
    <li> took a long time to arrive from Japan. and it came with a KitKat bar which was odd. I still haven&#x27; eaten it lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watery based lotion. Whatever Biore uses in their product slightly feels like alcohol but is not irritating. I like it.</li>
    <li> This product is non-greasy and goes on your face very easily, without laving your skin shinny. The smell is pleasant and not overpowering.  Many sunscreens seem to lead to acne breakouts, but this product does not.</li>
    <li> I liked this but for me it did smell too alcohol-y for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;It did a good job of moisturizing my skin and it was very light; it did not make me oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone who has super oily skin but my skin is more combination so I switched back to a different moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is my new &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; product. Most sunscreens can be chalky and have an unpleasant texture that will complicate, if not ruin, your everyday makeup routine. However, this product makes applying makeup easy. It moisturizes your skin while protecting you from UV radiation which in turn prevents signs of aging on your skin. It&#x27;s a water based sunscreen which simply means that it&#x27;s not thick and creamy, and also absorbs faster into your skin. I have some trouble spots on my face and this product didn&#x27;t irritate them at all; no breakouts!! For those concerned about scent, there&#x27;s a very light, &amp;#34;barely there&amp;#34;, citrus scent that won&#x27;t perfume your skin. As applying sunscreen is a very important step in maintaining healthy, youthful skin, I highly recommend buying this product and adding it into your daily routine.</li>
    <li> This is okay.  I personally prefer using physical sunscreens because i have dry sensitive acne prone skin. I am surprised I did not break out from this sunscreen because it&#x27;s a chemical sunscreen. I do like the finish it gives. It&#x27;s a matte finish but not too drying.  It also leaves no white cast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to love these sunscreen as my holy grail. If only it was a physical sunscreen and more hydrating.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen, it makes my face feel soft and I was scared of using sunscreen due to the white cast and the greasy feel. I will repurchase when I run out. It came pretty fast too :) It feels like a moisturizer and I definately feel protected and I have not broken out from it.</li>
    <li> Nice sunscreen protector.</li>
    <li> Love it ! Doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy or pill up over my moisterizer</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this sunscreen! A lot of the Western sunscreens are super thick with a terrible smell. This goes on very well! It feels like I&#x27;m putting a water consistency on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin and very acne prone. This does not give me a break out. I will repurchase!</li>
    <li> Sunblock was never a big deal for me (I&#x27;m a Filipino chick, and tan instead of burn) growing up until I hit 20 and discovered my first wrinkle. Since then, it&#x27;s been a long road to finding this stuff. Normal sunblock makes my skin sting and burn like hell. When I found a &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; one that didn&#x27;t, it had such a white cast that I had to thin it down so I wouldn&#x27;t look sickly. Even then I put makeup over it because it also left a sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunblock does none of those things to me, the citrus cent is so pleasant and ever so light that it doesn&#x27;t bother me (I suffer from eczema and sensitive to smells). It doesn&#x27;t stick around after you apply it, and every time I do it&#x27;s like catching a whiff of a ripe orange. The texture is like a really good lotion; easy to smooth/pat onto skin, and quickly absorbs. I can wear it on its own or under bb cream, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to react to any of my toners/essences. This stuff is AWESOME. Repurchasing forever.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best facial sunscreen I have purchased. It applies easily, absorbs into my skin quickly, and dries within a minute or two without giving my skin a greasy look. I had previously used Neutrogena&#x27;s dry touch sunscreen, but I always disliked the whiteness is left on my skin, along with the greasy look and feel. This sunscreen goes on clear, and does not make my face oily or shiny. It also works well under makeup.</li>
    <li> SPF 50 no weird smells, no greasy after look and feel, very light and goes on beautifully. I really like this product tried it as a sample and had to purchase it. If you have sensitive skin and need a strong SPF without all the chemical s that go with it this is the product to buy. I would definitely buy it again for summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have brown skin so I only use SPF 50 during summer and SPF 15 during winter.</li>
    <li> I have recently been prescribed a topical cream (tretinoin) to treat mild acne. However, the initial side effects of the cream is that it makes my skin really dry/sensitive until I become acclimated (which could be weeks - months depending on the individual). During my treatment, it is required that I wear sunscreen- even on cloudy days. I&#x27;ve tried a few different sunscreens, and this was the only one that didn&#x27;t sting my skin when applied. It goes on really smooth and leaves your skin with a soft, matte finish. This sunscreen and an exfoliator called Cure Natural Aqua Gel have been my go-to products while I am recovering from acne treatment. These water-based products are incredibly gentle and effective with sensitive skin, I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> So I have tried so many other different brand of sunscreen (Hawaiian Tropic, Banana Boat, Neutrogena, Trader Joe&#x27;s), and this is by far the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. I wish I found it sooner - it only took me 22 years to find the perfect sunscreen. I&#x27;m a huge proponent of wearing sunscreen everyday. For those who care about anti-aging regimen, it&#x27;s been supported time and time again in numerous studies that not wearing sunscreen can age you faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer have to dread slathering on sunscreen in the morning and reapplying it throughout the day because of how perfect this sunscreen is. I also am no longer itching to go home and wash my sunscreen off immediately with this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, unlike most Western sunscreen, this one doesn&#x27;t make you feel oily, slick, or greasy. It actually dries matte and has a very nice finish, feels very lightweight on my skin, and feels very hydrating. My makeup actually goes on a lot better with wearing this sunscreen. Moreover, it has a very pleasant but light smell too - the smell reminds me of vanilla when I first apply but for those with fragrance sensitivity - no worries, the scent goes away fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen feels pleasant, doesn&#x27;t break me out, doesn&#x27;t drip and irritate my eyes, and most importantly, protects me from the sun. I actually ordered this from a Japanese retailer on Amazon and received it within two weeks in the US as well, for those wondering about how long it might take to ship, though of course YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With proper everyday use on your face, this bottle should last you about a month. I actually use a different sunscreen for my body (Trader Joe&#x27;s brand sunscreen) since it&#x27;s a little bit cheaper and my body is not as exposed to the sun as my face is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought many tubes of this product. It&#x27;s great under make-up, as it is very light and absorbs quickly. Please note that the shipping time is slow since this is a foreign item; keep an extra tube on hand if this is one of your &amp;#34;must haves&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have normal/sensitive skin, and generally react to physical sunscreens. Tried this after a recommendation on SkincareAddiction mentioned how gentle it is. It&#x27;s lived up to everything I read, and then some - absorbs quickly, not even a little greasy, and doesn&#x27;t sting or burn at all - no reaction! Very happy with it, and really the only thing I&#x27;m waiting for at this point is some sun so that I can actually determine whether it protects me as well as I hope it will.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t break me out and it feels so light and natural on my face! Love this! I usually hate sunscreen because of the smell and the oily feeling but this was excellent, I feel like I didn&#x27;t even put anything on.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things it is NOT: runny, white, pasty, smelly, globby&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Properties it does have: beautiful silky consistency that absorbs into skin perfectly, smells great, leave absolutely NO color cast on face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall five stars. My only complaint is the small size. I wish there was a bigger size than this but alas I will just purchase 3 more bottles now.</li>
    <li> This is the holy grail of all sunscreens!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like most other sunscreens.  I use it on my face as it doesn&#x27;t make it oily or greasy looking, but since it&#x27;s such a small bottle I use a different product on the rest of my body (L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Sun Broad Spectrum SPF 30).  I don&#x27;t mine so much if my body appears oily.  I plan to purchase this again!  Going on more than a year now that I&#x27;ve been using the same bottle, but I admittedly haven&#x27;t used it daily.  I have systemic lupus erythematosus so sun protection is mandatory, even indoors.  Money is tight so even small purchases like this are rough.</li>
    <li> Offer high SPF protection with PA+++. After I put it on I love how it doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast and it leaves my skin feeling SUPER smooth. Being a college student and a commuter I wear this everyday to avoid harmful sun exposure. I hope they never stop making this since it&#x27;s the only sunscreen that is suitable for my asian skin. Love it and I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is that this contains alcohol so make sure you have a good moisturizer to hydrate your skin after use. Will be buying more of this in the future.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen has been really great for my oily skin.  I&#x27;ve struggled for a long time to find a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t turn me into a greaseball and break me out and I have finally found one.  This isn&#x27;t as thick as most sunscreens so it absorbs really fast.  It even seems to mattify my skin.  There is also no white residue.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s common knowledge that slathering on sunscreen everyday is the #1 way to delay the merciless hands of time (not to mention skin cancer prevention), but I&#x27;ve had trouble following this advice because all the sunscreens that I&#x27;ve tried feel like I&#x27;ve wrapped my face with a layer of greasy saran wrap...until I can across Biore Sarasara. This sunscreen has high SPF, is lightweight, and goes well under makeup. It&#x27;s definitely the most wearable sunscreen that I&#x27;ve come across so far and serves as my current everyday sunscreen. However, it doesn&#x27;t get a full five stars for the following two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The water base that makes this lightweight also makes this not waterproof. So if you run/sweat/swim, make sure to go with a waterproof alternative.&lt;br /&gt;2. Alcohol content in this is high, so it might not be best for those with very sensitive skin. Even for those whose skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, make sure to properly moisturize/hydrate before putting this on (I recommend wearing the Hadalabo Gokujun Hyaluronic Lotion underneath)</li>
    <li> I love this lotion--goes on smooth, not at all greasy, and my face absorbs it almost immediately.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and the product works like a dream! I use this every day and it leaves my skin with a soft and smooth finish! I will totally be buying this product again! ^_^</li>
    <li> Got sun burned when using this.</li>
    <li> Matte with a slight dewy finish, absorbs well. Love! Can&#x27;t wait to use the new 2015 version.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen that I have used. Very light on skin can use with make up you may apply many times during the day. perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I have used other brands such as Vichy, La roche and Biore is much better</li>
    <li> Love this product. Have been using it everyday.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t even feel like you&#x27;re wearing sunscreen</li>
    <li> It is chemical spf (not physical), so use antioxidant cream underneath or in the evening.</li>
    <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews but this product is amazing. Every sunblock I&#x27;ve tried gives me a rash and I have fair skin so I was starting to despair of ever being able to go out in the sun. I found this product mentioned on a blog, ordered it, and have been amazed both at how it doesn&#x27;t give me an itchy rash and it is so light I actually LIKE wearing it! I just ordered more because I am now unwilling to ever go without this sunscreen again!</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen! More watery formula than most sunscreens, and dries quickly with no residue. Feels like you&#x27;re not wearing sunscreen at all.</li>
    <li> Great sunblock, but this tiny bottle will last you only one full body application. If you really cover yourself with this sunblock completely, you will run out in one use.</li>
    <li> Great workhorse, not oily or powdery</li>
    <li> Finally, a sunscreen that&#x27;s high on SPF but feels weightless on the skin !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No sunscreen smell.&lt;br /&gt;No white film residue that leaves your skin sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a GREAT product!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. She says it is what she wanted from a friend&#x27;s referral. I don&#x27;t know if it works as expected. I assume so.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen ever!  Not greasy, oily, smelly at all unlike most US drugstore sunscreens.  This sunscreen is more like a liquid than a thick cream; and by a few minutes after application it feels like nothing at all on your skin.  Seriously.  It is winter here, with only diffuse sunlight, so I haven&#x27;t had a chance to give it a test drive under full summer sun, but if it continues to perform as it does now, and provides that SPF 50 as advertised, this is my sunscreen for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended for people who need SPF but hate how regular sunscreens feel on the face.</li>
    <li> I use this on a daily basis and I dont really know if it really works. The product looks like it has little dots in it, like it doesnt have a consistency color and consistency which makes me thing it might be expired (but I dont know how long sunscreen usually lasts)</li>
    <li> This product has very high alcohol content. That was the first thing that gave me the urge to return the product. Alcohol is known to be used to break the skin&#x27;s barrier which is perhaps the reason why this product is absorbed into the skin so quickly. Unfortunately, due to terrible customer service I got no response when I requested a return. Leaving me stuck with the product (hence do your research people and be sure when you make the purchase). After weeks of hesitation I used the product and...it wasn&#x27;t so bad. I only apply it on the body so I have no idea what it will do for the face. Some benefits are that it has a light gel texture that absorbs quickly and dries matte. Also, it has a citric smell which is more pleasant than the usual chemical fumes of many other sunscreens. It has prevented sunburns however I am not quite sure about tanning. I have had no adverse reactions to the alcohol content however I still remain wary and will not be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen EVER!!!!  Don&#x27;t ever stop making it!!!</li>
    <li> I have oily skin ad this is perfect for it. I used to used neutrogena and it always left my skin super oily. I am a bit disappointed the price went up so much from January. I bought it at the end of January for about $6 and free shipping (with nothing else), in February they took away free shipping, and now it&#x27;s $12 that&#x27;s crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m sure this is all basic supply and demand haha, it is great sunscreen.</li>
    <li> ive never had a sunscreen that i loved and that wasnt greasy.in fact, i avoided wearing any at all until i tried this. goes on light and smooth,</li>
    <li> Great sun block. Does not leave white residue. Makes application easy and simple, light on the skin and make up goes on it easy too.</li>
    <li> This has to be a new favorite! -on like water (not greasy at all) with a delicate scent and makes foundation application so much smoother. I will use this year-round!</li>
    <li> I am a very picky sunscreen user because I have extremely oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin. So I was on the hunt for a high SPF and PA +++ sunscreen. This one is awesome! It comes in a tube, with easy application and a short lasting matte effect! Which is such a bonus! But I kind of found it weird that it looks like speckles in the sunscreen and it didn&#x27;t go away after I tried shaking it. However, doesn&#x27;t bother me at all because it goes away after you rub it in. There isn&#x27;t a suncreen smell either!</li>
    <li> No cast at all.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturize a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Very light.</li>
    <li> A very very good sunblock that didn&#x27;t greasy and work, all kind of skins can use it, I have sensitive combination skin, when I use it, it will not have any problems, and it hydrate my skin too after I put it after 3 mins, it is really amazing product. You no need to use special cleanser to clean your skin, just normal simple cleanser , it can remove it. It is really great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen after receiving a recommendation from r/skincareaddiction on Reddit and I&#x27;ve been extremely happy with it.  Unlike the sunscreen available in the US Biore is non oily and absorbs into the skin very quickly.  It also does not have the normal sunscreen smell you might expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as my daily sunscreen and regularly wear it every day.  To me it really feels like more of a moisturizer than a sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I can&#x27;t recommend this enough for someone looking for an every day sunscreen.</li>
    <li> For those who don&#x27;t know the FDA is keeping the quality of US based sunscreens down. The PA+++ (they actually go up to PA++++ now) refers to the amount of protection the sunscreen offers from the UVA rays.These are the rays that cause long term skin damage and age the skin, so you want to have the best possible protection. This sunscreen is light, leaves no white film/cast, and has no scent. I use this in the morning before I begin my day and reapply later on if I was sweating during sports, or spent a large amount of time in the sun. It is recommended to wait 15 minutes after application of the sunscreen before going outside, and reapplying every 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem you may have with this sunscreen is that it contains alcohol. The alcohol may dry your skin or cause redness, so be aware of how your skin may react. Mine did have dryness at first, but my moisturizer took care of that. Asian beauty supplies are far above most US and even EU products. I recommend purchasing the newest version of this product, PA ++++.</li>
    <li> Non greasy and very light, will buy again.</li>
    <li> amazing product! Didn&#x27;t leave any white residue on my face! and it works! my face is not as dark as it usually is when I use other sunscreens.</li>
    <li> Amazing amazing amazing!  This sunscreen hasn&#x27;t broke me out at all.  The best part is that there is no white cast, creates a smooth finish, and also provides a nice base for makeup!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I&#x27;m highly prone to sunburns, and my face is extremely sensitive and easily irritated by most sunscreen. I never get burned when I use this product, and it feels amazing on my skin! I love that I don&#x27;t have streaks of white or oily shine on my cheeks after application. I&#x27;m planning on trying out some of the other sunscreens Biore makes, but I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Goes on great - it almost feels like rubbing water on your skin.  Very light.  Protected well.  Minimal scent.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> wow, i think I finally found the right sunscreen! It made my face feel so refreshed and hydrated after I applied on my face, a must have for summer! and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, oily or heavy on your face at all.</li>
    <li> I did not like it initially. After discovering how Korean air-cushion works, I thought this would be alright to put on top of makeup because it is so light.  Since then, I have been using it that way and very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Better than any American or European sunscreen in the market. Good formula, doesnt have that sunscreen smell, no white-cast, and absorbs quickly. Awesome!</li>
    <li> I love the spf and the feel of this sunscreen. I have forever been searching for a sunscreen that I can wear under my makeup without my face dripping oil by the end of the day. After putting on this product, after 5 min, it will dry and you wont feel a thing! It works perfectly for me. At the end of the day I still look okayish haha:P Remember that this isn&#x27;t  waterproof (water based heh) so if you&#x27;re doing something like swimming switch sunscreens!</li>
    <li> awesome clean feeling sunscreen! it goes on like a watery paste! bottle is a decent amount. good price for the quality. much more product than the sheisedo brand but a lot cheaper.  theres a reason why its numba 1 in japan</li>
    <li> The product feels great on my skin, and although it appears to be working (I haven&#x27;t experienced any sunburns, yet really only time will tell), I believe it might be causing some minor acne on my sensitive skin, but I do not know for sure, yet. As far as application goes, I use moisturizer first, this sunscreen second, and then a light powder foundation. Also, putting it on is very pleasant, and the product does NOT contribute to my oily skin issue.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this, but it gave me the worst case of perioral dermatitis.  It was so bad that by the time I got to work, my boss asked me what was wrong with my face.  It wasn&#x27;t expensive, so I didn&#x27;t feel as bad throwing it away.</li>
    <li> As a sunscreen that&#x27;s labeled as essence, this sort of chemical sunscreen is more for those who do not spend their days at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acne-prone individuals should avoid the sunscreen due to the alcohol content and other ingredients listed. My skin would appear blotched with red, and I would break out. Make sure to patch test, and review the ingredient list.</li>
    <li> Ten (10) days in the Caribbean sun - no wrinkles, dry skin or burns - just a beautiful even tan. Even on my face!&lt;br /&gt;The only sunscreen for me.</li>
    <li> It applies effortlessly, as the formulation is a bit more watery than other sunscreens. There isn&#x27;t that sunscreen-y smell, reminiscent of Banana Boat, which I appreciate so much. It dries without leaving a white cast on the skin. Very good.</li>
    <li> While this sunscreen dries matte and has no white cast, I found it too drying for me, likely because of the alcohol content. It&#x27;s a LOT better than the western sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried, but I think there are better out there.</li>
    <li> OMG this is seriously hands down the BEST sunblock I ever purchased and used. It&#x27;s really soft and smells nice. You can&#x27;t feel the sunblock on your skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave oily feeling on your skin. It&#x27;s very light!</li>
    <li> Not happy that this arrived with no expiration date. You need to know how old sunscreen is. Otherwise its a great product.</li>
    <li> Apparently they sent one to me, but I didn&#x27;t receive it. However, they had the courtesy to try to ship me another one and I did end up getting it even though it was quite late. I LOVE this product! It goes on my skin wonderfully. It has a small tint of of lemon if you smell it. I&#x27;m definitely buying this again.</li>
    <li> Goes on matte, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, no white cast</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It definitely blocks out the sun, protects my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. Finally sun protection without the acne!</li>
    <li> Even though I have dry and sensetive skin, and this product may not be the best for me, but it is indeed a good sunscreen which leaves the lightest feeling on the skin. And this product was shipped by the seller very fast!</li>
    <li> dry fast , non greasy , non whitening fx&lt;br /&gt;contain some alcohol but thats fine with me just apply some extra moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;ship fast and reliable. also good price</li>
    <li> So happy I found this! If you hate sunscreen but know you should be using it anyway, please give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on me, but I almost never use sunscreen unless I am going to the pool or known I will be outside all day in the summer. I just hate the smell, feel, and ghoulish white cast of normal sunscreens! This stuff is totally different. It is water-based and comes out as a smooth, light liquid instead of a thick white cream. Super easy to spread, and you don&#x27;t have to use a ton to cover your entire face and upper neck. It has a light citrus smell which I also enjoy. I can see how the alcohol in it may be drying for those with really dry skin, but for me it is perfect and sits just fine under makeup without feeling like a thick layer of cream on my face. Plus the price is awesome! I am so glad I found this and will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite winter sunscreen as it give a little bit more moisture then the other types. Sinks in well and doesn&#x27;t run down my face. Makes a good base for my powder make-up. If you are new to using sunscreen everyday, I suggest this as it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a lemony smell that quickly goes away. I hate scents around my face and I can easily tolerate this.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen! It&#x27;s so easily absorbed, and it has a pleasant smell which i enjoy. Some sunscreens are so thick and hard to apply, this one is a godsend compared to the last sunscreen I was using.</li>
    <li> Am I the only one who breaks out from this stuff?</li>
    <li> This is a great facial suncreen. Very lightweight and easy to wear under make up. It&#x27;s actually so light that it makes me wonder if there&#x27;s even SPF in it... but I haven&#x27;t gotten burnt so I guess it works. It goes on really wet, but after about 5 minutes it soaks in and make up can easily be applied over. Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores either. Not sure what ingredients are actually in it since everything on the package is in Japanese... but I like this product and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product which is different from all other sunscreens. It is very light , not greasy at all for the skin protection from the UV. I love it and will purchase it again after I finish it</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this sunscreen. It was very light and a little citrusy type smell to it. You could hardly tell that you&#x27;d applied sunblock! The seller as well was fab and really nice. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Great coverage, seems to last, will buy again (and have).  Definitely worth the price and the wait.  Hope it continues to work</li>
    <li> takes a long time to get this. but quality is good</li>
    <li> This is the second time I purchase from this vendor. The product is so amazing, absolutely the best sun screen I have every used. I have recommended this product to all my friends. It is really light weight, NON GREASY at all. It is water based, so you can wear it even without any moisturizer. Another nice thing about this vendor is very fast delivery. The estimated time was 4 weeks, but I received my product in 2 weeks after I made purchase. So I definitely come back again.</li>
    <li> This is amazing and melts into your skin, I love this sunscreen!</li>
    <li> Feels so hydrating and not chalky at all!!! Too bad it&#x27;s not for UVA and UVB but I have BB from Laneige that will help with that when I put it over the sunscreen. Doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast at all!!</li>
    <li> I have dry sensitive skin. I didn&#x27;t know that this product has alcohol in it. It works great, no white cast, feels wonderful. But after a few days, my skin got oily to compensate for the the drying effect of the alcohol. I could easily use this occasionally...probably even a few times per week and be fine. But I was looking for an everyday sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product would be great for someone with oily skin and who will not be affected by the alcohol.</li>
    <li> I love this product, so light. Since I&#x27;ve been changed to this one. I never have acne.</li>
    <li> Where has this been all of my life?! My skin is ridiculously oily, Florida summer weather does not help at all! All sunscreens, even those that are meant to control oil and are oil-free would feel greasy to the touch and on my face. This sunscreen is so light weight, has a light clean scent, and doesn&#x27;t make me oily. I think I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found my new holy grail sunscreen! I love that it has great protection, and it has a primer effect that is great for when I wear makeup.</li>
    <li> Sold on this product for life. It leaves no residue, absorbs super quick and wears super light but works like I&#x27;m wearing tons. It smells really good. Doesn&#x27;t make my face feel oily, dry, or flaky like different sunscreens. This is such an awesome buy. Affordable for the quality too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this sunscreen for about 3 months now (but not continuously). It works wonders. It feels very light on my face and is not oily at all. A little dab can go a long way as well.&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, dry on the bottom of my face and oily at the forehead. I have no irritations while or after using it. It is just a godsend and feels amazing compared to other facial sunscreens I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;My routine usually consists of moisturizer, sunscreen, primer, concealer, then foundation. So far my make-up looks flawless in this order with perfect protection.</li>
    <li> Biore sunblocks because they are not greasy and just melt in your skin like water. If you apply makeup this sunblock is just perfect for a mate finish.</li>
    <li> Love love love this bottle. I been using this for couple of yrs. can&#x27;t find anything better than this.</li>
    <li> My favorite sunscreen.  This absorbs into the skin beautifully, like a thin, water-based lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t have the slightest trace of oiliness that I associate with typical american sunscreens.  It&#x27;s great. :)</li>
    <li> I dont usually write reviews but I wanted to on this product.  It is so light , absorbs so quickly and feels so nice!  I have tried many sunscreens and never found one that felt good and wasn&#x27;t yucky on my skin,  This is a real find.  Highly recommend .</li>
    <li> the sunscreen is the best that i have ever used.  Hightly recommend it ! It is worth the cost! Excellent!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Non greasy. Matte finish. Absorbs into the skin. Doesn&#x27;t break me out ( I have combination skin)&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely repurchase&lt;br /&gt;The seller even sent a little note and a little snack from his son &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> This sunscreen applies so wonderfully. When you apply it, it&#x27;s as if you don&#x27;t have any sunscreen on. I have no problems using this sunscreen daily.</li>
    <li> I really like the feel oh this product its light weight so you don&#x27;t even feel like you put it on , it also dries very quickly and a little goes a long way, it has given me no breakouts, the only things I have to complain about is the bottle is small for the price and it has alcohol content.</li>
    <li> Contains too much alcohol which dried my face and didn&#x27;t offer protection at all. It does go on easy and isn&#x27;t thick and didn&#x27;t break make me break out like other protectors do.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen; it is SPF 50, is lightweight, and is definitely reasonably priced. I did not experience any break out from using this product either which is definitely a plus in my book. I had bought in prior to vacationing in Vegas and it definitely held up to its expectations as I wasn&#x27;t burned from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using about a pea size amount to cover entire face as a little goes a long way! I would purchase this again and I would recommend it for others to give it a try.</li>
    <li> I got this sunscreen on a whim. Normally, I buy Elta MD UV Clear SPF 46, but the price tag always killed my wallet. Being about 1/3 of the price of the UV Clear, I didn&#x27;t have high expectations, but I really love this stuff! It&#x27;s a great everyday sunscreen. It&#x27;s not greasy at all going on, which is my issue with some other Asian sunscreens. It also doesn&#x27;t pill over my moisturizer. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wearing it if you&#x27;re planning on being outside for the whole day, but seeing as I work in an office setting, it&#x27;s perfect for me. It goes on very light, almost like the consistency of UV Clear, but it&#x27;s yellow and kind of citrus-y smelling. Refreshing. It leaves a natural, semi-matte finish. Highly, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It is a great product from an excellent seller! I highly recommend it to everyone that needs sun coverage with a natural look.</li>
    <li> I hate wearing sunscreen, but this sunscreen made me love it!&lt;br /&gt;It can be kind of drying to your skin (it has a lot of alcohol, sadly), but when I apply it underneath moisturizer, it&#x27;s fine!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen at all, does not leave a white cast, and it is not greasy at all. I never want to buy another brand. Plus it has UVA and UVB protection and is 50+ Pa+++. I could not ask for more.</li>
    <li> For many years, I was not interested in skincare. And then quite recently, I just got into it. Moisturizers, creams, serums, cleansers, exfoliators, etc. My skin has never looked better. Because I&#x27;m on a skincare kick, I also needed an everyday facial sunscreen. I headed to all the makeup review sites and this was a favorite and I understand why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have the usual sunscreen smell which is quite nice. It&#x27;s very light on the face and it doesn&#x27;t break me out. I usually put on a mositurizer before and it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing too much on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about 6 months and just last month I took it out for the ultimate test: a beach day. I put this on my face and another on my body. I reapplied once during my 4 hours out on the sand. My skin on my arms and legs got burnt. My face was perfect. This is a wonderful sunscreen!</li>
    <li> This is very lightweight on the skin unlike most greasy/heavy formulas. It doesn&#x27;t even have the same sunblock odor or leave a white residue. I use it on my face under my makeup regularly.</li>
    <li> I love it. somebody brought me a bottle of this sunblock to try, and I absolutely love it. It doesn´t feel oily and it does prootects your skin. the only drawback, the amount, but even the size is practical to take in any bag</li>
    <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t like oily/sticky products. The Biore Sarasara Sunscreen is fabulous...a must if you are looking for lightweight texture with a fresh scent</li>
    <li> This is an amazingly light lotion, with great UVA/UVB coverage. I loved the scent; it felt great on my skin, even my face. Unfortunately, though, I&#x27;m sensitive to octinoxate (a chemical sunscreen), which is another name for the Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate ingredient, and I experienced a rash over my chest and face after applying. Really disappointing, because the texture and look of it are awesome.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen. Matte, feels amazing going on and when dry. No white cast. I have pretty sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t have any problems/reactions with this product. Go to choice for daily facial sunscreen!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, since I started getting into skin care I&#x27;ve wanted better protection for my face but American companies only make oil based sunscreen that balls up underneath my make up or has heavy white cast. This stuff is amazing, it makes my face feel soft and wears perfectly underneath my makeup.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is amazing. It feels very light, smells clean (not like the typical beach sunblock smell), does not leave any white residue, and does not feel greasy at all. I use this on my face, neck and chest so as not to waste it, as it&#x27;s a small bottle. And with Prime membership, shipping is fast! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> best sunscreen i&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> I really love how this does not feel like your average drug store face sunblock. The texture is a light cream and easy to spread. It hasn&#x27;t broken me out. The only thing I wish is that they market this in the US as well.</li>
    <li> Great and light on skin but broke out in my face due to sensitive skin.  I do still use it for my body, it absorbs fast and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this stuff. After breaking out horribly from using a sunscreen for faces, I decided that I needed something better. So glad customers on Amazon post helpful reviews. I&#x27;ve only used this for about a week, but I love the way that it makes my skin feel so smooth. The consistency is not goopy at all.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviwes, but I love reading then if I want buy a product online. I got this sunscreen because my doctor told me that I have oily skin and that I need it to be carfull  with sunscream because they make your skin more oily. He told me to look for sunscream water base.I look it up on Amazon and for the price I desired to get the Biore. It was super worted my money and it&#x27;s super light and don&#x27;t smells like sunscream with I love and it feels to me like outing water on may face it&#x27;s so light that after a 30 sec to a min you don&#x27;t feel that you have nothing on your face. After I started using this I have people come to me and tell me &amp;#34;your skin looks great. What are you using?&amp;#34; I hope this help.</li>
    <li> its greatest suns cream i ever use! will buy it again!</li>
    <li> To my surprise, this product blew me away with its light texture on application, moisturizing quality, non-ashy or no gray cast result on skin.  I&#x27;ve used regular drug store products to Kiehl&#x27;s, Clarins, Dior sunscreens but they were either somewhat greasy or left slight white sunscreen white cast after application.  This particular Biore product was super light, smelled good (dissipates soon after application), no trace of grease, very moisturizing (but not oily), and absorbed quickly.  Very little is needed as it glides on the face almost as if it&#x27;s coating the surface.  One weird thing that did happen was that it reacted to my Laura Mercier&#x27;s Oil-Free Tinted Moisturizer by causing both products to rubb/peel off my face almost like eraser debris.  However, I tried this with my Revlon &amp; Guerlain foundations and nothing abnormal happened.  I&#x27;d certainly repurchase in the future.  Best sunscreen ever so far!</li>
    <li> Works really well on my normal/combo skin. It has a slight alcohol smell that goes away pretty quickly, and gets absorbed right away.</li>
    <li> Leave a matte finish on skin. Not oily like other products. I&#x27;m very satisfied. I will probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love the watery feel of this sunscreen. Very light and probably the most comfortable sunscreen l have ever used. No smells and brightens fare without making it look pasty or shiny</li>
    <li> Great, light sunscreen. Protected me during extended sun exposure in Florida this summer. Has a nice citrusy smell and disappears into your skin.</li>
    <li> This product is super light on oily skin and it&#x27;s definitely does the job. My skin is very greasy and I always have a hard time finding the right sunblock for my skin. Money well spent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. It does not have any type of scent, it&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
    <li> I heard great things on the skincare subreddit that I had to try it out. It did take a little while before it arrived but the wait was well worth it! The product is a little bit watery but it absorbs super nicely into the skin. There is no stickiness with it. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I liked this sunscreen. I have really oily skin, and by the end of the day, my skin didn&#x27;t feel heavy. Some people mention the alcohol, but it didn&#x27;t really bother me. Felt almost like astringent. I liked the scent as well. Smells nice and clean. I didn&#x27;t mind the price either, because I would pay a few more dollars if I know the product works well.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to protect as well as I thought.. I use Mederma with spf 30 on arms, etc.. it seems to block better than this did for me...</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is the best that ever existed. You only need a little and it feels great! It works just as described. I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> Really love this sunscreen. This stuff is amazing. Texture is like water, goes on smooth, and feels hydrating.</li>
    <li> Very light and easy to use. No white face due to sunscreen. Viva Japan!!  I recommend this!!</li>
    <li> Nice light smell; not greasy feeling at all.</li>
    <li> This is a HG product for sunscreens.  At first, it did make my skin very dry.  But after a week, my skin got used to it and it does make your skin look very glowy.  It has a gel-like consistency, so it is very cooling when applied to the skin.  The scent is also very soothing, kind of like a flowery/citrus smell.</li>
    <li> Arrived 2 weeks early which was greatly appreciated as I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to arrive prior to leaving for my vacation (took 16 days from order date to arrive). No white caste. Slight citrus smell, maybe lemon, but certainly not an unpleasant odor that most sun screens come with. Have not actually applied it to my face but it appears it is exactly what I wanted. All of the packaging information is in Japanese. Great purchase for only $9. Not oily or thick.</li>
    <li> The award for the first ever moisturizer with SPF to not leave my face shiny and greasy goes to this product. I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed and happy with this.</li>
    <li> I like the other one purchased from Biore. I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I believe it will work well.</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply.  Good for oil skin.</li>
    <li> Non greasy and does not make your face turn white.  However, when you reapply too much it dried my skin out.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is light-weight and works very well. It is non-greasy and rubs in to a matte finish. I have oily skin and can wear this under my make-up with no problem. I used to use Neutrogena dry face, but it burned my eyes. I thought I would just have to live with it because it was the only sunscreen that didn&#x27;t make my face an oil slick. I&#x27;m so glad I found this sunscreen. I will never go back to my old stuff!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.  Despite its relatively high SPF, it is not greasy at all.  It&#x27;s lightly scented and feels pleasant.  The cream is very smooth and easy to apply and my face doesn&#x27;t really shine which is what happens with many sunscreen products.</li>
    <li> the ONLY sunscreen, chemical or physical, that doesn&#x27;t give me hives. also has a pleasant citrus scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;feels like a light moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;broke out on my forehead after using daily for two weeks, but i can&#x27;t say that this is the direct cause of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not perfect, but the best sunscreen i&#x27;ve found so far for my sensitive, sunscreen-averse skin.</li>
    <li> This is THE best sunscreen I have ever tried. I&#x27;ve been looking for something that felt weightless and non-greasy, and this is the first that does exactly that. When I first tried it, I couldn&#x27;t even believe it was sunscreen, as I&#x27;d grown up using the kind that made my face felt like I&#x27;d rolled around in a bed of french fries!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently bought one of the top sunscreens on Amazon (Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Liquid Sunscreen), and it pales in comparison to this one. It felt light but this is WEIGHTLESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and stock up on these!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s water base, and it&#x27;s great to feel nothing after putting on my face,</li>
    <li> This is super light... When you apply it it feels like water in your face and then just disappears into your skin. I really loved how it feels. I gave it 4 stars because it made me break out and shiny, but I am very acne prone. So I prefer the perfect face milk instead. It still deserves 4 stars though because it&#x27;s really an elegant sunblock. I plan on getting a bottle for my friend. My husband, who has normal to oily skin, now uses my bottle and it doesn&#x27;t break him out. He loves the watery consistency.</li>
    <li> It cleans the face nicely.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a few days but so far I absolutely love it! It goes on clear and the texture is not thick or sticky. It also looks great under makeup which is what I was worried about originally. Definitely my new favorite sunscreen and I will be ordering more in the future!!</li>
    <li> My very sensitive skin has aging spots but this sunscreen make them faded.  I did not see any redness on the skin after been exposed several hours. The medium size cream pearl penetrates pores very fast and does not change your skin to oily or dry. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is honestly amazing. I have oily, acne-prone skin and had been using Elta MD&#x27;s quality but quite expensive line of facial sunscreens, which cost between $23-30 for the same 1.7 oz amount you get here for $13.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of ease-of-use, performance, and cost, this sunscreen is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. In all of those categories I find that it easily is superior to Elta&#x27;s offerings. The only category in which their products have an edge is possibly in ingredients. I don&#x27;t have a problem with what&#x27;s in this - and the proof is in the pudding, it works flawlessly - but if you&#x27;re the type of person who is very particular about ingredients and formulations, you may find Elta MD&#x27;s stuff to be a better fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff, though, goes on effortlessly. It turns to near-water consistency as soon as you start to spread it, and it immediately absorbs into your skin. The skin afterwards feels incredibly smooth - I can see why people say this makes an excellent base for makeup, though I don&#x27;t wear any. And it passes the most important test of all: it doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
    <li> love it!love this product! very easy to apply. sicked of American sunscreen, too oil too sticky. this one is very light and clear</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I didn&#x27;t even know that I can use this as a make up base. No wonder whenever I look in the mirror, my skin looks smooth. Others as well notice; It doesn&#x27;t make me break out and it absorbs easily. I wear this product day and night, especially in the face, and when I wake up in the morning, my skin is smooth and fresh. I would definitely buy this product again. I just hope they have a gigantic size of it. That would be awesome. &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it, it dosen&#x27;t feel oily at all and when you apply them you just feel like you are putting on watery lost ion. It is very moisturizing and it has SPF 50+++. It protect my skin well. This is also free shipping but it takes a bit longger to ship it from Japan to the U.S</li>
    <li> It is very light and quick absorbed that I literally find myself to reapply it every two to three hours just like every sunscreen recommends. The texture is almost gel like and very minimal fragrance. I only wish they would have a bigger size.  From the amount I am using, I probably need to repurchase it every two to three weeks.</li>
    <li> too small not nough and didn&#x27;t really work</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this sunscreen.  I am always trying to find a good sunscreen.  I have very sensitive skin.  In fact, vitiligo makes it very hard for me to be in the sun for an extended amount of time.  I had high hopes for this sunscreen but I ended up with a sunburn.  So...the hunt continues...</li>
    <li> Feels divine. I am mot sure about how well it protects against uv but as someone with dry skin... I love the way this feels. Definitely not greasy and has a citrus scent. Reminds me of the warm moist towels at the spa with a little bit of lemon in the water.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable when put my face. Very smooth and easy to apply. Shipping does take a while.</li>
    <li> The best ever! Quality, price and benefits. I highly recommend this product for who has oily skin. The saler also is very good: excelent package and fast shipment considering that sent it from Japan and I live in USA.</li>
    <li> Even though I&#x27;m not sure if this sunscreen actually works to protect you from the sun... I am giving this 4 stars! That&#x27;s crazy you say but I think it works (I&#x27;m not positive as I did get burned one day) and it goes on nicely, causing no breakouts or irritation. There is a smell but it is pleasant. It does take some time to be delivered and I am using it quickly so the price is a little high. I like it enough to buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product - not oily or sticky!  Highly recommended.  Only downside is that the product information is in Japanese.</li>
    <li> It did not protect my face skin from the sun very well. Lightweight, like a gel, but this not for me because I have hyperpigmentation problem and I need high powerful protection. If you have an oily skin and no issues with melasma or rosacea you may like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about this sunblock, and i&#x27;m thrilled that this ships Prime.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very lightweight sunblock that is easy to apply and absorbs right away into your skin. If you can imagine Water in gel form- that&#x27;s really what it feels like!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont believe this has any moisturizing ingredients, so you still have to use moisturizer before putting this on. That might be a turn off for people who like a no-hassle all-in-one sunscreens and just need to get out the door faster in the morning. In that case, I would recommend a BB cream with SPF.&lt;br /&gt;However, i always put on 2-3 things BEFORE sunblock in the morning (Toner, day serum, moisturizer), and i hate that with other (creamier) sunblocks i put on top of all that, my face just feels heavy. My favorite thing about this sunblock is that there is never any residue left on your face, and it literally absorbs completely within 5 second of spreading it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, remember to spread this quickly all over your face, otherwise it will absorb in only certain portions, and you would have to apply more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you cant tell already, i&#x27;m kind of a skincare snob, and i&#x27;ve tried a LOT of sunscreen products. This by far is my favorite. The price is also super reasonable- I&#x27;ve paid more than twice the $ before in products that weren&#x27;t half as good.</li>
    <li> Evidently the Japanses know how to properly sunscreen a face and this is how they do it, Buy some.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every day for about 6 months and I love it.  It absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy, and best of all, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out!</li>
    <li> I had heard praises for this sunscreen online for ages! Now that I&#x27;m halfway through the tube, I can say that although it&#x27;s very effective at blocking the sun and pretty decent under makeup, I probably won&#x27;t repurchase. My face and alcohol don&#x27;t get along, and applying this is like dousing my face in a martini. It smells very alcoholic and has that tell-tail &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; effect that alcohol has (plus alcohol is listed right there at the top of the ingredients list). Alcohol is drying and causes faster aging, and unfortunately it is the first or second ingredient in a lot of beauty products. Besides this, it is really a great sunscreen. It doesn&#x27;t wear off and creates a nice makeup base. It&#x27;s non-shiney and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts for me at least. But I do feel that it&#x27;s somewhat drying especially around my eyes, which is why I&#x27;ll keep looking for the perfect sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I wish Biore&#x27; would sell it in the states but until such time comes I will continue to purchase here. I am of Celtic descent and have fair, freckled skin. My daughter turned me on to this item as her skin is fairer than mine. The product does not leave a greasy or oily feel nor does it leave that heavy clogged &#x27;mask&#x27; type feeling.Rather it is silky smooth, does not require alot, soaks right in and does not burn or run into eyes. Most importantly it works very well. Skin feels soft and smooth and just nice all while being protected from the sun &#x27;s UVB (causes sunburn) AND UVA (causes long term skin damage) rays! A must have if you have fair, sensitive or already damaged skin.</li>
    <li> Date Purchased/Length of Ownership: 5/25/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;| Pros |&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;- No Residue: it feels like you have nothing on; definitely light enough for everyday wear&lt;br /&gt;- No White Cast&lt;br /&gt;- Not Greasy AT ALL: In fact, this sunscreen actually helps control oiliness.  Unlike most sunscreens where if you spread it on w/oily skin, the sunscreen just ends up making it worse, THIS sunscreen actually reduces the amount of oil already on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t get oily as the day wears on&lt;br /&gt;- Spreads &amp; absorbs easily&lt;br /&gt;- SPF 50&lt;br /&gt;- Lasts a long time: I apply this sunscreen on my face/neck 1x/day and the first tube has lasted me 2-3 months.  My skin is medium-olive toned and I don&#x27;t burn, so if you&#x27;re lighter-skinned than it&#x27;d be reasonable to expect a tube of this to last about a month (w/heavier application).&lt;br /&gt;- Smaller tube than your average 8 oz drugstore sunscreen means that you&#x27;ll definitely use it all up before it expires&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to remove: I use homemade (olive oil) cold cream or Noxema &amp; it comes right off&lt;br /&gt;- Very mild cooling sensation when applying&lt;br /&gt;- Fresh, faint citrus-like smell (not overpowering, but noticeable if you have a sensitive nose)&lt;br /&gt;- Price: $5.75-5.85/oz is as good a price as you&#x27;ll find for a sunscreen of this type.  Many compare it to Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46 which retails for twice the price (~$25) for the same amount (1.7 oz)&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;| Cons |&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;- Chemical sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;- Not waterproof (it&#x27;s water-based) and thus will wear off if you go swimming with it&lt;br /&gt;- More expensive than your average (greasier, oil-based) run-of-the-mill drugstore sunscreens&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;Notes/Tips&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;- If you&#x27;re willing to wait 2-3 weeks to receive it, the ordering from a Japanese seller is usually the cheapest route ($9-10 vs Amazon&#x27;s $12+)&lt;br /&gt;- Just bought my 2nd tube at the end of September</li>
    <li> I have spf in my foundation, but I wanted stronger protection. I was scared this stuff was going to be thick and make my face gross, but I have loved it ever since I got it. It  goes on wonderfully on the face without making my face feel clogged. I have very acne prone skin and this stuff hasn&#x27;t broken me out yet. Love it! Protect your skin with this stuff and you&#x27;ll be thankful later in life!</li>
    <li> Amazing, very smooth and perfect for a daily basis use. No oil. I am conviced to buy the next time</li>
    <li> I found out about this product on U Tube.  It is a very nice sunscreen, it is light weight, not chalky, and very much like a light lotion.  I can&#x27;t believe that it has sunscreen.  I plan to purchase it again.  I have purchased other sunscreens that were so thick and extra white.  THis is perfect and I plan to use this item over again.  It does take a while to receive but it is worth the wait.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this regularly and loves it.</li>
    <li> This  sunscreen is amazing!! It doesn&#x27;t sting my ultra sensitive eyes, and there&#x27;s no nasty sunscren smell either! It smells a bit citrusy but the scent doesn&#x27;t  linger very long. The consistency is very watery so it sinks into  the skin in literally seconds! After it sinks in, you can&#x27;t  even feel it on your skin at all. My super duper oily and acne proned skin loves it so so much. It doesn&#x27;t break me out. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Thank you so much ! It is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used :)</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen that I use during summer! It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky even after you sweat.</li>
    <li> I have super oily skin but this stuff actually mattifies it so well that I don&#x27;t just use it, I look forward to using it. Makes a great primer for makeup, too. Great price compared to other sunscreens of similar quality, and does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> the strongest protection, the lightest feeling and have a  cheap price,</li>
    <li> This stuff is rather amazing. It feels like a liquid lotion that absorbs instantly with a delicate citrus fragrance. The only complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a bigger bottle!!!</li>
    <li> My favoraite sunscreen for facial area is always Allie. But this Biore Aqua is a very good body sunscreen with a reasonable price. I like Japanese suncreen cause they will not make you feel oily or greasy like most suncreen products her in the States.I believe it works for dry and combination skin. Not sure for very dry or oiy skin.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried at any price! This feels hydrating and leaves no icky &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; feeling on your face. It&#x27;s cheap AND it&#x27;s SPF 50! This is a chemical sunscreen. If I want extra protection, I&#x27;ll layer this with another favorite, the Clarins face sunscreen (SPF 40), a physical sunscreen. I&#x27;ll buy this until they don&#x27;t make it anymore. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The mailing took almost one month~~~~The product itself is good though.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I ordered this product from the same seller. The product is excellent and the seller delivered the product from Japan is fast. It is not greasy on your skin. It fees fresh. My high school kids love this product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Always perfect! Fast delivery and fair price! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Really good sunscreen. Does not break me out at all. Disappear into the skin really quick. The only downside is that it makes my skin kinda oily.</li>
    <li> this stuff has easily made it to my everyday morning routine. the bottle is pretty small but not much product is needed, esp if you mix it before hand with a moisturizer to guarantee you don&#x27;t miss a spot. I also do that because it lessens me having to drag my skin. it smells very light works very well for my combination skin.</li>
    <li> being Black, finding sunscreens with high spf THAT DOESNT leave a white cast can be rather difficult... but I have no problem with this! it doesnt leave a white cast on my skin at all... just dont let it get in your eyes cause it can burn like hell.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I have very sensitive oily skin and I used to not wear sunblock coz I found that they would cause me to break out, feel oily , and look cake. I&#x27;ve tried very expensive brands but this product works really well and is very inexpensive . Worth it.</li>
    <li> This is GREAT for oily skin.  Not sold in the U.S.  Hard to find.  So glad I found it here</li>
    <li> Not greasy nor sticky. I like the product so far cuz it don&#x27;t smell like &amp;#34;suncream&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after wanting a high spf on my skin, but not wanting a white, greasy look on my face. It does it&#x27;s job, but I found a better product that works much better.</li>
    <li> I really like the fact that it does not leave a greasy feeling nor does it melt off my face when exposed to the hot sun. Best sunscreen ever!</li>
    <li> Nice and light, and has a nice scent. Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried. Not greasy at all, but also not really moisturizing so I have to use it with a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and I have extremely sensitive skin. I used this product over a suggestion of a young Japanese beauty Guru who has amazing skin. I really wanted to like this but after 1st application I realized that it is not meant for people with sensitive skin. I had to return it.</li>
    <li> It is light and hydrated. Have a high SPF. Maybe not good for preventing from blazing sun but very good for daily use!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the way this product feels, it applies very smoothly and isn&#x27;t sticky or shiny when it dries.  It does have a light citrusy aroma, but it seems to dissipate quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very surprised with the speed of shipping, it only took two weeks from order to arrival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably order this product again.</li>
    <li> Light and absorbs so easy into the skin. No burning sun screen scent or feel. Has a refreshing citrus fragrance that leaves you feeling fresh. I will definitely buy this product again. Product came I excellent condition and on time that was expected. Definitely will buy again from this seller!!!</li>
    <li> great product. but long shipping time from Japan.</li>
    <li> probably the best one available around</li>
    <li> I looked through many reviews before trying this sunscreen and I&#x27;m glad I did. This is so much better than American sunscreens. It is pretty watery but still easy to apply and does not leave a white cast of my face. It feels soft, not greasy, and it does not break me out or make my eyes burn. It has a light citrus-like scent that does not stay all day. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Feel light and no unpleasant smell</li>
    <li> HG sunscreen! My absolute favorite. I&#x27;ve used Sunplay Super Block, Elta MD UV Clear, Elta MD UV Shield, Alba Botanicals Very Emolient Suncreen, Neutrogena Dry Touch...so many sunscreens and nothing compares. It dries evenly and nicely, and although it has alcohol in it, it does not irritate my sensitive skin. The seller also shipped it with a cute thank you note, super sweet!</li>
    <li> awesome 2nd time buying</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> After using it for 3 days, my face had a allergic reaction, red and itchy.  I do not recommend it.</li>
    <li> This face sunblock is absolutely amazing, it lasts very long, it dries on without feeling oily its thin but has great sun protection and smells really good as well</li>
    <li> This was the most satisfying product . The lemony smell of the bottle was very refreshing and nice moisturizing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, when I opened it , it was completely sealed, so I noticed it was brandnew.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, it sinks in immediately so it&#x27;s perfect for layering under makeup, hasn&#x27;t caused my makeup to pill.</li>
    <li> Absorbs very quickly- apparently you&#x27;re supposed to use over moisturizer and under makeup?</li>
    <li> Extremely GOOD!!! NO OIL on my face after applying it for a whole day.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens before finding this one recommended heavily on reddit. It goes on smoothly and gets absorbed quickly. I blend this with a tinted sunscreen I have and my make-up is just about done. I wish the bottles were bigger, but I&#x27;ll just have to stock up on more.</li>
    <li> Pretty sure this does not stay on.  I have been burned twice while using it and my other lotions do not allow burn.  I tend to sweat more than most and am in greenhouse environments so may work for casual user.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. just feels like putting on essence. even more watery-er than the kiehl&#x27;s fluid sunscreen &amp; NO OIL.</li>
    <li> Free oil!!! Love it sooooooo much. I have bought it three times and I won&#x27;t change to any other brand</li>
    <li> it never gives me greasy feels. Its an amaging product. I have this in my bag all the time then when I needed I can apply at anytime in anywhere. it dries on skin super fast and never feel like you are wearing a sunscreen at all. it wont stain my bags and grease on my jewerly. gives my skin a perfect moisture. it also smells like grapefruit I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> The best facial sun screen. It feels like a creamy water toner. Goes on clear bad gets absorbed instantly. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for swimming as the sun screen is water based so it roll easily wash off. This is more fir every day use under moisturizer and make-up.</li>
    <li> It feels so very nice and light, I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s sunscreen because it feels like there is nothing on. It also looks like there is nothing on, meaning no white cast and no shiny greasy look, which is awesome. It is also very moisturizing and I tend to have dry and sensitive skin. No breakouts also and I have been using it for about 3 months now. I will be buying more. I just wish it came in a much bigger size but so far it seems like a little goes a long way and that it will last a long time. You&#x27;re supposed to wear SPF everyday to avoid sunburn, skin cancer, and premature aging/sun damage and this product makes it much easier to protect your skin health.  For people that hate sunscreen because of the feel and/or smell, get this! Even though the shipping wait may feel like forever and the price may be a bit much for what you&#x27;re getting, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this sunscreen is not greasy but gets absorbed very easily. It does not leave a white or pasty look after application. I use it during summer and winter.</li>
    <li> I love it! I actually bought La Roche Posay a week or two before I started using this product. La Roche is the top western face sunscreen and Biore&#x27;s is the east (or at least the preferred brand of Asians living in the west).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem with La Roche and other Western sunscreens is that the Avobenzone would run into your eyes and burn like crazy. You&#x27;d ruin your makeup tearing up and rubbing so it was pretty obnoxious for everyday use. Western sunscreens are also oil-based which makes your face needlessly greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biore on the other hand is made for everyday use when you&#x27;re working in an office or staying at home. Since it&#x27;s water-based, it is easily absorbed and dries quickly like an oil-free lotion not to mention IT DOESN&#x27;T STING! That also means I can make sure I get as close as possible to my eyes and get my under eyes and the sides (where crow&#x27;s feet forms) buttered up with sunscreen. It also has a pleasant lemony scent so it doesn&#x27;t smell like you&#x27;re at the beach. However, since it is water soluble, it&#x27;s pretty useless if you&#x27;re swimming or doing other sports so I would keep the La Roche around for outdoorsy activities.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin.  Very dry, so I overproduce oil to compensate.  This makes putting on makeup in the humid South a nightmare.  On the one hand, I need the moisture because my skin is dry.  On the other hand, the humidity turns my face greasy and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I walk to class and need to protect my fair skin from the sun, but the SPF15 in my foundation usually isn&#x27;t enough.  I regularly burn with SPF30.  I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t turn to my Japanese roots sooner.  (You&#x27;d think I&#x27;d have looked sooner into products that girls with similar type skin use.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s look at this amazing sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- very, very light (almost watery)&lt;br /&gt;- you need very little to cover your face (large, pea size drop)&lt;br /&gt;- goes on like a liquid gel, easy to spread&lt;br /&gt;- no fragrance&lt;br /&gt;- dries PERFECTLY MATTE (I cannot emphasize this enough)&lt;br /&gt;- absolutely no oil (you can test it with a blotting sheet if you want)&lt;br /&gt;- causes no acne&lt;br /&gt;- no allergic reaction&lt;br /&gt;- works well under foundation makeup (I use Neutrogena&#x27;s rice complex)&lt;br /&gt;- most importantly, keeps me from burning until sundown&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- not exactly waterproof&lt;br /&gt;- sorta sweat proof (might crease your foundation)&lt;br /&gt;- expensive for sunscreen (use on your face, not your body)&lt;br /&gt;- not available anywhere except online&lt;br /&gt;- small bottle&lt;br /&gt;- did dry out my skin the first few times when I used it alone (put a thin, watered down layer of face cream first or use a cotton lotion mask, then use the sunscreen)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At last!  A sunscreen I can use daily under my foundation!  I feel so much better knowing that I&#x27;m protecting my face from harmful UV and sun rays.  I know my skin will thank me as I age.  I anticipate this bottle will last a long time, so the cost is worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super picky about sunscreens. I wear sunscreen 365 days a year, rain or shine. I don&#x27;t like sticky, shiny, white cast, thick, sunscreens that feel heavy on my face. This one is none of those. It&#x27;s mostly a chemical sunscreen which is why it doesn&#x27;t cast white on skin or have a shiny appearance. My last Shiseido suncreen was pilling under my makeup, this one doesn&#x27;t. Please remember to use 1/4 to 1/2 of a teaspoon when applying to face to get the full protection offered. If you&#x27;re not sure how much that is, measure the amount in water and pour in the palm of your hand. It&#x27;s a lot. The bottle is much bigger than most facial sunscreens too, I think it might last me two months instead of one month. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and will be buying it again. Japanese sunscreens are truly supreme to American versions.</li>
    <li> Like others, I ordered with a little hesitance, considering the estimated long ship time. It only takes around 10 days to arrive with little note and gift, very sweet. This sunscreen is very light just like water on the skin, feel very comfortable. I read the amazon questions and answers for this product, didn&#x27;t see any potential harm integrates inside. Just started use it today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I come back and order the products again, and noticed now it&#x27;s qualified for Amazon prime member 2 day shipping, great~</li>
    <li> There is too much alcohol in the ingredient.After i tried that couple times ,I&#x27;m thinking about who are the best owner for this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of facial sunscreens and have found most cause me to break out, appear excessively oily, or both, so I was pleasantly surprised that this sunscreen did neither! It&#x27;s highly recommended on SkincareAddicts, and after using it for about a month I see why. It goes on silky, more like makeup than sunscreen, and soaks in right away. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> It is great! I live in central California, a very dry place with too much sunshine. But I have had problem to find sunscream which is not greasy. Now I did. This product is not greasy or dry. I wear it a whole day long and feel wonderful. My makeup stays on nicely. I ordered two more since the tub is so small, not like American product. I am anxious to wait for them. After all, it is lovely.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very light on skin</li>
    <li> Bestest best sunscreen in the world. No white smear left behind, no grease or other residue, just perfect (and matte) skin. I love the scent too!</li>
    <li> This is extremely clean feeling for something that have as high as a spf50, i&#x27;ve used other japanese brand of spf50 sunscreen, none of them felt as fresh as this, however this is on the pricier end of the spectrum which is why i went looking for alternatives. However i only use spf30 on a daily bases, the spf50 is only reserved for going outdoors and vacation times, this is 50gram which is a little less than 2oz, however i have used a lot of high end sunscreen that&#x27;s way more expensive and contains less product, but i think we all know they are over-priced and doesn&#x27;t worth the money, so if you are someone with sensitive skin and is looking for sunscreen product that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and break you out, this is it, however, i will only recommend using this if you are planning on been outdoor for extended period of time, not because this isn&#x27;t good, its just unnecessary.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen, it has a nice citrus scent and makes your skin feel so soft. It doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast on your skin and it didn&#x27;t cause me to breakout like some other sunscreens have. I&#x27;d definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think most people will have a problem with this type of product but IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO ALCOHOL IN YOUR FACE SKIN PRODUCT, pass this product. Only after a few days, my face got pretty itchy. I didn&#x27;t understand why but this was the problem: the alcohol! Otherwise, enjoy your product but not for me.</li>
    <li> Non sticky, very light. I wear it everyday and I believe it protects my skins very well</li>
    <li> The only sunscreen that doesnt make me breakout or burn my skin. Believe me i&#x27;ve tried everybrand. I&#x27;ve been using this for the last four years. I&#x27;m 27 yrs old and people think i look like i&#x27;m 20. All thanks to this wonderful product. I use it everyday and if i dont put it on i get panicky lol. Love love love this sunscreen!</li>
    <li> very light and high quality.. came with a green kit kat.. lol</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is not greasy at all. I have really sensitive and oily skin, so I have to be really careful on choosing sunscreens. Most of sunscreens in drug stores leaves a greasy feel on skin after applying. And this one is not like that at all. It feels as if I haven&#x27;t applied anything. It&#x27;s also really long lasting. I&#x27;ve been under the sun for at least 4 hours, didn&#x27;t get any sunburns and didn&#x27;t tan that much either. Definitely a great sunscreen! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Very effective. Readily absorbed to skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave sticky feeling after application. The texture is very light, not too thick or heavy like other brands I have used.</li>
    <li> All was OK, good seller</li>
    <li> Holy grail sunblock!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, leaves your skin soft and smooth -- it even doubles as a makeup primer. It doesn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
    <li> 50+Sunscreen protection, I&#x27;m not sure, but it smells good and I used it everyday. Worth to try it in summer.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen deserves more than 5 stars. Goes on like a dream, absorbs quickly, smells great, and somehow manages to make makeup look even better. I actually look forward to putting this on everyday. So glad my search for a comfortable, every day sunscreen stumbled on this. They better keep making this stuff forever</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I have ever used. I am from the U.S. and every sunscreen here is so thick and leaves a white film..most smell bad. So I ordered this stuff and wow. The scent is pleasant, it is lightweight and sheer. For a sunscreen with high spf .. I am amazed. Also, it truly absorbs so it is perfect for under makeup. Love.</li>
    <li> Smooth and light!  Just like the texture of moisturizers, looove it!</li>
    <li> Just received it today and I was absolutely in love it now! Haven&#x27;t seen such a good sunscreen forever! It&#x27;s not oily, instead it feels like I am putting on a moisturizer! Definitely gonna buy it again!</li>
    <li> This Sunscreen is Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Very Light with high Spf and PA+++. easy to blend and absorb very fast, Not make your skin Oily.&lt;br /&gt;Price is reasonable when compare to other face sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;100% Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I wish I can read the ingredients. With sunscreen there are certain ingredients that a must, but with this product, the description on the bottle is entirely in Japanese. Otherwise, the product seems to absorb very well into the skin. I can barely tell and feel anything. Because this is waterbase sunscreen, I would imagine more frequent reapplying especially in the summer with sweating.</li>
    <li> Works very well. No stinging eyes and not thick and gloomy. Very good purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this. I break out easily, but this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts for me. Not greasy at all and has a nice, mild citrus scent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice sunscreen with a nice smell.  However my skin is sensitive to it, even if after I kiss my kids who has it on.</li>
    <li> The best sunscreen I have ever used.  No white cast, no greasiness, absorbs quickly and moisturizes just enough.  Highly recommend.  Probably would not wear sunscreen everyday if I had not discovered this.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this sunscreen!  I recently moved to Florida and I burn almost instantly.  I wanted a sunscreen that wouldn&#x27;t make my skin feel greasy.  Even the newer Neutrogena products that were recommended by others still made my skin feel greasy.  I have long hair as well, so I didn&#x27;t want a product that made my hair look and feel greasy on the ends.  This sunscreen was a lifesaver!  I am stocking up!  Its a shame its not available for purchase in the US.</li>
    <li> Love! Love! Love this sunblock! My sister introduced this sunblock to me 4 years ago and it is the best! I use it everyday under my makeup. It is extremely light, not greasy at all, and absorbs quickly into the skin. It doesn&#x27;t have the typical &amp;#34;sunblock&amp;#34; smell like the others. It has a very pleasant light citrus smell. My mom, aunts and friends are also now hooked on this sunblock. Try it! You will not regret!</li>
    <li> My favorite sunscreen. Feels so light and natural on my face and goes under makeup beautifully.</li>
    <li> white cast and makes me break out</li>
    <li> This is my HG sunscreen.It doesn&#x27;t break out my acne-prone skin, and it is the first sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried that IMMEDIATELY sinks right into my skin! I always hated applying sunscreen because of how long it took for it to go in, but this is not a problem with this sunscreen. It also leaves my combination skin feeling very soft and moisturized. Add to this the amount of sun protection it has, and I&#x27;m sold. The only possible con is I wish it had the max UVA protection, but it&#x27;s still good enough for me. I definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> smelled lemony and fresh and left my skin matte but moist and just a little bit lighter. The texture was like a dream for such high spf!</li>
    <li> I usually use American moisturizers that come with sunscreen in it, but it was really thick, and I thought that was fine. But after using this sunblock, I honestly really prefer a separate moisturizer and sunblock. The American sunscreen moisturizers were really thick for a daytime moisturizer and it had a distinct sunblock smell, that I didn&#x27;t mind at first. This sunblock is really easy to layer, and supposedly it has hyaluronic acid in it, which is also really good for your skin. Not only that, the SPF is 50 which is really great, compared to 30 on my old sunscreen. It has a really subtle pleasant smell and its thin. It also works as a base for makeup. I put on bb cream (also with sunscreen) on top of it, so it does a really awesome job at layering. I would definitely buy again, and I would feel really comfortable never buying new sunblock ever again. This does the job for me! It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> So light on the skin without feeling oily. Great coverage and a little goes a long way. Love it!</li>
    <li> This does not leave any white shiny cast over my face, like most sunscreens do, but rather goes on clearly and smoothly. It also has a citrus smell to it. I only wished it had more product.</li>
    <li> It is so weightless that I can&#x27;t feel it on my face. It has no discernible scent.</li>
    <li> It goes on really really nicely. Smooth, not greasy, no white cast. Unfortunately, it irritated my face a bit.</li>
    <li> as written on the product cover, it&#x27;s aqua rich. definitely not greasy. won&#x27;t make your skin look shiny and oily even hours after applying. one of the best sunblock product to apply before foundation and other makeup. shipped relatively faster then estimated. used 4 so far.</li>
    <li> Not oily at all, but enough moisturizing for my dry skin. Work well with foundation after it too.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend seller mild JAPAN, free and fast shipping, delicious snack~thank you~\(≧▽≦)/~</li>
    <li> My favorite sunscreen by far.  It comes out a little on the more liquid side unlike most sunscreens but not to the point that it is rolling off your fingers.  Application is great - no smell, applies quickly, does not sting my eyes if I apply in that region and quickly sinks in.  The best part is the high spf.</li>
    <li> It smelled so good, like citrus. Honestly, I would repurchase for the scent alone. But if you are sensitive to scents, even when they aren&#x27;t very intense, then I don&#x27;t recommend this. It also makes my skin feel soooooo silky smooth. I definitely will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I hate the smell of sunscreen. Being pregnant I hate it even more. This has a light nice citrus smell, so much better than American sunscreen. No white cast. Nice and clear. Easy to blend into your face under your makeup! You can&#x27;t the amount of SPF in this little baby! I use under my makeup and it&#x27;s light enough to not clog my pores, and washes off with my cleanser! A staple in my makeup bag! I should&#x27;ve bought backups lol I will be ordering again soon! Love this!</li>
    <li> Amazing. Gel texture, lightweight feeling and absorbs immediately. 10/10 would buy again.</li>
    <li> best sun cream i ve ever used&lt;br /&gt;it is my third one, and i still like it the most&lt;br /&gt;not creamy at all, and easy to absorb on face and body</li>
    <li> Oh lawd, the second ingredient is alcohol. This product irritated my skin and my face turned red. I trash it.</li>
    <li> Oh how I love Asian sunscreens!!! I will never go back to American ones. This one has been the best so far. It is semi gel/liquid and smooths onto the skin so easy. It doesn&#x27;t feel or smell like sunscreen and no white cast whatsoever. I have oily skin and this has not broken me out which is nice. I wish it was in a bigger bottle though.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have very sensitive skin and have no issues when I use this product. It goes on and does not sit on your face. You may look a bit shiny at first but then it sinks in and gives you a very natural look. You&#x27;ll forget you&#x27;re event wearing it. That is amazing for a SPF 50 that is PA++++. I have used both the PA+++ and PA++++ versions and there is hardly a difference, except for the added protection.</li>
    <li> This is the only suncreen Ive ever tried that didn&#x27;t break me out OR leave me shiny. It does sting if you get it too close to your eyes, so watch out! Thanks /r/skincareaddiction!</li>
    <li> Not greasy at all. Skin feel soft after using it.</li>
    <li> This product is very good! It is not oily at all, the protection is good, when I used it under strong sunshine more than 2 hours. I will buy it again for sure!</li>
    <li> I love this just because I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing ANY sunscreen at all. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s enough for protect you if you&#x27;re out in scorching sun all the time but it&#x27;s good for everyday wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive though and I haven&#x27;t bought it again after I lost mine just after a couple of uses :/</li>
    <li> The texture of this is lovely, but there is a distinct alcoholic smell to this, which is not surprising as alcohol is the second ingredient listed. Perhaps there is some benefit to there being that much perceivable alcohol content here, but i hesitate putting something that smells a little like vodka on my face. No, thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the vendor took a month to deliver. I ordered on April 13th; seeing it was not shipped, i pinged the vendor on may 1st. They essentially said &amp;#34;wait for the goods.&amp;#34; It didn&#x27;t get here until may 13. Maybe I&#x27;m less patient than the average, but waiting a month for a $10 sunblock, ESP one that i now won&#x27;t use, is too long.</li>
    <li> Not icky sticky. You can continue to put layers on throughout the day and it won&#x27;t feel heavy or cakey or sticky. Nice and lightweight</li>
    <li> Great product! Arrived in time!</li>
    <li> Wow, we North Americans have really been missing out with our sub par sunscreens that feel heavy, oil and tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is the complete opposite ... light, watery and absorbs nicely without stickiness or shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING STUFF. Gotta stock up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to try this stuff and compare. It kicks even the more expensive stuff (e.g. I was using ROC&#x27;s and Olay&#x27;s facial sunscreens)</li>
    <li> I had never had used sunscreen until I was told by the wise-ones,  that it is extremely important and a must for aging skin.  When looking for sunscreen in the market and the ones I found were sticky, chalky  and the SPF is not that high – Can across this product on Amazon on January 27 2013 and about to order my 5th bottle/tube.  If I could bath in this product I would. After applying my face serum, cream etc..  I usually wait for 3 minutes for my skin to absorb the serums etc and apply this amazing sun screen – it is super light and very hydrating.  In fact when I rushing out and don’t have time for my morning regiment this is the product I turn to, this is my On the Go Buddy. So far all the products that I have purchased on amazon this is my fav. - thus my 4th tube is about to finish-- Must order more...</li>
    <li> When I first got this sunscreen, it was so watery that I wondered if it was going to work. However, it seems to provide excellent protection even in sunny tropical climates. It absorbs quickly and is not greasy at all. The sunscreen does contain alcohol, which can be drying, so depending on your skin type you will need to use an additional moisturizer with it. It also has a floral fragrance, but it does not bother my sensitive skin at all. I am very acne prone and this sunscreen has not broken me out at all. Once it soaks in, it feels like you aren&#x27;t wearing sunscreen at all, making this the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. Makeup goes on normally over it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this sunscreen for over a month now and my oily, acne-prone skin loves it.&lt;br /&gt;It feels light, glides on skin nicely, it&#x27;s invisible under makeup and, best of all, doesn&#x27;t break me out. Sun protection is pretty good for people who don&#x27;t spend too much time under direct sunlight. Probably won&#x27;t be enough for those who work outdoors. It also contains a bit of alcohol, so probably not for dry sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this sucker is a strong contender for my HG sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I like the way it smells.  It feels good on my skin &amp; doesn&#x27;t break me out.  It&#x27;s also very moisturizing.  ^_____^  I wish it were cheaper, though.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Non greasy&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t make your skin white&lt;br /&gt;- Slightly smell but nice&lt;br /&gt;- High SPF&lt;br /&gt;- You can use for face and body&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive</li>
    <li> I have pretty oily skin naturally so I&#x27;m always concerned about finding a face sunscreen that want make my face look like an oil pit. This has been the best I&#x27;ve found at the end of the day my face is a little oily but that&#x27;s all natural, this is a great sunscreen</li>
    <li> I started to really focus on my skincare in the last year or so, and I realized I really needed to incorporate a sunscreen into my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m acne-prone and have dry skin. This chemical formulation does not irritate my skin and does not dry my skin out further. It glides on smoothly and sinks right into the skin.</li>
    <li> VEry quick shipment and didn&#x27;t expect to becoming from Japan. Very nice produc and I just got it so will come back to write my experience. it smells and feels good.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product that goes on so easily! It&#x27;s hands down the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve used and the texture is not greasy at all. It&#x27;s so light I was scared I got a bogus bottle. I&#x27;ll never use anything else again. I spend hot summer days on a boat or sitting on a floatie and this has never let me down.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff. I have extremely sensitive skin and everything irritates me but this product is great and made my skin feel great and look great! not only does it not smell like sunscreen or feel like sunscreen but it dries quickly with no residue feeling, has a fresh scent that doesn&#x27;t linger, applies thinly so you don&#x27;t actually need to use a lot of product, and is for both face and body (cause you know, my neck, chest, arms and hands need sun protection too when I&#x27;m driving). Too bad this doesn&#x27;t come in a large package, like a lotion bottle. I would put it all over my body like lotion to make sure all of me was protected from the sun.</li>
    <li> Excellent product arrived in perfect condition as shown within reasonable shipping time. Would purchase again from seller, thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try new Biore Japanese sunscreens every season, and this one is very good. I still prefer the Perfect Milk 50 for its strength (no tan, no burn in sub-tropical sun), but this Rich Waterly Essence is more moisturizing, and great for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I struggled for 20 years with American sunscreens that don&#x27;t work, cause severe irritation (horrible stinging and burning when applied to the face!), and are generally a waste of money; I had basically given up on using sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shout out to reviewers at MUA and other sites for letting more of us know there is a MUCH better alternative--just wish the FDA would wise up.</li>
    <li> Best affordable uv lotion. The consistency is quick-dry and not sticky.</li>
    <li> Finally, I got this in the mail. I used  it today and overall, it&#x27;s very good. Not thick or globby. No white  to be seen. Easy to spread, easily absorbed. DHC has a  very good sunscreen too. But if you compare  the prices, this wins.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen absorbs quickly and leaves no white streaks, if you blend it in. I believe this has titanium dioxide. There is no shine on my face at all. It doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate my face or eyes either. And it is fragrance free too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My skin is dry, acne prone, and I didn&#x27;t get any breakouts or pimples. Since my skin gets very dry in cold weather, I have to use a moisturizer before applying the  Biore Sarasara Uv Aqua Rich Waterly Essence Sunscreen Spf50. In warmer weather, it moisturizes my skin lightly. It feels like it is water based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with this sunscreen is that if you squeeze it to hard, too much will come out, and you can&#x27;t put it back in. You only need a small amount to use for your face. It spreads around very easily. I wish it didn&#x27;t run out so fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:(June 12, 2014) This does NOT have Titanium dioxide or Zinc oxide. I found out from another site that translated the ingredients.  You won&#x27;t get any irritation like the other typical sunscreens ingredients you find in moisturizers. I did not get sunburn, but did get freckles!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used up one and repurchase it. It&#x27;s totally OIL FREE!!</li>
    <li> Ingredients: Water, Alcohol, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Lauryl Methacrylate/Sodium Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate, Dimethicone, Acrylates/C10-30 Acrylate Crosspolymer, Glyceryl Stearate, Agar, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Citrus Grandis, Citrus Medica Limonum, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis, Xylitol, Butylene Glycol, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Hydroxide, Potassium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Disodium EDTA, BHT, Fragrance Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence Sunscreen SPF 50/ PA+++&lt;br /&gt;The 2 infredient is alcohol !!!!How can be best rating here?&lt;br /&gt;We have  Citrus Grandis, Citrus Medica Limonum, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis,those citrus ingredients is very bad for the skin....OMG</li>
    <li> Unlike other sunblock product, there is no mass on the face. It seems to blend well on the skin.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is absolutely perfect. I had been looking for a lightweight, non-greasy formula to wear under makeup -- something that would be actively working, but also not disrupt my foundation. This is perfect for people with oily skin, as it provides all of the SPF without the grease! It has a satin smooth finish which acts as the perfect base. Very pleased with the seller -- I got this item so quickly, considering it came from Japan! And they had written me an adorable little note with a tiny snack -- so cute! Will definitely order again in the future, highly recommend. :)</li>
    <li> Probably the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried to date. My skin is very sensitive, and I&#x27;ve spent a long time searching for a sunblock that won&#x27;t make my face break out. Not only does this keep my skin clear, but it&#x27;s also fast absorbing, non-greasy, and doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast. I will continue using this daily.</li>
    <li> I hate creams on my skin. Sunscreens, in general are so heavy. But this one, it is so easy on the skin, unbelievable. I wish I had known about this earlier.</li>
    <li> Love this! I just finished my first one and I have to order another! it&#x27;s makes my skin so soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all, I have very sensitive skin</li>
    <li> My friend recommended me this product for summer. And after I tried it, I feel it contains water and I don&#x27;t need to worry about sunshine</li>
    <li> I have only been using this sunscreen for about 10 days, and my first impressions are really good ! It&#x27;s extremely  thin, when you compare it to other sunscreen that are supposedly thin , this one just beats them incredibly! It did not break me out, which is also very reassuring as at the moment I am struggling with some bad skin damage possibly from over exfoliation , and my skin has been very flared up, red, dry for the last 2 months almost. Whilst I am struggling to find a solution for that and minimized my skincare to very few products and no make-up , I still want to put on a sunscreen, and Bioree has proved to be a good one. I think it does dry a little but if my skin was at its normal state I think it wouldn&#x27;t be even noticeable. I tried Bioderma photoderm fluid version but it was still very greasy, and would not sink in for ages.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Non-Greasy. Perfect for Summer.</li>
    <li> I wanted a sunscreen because I knew my skin would be sensitive to the sun from the other products I use to clear my skin. I came across this product based upon other skin products I viewed. I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it. It is very light and absorbs well into my skin and doesn&#x27;t look or feel like I have a thick white film on my face.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen! I&#x27;ve used neutrogena&#x27;s sunscreen which is supposed to feel light-- but really it doesn&#x27;t even compare to this one. This one feels so light and it makes my skin feel incredibly smooth. The one thing I have noticed about this is that it gives my face (mostly my forehead) a bit of a shine, but it isn&#x27;t too bad. I just use some powder and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Finally found my perfect sunscreen!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sold! I put this on after my shower in the morning and it&#x27;s fabulous. I&#x27;ll be buying this from now on!  Update: I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and I haven&#x27;t been burnt yet. It&#x27;s still wonderful!</li>
    <li> A beautiful product. Very silky to use.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make me break out, great coverage and no white cast</li>
    <li> It is very good especially for Asian skin. Love it.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I like the watery cream and not sticky to my face. And also you can put on your face after make up too. But you have to know how to do it so your make up not remove.</li>
    <li> Very light weight, great under make up, No silvery white film or clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;The best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Great product and quality from Japan. No oily feeling.</li>
    <li> very nice. it&#x27;s not super heavy like most sunscreens and I do recommend it to someone not interested in a waterproof sunscreen.  Its has a very light consistency.</li>
    <li> Very lightweight daily sunscreen.  Even by the end of the day, you never get that sticky sunscreen feel.  It also has almost no smell.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the tube lasted longer.  It seems like I&#x27;m already halfway through the bottle after only 2 weeks.  I might be using more than I need, because of the light texture of the product, but I&#x27;d rather have more than less when it comes to sunscreen.  Also, since it&#x27;s not waterproof, I wouldn&#x27;t use this on days when I&#x27;m active or hot.  Otherwise, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s very light, comfortable and smooth. The seller is very nice too. Will continue to be your customer. Thank you!</li>
    <li> fantastic! smooth, clean, and rubs in easily. However, it is a bit pricey for the size of the bottle but if you only use it on your face the bottle should last awhile.</li>
    <li> I like this product. Smells nice and light. Texture is watery and absorbs well. Doesn&#x27;t sting eyes either!</li>
    <li> Great product, feel like lotion not sun cream</li>
    <li> This is a great everyday sunscreen! I have oily skin which deterred me from using the traditional american sunscreen. However this product is nothing like the american versions. It is not oily, does not have a strong lingering sunscreen scent, and has high protection! It is pretty light and absorbs very quickly into your skin. What&#x27;s better is it does not leave a white cast! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have been on the hunt for the perfect sunscreen and I think I found the one! This sunscreen has a gel like consistency. It is very light and spreads very easily. It does not create a white cast nor does it ball up when rubbed on the skin (as most sunscreens do). This absorbs very quickly and does not leave a greasy feel. It has a pleasant citrus scent, but I can see a person sensitive to scents being put off by this, I don&#x27;t mind the scent.The only down side to this product is the price for the size.</li>
    <li> I really like this product!  Very light, not oily at all! Trust me, I recommend this product to all oily skin type!</li>
    <li> This is a great sunscreen. It has no scent and its very watery, which is great. It slides on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily sheen like other sunscreen. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This is one the  best cream💯 I love 👍</li>
    <li> Love this!!!!! Really good for summer! Never sticky! The seller are sooooo nice!</li>
    <li> It feels very light which I like it...I wish it had better ingredients though,,</li>
    <li> This Japanese product is a lot different compared to the sun lotions I typically find here in the US. Once I received the product I tried it immediately to see what it was like. The formula is very liquid-y. It spread all over my face quite well and my skin drank it up rather quickly. As I went about my day I tried to see if it would break me out. I put make-up over it and found that it was just fine. I did not get any break-outs from it and found that it was quite hydrating. Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The reason for my giving it four stars is because of the amount of time it took for the product to reach me. Since I purchased this on Amazon from a Japanese company based in Japan, I can understand why it took so long. Honestly, I guess I was just impatient.</li>
    <li> No greasy residue and feels like nothing is on the skin once it is absorb. Love it for those hot humid days. The only con is that it is not waterproof, but I still like a lot.</li>
    <li> I struggled for years with U.S. sunscreen.  Between clogging pores leading to acne and rolling into my eyes along with sweat from my forehead due to not being fully absorbed-- it&#x27;s been quite a daily frustration.  A lot of sunscreens, even high end department store brands, give my skin a burning sensation when first applied straight after cleansing with my Clarisonic.  This sunscreen not only absorbs quickly, but it goes on smoothly so my foundation looks smooth on top as well.  I wish it was more accessible locally, but ordering it online isn&#x27;t the worst thing in the world.  I just wish they had a &#x27;supersized&#x27; bottle at a discount because, if you are using the correct amount, this stuff goes fast!</li>
    <li> Stays on light and non greasy.</li>
    <li> i like this stuff. i am runner; in the sun every single day. my face usually breaks out with all sunscreen products except Zinc Oxide. This is light, goes on clear, and seems to keep me from getting sunburned during my runs at the beach.  I have very dry skin if that helps with roscea too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i did buy it again.</li>
    <li> Have used about 3/4th&#x27;s of a bottle and it works great as a commuter sunscreen. I have not used it during a sun heavy time like going to the beach so I can&#x27;t comment on that. Leaves no white cast and is very lightweight unlike most American sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried. These kinds of sunscreens are a bit harder to get off and when I first started using It I had a huge breakout, and realized it was because my normal face wash wasn&#x27;t getting it all off. An oil based cleanser solved that problem mostly. Although cleaning properly stopped the huge breakout I still get a few small blackheads from this sunscreen so I figure I&#x27;m sensitive to something in it. Going to switch after this bottle.</li>
    <li> The one sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make me look like I had been tipped in titanium dioxide. Thank u</li>
    <li> I love this alot!! Its amazing!!! It absorbs really fast and theres no white marks to keep spreading until gone, but nope not with this lol you put it on and its gone fast :)  Arigatuo, and Kooun wo inorimasu!! :))</li>
    <li> love love love it! don&#x27;t ever want to buy American sunscreen anymore!!!</li>
    <li> Product arrived in perfect condition. I love this sunscreen product because it doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;sunscreen\\&quot; thickness, whitish sheen or funky smell!!! Absorbs nicely on my skin.</li>
    <li> A nice light sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Smells like fresh fruits but not so strong, goes very smoothly and feels watery on my face. After few hours apply my face does not look oily at all. fair price, nice seller and  fast Shipping.</li>
    <li> best sunscreen i used doesnt leave white-cast on face so i dont have to worry about not rubbing it all in. its not greasy  and spread easily it smells lemony  going to rebuy rebuy rebuy</li>
    <li> Awful. Very watery and I actually got very sunburned! I&#x27;m not convinced this was 50SPF as stated on the bottle. I used my sisters expensive 50SPF instead and was fine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very very smooth ,not like other sunscreen lotion that very sticky.</li>
    <li> Love it so far. I have very sensitive skin and easily break out, but this product has been great for my skin. Love the price. It did, however, take a long time to ship.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I hate how greasy I feel after I apply sunscreen and moisturizer. This is the only sunscreen I have ever found that leaves my face feeling clean. It kept me freckle free after a day in the sun.</li>
    <li> I like it. It doesn&#x27;t give that white camouflage face like other sun screens. Nice smell, very light. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen!  I have tried a few of the Japanese sunscreens and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t dry me out terribly.  I do like the Biore and Shiseido ones, but I cannot wear them daily without becoming dry as the desert.  I can wear this over my regular moisturizer without that happening.  This is good protection without being harsh.  Highly recommended.  I have had no breakouts and it wears nicely under my makeup.  I will continue to purchase.  FYI, I have combination, acne prone, sensitive skin and this works well for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen for your face and neck.  My whole family use it.  We live in southern California where the sun is strong all year around. It was always a struggle to put sunscreen on my kids in the morning before school.  However, my kids don&#x27;t mind putting this one on by themselves before going to school every morning because it is none greasy and none chalky.  It does not leave the white marks on their face like other sunscreen would.  For me, I use it everyday under moisturizer.  It is truly light weight, goes on smoothly with a cool sensation.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The absolute best sunscreen for oily skin, ever!</li>
    <li> Love it, it is my second time to chose this product!</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it.  I use it every day under my make up.  Has no residue, no oily feeling, just clean coverage.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Wow! This sunscreen is amazing. It absorbs nearly instantly and does not leave any kind of film on my face, nor does it leave any kind of whitish cast.  It has a pleasant slight citrus fragrance when applying it.  It&#x27;s great for my oily skin, and has become my favorite face sunscreen. I only wish they made a water-resistant version of it, but for daily use it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s very light weight and doesn&#x27;t clog up my pores. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Dries quickly! Doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s a nice size for traveling around with too.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen ever used!</li>
    <li> I love how it&#x27;s not greasy on the skin like the other sunscreens!</li>
    <li> Bombest sunscreen everrrrrrrr. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of ss and this is the best</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the rave reviews and a little bit of research; and I have not been disappointed. I have pretty sensitive skin and certain products causes me to have small breakouts. I also do a lot of sports and certain products tend to clog my pores.  This is 100x better than any sport sunscreen like Coppertone but lightweight enough for daily use. This is such a light cream that it does wonders to protect my face from the sun! It has no real apparent smell or odor that lingers and goes on very smooth. Not even close to being considered to be a thick type of face sunblock and it does not leave the hands feeling sticking afterwards at all.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a daily use sunscreen that has good protection, doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling sticky or oily, and won&#x27;t ball up if I apply foundation over it. This sunscreen fit the bill. It&#x27;s a very watery sunscreen that feels like a light lotion. I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast and you can&#x27;t feel it on you after it dries. It absorbs easily so it dries clear. The smell is slightly citrusy/lemony, which is a very refreshing change from the metallic smell of most sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried. Highly recommended and will buy again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light and has none of that sunscreen smell. And it doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Will definitely repurchase</li>
    <li> Makes my skin very oily</li>
    <li> Love this sun screen actually bought it in the fall &amp; use every day, a little go&#x27;s a long way. Plus it doesn’t travel into your eyes when you sweat and it doesn’t burn your eyes like other creams do. Not greasy either. Absorbs instantly into the skin.</li>
    <li> my summer official sunscreen.</li>
    <li> One of the best sunscreens I have used. It doesn&#x27;t have the filmy paste that you typically get with most sunscreens. It&#x27;s water based so it applies like a liquidity moisturizer. Nice product. It was also packaged really nicely from Japanwalk. Fast delivery !</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!! It dries to a smooth finish and does not smell nor feel like American sunscreens! It works wonderfully under my makeup and does not take 5+ minutes to dry which I love since I always seem to be in such a hurry. Will be repurchasing!!</li>
    <li> this is the sunscreen that won&#x27;t irrate your eys, no wired scent and no greasy or any bad feeling left on your skin</li>
    <li> so it&#x27;s fine for beach volleyball, but is horrible when you forget and bring it HIKING or CAMPING with you.  a complete nightmare.  i used my other sunblock for the first three days of camping and had no bites, the fourth day, i used biore sunblock AND ATTRACTED ALL THE MOSQUITOES in the campground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fast forward 8 months later, i bring this sunblock camping AGAIN.  FORGETTING THAT IT&#x27;S A MAJOR BUG ATTRACTANT and am harassed by bugs ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t ever use if you&#x27;re going &amp;#34;outdoors&amp;#34; hiking or camping.  it really sucks for this.</li>
    <li> Really LLLLLOVE this one, it&#x27;s not heavy and my skin feels really moist after use it.</li>
    <li> It absorbs nicely, leaving no white cast what so ever. The scent smells like citrus which im glad it does, cause i cant stand  the sunscreen smell.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant about buying the product from amazon as the estimate delivery date was almost a month later (That was before the amazon prime option was available for this product). However, the actual shipping time was only around 10 days, which was fast, considering it was shipped from Japan. The seller (mild_japan) also included a thank-you note and a small gift, which I really appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen is one of the best I&#x27;ve used. It has a high SPF, yet is very light weighted and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin a sticky, oily feeling. It&#x27;s perfect for everyday use, and you can&#x27;t really beat the price for such a high quality product.</li>
    <li> this really is my favourite sunscreen, i only use it on my face as the bottle should come in bigger size!!  i use my less favourite sunscreen on my neck and hands.  best for daily use &amp;#60;3</li>
