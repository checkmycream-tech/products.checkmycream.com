      <li>It has so many uses.  </li>

      <li>When using their method it works even better</li>
      <li>Thorough and safe.</li>
      <li>RECOMMEND to everyone :)</li>
      <li>a pleasure it is to finally be able to shave in the shower.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more compact size.</li>
      <li>The most efficient way to shave.</li>
      <li>Buy it, use it, love it.</li>
      <li>Would love it if they figured out how to make one</li>
      <li>And for the moment, I&#x27;m not looking for something better.</li>
      <li>REALLY long nylon cord hanger isn&#x27;t the best for stability either.  </li>
      <li>One more thing...because it hangs, you can easily hold it while you shave...</li>
      <li>It will fit better in a carry on or suitcase.</li>
      <li>it means it&#x27;s easy for me to rinse any time I need to.</li>
      <li>made, the rope is easily adjustable.  </li>
      <li>I can easily recommend this item.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smaller size means you have to hold it in your hand for the right angle to get the best shave or move yourself around the mirror.</li>
      <li>As a mirror, it works fine.</li>
      <li>I tried their trick for keeping it fog free and it works.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t break and will be fog free if you follow the directions</li>
      <li>no fogging, doesn&#x27;t get in the way and is easy to clean.</li>
      <li>I follow directions and heat both sides in the shower water and it stays fog free.  </li>
      <li>The reason this mirror works is because of the rope and its light weight.</li>
      <li>Spots and streaks seem to accumulate easily on it, making it a bit of a chore to clean up before you use it every time.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised at how light it was, which was nice...</li>
      <li>then water gets on the mirror making it not impossible, but not that comfortable to see the reflection.  </li>
      <li>Cool mirror.</li>
      <li>Does fog up, but holding it under warm water helps keep it clear.</li>
      <li>I really wasn&#x27;t sure how to get this coating off and eventually had to risk damaging a corner of the mirrored surface to find an edge that I could start peeling it off.  </li>
      <li>The rope was an unusual but great idea especially since we have textured tile in our shower and suction cups don&#x27;t stick.</li>
      <li>stays fog free pretty well and holding</li>
      <li>I also really like that it packs easily and allows me to have a mirror in the shower when I&#x27;m on travel too,</li>
      <li>Very lite and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews (and nowadays, with the low quality of most of what we buy, most of them would be negative if I did), but I had to take a moment and highlight this truly excellent mirror.</li>
      <li>Great little shower mirror.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a mirror on a rope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame that when you search &amp;#34;shower mirror&amp;#34; you just get glue and suction mirrors, where people report varying levels of success at getting them to stick permanently.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it, but I thought that was worth mentioning, since the product details seem to leave that</li>
      <li>I wish it was actually more of the rose gold that is pictured rather than the plain mirror color that it is, but it serves its purpose well.</li>
      <li>The price was right, too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just the right way to make it happen.</li>
      <li>The cord can be useful as well if you&#x27;re creative and want to hang in various places and styles.</li>
      <li>You can clean it up with soapy water easily, but it&#x27;s an extra step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The mirror is light and very clear.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it said to.</li>
      <li>First, the lack of a star is basically because of the price.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;rope&amp;#34; part is of a much higher quality than I was expecting.</li>
      <li>The items was exactly what I had been looking for.</li>
      <li>The product works but you have to put it under water first</li>
      <li>First of all, forget the &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>whatever that stuff is that naturally builds up on smooth shower surfaces.</li>
      <li>So I have used so many different mirrors to shave with in the shower and</li>
      <li>But turns out you just have to make sure the hot water hits the back and it will not fog.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I really like this mirror!  </li>
      <li>This was on stone tile, so its pretty sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The mirror is plastic, but reflects clearly and true.</li>
      <li>It does have a little metal hook to hang the cord from at home; I suppose the cord would be handy when you don&#x27;t have the hook for travel.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t hold it much.</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>I really like that it has a rope to hang it from the shower head.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice size and shape! Easily adjustable! Great find!!</li>
    <li> Great shower mirror. I hang it in my shower and use it to shave and it works great. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I like it, having it on a rope makes it easy to put under the shower for a few seconds which keeps it from fogging for a few minutes.  Would love it if they figured out how to make one simply not fog though!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well made, the rope is easily adjustable.  The hook that comes with it is functional.  I don&#x27;t recommend putting it over the shower nozzle itself, makes it tough to see what your shaving through the streaming water.  I dropped it once, no damage at all.  This was on stone tile, so its pretty sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using rain-x on it so the water beads off it quicker, but probably not necessary.</li>
    <li> Not really sure how those negative reviews got here.  I have been using my mirror for a few months now.  The only time it fogs is when I breath on it.  I follow directions and heat both sides in the shower water and it stays fog free.  The size is just right not too small, not to big.  I can easily recommend this item.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it does. Happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several &amp;#34;fog-free&amp;#34; shower mirrors over the years and get that the laws of physics do not support that idea. I like that this mirror has a nice, heavy duty cord and does not have a plastic frame. The price was right, too.</li>
    <li> I like it, but wish it was a little larger.</li>
    <li> So sorry to burst your bubble. It does not have a rope. I would call it more of a mirror on a thick string. I digress. I shave in the shower because it gives me shower power. Shaving in the shower is the equivalent of eating peanuts like an elephant. It&#x27;s just the right way to make it happen. So I have used so many different mirrors to shave with in the shower and the same thing always happens... FOG. I hate fog. So I bought this mirror because it promised to change my life and I lost my last mirror. Here is the big news you have been waiting for. It works. If you need to see clearly in the shower while you shave then this is a winner. Is it perfect? No. Because it is $10 and there is no perfect mirror shower solution. They all get water on them and they all fog if you don&#x27;t place them under the water. This sucker works like it is 1999. Don&#x27;t spend hours searching for a mirror on amazon that promises to things that it just can&#x27;t promise. Like my grandma used to say. Goodbye.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a mirror on a rope! It&#x27;s about as basic as it gets but since it can&#x27;t actually shave for me that&#x27;s all it needs to be! In all seriousness though it doesn&#x27;t fog up and is very clear which is the problem with other mirrors I&#x27;ve had. Good product and cheap!</li>
    <li> First of all, forget the &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; thing. No mirror is fogless; it&#x27;s a fundamental quality of smooth surfaces that they will mist up when wet and in varying temperatures. The reason this mirror works is because of the rope and its light weight. The mirror is plastic, but reflects clearly and true. Hanging it on the included hook means that you can take t down and hold it under the water to equalize the temperature somewhat. This makes it less foggy, although water beads on it quickly. I use my shower squeegee to wipe it down every so often. The included &amp;#34;rope&amp;#34; is actually about 5 feet of nylon paracord, so it holds up well and shouldn&#x27;t rot. It also has a plastic slide should you wish to cinch it up. A metal hook with a glue-tab back is included to hang the mirror on when you&#x27;re not holding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works as well as or better than any other shower mirror I&#x27;ve used. Again, it is NOT fogless, because fogless is an impossibility absent some high-tech coating or something. As a mirror, it works fine. Its best quality is that it&#x27;s very light and easy to hold or hang around your neck. I like the fact that I can just hold it under my chin to see to shave my neck, and I don&#x27;t have to crane my neck as I would with a wall-mount. Frankly I think the price is a tad high for what you get (I&#x27;d sooner have paid 10 bucks for metal or glass), but for what it is, it works well and I like it.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror! It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve ever had that doesn&#x27;t give me fogging problems in the shower. The secret is that, unlike most, the back of it is not enclosed in anything. If you can&#x27;t get to the back of the mirror, you can&#x27;t equalize the temperature between the front and back (by holding it under the warm water), so the result is fog. It&#x27;s simple science. So yes, it fogs up...and you rinse it, front AND back, and the fog is gone. This is the least expensive mirror I&#x27;ve ever had, and it&#x27;s the best! I normally don&#x27;t write reviews (and nowadays, with the low quality of most of what we buy, most of them would be negative if I did), but I had to take a moment and highlight this truly excellent mirror. Just follow the simple directions (rinse off the front AND the back when you&#x27;re ready to use it) and you will be satisfied. One more thing...because it hangs, you can easily hold it while you shave...that&#x27;s a bonus if you wear glasses, as you don&#x27;t have to stand right next to the shower wall to be close enough to the mirror to see well.</li>
    <li> nice in the bathroom. wish they have slightly a bigger size.</li>
    <li> This is not &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I works as stated, but I wish it was water repellent.  It does stay fog-less for some time.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Perfect for my shaving needs in  the shower.</li>
    <li> The product seems to work well.  &amp;#34;Fogless&amp;#34; is an over-statement and the physics say that no such product exists unless the mirror is actually heated to the temperature of your shower steam.  But, since this is not metal backed, it works better than other mirrors and I have no issue just wiping the fog off with my hand and then shaving.  This size works nicely for shaving in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one gripe is about the packaging.  It comes with a plastic covering on the mirrored surface and that covering is very difficult to find an edge and to peel off.  I really wasn&#x27;t sure how to get this coating off and eventually had to risk damaging a corner of the mirrored surface to find an edge that I could start peeling it off.  I did eventually get it peeled off, but it should not be this hard to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rope is a nice touch since I can hang it on the shower head without having to sticky or suction cup it to the wall (both of which seem like temporary solutions destined to fail), but the rope is not risky at all and works well.  Since we have hard water, I&#x27;ve determined that I really have to dry off the mirrored surface after each shower so it won&#x27;t accumulate hardened water spots (which is what happened to the prior mirror I was using).</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it said to. I really like that it has a rope to hang it from the shower head. As long as you pour some hot water on the back while in the shower for a few seconds, it stays fog free.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done, no frills, works as described. Does fog up, but holding it under warm water helps keep it clear. The rope is a little on the long side.</li>
    <li> Compact; does what it says</li>
    <li> I really like this mirror!  Initially, I was concerned because it began to fog.  But turns out you just have to make sure the hot water hits the back and it will not fog.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This thing looks good quality but its huge! Maybe the company can make a travel size.</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND LOVES IT. THE ROPE IS PERFECT BECAUSE SUCTIONS WON&#x27;T STICK TO OUR WALLS, THIS IS THE PERFECT ALTERNATIVE!</li>
    <li> Well-protected shipment and did a nice job and a quality build. The mfr even heat-sealed the ends of the cord, to avoid fraying. Nice touch.</li>
    <li> Small, cheap.  Basically works but not really 100% satisfactory or elegant solution to the problem.  It doesn&#x27;t fog, but it is annoying to take it on and off the wall and hold it up to the shower.... then water gets on the mirror making it not impossible, but not that comfortable to see the reflection.  Then sometimes it does start to fog and you have to take it off and hold it up to the shower.&lt;br /&gt;But I won&#x27;t lie.  I&#x27;m keeping it.  It&#x27;s hanging in my shower.  And for the moment, I&#x27;m not looking for something better.</li>
    <li> Works well in the shower. I tried their trick for keeping it fog free and it works.</li>
    <li> Great customer service!  This has to be the most genius and needed invention ever!  This mirror is practical for anyone.  It has so many uses.  I love using it to get the best face shave in the shower.  It&#x27;s also great for trips and hiking/camping excursions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND to everyone :)</li>
    <li> First, the lack of a star is basically because of the price. I feel this would be great at around $6-8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging - well done. Thorough and safe. Actually looks like something purchased in a very decent supply store&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Function - the mirror is clear and not cheap looking as far as reflection goes. It&#x27;s quite clear for a synthetic glass. The included rip cord is solid and well done and is quite generous in length. I would have liked the hole to be in the middle on the short edge, however it doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue getting your entire face in the reflection while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage - so far 5-10 minute showers are working out well. If you don&#x27;t do their procedure of making it fog proof it still works quite well with just one squirt of the showerhead. When using their method it works even better and I&#x27;d say it is one of the best I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional thoughts - is very light and I would not droo this anywhere. It&#x27;s extremely thin but doesn&#x27;t appear fragile, but again, it is nothing is want to drop on a semi hard surface. The cord can be useful as well if you&#x27;re creative and want to hang in various places and styles. The included hook is spot on and is a great touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final conclusion - price point is like to see it dropped by 15-20% which is the only negative thing I can say at this point. It has great reflective properties, holding up to the fog, included hook and cord are a great touch and I&#x27;m really happy. Wish I threw out my old one sooner</li>
    <li> Cool mirror. I wish it was actually more of the rose gold that is pictured rather than the plain mirror color that it is, but it serves its purpose well.</li>
    <li> Does it&#x27;s job well. I took mine off the cord and hang it on a hook, holding it in my hand when needed.&lt;br /&gt;If you rinse it in the warm water it doesn&#x27;t fog, yes, you will get water drops on it but you are in the shower. It is a little big to hold but I don&#x27;t hold it much. I put a suction cup hook on the shower wall at the optimal place to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remove from the hook.&lt;br /&gt;Rinse front and back about ten seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Return to hook.&lt;br /&gt;Shave.&lt;br /&gt;Remove, check and touch up while holding.</li>
    <li> We were disappointed in this mirror.  Spots and streaks seem to accumulate easily on it, making it a bit of a chore to clean up before you use it every time.  You can clean it up with soapy water easily, but it&#x27;s an extra step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The REALLY long nylon cord hanger isn&#x27;t the best for stability either.  It does have a little metal hook to hang the cord from at home; I suppose the cord would be handy when you don&#x27;t have the hook for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this mirror is OK if you&#x27;re using it a few times a week or just need an unbreakable mirror in the bathroom.  For everyday use, I&#x27;d find a different option.</li>
    <li> The product works but you have to put it under water first</li>
    <li> Great product - very useful. I hang it from my shower nozzle and it dangles 4 feet above the floor. It collects water spots from hard water but so what - they wash right off during the next shower. With poor vision, the mirror above the sink is too far away to see anything. The shower mirror is handheld so I can actually see myself to shave and floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could do this purchase over again I would buy two: one for the shower and one for the sink, where the contact lenses get put in.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not much to say. It&#x27;s a mirror on a rope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame that when you search &amp;#34;shower mirror&amp;#34; you just get glue and suction mirrors, where people report varying levels of success at getting them to stick permanently. And do you really want to stick them permanently anyway? I actually ordered one of those before noticing this clever solution, and promptly cancelled my order and got this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty impressed by the value. The &amp;#34;rope&amp;#34; part is of a much higher quality than I was expecting. It&#x27;s a dense, high-quality cord. The mirror is light and very clear. Edit: It becomes a little &amp;#34;cloudy&amp;#34; once in a while, I suppose due to soap scum, hardwater mineral deposits, or whatever that stuff is that naturally builds up on smooth shower surfaces. Whenever I notice that, I soak and scrub it with the same spray I use to clean the rest of my shower (about once every two months) and it&#x27;s clear as new again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for fogging, yeah, you follow the directions. Heat it up under the water for about 10 seconds on each side and it basically stays fog-free for about 5-10 minutes. Water beads, but you just splash it once in a while to clear that up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a pleasure it is to finally be able to shave in the shower. And no more leaning over the sink -- I can get close to this one effortlessly to see my little pores and follicles. The most efficient way to shave. Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus it actually comes with a small sticky hook, in case you want to mount it the traditional way. I haven&#x27;t tried it, but I thought that was worth mentioning, since the product details seem to leave that out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey look at that, there was alot to say after all.</li>
    <li> Works great and so nice to not have to worry about suction cups.</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror for the shower.  It doesn&#x27;t break and will be fog free if you follow the directions (run the water over it for about 15 seconds),.</li>
    <li> Very lite and easy to use. No problems yet after 6 months.</li>
    <li> The simplest hand mirror, for shaving and otherwise, I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure of using.</li>
    <li> This is the best mirror I&#x27;ve ever used.  It just works, no fogging, doesn&#x27;t get in the way and is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I use it in our outdoor shower. The hook and rope keeps it in place.</li>
    <li> Great little shower mirror. At first the mirror looked dull and it had lines/scratches on it. I figured it had plastic on it, but there was no lip on it to pull it off. Well, if yours is like this just keep scratching at it until you get the plastic film to lift up. The mirror now looks great and works great. Nothing fancy, but for the price it works great.</li>
    <li> It is what it says it is.</li>
    <li> The items was exactly what I had been looking for. If I heat it up as per the instructions it does not fog. You have to give it time under the water. Otherwise, you can shave right away and it will fog up after a few minutes when you no longer need it anyway. I was surprised at how light it was, which was nice... I had been worried it might fall and break. The sliding clip on the rope helps to adjust the mirror height.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband and he really likes it. It&#x27;s has a VERY clear mirror without distortion which he appreciates come time to shave. The rope was an unusual but great idea especially since we have textured tile in our shower and suction cups don&#x27;t stick. Great price too.</li>
    <li> I love this little mirror.  I like to shave in the shower and after going through a couple other suction type mirrors I gave this one a try.  I really like it, I hold it and there was a little getting used to holding it rather than having it attached to the wall but no big deal there.  I also really like that it packs easily and allows me to have a mirror in the shower when I&#x27;m on travel too, being able to shave in the shower in hotel rooms is nice.&lt;br /&gt;It stays fog free pretty well and holding it means it&#x27;s easy for me to rinse any time I need to.</li>
    <li> Works great. Just follow the simple directions.</li>
    <li> Buy it, use it, love it.</li>
    <li> This is for using on the road due to it&#x27;s more compact size. It will fit better in a carry on or suitcase. It&#x27;s smaller size means you have to hold it in your hand for the right angle to get the best shave or move yourself around the mirror.</li>
