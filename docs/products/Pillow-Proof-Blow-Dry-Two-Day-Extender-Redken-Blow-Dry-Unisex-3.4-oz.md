      <li>This keeps your hair soft, has a great scent.</li>
      <li>What I like most is that I can use it for a couple days and my hair looks AND feels clean.</li>
      <li>I do however like the light minty smell</li>
      <li>The absolute BEST dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>It absolutely is the best dry shampoo out there!</li>
      <li>I even use it when my hair is clean.</li>
      <li>but once you use it &amp; set your hair it&#x27;s not going to be pleasant for that &#x27;romantic stroking&#x27;</li>
      <li>By far the best dry shampoo out there!</li>
      <li>Makes your hair smell fresh and clean and not greasy.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
      <li>If your husband or boyfriend enjoy running their fingers thru your hair - well your hair will pretty much be hands off while using the product .</li>
      <li>Instead of daily shampooing, I get two extra days of beautiful hair with lots of body.</li>
      <li>Good product quality, plus it was delivered only in 4-5 days in Standard shipment.</li>
      <li>I found that I am able to skip a day of shampooing if I use this Redken Pillow Proof dry shampoo spray.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair that gets oily in the back from sleeping</li>
      <li>I does not leave really any smell</li>
      <li>and I guess I just didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference in my hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the smell, but can get passed it.  </li>
      <li>Most dry shampoos make your hair look decent but</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only one I use anymore, worth every cent!  </li>
      <li>Dry shampoo usually works pretty good on my kid</li>
      <li>but I really like it so far.</li>
      <li>It perks up the 2day old style and gets rid of the oiliness that occurs in hair around the face though hair was  recently washed and is otherwise fresh..</li>
      <li>The only downside is I may have used a lot of this spray on my hair the first time.</li>
      <li>Works fantastic if you don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday.  </li>
      <li>but it left her hair very greasy.</li>
      <li>I like this stuff just to save time from having to wash ,dry, and use hot curlers every day .  </li>
      <li>Suave dry shampoo works better and cost less than $3 for over 6 Ozzy of product that really lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>My hair is pretty oily and doesn&#x27;t last long after I wash it, but now I can now go three days without washing my hair.  </li>
      <li>(major factor for me)</li>
      <li>so I always had to take a shower in the morning to clean my hair everyday!</li>
      <li>it is a little too heavy for my very fine hair</li>
      <li>And even after my natural hair has started to come back in this product still works .</li>
      <li>I have tried just about every dry shampoo out there, from store brands you get at Target to products from high end salons.</li>
      <li>I thought this worked as well, maybe a little better than the other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
      <li>I have tried some dry shampoo with my natural hair and they never worked for me.</li>
      <li>This product is invaluable for the busy woman who does not have the time to wash, dry and style every day.</li>
      <li>It gives fine thin lifeless hair the body &amp; shine</li>
      <li>I had really high expectations and was let down both my how it felt in my hair and the smell.</li>

<li> so I just got a flat look.</li>
<li> It does not leave a white film like other dry shampoos,and I&#x27;ve used several.</li>
<li> It also doesn&#x27;t have a weird odor like many of the other dry shampoos out there.  </li>
<li> There is a little white residue left from this product but after rubbing it in with your finger tips, it&#x27;s gone.</li>
<li> I feel like it hasn&#x27;t lasted very long either</li>
<li> I have never had a dry shampoo</li>
<li> THIS is what dry shampoo should be.</li>
<li> I needed to find a dry shampoo that would work because I was coloring my hair to Purple</li>
<li> Redkin Pillow Proof Blow Dry</li>
<li> Leaves your hair so dry</li>
<li> Haven&#x27;t used dry shampoo in years, boy has it improved!  </li>
<li> I am one of those people who need to wash my hair every day or it looks like big greasy mess.  </li>
<li> and I either am left with a bad residue or smell of a strong perfume smell.  </li>
<li> It may have helped my hair a little, but overall, I think I would have done just as well without using it.</li>
<li> Two Day Extender really works well on thin hair.</li>
<li> I have platinum blonde hair and so many leave a weird residue behind or make your hair feel stiff.</li>
<li> Can usually get an extra day without washing when in a crunch</li>
<li> I am a big fan of John Frieda&#x27;s dry shampoo, but it is no longer on the market and very hard to find.</li>
<li> what it does other than makes your hair smell a little nicer.</li>
<li> and I needed to wash it less.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s a lot in the can (a little over 3 ounces), so use it sparingly.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times now</li>
<li> I then use my curling iron to fix up any messy ends.</li>
<li> how can you not love it?</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not really sure</li>
<li> the second you touch it, you can tell it&#x27;s dirty.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used other brands which either smelled weird or made my hair even greasier.  </li>
<li> It gives my thin hair an OOMPH that Guts can not.</li>
<li> Not the worst I&#x27;ve used, but I didn&#x27;t find this product to be as effective as Rockaholic, or Pssst, and my husband HATED the smell.  </li>
<li> My hair did not feel sticky or weird after use.</li>
<li> Horrible.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s nasty</li>

    <li> Love this product. I even use it when my hair is clean. It gives my thin hair an OOMPH that Guts can not.</li>
    <li> I like this. I am a big fan of John Frieda&#x27;s dry shampoo, but it is no longer on the market and very hard to find. So I got this on a whim. It does not leave a white film like other dry shampoos,and I&#x27;ve used several. It is also very light. The only downside is I may have used a lot of this spray on my hair the first time. It doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s a lot in the can (a little over 3 ounces), so use it sparingly. Otherwise, it&#x27;s ok and I may purchase it again.</li>
    <li> The absolute BEST dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> This is miraculous!!!  I have very fine, oily hair. Instead of daily shampooing, I get two extra days of beautiful hair with lots of body.</li>
    <li> Totally worth the money. My hair deies faster and curlers alot better!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have tried just about every dry shampoo out there, from store brands you get at Target to products from high end salons. There is a little white residue left from this product but after rubbing it in with your finger tips, it&#x27;s gone. What I like most is that I can use it for a couple days and my hair looks AND feels clean. Most dry shampoos make your hair look decent but the second you touch it, you can tell it&#x27;s dirty. Well this product didn&#x27;t make my hair feel that way at all!!</li>
    <li> I needed to find a dry shampoo that would work because I was coloring my hair to Purple and I needed to wash it less. I have tried some dry shampoo with my natural hair and they never worked for me. I have fine hair that gets oily in the back from sleeping so I always had to take a shower in the morning to clean my hair everyday! My hair stylist recommend this product to me after we bleached my hair. and I was amazed at how well it worked! And even after my natural hair has started to come back in this product still works . On my 3rd can of this stuff its great!</li>
    <li> I thought this worked as well, maybe a little better than the other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used before. I do however like the light minty smell it seems to have.</li>
    <li> It may have helped my hair a little, but overall, I think I would have done just as well without using it. It may have extended my blowout 2 hours, but NOT 2 days!</li>
    <li> I am one of those people who need to wash my hair every day or it looks like big greasy mess.  I found that I am able to skip a day of shampooing if I use this Redken Pillow Proof dry shampoo spray.  I&#x27;ve used other brands which either smelled weird or made my hair even greasier.  This product actually works and I would recommend it to all my fellow greasy hair friends out there.</li>
    <li> Redkin Pillow Proof Blow Dry Two Day Extender really works well on thin hair. One of my favorite hair products.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo ever!  It&#x27;s the only one I use anymore, worth every cent!  I have platinum blonde hair and so many leave a weird residue behind or make your hair feel stiff. This keeps your hair soft, has a great scent. THIS is what dry shampoo should be.</li>
    <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!  My hair is pretty oily and doesn&#x27;t last long after I wash it, but now I can now go three days without washing my hair.  I have never had a dry shampoo last so long.  It also doesn&#x27;t have a weird odor like many of the other dry shampoos out there.  It absolutely is the best dry shampoo out there!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It works as described and will buy you an extra day or two before having to wash your hair again.  I don&#x27;t really care for the smell, but can get passed it.  My hair did not feel sticky or weird after use.</li>
    <li> it is a little too heavy for my very fine hair so I just got a flat look.</li>
    <li> Dry shampoo usually works pretty good on my kid but it left her hair very greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and I guess I just didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference in my hair. Maybe I&#x27;m not using enough or doing it correctly..</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo that still smells great.  Ive tried a bunch and I either am left with a bad residue or smell of a strong perfume smell.  The best!</li>
    <li> Not the worst I&#x27;ve used, but I didn&#x27;t find this product to be as effective as Rockaholic, or Pssst, and my husband HATED the smell.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Good product quality, plus it was delivered only in 4-5 days in Standard shipment.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, although not the best.  It smells nice (major factor for me) I had heard o almost provides volume too. It didn&#x27;t for me. I&#x27;m not really sure what it does other than makes your hair smell a little nicer. I feel like it hasn&#x27;t lasted very long either, it almost makes me feel like I was sold a used can? I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic if you don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday.  Makes your hair smell fresh and clean and not greasy.</li>
    <li> Works as says. Can usually get an extra day without washing when in a crunch</li>
    <li> I like this stuff just to save time from having to wash ,dry, and use hot curlers every day .  This product allows you to skip a day in-between and still have great LOOKING Hair .  But mind you-- If your husband or boyfriend enjoy running their fingers thru your hair - well your hair will pretty much be hands off while using the product . It gives fine thin lifeless hair the body &amp; shine it needs to remain &#x27;presentable&#x27; for more than one day but once you use it &amp; set your hair it&#x27;s not going to be pleasant for that &#x27;romantic stroking&#x27; our loved ones are used to but a couple of times a week it&#x27;s worth an Xtra 40 winks.</li>
    <li> This product is invaluable for the busy woman who does not have the time to wash, dry and style every day. It perks up the 2day old style and gets rid of the oiliness that occurs in hair around the face though hair was  recently washed and is otherwise fresh..</li>
    <li> By far the best dry shampoo out there!</li>
    <li> I have only had a chance to use this twice but I really like it so far. I does not leave really any smell I n my hair and it makes it not look greasy or like you are wearing your blow out a 2nd day. I just lift my hair up in layers and spray evenly and then use my fingers to comb through. I then use my curling iron to fix up any messy ends. Works great!</li>
    <li> Its Redken  how can you not love it?</li>
    <li> This product is just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;. I had really high expectations and was let down both my how it felt in my hair and the smell. There are much better products out there (Oscar Blandi and Toni &amp; Guy for example).</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used dry shampoo in years, boy has it improved!  It&#x27;s almost like a styling spray.</li>
    <li> Works OK but expensive. Suave dry shampoo works better and cost less than $3 for over 6 Ozzy of product that really lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Horrible.  Leaves your hair so dry it&#x27;s nasty</li>
