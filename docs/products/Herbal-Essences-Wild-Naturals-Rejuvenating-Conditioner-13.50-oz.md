      <li>I liked it.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t overpowering and it doesn&#x27;t linger in your hair, which is nice when you work in an office where you can&#x27;t wear scented</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This conditioner is a great product. I am African American with natural hair and this conditioner works wonderfully to help remove any tangles and knots and softens my hair! And it smells heavenly!</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this stuff - a pepperminty, figgy, lemon zest is the best description I can come up with. It wafted through the bathroom for awhile after my shower and even twelve hours later, I could still smell a hint of it in my hair. I usually alternate between Tresemme moisture conditioner and a Pantene color care version and it&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve tried any of the Herbal Essences products. This Turkish Fig conditioner was a welcome surprise - I have very thick, long hair (down to the middle of my back) and I spend a lot of time outside in the Texas sun, so conditioner needs to really work. It took about a half dollar size dollop to do all of my hair and there was no excessive greasy feeling - it rinsed clean. Brushing out wet was a cinch with no tangles. Once it&#x27;s dry my hair looks shiny and bouncy and there&#x27;s no flatness or oily residue that you can sometimes get from a moisturizing conditioner. I kind of love this.</li>
    <li> Herbal Essences Wild Naturals has a lot to commend it. It felt amazing, smooth and silky as I worked it through my hair in the shower. It did leave my hair soft. However, I have very thick hair that requires a product that is a bit more stout in order for me to get the manageability I prefer. This is definitely a quality product and I feel that all who have any but the thickest, most stubborn hair will be very pleased with this conditioner. It is quite luxuriant.It will work for thicker hair as well but it may not be able to offer a full level of manageability to those with a &amp;#34;lions mane&amp;#34; of already full bodied hair.</li>
    <li> I got this conditioner as a sample from influenster, and I must say it really conditions my natural hair after shampooing with the rejuvenating shampoo that comes with the samples, and I was able to comb through easily without having to go through a lot of pain</li>
    <li> This conditioner not only smells incredible but leaves your hair soft and shiny!  My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this moisturized in forever!! Definitely do recommend this conditioner to everyone.  I was actually given a free sample of this conditioner by influencer to test and ended up going out and buying my own bottle its so incredible!</li>
    <li> I just got out of the shower from using my Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Conditioner trial that I got from Influenster.com to try for free and I am now the biggest fan of Herbal Essences!! I am going to order some on amazon.com now. The way it left my hair feeling is unbelievable. I recommend this to anyone that has dry, frizzy, unmanageable hair. Heck even if you have great hair you should definitely give this one a chance!!</li>
    <li> The conditioner smells great with the combination of fig and peppermint. It creates fullness and lightly moisturizes. The biggest letdown is that the shampoo is not sulfate free so I could not continue using it regularly. My hair breaks off when I use products with SLS in them. I will save it for a time when I run out of my better stuff.</li>
    <li> I received a sample from Influenster to review, and I have had great progress so far. This conditioner is amazing for my curls, and the great smell is a major plus. I like that it is safe to use on my scalp. I have severe dandruff and have been searching for a conditioner and shampoo set that will help clear it up. I am definitely hoping this will finally be the one. I also enjoy that it is rejuvenating, as I recently colored my hair, and need the extra boost!</li>
    <li> I thought that this conditioner might be a bit too heavy for me at first. It is really thick and coats your hair quickly. Its so slick that it made my shower slippery. However, when I rinsed it out, my hair felt silky and didn&#x27;t feel like there was product left in it. When I dried my hair it looked sleek and healthy, not weighed down. The scent is so powerful that it lasted all day. Its a nice, inexpensive option. I received a sample in a Voxbox from Influenster in the middle of winter and was very happy to find a product that rescued my brittle hair.</li>
    <li> I received a sample in return for my honest opinion, so here it is:&lt;br /&gt;This is a very light conditioner, no different from any other inexpensive drugstore type conditioner brand. The shampoo stripped my hair&#x27;s semi-permanent color and I could only run a comb through the lower parts that had the conditioner applied. There was no slip, no extra moisture as claimed, really no difference between this conditioner and the Tresseme&#x27; Platinum conditioner that I use to pastelize my color. I did use this to pastelize my lavender over my silver hair yesterday, and having the conditioner on for over an hour made my hair soft, but no more conditioned that I&#x27;d have expected, certainly not as hydrating as promised. The smell did not stick around post-wash, like TiGi BedHead line. Nothing special, use a coupon if you really need this. IN the attached photo, I used this conditioner then blew my hair out with Rusk Str8, so the smooth texture is more likely due to the Rusk product.</li>
    <li> I received the shampoo, conditioner, and oil elixir combo complimentary from influenster. I have light brown hair with highlights that is dry and frizzy at times. I love the sweet smell of the product and it lasts in my hair throughout the day. My hair was very soft with this conditioner.  I used the combo of three for 6 washes and did not see any changes except that my hair was still frizzy and dry. It was a little heavy in that my hair felt weighed down and flat from the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Just as I said about the shampoo, I feel the same way about the conditioner. Been using herbal essence for years and absolutely love the new blends of scents for this particular line. Makes my hair soft and luxurious all day</li>
    <li> I am finding this to be a good, lightweight conditioner.  It left my hair soft and manageable.  I love the fruity scent with hints of mint that doesn&#x27;t smell too sweet or fake.  It doesn&#x27;t highly perfume my hair, but does leave a subtle scent.  This is great for everyday conditioning.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this conditioner!  It is fruity with a mint undertone.  It isn&#x27;t overpowering and it doesn&#x27;t linger in your hair, which is nice when you work in an office where you can&#x27;t wear scented products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner left my hair very smooth, easy to style, and it didn&#x27;t weigh it down.  I have very fine, thin hair, so I have to be careful with conditioners.  This one worked perfectly!  In fact, my hair was easier to style today then it normally is.  It is creamy, spreads easily through your hair, and washes out clean.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I used this conditioner in conjunction with the classic &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; Herbal Essences which they now also have branded as the &amp;#34;Shine&amp;#34; collection. Together the two did make my hair feel a bit tamer than it has for most of the winter. This made it lay a bit smoother which lets your natural shine show nicely whether the product has &amp;#34;boosters&amp;#34; or not. I liked it.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that tends to be dry in some parts. I usually need products that moisturize.  This conditioner is not ideal for my type of hair.  I would definitely use it in a pinch, but it won&#x27;t be my go to conditioner.  It is best suited for people with normal hair.  It smells great and leaves a nice shine, but it doesn&#x27;t moisturize my curly hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner really makes my hair seem thicker and softer. With the furnaces going 24/7, it&#x27;s refreshing to feel my dry hair transform with more luster and body to it. I now wonder what else the cassia seed could be used for? Overall, this is a great product!</li>
    <li> If you have oily hair, this is fantastic- lightweight, with more natural ingredients than irritating ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry hair... sadly, it worked about as well on my hair as if I just took body lotion in my hands and rubbed it through my hair. I used quite a bit and had drier and frizzier hair than with my usual conditioner, and when I mixed it with some others it barely had an impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant scent, but it&#x27;s SUPER light-- don&#x27;t expect the classic Herbal Essence scent with this!</li>
    <li> I am a huge Herbal Essences fan and I like most of their lines. However, every once in awhile I try one that I just do not care for. Unfortunately that is the case with this Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the scent. I typically like figs and the scent of figs. I am not sure what the difference between regular figs and turkish figs are. This conditioner, has a very strong, heavy scent. It just does not smell good to me. It is overwhelming at first. Luckily, it does fade after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as conditioning power goes, it works great at first. By the end of the night however, my hair is feeling greasy and a little heavy. I normally don&#x27;t have this issue with Herbal Essences products. This conditioner is meant for moisturizing, so that may be the contributing factor. I have normal to oily hair. If you have dry hair, it may work great for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product works. It is just not the product for me. I recommend the new Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating line instead if you do not have dry hair.</li>
    <li> Nice, clean smell, and a light feeling as well! That is what our teen daughter said after washing the hair and applying the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Conditioner. She has long hair and washes it often, and is enjoying this product!</li>
    <li> I love this product, it makes my hair feels very smooth and hydrated. has a very sweet smell, not overwhelming , just right.. i have no cons about this product, i highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I was given this product from influenster to test and review. Being a die hard Herbal Essences fan I was super excited to see this in my mail box! The smell is awesome!  My hair felt clean and soft. Well nourished! This is now on of my favorite!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the shampoo as much. BUT the conditioner left my hair really soft and it brought my curls!! It didn&#x27;t leave them flat like other conditioners. It actually gave them core shine and volume. Woke up this morning FLAWLESS. I&#x27;m obssessed. I think I&#x27;ll buy the shampoo simply because it does go well with the conditioner. It&#x27;s crazy because I have the shampoo 3 starts because of its consistency but I&#x27;m giving the conditioner 5starts all around. :)</li>
    <li> I received a sample from Influenster and I must say, I really like the product. I recently colored the ends of my hair, which has left it dry and knotty. This conditioner eased out the knots very easily.  The conditioner really moisturized my ends feel soft and best of all about this product: the smell!  Not too strong, subtle floral and fruity scent.</li>
    <li> Made my hair super soft and had less static. I got this in my very first Vox Box from Influenster (everyone should join, it&#x27;s very fun) I will be repurchasing this once it runs out.</li>
    <li> I received this conditioner from Influenster to get my review. I was very excited when I received this because I love herbal essences, and this product has not changed my opinion on bit! It smells very nice and leaves your hair with a very soft feel. It also leaves the smell in the bathroom, which is very pleasant. I have wavy to slightly curly hair that is dry and it really helps!</li>
    <li> This pairs so nicely with the other products in this line.  While not all have the same scent, they compliment each other without smelling too perfumey.  This conditioner leaves my hair soft and manageable, which is perfect for my color processed hair.</li>
    <li> I got these in the mail and I tried them out and they smell and feel so good! They make my hair smell nice and as someone with dry brittle hair it made it feel soft for once. lol. So I hope that I find a cheap holy grail using these products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was sent these Items to review*</li>
    <li> I received the conditioner in a kit from influenster for free to try! I am very picky on my shampoos and conditioners. My hair is color treated and fairly damaged. When I first opened the bottle the smell was nice but when actually using it in the shower it was amazing! I loved the fruity scent but it had a clean fresh minty after tone to it. There are not many conditioners that can actually condition my hair to make it feel smooth but this one definitely did it. The scent also remained on my hair for the entire day which was awesome! I would highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> In a household with five females, you&#x27;re going to get your fair share of opinions on any hair care product.  This one was a winner with the straighter/thinner hair crowd but was only deemed OK by the curlier pair.  A great smell and a good moisturizing result.  At this price point it seems like a great option going forward.  Thick and curly hair (which I do not have so I&#x27;m relaying the message :) ) might require a more intense product, but this will be the value option.  I&#x27;m not sure why my Cassia needs to be &amp;#34;hand-harvested&amp;#34; or how it is typically harvested, but I assume this is all part of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; part of &amp;#34;Wild Naturals&amp;#34;.  I guess any leaning towards the right ideals is better than blind big business, but it&#x27;s the product that will incent the repeat purchase, not the wildness or the naturalness...</li>
    <li> Loving this shampoo it works well on my fine straight hair and doesn&#x27;t weight it down but leaves it soft and silky!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for just 4 days and my hair has never been this soft! I am in love with this product. I will be making this my permanent shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> I got a travel sized bottle of this, the shampoo and the spray oil in my VoxBox by Influnester(free). I love how long the scent lasts in my hair, how manageable and soft my hair is and how it leaves no build up. The oil spray is magic on my ends too.</li>
    <li> I received this to test and review. First off I would like to say that it does smell really good. tho I didn&#x27;t really see any change to my hair. I have dye damaged hair. My hair did feel clean after using. But something I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> I received Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Conditioner free from Influenster to test in my Vox Box. I had just seen the commercials for the Wild Naturals, but had not yet tried them. I used the conditioner along with the shampoo and oil elixir. I thought the conditioner complemented the shampoo very well. At times my hair gets brittle, especially near the ends, and I felt this product helped hydrate them and made them feel and look more healthier, shine, and smell great!  The smell is amazing and probably one of the reasons I enjoyed the product so much! It is a very good product and you really get your money&#x27;s worth. Overall, I would continue to use this product and refer it to my friends and family as well!</li>
    <li> Received this free to try through influenster.com and I am in love!! Left my hair soft and smelling amazing!!</li>
    <li> I recieved this product to test and review and I&#x27;m sold. I have very long color damaged hair, it breaks and is dry, I fight with it daily just to get a brush through it. Now however I&#x27;m extremely pleased with how easy this conditioner made it to brush the tangles and knots just disappeared. I had previous used herbal essence a few years ago and was not satisfied and I honestly never would have tried this without getting this as a test product but I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve had the opportunity!</li>
    <li> I was given a sample of this line from influenster. And i love this product! I dont usually use alot of conditions but i will use this! It smells great and if 2nd day is important to u then this is ur product</li>
    <li> This conditioner is fantastic. I have very fine, straight hair and this conditioner doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy or weighed down at all. It also helps that it smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> I just received my sample of Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Hair products. It was wonderful to try a new product that was all natural and worked so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the product free to test and review.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is the perfect daily conditioner. Leaves your hair soft, weightless, and shiny. Definitely recommend this product after the Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo.. Very happy with this line and fortunate enough to try the sample thanks to Influenster. Herbal essences is quality at an affordable price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to honest here, I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product when I got it in my influenster box. A few years back, I tried this brand but different conditioner and it didn&#x27;t do much. But this one is AMAZING! First of all, the smell is great. I feel like I&#x27;m on a vacation when I&#x27;m in the shower with this product. I have short hair but I have a lot. My guess was that I would need to use a big squirt of this. But, no. I use only less and it works for my whole set of hair. It leaves my hair soft, shiny and smelling fabulous. The conditioner isn&#x27;t a thick consistence which for me is great. My hair is damaged due to the constant change of hair color and bad shampoos I try. This conditioner made my hair 3x softer on the first use. I felt like I had actual hair again, not gummy hair.</li>
    <li> I use nothing but Herbal Essences’s shampoos and conditioners, which is why I was so ecstatic when they released this new wild naturals collection. Using this conditioner creates the illusion of being on the beach drinking a fruit smoothie out of a coconut whilst a shirtless, Brazilian man in khakis massages your feet. The scent of this product is powerful enough to compel the most stubborn people to fall under your total control, but yet subtle enough to leave a sense of intrigue. Not to mention that my hair is soft enough to use as a blanket. 4 thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> I did not like the way it made my hair feel. I had to add more leave in conditioner afterwards.</li>
    <li> This had a pleasant scent, which was surprising since I don&#x27;t usually like fig scents. Although advertised as natural, this conditioner has a number of artificial ingredients that I generally try to avoid, so I&#x27;ll probably only use it occasionally. I received this as a free sample.</li>
    <li> Received a trial size of this condition for free from Influenster! I used this condition after I first used the Herbal Essence Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo &amp; I loved how it made my hair feel smooth, silky and overall great! I normally have staticky, dry hair and this conditioner gave it back plenty of moisture back and I am overall satisfied with how these products work! They definitely do what the label says they do. Not to mention, The smell is mesmerizing! Smelled absolutely wonderful and wasnt too strong! Ive had many comments on my hair after using these products! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> This product, like all other Herbal Essences&#x27; products, smells amazing!  A small amount goes a long way.  It made my hair soft and smell great.  The only reason I did not rate this product higher is because other than the scent - this product is just a regular conditioner. I have very thick and somewhat frizzy hair which requires more control and product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to someone with healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  I received this product complimentary to test and review.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is not my number one favorite, but it is up there on my list. I love that the smell stays on my hair for a long time. It even does the job. My hair felt softer (although, not very soft) than normal. This lasted to the next day after I showered. I like the condition in this line more than the shampoo in this line. **Product was sent free of charge by Influenster to review.**</li>
    <li> Shortly shampooing my hair and treating it with HERBAL ESSENCES WILD NATURALS REJUVENATING CONDITIONER, I turned into a wild creature and a natural knockout.  I ran through the streets naked, my luscious locks whipping through the air, and swung from tree branches, ultimately alighting to fashion a home out of fallen leaves and grasses.  I went on to set up a collective of wild and natural women.  Every day we would apply our conditioner and drape ourselves in refreshing botanicals.  Then we would grow all our own food, raise our children to be feral, and wrestle evil with our bare hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, one day, using a magnifying glass I ground myself out of a discarded wine bottle, I read the ingredients: Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Cetyl Alcohol, Ficus Carica Fruit Extract, Mentha Piperita Oil, Menthol, Mentha Arvensis Leaf Oil, Cassia Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Fragrance, Benzyl Alcohol, PEG-2M, Disodium EDTA, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I realized, sadly, that our wild and natural lifestyle was merely an illusion, a figment of a sad Methylchloroisothiazolinone-induced dream.  In fact, the whole thing was probably an allergen-induced delusion, since Methylchloroisothiazolinone is a known allergen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I returned to my humdrum life.  HERBAL ESSENCES WILD NATURALS REJUVENATING CONDITIONER no longer had the power to turn me into a wild and natural creature.  Instead, I was a woman d&#x27;une certaine age with the same wispy locks as before, though they now smelled a lot like a fruit salad, and a bit of a red flush around my hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: it&#x27;s so-so as a de-tangler, can cause an allergic reaction (mine was mild and went away quickly) and has a strong fruity odor.  And while I like fruit, and I like having hair, I don&#x27;t think the two need to spend quality time together.</li>
    <li> I loved the smell and how well it lathered in my hair it made it more manageable and a lot less frizzy I would buy this product again I got this through an app called influenster where you review product and give your opinion for other influensters !</li>
    <li> I received this product for free testing ! , I tried  shampoo and this type of conditioner, I thought at first this might be good for my type of hair, I have curly hair and is a really bad type of hair for first try , however I liked the results, it is very fruity and The size is great , i usually wash my hair twice and I also use a hair mask and i leave in conditioner on the edges for a few minutes. Whit this conditioner I only used it one after shampooing and used the oil as well, I used a curling Iron and my hair looked fantastic, I have oily roots and for me it worked out,after 1 week of use I can tell is shinier ,smelling great and stopped falling off, I had this issue over 3 months ago when i started using a different shampoo, I even got dandruff, and I am happy this has not happened with this new line, today I went to a friends meeting and I got a comment on my smell, and I don&#x27;t use perfume or dyes so it is nice to have a clean and fresh smell with me.</li>
    <li> I loved Herbal Essences Wild Natural Rejuvenating Conditioner. I received it for free to review and from the first day I received the product I was sold. This conditioner makes my hair so very soft. And my hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down from the conditioner as it is very light and effective. Deffently would buying!</li>
    <li> I was given this with the collection to review and i think it is okay. it smells good and works well on my hair. I wish the scent of it was stronger.</li>
    <li> Even using a very small amount weighs your hair greasy.  It makes your hair heavy and unpleasant.  On the positive side, it seems nice.</li>
    <li> I received this conditioner Free from Influencer. I love the smell &amp; it works well for short &amp; long hair. It didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy or have a residue. My hair was soft &amp; shiny. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have hair that is down to the middle of my back. I have a LOT of hair, but it&#x27;s not thick. I also do not color my hair, so it&#x27;s all natural. I live in a tropical environment, I go to the beach a lot, I am a Mom who spends little to no time on doing my hair or putting on my make up, unless it&#x27;s a special occasion. So I can honestly say I am low maintenance. BUT I also want to still feel pretty, I haven&#x27;t put on sweat pants and given up on life.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is funny, because of of the salt water and no dying, it&#x27;s dry on the bottom and can get greasy on the top, so finding a good conditioner to balance that is tough. ESPECIALLY when I hate blow drying my hair and letting it air dry tends to make it look..well, like I keep a hair tie close by when I need to go in public.&lt;br /&gt;HE conditioner let a little go a long way, which was nice, because I hate running out of conditioner and then having enough shampoo to last a few more weeks left, but buying two new bottles. Not here, this product I could use the an equal dollop of both and it did the job of cleaning and conditioning my hair. YAY!&lt;br /&gt;I get out and comb my wet hair, and it is soft and no tangles. YAY!&lt;br /&gt;I let it air dry and it doesn&#x27;t look like the end of a broom. YAY!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m bummed that this was just a sample from Influencer and I will have to replace it soon. ;-)</li>
    <li> I received the shampoo, conditioner, and oil elixir combo complimentary from influenster. I have light brown hair with highlights that is dry and frizzy at times. I love the sweet smell of the product and it lasts in my hair throughout the day. My hair was very soft with this conditioner. I used the combo of three for 6 washes and did not see any changes except that my hair was still frizzy and dry. It was a little heavy in that my hair felt weighed down and flat from the conditioner</li>
    <li> The problem with this conditioner is that how it works depends on the type of hair you have (which isn&#x27;t too much unlike other conditioners).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 10 year old daughter used it and she not only loved the smell, she also has found that her hair is much easier to control, and in Vermont&#x27;s frigid cold weather her hair was filled with static. This conditioner actually helps keep the static down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair, however, didn&#x27;t fare as well. I took a shower on Thursday evening. By Saturday morning my hair was very greasy-looking. I can usually go two days without having to wash my hair but this conditioner has shown that my hair is apparently more greasy than I thought it was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of this conditioner is the smell - it smells FABULOUS. I now have an obsession with finding other fig-smelling items to see if they smell as good!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERDICT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry hair, this is ideal for you. If, however, your hair tends to go to grease rather than dryness, you may want to find another conditioner.</li>
    <li> The conditioner truly smells great, but performance....well, not so great.  It&#x27;s on par with most conditioners out there though, so if you are one of those lucky people who don&#x27;t need heavy conditioning for dry hair, go for it; you will love this product!</li>
    <li> I sort of love trying out new shampoos and conditioners because I hate to think I am missing out on the latest greatest new products...and I get bored.  I started out trying the Lemon Basil Detoxifying conditioner and was so pleased with the results for the price point (and ease of picking it up at the drug store) that I started trying the other versions. So far I have liked them all, but this one might be my favorite. I have fine, full, long hair with some gray. I do color it, so it can easily feel dry if I do not use the right products. I always use a color safe shampoo, but sometimes use what I have around the house for my daughter&#x27;s hair as a conditioner. (I always try out new shampoos/conditioners for her first) This one leaves my hair feeling silky smooth with the added benefit of taming the fly away gray hairs that can require a spritz of hair spray to force down. My hair is not plastered to my head or greasy feeling, but it is smoother to my head, so I don&#x27;t know if this would be the right conditioner for everyone. This has a very fruity fragrance and I really like it.</li>
    <li> This conditioner has a very pleasant smell, both when in  use and after your hair has dried. My hair is a hodgepodge of straight, kinky, curly, and wavy hairs, ranging from light brown to black along with white and silver - all of different textures. Think to yourself: Australian Cattle Dog. My curly dry hair doesn&#x27;t seem to hold in as much moisture with this conditioner, but my hair is still very soft to the touch - but dry hairs will kink up on top of my head a bit - but far less than when not using the conditioner. The bottle is easy to hold in the shower and the top flap opens easily and snaps shut. The scent is fresh, slightly fruity, but not overly perfumy or floral, which I like.</li>
    <li> This conditioner makes my hair -- and the floor of my shower -- downright slippery in use. My hair ends up easy to comb through when wet and soft when it dries. It doesn&#x27;t flatten out my curls or leave me with frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of Turkish fig is pretty but not lingering, so it won&#x27;t conflict with your perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great conditioner for regular use.</li>
    <li> I was kind of disappointed in using this product after the coordinating shampoo. The shampoo smelled great, while this one was not such a pleasant scent. It worked well enough for my hair, and I am always on the look out for the best conditioners. I&#x27;m not sure this is the best one for me, but not a bad product. I received a free sample from Influenster!</li>
    <li> I received this conditioner in my complimentary Influenster package and I really enjoyed it. I wasn&#x27;t too fond of the scent at first, but after coming out of the shower it mellowed out to a nice, gentle fragrance. The conditioner was hydrating enough to handle my long hair as well. Overall I think it is a good value for the price and I would consider purchasing products from this line.</li>
    <li> while i love the scent of this conditioner in my opinion it was a little thinner than other herbal essence conditioners i have used in the past. i did receive this product free to review and i do enjoy it and it will be used i just would like for it to be a little bit thicker i do have bleached hair so my hair needs a little more moisturizing qualities. but the scent stays in your hair all day long.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to see that this conditioner didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. I have very thick curly hair and it can be very temperamental when it comes to conditioners. I found that this conditioner smelled amazing and gave me a little pep in my step in the morning. It also made my hair soft and shiny which I was excited about! I got this in the trio of free samples from Influenster and was not disappointed.</li>
    <li> These products are awesome...... They allowed my hair too breathe along with adding body. Based on my personal experiences with herbal experiences with herbal essence these products or by far the best produced. I first co-washed my hair with the rejuvenating shampoo, allowing that too marinade for 15 mintues shortly after following up with the conditioner then the elixir oil... These three products or now within reach of my daily hair routine . This is not a paid review or subscription along with the free products I received..</li>
    <li> I received this line of products free for testing and review purposes and I LOVE them!! I have been using this product, along with the shampoo and oil, and they are amazing!  I used them on my hair for 3 consecutive washes and then switched back to my regular shampoo/conditioner. I also left the conditioner in each time for 5 minutes, to deep condition my hair, and it really did! I was also amazed at how quickly my hair stated to dry back out after I stopped using the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating line and went back to my normal hair products. I also noticed that my hair has not been as oily since I began using this product. Since receiving these products for review, I have purchased the full size items. I highly recommend these products! They are amazing!</li>
    <li> I got this conditioner, shampoo and oil fixer in my voxbox and I must say I loved all three of them!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They all helped my hair look less dry and damaged! A little bit goes along way! The oil fixer is awesome and probably my favorite thing out of all three! The best part is they all three smell great too!</li>
    <li> Great conditioner ! Smells great and my hair is soft and full of volume ! Thanks to Influenster I was able to try it for free !</li>
    <li> this product is very very good. i usually only use herbal essences hello hydration but now i think this is one of my new favorite conditioner.The smell is so amazing like the rest of the other products in the line and leaves my hair so soft. i got this product for free to test and review but when i run out i will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I was impressed with the complimentary trial bottle I received to test. It arrived and I figured it would be like any other conditioner, but, it worked really well on my long and straight hair. It took away the frizzies and my hair was very flexible and more manageable even with split ends.  I think I&#x27;ve found my fix! Thanks to Clairol and Influenster.com.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this product when I first received it. Unfortunately that excited died down quickly. As odd as this may sound this conditioner dried my hair out. I tried it on numerous separate occasion and each time I have to follow up with a different conditioner in order for my hair to not feel so brittle. I really wanted to like this but it was an unfortunate disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. I received this from Influenater to test and try for free. I have also have a problem with rats nests and tangles in my hair. This product lets me brush through my hair no problem after getting out of the shower and it smells great</li>
    <li> It takes some heavy conditioning for my thick frizzy wavy hair to calm down and untangle.&lt;br /&gt;It is impossible to smooth out without any conditioner after shampooing and I have used countless brands of conditioner, most without much results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one has a great mango scent and untangles as well as any I&#x27;ve used.  It smooths my hair a small amount, imparts no shine, untangles very well, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or flatten or oil it.  It is a fairly standard conditioner without any outstanding qualities although I do love the scent and I feel that is the best thing about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for the scent and the untangling ability of this I recommend this as well as leaving my hair feeling clean and without a lot of product to weigh my hair down or make it need shampooing more often.</li>
    <li> We have the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Illuminating Conditioner and Shampoo. I have used it on my natural but somewhat chemically treated/colored hair it couldn&#x27;t be my go to hair product but for occasional use it certainly smelled pleasant and gentle I had to take several deep relaxing breaths to enjoy it. It left my hair soft with some volume and fairly manageable. It did work very well for my daughters hair she has natural curly thick long locks. They were soft easy to detangle smelled great she loved the scent in the end it is a good product for a fair price.</li>
    <li> Not a deep conditioner like Pantene or Dove, this is more of a lighter conditioner. My hair still looked great after using it, but i need a little bit more than I would when using Pantene. My hair is over 2 feet long and i feel like i have to use a pretty good amount of this conditioner to get enough worked into my hair. This bottle will probably last me two weeks, taking a shower everyday. Cost wise, this probably isn&#x27;t the best conditioner for people with really long hair or that want that deep conditioning feel. I have used other herbal essence products and this is very similar to the conditioning strength of their other products. The smell is great, very sweet and floral.</li>
    <li> I have extremely fine, very thick hair which may sound like a contradiction.  I am a redhead and as I understand it, redheads have more hairs per square inch than any other color.  This leads to thick hair overall but in order to fit all those hairs in, each hair has to be fine.  The result?  My hair tangles REALLY easily.  I have found that I have to use a high quality conditioner or I can&#x27;t get a brush through it after washing at all.  I.e., I will use Suave shampoo but their conditioner is way too thin and watery to do me much good.  So - I have always been a Pantene girl.  To be honest, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever tried an Herbal Essences product before.  But I was very pleasantly surprised to find that this conditioner is very thick and very smooth.  It looked good being pumped from the bottle into the palm of my hand.  It felt good being smoothed into my scalp and hair.  It smelled good as I massaged it in, but the perfume smell was not overwhelming.  And, my hair brushed out easily after being washed - which is the most important factor to me.  I would definitely recommend and would buy again.  Update: 12/2/2015.  I&#x27;ve reduced my rating to 4 stars from 5 because after using this a few times, I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t getting the tangles out as well as the Pantene I&#x27;ve traditionally used.  The scent of it is lovely but it just doesn&#x27;t do as good a job of detangling as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> Got the Herbal Essences Turkish Fig Conditioner and the  Seaberry Shampoo to test from Vine. Now my hair smells like a weird fruit salad.  Both of these products do their basic job, clean and condition, but no one has called me a vixen despite the shampoo bottle&#x27;s claim it will bring this hitherto undiscovered personality trait out in me. In fact, my personality traits seem oddly the same. I really can&#x27;t recommend either product, nor condemn them.  If your father smelt of Elderberrys and you WANT to smell of Turkish Fig to be different, dive in.  But this is not that green Herbal Essence of the days of yore that really had a punch to it. So, enjoy it in the shower (or wherever you scrub your crown). Its fine for what it does, but its nothing special</li>
    <li> I like the CLAIROL HERBAL ESSENCES WILD NATURAL HAIR CONDITIONER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice grapefruit scent and leaves my hair nice and soft.  I&#x27;ve got very thick and dry hair so I usually have to apply some leave-in conditioner, otherwise my hair will end up looking like a Q-Tip, so this was no different. However, even without that extra step my hair was nice and soft with just rinsing with this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s other stuff in the ingredients like a lot of alcohol derivatives (I assume to stabilize the other ingredients) so be aware of that fact. Also, I haven&#x27;t notice the conditioner striping out my hair color or causing any scalp irritation so that&#x27;s also a plus.</li>
    <li> The truth? I like this conditioner because it goes on nice and thick and smooth. When I message it into my scalp, I can feel it really wrapping my hair like a helmet.  And that&#x27;s why I like it so much.  My curly hair looks still very curly and bouncy when it dries, just as before.  Comb out is fast and easy, but then, my hair is only a few inches long. Not much fragrance, and I kind of like that.  I was quite bowled over by Herbal Essences claim to include &amp;#34;wild&amp;#34; naturals in this product, &amp;#34;hand-harvested&amp;#34; cassia and &amp;#34;revitalizing turkish fig essences&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve been using Herbal Essences since back in the day when it came out in the alternative green bottle and claimed to have &amp;#34;natural protein&amp;#34;.  (That was before we all became vegan.) Today no one would settle for so vague a term; we must have revitalized turkish fig essences.  I wonder what exotic essences the future will bring us? Harvested from the mountains of Tibet or the bottom of the sea?</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product! This conditioner is has a great consistency and washes right out with no oily residue. I thought the scent would be over powering, but it&#x27;s just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product free to test and review.</li>
    <li> Usually, any moisturizing conditioner works well for my pretty dry hair. Not this one though. I am quite surprised by just how ineffective this conditioner is. It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;rejuvenate&amp;#34; my hair, it doesn&#x27;t even detangles it, like any conditioner does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think the design of the bottle is not very efficient. You know how thick conditioners are and how much they benefit from being put upside down to squeeze some more out of them. This bottle wasn&#x27;t designed to be put on its head, so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely wouldn&#x27;t buy for myself.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product and I got it for free from Influenster. It made my hair soft which is amazing because I have a lot of damage from coloring. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free, and I&#x27;m in love with the smell as a woman of african American woman and has a biracial child this product worked wonders on our hair! Will be buying this again.#VoxBox</li>
    <li> I received this Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo in a complimentary (ie: free) VoxBox in order to test and review the product.  I found the shampoo lathered well &amp; rinsed easily, left my hair with a fresh slightly fruity scent.  My hair felt clean but not overly stripped after using the shampoo. I normally use salon products on my hair, but will definitely finish my sample bottle and may purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> The conditioner is okay,but far from great has a awful smell.I really don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free to test and review via Influenster along with the shampoo and oil elixir. I loved this conditioner. Paired with the Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo, it made my hair very soft and smelled really nice with a fresh fruity Turkish fig scent (I never knew what &amp;#34;Turkish fig&amp;#34; smelled like until now!) I mentioned in my review about the shampoo that the product didn&#x27;t necessarily make my hair feel stronger compared to hair products sold in hair salons, however Herbal Essences is my go-to brand in other stores and this new Wild Naturals product is my new favorite. Not only is the scent great but it did make my hair feel rejuvenated and smooth.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the shampoo but still smells wonderful! It makes my hair feel nice wet but not as soft as some of H.E.&#x27;s other products.</li>
    <li> I have waist length hair that is really, really thick. I have problems finding good conditioners/shampoos because it fritzes easily.&lt;br /&gt;I think this combo is good for people with hair not as thick as mine, because I’ve tried the combo three times and each time it didn’t work out too well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner helps a bit, but it doesn’t really calm my hair down….and I’ve used the conditioner separately (without shampooing my hair), a little amount with shampoo and, a lot with shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Each time my hair didn’t come out the winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don’t think this combination works for me, but it might for other people.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I got these products free to test and review through Influenster</li>
    <li> I recieved this product from Influenster as a promotion to try the product for free. I LOVE IT!!! My hair felt great after using it and the fragrance is wonderful. I used it with a combination of the shampoo, and also the oil elixir and my hair felt and looked super conditioned and moisturized. I can tell that it has helped with the frizz I usually fight with and also fewer flyaways when I put my hair up in a ponytail. I would definitely recommend these products!!!!</li>
    <li> I rcvd this product free to test from Influester. My hair normally goes from straight to wavy in no time. I found this product to leave my hair shinier, hydrated more than the usual products I use. Found the smell to be fantastic. Would purchase and also recommend others to try it .</li>
    <li> I received this for free to test from Influenster. I am using the conditioner with the shampoo. Conditioner works well. It does not wiegh my hair down or leave a greasy feeling. My hair is shiney and looks healthy. Smells good as well. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product in my opinion works very well. I already loved this brand. It&#x27;s made my hair more soft and it smells devine.</li>
    <li> Not a very good conditioner for my hair.  It left my hair tangled and unmanageable.  Even after drying, my hair was frizzy and dry, and I was unable to style it as I normally would.  I did not find it &amp;#34;rejuvenating&amp;#34; in any way, except that it reminded me of having tangled hair as a child after my bath!&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  I received a sample of this product for review through Influenster.  The opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the conditioner, shampoo, and oil serum from the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals rejuvenating line. I received the 3 products as samples from Influenter.com. The sample size were more than I expected and I thankful for that. I used these products on my naturally curly hair in the order of conditioner to detangle, shampoo to cleanse, and elixir for shine. The smell of the products were consistent. The smell is fruity, clean, feminine, and a slight hint of fig. I like it. The products did not moisturize my hair, but they did help to detangle, cleanse, and add shine. I will surely use the samples in its entirety for my wigs and hair pieces, but I will not likely purchase these products as I have natural hair and I like natural products for my hair only.</li>
    <li> I LOVED this conditioner. I received it free from influenster to try and review, and I am very glad I did. This is the best smelling conditioner I have ever used. My hair feels great, and it smells like candy. Its not &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; per se, but I&#x27;m not going to harp on that. If you&#x27;re looking for a conditioner that makes your hair smell &amp; feel nice, then I&#x27;d say buy this. Its awesome.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this product.  It worked really nice with my hair type and left it shiny and smelling delicious.</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo and conditioner. It smells amazing and makes my hair extremely soft and I dye my hair and bleach it all the time. I will only buying this products from now on. I will be recommending to all my family and friends and spreading the word all over. Best herbal essences products around.</li>
    <li> Fresh smelling and makes my hair feel great and plent hydrated!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo conditioner and oil elixir intense condtion. Smells so good and my hair is silky soft!!!</li>
    <li> I had received this as a sample from Influenster to try. I love Herbal Essence, but I&#x27;m not sure that I would purchase this one out of all the other choices. It wasn&#x27;t amazing smelling and didn&#x27;t seem to blow me out of the water with making my hair softer or less frizzy. For me it was just average ....not terrible but not amazing.</li>
    <li> I got this to review from influenster in little sample bottles about 3oz in size. Of all the three products I received this was my favorite. It smells wonderful and it distributes well throughout my hair. I like the consistency and texture of the conditioner. It does moisturize my hair. I would purchase this with my own money.  I would consider buying other conditioners from this Herbal Essences Wild Naturals line of products.</li>
    <li> Left my hair feeling limp and stringy. I am a firm believer in using salon quality shampoo and conditioner, and now I can confirm my belief. After only one day of use, I switched back to my salon quality stuff because my hair was much more tangled and dull looking than usual. But it does smell amazing!</li>
    <li> I got this product for free to test and review. I actually really like it! I have always been a fan of herbal essences products, but I have never tried anything from there naturals line. It left my hair super soft and shiny. The both the shampoo and conditioner smell great, and really removed any oils that I had on my scalp. The conditioner left my hair soft and shiny- even when I did not add any more product after showering. The shampoo did not leave a residue- which is great for me because I have fine hair and that can make my hair look limp. One thing I will say is that the smell is great! However, if you&#x27;re like me, and you don&#x27;t wash your hair every day, the smell changed as the days went on. The first day it was great, the second day it was ok, and by the third I felt like it smelled sour. Im sure thats just because of the fruits and oils they use but I just felt like I needed to wash my hair every other day rather than every third day. Overall, its great and I will be purchasing this in full size as soon as my sample runs out!</li>
    <li> So I had my doubts that this line scented with Turkish figs and Cassia (a flower) would smell good. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! My first thought is that is smells like bubble gum, sweet and warm. I left in for 5 minutes then rinsed well. I could tell my hair was well conditioned and felt silky smooth. Will definitely use again! I receive this product complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I as surprised at how good this Herbal Essences Conditioner works on my hair. It has a great scent, but more importantly my hair is smooth and soft after using, blow drying and styling. My daughters always love to try the different Herbal Essences products and I am happy to say that I really like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this works surprisingly good. Often times my experiences with new conditioners are pretty average, but this one hits a bit above average especially at the price. It&#x27;s affordable and it works well. I haven&#x27;t used this for a long period of time. Sometimes over time conditioners can weigh down hair and stop working as well, but this one so far has worked great on my dry hair and damaged ends.</li>
    <li> Good conditioner for the price. I have been desperately looking for a new conditioner for my naturally curly hair after my favorite shampoo/conditioner was discontinied.&lt;br /&gt;I used Herbal Essences during my college days. It&#x27;s affordable for a pretty good product. This formulation has a nice scent and I did feel it cut down on the frizz.&lt;br /&gt;I plan on purchasing the matching shampoo to see how the pair work together. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was asked to try and review the herbal essences wild naturals rejuvenating conditioner. Other then the fragrance transporting me to another place it also works. It moisturizer my hair so much, it felt better then going to a salon. My boyfriend loved how my hair smelled and felt, it&#x27;s like it had new life breathed into it. Just try it and you will see for yourself.</li>
    <li> I recieved Herbal Essences wild naturals rejuvenating shampoo and conditioner through influenster. when I used the shampoo in the shower it gave my hair a fresh, clean feel after I applied the conditioner I let it sit on my hair for a few minutes and it left my hair silky smooth. After my shower I applied the oil elixir to the ends of my damp hair and styled as usual. Over all I love the products.</li>
    <li> I received this along with the shampoo and rejuvenating spray as a free testing purpose from influenster and it was great. Smelled awesome and my hair was completely rejuvenated. I recommend this to anyone with dry damaged hair. My previous shampoo was hard on my hair and this completely fixed the problem :)</li>
    <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals product free to test, but this review is completely my thoughts. First thought - I love the smell of these products! I have a lot of fine hair, but it&#x27;s naturally curly. The product is for &amp;#34;unleashing your hair&#x27;s natural shine&amp;#34; and that is what it did. I don&#x27;t think it gave a lot of body but if you&#x27;re looking for that shine this works very well! Plus it smells GREAT!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the way it leaves my hair feeling soft if wonderful. So gonna discontinue use of my old products and invest in this.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great, smells great, thick conditioner that easily coated my hair and my scalp, and left my hair so very soft, smooth, and well hydrated. My hair tends to be frizzy and this helped tame my crazy locks for sure. The price is very reasonable also and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to test this product as a free sample, and I was pleasantly surprised by this product. I have a very sensitive scalp, so I usually spend more money on more sensitive products since basic ones off the shelf usually irritate the dryness I have. I am not one to often go out and buy new products to try, but since this was a sample, I was open to trying this out though.&lt;br /&gt;I do not ever directly apply conditioner to my scalp so I cannot speak in that regard, but it definitely made my hair much smoother and silkier. You will feel the smoothness immediately after applying.  I have very dry looking hair and this conditioner made a difference in the appearance after blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing you will notice is how absolutely amazing it smells!! It is seriously amazing.  I do not like super strong scents and this one is just enough. I like that its smell is mild because usually the more potent the scent, the more chemicals are in it to irritate. This has just the right amount though.</li>
    <li> like how it leaves my hair feeling&lt;br /&gt;these are my own words&lt;br /&gt;i had received this in return for my review</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this for free and it&#x27;s a solid conditioner. I like the smell because it&#x27;s perfectly balanced and not too strong which is a plus. And the ingredients are good. I leave it on for 2 minutes and then rinse, my hair feels soft and smooth! Recommend!</li>
    <li> I really like the way my hair looks. This makes it silky-smooth and adds a nice shine. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> If you want beautiful smooth hair you have come to the right place because It&#x27;s amazing the name tell you how amazing it is 👌 thank you to influensters for letting me try this amazing product love it!!</li>
    <li> So I received this along with 2 other products to try out for free and review them. I&#x27;m always excited to try out new hair products. I love how it smells and how it didn&#x27;t leave any residue in my hair afterwards.  Even better is that if you are not looking to spend too much money on product this is really cheap! It left my hair feeling smooth and shiny!</li>
    <li> I like the product it smells great and left my hair super soft.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner! Leaves my hair easy to comb but not weighted down. Smells awesome too! Thanks Influenster for sending me product to review!</li>
    <li> I received this product free to test and review for free and was happy to find that this conditioner worked well, especially for the price (I tend to use higher priced hair products). It moisturized well, smelt great, and rinsed out well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added the conditioner to my normal hair routine because I wanted to see what the results would be. My normal hair routine is unique in that I tend to coconut oil my scalp and use a rinse of apple cider vinegar before shampooing my hair twice and i usually use a deep conditioner (my scalp is very dry). This conditioner did not irritate my scalp which was great and had a great smell that also helps mask the scent of apple cider vinegar rinse. It did not make my hair greasy or weigh my hair down like a lot of moisturizing conditioners but it is not as heave as some of the other conditioners I have used. I would recommend using this conditioner because it works well and leaves hair soft. I would also recommned using the product with the wild naturals oil post shower because it locks in moisture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I have to say is about the labeling it says natural on the label but it does seem that there are unnatural ingredients included unlike some of their other hair products lines like their naked products which are free of silicones, parabens, and dyes. I also mixed the conditioner with a little water and added to my ends as a leave in conditioner which helped my split ends. I would def recommend!</li>
