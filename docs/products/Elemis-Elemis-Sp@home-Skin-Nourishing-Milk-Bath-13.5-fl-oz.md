    <li> I use this once a week to keep my skin feeling nice and...well...nourished! Collagen does wonders and the results are very noticeable. I have eczema and this does not aggravate it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> By far the best milk bath ever!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It has such a soft, but clean smell and is so creamy.  Forget about putting it in your bath.  It&#x27;s not nearly as effective as using it as a lotion.</li>
    <li> I use this on my skin and on my then 6month old babies skin. It works for both of use. It took care of that baby eczema. I pour a cap full in her little baby bath and let her soak in it every other day for the last 2 months and her skin smoothed right out. Her pediatrition was skeptical at first but a month later told me to keep doing whatever I was doing for her skin because it was working.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite skin lotion because it&#x27;s so light and goes on without an extra perfume whiff.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it on a cruise once and keep on buying it.</li>
    <li> This came in today and it was nicely packaged and in great condition.  I bought my first one from the Spa in a cruise ship and I really love what it did for my skin.

    <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite products!  I mix it with the frangipani oil and use as a lotion.</li>
    <li> Expensive but leaves my daughters skin supper soft.</li>
    <li> Really creamy lotion, a little goes a long way, and makes the skin feel so soft.  Also an excellent price.</li>
    <li> Put it on my skin before I bath or shower. Let it soak in, then shower or bathe off. Leaves skin smooth and clean!!!</li>
    <li> This nourishing milk bath leaves your skin feeling soft.  The delightful fragrance lingers in your bathroom and on your skin for hours.</li>
    <li> I suffer from dry skin and taking a hot soak with this bath milk has helped a lot,</li>
    <li> This is great for smoothing on after a shower while still damp.  Keeps my eczema prone skin from getting itchy especially during the coldest and hottest months.</li>
    <li> Used it on a cruise, in the spa, as a skin conditioner, by rubbing it directly on the skin. I bought a bottle after that cruise and used it the same way. When I received the current bottle, it does not seem to be the same formula, or it is old, because it is all separated.</li>
    <li> We have had a extremely cold winter and this product has helped my dry skin . So happy to find it available.</li>
    <li> There was no seal on this product and it is very watery. I&#x27;ve gotten this from a cruise as well so I know what the consistency should be like, and this is not it.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites beauty items</li>
    <li> Love the Elemis products! I use this one as a moisturizer! It&#x27;s made my skin so soft!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before so I know what the consistency should be like.  When I opened this product from this vendor, I noted that the seal was broken.&lt;br /&gt;Also I noticed there was no end cap seal.&lt;br /&gt;However when I poured this product, it came out like milky water, not a glycerin base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be wary when purchasing this product from this vendor.  I ended up with less than 25% of the product in a water mix.</li>
    <li> Been using for years.  Love love.  My husband always tells me my skin is so soft.  I use as a lotion and swear it&#x27;s the secret</li>
    <li> I bought my first  bottle of Elemis Milk Bath on a cruise after a great spa treatment for my hands. I was having problems with dry, cracking hands. I tried all kinds of creams and lotions, yes even bag balm.  This milk bath, along with the Elemis Rehydrating Cleanser, are my new hand care products.  Now I wash my hands with the cleanser and apply the milk bath as a lotion. The cracked hands I had suffered with for 2 months are finally healed. I&#x27;ll be using this routine for at least the rest of this winter. Thank you Amazon for carrying these products.</li>
    <li> This is a super product leaves skin feeling smooth and hydrated but not greasy. Highly recommend it, I would recommend that the manufacturer provide a pump with the product</li>
    <li> My partner loves this. He has been using it for two years, and says it is the best body moisturizer . He likes the fragrance, it is suitable for  men or women.</li>
    <li> I have the roughest, dryest hands and the skin peels off. For years, I have tried every hand lotion/creme under the sun. None have helped. The Elemis Skin Nourishing Milk Bath is the FIRST product that has made them softer and not crack &amp; peel!!</li>
    <li> Love how this makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Disappointing it doesn&#x27;t seem as wonderful as when I first got introduced to it -&lt;br /&gt;tried using more of it when put into bath - but didn&#x27;t make a difference -</li>
    <li> Pricey but works well on dry skin.</li>
    <li> Had a spa day on a cruise to Alaska and the technicians were using Elemis products.  I&#x27;ve ordered several and love everyone one of them...will continue to use.</li>
