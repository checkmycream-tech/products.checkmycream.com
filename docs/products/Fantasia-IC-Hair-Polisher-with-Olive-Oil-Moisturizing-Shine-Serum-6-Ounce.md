    <li> Received this today.. I have been buying this product over 2 years and know for sure when I see a fake one. In fact, I still have my earlier bottle bought from Walmart and a quick comparison revealed that the is one was a fake. The print is different in the bottle I received with crucial manufacturing information missed out. The serum itself was much less viscous than the actual Fantasia product. I&#x27;ll not be bothering to return this, but goes directly to trash. Nowhere near my hair.</li>
    <li> Smells great, doesn&#x27;t weight down my thick wavy hair. It takes care of frizziness. I&#x27;m using it in place of gel. It works for me because half of my hair is straight. I love it!!!</li>
