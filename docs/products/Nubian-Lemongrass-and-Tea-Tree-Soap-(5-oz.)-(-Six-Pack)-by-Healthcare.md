<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this soap, the sent is pleasant and mild, and I like the ingredients! I use it for myself and my kiddos.</li>
    <li> Wonderful soap.  I love lemongrass and TeaTree.  My order was processed and delivery fast.  I am pleased.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable. I don&#x27;t have to worry about dirt on white towels any longer after a shower.</li>
    <li> OBVIOUSLY, I THINK THIS PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT.  I ORDERED 6 BARS OF IT.  IT&#x27;S REALLY GOOD FOR REMOVING MAKE UP EASILY, KEEPING HANDS SOFT FROM CHAPPING AND AS A BODY BAR WHEN NEEDED TO MOISTURIZE.</li>
    <li> Love this soap!  I participate in grappling sports and I attribute the use of this soap to maintaining good skin health.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great soap, smells great and leaves you feeling clean.</li>
    <li> It smell really good and lasts a long time. It&#x27;s not drying and best of all it&#x27;s all natural. yeay!</li>
    <li> Smells great when using but leaves no smell on your body. A bit hard to rinse off.</li>
    <li> Good price. Speedy delivery!</li>
    <li> feels nice on my skin</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I am so glad I found this product. My dermatologist told me my skin looks far younger than my age.</li>
    <li> I got this special soap hoping to solve my seborrhea, but have had only limited success, not sure at this time if I will reorder when I run out. 50/50 at this point in time</li>
    <li> great product, will purchase this again</li>
    <li> Good product, Thanks!</li>
    <li> Dries my skin,  does not work as good as my old scentless Tea Tree Soap.  I like the smell though.</li>
    <li> I have been on a quest for an all-natural soap - this is the first one that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  I was beginning to think it was simply the hard water.&lt;br /&gt;This soap smells wonderful, lathers nicely and doesn&#x27;t dry or leave skin feeling greasy.  Heaven-sent!</li>
    <li> Great soap! I love it! Will use it till they don&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
    <li> Pretty good soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells pretty strongly of lemon &amp; citrus - but not overpowering.  I like the scent, I find it pretty pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I come out of the shower squeaky clean,  no &#x27;residue&#x27; I get with some soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems as though a single bar will last you pretty well, maybe a month in my estimation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, when I opened up the packaging, I found a nice surprise, &amp;#34;Made in the USA.&amp;#34;  I had no clue where it was made before buying it, that was a nice surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing negative to say about this soap, I think the above say it all.  Chances are when I&#x27;m done with the six pack (of soap) I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
    <li> FEEL WHAT ORGANIC AND NATURAL THIS BAR SOAP IS. DEFINITELY BEST SOAP IVE EVER USED. I HAD SOME ACNE ON MY BACK AND THIS SOAP GOT RID OF IT. I HAD BEEN USING OTHER SOAPS AND THIS ONE DID THE TRICK. ITS A REALLY GOOD SOAP. I LOVE IT SO MUCH I BOUGH THE SIX PACK OFFER FOR 20$ WHICH IS A STEAL.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling clean &amp; healthy</li>
    <li> This soap may be good for someone with extremely oily skin. However, I have mildly oily skin and it dries me out.</li>
    <li> This soap is great for acne.  My daughter and I use it everyday!  Highly recommend!  It also has a great smell!</li>
    <li> This is the best Tea Tree soap I&#x27;ve tried.  It lathers and has a wonderful lemon scent that is not overpowering.  Leaves your skin feeling smooth and very nice.  Good sized bar of soap that lasts well with minimal melting.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it has enough tea tree oil to actually make a difference in complexion, but smells great. It lathers very well, and leaves you feeling squeaky clean. I recommend it and re-ordered the six pack.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance and leaves skin squeaky clean without dryness. Also seems to have lessened some of the prior dry itchiness of my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Wish it was a little cheaper, but the stuff works great. I even use it as shampoo sometimes. Shipped nice, arrived as expected. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this soap, but the scent is off-putting and I don&#x27;t actually think it&#x27;s very cleansing.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t want to share too much, but i&#x27;ve had a problemsome  skin condition for awhile. The soap gets the job done!  relieves inflammation, and pain. It will be my regular soap,  from now on.  *Also, i liked that it was shipped so fast, and that Amazon   offers it in bulk, for a great price.</li>
    <li> I have ordered about 12 of these bars of soap.  I am actually as of this morning wrapping some for my sister for her upcoming birthday present.  She swears they keep mosquitos and knats away  during the summer months...so, easy to please her!!!!  I, however; use it because I love the scent and the lather.  It makes my bathroom  smell so good.</li>
    <li> While these bars are pricey, they are big and last a while. They don&#x27;t leave any residue. And the tea tree oil helps with skin clarity and health.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance and it is very good on my skin.</li>
    <li> Soap smells very refreshing. Only used a couple of times but I will most likely use on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> This soap makes me feel really clean and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other soaps. It smells amazing. I love it!</li>
    <li> Nice smell. Lasts long. Does lather very nice. As far as the effectiveness on skin, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to gauge. Maybe in a few months, I&#x27;ll update this review.</li>
    <li> Love this soap for the mild fragrance and using a Tea Tree Oil product has put the deodorant soaps out of the shower and house!  It is hard milled and lasts a very long time.  It is a nice large bar!  And it does make a suds, just not like the soaps with the bubbling agents.</li>
    <li> This soap is great! Amazing aroma aside, this leaves your hands feeling moisturized and feeling fresh!</li>
    <li> I have been buying this for my family for a few years. Smells great, lathers well and rinses clean!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products. I also tried other varieties of the Nubian soap and liked them all. Lemongrass has a stronger fragrance than others, if it bothers anyone, but it tones down in few days in the open air.</li>
    <li> Smells heavenly, low lathering, easy rinsing. People using my bathroom want to know what it is. Also lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Best soap for skin and affordable price from Amazon</li>
    <li> Very nice i iwll buy it again.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Great essences of lemon. Cleans very well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nubian Heritage for 5 years now but I don&#x27;t like change. I have been using the black soap and decided to try this one. I usually don&#x27;t like lemongrass, at times it can be very overbearing but this soap has a lovely clean scent. I love this soap very fresh and clean scent.</li>
    <li> Compared to the other soap I bought (Australian Lemon Soap) this Nubian Lemongrass is not good. I went back to buy the Australian Lemon Soap. The smell is good with this soap but the lemon smell does not last as long. The Nubian does have bits in the soap that helps exfoliate but I don&#x27;t like the soap in comparison with the other soap. You might like it. Its about preference. So it won&#x27;t kill to buy it and try it but I won&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> refreshing smell.  great sellers as well.</li>
    <li> This brand of tea tree oil soap is the only one I purchase.  I have oily skin, large pores and occasional body acne.  Other brands of tea tree oil soap have decreased or eliminated the acne but have then left my skin overly dry and flaky.  The Nubian Heritage soap provides the benefit without the dryness and flakiness.  The soap lathers up nicely and lasts fairly well.  It smells like mosquito repellent but that is true of all tea tree oil soaps and the smell does not linger after you shower.  Also, my husband loves the soap too.</li>
    <li> My friends back is prone to break outs. Where other chemical commercial products failed, this product completely cleared it up! Gone forever!</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap because I have eczema and sensitive skin. I wanted to get something that would keep my skin fresh and fight some of the small infections that sometimes develop. Although not perfect, it does work and it smells wonderful. Yet it doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like a lemon either. Smooth like lemon buttercream. Lather up and work it onto the skin. I highly recommend this soap for those with skin problems or anyone!</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  It leaves my skin so soft.  We are testing it this week to see if the Lemongrass and Tea tree oil help keep bugs away on a trip to Thailand.  It did work several years ago with a different brand.  But even if it doesn&#x27;t repel bugs I love the smell and the feel of my skin that I have already ordered more.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap a year ago, and then bought the six pack. I bought this pack a few months ago; I&#x27;m just now moving onto my second bar! This soap lasts a long time, helps with acne scarring, and has worked wonders on my acne-prone, oily skin. This soap brightens complexions as well.</li>
    <li> This soap does a lot as a pore tightener and helps to even tone.  Very pleasant smell and consistency.  However, I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s very drying to the skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because of the reviews of how it cleared up acne. I have used this for over a month now and it is fair. I still have breakouts but it does clean well. It smells nice but I was hoping for more. I probably won&#x27;t order more than this.</li>
    <li> Always a quality product</li>
    <li> My favorite soap!! Love the soap, smells great, and the bars are big. At such a ggod price, (I bought a six pack) and free Prime shipping, it&#x27;s about what we pay for Dove in the supermarket. I love the smell, the lather and the orange peel. I have mild rosacea and the soap did not seem to irritate my problem area.</li>
    <li> We have used these soap bars for the last 2 years. I put them on regular order. Love the way they smell and clean.</li>
    <li> Best soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  Is a good defense against skin fungus which I seem to get from the gym.  It lathers REALLY well.  For stubborn fungus you&#x27;ll need to augment this with an anti fungal cream.  The combination should be effective.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. It dried my skin though.  I love the fresh scent of lemon grass . Love it that it is all natural and plant based.</li>
    <li> The soap makes my skin feel wonderful and cleanl!!!!.I have both my daughters hooked on it. We all use it daily.</li>
    <li> On my second 12 bar order... Will buy this soap forever!!  5 stars all the way!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this soap! I use the lufa gloves with this soap and my skin feels completely refreshed and cleaner than ever. Not to mention that it smells sooooooooooooooo good. I had bought one bar a couple months ago, and decided to get this because it&#x27;s a better deal. It&#x27;s also great to see that they don&#x27;t test on animals and use all natural products.</li>
    <li> I recommend this soap for not only the fresh energizing scent but the quality.  Stayed in a fancy schmanzy hotel once and I finally found the scent of soap they provided!</li>
    <li> I have mild athletes foot that occurs time to time.  So after learning that the tea tree oil is effective on it, I bought these soaps with Nubian Lemongrass &amp; Tea Tree Lotion.  I use the soap to wash my feet and put on the lotion.  It seems to have gotten rid of any signs of athlete&#x27;s foot after using it for about three weeks.  I love it!  I also like the fragrance of both of these products.  I would highly recommend these not only for the athlete&#x27;s foot, but for regular purposes.</li>
    <li> I live and work 6 degrees north of the Equator.  Every day is hot and humid.  I bought the soap to try to combat the skin fungal and bacterial infections that flourish in this sweaty environment and since i have started using the soap i have had fewer and less severe skin issues.  I also like the smell of it.</li>
    <li> This soap does not leave a film on my skin or leave it feeling dry.  Making this a staple.</li>
    <li> Soap is great. I wasn&#x27;t crazy about my wife spending so much money on soap at first but this soap last longer than normal soap. It also lathers up pretty quickly. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> hello; this soap is the best. clean feeling skin,great scent. would reccomend . thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the soaps from Nubian, and this one of Lemongrass and Tea Tree is by far my favorite.  If you feel you must try another scent, at least get one of these because I am sure this will become your favorite as well.</li>
    <li> I must say, this soap is one of the best I have ever tried. With its wonderful lemony fragrance and refreshing feel, there is no reason to buy any other soap. It also improved my skin&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;appearance.</li>
    <li> I love the smell.  It works well, but not as well as Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Pure-Castile Soap.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a nice soap that is not ultraexpensive. The fragrance is very pleasant and the soap does not dissolve within days. It has a nice gritty feel and actually gets grittier as it gets smaller.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for  my wife.  She loves the smell and it seems to get her clean, so if she is happy I am happy!!!</li>
    <li> I have dry/sensitive skin and love this soap for my face and body. Smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Feels very gentle and great for all-purpose use.</li>
    <li> Smells good and feels good on the body.  No more crappy fake soaps....get something real people.  Your body will thank you.</li>
    <li> Lovely scent and very kind to the skin.  I love the all natural ingredients, and even though I&#x27;ve only been using it a week, my skin is much softer and not nearly as itchy.  Great product - will be ordering again in the future.</li>
    <li> This has such a smooth feel to it and leaves my skin feeling nice. The scent is lovely and the makes the bathroom smell good.</li>
    <li> I love this soap and buy it again and again. It is so refreshing ! I have to hide my supply because my 35 year old son will use it up if I don&#x27;t .</li>
    <li> This was the first time I tried this soap and I love it.  It smells wonderful and makes my skin feel soft and moisturized. Will definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this soap to every body with dry skin. I use it for my shower, I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great soap, I have sensitive skin and this soap really helps keep it clear and smooth. Smells amazing too.</li>
    <li> Lovely soap. Quick delivery. Good price.</li>
    <li> This is my summer soap!!! Smells great and perfect for sensitive skin.  Product arrived on time too</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness this soap rocks. This soap lathers so nice and the smell is very nice.</li>
    <li> Great scent, long lasting soap, invigorating.</li>
    <li> I originally ordered this soap because my disabled husband was having a lot of skin issues, especially on his back due to the moisture build up because he lays in one place for extended periods.  I had used several other things, trying to avoid prescription meds.  Once we started using this soap, there was a tremendous difference, and I love the smell so much it is now what I use.  I have had far less issues with dry skin this summer, and will keep on using it.</li>
    <li> The best anti-fungal soap I have used. Doesn&#x27;t have a hard drying effect, rinses nice and clean, has a good surfactant quality, and will not cake, mar, or deteriorate. Great scent, and even has little chunks of fiber in it that aid in a gentle scrub. Works good on the whole body, including the face, and doesn&#x27;t scum up the tub.</li>
    <li> very pleased with products and excellent service</li>
    <li> This is my second order for what has become my favorite shower soap. Has the stuff I like in it. Smells good. Lathers well. Use as shampoo, shaving aid, and general body soap. Holds its shape.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping! Great service! Very nice product . Make your skin feel clean ,good smell and relax.</li>
    <li> The soap works extremely well, I love it.</li>
    <li> I really love this product, as you you guys promised it came thru and working well. Thanks</li>
    <li> This soap smells great.  I think it smells like lemon Pez candy.  I like it because it&#x27;s a solid bar.  I don&#x27;t like soft soap that is mushy.  It lathers nicely and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out.  I have sensitive skin and it works well for me.</li>
    <li> Works well for its intended use. My only issue is the gritty chuncks imbedded in the soap/bar but I guess that may be needed to work its magic. Ive been using it to treat acne and it seems to do the job pretty good.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t aggravate my migraines. Arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> This soap is awesome!  I am sensitive to various soaps and I can use this without any breakouts.  The added bonus is that my husband likes this soap too :D</li>
    <li> Great soap! The entire family uses it! Love the smell too!</li>
    <li> The best soap ever. It gets rid of pimples and blackheads. Its a natural astringent so if you have sensitive skin this soap will burn. Otherwise great.</li>
    <li> Nice soap - I have oily skin and I can use this anywhere and don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking out. It also helps with the ingrown hairs I get and makes my skin soft.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this soap by my sister. I love the way this soap makes my skin feel. I did not itch after taking a bath, and it&#x27;s mild enough to use on my face. Very good I will order from this distributer again.</li>
    <li> When I get home from my MMA gym I suds this up from head to toe and stand in the shower for a minute to let it sit on my skin (including my face, although I rinse my crotch early because it is a little irritating for a girl) and then I rinse it thoroughly so it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  I am at the gym 6 days a week and I do jiu jitsu so I have a high risk of dermal infections.  This soap, because it contains tea tree (which is antimicrobial) is excellent.  The only time I got ringworm was when I stopped using this for a couple months because I ran out.  This soap deserves a 6 star rating! I have been using it for two years now.</li>
    <li> I was looking for lemongrass soap at a reasonable cost and had $3/bar as a target going in. I found this product which hit that price point exactly. They were shipped quickly and one bar has lasted over a month for both me &amp; my wife as they are a very good size. Smells great, lasts a long time, good price point. Will definitely buy again when this supply runs out.</li>
    <li> Bought this soap for the summer...lemongrass and tea tree are known mosquito repellants. Along with some lemon shampoo my daughters had no bug bites this summer! Thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> This is my only bath soap now.This soap makes my skin feel cleaner than any soap I&#x27;ve used in the past.I don&#x27;t use underarm doederant any more.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping happy with product</li>
    <li> Product as described - Fast Shipping - Very Satisfied!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. This is the third time I order and it fantastic. Arrived on time. Each bar is in it&#x27;s own box so storage is easy and clean. Definatly qould bye again</li>
    <li> Excellent cleansing properties with a very pleasant fragrance. Tea Tree Soap has anti-bacterial, anti-viral and anti-fungal benefits and the Lemongrass is very gentle and soothing to the skin.</li>
    <li> I have ordered these from you before, and I Loved it, the bas lastes a long time, not to good on the smell, but then the lemongrass smells comes out later, I just recently ordered again from you, thank you. Snook</li>
    <li> I started using this 2 days ago. The very 1st time I could feel a difference in my skin! It feels so clean and reduces oil. The soap has a citrus smell, but it does not linger on your skin afterward. I bought it because of the tea tree oil in hopes that it can clear up tinea versicolor. So far it seems to be working. Otherwise its a great product- and if it clears up the condition then it will be 7/5!!</li>
    <li> Smells like lemon cookies and left my skin super soft!</li>
    <li> This soap has lasted longer than any soap bar I have ever purchased in any store in the New York City area. I ordered this product in November 2014 and it is now February 2015. One bar in the face sink holder has lasted me for almost three months. Wow!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Well, okay, I do but since Aleppo soap is hard to come by these days I will stick with the Nubian Lemongrass &amp; Tea Tree soap. It smells good, is 100% natural and really good for your skin. I sometimes use it for a foot soak too for a luxurious treat for my feet. I gave my college student daughter a bar and she ordered a whole pack for herself. She loves it too!</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to other more standard soaps. It works as described and we use this soap consistently now.</li>
    <li> This soap has little to no smell at all. It&#x27;s very mild but, super moisturizing. It has great lather and you actually feel clean after using it; no residue is noticed like with some other soaps. I can really tell a difference with my skin. This will be on auto-buy.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, combined with tea tree oil, daily use of this soap &amp; the Nubian Lemongrass &amp; tea tree lotion it has helped me with my skin condition greatly.  Buying more now.</li>
    <li> I purchased Nubian&#x27;s Lemongrass and Tea Tree Soap with the hopes of it addressing some problem acne, but it hasn&#x27;t had any better success than other products. I can say that I like the soap generally, though - doesn&#x27;t get too soft when exposed to water and it has a great citrus-y fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great smell and great product. I buy this stuff all the time and would recommend it to anyone that doesn&#x27;t like commercial products.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Has a very fragrant and organic smell.</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  I looked at it because it has Tea Tree in it and chose it because another reviewer said the smell was strong.  The scent is primarily Lemongrass, and yes, you can smell it when using it but I really like that.  I personally think its a fresh and clean smell.  Also, it&#x27;s an exfoliating soap which was a nice surprise.  I&#x27;m so glad I went ahead and bought the 6 pack.</li>
    <li> very nice product!!!!</li>
    <li> THE SMELL IS VERY IRRITATING.  I DO NOT HAVE AN ADDITIONAL FIFTEEN WORKS TO ADD.  OOOOO OOOOO POP PPP PP PPPP</li>
    <li> The smell is quite potent. I like the lemon grass!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!  Love this soap!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased the soap individually by the bar. I was so impressed that a bought this 6-pack. First about the soap I was told that lemongrass was good for repelling mosquitoes so that was the reason I first purchased and then upon using the soap I was so surprised of the wonderful citrusy scent that was left on my skin. The bar lathers very well and frothy. It&#x27;s like being in a spa with the aroma and my skin feels so smooth and silky afterwards. I honestly believe it has changed the texture of my arms and legs. I highly recommend the 6-pack because it lasts a long time and I&#x27;ve had it over 4 months now with showering with it every day. Great savings and deal.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap and continually reorder. Nice smelling and good lather.</li>
    <li> The product smelled wonderful. I have only just begun using it but I really like how my face feels after using it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what is in this soap bar of magic but it&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;ve suffered from serious acne after stopping hormonal birth control and I have tried everything under the sun to fix it. I came across this soap at my grocery store when looking for something cruelty free and liked the reviews on amazon so I got it. I had acne scars and current acne that after a week of using this soap is completely cleared. This stuff is amazing! If I see a Pimple starting to pop up, I&#x27;ll put a dab of the soap on it like a spot treatment and it clears it right up! The smell is very light and fresh. I&#x27;m most amazed by how it healed my acne scars though, it&#x27;s like I have a completely new face. Just fabulous!</li>
    <li> Nice lathering, refreshing fragrance but left my skin itchy with a rash on my neck. I know I have sensitive skin, so still 3 stars because my daughter used it with no problem at all.</li>
    <li> Smells great and helps with tinea versicolor! It also lasts a long time. It&#x27;s great that it comes in packs of 6</li>
    <li> great soap I enjoy it.</li>
    <li> First off, this soap is very well made and does have many benefits.  If you have mild acne prone skin and you want to avoid all the crap chemicals out there, this is a great choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said it&#x27;s not a cure-all soap.  If you have anything serious I doubt this will do much for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way you can&#x27;t lose with this stuff.  I never used to buy &#x27;expensive&#x27; bar soaps and got crap that every store carries, but now I will never buy &#x27;cheap&#x27; soaps ever again.</li>
    <li> If you want clean, with no oily skin feeling,  this is the product to get.  Cleans, leaves you feeling fresh and refreshed at the same time.  It does what soap is supposed to do, cleans your skin, not a harsh clean, but with refreshing scent making Your Day a whole lot brighter.  This soap makes the before and after test on your skin so outrageously easy that even if you have used something else for a while, you will be shocked by how great your skin feels after a wash with Nubian.  I promise!</li>
    <li> I finally ran through my final bar of Nubian Lemongrass and Tea Tree soap - the last of 6 I received in this pack - and will be ordering more soon. This is my favorite soap by Nubian Heritage out of 5 I have tried, so I had to load up with this bulk pack in mid-November. The 6 bars lasted me for over 6 months, so they certainly last. They do not, however, do anything to combat acne for *my skin.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everybody&#x27;s skin is different, so this soap may help somebody else to either get rid of or manage acne. For me, it did not. At the same time, my body acne did not get any worse when using this soap. So, it was a wash (pun intended!), yet I still love this soap bar because of its texture, its smell, and its natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, lasts a while, has a nice lather, smells great (if you like lemons), and just feels great. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  I have a chronic outbreak of ringworm.  Yuck I know.  But this stuff works to keep it at bay.  It is very mild.  I have tried other tea tree soaps and oils for its antibiotic properties and this works the best.  Also, you can&#x27;t beat this price.  Trust me.  I have shopped it at other online and in-store places.  The lowest I have found per bar is $3 at Amazon and $3.99 to $5.99 elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Soap works really good, keeps my skin smooth</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve even used this on my hair. It works great for my skin in the shower and it&#x27;s the ONLY soap I use in the shower. I make sure to keep stocked up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the other scents, but since the lemongrass &amp; tea tree smells good, I keep to it.</li>
    <li> i have enjoyed all the nubian soaps i have tried so far and this is no exception- plenty of lather, great scent, and rinses clean. no overdrying my skin and it works great for my scalp also. unlike the black soap it doesn&#x27;t leave residue in the shower. this could be the last stop for searching for a permanent soap, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> Nubian Lemongrass and Tea Tree Soap  is a really good soap. It helps to dry up pimples fast and washes away every trace of makeup really well.&lt;br /&gt;I usually soap it on and leave it in place for about a minute or until it dries...on problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;It also lathers/suds up nicely and leave a refreshing/clean smell behind.&lt;br /&gt;However, because it feels so good against your skin you may be tempted to over wash your face and make it really dry as a result.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Moisturize well after use, to prevent dryness (also soaping up once or twice should be enough).</li>
    <li> This soap is fantastic. The smell is a little strong right out of the box but don&#x27;t let that deter you from giving it a try. Long lasting moisture. I don&#x27;t have any major skin problems other than dry skin. This soap helps remedy that but it won&#x27;t replace a good lotion for your skin type. There is an exfoliant aspect to this which has helped with dry/dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent price and it arrived very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Best soap for problem skin.  The aroma from the lemongrass and the orange peel is really good.</li>
    <li> This has very quickly become my favorite soap! I have very sensitive skin and many other products were leading to breakouts under my arms and in the groin area, this soap not only leaves me feeling clean and moisturized but has substantially cut down on breakouts I had been having! Even works great as a face cleanser before using other exfoliating products! I love this stuff great product! 5 ****&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I love the soap.  It cleans well and I love the smell; its fresh.</li>
    <li> This soap has a pleasant smell and very much refreshing.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other soaps.  I like it so much, that I ordered it three times already!  The price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> This soap is great! I think it&#x27;s the best soap I have ever used. It lathers great, smells wonderful and it seems to be helping a rash that I have had for years. I will be ordering more for sure!</li>
    <li> If you are having skin problem, either itching or pimples, lather on this soap, wait 3 minutes or until the soap start drying on your body, then just rinse off, and apply a generous amount of your favorite lotion.</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering this soap and I will be ordering more in the future.  I normally suffer with itchy dry skin, but since using this soap, my skin has just about cleared up. The shipping timing was perfect and again, great product.</li>
    <li> This soap is everything it is made out to be.  I would highly recommend it for anybody who&#x27;s looking for a high quality shower soap.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap but better than that is the fact that it is chemical free and leaves your skin nice and clean without leaving it dry.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a family member with Tinea Versicolor.  It didn&#x27;t seem to help.  But my family has liked the soap.  It has a nice feel and smell.  I find it a bit drying.  By the way, castor oil and coconut oil mixed did seem to cure the tinea versicolor.</li>
    <li> This was the best discovery ever....I love the way my skin feels afterward. I highly recommend it! and it&#x27;s price right.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Really nice soap, would recommend</li>
    <li> I use it for my acne it help keep my face clear.  I use it in the morning and the evening.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It smells great and leaves my skin feeling soft. It suds up well enough to use for shaving, if needed. It lasts in the shower without getting weird and soft. It is also nice to think that teatree is good for keeping skin bacteria and fungus at bay; although, I don&#x27;t know of any evidence.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been trying different soap, but this only working for my husband allergy issue. So far he does not have  any problem. No itching, scratching. We are even recommended this product to family and friends.</li>
    <li> Nubian Products are wonderful and natural!</li>
    <li> I love this soap. I add few drops of the therapeutic grade Eucalyptus radiata Essential OIl ( mix with dry salt first )&lt;br /&gt;before  add  to bath water.&lt;br /&gt;I feel to combine the Tea Tree ingredient from the soap  with Eucalyptus they can increase the antibacterial&lt;br /&gt;and antiviral as well as an anti-inflammatory level, I soak for approx 20 minutes while practice deep breathing.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is great !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was infected with HA-MRSA ( super bug ) early this year from knee surgery at hospital.&lt;br /&gt;I was successfully treated with 6 weeks of antibiotic IV injection.  Today I am seeking for natural ways to maintain&lt;br /&gt;my health and to boost up immune system.</li>
    <li> My second order for the soap.  Will continue to purchase it as long as it&#x27;s available. Great scent!</li>
    <li> Top notch!  Period end of story.</li>
    <li> This creamy lathering, citrusy smelling soap is refreshing and cleans well.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a good soap that lathers and makes your skin soft, this is what you need.. I have never had a soap that lathers so well and gets your skin so clean... It gets squeaky clean and leaves your skin soft.. I also use the Coconut Papaya lotion and the two together and wonderful, I Recommend using their products together for the best results....</li>
    <li> Wanted to try something natural the way it should be as opposed to heavily perfumed bar soaps with lord knows what chemicals in them and wow...loving these bars and their aroma. Never will go back to &amp;#34;deodorant soaps&amp;#34; and their funky additives again. Everything we need is right here provided by who??? Mother Nature...the way it should be! Leaves you feeling exceptionally clean, relaxed and skin is nice and smooth. No itching or dryness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d purchased this soap in the past and really liked it, but this time (I don&#x27;t know if the product has changed in strength) it was so strong that my mom and I both had skin irritations under our arms afterward. I won&#x27;t go into great detail, but it was bad enough that I will not be using the remaining 5 bars in the 6 pack. First one went in the trash after it affected us that way, and now I simply don&#x27;t know what to do with the rest. Very sad about this, as I was looking forward to enjoying this soap again. Kind of bummed I wasted the money.</li>
    <li> We always have this product in the house for hubby, who needs a strong grease cutting soap.  I do not use it because it is too drying for my delicate skin.</li>
    <li> Husband has developed a side effect to meds that cause huge acne sores on his back and chest, and this has really helped to clear them up, without making his skin dry and tight.  Will definitely keep this around as long as we have any acne problems in our household.</li>
    <li> Love this soap! Thanks for such a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> As someone who needs a hypoallergenic soap this product is perfect for me as well as the rest of my family.  It is inexpensive but looks, smells and works like more expensive brands.  I love the smell of Lemongrass, and the Tea Tree Oil works as an astringent to make your skin feel very fresh and clean.  It is anti-bacterial and also contains Shea Butter to moisturize your skin.  The Orange Peel works as an exfoliant, increasing circulation as well as possessing anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price it is worth a try and I believe you will be hooked on it after that.  It comes in a six pack and the density of the soap makes it last much longer than regular brands you find in the market or even speciality stores.  I can&#x27;t say a negative thing about it.  I will continue to buy this brand in place of my usual hypoallergenic soap that leaves me clean but without any other benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a list of the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Shea Butter&lt;br /&gt;- Coconut Oil&lt;br /&gt;- Cocoa Butter&lt;br /&gt;- Lemongrass Oil&lt;br /&gt;- Tea Tree Oil&lt;br /&gt;- Vegetable Glycerin&lt;br /&gt;- Orange Peel&lt;br /&gt;- Vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;- Orange Oil&lt;br /&gt;- Vegetable Color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to be a bit sneaky as well as economical you can buy the six pack and give the individual soap as gifts or part of a gift basket.  No one will believe how inexpensive it is.  They will think you bought it at an expensive Bath Shop.</li>
    <li> Great sent and refreshing feeling.  Using it as a facial and body bar.</li>
    <li> The smell of this soap is ok. Thought it would improve the skin better than it actually does. A little overpriced soap.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I&#x27;m in my late 60&#x27;s and have problems with dry skin and mild rashes.  Dry skin: Gone.  Rashes: Gone.  Lathers very well and it&#x27;s not loaded with artificial fragrance; you just smell clean when finished.  Good price mark and arrived quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great soap. I used to use Dove, by my skin would get very dry and itchy. Despite plenty of cocoa butter/ body oils, it wasn&#x27;t working. I now use this bar and the Shea Butter soap. This soap aha a light lemony smell, unisex for sure, and leaves no unnecessary fragrance after washing off. No dryness either. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> It has little rocks in the soap for exfoliation. Lather greats. Gets the job done. Smells nice.</li>
    <li> i enjoy the smell of this soap plus it made the old ways not like soap today which is commecials mixed together. The soap lathers up better the your store bought soap.</li>
    <li> This stuff feels great on the skin and the scent is awesome too. I have a mild staph infection on my shoulders and back and this certainly isn&#x27;t hurting it.</li>
    <li> great product - long lasting soap - smells nice and clean - will order more</li>
    <li> Smells good, makes my skin feel good.</li>
    <li> LOVE this soap! The scent is delicious and invigorating and my skin felt so soft after my shower.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> This is a quality soap with a delightful aroma.  It has a firm quality and lasts a long time.  Reasonable price - sometimes the soaps I like best are very expensive.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this soap a few times and I really enjoy the smell of it.  It also does not dry my skin out.  Lemon and Orange Peel, such a nice smell.</li>
    <li> AMAZING SOAP!  Aids in clearing up acne, smells wonderful</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap along with a Tea tree liquid soap for about 3 months now and have noticed a definite decrease with toenail fungus and warts in my stomach and groin area. I like the tingling freshness it makes your skin feel when using it.</li>
