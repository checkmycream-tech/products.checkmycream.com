      <li>Great purchase for the price - no issues.  </li>

      <li>Great Value.</li>
      <li>My friend had one for years and loved it....</li>
      <li>Gives a good clean cut.</li>
      <li>Glad that wahl decided to put a manual switch tho as thats</li>
      <li>and I really love that it operates on battery</li>
      <li>It cut me up pretty good on my neck.</li>
      <li>GIVES A NICE SMOOTH CLEAN FINISH.  </li>
      <li>EASY TO USE.  </li>
      <li>Easy to handle.</li>
      <li>Need to keep it in something resembling a civilized shape?</li>
      <li>it seems to fully fit the bill.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed about this product was its very cheap plastic design, but for the cost I can get over that.</li>
      <li>If you just plan on using it for minor touchups here and there than it should be good.</li>
      <li>but there was no cutting.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked this trimmer, but the last one I got from Electronic Warehouse Outlet run through batteries about every 3-4 times</li>
      <li>Give you a 5&#x27; o clock and trims those hairs right off.</li>
      <li>He loves it, it does exactly what he wanted.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty no-frills, easy-to-use, and capable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>THANKS AMAZON.</li>
      <li>the teeth are not irritating against the skin.  </li>
      <li>Uses 2 AA batteries and your set and ready to go.</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>I just switched the whole blade assembly with my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty much a really working multipurpose trimmer with multiple settings.  </li>
      <li>turned into more trouble than it was worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Maybe a little loud but its not like you are using it for more than a few minutes at most.</li>
      <li>Looking to stop your beard from becoming an unruly mess?</li>
      <li>dropped this trimmer from five stars to two because I don&#x27;t think I should have to fix a new trimmer before I can use it.</li>
      <li>It appears to have a similar blade as the higher end ones but it grabs and pulls a lot, I also had it lockup on me twice as it must be underpowered</li>
      <li>A battery operated item such as this is much more convenient and can be replaced in less than a minute.</li>
      <li>real advice I have here is that rechargeable trimmers or whatever have a very short life and are always needing to be recharged, which takes wall clock time.</li>
      <li>Cheap, but a complete waste of money.</li>
      <li>It would have been an easy fix, but being a lazy guy</li>
      <li>plan was simply replace the old trimmer with the new one.  </li>
      <li>Not sure Wahl is quite the name it used to be, but if you want a cheap trimmer and don&#x27;t mind the noise, this one does seem to get the job done.</li>
      <li>so I went with the same manufacturer for my new purchase.</li>
      <li>Not as powerful as my previous trimmer.</li>
      <li>The only issues I have with it is that it is a very very loud trimmer..</li>
      <li>Surprised as to how long the batterys lasted.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much and I was still let down.</li>
      <li>If you use the non-filtered setting you could trim it right down to the skin if you weren&#x27;t careful.</li>

    <li> Great purchase for the price - no issues.  Maybe a little loud but its not like you are using it for more than a few minutes at most.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this trimmer, but the last one I got from Electronic Warehouse Outlet run through batteries about every 3-4 times I used it. Last one I had batteries lasted couple months.</li>
    <li> EASY TO USE.  CAM AS PROMISED FOR DELIVERY. MY HUSBAND LOVES IT IS NON ELECTRIC. GIVES A NICE SMOOTH CLEAN FINISH.  THANKS AMAZON. DID IT AGAIN. T/U</li>
    <li> I did not receive this, so I have no idea if it works or not.  Did I get screwed again ????&lt;br /&gt;Terry Ingersoll</li>
    <li> He loves it, it does exactly what he wanted.  He is very happy with the product. There is nothing else to say.</li>
    <li> It does the job and I really love that it operates on battery so there are not so may cords in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I had a similar unit that died after 35 years use so I went with the same manufacturer for my new purchase.</li>
    <li> Looking to stop your beard from becoming an unruly mess? Need to keep it in something resembling a civilized shape? Than this will do it! It&#x27;s pretty no-frills, easy-to-use, and capable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, turns out that cats hate it. Turning it on while a cat is sitting in the bathroom resulted in a flailing furball and numerous scratches. So, y&#x27;know, keep that in mind.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t complain about it. It seems to do its job. I have to admit I&#x27;m very wary of that continuing, since my Wahl personal groomer died after barely more than a month. Not sure Wahl is quite the name it used to be, but if you want a cheap trimmer and don&#x27;t mind the noise, this one does seem to get the job done.</li>
    <li> This is a piece of s*** product. Please stay away from it. Cheap, but a complete waste of money. It worthless.</li>
    <li> it seems to fully fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;only two complaints:&lt;br /&gt;1) a little loud&lt;br /&gt;2) not built to the standards expected of Wahl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only real advice I have here is that rechargeable trimmers or whatever have a very short life and are always needing to be recharged, which takes wall clock time. A battery operated item such as this is much more convenient and can be replaced in less than a minute.</li>
    <li> Surprised as to how long the batterys lasted. Gives a good clean cut. Easy to handle. Would recommend to all.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these Wahl 5537 Mustache and Beard Battery Trimmers at Walmart about twenty years ago and I would still be using it, but a battery corroded and cleaning the contacts turned into more trouble than it was worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My plan was simply replace the old trimmer with the new one.  Unfortunately it appears the new one was assembled by the new guy in the plant.  The motor ran like a champ but there was no cutting.  The two parts of the plastic upper blade had not been snapped together.  It would have been an easy fix, but being a lazy guy I just switched the whole blade assembly with my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dropped this trimmer from five stars to two because I don&#x27;t think I should have to fix a new trimmer before I can use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen some pretty average reviews for something that cost a bit less than $11.  I think this trimmer is excellent for the price.  Once you determine which trim guard to use, you don&#x27;t need to change anything.  Great Value.</li>
    <li> Give you a 5&#x27; o clock and trims those hairs right off. Uses 2 AA batteries and your set and ready to go.</li>
    <li> Trimmer works well no complaints. It comes with multiple adapters for length. The only issues I have with it is that it is a very very loud trimmer..</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get clippers to work</li>
    <li> Going from a wahl 9818 to this one seems to be  a mistake, if you plan on using the trimmer a lot I wouldn&#x27;t get this one. If you just plan on using it for minor touchups here and there than it should be good. It appears to have a similar blade as the higher end ones but it grabs and pulls a lot, I also had it lockup on me twice as it must be underpowered (also could be why its grabby). Glad that wahl decided to put a manual switch tho as thats why I left the 9818, the button would stop turning off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, do not use it without the guards. It cut me up pretty good on my neck.</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as my previous trimmer. Will do in a pinch.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about this product was its very cheap plastic design, but for the cost I can get over that. It was the fact that I&#x27;ve tried 4 sets of batteries and it still won&#x27;t turn on, that upset me. I didn&#x27;t expect much and I was still let down.</li>
    <li> I bought mine on Sept. 2, 2013 and have used it 3 times a week ever since.  The blades are still sharp and I have only replaced the AA batteries once.  It has performed flawlessly.  I can&#x27;t believe some of the complaints.  I&#x27;ve never bought an appliance for under $20 that beats the value of this trimmer. Bravo!</li>
    <li> My friend had one for years and loved it....so I bought this one and its great.  It came with 3 guides and other little accessories.  It does it job well and the teeth are not irritating against the skin.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty much a really working multipurpose trimmer with multiple settings.  If you use the non-filtered setting you could trim it right down to the skin if you weren&#x27;t careful.</li>
