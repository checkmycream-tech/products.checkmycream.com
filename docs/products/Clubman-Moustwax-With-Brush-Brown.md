      <li>Great Product.</li>
      <li>DOES A GREAT JOB.</li>
      <li>Coverage was perfect and application easy.</li>
      <li>You owe me 1 more tube!</li>
      <li>Nice transaction.</li>
      <li>Honestly, if I could give this product zero stars I would because I bought it for one thing</li>

      <li>Washed out easily afterwards with warm water and soap.</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with this mustache wax, I have used it before.</li>
      <li>I kept having to re-adjust after 20 minutes or add more.  </li>
      <li>On top of that, the wax comes off and stains things brown.  </li>
      <li>I like this better.</li>
      <li>and I love the product.</li>
      <li>AND make sure to wash it all out in the shower or it will stain your towels permanently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The more you add the more odd it looks because while it is brown, it&#x27;s not as if it matches many people&#x27;s hair color perfectly.  </li>
      <li>The hold was a huge issue an almost non-existent.</li>
      <li>i found this stuff holds super strong...</li>
      <li>good solid wax, works well</li>
      <li>Fast shipping--need I say more?</li>
      <li>Quick delivery</li>
      <li>but if you wanna look super dapper you can try it out</li>
      <li>This wax is great if you want a quick waxing with average hold.</li>
      <li>Clubman is by far my favorite, i use it in a combination with got2b styling glue</li>
      <li>This is too dark for my grayish mustache but consistency is good.</li>
      <li>AND IT NEVER FAILS TO PLEASE ME.</li>
      <li>Clubman Moustache Wax is exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>I am glad that you have this in different colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Used this product many years ago, but have been unable to find this in stores for many years!  </li>
      <li>The little comb was nice.</li>
      <li>Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t put so much on.</li>
      <li>but i don&#x27;t like that much...</li>
      <li>He likes it as much as I do.</li>
      <li>and it didnt really amaze me</li>
      <li>/&gt;Besides that I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.(CLUBMAN MUSTACHE WAX)</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t live up to the standards.  </li>
      <li>I have used Clubman Clear for years</li>
      <li>so I mix it with the natural which is very creamy white and make a lighter brown.</li>
      <li>Wax was soft with no hold.</li>
      <li>BTW - chicks love a little grey!</li>
      <li>It is a large tube that will go a long way.</li>
      <li>Got exactly what I asked for and it came faster than I expected.</li>
      <li>Other mustache guys I meet are always surprised when I tell them I use clubman, highly recommended but only in combo with got2B!</li>
      <li>I am an old timer - I have been around a long time, and so has this product.</li>

<li> I am an old timer - I have been around a long time, and so has this product.</li>
<li> wish it came in different shades, like dark brown</li>
<li> Product in the tube was old and hard.</li>
<li> and I have tried tons of other waxes.</li>
<li> Now I am getting a little grey in my moustache and the Clubman Brown can be used to take a little of it away.</li>
<li> If you want dark brown its the ticket.</li>
<li> If you have had troubles &amp;#34;tweaking your &#x27;stache&amp;#34; in the past I&#x27;d go with a different product for a really stiff hold.  </li>
<li> I bought some other brand in the little tins and found it to be way to smelly and greasy.</li>
<li> Had to squeeze out half the tube to reach usable product.</li>
<li> There are a lot of reviews about how the hold is stiff as a rock</li>
<li> Wax is hard as a rock</li>
<li> only problem is that if it gets wet it will start to run and drip down your face which looks DISGUSTING.</li>
<li> This is like a brown clay that goes into your mustache and makes it hard as hell!</li>
<li> then the wax dries out and is useless</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Been using this for years.  Makes me look years younger, which the chicks dig.  I hope.</li>
    <li> Great product. Excellent color. Fast shipping--need I say more?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and my only criticism is that I&#x27;ve the experience of having the cap break then the wax dries out and is useless</li>
    <li> Great Product. Coverage was perfect and application easy. Washed out easily afterwards with warm water and soap.</li>
    <li> It is a large tube that will go a long way. I do not know why these guys always label colors inaccurately it is darker brown not lighter. It does the job. This tube should last years. If you want dark brown its the ticket.</li>
    <li> I am an old timer - I have been around a long time, and so has this product. I have used Clubman Clear for years and I love the product. Now I am getting a little grey in my moustache and the Clubman Brown can be used to take a little of it away. BTW - chicks love a little grey!</li>
    <li> A gigt for my son. He likes it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> i bought this stuff before i grew out my handle bars and it didnt really amaze me but once i got it growing i found this stuff holds super strong...but i don&#x27;t like that much...but if you wanna look super dapper you can try it out</li>
    <li> This wax is great if you want a quick waxing with average hold. I find I need to reapply to achieve the look I go for.</li>
    <li> Wax is hard as a rock</li>
    <li> This is not like vaseline or pomade. This is like a brown clay that goes into your mustache and makes it hard as hell! You can hang things off of my mustache!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that if it gets wet it will start to run and drip down your face which looks DISGUSTING. AND make sure to wash it all out in the shower or it will stain your towels permanently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> good solid wax, works well</li>
    <li> Got exactly what I asked for and it came faster than I expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give this 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t turn flakey after awhile.  Otherwise it holds well.  Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t put so much on.</li>
    <li> The hold was a huge issue an almost non-existent. There are a lot of reviews about how the hold is stiff as a rock but I didn&#x27;t find it to be that way.  I kept having to re-adjust after 20 minutes or add more.  The more you add the more odd it looks because while it is brown, it&#x27;s not as if it matches many people&#x27;s hair color perfectly.  On top of that, the wax comes off and stains things brown.  If you have had troubles &amp;#34;tweaking your &#x27;stache&amp;#34; in the past I&#x27;d go with a different product for a really stiff hold.  Honestly, if I could give this product zero stars I would because I bought it for one thing and it didn&#x27;t live up to the standards.  Not even close.</li>
    <li> wish it came in different shades, like dark brown</li>
    <li> This stuff simply rocks and rolls amigos, I&#x27;d check it out if I were you</li>
    <li> Nice transaction. Liked the product</li>
    <li> Wax was soft with no hold. The brown color was not of any color hair I&#x27;ve seen before. The little comb was nice. The seller was spot on no complaints there. Quick delivery</li>
    <li> This is too dark for my grayish mustache but consistency is good. I bought the Chestnut after this and found it to still be too brown so I mix it with the natural which is very creamy white and make a lighter brown. I bought some other brand in the little tins and found it to be way to smelly and greasy. I like this better.</li>
    <li> Used this product many years ago, but have been unable to find this in stores for many years!  It works as I remember--v. well!</li>
    <li> I have had my handlebar mustache for almost 4 years now and I have tried tons of other waxes. Clubman is by far my favorite, i use it in a combination with got2b styling glue and it keeps my stache pliable and in place all day!! Other mustache guys I meet are always surprised when I tell them I use clubman, highly recommended but only in combo with got2B!</li>
    <li> Been using this brand for a quarter century.  Enough said.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with this mustache wax, I have used it before. The only one of this brand I can find in stores is the neutral color. I am glad that you have this in different colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DF</li>
    <li> Clubman Moustache Wax is exactly what I needed. PROBLEM - I ordered 10 tubes, I received 9. You owe me 1 more tube!</li>
    <li> DOES A GREAT JOB. I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS AND IT NEVER FAILS TO PLEASE ME. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.(CLUBMAN MUSTACHE WAX)</li>
    <li> Product in the tube was old and hard. Had to squeeze out half the tube to reach usable product.</li>
