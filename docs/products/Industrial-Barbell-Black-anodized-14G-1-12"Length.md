      <li>It is slightly bigger then my original one, though.</li>
      <li>Highly Recommended</li>
      <li>It is the same quality as you would get at Hot Topic or a tattoo shop.</li>
      <li>I had to finally go to a shop and have a shorter bar put in because this one was causing so much pain.</li>
      <li>It works well once you get that far.</li>

<li> I wish there were a standard size for industrial barbells - I&#x27;ve ordered some that were too short and otheres that were too long.</li>
<li> The bar is too long for my ear.</li>
<li> This took a long time to deliver.</li>
<li> The paint hasn&#x27;t chipped yet and the balls a haven&#x27;t fallen off , although the bar is a little too big</li>
<li> but it does have a little extra</li>
<li> My only complaint is that it took a little effort to unscrew the ball.</li>
<li> I bought this because I lost a ball for my black industrial.</li>
<li> the bar isn&#x27;t really bad either, definitely worth it.</li>
<li> Ive been wearing mine everyday for almost a year.</li>

    <li> Solid. Great metal. No allergic reaction what so ever. Threads up solid. Good stuff</li>
    <li> Got it in a timely manner and it fits fine. I&#x27;ve had it on for about 6 months now, no complaints</li>
    <li> Fits exactly how it claims, and works perfectly. Was having issues because the original one was too big which caused more swelling, but with this it was great. Great price, and looks awesome. Glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> It came in about 3 days after I ordered it when it was supposed to come in like 5. the 14g is perfect for me, but I got too long of a bar, but I don&#x27;t really mind. the bar isn&#x27;t really bad either, definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I lost a ball for my black industrial. It was easier to just replace the whole thing. This is a good quality barbell. It is the same quality as you would get at Hot Topic or a tattoo shop.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this in my ear for about 8 months now and it hasn&#x27;t had any irritation or issues. I wish there were a standard size for industrial barbells - I&#x27;ve ordered some that were too short and otheres that were too long. This was a pretty good fit for me but it does have a little extra so I occasionally catch it when brushing my hair.</li>

    <li> i liked it but the ball came off while i was sleeping a few weeks after i got it ...</li>
    <li> This took a long time to deliver. I felt like I was waiting for it longer then I should have. Besides that, the actual product is high quality and is good as the barbell that I got from my piercing originally. It is slightly bigger then my original one, though. Its about an inch or two longer, which is something to keep in mind if you are planning on purchasing this. Overall, it fits in my ear and I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Great quality and fast shipping!  Highly Recommended</li>

    <li> Love it!!! It doesn&#x27;t turn</li>
    <li> Great price and product.</li>
    <li> 1 star because it is not the size i needed.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive ears and this one works well. It was a good purchase.</li>
