      <li>ok.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also started using when I use my flat iron, it&#x27;s great when I have to grab strands of hair that are overwhelmingly hot.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;ll</li>
      <li>Used it to blow dry my hair straight on the highest setting and my &amp;#34;styling&amp;#34; hand did not get heated at all - more like warm.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;d rather burn my fingers to get a straight piece of hair than to not feel anything when I&#x27;m trying to straighten</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>This glove is exactly what I needed to protect my hand from the high heat of my flat iron.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok it gets a little &#x27;hot&amp;#34; when you touch for so long</li>

      <li>Works as expected, fast shipping</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it needs to do.... only a little bit of heat transfers to my fingers when I use it!</li>

    <li> Worked well for what it does, I wish it is a little thinner so I can have more tactile feel</li>
    <li> The product did not work well on my hand but the service I received was awesome, they gave me my money back and they were very courteous and helpful :) So I&#x27;ll give them a try again some day!</li>
    <li> This glove has been a lifesaver while doing my hair. It fits perfectly on both of my hands, and it isn&#x27;t bulky at all. I&#x27;m able to use my curling rod without any burns!&lt;br /&gt;It works great when your hands need to hold your hair close to the rod. It of course won&#x27;t protect you if you grab your curing iron and hold it in your hand, but it&#x27;s perfect for styling. I&#x27;ve also started using when I use my flat iron, it&#x27;s great when I have to grab strands of hair that are overwhelmingly hot.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;ll definitely be buying a second glove to take with me when I travel.</li>
    <li> Havent tried it.&lt;br /&gt;Look ok.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t say that it is heat proof but it is sufficiently heat dampening that it makes a difference! Used it to blow dry my hair straight on the highest setting and my &amp;#34;styling&amp;#34; hand did not get heated at all - more like warm.</li>
    <li> I really like This glove.</li>
    <li> Works well - kept me from burning my hand again.</li>
    <li> Love it, now i don&#x27;t burn my hand when straightening with my 450 degree straightener.</li>
    <li> Arrived as described. It&#x27;s great that it can be worn on either hand!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok it gets a little &#x27;hot&amp;#34; when you touch for so long but it&#x27;s good.It&#x27;s not magical.</li>
    <li> I need a tutorial on this but it works Great and double gloves are an extra plus</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t feel like this helped any. I can still feel the heat coming through the glove. I&#x27;d rather burn my fingers to get a straight piece of hair than to not feel anything when I&#x27;m trying to straighten</li>
    <li> Not functional , not what I expected.. Gloves usually come in a pair, not this. Terrible quality</li>
    <li> CONS&lt;br /&gt;seemed like a thin winter glove that you put on a child.  gets hot fast, eventually burns&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;keeps hand from direct/immediate tool burns</li>
    <li> I bought this based on all the reviews I read.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t really block the heat that much.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ok but not what I expected.</li>
    <li> Perfect for protecting from burns!</li>
    <li> This glove gets the job done. It protects my hands from burns while I stile my short hair :)</li>
    <li> Works as expected, fast shipping</li>
    <li> works great to protect hands with hot rollesr or a curling iron. I bought two so I can use both hands to wrap hot rollers.</li>
    <li> This glove is exactly what I needed to protect my hand from the high heat of my flat iron. Please note:  You cannot expect to hold the blazing hot flat iron or curling iron for a long period of time. All I need is about 10 to 12 seconds with each section of hair. This glove protects me from getting burned and does the job well.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it needs to do.... only a little bit of heat transfers to my fingers when I use it!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and shipped quickly. :)</li>
