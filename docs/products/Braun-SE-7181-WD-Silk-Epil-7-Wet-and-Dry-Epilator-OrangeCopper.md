<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This epilator works really well. It takes at least a week for my hair to grow back. I am nearsighted and have trouble shaving in the shower because I can&#x27;t see well enough to tell if I got everything. With the Epil 7, I can use it after my shower with my glasses on and make sure I get every hair.</li>
    <li> When it was working it was working very well. But after 7 months, the epilator stopped working. I would recharged it then it will work for few minutes and then it was dead.</li>
    <li> I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to hurt because I tweeze and gotten waxed before, but I was so wrong. But you get used to the pain after a while. Also found out it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much when you shave and then epilate the small hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;I got this product because when I shave, tweeze, wax, whatever, I always get razor burns and little red bumps on my legs which later scar. Because of this, I can never can wear shorts, skirts, short dresses because my legs never look good. Using this epilator has improved the burn. I still get it but not as much as I used to. Just waiting for the scars to heal, but that always takes months, sometimes a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;You have to try different directions, angles, and speeds to get all the hairs. Even then, you might have to shave or tweeze a few hairs it missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ugly:&lt;br /&gt;Only problem has been recent, which at certain angles my skin gets sucked in when trying to epilate armpits. It doesn&#x27;t hurt and the epilator stops running when it happens, but it&#x27;s annoying.</li>
    <li> It is unfortunate, but this $80 device had only lasted for eight months and stopped working. I took good care of it, cleaned it out and never let it overheat.</li>
    <li> I like the design but it does not do the job! My privies &amp;#34;Broun Silk Epil&amp;#34; I was using for more then 10 years did very good job. The old model was pulling the hear.The new model  is cutting the hear. It is mean i have to use new model every 8 days instead of 25 days my old one.  The good thing about new model it not so painful like old one</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m was a habitual shaver by default.  I&#x27;ve tried all forms of wax from home versions to professional and every form of cream.  All have left me disappointed and still with leg hair.  Now I will admit that I have some thick and dark hair on parts of my legs that can only be removed by shaving.  I hate razors because it&#x27;s expensive and full of nicks, oops&#x27;s and patches missed.  I thought I would give an epilator a shot since it was the only thing I haven&#x27;t tried.  I&#x27;m happy I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device itself is awesome.  The size is comfortable to handle and doesn&#x27;t cramp your hand when used for long periods.  There are 3 speeds: off, slow and fast.  I like the fast setting just because you get the maximum hair pulling in the shortest time.  It&#x27;s a bit intense the first time you try it, but you&#x27;ll quickly adjust.  It&#x27;s easy to maneuver between speeds and I wouldn&#x27;t modify it at all.  There is an intensely bright light above the speed settings.  It could be used as a mini flashlight if need be.  It makes it easy to see missed areas, short or baby soft hair.  Not sure what I&#x27;m going to do when it stops working.  The massage attachment is ok for beginning.  It feels ok, but it doesn&#x27;t get close enough to pull out those super short hairs.  The non-massaging attachment is my best friend because it gets those barely there hairs.  Both are easy to clean with the given brush and with water.  The actual tweezing barrel can be a pain to clean with the brush so I just run it under water.  The charging/low battery lights are in a good place and are easy to interpret.  Give it plenty of time to charge the first time and charge it after each use or 40 minutes before the next use.  It&#x27;s battery life isn&#x27;t outstanding, but it gets the job done.  I&#x27;m not mad at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite everything that&#x27;s awesome about it, the noise it makes is deafening.  It&#x27;s a very loud device and while you get used to the noise, others might not.  Be mindful on who&#x27;s in the room or home when you useit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be honest - it hurts, but not in a &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll never do it again&amp;#34; kind of way.  It&#x27;s a strange sensation.  On thick hair it hurts a lot and I ice my legs or underarms to numb the area.  It&#x27;s rather fast and satisfying to see those thick hairs hit the road.  However, you&#x27;ll never know how much baby hair you have until you clean the epilator.  Those little fine hairs can take time to remove (it hurts much less, too!), so plan accordingly.  If I can&#x27;t do it in one day because of time, I&#x27;ll do it over the course of a two days.  If I can manage to do everything in one day, it feels like I&#x27;m getting tattoos all over again.  Just irritating pain that feels like baby needles.  Sounds painful and scary, but it&#x27;s really not.  It&#x27;s just mind over matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use it the first time expect general irritation and redness.  Try it before bed just to give the unhappiness time to settle down.  After that initial use, the irritation is minimal to non existent.  Invest in a good lotion, exfoliant and emergency ingrown hair remedy.  AmLactin is great for bumps and helps out on all three fronts.  I hand make my scrubs to help things along as well.  If I get an ingrown hair (it happens sometimes despite all the prevention) I use Prid salve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not longer a slave to shaving and now it&#x27;s 2 weeks before I consider my next hair removal session.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> As a regular shaver, this was my first experience using an epilator. I was excited to try the Silk Epil 7 since I&#x27;m a mom of a busy toddler and would love to be able to cut showers shorter. I was also drawn to the convenience of being able to shave wet or dry.    I was relieved that the process was less painful than I expected. Pain level and tolerance varies by individual, but for me it was reasonable given that the goal is to pull hair out by the roots. From the first I was able to do both legs dry with no problem. When I got brave and did a test on underarms I found that to be too painful. I&#x27;ll stick with shaving underarms and other tender areas. I was also pleased that in a reasonable period of time the Silk Epil 7 did a good job of removing hair. My legs looked hairless, but didn&#x27;t feel quite silky smooth. Every once in a while there seemed to a hair just long enough to feel but barely too short to remove. Nonetheless, I was satisfied.    There&#x27;s a lot to like about this epilator. The light helps make sure you&#x27;re getting all the hairs with fewer passes. The massaging head is a nice touch, although I couldn&#x27;t tell a large difference over the plain white head that&#x27;s also included. The wipes are nice, but I&#x27;d be willing to continue using the epilator without buying more. There are also two speeds depending on your preference of being faster or gentler. While I could live without most of the features, they are nice. The massaging head, speed settings or wipes might make the difference for someone who&#x27;s more on the fence about tolerating the pain of epilation.    I did pinch myself using the unit once. I was using high speed, the plain head and perhaps applying a bit too much pressure while trying to get the last few hairs from my knees. It was painful (even compared to purposefully yanking your hair out!) and left a mark but didn&#x27;t create a major injury or hurt for long. It&#x27;s made me more cautious about applying too much pressure over uneven areas, but hasn&#x27;t keptme from wanting to use it again.    Another issue is that my legs were smooth for about a week after the first use, and then I noticed regrowth. Because it was about ¼ of the number of hairs I normally have, I assume those simply weren&#x27;t grown in when I did the initial epilation. But of course if you go back and epilate those then you continue to have staggered hair growth. My guess is the solution is to make sure you&#x27;ve waited long enough since shaving so that all hairs are long enough to be plucked. I realize that this is probably an issue with epilation in general versus the Silk Epil 7 specifically, but something to think about if you&#x27;re considering trying it.    Update: I&#x27;ve tried this a few more times after waiting between epilating (went back to shaving for awhile, then waited for it hair to get long enough.) Again, my legs were smooth but I had a crop of hair grow in within the week. It was sparse but enough to need to shave. If I need to shave again within days, why use an epilator?  I&#x27;m not sure if this problem is universal, and it probably has nothing to do with this particular model, but I don&#x27;t find it worth the time and pain.</li>
    <li> Only good if u use on legs onlys.. First time when I use it may it was really painful but second and third time it gets less and less painful. Product may be good if u frequently uses and for people who have thin and fine hairs, but mines are too thick and after using it first time result was good but, It removes hair and skin at the Same time when my new hair started to grow, they grow in side my skin which is horrible.</li>
    <li> i used to epilate a few years ago, but stopped when i lost my device.  i had bought mine at german superstore; i think using one is more common there.&lt;br /&gt;i hadnt shaved for almost a week when i first used this.  this epilator arrived charged enough to almost finish one leg (there is a little light in the handle that tells you to recharge).  and yes, it does hurt, but it is a temporary burning sensation.  because hair has a grow/rest cycle, ive used it every few days since first use, and am very pleased with the overall smoothness and decrease in pain.  the hair that is growing out isnt stubby like with shaving.  i havent used it wet, but i like that i can rinse it off when i am done using it.  and i really like having the light on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps: i used the wipes with first use, and couldnt tell a difference.  also, i have some white heads now up and down my legs and on my bikini line, but this is normal from when i used to do it.</li>
    <li> Works great so far, been using it for a few months now.  I love the flexible head and especially the light because it allows you to see the really small fine hairs you might otherwise overlook.  This is my second Braun Epilator and I have had much success with both of them.</li>
    <li> Having tried waxing, sugar waxing, professional waxing, shaving, and creams, I can say the Braun Silk Epilator works much better for longer term hair removal. It does hurt some. I sometimes spray lidocaine in advance.  The pain does get better with time.  I tried this on two body parts:  Legs  I used initially on unshaved legs. It worked pretty well. I then followed the instructions and used several days after shaving legs. It worked better. After three uses, I had smooth, hairless legs for at least a month.  Bikini area  To be clear, I do not own the part that is to be used for this area. However, in preparation for vacation, I trimmed and used the Braun every-other-day two or three times on exposed parts, and it did keep me bathing suit ready on vacation. I was able to casually shave the area for maintenance, and felt much more confident and looked much less stubbly than when shaving only.  I was very pleased with this epilator. If you realize that hairs grow in cycles and don&#x27;t expect complete smoothness after one use, you&#x27;ll be satisfied. Having said that, I felt okay with the hair removal even after one use. The epilator is easy to clean and charge.</li>
    <li> I rarely take time to write review, but I use them a lot. finding a good eletric epilator was a challenge to me, so I decided that if that review can help other I should probably go on with it.&lt;br /&gt;I struggled hard time to find a good epilator, I&#x27;m from Europe and always used electric epilator but it wasn&#x27;t an easy task to find a good product when I arrived in the US (due to voltage differences I couldn&#x27;t use my previous one here).&lt;br /&gt;I bought a 1st epilator (different brand) but I didn&#x27;t feel like it was really efficient and it stopped working very fast.&lt;br /&gt;I have this Braun model since few month now and I love it, it&#x27;s efficient, does not hurt (that&#x27;s assuming you used electric epilator previously but to me this one is pretty smooth), easy to clean since you can take the whole head apart (really important to me) and I eventhough the little ligth was a useless detail to me when I bought it, I grow to like it, makes it easier to not miss any spot.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitly recommend that product.</li>
    <li> This is my second epilator and I am VERY pleased with it. My previous one was also Braun (not sure about the model but it was new at around 2005) and worked quite well but Silk Epil 7 is so much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The features that I really like are:&lt;br /&gt;1. Flexible head, which makes epilation so much easier, especially in curvy areas like knees, underarms etc.&lt;br /&gt;2. The light on the Silk Epil 7 allow to epilate even when there is no direct light on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s very convenient to have the adopter for charging instead of the power cable because you can simply epilate anywhere and don&#x27;t have to sit near a power source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other improvement on my previous epilator is that I don&#x27;t have to go over and over the same area to remove the hairs. Once or twice is enough for Silk Epil 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*For new epilator users*&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that most of the negative comments where from first time users who experienced pain and therefore weren&#x27;t pleased with the product. Well, this product, just like any epilator, is designed to remove hairs, a process that by nature can&#x27;t be painless. It has nothing to do with how many kids you gave birth to or how many tattoos you have, if you&#x27;re not used to removing hair either with an epilator or by waxing, it&#x27;s gonna hurt until you get used to it. The same applies if you only removed hairs from your legs and try to epilate or wax underarms, it&#x27;s gonna hurt the first few times until you get used to it. Give it some time and you might find the product quite satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*For those considering the more expensive package*&lt;br /&gt;Braun say that this model is for legs only but I think it works great underarms and in the bikini area thanks to the flexible head. I&#x27;m sure it will work just fine on arms as well. If you want a product that epilates (but doesn&#x27;t shave or trim) and you don&#x27;t epilate your face, this cheaper model will be just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at what the more expensive sets offer and I simply can&#x27;t see how they justify the extra $$$ unless you want \\&quot;all in one\\&quot; kind of product. *Shaver head - if you want to shave you don&#x27;t buy an epilator or you simply buy a razor as well, much cheaper. *Trimmer cap - if you trim you probably already have the right tool for that. *Sensitive area head - as mentioned before, the standard head is just fine. *Facial head - if you epilate your face, especially above the lip, you will probably need this attachment.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this gadget. Easy to use. Does everything it says it will do. As a consumer that&#x27;s all you want!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good I have it for almost maybe 1 year  or more and it&#x27;s so good I&#x27;m very happy with it I highly recommended .</li>
    <li> Before the Braun Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 7, I&#x27;d never used an epilator.  That said, I have waxed (only a few times; hated it), and I pluck my eyebrows regularly -- so I&#x27;m no stranger to removing hair by the root.  So far I&#x27;ve used the Silk-&amp;eacute;pil twice on my legs, and I have to say that I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What comes in the package: The epilator, two caps, a charger, a cinch pouch, a small flat cleaning brush, and a package of 16 Olay pre-epilation wipes.  The epilator is cordless and has a rechargeable Li-ion battery, and it&#x27;s totally waterproof -- so you can use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing you can&#x27;t see on the stock photo or the packaging is that a large portion of the epilator is glittery, underneath a smooth plastic coating.  I don&#x27;t consider myself a \\&quot;girly\\&quot; girl, but I absolutely love the glitter: it&#x27;s fancy and happy and festive.  I also adore the orange accents.  Chalk it up to personal preference, but I feel like this epilator was practically designed for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use it: You move/glide the epilator over your skin just like you would a razor or electric shaver.  You don&#x27;t have to press hard, but the epilation head (the rotating, tweezing cylinder) and the cap need to be touching your skin.  The cap pivots, which is nice for going over curves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opted not to use the pre-epilation wipes because of the ingredient list (I&#x27;m more of a natural-products person).  I would guess that they have some sort of topical numbing agent in them, because it says to use them on your skin and then wait 30 minutes before epilating.  They might be just the ticket for some people, but not for me personally.  Plus, I wanted to see what the real deal was: I decided I&#x27;d either epilate \\&quot;sober\\&quot; or not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I was terrified that it was going to hurt, and I had to psyche myself up before using it.  I have a few small hairs at the bottom of my shin, so I decided to test the epilator there to see exactly how painful it would be.  I told myself that if it didn&#x27;t hurt too much, I would keep trying it on other areas; but if it was excruciating, well, at least the pain would be over quickly.  So I put the epilator to my skin, and, surprisingly, it just felt like a few tiny, rapidfire pinpricks.  I mean, yes, it hurt; but it wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as I expected, so I continued to use it and ended up doing both of my legs.  My pain threshold is probably on the slightly higher side of normal (thanks to a relentlessly cruel monthly gift from mother nature), and I found that epilating different areas of my body hurt to different degrees.  It hurt more to epilate my right leg than my left.  And my knees hurt more than my shins.  Surprisingly, the backs of my knees didn&#x27;t hurt at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I took the epilator off my skin, the pain stopped.  So you have complete control over how long you want the acute pain to last.  This may not happen with everyone, but I did get a slight endorphin rush to each area I had just epilated, much like what happens while you&#x27;re getting a tattoo.  Then I put on some lotion, and aside from the little red dots on my skin (which went away after about four hours), you&#x27;d never know I had just epilated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the vibrating massage cap, which is orange and has a set of textured rollers on either side of the epilation head.  When the epilator is turned on, this cap really does vibrate, which helps distract your skin from the temporary pain.  After an area has been effectively epilated (which you&#x27;ll know because it stops hurting), the vibration actually feels really nice on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawbacks:&lt;br /&gt;- The buzzing sound the epilator makes is kind of loud.  But every other small, motored device I&#x27;ve used has also been loud, so this probably can&#x27;t be helped.  Just know that this isn&#x27;t the kind of thing you can use in the same room as someone who&#x27;s sleeping, or even in the adjacent room with the door closed, because they&#x27;ll still hear it.&lt;br /&gt;-Yes, it hurts, especially if you&#x27;ve never used an epilator before.  But it&#x27;s not unbearable.  For me, the pain was tolerable, and the end result was worth it.  I intend to keep using it.  I&#x27;ve been plucking my eyebrows since my teens, which hurt at first but doesn&#x27;t anymore.  I can only assume the pain will likewise subside with continued and consistent epilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What helps reduce the pain?&lt;br /&gt;- Epilating a little bit at a time, stopping for a few minutes and doing something else (reading, checking your email, doing other parts of your beauty routine, etc.), and then resuming a few minutes later.  This helps to disperse the pain into more manageable increments.&lt;br /&gt;- Doing shorter strokes instead of long ones.  Run the epilator over your skin in the same way you would brush the short fur of a dog or cat (ever used a Furminator before?), pressing down momentarily with a short stroke, and then lifting the epilator back up almost immediately.  This makes the epilation process take longer, but I find that it&#x27;s far less painful to do little bits at a time.  Once you&#x27;ve \\&quot;cleared out\\&quot; a larger area, then you can go back over it in one long, continuous stroke to get any remaining hairs.&lt;br /&gt;- Remember to BREATHE.  Take long, deep breaths.  Unclench your jaw and relax your muscles.  Just like when you&#x27;re shaving, you can put yourself on \\&quot;autopilot\\&quot; when using the epilator and focus instead on making sure you&#x27;re breathing deeply and relaxing your muscles.&lt;br /&gt;- Although I haven&#x27;t personally tried this, two of my friends who use epilators agree that drinking a glass of wine beforehand helps takes the edge off the pain. ;)&lt;br /&gt;- One of those same friends also recommends singing while you epilate, so you have something else (positive!) to concentrate on as well as a kind of vocal catharsis for the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the epilator is fairly easy.  I was shocked at how many hairs had accumulated inside the cap.  I had to spend several minutes running the epilation head under the faucet as I used the small brush (included) to clean out all the little hairs that were stuck in it.  It was clean after about three minutes of thorough attention with the brush and flushing with water.  For me, that wasn&#x27;t too long to spend cleaning.  I let it air-dry overnight and put it away the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long does the epilation last?  Everyone&#x27;s hair grows back at different rates, but this epilator says that you&#x27;ll have smooth skin for 19 days.  I&#x27;ll come back and update my review when I&#x27;ve determined how long I can go between epilations.  I did notice that, after about 3 days, there were some tiny hairs that the epilator either didn&#x27;t get or that hadn&#x27;t broken the skin at the time I epilated.  It just took a few quick swipes to epilate these little fuzzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I really like this epilator, and I will definitely keep using it.  It beats shaving by a long shot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Update, August 2, 2011 **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using this epilator each week, and I have to say that it&#x27;s awesome.  My legs will stay totally smooth for about 48-72 hours, at which point a sparse \\&quot;batch\\&quot; of little hairs (from the previous week&#x27;s epilation cycle) will start growing back in.  Epilating once a week takes care of it.  I&#x27;ve also found that, if you epilate regularly, it hurts less each time.  This is because 1) you&#x27;re probably getting desensitized to it, and 2) there are fewer individual hairs to pluck out each time because they all grow back at slightly different rates.  So your first epilation is definitely the most painful, since you&#x27;re not accustomed to the pain but you&#x27;re also plucking out *all* the hairs in one go, instead of just a sparse batch each week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Update, September 1, 2011 **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was cleaning my epilator a few days ago and saw through a pinhole that a bunch of hairs had jammed themselves up next to the gear-turning mechanism.  The epilator was still working without a hitch, but it annoyed me that hairs could get trapped in a \\&quot;sealed\\&quot; compartment.  The compartment is secured with two Torx (six-pointed star) screws, which are typically used in electronics that consumers aren&#x27;t supposed to open (hard drives, mice, etc.).  Being a resourceful woman, I have [[ASIN:B000MF754W this handy little screwdriver &amp; bit set]] in my tool box and was able to use the T8 Torx bit to open the compartment.  Then I was able to flush out all the trapped hairs and reassemble the epilator when everything was dry.  An easy fix to a minor yet annoying design flaw, provided you have the right tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Update, August 31, 2012 **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using my epilator!  It&#x27;s great.  After almost a year and a half, it still holds a charge like a champ.  After epilating exclusively (i.e., not shaving) my legs for several months, I noticed that I started getting tiny ingrown hairs that would simply not break the skin but either coil or lie flat right below the surface, forming little bumps.  I realized I needed to exfoliate in combination with epilating, so I brought my razor back into the picture.  The schedule that works best for me is if I epilate over the weekend and then shave my legs about mid-week.  This has a dual purpose: 1) shaving mid-week keeps the new \\&quot;batch\\&quot; of hairs from getting terribly long before I epilate again, and 2) shaving also exfoliates the skin on my legs, thus preventing ingrown hairs.d under the faucet as I used the small brush (included) to clean out all the little hairs that were stuck in it.

    <li> I&#x27;ll preface this review that I am not in the target market for this product. However, my wife did not want to use it so I had to try it out for the Vine program. First off the packaging, this epilator comes with one other accessory top. The extra top is pretty basic and not sure exactly the purpose. I charged the Braun right after opening and it did not take long to be fully charged. After the charge, I tried to get my wife to use it to no avail. This was her first experience with an epilator and mine. I read the manual about proper usage and followed the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the top shown on the box on my face to the sides of my nose. This was really painful and actually felt like I had been hit with a weed eater on the cheek. I then proceeded to get my wife to use it on the back of my neck. This was not a comforting experience once again. I could assume from these experiences that the epilator&#x27;s sole purpose is women&#x27;s legs. My wife did not test it on her legs so others&#x27; reviews about the legs would be more beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another item I did not like about the epilator is the lack of accessories. The box shows there are many other tops to be used with the epilator but only two of the tops are in the box. The other tops have to be purchased separately. Not too practical when it retails for $100. As stated I know I am not in the target audience for this epilator, but thought I would try it to see if it was beneficial. Bottom line is the epilator is painful and I would rather shave any areas rather than use this epilator again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet if epilating is any better than just getting a nice electric shaver, but it is definitely an interestiing idea.    Pros:    1. The machine works quite well.  The light is great in helping you make sure you haven&#x27;t missed any straggler hairs.  The massage mode really cuts down on discomfort. The battery holds a great charge - I have used it twice in about three weeks and have only charged it the initial time.  2. Despite the fact that at first the machine somewhat disconcerted me because the moving tweezers in action appear like some modern torture method, there is very little discomfort considering you are yanking all the hairs out of your skin with it.  (Supposedly, epilating may cause some hairs to just stop growing back.)  3. The first time I used it, I did not feel I had to do any shaving or further epilating for well over a week.  I had very little irritation at first - a little redness that went away by morning.  (I use Noxema on my skin after epilating to soothe.  I used the pre-epilation wipes the first time, but went without the second time and the skin was a bit more irritated but not greatly so.)    Cons:  1. The on/off/speed switch is not my favorite - a bit awkward to use.  2. If you feel you NEED to epilate versus shaving, it is likely you have fairly thick and/or coarse hair, which I would imagine would cause the epilation to be a much more uncomfortable process.  3.  Epilation does cause me some irritation and ingrown hairs.  So far, I have been able to solve that problem with a bit of loofah-action on my legs, between epilating.  4. Epilating seems to cause the hairs to grow back in at an extremely varying rate, so it&#x27;s hard to decide when to do it again, because the hairs need to be long enough to pluck out, so you might have to epilate more than you want to.    Anyway, if you want to try epilating, this is a good machine that works well.</li>
    <li> Pros: I use it for leg&#x27;s hair removal, use it after bath while your body still warm. It removes hair very quickly and completely. Battery lasts very long.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Can be your nightmare if you didn&#x27;t do it in the right direction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of epilation - it&#x27;s like waxing without the expense or the hassle of going to a salon.  This epilator pays for itself the first time you use it and is especially good at getting the short hairs that other epilators miss. (ps the more you epilate the less it hurts, so if you are new to this it is worth persevering.)</li>
    <li> This is a terrible product. It doesn&#x27;t get 1/3 of the hairs and breaks off most of the rest. This is my second Braun and I thought the first epilator I got was okay, did the job well enough, but it seemed to dull or lose efficiency over time. So I thought I would go to a more expensive and supposedly better product. The new one didn&#x27;t have any of the accessories my old one had and was probably twice as much. Don&#x27;t buy this one; it is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This epilator is the newest generation of epilator on the market today. The object is to shave as if you are using an electric razor, except that it pulls the hair out from the root. As you might have guessed, this stings a bit. And because of the irregular way hair grows, you&#x27;ll have to do it about four or five times over about two weeks to really get all the hair. I&#x27;m not very hairy but still, I had to do this. After the initial epilation process, you&#x27;ll really start seeing results and appreciate this device. Also, the stinging lessens with every use so fear not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this, you get the epilator (small with a good weight and comfotable in the hand), a recharger (the device holds the charge for several uses), two epilation caps, a cleaning brush, a pouch and a package of Oil of Olay pre-epilation wipes which I think have some type of numbing effect (it still stung). The epilator is cordless and can be used in the shower for a wet shave too - even the battery is waterproof. The epilator also has a light for finding missed hairs. This was quite handy since it&#x27;s so difficult to catch missed hairs in indoor lighting. You always see them the minute you go out in a pair of shorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a handy little gadget to have around once you get over the initial pain. And it really works if you are willing to invest the money (not exactly inexpensive).</li>
    <li> I have never had an epilator before, and don&#x27;t use an electric razor. Before you make any assumptions, I do use a regular razor, thank you very much!&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this item because it looked so chicly packaged and I was sold by the gorgeous legs on the front! Who doesn&#x27;t want legs like that (well if you are a girl), especially in the summer? Pantyhose and stockings are no longer \\&quot;in\\&quot; in the summer...bare legs are a MUST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I carefully read the directions and still experienced some pain because I was so unfamiliar with any sort of epilator. Epilators do PULL your hair out--they do not cut it short...The positive intention is to keep your legs smooth for a longer period of time. I am too sensitive for this epilator. My legs are comfortable with my old razor. If you have tougher skin, and are willing to give it time, I would say it is a first class product of of its type. It is just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, jean</li>
    <li> I got the Braun Silk Epilator 7 as a gift. It does hurt somewhat in sensitive areas. It did not hurt when I used it on my legs. After using the epilator on my legs they got a little red. I mention the worst of it first because the end result is what I was looking for. I have always had a hair problem. Girls who complain about shaving their legs, drive me crazy! I wish that was all I had to do. Mostly I wish they had this particular product when I was 15. They might have but I did not know about it. I give this product a 5 star rating because it does the job. I love it! Its worth the minor pains and the price.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with an epilator, and I was pleasantly surprised! While the instructions aren&#x27;t quite comprehensive enough for me, the product was very effective on the legs. Pain? Oh yes, and my first thoughts the after epilating, was \\&quot;pain really can be good!\\&quot;. And the pain genuinely does decrease with each use. The first session felt like little tiny rubberband snaps, but stretch the skin with the other hand and using the wipes decreased that sensation significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipes are very effective, and I recommend them the first few times - it really does minimize the initial session discomfort. I also I read online our hair grows in stages, so while I realized it is much more effective than any razor I have ever used, I do start to get sparse stubble a few days later. But then I realized after continuing to use the epilator, that too decreases as the newer hairs are removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just went on a trip this past week for 5 days and didn&#x27;t even take my razor or epilator, never needed it! I have not tried this on the bikini line or underarms, but this is a great product for the legs and I would highly recommend the Braun Xpressive Pro! (review written by my wife, I don&#x27;t worry to much about the hair on my legs ;-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an Epilady for many, many years and the Braun SE 7181 WD Silk Epil 7 Epilator Xpress Pro is so much better than the Epilady model I&#x27;ve been using.  It has a rechargeable battery that lasts through 3 or more uses even though it is recommended you recharge after each use.  The light is really awesome!  I thought it might just be a sales gimmick but it really does help you see the fine hairs you would miss otherwise.  Braun claims you stay smooth a little longer, but for me it is about 7-10 days. I never felt this smooth with my Epilady!  Although I prefer to use it after showering, it is great that you can use it in the shower if you want to.  Very easy to clean with the small brush provided and/or running it under the facet. There are many different heads you can buy specifically for underarms, bikini area, etc., but I found the attachment that comes with the Braun has a pivoting head which does just fine in those areas.  I have nothing bad to say about this product...see you later Epilady!</li>
    <li> My wife says it was easy to use. Did as good on her as the professional hair removal trades people she grew up using in Egypt. Far superior to shaving, and does not give her the rash when using the hair removal creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says she is proud to recommend the epilator to anyone desiring a better method to remove facial and body hair.</li>
    <li> I got this product before I realized what a big deal it was to epilate, and that there was pain involved. Reading the instructions scared me and I avoided it for months! I have fine hairs on my leg and was going to use this elsewhere but chickened out! After all the anticipation, it really wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought, and the results are worth it! Your legs will be silky smooth and the hair will not grow back as fast as with shaving. I have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t have any bad reactions like I thought. I would recommend dry over wet, but that&#x27;s a personal preference</li>
    <li> Let me preface this review by saying that I am against the whole concept of an epilator that can be used in the shower or while the skin is wet. However, I had no luck finding a newer &#x27;dry only&#x27; model of my previous Braun X&#x27;elle - this wet/dry version seemed to be the only game in town. I could have saved about twenty or thirty bucks if I&#x27;d found the old fashioned version, as this one pulls hairs with the same efficiency and precision as the previous model, yet costs signficantly more. The other argument to possibly justify the cost is that it&#x27;s cordless, but again I would have preferred to save the money and stick with the corded version. Having epilated for three years, it has been my experience that the best way to ensure pulling hair at the root is to make sure skin is dry and taught, and of course being able to see exactly what you&#x27;re doing helps a lot. Standing in the shower with slippery skin and running an epilator over it is a good way to miss hairs and/or break them in half. In light of that, the rest of this review pertains to dry usage only - I did not and will not use under water or with wet skin.    This model is considerate to the needs of first-time epilators - those likeliest to experience pain with hair removal. Two different caps are included that fit over the tweezer element- one for beginners with the little roller heads on it to help lessen the pulling sensation -  this looked to be more or less the same one that they were including with my older model X&#x27;elle, so no upgrade there. The other cap is for those with prior epilation experience who want to get the job done as quickly as possible. I would note to beginners here that although it may lessen the pain to start out with the beginner&#x27;s cap and/or use this in the shower, don&#x27;t be surprised if you wind up with a lot of missed or broken off hairs that don&#x27;t come out at the root. What I would suggest to you first-timers who are afraid of the pain is to shave or wax first, wait 1 day to a week depending on your rate of hair growth, just until it&#x27;s a bit stubbly, and start out on dry skin with the starter cap for the best traction and results. Keep an ice pack handy if you feel you will need it. (This one does not come with one btw, whereas my prior X&#x27;elle did).    Being impervious to epilation pain on my lower legs and underarms at this point, the \\&quot;pro\\&quot; cap worked fine and I thought it moved along faster than my older model, but after using a couple of times I started to wonder why bother with any cap at all as it blocks some of the tweezers and creates an obstruction so that all tweezer heads do not come in contact with the skin. So I took the cap off and started epilating with the uncovered tweezer heads and found this thing can roll FAST! It swiftly  glided over my legs and removed hairs so quickly and painlessly -- until I reached a spot where a stubborn hair wasn&#x27;t coming out and I kept rolling over it. Long story short, don&#x27;t try this at home! I skinned about 2 inches off my leg and won&#x27;t be trying that again. Yes, the Braun does miss a couple of stubborn hairs that you have to keep going over but the vast majority get plucked out from the root and it is worlds better than the Emjoy at uprooting ingrowns.    Before I purchased this I didn&#x27;t realize it could only be used cordlessly. Which meant that some days I would have to plan ahead and recharge in advance, instead of just plugging in and using it whenever I felt like it. I also didn&#x27;t like the idea of having to worry about the battery dying midway through, but I have to say the charge lasted long enough for me to do both lower legs and then some (I usually don&#x27;t bother with the upper legs..prefer to shave or wax there) and it recharges fairly quickly. I also am finding that I use it more often as I enjoy the flexibilty and ease of use of a cordless model.     All in all, I really like the device and would give it 3.5 stars  - when used properly with a cap over the tweezer heads - it is totally painless and efficient. However I don&#x27;t think the price is justified as it tweezes just as well as the older models at a higher price point. Braun should bring those back - they are hard to find and I don&#x27;t know if they are still making them. Another issue with Braun is that they list their current models on their website with one name and they are sold under another, making it very difficult to figure out which product you&#x27;re actually buying and what features it has in it. For example the Xpressive that&#x27;s documented on the Braun website is marketed as the Silk Epil 7 everywhere else. Amazon is one of the few websites that uses both names in the product description so you know what product you&#x27;re getting, and that&#x27;s how I finally figured it out.</li>
    <li> They are the best epilators on the market, the good of this specific model is that it can get wet, ie you can use in the shower, I have given to my wife and she loves!.</li>
    <li> I think I would rather shave every day than mess with this thing.  This thing is painful!  I don&#x27;t think the results were any better than with shaving because I noticed stubble within a few days.  The device is very loud and it takes a long time to set up, use, and clean up afterward compared with shaving.  I tried to ignore the fact that it hurt so bad, but honestly I did not want to sit through it a second time.  Maybe if you have very fine, slow growing hair this would be a good option for you, but for my own thick fast-growing hair it is not worth it.  My legs prefer the razor!</li>
    <li> previous models of braun are better than this one, i have a dark hair so there are lots of ingrowns due to the razor this one has..it seems like half shaving sometime, and surely if you shave, you do not need to use this one??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have dark hair, buy the previous ones , not these new ones, unless you are happy with dark dots on your legs??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am dissatisfied and it is late to return it but i will use the old pink one again.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before buying this epilator. Most reviews claimed that this was the best. I&#x27;ve been using an epilator for at least 3 years now. I&#x27;ve had two before this one. On was similar to this one and the other was a coil method from the 70s. Of those two I preferred the one from the 70s. So despite the rave reviews for this one I was a bit worried because it was similar to the one I had before and didn&#x27;t love. HOWEVER, I love this one. The light is a GENIUS feature. What I didn&#x27;t like about the epilator I had before was that once I went over an area of my leg there was still a lot of hair left. The coil epilator was a bit better at removing all hair in the area but this epilator does the best by far. I will say again that I&#x27;ve been using an epilator for years so when I used this one it did not hurt me. HOWEVER, a friend who has never used an epilator before used this when I first got it. She thought it was very painful. But she tried it again after a bath and thought it was better. She continues to borrow it because she loves the results and is considering to buy one for herself. I believe that the first time using an epilator will always be the worst. Just knowing what to expect will help the pain the next time. I love using an epilator because I hated the feeling of sharp, rough legs the day after shaving. It just didn&#x27;t make any sense to me to do something day after day. So now I use this epilator once or twice a week and get nearly the same results. I am very happy with this epilator and hope you find the same love of epilating I have!</li>
    <li> I have really liked this product, thank you!  It works fast and epilates very well.  The only think I didn&#x27;t know is that it only works unplugged, so you have to have it charged every time yo wanna use it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this epilator for a couple of months now and am already reaping the benefits!  Use  I use it maybe once every 2 weeks? The epilator is very easy to use. Mine came fully charged and after reading some reviews I downed a glass of wine, used the wipes, and dove into the world of epilation. Because I had been shaving for almost 8 years my hair was growing in at different times and in different directions (the back of my legs used to come in diagonally lol) it took the first few weeks of using the epilator every 2 days for my legs to be hair-free. The device holds a charge for 2 or 3 epliations for me and then it charges after an hour or so. I tend to forget it&#x27;s charging so it may even be less time than that.   The Device  The epilator itself is the perfect shape for your hand and is very safe to use. I was wary of the tweezers pinching skin so I ran it over my palm to test it (I still do this when demonstrating the device to friends) and the epilator didn&#x27;t pinch my skin at all. It really only tweezes hair. The sound of the device is pretty horrifying. It&#x27;s very loud and is very intimidating for first time users. The noise is the reason I spent my first two epilation experiences a little tipsy but after I realized the sound is really the scariest part of the process I epilate sober. It&#x27;s been a few months so I&#x27;ve gotten use to the noise, my cats have not.   Hair  Since using this device, the thick course black leg hair I used to have to shave at least every 2 days has been growing in as a thin light leg hair! I barely notice when my legs have grown in because the hair is extremely light and even soft, just as it was before I started shaving 7 or 8 years ago. My husband doesn&#x27;t notice when the hair grows in either which is pretty remarkable considering he used to complain pretty frequently about the prickly feeling my hair had when growing in. My leg hair used to be so dark that a day after shaving you could see the black dots of the hair roots along my legs which always bothered me for formal events, the beach, etc. Now the hair is so light/thin you really only notice it when it&#x27;s very long and I&#x27;m in direct sun light. I love that after I epilate now my legs are as clear/clean looking as the legs of people who wax regularly.  Pain  Epilating feels exactly like what you would expect pulling hairs out by the root would feel like. Your experience is simply going to depend on your pain tolerance. I mentioned earlier that when I first started I would drink a glass of wine and use the wipes but now I don&#x27;t use either. I have a pretty high pain tolerance and realized it was the sound of the device that was psyching me out, I&#x27;m really not phased by epliating anymore. My best friend has tried it, she has a low pain tolerance (very low lol), and despite having waxed for years (meaning thin/light hair) she had to stop after after only a couple of minutes. My advice would be to relax, mentally prepare for some pain, and take the plunge if you feel up to it. It gets better with every time you do it.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that after reading all the reviews, I was worried that this would be too painful for me.  I tried laser hair removal and ended up losing the money that I paid for 6 sessions, because I couldn&#x27;t finish the second session - OUCH!  Ok, so call me a wimp...  I am a hispanic female with dark thick hair, and I have to shave daily, and by the end of the day my legs are stubbly again.  I finally broke down and bought this epilator.  The first time I used it, it hurt, but not as much as the laser removal.  I did my legs, and was so happy with the result that I tried my armpits.  That brought tears to my eyes, but when I saw the result - no shadow - I was encouraged.  I finished the armpits in less than 5 minutes.  I usually wax my bikini line, and using the epilator felt no different.  The result was the same, although it was harder to get to the area - maybe there is an attachment for this??  Now the best part:  I found my silky soft skin - finally - and it lasted more than a week.  The second time I used the epilator I did my legs, armpits and bikini area.  It did not hurt as much as the first time, and it took less time to do it.  I am so happy with this product.  I will NEVER shave again!</li>
    <li> I would say I love this hair remover but \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; is the word here.  I do love the end result.  I have to be in the right mood to use this little guy and maybe have a glass of wine too(ha, ha). My kids think it is very entertaining to watch me. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipes seem to help a bit to dull the pain and the little massage from the epilator distracts from the pain as well.  Basicly it is tweezing your hairs out and trying to get many at a time so what can you expect? I have found that my skin stays red for about 24 hrs after using this so don&#x27;t use it right before an event. Also, as my hairs come back in sometimes grown in/under.  This does not happen when I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long term effect of using the epilator is that eventually about half of my hair stopped growing at all and is much lighter. Nice!!</li>
    <li> So of course it is not pleasant the first time you use one of these, I knew this going in but I hate the way my legs feel after shaving. So instead of wasting a bunch of money on electrolysis and waxing I decided on epilating.    After looking around online I decided on this epilator because I heard the braun series was good and I wanted one you could use in the shower/bath. I did not even try it dry because I wanted the most comfortable epilation experience.     Doing my legs in the bath with soap and water was not too bad. Some spots were worse than others, but it was just an intense stinging most of the time. Nothing I couldn&#x27;t handle.It did take about two hours to do my legs but I don&#x27;t think it will take that long next time. I started with the attachment with the massage beads first and got most of the hairs that way, then I did not have any attachments on and epilated most of the little hairs it did not catch before which worked pretty well. I also epilated my lower back because I have some fuzz that grows there and that barely hurt at all. There were little red dots on my legs after but I just put after epilation cream on them and they went away. Now my legs and back are silky smooth. :)    However I could not do my armpits. I ended up shaving them, then epilating the couple of hairs the razor did not get which was still super painful. I will continue to shave then epilate the missed hairs on my underarms until I can finally epilate the whole pit. I will also do the same for bikini as the pain is an intense there as armpits.    Overall epilating was as I expected and I really the this epilator because its light, has a pretty good battery life,can be used wet or dry, and looks cute. I give it four stars because it only comes with two attachments for the price and they are basically the same (one with massage beads and one without).It also says can epilate hair size of sand grain, which is not true, I had some little hairs like that and there are still a few that it missed. However I am happy with my choice and do recommend this epilator to any beginners.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd eplilator I have used.  Works really well for legs, highly recommend for that.  Works well on even short hair.  I would not recommend for underarm areas.  I found it left red marks there.  I will continue to use my other epilator for that, since it does a better job and doesn&#x27;t leave the marks and/or hurt.  This trimmer is very easy to hold, came with a package of the wipes that are also nice.  It is chargeable which is nice.  It also can be used wet, although I prefer to do it dry.</li>
    <li> WHO WAS TESTED:::&lt;br /&gt;Well, I tested this product on everybody but my boy and the cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I used it on my legs.  (Was NEVER tempted to try it elsewhere.)  I&#x27;m a long time waxer and so the hair density was not great, but rather sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I tried the epilator on my entering Middle-schooler.  Long, fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, my husband got it into his head to try this on a section of his face where he was pretty sure he&#x27;d never want to grow a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINDINGS:::&lt;br /&gt;For both my husband and my tween the process was too painful.  The face I understood, but I was surprised that my daughter asked to stop since it was this or hairiness -- at least for the time being.  Perhaps in retrospect I should have known this.  We (daughter and I) tried using wax strips, and she couldn&#x27;t proceed with that either.  She&#x27;s just too sensitive to even mild levels of pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for myself, I thought the Braun Epilator was great.  It wasn&#x27;t without a little sting, but pretty much on the order of waxing.  AND where the epilator has the advantage at this stage of my leg hair removal is that it works perfectly with short hair... with which wax doesn&#x27;t work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SKINNY:::&lt;br /&gt;To know whether to buy this for girls, you are going to have to know their &#x27;pain&#x27; threshold.  This epilator works well with both short and long leg hair, but if the girl in your life won&#x27;t use it, then it&#x27;s money wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this Braun epilator is perfect for those, like me, who have previously waxed our legs to silky smoothness.  The slight sting will be nothing, and you can remain smooth forever because the epilator works on the short hair that the wax can&#x27;t touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pam T~&lt;br /&gt;mom/blogger</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the product so far, good value for money. Received in a proper package as described.&lt;br /&gt;overall happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used. I have thick black hair that you can see through my thin skin even after I&#x27;ve shaved and legs feel smooth, so I&#x27;ve been dying to try an epilator to try and pull it all the way out. First time I used it, it hurt like crazy! I could only bear to do half my legs. But ever since then it&#x27;s gotten easier and much much less painful. It&#x27;s fast and easy. My only complaint is that it can&#x27;t quite get the super short hairs, so even though my legs look hair-free (which is the primary goal), they still feel a little stubbly. The box says it is the best at getting short hairs, but it doesn&#x27;t get all of mine even when using the efficiency cap. I also find that it doesn&#x27;t last 4 weeks like it says. I&#x27;ve been doing a full-leg epilation session about once a week, then a time or two in between for spot touch ups. Despite the stubblies, I still think this is a great product. Definitely beats shaving every day and that annoying razor burn I always had! I&#x27;m hoping that over time it will continue to improve and my legs will eventually be nice and smooth all the time!</li>
    <li> Works only n legs unless you purchase the different caps. Overall works great!</li>
    <li> I loved the first Braun epilator I bought from Amazon so much I just had to get this one for traveling.</li>
    <li> I used for the first time last night.  After reading reviews on the pain I chose to have a glass of wine and go for it!  It was not as painful as expected.  Waxing the bikini area is painful, this felt like brief pin pricks.  Not a big deal.  The hair on my legs was longer than the recommended in the instructions too.  I also used on my face and am very pleased.  The light really helps in finding and eliminating those little hairs!  I hope this holds up and wish I would&#x27;ve purchased sooner.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with an Epilator, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other brands, but can tell you that the Braun SE7181 WD Silk Epilator Xpressive Pro works great!  I did one section of my leg so that I could compare Epilating to shaving - and let me tell you the difference was amazing!  The section that I used the Epilator on was silky smooth and stayed that way well after the shaved section started growing in.  It does hurt to use.  I guess over time you would get more accustomed to it, but it is a tad painful at first.  Will I continue to use it?  Yes, I will - but will be selective about where I use it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been very hairy, so the entire epilator scene passed me by the first time around. I do remember a girlfriend, much more hirsute than I, who invested in an epilator for her legs. She delighted in making me almost pass out from her tales of pain and horror.    I can honestly say that the Braun Epilator is nothing even close to that. The hair on my lower legs is probably the worst hair problem I have, but even that hair is relatively light and sparse. It took two sessions, but I think the hair is just gone - nothing seems to be growing back, and it&#x27;s been 3 weeks.    The actual pain quotient isn&#x27;t really that bad. It&#x27;s along the lines of plucking your eyebrows and getting a few hairs with roots to China. You wince momentarily, but the pain is gone soon enough.     I found it totally tolerable. Having said that, though, hell will freeze over before I try THIS on my underarms! The mere thought of it brings me back to the girlfriend with torture tales from the original epilator!     I&#x27;d strongly recommend it for your legs. Underarms? You&#x27;re a better woman than me!</li>
    <li> Some quick thoughts on this model specifically:&lt;br /&gt;* Removes smaller hairs than earlier models, so you can be more aggressive as stray hairs start to grow back&lt;br /&gt;* The \\&quot;massagers\\&quot; on the epilation head really do help&lt;br /&gt;* You can use it dry or completely-wet, but not damp (e.g., right after the shower won&#x27;t work)&lt;br /&gt;* You can&#x27;t use it while plugged in (that would be a serious safety hazard in the shower! but it means that whenever the battery eventually stops holding a charge, you&#x27;ll have to toss the unit)&lt;br /&gt;* I wish it included a trimming head, for the cases when you have longer hairs you want to attack (they have to be 1 cm or shorter before this will really pull them out)&lt;br /&gt;* The small spotlight on the unit makes it much easier to see hairs you may have missed&lt;br /&gt;* The wipes really do help. You&#x27;ll use one and think it didn&#x27;t help that much, then try the other leg without one at all, and realize it WAS helping more than you realized :) I used them the first time I epilated, but haven&#x27;t bothered subsequently.&lt;br /&gt;* Update: after a year or two of using this item, the cap pops off while you&#x27;re using it, which is seriously annoying. But I love it apart from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And some thoughts on epilation in general:&lt;br /&gt;* This seems obvious, but I have to say it: it only hurts when a hair is being removed. This means that the first time you epilate, it&#x27;s very uncomfortable. But since only a small percentage of the hair later grows back, the subsequent touch-ups really aren&#x27;t bad at all, especially on your legs. (Underarms are less comfortable, and bikini area even less so.)&lt;br /&gt;* The first time you epilate, your legs will be unbelievably smooth. But hair grows back at different rates, so after a month or so of epilating (maybe one time each week), you&#x27;ll have tiny hairs here and there, that are starting to grow back, but are still too small to get. It&#x27;s less of an issue with this epilator than others, and the hairs aren&#x27;t really visible. So if youthink someone&#x27;s going to be touching your legs, then shave :-D  but otherwise life is much easier if you just epilate once a week or so. Then if you don&#x27;t bother doing anything for a month or so, you&#x27;ll have a few stray hairs here and there, but nothing like someone who shaves regularly and then skips a month (or even a week... or even 3 days). Visible stubble is entirely a thing of the past.&lt;br /&gt;* You do have to use a loofah or some other type of exfoliation on your legs occasionally to prevent ingrown hairs (just little bumps on your legs--mine don&#x27;t turn red). But if you wax, or if you age ;) you&#x27;ll have to do that anyway&lt;br /&gt;* And how could I forget the #1 reason to epilate: no more underarm bumps. You know, the ones that you ALWAYS have, despite a million products on the market that say they&#x27;ll banish them but don&#x27;t? Sometimes when you epilate, your skin will be red for 30-90 seconds afterward, but then it fades. So NO MORE BUMPS. That alone is reason enough to own an epilator, IMO :)</li>
    <li> I had never even heard the word \\&quot;epilator\\&quot; and was so intrigued when I stumbled across one.  Before committing, I did my research for a few days.  I found this particular epilator had the greatest combination of positive reviews as well as other factors such as price.  Off I went to Target and was back in 15 minutes (out $99 bucks) but ready for two hairless weeks ahead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after taking it out of the box I could tell by the quality of the machine it was a powerful little thing.  I skimmed the directions and even watched a \\&quot;how-to\\&quot; video I found on YouTube.  Sat down on the couch pulled my pant leg up and let her rip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RIP IT DID!!!  The pain was unbearable.  No more then 5 seconds went by before I sent my boyfriend to the store for wine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determined to be hair free, I took a 30 minute wine drinking break before I got to it again.  One full minute went by this time before the boyfriend was sent out yet again for bubble bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;45 minutes later the wine was gone and I&#x27;m soaking in a tub of bubbles.  using this method, I was able to do half of one calf...  yes HALF I was so proud of myself I almost did the other half.  ALMOST that is until I realized after this calf was a second, followed by two thighs and 2 knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of crazy things I would do to never shave again.  Torturing myself until I have a migrane is NOT one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now in fairness I must say, my hairless half calf was smooth as can be and it actually lasted around 1.5 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;(Another positive thing, was how entertained my boyfriend was watching me cuss and scream.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know pain is different for everyone so I will mention I have pale skin with dark course hair (gross I know).  I also have a medium pain tolerance.  I have my eyebrows waxed every two weeks and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly this product went back to Target the next day and, I will be shaving until the next miracle product comes along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this epilator 3 stars because to be fair IT WORKS! But really, I would rather shave twice a day then do this even once a year and THAT is a fact!ng.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this epilator 3 stars because to be fair IT WORKS! But really, I would rather shave twice a day then do this even once a year and THAT is a fact!</li>
    <li> When I first saw this epilator in the store, I had initially thought it was an electric razor. When I read the description, I still didn&#x27;t think anything of the \\&quot;40 tweezers\\&quot;. I decided to read some reviews on it and do a bit more research. When I learned what epilation was, it sounded very scary, but I still went ahead and purchased one because I&#x27;m really tired of razors. I figured if all these women are doing it, some of them saying it isn&#x27;t all that bad and they have a low pain tolerance, so can I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the instructions to let the hair on my legs grow out a bit, I had it charged and ready to go. When it came time to epilate, I realized I psyched myself into thinking it would be really painful. Despite the wonderful reviews and advice of others, all I could focus on was the word PAIN that I saw in about every review and even the instruction booklet. I tried it in the shower the first time and the device is very loud and scary...very intimidating. I pulled about two hairs and it was pretty painful...enough to make me give up on continuing. I just couldn&#x27;t get over the fact that 40 small tweezers were going to pull at my leg hair. For about 3 days straight, I sat in the shower with my epilator hovering over my leg and then giving up. Then I decided to wait until I could do it with my boyfriend around because he simply just comforts me. I still wanted to try it before I saw him though, just so I knew what to expect and didn&#x27;t freak out around him. I decided to take some advice from others and took two tylenol before (I also read some say whine helps, but I don&#x27;t drink). I did a small patch on my shin one day and another patch the next. I now knew what to expect, and that was pain. I can&#x27;t really say if the pain killers helped at all because I haven&#x27;t epilated without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When with my boyfriend, I decided to try the dry epilation. Once again, I took some tylenol, then used the wipes, and just went for it. He was very supportive and I actually got through one leg. I didn&#x27;t touch my knees or my thighs, though. My ankles probably hurt the worst, followed by the back of my leg. Personally, if it&#x27;s your first time, dry or wet will be painful. There wasn&#x27;t a big difference for me as far as pain. While doing it dry, I also had some music playing and I noticed when singing or humming, it made it fairly easier. It was very difficult for me to get through it and the hardest part was letting it stay on my leg and move upwards slowly as the instructions say. Instead I was doing a more tweezing-sheering movement. I don&#x27;t think that was the best way to do it but that&#x27;s how I got through it xD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One leg down...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to google some epilation tips and there was some on the Braun website (see below). It mentions submerged epilation. Since I tried it dry and in the shower, I figured I mine as well try this too. I mentally prepared for it about all day. When it came time, I took some tylenol again and ran the bath. I hooked up my iHome in the bathroom so that I could have the singing/humming distraction. I sat in the bath with my legs fully submerged. The website says to let them sit in the water for 5 minutes, but still being a coward, I sat there for about 7-8. I even went the extra mile and rubbed up and down my leg to loosen the hair further. I turned on the epilator and dipped it in the water, finding it a bit strange submerging an electric device. It was completely fine, though, and the noise was very muffled. I then began, making sure to stretch the skin, wincing at my ankle area. I then realized through my bit of singing and humming that I was epilating. I was moving up my leg slowly and continuously as directed by the instructions. It hurt, yes, but not as much. I even did my knees and thighs on both legs. After careful thought, I have come to the conclusion that it was the loud, scary, torture-device-sounding noise of the epilator that was psyching me out. If you&#x27;re someone that can&#x27;tstand the sounds of let&#x27;s say, a dentist office, the submerged epilation might help in relaxing the mind. It was also less painful for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con about the submerged epilation is it&#x27;s harder to see what you&#x27;re doing. I didn&#x27;t do it this time, but I might suggest doing a touch up with the shower running or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t mean for my review/story to be so long, but I figured it might help someone like me &#x3D;] Also, I haven&#x27;t seen any reviews on the submerged epilation. Just about everything everyone has been saying is true though. It is painful, and I&#x27;m hoping for less and less pain each time. The pain, however, is just that instance of hair removal (almost like pulling a hair off your head and you need to rub or scratch for relief). Sometimes I get a lingering on and off burn/sting after, but nothing all that painful. I also expected a lot more reddening and red spots, but there wasn&#x27;t too much of that either. One thing I do have to get used to is getting the epilator closer to my legs. My legs aren&#x27;t all that smooth since the hair was quite long and I hovered more than anything. Eventually I&#x27;ll get around to maybe using the second speed setting and the efficiency head. For now, however, I need to just get used to epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning it is simple enough with the small brush it comes with, but there are some hairs that get stuck on the side that are a little bit stubborn to come out. Higher pressure water paired with the brush helped, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time user 1-10 pain rating, 10 being the worse:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry with wipes: 8&lt;br /&gt;Shower: 8&lt;br /&gt;Submerged (soak 7-8 min): 6&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards(on and off): 0.5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it helps, I am latina and my hair is very dark and thick.

    <li> First thing: The pain threshold on this not non-existent but it is tolerable. Also, this is a lot more comfortable to use on shorter hair. On a scale of 1 to 5, the pain threshold was about a 3.3 on longer hair in more coarse areas (the front part of the leg) and a 1.3 on shorter hair in less coarse areas (like the back of the leg, where it almost didn&#x27;t hurt at all). It was a lot more comfortable than waxing, but it took a whole lot longer than either waxing or shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me it achieved about the same results shaving with a good razor. It removed about the same amount of hair and the results were not noticeably smoother. It lasted on average about 3 or 4 days longer than shaving. Didn&#x27;t quite get a week in before I wanted to shave again. A far cry from the 2+ weeks they advertise. Not quite worth the pain, but it wasn&#x27;t so painful I won&#x27;t continue to use it from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To save time, after a couple of uses I went back to regular shaving. First time the results were great, even better than usual. Second and third time, not so great. I had a lot of ingrown hairs, not something I&#x27;m used to having after shaving. My skin felt uncomfortable and a little bumpy, especially on the front part of the leg. It makes me not want to use the device anymore. After a few weeks my skin has returned to normal and I can get my normal shaving results again. Since I&#x27;ve never used an epilator before, I will give it another chance not to irritate skin since that is apparently what happened. I also want to try using it exclusively (if I can stand it) for a few months and see if the results get better and if the ingrown hairs return or not. To clarify though, my skin did not feel really irriated until I went back to shaving. But shaving had never irritated my skin before either. After using the epilator, the right leg has been slightly irritated while the left leg has been fine. The post shaving irritation that I felt affected both legs equally though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notes: The unit is loud. Not so loud I couldn&#x27;t watch a hockey game, listen to music, or hold a conversation with someone (in person of course) and use this unit at the same time, but too loud to watch anything else except a horror movie. The hair removing process took a lot longer than I expected. It probably took me an hour the first time(including breaks) to do both legs. I almost didn&#x27;t finish. The battery charge gave out on me just as I was finishing up. The second time it only took about 15 minutes per leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried both the massaging head and the regular epilating head. Both times with the wipes on dry skin. The pain threshold seemed to be the same. But for some reason with either head (and it doesn&#x27;t matter which leg I start with) the right leg hurts more than the left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sold on epilators yet and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it yet over shaving (over waxing yes!), but I will see if with time it gets more comfortable and yields better and longer results.is loud.

    <li> I purchased this item, and I was very pleased with this purchase. yes it was a little expensive, but I chose this epilator because it is water-proof and you can use it in the shower or tub. It does just what it says it does - It rips your hair out by the root; so yes it does hurt. It hurts extremely bad the first time you use it, but if you keep using it after that it really does not hurt nearly as bad. I used it both wet and dry, and I feel as if it hurts a lot more in the shower, but that could be me. I also felt as if it missed a lot of the hairs when used wet, that is why I gave it 4 stars. Otherwise, when used dry, it plucks out all of your hairs and after a while doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad. I have light skin and rather thick dark brown almost black hairs. I have used it on my legs and underarms with wonderful results. My hair seems to not grow back as thick and I only have to do my armpits about every week and a half. All in all this was a good buy and I would recommend it to anyone who hates shaving.</li>
    <li> I use this thing for armpits, legs, arms, and fine tiny almost invisible hair on my face. Works like a charm! Been using it for more than a year now, love it! Removes the thinest hair without causing much uncomfortable, EXCEPT the bikini area - way too painful for there.</li>
    <li> I have been using epilators for almost 20 years and this is the first one that has grabbed my skin into the tweezers.  It usually grabs the skin by my knees and underarms which leaves uncomfortable scrapes, and I have to push the head of the epilator back down for it to begin to work again. I&#x27;ve tried pulling the skin more taught I&#x27;ve tried the different speeds and different pivot heads and continue to get the same painful results. I previously used an Emjoi epilator for several years. The wider head meant that it covered more area and it never sucked my skin into the the tweezers. My next purchase, to immediately replace this product ASAP will be another Emjoi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it&#x27;s not grabbing my skin it does work well but who wants to have large areas of their underarms and small areas of their legs unshaven while the rest is smooth?</li>
    <li> Used both wet and dry functionality&lt;br /&gt;Hardly ever need to keep going over the same area&lt;br /&gt;LED light is a real help</li>
    <li> Recently I bought this item from amazon for my Mom  And she is very satisfied, amazing features, advanced technology and great price!!!</li>
    <li> If you are brave enough to tackle self waxing you are brave enough to use this product. I have used the wax strips and found them to be messy and difficult to use. They left hair behind and it was difficult to get rid of the residue. I always got frustrated and gave up half way through. I figured I would give this a shot, (for the price of about 5-6 botched wax strips attempts.)     Attempt 1  \\&quot;Ouch\\&quot;    It will hurt. The best way to get through it is with some ice packs and short strokes. It took me several sessions to do both legs. I had let the hair grow pretty long so that may have made it more painful. If you start out with hair a little shorter it will not be quite so bad. Once it was all done.....wow, very nice. I think I will try my arms.....    Attempt 2  \\&quot;Hmmmm not so bad\\&quot;    After a week I noticed some longer hairs back on my legs so i went back over them. It was quick and easy. The light made it really easy to see where the hairs were. There are still some hairs that are too short for it to grab so there is some stubble. I will let it grow a bit and try again. I did try my arms. The hands were OK, when I tried the arms I got goosebumps so bad that I could not continue.     Attempt 3  \\&quot;There was blood\\&quot;    Things were going swimmingly with my legs, my hands were smooth, so I decided how bad could the armpits be? BAD. Perhaps my technique was poor or I have particularly well anchored pit hairs but i got 1/2 way through the left side and felt that I had donated enough blood and called it quits.   Conclusion: If you can make it past the initial session it is great for legs and hands. Not great for pits. I didn&#x27;t try the bikini area, but i&#x27;m not opposed to trying it in the future.</li>
    <li> I have put off writing this review, thinking I would grow to love this epilator.  I don&#x27;t think of myself as sensitive or wimpy, but I used this once, and though it worked as advertised, it HURT.  I&#x27;ve had three children, and though this obviously doesn&#x27;t compare pain wise, the results of child birth made doing it again worth it.  However, despite leaving it on my vanity for months, I cannot bring myself to try this again.  I guess the results just aren&#x27;t worth the pain to me.  Back to my trusty old razor ;)</li>
    <li> This epilady actually just breaks the hair, and misses a lot of the black ones. My skin does not feel smooth at all!!!!! I had one from Walmart that lasted me forever, was 35$, and did awesome job, didn&#x27;t break hair or miss. I was hoping with buying a more expensive epilady, it would do a faster job. I still have to go over and over, exactly if not MORE like my old one which was 50$ less.&lt;br /&gt;It has caught my skin in it, and it pinched my skin so that I ended up with a bruise. This is cordless, BUT, it loses its charge in about 45-50 minutes, and when it runs out, you cant use it until its been recharged!!! You cant use it while plugged in!!!!  You cant even use it plugged in?? What is that? Ive gotten caught where I was only 3/4 of the way done and it ran out of power. It was right&lt;br /&gt;before I was going out!!!&lt;br /&gt;I hate this product and wish I would have just spent 35$ at walmart again. Im going to ask my daughter&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY, ONLY benefit to this epilady is that it has a light that helps to see the hair better than a regular one. I regret this purchase so much, and wish I would have returned it before my priviledge of doing so expired.&lt;br /&gt;Money down the drain ladies, I don&#x27;t care how many positive reviews its gotten (which is why I bought it)</li>
    <li> This is the third epilator I&#x27;ve bought and have been using them since the original Epilady came on the market - 20+ years ago.  I did buy a second Epilady when the first one finally died but the second one never did work very well.  So, I decided to switch brands and bought this Braun.  What an amazing difference !  This Braun does a much much better job than either of the other two Epiladies ever did.  The one thing about this one that I&#x27;m not thrilled with is that you absolutely cannot use it if it&#x27;s plugged in.  So, after I use it, I have to be sure and plug it in to recharge it right then and there or it may not have enough battery power left the next time I want to use it.  Other than that, it is well worth the price and I would definitely recommend buying it!</li>
    <li> nice my sister happy with it</li>
    <li> I use it for my arms and so far i love it.</li>
    <li> I had an emjoi optima for many years (close to 8!) but i was ready to see what else was out there. This feature-hefty product was just the trick. I opted for this model over the Braun 7681 Silk Epil 7 because at the end of the day, the Braun 7681 was twice the price for a few extra pieces of plastic I wasn&#x27;t sure I would really use. I&#x27;m not a beginner so the Braun 7681&#x27;s beginner cap is moot and I have a razor should I want to shave so the shaver head wasn&#x27;t a big sell either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this bad boy is great! I love the light and the massaging rollers make the pain almost disappear. I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower or with the wipes yet, but I love that it&#x27;s fully washable- something that used to bug me about the Emjoi Optima.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish you could use it while plugged in since I worry it will die on me mid-session, but it hasn&#x27;t yet. In fact, the charge lasted closer to 1 hour for me at the highest speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my legs are still smooth three weeks later, touch-ups take a second and I&#x27;m glad I tried something new.</li>
    <li> I received my epilator yesterday (4/13/2012) I am sooo disappointed. First of all it hurts pretty badly, second I had to go over both legs about 5 times...... and I still have a lot of stubble!I decided to wait until today to try it again jsut incase the hair was too short (btw the product description says it&#x27;ll get hair as short as a grain of sand, HA!) I don&#x27;t know exactly what the wipes are for, it didnt hurt any less. I will be returning this product. Please save your time money and pain trust me you dont want this!</li>
    <li> Been using it for a couple of months now.  I don&#x27;t shave anymore.  It does what it says it does. I recommend thoroughly cleaning your underarms and making sure no deodorant is there or else the epilator will start to stink and all that.  That happened to me.  I just soaked it under baking soda and water overnight lol.  make sure to clean it out once in awhile.  I just use a regular toothbrush...it is so much easier than the cleaning brush they provided.  Oh and don&#x27;t expected it to be as great as shaving.  It doesnt get EVERYTHING, like shaving....But it gets most and it gets the job done...oh and for me, it still does hurt...I do have a very low tolerance for pain haha so I&#x27;m a crybaby...It is still a little painful epilating in the shower, but I can take it.  Whatever, I&#x27;d rather not shave cuz that makes your underarms dark and blahblahblah.  This one might take a little longer but it&#x27;s better for my underarms &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I got this epilator because I have eczema that gets extremely aggravated when I shave my legs. I will say that it&#x27;s not painless, but you have to expect some pain when hairs are being pulled out of your legs at rapid succession. With that said, on a scale of 1-5 (least to most painful) here&#x27;s how I&#x27;ll rate this epilator.&lt;br /&gt;Legs: 3&lt;br /&gt;Underarms: 4&lt;br /&gt;Bikini: 5&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that the more you do it, the less it hurts.&lt;br /&gt;My hair grows back in about 2-3 weeks and I do need to use an inhibitor as we&#x27;ll as exfoliate like crazy, otherwise it&#x27;s slightly uncomfortable when the hairs start to break the skin. Even with this, it&#x27;s tremendously better than shaving AND with razors costing so much it&#x27;s worth the investment. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love it! Best epillator i ever had,high quality. Works fast and efficient. I use it for my underarms only,bikini and legs - gives me ingrown hairs. But for underarms works great,better than shaving!!!  Best price,quality and value!! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Just received order today and I love it. Never used one before, but it&#x27;s not as painful as I thought. I think it&#x27;s great. Used it on arms and legs so far. Will update when I&#x27;ve used it in more sensitive places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The sensitive places (bikini area) was painful to do, but I found it worth it because it lasts so much longer than shaving, is no more painful than waxing, and easier to do yourself. You should trim hair that is an inch or longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;October 2013: This epilator worked extremely well for about 16 months. To be fair, I used it A LOT, almost daily to keep all stubble from becoming noticable. I did not use it wet. I found it worked best with a SMALL amount of baby powder (best kind has some corn starch). It is now a year and a half after I purchased the Braun. It is no longer working the way it used to. It&#x27;s not broken, it just no longer pulls the hair out. I cleaned it out gently with no luck. I would have liked it to last at least two years, but no such luck. I did use it frequently, but I also took very good care of it. I am probably going to try a different brand to see how well it works and for how long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy epilating ladies (and a few gentlemen).</li>
    <li> Before I get into anything further, let me start by saying that if you&#x27;re thinking about purchasing this product, if possible, buy the corded version - it&#x27;ll save you some time. With that said, if you aren&#x27;t going to fork out the extra cash for the corded version, I don&#x27;t see why paying the extra money for the one with all of the attachments would be necessary. I&#x27;ve used this on my legs, arms, underarms, bikini area, and face with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, my hair is very dark, very thick, and very coarse. I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun when it comes to hair removal, save having it lasered off. Shaving has been nearly pointless for me, always leaving my legs irritated, prickly, and still dark from the follicle shadows. Not to mention plagued with ingrown hairs (though I do get obvious red bumps and ingrown hairs, mostly I have hairs that grow sideways and under the skin and I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s actually an ingrown hair). Anyways, before epilating, I would advise taking a shower and gently exfoliating your legs. This seemed to yield better results in my case. Even waxing (and I mean legitimate wax heated in a wax pot, not just pre-waxed Sally Hansen strips from CVS) hardly did anything for me. Definitely not what waxing should have done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with my legs: If you&#x27;re concerned about the pain factor, it isn&#x27;t that bad, and I have a fairly low pain tolerance. It just feels like little pinpricks. However, some areas are more sensitive than others, like the backs of my legs and inner thighs. Once I had finished, I didn&#x27;t have that ultra smooth feeling, but I didn&#x27;t expect to. If you have fine hair, you may. Anyways, all I did was shave quickly after epilating and my legs were surprisingly smooth. I could hardly see any shadows. It&#x27;s been three days now, and they still feel the same. I&#x27;m pleased with the results. Be sure and use a mild lotion afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arms: I also have very dark hair on my arms that I findembarrassing, and started to shave them within the last year. I&#x27;ve also waxed them. I had better results with waxing than I did with the epilator, but still, I feel that if you epilated and shaved, they would be smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bikini area: As expected, this hurts quite a bit more than epilating your legs, but it&#x27;s still tolerable. I didn&#x27;t need to shave this area in addition to epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underarms: If you don&#x27;t like pain, STAY AWAY. Underarms were always the part I dreaded waxing, even more so than a full on Brazilian bikini wax. I used this on my underarms in the shower, and that was the first time that I had used the epilator wet. It didn&#x27;t hurt as bad, but that&#x27;s probably because it wasn&#x27;t working as well. You probably won&#x27;t be happy with the results if you try to use this in the bath or shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face: I sort of have sideburns since my hair is so dark, and this worked well for that. However, if you plan to epilate an area for the first time, such as your face or anywhere else there may be significant hair growth, shave first. Shave, wait a few days, and then try epilating. It hurts far less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this product. It has worked better for me than even waxing has. It was worth the money for me.</li>
    <li> My bf got this for me as a surprise gift. It&#x27;s the second braun epilator I&#x27;ve used. The biggest issue for me is the time it takes to charge, and the time it actually works before the red light goes on and it needs to be recharged again. Personally, I can tolerate the pain as it only hurts badly for the first few moments. Using this epilator drives me crazy, before I even finish one leg the battery is already dead (no, I&#x27;m not soooo hairy!). Also, I expected more accessories, like a head with less tweezers, etc. Going back to corded epilator.</li>
    <li> I ordered this epilator to replace my first epilator after six months of getting used to epilation.&lt;br /&gt;I must admit that the first time I used this device on my leg, I was shocked.  It hurt more than I expected, and the light revealed SO MUCH hair!  I felt like I had to go over the same area again and again before all the hair was gone.  Disapointed, I opened the device to clean out the head and was floored by how much hair was trapped in the device.  I ran my hand up my leg and was surprised how smooth it was.&lt;br /&gt;My previous epilator hadn&#x27;t done half as good of a job.&lt;br /&gt;This epilator is great for the teeny tiny hairs that you can&#x27;t even see.  It doesn&#x27;t like longer hairs, and often pulls and breaks them before plucking.  It occasionally breaks the hairs in my underarm region instead of plucking, but all in all, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this epilator.&lt;br /&gt;I will be keeping my old epilator, which had a curved head that does not swivel, for my toes, eyebrows, and other areas where a flat-headed epilator doesn&#x27;t fit very well.  Maybe the additional heads would help with those areas, I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;For legs, this epilator is perfect.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using an Epilator and I&#x27;m mixed about the experience. The sensation is something I am not used to. I&#x27;ve been waxed and I shave- but this is different. What Braun calls \\&quot;extra gentle\\&quot; to me isn&#x27;t and this is coming from a person who gets waxed and it dosen&#x27;t hurt at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could feel it picking and cutting- not so bad I would never use it again but not what i&#x27;d call a comfortable experience-  by any stretch of the imagination.  I had to stretch the skin in some areas to get the hairs and on the bony spots around the ankle. A couple times I still saw hairs but for the most part i&#x27;d say it worked to some extent. I noticed some red bumps when I first used it despite using the wipes beforehand- They went away and &#x27;most&#x27; of my legs were smooth, though 2 days later I feel picks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun claims skin irritation and pain will go away with the continued use of the epilator.. Used it twice, second time wasn&#x27;t very pleasant either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit has close grip technology with 40 tweezers and claims to remove hairs short as a grain of sand ( if this claim is true than it&#x27;s not doing it&#x27;s job very well) - Has a pivoting head that adapts to body contours, is fully washable, has a smartlight and speed personalization. Has two different caps for underarm and legs. Can use wet or dry. It also contains 16 Olay textured wipes to prepare your skin for a gentle epilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall thoughts on this are mixed. It works ok but not optimal. It is loud, painful and i&#x27;m not exactly sure how long the hair will take to grow back. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d throw away my shaver after trying this product. I can&#x27;t say this works better than shaving or using a shaver. I can&#x27;t even say it&#x27;s as good as a shaver possibly. I give it 3 because it works to some extent but i&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It felt more like I was struggling with the unit to remove hair than in control of my hair removal. You could buy it but I can&#x27;t promise you you won&#x27;t feel ripped off.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator and I am in absolute love of it. I used to wax prior to using epilator. So I was able to endure the pain with much ease. However the underarm is still a no no for me. It hurts like hell and waxing is far better when it comes to underarms. After I got it from a near by store, I was too eager to try it. So I charged it for less than half an hour . I was able to finish off full legs and hands in around 45 minutes . There were tiny red spots on my hands after epilation. I put good amount of moisturizer . The morning when I woke up I was loving the feel on my hands..They were so smooth with results very comparable to that of waxing.</li>
    <li> I have fair SENSITIVE skin and dark hair, corse hair.  Shaving leaves my skin smooth for a few hours and then back to me feeling prickily.  I&#x27;ve tried veet cream hair removal which works well on my arms, but irritates my legs.  I also have tried MOOM, which worked well on my sister&#x27;s legs but didn&#x27;t seem to grap my corse hair and left my skin irritated as I had to go over the same area again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go ahead and get an epilator because none of the other methods were working.  First I got a cheap one at the drug store which hardly did anything and decided to look up reviews and get a nice one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator DOES ITS JOB!  However, it is painful the first time you use it. (I&#x27;ve only used it once but I hear it gets much less painful).  It may be my corse hair or low pain tolerance, but it was awful. My hair was longer than it needed to be so that may have added to the pain factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I found the best method for me was to use a bag of ice to place on each area for a minute before I used the epilator.  All and all it took me a 2 days to be fully epilated because I only did a little bit at a time.  My skin got VERY irritated right afterwards but it did go away overnight.  I also used oil from Clean &amp; Easy that calmed my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to get the Braun epilator with the venus shaver attachment but instead went over the area afterwards with a razor to get my skin super smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that your hair grows in cycles so regrowth is hair that hasn&#x27;t been epilated yet.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this method of hair removal if you&#x27;re like me with corse hair that grows back super quick.  I woke up this morning in amazement of smooth legs!</li>
    <li> I LOVE This! I have had this epilator for about two years now and it still works perfectly! the sound that comes from it is a bit loud but I guess it keeps me distracted when I am working it. It also has this small flashlight that makes things easier to look at. It is my first one and I am very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I like to invest in my products. I thought upgrading to a more expensive braun would help cut time and do the job faster.&lt;br /&gt;I was so upset because the tweezers don&#x27;t pull the hair out of its pores, instead it breaks it. Also, I cant use it on certain areas like my&lt;br /&gt;armpits because twice in a row it grabbed a chunk of my skin. I had to turn it off and pull it out. It was bleeding. It wasn&#x27;t working when i tried to turn it on, i plugged it into the charger for an hour until it started functioning again. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to any one else.</li>
    <li> I have had 2 silk epil&#x27;s and one emjoi.  I have found this one to be the most effective so far.  The rotating head is a big plus, especially for the knees.  This is not the greatest for underarms, but good for legs.</li>
    <li> Hells bells, if I was to design a torture device, more relentlessly painful than this, which can lock a more viciously powerful grip upon your tender dainty parts, and yank them with an occasional spray of blood, I could not do so.  Braun should stick to overpriced coffee makers and electric razors, burn the factory to the ground that makes these, and never look back upon this hideous and unspeakable hair extractor.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using an epilator as I normally wax my legs. This product worked like a charm. The pain was much less than waxing, just a little discomfort. To me the discomfort while using the epilator is much better than the sting from cutting myself with a razor.  This particular model is focused for use on the legs and you can buy different attachments for the bikini area, underarms, etc. Being cordless made this extremely easy to use and easier to maneuver to ensure total hair removal.  It charges to full in under an hour and I was able to use mine 3 times (about 90 minutes total) on the first charge.</li>
    <li> Unsatisfied&lt;br /&gt;Broken down in less than a year, customer service very irresponsible I had to ship it on my own to them and pay for maintenance&lt;br /&gt;Expected Braun products to be more reliable</li>
    <li> I turned the epilator on and quickly turned it off. Oh it sounded scary. My bf bravely stuck his arm out as a tester. His eyes lit up and he left the room. As soon as I touched it to my lower leg I thought YOWZA this is going back. I walked away and googled \\&quot;epilator deaths\\&quot; and there were none so I decided to give it another try.  Long story short I didn&#x27;t throw in the towel and kept trying. I did a little bit on one leg and left it overnight to see how it went. I did get some red bumps but the went away quickly  I was quite anxious the next day to try it in the shower and finished my leg. I can&#x27;t say that using the epilator in the shower hurt more or less, but I prefer to do my legs dry. Like some other users I am unsure whether or not the wipes helped.  I did put the wipe in a Baggie so it wouldn&#x27;t dry out and I put it in the fridge so it was cold. It felt good on my leg.  After completing my leg I wasn&#x27;t quite happy with the smoothness, however I understand that the hair grows in cycles so I have no problem doing it several times. I am now 5 days in and am delighted with the results. I experimented with different techniques and realized that when starting small strokes worked best, after that I used circular motions. When I was pain free with the roller attachment I switched to the high efficiency attachment. I also feel that the higher speed is less painful. Day 2 I committed to doing my second leg until the battery died. Of course this was another fresh start so it was a bit painful. I was praying for the battery to die but it lasted quite a while.  I took a day off after doing both legs and then went after the next cycle of new hairs. There was not much visible but I was still picking up hairs. It was at this point that I realized just how far under the skin the hair is.  You&#x27;re certainly not going to get your legs smooth with one pass. I have sat in front of the tv a few times this week and ran the epilator over my legs and they are  now very smooth. I loveit and the discomfort is bearable once I got the hang of it. Also, I have done the WHOLE leg up to the bikini.  The light is a fantastic feature as it lets you see if there are any noticeable hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ARMPITS - ok so my legs went well so I decided to try my armpits in the shower. I was petrified. I soaped them up and it was actually a breeze. I was surprised after reading some reviews. I wasn&#x27;t going to try the pits but I really want to become razor free.  It really didn&#x27;t hurt much and I&#x27;m soooooo happy I tried it. They are so smooth and no black spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also touched it to my upper lip and while it wasn&#x27;t pleasant it was quick and I&#x27;ll likely continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done a lot of research so I understand the process. I have made the commitment and am very happy so far.  I am hoping that future uses won&#x27;t be as involved.  I highly recommend this epilator and I&#x27;ve always considered myself a wimp. Makes me feel like a greater woman. Lol</li>
    <li> I am a seasoned epilator, and thought I&#x27;d share my experience for those who are debating which epilator to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that using an epilator WILL HURT the first few times, but after a while, you become so accustomed that you no longer feel pain, but rather a slight discomfort. As a frame of reference, I epilate my legs, arms and am pretty adventurous with the bikini line (I use it for a Brazilian - which is why I own 3 epilators, one is for my nether region only, and I clean it with alcohol after each use. I especially recommend you do this as well if you plan to do your bikini area and other body parts with the same epilator). For some reason I can&#x27;t stand the sensation on my armpits - IT REALLY HURTS! I also don&#x27;t feel the need to use it on my face, but I don&#x27;t think it should be too uncomfortable. Also, epilating will not leave you as smooth as shaving, but it is pretty darn great because you will only have to do it once a month (after the first 4 weeks which you should do it once a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOW, HOW DOES Braun&#x27;s SE 7181 WD Silk Epil 7 Epilator compare to [[ASIN:B001GS6OB4 Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* ****** IF YOUR ARE NEW TO EPILATING -&gt; I DO VERY MUCH LIKE the \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; attachemnt the Braun has (the emjoi does NOT have any attachments). When you are a first time epilator, the rolling beads give you a different sentation and therefore \\&quot;distract\\&quot; your skin so you don&#x27;t seem to feel the yanking of your hairs quite as terribly. BUT REALLY, IF YOU ARE A FIRST TIMER, IT WILL HURT at least the 1st 5 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I have taken the Bruan Epil 7 Epilator into the shower (because it is completely water proof, which the emjoi is NOT), and it really feels the same as dry epilating. Maybe I felt less discomfort with the warm water, but honestly speaking, it takes 20 minutes to epilate my legs and, I am not taking a 20 minute shower! So, to me, it is not a critical feature. In addition, because of the lighting in the shower is not as \\&quot;bright\\&quot;, (you know the dim over head light we all have so if you are there with your husband your wobbly bits are not so obvious), I miss quite a few of the hairs on my body. So again, for me, it is not the best place for epilating. I never tried it in the bath, but in the bath the last thing I want to do is epilate. A bath serves 2 purposes: Read and cleanse yourself or invite a significant other to join you. Neither which includes the epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* the Emjoy does not have the little light the Braun has, which can be useful in certain areas, but this is not critical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I have always used both epilators at top speed and the Braun seems faster to me, but again not a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Here is where the emjoi wins: the 72 tweezers vs. the 40 (the Braun silk Epil 7 only has 40) does make it faster because I am yanking hair from a larger area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** IMPORTANT ****** Lastly, my Braun&#x27;s battery fried after 6 months of use. WHICH REALLY STINKS! That is why I would recommend getting an epilator that has an electrical cord. I also own a remington that can be used while plugged in, and this one is about 5 years old (and yes, it still works). The Braun (liked above) I had purchased can ONLY be used after it has been charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall recommendation is that if you are not willing to purchase the top of the line Braun Silk Epil 7 which can be used while charging, then buy the emjoi because all the other one&#x27;s will last you 6 months to a year if you use it as heavily as I do. I gave this epilator 3 stars, because it has the light, the massaging head and it is fully water proof.  However the battery does dies and it makes it worthless since it can&#x27;t be used with the electrical plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps steer you in the right direction.</li>
    <li> Have had this for a few years and it&#x27;s still going strong. I love this thing. Still use it dry for my armpits and my legs. The pain and discomfort is near zero after you get used to it. Worth the money, no more shaving in those regions for me ever again. My legs and my armpits have never looked so clean.</li>
    <li> I am not finding this good.. Have been suffering from in growths through out my skin.. With time black patches have formed in my skin.. Whenever I used this.. For a day those patches were reddish n then gone.. But slowly am finding that all those patches have turned black..&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks terrible..&lt;br /&gt;I had clear skin earlier..&lt;br /&gt;Update -&lt;br /&gt;Horrible epilator</li>
    <li> Bought the Braun SE 7181 for my daughter for Christmas. I placed my order pretty late and seller manage managed to send out on time for Christmas. My package was in great condition when received. I highly recommend to friends and family. Epilator seems well made.</li>
    <li> I have previously used epilators by Emjoi, Panasonic, Philips, Remington, and Braun. I personally prefer the wet/dry epilators because they are much less painful in the shower, with much less irritation. It&#x27;s also nice being able to get all of your \\&quot;grooming\\&quot; done in the shower. My previous wet/dry epilator was a [[ASIN:B000F4USEY Panasonic ES2045P Wet/Dry Two-Speed Epilator with Three Heads (Pink)]] and this epilator worked really well on the underarms and the charge lasted a long time. The problem with it was that it caused severe ingrown hairs on my legs, making it basically useless. I started using a Philips epilator which works well, but wasn&#x27;t wet/dry. I ordered this one, thinking I was going to able to use my epilator in the shower again finally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this epilator has not met my expectations. I have no idea why Braun epilators have such a good reputation and are so expensive. In my experience they are not the best. Here are the bad points:&lt;br /&gt;1. The charge is ridiculous. It does not last long at all before I start to see the red warning light. My other epilators lasted way longer. It also takes only an hour to charge fully. Although that *sounds* like it would be a good thing, I think this just makes it so that the battery itself doesn&#x27;t last long. I&#x27;d rather have a battery that had to charge for 6-12 hours and actually *lasted* before it needed to be recharged.&lt;br /&gt;2. For some reason it gives me terrible ingrown hairs on my underarms. The point of using an epilator is so that your skin looks smooth, but with this one my underarms end up looking terrible.&lt;br /&gt;3. It doesn&#x27;t grab the hair very well when wet. I use body wash and it helps, but it still takes much longer to do my underarms than with my previous Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;4.Braun chose to change their epilator design to this longer version with the tweezers more to the side rather than on top like other epilators. In my opinion this was a change for the worse, it&#x27;s not easier to holdand the design of the tweezers on the side seems to make it not pick up hairs properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting so many ingrown hairs on my underarms, I decided to try my [[ASIN:B005BOQHB6 Philips HP6576/60 Satin Perfect Epilator, White/Gold]] again and there is no comparison. The Philips takes less than half the time and you don&#x27;t have to go over the area over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one good point about this epilator is that it works well on my legs. I haven&#x27;t had any problem with ingrown hairs there. Although it is not nearly as fast as the Philips. It is frustrating that it&#x27;s impossible to find an epilator that works well on both legs and underarms and is wet/dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for 3months, and found that it work beautifully for select areas but are horrible for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good for the thicker, denser hairs - the armpit and bikini areas. Of course it hurts at first, but your body will desensitize the pain with regular use, and now it doesn&#x27;t hurt much. I use it once every week or so, once hair has grown back (keep in mind your hair grows at different rates, so a different population will poke up first then the remaining will later). I&#x27;m glad I spent more on this waterproof, cordless model - I epilate under running hot water and it takes away the pain very well (make sure you stretch the skin taunt too). It&#x27;s incredibly fast, you&#x27;re done within minutes. It gives a very smooth, clean finish, more effective than when I got waxing done at a salon! I don&#x27;t have to go back to tweeze anything. The first few times I used it, my skin was red and irritated for a few hours after - but now there&#x27;s no irritation/redness at all. My favorite part is that the shadow under the armpits (when you shave) goes away when I epilate! Before I was very conscious about raising my arms, not now! Probably because the hair root under the skin is pulled out. The hair grows back much thinner and softer there too. As for the bikini area, I advanced into it time after time. I usually epilate upper half, and then shave the sensitive parts. The shaved part will grow within a couple days, the epilated part won&#x27;t grow until a week or more later. I think I will stick to that routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not good for fine hair - legs and arms. I&#x27;ve tried this several times. Sometimes shaving to exfoliate in between, or using salicylic acid to prevent bumps after. But it doesn&#x27;t work, at least not on me. I get lots of pink little bumps and so many ingrown hair on my legs everytime. Additionally, the epilator is quite fast and powerful - for a lot of the leg hairs, it cuts it at the surface (like jagged shaving) instead of pulling it out by the root. Notto mention that it hardly pulls any arm hair out. I think the hairs are too thin for the epilator. I have normal thickness leg and arm hair though, if not thicker than average!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, its efficiency in the armpit &amp; bikini areas are well worth the cost. Even if you don&#x27;t plan on touching the bikini area, I would still recommend it for the armpits - beats shaving so often! Can&#x27;t say enough good things there. BUT if you&#x27;re looking at this product to use on your legs and/or arms, you might want to look at other options. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this is just how I found the product to work for me. It can be a different experience for you! Oh, and the battery life is AMAZING! I charged it fully when I received it in September. After using it every week, it lasted 2 whole months without recharging. Wow!</li>
    <li> I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its less painful if you epilate under water,and does less noise also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product!!</li>
    <li> Its very painful... do not recommend it for anyone! Word word Word word Word word Word word Word word Word word</li>
    <li> I have purchased the product 2 times and both lasted only 6 months. I do not use much often because I prefer waxing.</li>
    <li> I deliberately waited for several months before writing a review for this product. The reason was that I owned the exact same epilator before and it all of a sudden stopped functioning. I could not figure out the reason but suspected that it could have been due to dropping it on tiles in my bathroom. I risked and bought the time again and this one has been working perfectly so far. I love that I can use it under running water. Also, I travel a lot and the fact that I can charge it and do not have to worry about adapters and different voltages, is nice.</li>
    <li> This epilator is so much better than the Emoji one I had and gave up on.  Something I really appreciate is that the hair gets contained in the head so it doesn&#x27;t get everywhere while your epilating.  Yes, the light is actually amazingly useful, who would have thought?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback I&#x27;ve found, and I think has been stated, is that you cannot use the epilator while it is plugged in.  This makes me worry about when the battery potentially dies, but at the moment, it means that I can&#x27;t keep going if the battery runs out on me.  My previous epilators allowed you to plug in and keep going, but not this one.  We&#x27;ll see....</li>
    <li> I was very happy in the beginning when I got this. I used to have the more basic models that stopped working after 2 years. But I am disappointed with this one. Less than a year it is not running well anymore. It runs out of battery so fast and has slowed down spinning.</li>
    <li> It is very good it hurts the first time but the second time it&#x27;s fine it&#x27;s easy to use the fact u can use it in the shower is fun!!! Like it very mic never shaving again ;)</li>
    <li> Battery dies after a year. Customer service is no help. My boyfriend can fix almost anything, so he took it apart for me, and I can tell you, your average gal won&#x27;t be able to do it because it&#x27;s not that easy unless you&#x27;re handy and have a special screwdriver (not a philips or flathead). You can also break it if you&#x27;re not super careful because it&#x27;s not that easy to get open. Anyway,the battery is weak and guess what? Go try to find a replacement battery! Good luck because they&#x27;re on backorder and hard to find online.&lt;br /&gt;So your epilator will be junk and you can go spend another $100 or $175 on a new one.&lt;br /&gt;And if you&#x27;re not lucky enough to be handy or have a super handy man like my boyfriend, then double good luck because your epilator will be junk. Anyway, some people&#x27;s battery die in 6 months, others a year, and others a year plus. Anyway, I&#x27;m not pleased with this purchase. And most of my amazon reviews are very positive, so I&#x27;m not just a person who whines about everything she buys. Seriously, if the batteries are going to die, Braun should make it easy to replace them on the device, and easy to purchase the batteries. Don&#x27;t bother. Do yourself a favor and purchase another brand of epilator.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t lie, you have to have a decent pain threshold if you&#x27;re using this anywhere other than your lower legs. It&#x27;s so worth it though over the itching and irritation associated with shaving. It does the job. Battery has a long life.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome epilator.  Wish I could find replacement head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used corded epilators before. I thought they&#x27;re more powerful and last longer than rechargebles.  I had an old Braun one for 5 years.  No one was selling my old Braun epilator and that&#x27;s why I looked at this one.  I love it.  I run it on top speed for best performance.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1)The rechargeable battery lasts a long time.  I&#x27;ve gone weeks without a single recharge.&lt;br /&gt;2)It&#x27;s just as powerful as my old corded one&lt;br /&gt;3)I love the light. It&#x27;s bright and I can spot places I&#x27;ve missed.&lt;br /&gt;4)My body has been silky smooth for a week before I notice any hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are really no cons, but I believe people list cons due to their inexperience.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) It hurts: That&#x27;s because they&#x27;ve never used an epilator before.  Well, yes, it hurts more than shaving because shaving just doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  There&#x27;s going to be a certain amount of pain when you are pulling out hair. It hurts a lot less then tweezing and feel similar to waxing. Don&#x27;t let the hair get longer than 1/4 inch before epilating.  Use a scissor and cut it down first. Otherwise you&#x27;ll get hair that&#x27;s broken instead of being pulled out and that hurts.  The longer and thicker the hair, the more painful it&#x27;ll be because like all epilators, it can&#x27;t grab long thick hair well. Reduce that by not letting the hair get so long.  You can also use lidocaine cream before epilating as that will numb the area and help with sensitive areas.  Body parts, legs being least sensitive to armpits to your groin which will be most sensitive. For legs and armpits, follow along the hair pattern. For groin, go perpendicular to the hair for best pick up and least pain. The pain actually decreases as you use it more often and more frequently.  Wet epilating is less painful than dry. I don&#x27;t feel pain, but there&#x27;s apparently a lot of sensitive people out there.  Also once you&#x27;ve epilated a spot, you&#x27;ll notice no pain because no hair is being pulled out from that spot. You can also test how hard you can push the epilator on that spot and notice no pain, no skin grab.  Don&#x27;t be lazy and let the hair grow out so long and then complain it hurts because you didn&#x27;t follow directions.&lt;br /&gt;2)skin grabbing: When epilating, press the rotating part against your skin. Don&#x27;t let it loosely touch your skin.  If you have areas you can easily pinch, that means the skin there is loose.  Pull it taunt before epilating.  Like vacuuming a rug.  If you do not pull the rug taunt, the vacuum will pull the rug into it.  Very few people have loose skin, that&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t hear many complaints about skin pulling.  People get scared and let it lightly touch the skin. That&#x27;s bad because the epilator can&#x27;t grab the hair correctly and will cause pain.&lt;br /&gt;2)I get ingrown hairs: When the hairs are too long or you are not making sure the epilator is on your skin when epilating, you get hair breakage.  Basically the hair is not being completely pulled out.  Instead it&#x27;s broken with the roots still in the body.  So the hair can still grow, but changes it&#x27;s growth pattern. Thus you get ingrown hair. Solution for it again is to cut the hair short to 1/4 inch before epilating. Also make sure the epilator is pressing on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;3)I&#x27;m breaking out in the areas I&#x27;ve epilated: You need to make sure the area is clean before epilating.  Best after soaping during a shower or just after a shower.  If it&#x27;s not clean, bacteria, dirt, and other things get in the areas where the hair has been removed.&lt;br /&gt;4)Poor battery life: I&#x27;ve had my epilator for a year now, no problems.  Could be a manufacturer defect if it dies before a year. Prolong your battery life by letting it die before doing a full charge.  Don&#x27;t half charge, use it, half charge.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> This is really a fantastic epilator.  Although the head is a little smaller than the Emoji I&#x27;ve been using, the Braun Silk-Epil works faster and picks up more hair, which is a win in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR STARTERS, it looks sleek and feminine.  I sort of wish it had a charging stand, but I suppose it would be strange to have one&#x27;s hair removal device on display for company.  In addition, this little epilator has a nice weight to it and is countoured to fit your hand nicely.  It sounds a little silly to be reviewing an epilator as one would a hundred-dollar kitchen knife, but when you&#x27;re holding this for an extended epilation session, you&#x27;ll be glad it&#x27;s so nicely designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAIR REMOVAL is fast and efficient.  The pivoting head picks up the tiniest bit of stubble (think 1-2 days after shaving for most of us) and pulls the hair out by the root.  You&#x27;ll be amazed at how much work the epilator actually did when you take the head off to clean it!  This can be submerged in water and used wet or dry.  Though I prefer to do dry epilation myself, it&#x27;s nice to be able to run the head under the faucet to clean out stray hairs quickly.  Of course, as with all epilators, be sure not to use any creams or oils on your skin until AFTER you&#x27;re done epilating, even if you&#x27;re going to use it in the shower or tub.  You don&#x27;t want that getting into the epilator head and gunking up the works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT HAS THOUGHTFUL TOUCHES, too, like the massaging attachment head and the bright spotlight for finding missed hairs.  Yes, the massaging head actually does massage.  If you don&#x27;t believe me, try out the plain white head to feel the difference.  The spotlight is actually ingenious, and it does work for finding those little stray hairs you wouldn&#x27;t otherwise see, even in a well-lit room.  The included brush to clean the epilator works nicely, but I always seem to lose these things.  I do wish they had thought to put a compartment in the actual epilator to hold this brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY ONLY CONCERN is that the battery may eventually wear out and not be able to hold a charge.  Since this is a rechargeable device, it can&#x27;t be run with the power cord attached.  So if the battery goes kaput, so will the epilator.  Obviously I can&#x27;t speak to how many charges this device will hold, so I can&#x27;t take off any stars for that.  If you want it to last longer however, you&#x27;ll want to deplete the charge fully every once in a while before recharging it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU&#x27;RE NEW TO EPILATION, expect some initial pain during the removal process.  There&#x27;s just no way around it outside of a glass of wine or some ibuprofen.  You&#x27;ll need to epilate every few days at first if you&#x27;re a shaver--waxers should be able to switch over with ease.  Here&#x27;s why:  human hair grows in cycles--of the millions of hair follicles on your legs, some are active and some are not.  To complicate matters more, of the active ones, they&#x27;re all in different stages of growth--which means some will hurt like the dickens when you pull them out by the roots, while others will come out willingly with little to no pain.  The only solution to this is to power through and continue epilating regularly.  Eventually you&#x27;ll only be pulling out the same set of hairs from active follicles, and it will hurt a lot less (but it will still hurt, sorry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU&#x27;RE BRAVE enough to try bikini/underarm epilation, try the [[ASIN:B0016GTOHC Braun SE7781 Silk-Epil Xpressive Epilator Body System, Rechargeable]], which comes with the underarm/bikini trimmer cap and a shaving foil.he battery may eventually wear out and not be able to hold a charge.

    <li> QUICK SUMMARY:  \\&quot;Epilating\\&quot; was not in my wife&#x27;s vocabulary until we got the Braun Epilator Xpressive Pro.  \\&quot;Shaving\\&quot; is what my wife will continue doing even though we have an epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background:  Suppose you&#x27;re a husband wondering what to get your wife for that upcoming gift-giving occasion.  As you stroll helplessly through the mall, somehow you find yourself looking at personal grooming electronics (hey, it could happen!).  And you see this Braun black box with some model&#x27;s gorgeous legs on it, and you don&#x27;t even know what an epilator is, but you think to yourself, \\&quot;Wow, if my wife can have legs like that model&#x27;s, she&#x27;ll be forever grateful to me!\\&quot; And so you snap up an epilator, take it home, and wait for the big day to proudly and excitedly give it to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reality:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your wife (assuming she shaves her legs) will look at your present the way she might if you gave her a small Tasmanian Devil with sharp teeth.  Yes, an epilator, you poor foolish husband, yanks out the hair from your wife&#x27;s legs -- ostensibly so she doesn&#x27;t have to shave as often (a worthy goal, that).  As your wife reads through the instruction manual, she keeps looking up at you, sees your eager eyes, shakes her head, then drops head back down to read some more...this thing is for legs only...can be used wet or dry...best used in the evenings....  And because your wife loves you, she agrees to give it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilator is nicely balanced and shaped like a regular razor.  This should be easy and fun! (You think).  It&#x27;s time to get started...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we follow the instructions and start the epilation process in the evening.  Why in the evening?  Because, by the time my wife is done epilating, her legs won&#x27;t look like those model&#x27;s legs on the box packaging.  Instead, they will look red, irritated and splotchy like she&#x27;s had a nasty psoriasis outbreak.  Your wife, like mine, can now look at her freshly epilated legs in horror.  You can try comforting her by saying no one can see her legs at night anyway, and why don&#x27;t you and she just retire for the evening now?  Your wife will then throw a pillow at your face (lucky it was just a pillow and not the epilator).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q.  Does the epilation process hurt?&lt;br /&gt;A.  It didn&#x27;t hurt me at all! (Kidding)  Seriously, it&#x27;s no worse than watching your wife going through childbirth without an epidural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q.  Is the epilation process effective?&lt;br /&gt;A.  Yes, as long as your wife doesn&#x27;t have knees, because my wife&#x27;s knees remained a little stubbly no matter how hard she tries epilating over her kneecaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q.  William, does your wife&#x27;s legs stay smoother longer now?&lt;br /&gt;A.  I don&#x27;t know; my wife no longer lets me touch her legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q.  My wife epilated last night, but she reports that her legs are still senstive the next morning.  What should I do?&lt;br /&gt;A.  Take her to the beach and get her sunburned so she no longer can blame the sensitivity on the new epilator you got for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q.  The instruction manual recommends epilating when leg hair is 2-5mm long?  How long is that, really?&lt;br /&gt;A.  Long enough to make people say \\&quot;Yikes!\\&quot; and/or mistake you for a European tourist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  The leggy model who posed for the Braun packaging material is probably single and she probably shaves her legs.omforting her by saying no one can see her legs at night anyway, and why don&#x27;t you and she just retire for the evening now?

    <li> In what may be the shortest review on Amazon, I will quote my friend for whom I bought this little gadget - \\&quot;ouch, send it back\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She would rather go back to shaving.  The high speed whirring tweezers do a fine job of ripping the hair out by the roots, but the pain was unbearable.  According to her, the legs hurt a little less than the bikini lines, but neither was worth the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the razor or maybe find a laser, but the epilator was a bust for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still giving the product three stars because it&#x27;s not a problem with the device.  It works as advertised.  I&#x27;m sure that many women may find this method of hair removal too painful.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a well working Braun Silkepil.  The reason I was attracted to this model was because it was cordless and had the light. Unfortunately, it left the skin on my legs itchy and dry and caused red bumps. I also I noticed I have gotten ingrown hairs.  After paying $100 for it, it is unfortunate I will not use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My older Braun Silkepil removes hairs much better and it looks like the quality has gone down with the new product.</li>
    <li> I bought my first braun epilator a while ago, worked very well but I had more leg than the epilator had battery. To make things easier I bought another epilator to help remove all the leg hair in one quick session. I was a very hairy guy but now I am smooth and happy.</li>
    <li> stopped working in less than a month&lt;br /&gt;stopped working in less than a month&lt;br /&gt;stopped working in less than a month&lt;br /&gt;stopped working in less than a month</li>
    <li> easy to use and clean, and gets the shortest hair! so you can still get smooth 2 days after you shaved! great buy</li>
    <li> From my wife Sarah: The Braun Silk epil 7 did the trick. I got smooth legs. The following are the pros and cons as I see it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I got a very smooth \\&quot;shave\\&quot;, and since it pulls the hairs out from the roots, it should last longer than a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No cuts or scrapes from a razor. Honestly I almost always cut myself shaving my legs. This was a big plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You can use it dry. This was really convenient and less time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I could use it in a comfortable position. I just sat comfortably on my bed, and with some back problems I&#x27;m dealing with, I found this to be physically much easier than shaving my legs in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I can&#x27;t recommend the wipes that are included in the kit. Here&#x27;s why: The ingredients reads like a chemical plant product list. In fact there&#x27;s even vinyl (with some other chemical names following it that I don&#x27;t recognize), and there&#x27;s no possible way I&#x27;ll put that on my skin. Remember that what you put on your skin can be absorbed into your system. Also there&#x27;s a fragrance on the wipes, and those who need fragrance free products won&#x27;t be able to use this. Lastly, if you plan to use the wipes, you&#x27;ll need to keep buying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Pain. It did hurt. The unit pulls your hair out, so it&#x27;s not for the squeamish. Maybe it would be less painful if I used the wipes, but that&#x27;s not going to happen and I can&#x27;t recommend that. I think how much it hurts would depend on your hair. Mine is quite fine, so I think if you have thicker hair follicles, it will hurt even more. Was it tolerable? Yes, for me it was. And I will use the product again because of the positives. Also the directions say that with repeated use the pain diminishes, so I&#x27;ll give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The directions are unclear. I had questions they didn&#x27;t answer well, but I was able to figure it out on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The directions are a bit on the scary side. They state that the effects of using the product can be skin irritation, and penetration of bacteria causing inflammation. They give warnings to people with the following conditions saying that you need your doctor&#x27;s approval to use the device if you have: eczema, wounds, inflamed skin reactions such as folliculitis, varicose veins, reduced immunity of the skin such as with diabetes, mellitus, during pregnancy, Reynaud&#x27;s disease, hemophilia, Candida or immune deficiency. You should not use it around moles. This is all sort of daunting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To conclude, I think this product does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and for me it&#x27;s worth the discomfort. I plan to use it. Can I recommend it to others? If you don&#x27;t mind the cons listed above, than it could be a good product for you.eria causing inflammation.

    <li> This is my 2nd epilator, first was a CHEAP Remington, which would sometimes rip hairs from the root or rip only half the hair. So after doing some research, I decided to invest in a better quality model. This works very well for underarm hair and for leg hair. I&#x27;m pretty pain tolerant but don&#x27;t go anywhere near the \\&quot;lady garden\\&quot; with this epilator model or there will be much pain and maybe even some blood. This is not because of the product but due to the sensitive area, and how the Braun SE 7181 forcefully rips the hairs from the root. As an alternative, I snap on the trimmer blade to trim those more sensitive areas. The smartlight has to be my most favorite feature because I was able to find the finest and shortest hairs.      IMPORTANT INFO: 1.) The trimmer/shaver head does not come in the box and I had to order online for an additional $39. (2.) This epilator works cordless only so if you are slow like myself you will have to allow it to charge and then come back to finish the job, which is why I gave it 4 stars. (3.) The Olay wipes help this epilator glide smoothly along the skin; however, these wipes are expensive and cost $19 to reorder. (4.) If you have coarse hair, take a shower, dry off then use your epilator...I tried using it in the shower on my underarms and it really didn&#x27;t work well with my wet coarse underarm hair.  (5.) You can use it anywhere in the house because the hair is deposited under the changeable heads unlike my cheap Remington epilator. (6.) Apply medicated No Bump Zone Gel to soothe skin after depilating those sensitive hair bump prone areas...underarm &amp; bikini. (7.) Lastly, I noticed that taking a really warm shower before and after made a world of difference with pain; likewise, I applied a moisturizing natural lotion to my legs after I depilated and showered. My legs turned out baby soft!</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the thing, genetically I don&#x27;t have hairy legs so instead I used this epilator on my hairy arms. I never shave my arms because I don&#x27;t see the point but I wanted to be a good sport and test this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I find is, like with shaving, this will depend on your personal body&#x27;s hair growth. In the 1st week of May, I shaved a patch out of one arm and I epilated a patch out of the other to compare. The shaved arm started growing back in 3 weeks and the epilated arm is just starting to grow back 5 weeks later. I&#x27;m satisfied, but the hair is growing in really choppy. My arm hair is smooth and flat, but this hair is growing back like spikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain wise, I&#x27;ve had much worse. It tickled to me. I am very ticklish but who knew my arms were ticklish lol. The epilator kind of vibrates so it didn&#x27;t hurt me at all. That&#x27;s on my arm so I don&#x27;t know about other parts of the body. If you&#x27;ve never experienced physical pain, this will probably hurt a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I probably won&#x27;t use this again because I don&#x27;t mind my arm hair. But it is nice and removes several hairs at once. And for me, it lasted 2 weeks longer than shaving so that&#x27;s cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m black if that matters because my white coworker told me black and white people grow hair differently...is that true? If so, maybe my hair growth is slow...</li>
    <li> When my husband saw this charging by the bathroom sink, he asked me what was that thing, it looked like some kind of torture devise. I didn&#x27;t realize how right he was. I&#x27;ve never used an Epilator device before, so maybe someone who is used to this brand of products would have a different opinion about this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feeling was that wet would be more bearable, so I didn&#x27;t even try to dry shave. I started with my leg, and while I wouldn&#x27;t call it comfortable, it wasn&#x27;t so bad. It definitely took longer than a regular razor, but I think it will be quicker as I get more accustomed to the Epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I moved to my underarms, and that&#x27;s where things started to get sketchy. So you know how there is something alarming and a bit disconcerting about the sound a dentist&#x27;s drill makes? The Epilator gave me that same sensation as I moved it closer to my underarms. The only difference is that my underarms were not numbed with novacane. I have no doubt that many women use this tourture devise on their underarms and bikini line, I will never be one of those women. I think that the U.S. military could start using the Epilator as an alternative to water boarding. If their underarms don&#x27;t get them to talk, their bikini line will.</li>
    <li> Ow, ow, ow! OK, I&#x27;ll admit it. I had fantasies that this unit would somehow make epilation less painful. I tried it once when I was a teenager and quickly gave up because of the pain. I didn&#x27;t try it again for years, until this unit came along. I have lots of coarse hair on my legs and get sick of shaving them, especially in the summer time. Shaving less frequently had great appeal to me. So I applied the matching wipes to my legs, took a deep breath and took the plunge again. Nope. Having hairs ripped out is no more fun and no less painful than it ever was. I hung on as long as I could, then stopped. Tried it again a week later. Same thing. Sigh. I cannot even *imagine* trying this on the bikini or underarm area. Nope. Ain&#x27;t gonna happen to this girl. I know, I know. Everything I have read says to hang in there and eventually it will get better. But the idea of inflicting pain that bad on myself is just not appealing to me. I will say that for a day or so, the areas that were epilated did look very nice. But it&#x27;s just not worth it to me. I will say that I think the manufacturer is being a tad disingenuous when their ad claims the unit \\&quot;gently\\&quot; removes hair at the root and the unit \\&quot;maximizes skin comfort\\&quot;. I suppose that compared to a blowtorch, this unit does maximize comfort. But compared to shaving with a razor, um, no.</li>
    <li> This is a good product from a good reliable brand. It is not painful due to the massaging tip it has, very efficient and a good bargain for it&#x27;s price. If you can afford to pay more buy the newer model though.. has a lot of advantages such as rechargeable battery and water proof option..</li>
    <li> This works well, but you do have to get used to it, and there are a few steps to follow for it to work really well, and be relatively pain free...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PREPARATION:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Trim hair with electric hair clippers to about 1/4 inch.&lt;br /&gt;2.  After trimming, clean the area with hot water, as hot as you can safely stand it.  This will open and loosen follicles.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Let dry, and then start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The Pivoting head is great for curved areas.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Smart Light helps to find hairs in a room that is not lit well.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Two Speeds - Soft and Fast.  This helps get used to it, before advancing to the Faster Speed.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Fully Washable.  And it actually Is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> It seems to remove hair alright, but I find that even when i go over everthing a million times, I still see peach fuzzy length hair all over that I can&#x27;t get with the epilator. It does hurt....not as bad as some make it out to be, but it does. I&#x27;m not sure How much I like it, but I will continue to use it. I have noticed that the hair that is growing in is a lot softer and not as noticable, so I&#x27;m willing to give it a shot and see if it&#x27;s one of those things that you have to do for a while for it to really be worth it. It worked like a charm on my forearms though. I was too scared to do it (since it hurt like a mofo) so i zoomed the thing on a high stting over my arms as fast as i could the first time to sort of thin out the hair. After the initial thinning out quick strokes i was able to go over them a lot more slowly to do it right. It wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought.</li>
    <li> I copied this from my old review on makeupalley.  It&#x27;s my cautionary tale about ingrown hairs and epilators. If you have no problems with ingrowns and are used to using an epilator then this is a good one to buy.  It&#x27;s just not for me, sadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had much luck with epilators in the past.  This model works much better than the previous 2 I&#x27;ve had. (I owned the previous model, the braun silk epil). This makes wider passes and catches the hairs better than the previous braun. It&#x27;s also a lot quieter.  Not quiet, but not as horribly noisy as my previous braun.  Much improved as far as noise goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilators are notorious for ingrown hairs, IMO worse than waxing. I make slow passes- as tempting as it is to go faster you&#x27;ll likely break the hair off and cause ingrowns.  I&#x27;ve had this problem with epilators and ingrown hairs before but I decided to give it another try with this model. I&#x27;m going to keep my skin very exfoliated as a precaution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my experience I won&#x27;t even try this in the bikini area. Epilators change the direction of hair growth patterns to a greater degree than waxing and while the problems might not occur right away, eventually the hair is going to be growing back at odd angles and cause permanent problems IMO. If you do try this be very careful and do a test area first. I really advise against it unless you never have any problems with ingrown hairs in this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update-  Sadly, after using this, again with the ingrown problem. I have some ingrown hairs even though I exfoliate all the time and keep my skin very smooth. Not a lot, but even a few really look bad now that it&#x27;s summer.  I&#x27;m not taking off any stars because as epilators go it&#x27;s really good. I might just be more prone to ingrowns than other people</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this purchase - no complains till it stopped working after about 8-9 months. Must have used it about 10-15 times. No matter how much i plug in,  the battery fails to charge. Disappointed with durability.</li>
    <li> This is my first Epilator, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months and wanted to wait before reviewing it to form my opinions.  First a little about my hair and WHY I&#x27;ve wanted to try this, because it does sound insane to want to rip your hair out one by one.  I get TERRIBLE razor burn under my arms.  Shaving more than once a week was really painful and so I rarely did it.  I could alleviate the problem by waxing, which removed about 50% of the hair, so I could shave more frequently.  My legs aren&#x27;t really a problem, most of the hair on them is relatively fine and shaving never bothered me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first use of this epilator was on my legs, and I used it dry.  It stung a bit but was not bad at all.  Heartened, I tested it on my underarms.  Oh. My. God.  I have delivered two children without benefit of medication, it&#x27;s a different kind of pain, but this definitely brought tears to my eyes in an unexpected way.  A way unequaled by waxing or plucking or flaying.  Needless to say I did not continue that round.  On another brave day, I tried it again, but this time in the shower and it made a world of difference.  It hurt, but it was bearable.  After the first session, it was never more that mildly uncomfortable...  I attribute this to the fact that only SOME of the hairs grow back at any one time so a much smaller number of hairs are being pulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this on my underarms has changed my life (maybe overly dramatic), but I feel like I can wear whatever shirts I want whenever I want and don&#x27;t have to plan three days ahead to make sure I can have freshly shaven armpits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My leg hair has been a little more complicated.  Because some/most of my hair is fine, I think the pluckers have some trouble grabbing them.  The darker and thicker hair seems to get grabbed well enough.  I&#x27;m not sure what percentage of hair is just getting broken off and what percent are being pulled, but I know that if I do this once a week or so my legs are smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Take home:  The LED light is helpful, the machine is not so loud that I can&#x27;t use it while my kid sleeps in an adjacent room, a charge lasts long enough for me to do my legs twice, it charges in less than 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m never going back to shaving or waxing.  LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> This is my second epilator. My first, by Remington, worked well for a couple years then attempted to suck in and devour a chunk of my flesh before dying on me. This epilator is easy to grip, has a helpful built-in light, is easier to clean than my previous epilator, and is not too painful. It hurt a little the first couple of times I used it, but now my nerves seem to have become accustomed to the sensation of hair being pulled out and it only stings in really sensitive areas, such as the thin skin around my ankles. I even used it in my armpits and was only mildly traumatized, nothing that a drink and some swearing to myself couldn&#x27;t handle! It is awesome to not have to worry about shaving every day and so far it has not attempted to eat my flesh.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;Nice epilator, with flexible head.&lt;br /&gt;It works just fine. I charged it once and have already used it twice (about 20min) without having to charge it again.&lt;br /&gt;Nice colors.</li>
    <li> I tried my sister&#x27;s first to see if i would like it - I did - so i bought my own.  The first time i used it on my arms and they stayed smooth for over a week (i don&#x27;t have tons of hair on my arms).  Yes, it does hurt a little - but no more so than waxing.  The second time i used it on my arms (did not hurt as much) and then on my under arms. To me the under arms were a little more painful - but as with waxing the pain lessens with each time.  As i am blessed with many chin hairs (no one tells you this when you are 20 that by the time you are 52 you get hair on your chin!!!) - so i loved it for this.  I&#x27;m dying to try it on my legs next.  So glad i got this.  Great product.  Again, can&#x27;t believe i waited so long to buy and epilator!!!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I am kicking myself for waiting all these years to try it. Yes, its a little painful at first but so worth it. I used this on my underarms 5 days ago and still not a hair in sight. I used to shave everyday! I no longer have to waste my hot water in the shower. I can sit in my livingroom floor and shave while I watch tv. It seemed a little pricey but after years of spending $15 for a three pack of my old razor blades it will pay for itself in 6 mo. I don&#x27;t think I will ever shave with a razor again.</li>
    <li> This review is for my first Braun Epilator, I have been using it for two months now. Yes it would be painful the first time you use it, I could bear it as I was using Remington Epilator for some time now. The results you get after epilation is just awesome. If you are new to epilation, make sure skin is taut and you move it in circular motions in smaller areas. Also take your own sweet time and be patient, if you want good results. The LED is very helpful and is at the right place, so that you dont miss the hairs. Also the messaging system helps a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for legs, arms and underarms and results are awesome. It can easily be used for the curves because of the pivoting head.It really pulls the hairs from the roots and it would be finer the next time it grows.&lt;br /&gt;I love this epilator. :)&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is when I bought it the price was 85$ and it has reduced by 10$ now, but I believe that keeps changing.</li>
    <li> I bought TWO of these - BOTH failed the same way:  it \\&quot;bit\\&quot; me because I wasn&#x27;t holding my skin tight enough, then the motor would not come back on again - ever.  The first time, it was within the 60 day money back guarantee, and I got my money back.  I bought another one, the same thing happened, and it&#x27;s outside the 60 day time frame, so I&#x27;m stuck with getting it \\&quot;repaired\\&quot;.... and I have to buy another one (NOT a BRAUN) today :(</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really care for the wet/dry option because I used mine dry.  With that many more tweezers, I&#x27;ve found it more effective than other epilators I&#x27;ve used, but I still have to do a couple of passes sometimes.  I think the rollers were really helpful because it prevented my skin getting pulled.  A full charge took care of arms and legs in one sitting, but I wished that this had an option of working while being charged.  Overall, it worked better and lasted longer than two Emjoi epilators that I&#x27;ve owned.  The epilator head stopped working after three years and three months.</li>
    <li> Epilators have come a long way over the years. All the tweezers that pull your hair out with only a little pain is a good thing,. The problem is the time it takes to complete the job. Shaving is much faster and is less painful. Sure you may get up 2 weeks before you need to use the epilator again. My experience was only an extra few days of smoothness over shaving.  Those extra few days is not worth the extra time to me.    I would not recommend this to friends and family</li>
    <li> I love this device, the only thing is that it works only on battery, if you plug it in you can&#x27;t use it. Apart from that it&#x27;s working beautifully.</li>
    <li> The Braun SE 7181 is an excellent product!!! It comes ready to use... is small perfect for travelling, my legs are better than ever!!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! I only use it on my legs and armpits, tried bikini area, painful, but worth it. I don&#x27;t think I will be using a razor again.</li>
    <li> First epilator I&#x27;ve purchased and I love it. Stays charged for a long time and is very effective. Best for less-sensitive areas like legs and back; avoid underarm and bikini - ouch.</li>
    <li> Bought this on the recommendation of one of my friends, but have been very displeased with the results. The device is painful to use, takes many passes to extract hair, even when focusing on a small area. Afterwards, I was left with bloody dots all over, and ingrown hairs over the next weeks. I favor Braun products, but this is the exception.</li>
    <li> Much less pain, faster removal, replaced my older model of Braun Silk Epil. I would recommed it. My daughter likes it too.</li>
    <li> I got this as the replacement of my Phillips epilator which I had for over 15 years. I hope to have this for just as long. It seems that built in obsolence did not reach the epilator market back then. So, this one does a nice an fairly painless job and holds the charge quite well neither of which I expected. I can see this coming on a trip with me. This is the barebones version of the machine with all the extensions, and when I learned this, I was worried for a moment and thought I would need to replace it, but you do not need all the fancy heads. I do bikini line and armpits with this very happily and safely. No need to spend the extra $30 for the excess accessories. Does a nice clean job, has a light to see what you are doing, and it is easy to clean. It is fast and relatively paineless. I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Well, I had ordered a non-wet-dry Braun epilator before (Braun SE 5180 Silk Epil 5 Epilator with Ice Glove, Green ).  It was too painful to use. I returned it for the cordless, wet-dry epilator (the one I am currently writing a review on :) ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one was great, I used it in the shower and also dry and it was much better and way less painful, completed both legs below my knees. Yes, it was red and bumpy afterwards but I was able to confront the actual epilating.  Interestingly enough, the slower mode was less painful for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, a few days later, I realized I had a lot of ingrown hair on my legs!  Oops, I guess I will have to exfoliate for a few days or so after epilating. This is all new to me so I just need to get a routine in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still give the machine itself 5 stars because it does the job and with a lot less pain than the dry epilator.  I noticed that epilating in the shower and/or bath is much more effective and less painful, I guess because the heat of the water expands one&#x27;s pores.  However, the next evening I was doing the backs of my legs (did the front in the shower) and I used the pre-epilating towels.  Not sure what that does but I was able to finish the backs of my legs with bearable pain. Whereas, as aforementioned, the earlier epilator (Braun SE 5180 Silk Epil 5 Epilator with Ice Glove, Green) was unbearable to the point where I had to return it (though, it too, did the job).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update as I go along, should I remember. :) But I think I just need to exfoliate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;October 3rd, 2012:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigh.  I am too prone to ingrown hairs to use an epilator.  So I am sending it back. But, if you are an epilator user, I suggest this one; it did the job and did it well, I am just not able to figure out how to handle the ingrown hairs. The product was not defunct; my skin is...</li>
    <li> Finally, I have found a method that takes care of hair removal quickly and with such ease.  Because of stubbles, Ii&#x27;ve always avoided shaving and have resorted to tweezing for years.  I wished I bought this epilator much earlier.  What normally takes up to 40 minutes of tweezing now only takes 5-7 minutes. And best of all, the hair removes clean! I highly recommend this unit for anyone.</li>
    <li> WOW! I just had to search through my years of orders to see when I bought this as, I&#x27;m just now debating whether I need a new epilator or not, a result of only recently loosing the charger to this one. I looked through my orders just now and found I purchased this epilator in 2011! I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s been that long, so I thought I MUST write a review immediately, because this product is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little over 3 years later this model is still going strong, despite my butter fingers! I dropped it multiple times, watched in horror as it skidded across the bathroom tiles &amp; even once crashed down a couple stares. But man has it held up! The only damage all my accidents caused is where the tweezer peace connects to the main epilator body which has understandably become a little loose from the beatings it&#x27;s recieved from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began with waxing my legs &amp; underarms in high school, you&#x27;ll notice the hair thins out after a while, becoming easier to remove. I would&#x27;t recommend getting an epilator if you&#x27;ve been a dedicated shaver for years, you won&#x27;t be happy because it&#x27;ll hurt too much to get any proper hair removal done. Start off waxing and move onto this. After waxing had became quite painless I saw a friend of mine using an epilator, so I decided to get one. I chose this Braun after my first epilator died, which was also able to be used in the water. A VERY helpful feature for people getting used to epilating. Also I wonder if it helps make the product more durable in humid places. This is the first feature I love about this model that you can use it wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly I LOVE the guard, anyone who&#x27;s used an epilator without one knows that your skin can at times get sucked up in there, not a fun thing. The guard really helps with that, although the longer I&#x27;ve owned mine I&#x27;ve noticed my underarm skin gets caught a little more often than it used to. Also the light is very helpful, it&#x27;s perfectly aimed so you can see all the hairs and catch the ones you might easily miss otherwise. I&#x27;ll have to peer very closely in natural light to see what the epilator light illuminates easily. Lastly I love the three speeds, the fastest one is very strong and removes hairs great, it&#x27;s wonderful to be able to adjust the speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery LASTS!!! Oh yes you need to charge it for about  1 1/2 - 2 hours to get it fully charged, but once it&#x27;s charged I feel I get at least 3 -5 good uses out of it and you only need to epilate once every 3 weeks, so it&#x27;s never let me down. You can always tell when it needs a charge because the engine whirrs a lot slower. The little plus light flashes red when it&#x27;s dead and charging once it&#x27;s charged it turns green. :) Everything about this epilator makes me happy, I love the metalic orange color, and did I mention it has classy sparkles on the body?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to clean and they provide cleaning instructions, recommending you brushing the hair out every time after use. Now that I&#x27;ve raved I think I&#x27;m going to have to buy another one, it&#x27;s about time, over 3 years of content use despite mulitple beatings speaks for itself, I feel you&#x27;ll be happy you bought this product, I know I am.</li>
    <li> love it.  had an original epilady years ago.  This one seems so much better.  I like the light and it doesn;t hurt as much.  Would definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> I have had this device for almost a year now and, overall, I am satisfied with its quality. After the few initial epilations, I have almost forgotten what it&#x27;s like to worry about hairy legs. No more daily shaving and stub! With a touch-up here and there, I could go hairless for weeks. That was the best part of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is that I started getting ingrown hairs. Repeated epilations caused my skin to close and the new hairs would never come out. Instead, they stayed inside the skin, covering my legs in ugly dark bumps. It is really unpleasant to have your legs look like that during summer. I went back to shaving for some time, just to help the hair grow again, but I absolutely hated the feeling of stubs. I also started using body scrub on my legs more often. It alleviated the problem somewhat but didn&#x27;t make it go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s said, I have no complains about the epilator, but it didn&#x27;t work with my skin. If you&#x27;re planning to start using one, be prepared that you might face similar issues.</li>
    <li> I first tried this product from my cousin. I loved it! I haven&#x27;t used a razor since I bought this. Now be prepared....I&#x27;m not a softy, but it took about 3-4times using it under my arms before I didn&#x27;t tear up. But the end result: never shaving my underarms! And no shave bumps! Just be sure(for legs especially) to exfoliate often. Overall...I love this epilator and would purchase again in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product, just remember...removing hair in this manner, hurts. Removing a hair the size of a grain of salt is very optimistic and not my experience. I have tried the epilator in the shower and dry, with no difference in the pain. I like that this epilator can be washed, but I expect that is the only time it will ever be wet. If washing the unit is not important to you, you might want to save the money and go for a dry only model. Many of my hairs have broken so I have lots of little dark spots in some of my pores. I am not sure if the breakage is because I was going too quickly (to try and hurry through the pain) or at the wrong angle, but there appear to be less broken hairs with time. Whatever the pain, this is still better than shaving every day.</li>
    <li> This is really amazing product and the seller is awesome as well. This product is useful and I can use it even under the water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank u.</li>
    <li> Love the lamp it is very useful no need to look for &amp;#34;the perfect lamp.&amp;#34; Love the grip, it takes out even the most tiniest hairs, hardly hurts.  Excellent</li>
    <li> In 1988 I was given an epilator as a gift.  I have used it for all these years until the motor went.  I ordered this product to replace my first one, and I am very happy with it.  It is easier to use, and the light really helps.</li>
    <li> This is the best epilator I have ever purchased. The battery lasts almost 45 minutes, and love the orange details in the design.</li>
    <li> This is by far my all time fav amazon purchase! Its the best of both worlds, it appears as if u were shaving with a combination of waxing on the go but without the nasty sticky aftermath of wax! Yes it stings a little but its not a big deal to me. The down side is that u cannot use it while its charging :(&lt;br /&gt;Also ive noticed that sometimes it rips my hair rather than pull it with the follicle all out. And one more thing thats annoying and this one is my own personal issue is that my skin is so proned to ingrown hairs- well im learning how to deal with that by loofaing myself everyday. Anyways overall i still love my little tool despite the fact that its loud and looks like a personal vibrator (parents think wrong when i use it! Lmao) just wished i got it earlier in my life.</li>
    <li> Happy with the item. I did my legs, armsuder arms as well as some biking area. Still hesitant to do the entire bikini line...It was a little painful at first but totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I would give this 4.5 stars actually but the option does not exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not usually a big fan of epilators, first because they are noisy, second -let us face it- they are painful. Yet I owned one for quick touch ups in summer. The older model I have was one of the first created by Braun so it was on the slow side. When I got [[ASIN:B004TGUKG0 Braun SE 7181 WD Silk Epil 7 Epilator Xpressive Pro, Orange/Copper]]I noticed a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;It is way less noisy than the one I had before, it is also much faster. Don&#x27;t expect it to be as fast as a razor because it is not! Also it will be painful if the hair is too long or too thick. But as you use it more and more the hair will become thinner thus less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked about it is the smart light! It can be very handy in low light situations. But the best about this epilator, and what my old model lacked, is the pivoting head. It makes it easier to use on tricky parts like the knee and the back of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it is a nice product if you are traveling, unlike with razors, you have no security issues if you load it in your carry on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did not like though is that it won&#x27;t work while it is plugged. It is a charge only device. It is probably a safety thing since it can be used in the shower. I never tried that option, I don&#x27;t think I will, something in me cringes at using an electrical device with water. After all it is not really messy to use out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Best way to use it is to have music or TV on, it makes the noise less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another downside is that epilators can cause ingrown hairs if the skin is dry, usually they end up pointing out, but be sure to keep your skin hydrated and then no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a good product, my old epilator still works after 10 years of use, I just changed it because since my move, the voltage is not compatible. If this one works half as long, I would consider it a good deal still.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the missus and she assures me it is the best she has ever own. The last one was like 10 years old, so maybe the problem was overuse. I&#x27;m just hearing good news from this item. Price was O.K.</li>
    <li> This epilator is excellent! I&#x27;ve been using braun epilators for 15 years and this model is the best one I ever had. I like that it is rechargable, so you don&#x27;t need to plug in the electricity while using it: I have charged it once (when it first came) for about 2 hours and since then I&#x27;ve used it at least 4-5 times (just for the legs) and it is still going on, the battery lasts forever!!&lt;br /&gt;I like also the light, which makes it easier to see your hair, even if you are in a shaded room. And the tilting head is really improving the work, making it easier to hold without worrying that it is still in contact with the surface of the leg...To make it short, I have not found anything that could be improved!!!</li>
    <li> It works really well, looks pretty, the charge lasts a long time.  This is my first epilator.  I gave 4 stars because I have only had it a couple months and I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.  So far it&#x27;s very nice, and my legs have much less irritation than they did with shaving.</li>
    <li> Epilator works great.  Somewhat painful at first on legs, but after a few times, doesn&#x27;t even bother me. Underarms another story. Ouch!  I will continue to shave my underarms.  Also using on upper lip which is a bit painful but can handle it. New growth on legs is fine which is great.  Touching up legs every 3-4 days now, which sure beats shaving every other day!</li>
    <li> I purchased this gadget because I HATE shaving with a passion, because as soon as it&#x27;s done it&#x27;s time to do it again. With two little toddlers, you can&#x27;t depend on a daily shave. I tried the waxing route -- had an inexpensive (read: stupidly cheap) botched wax, and realized I needed something I could do at home without the mess. So I got one of these. I&#x27;ve shaved my whole life, had one leg wax, and set this thing to my skin. (Actually I think I took a previous reviewer&#x27;s advice and shaved a day or two before the first epilation, since it was already growing out by the time it arrived.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it! I&#x27;m still going through the first phases, I think, with hairs growing back at different times, but my every-other-day epilations are spacing out to every five days to a week (depending on where I have to be that day ;) and I love how it is already starting to grow back more slowly and more fine. It was painful the first time -- actually, it was more painful the 2nd or 3rd, around my period -- but I&#x27;ve never used advil or the numbing cloths that come with it, and I&#x27;ve never fainted away from pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that, contrary to a lot of the reviews I read, it does leave behind quite a few hairs for me to tweeze. However, for now I&#x27;m chalking that up to user error, since I&#x27;m still figuring out the techniques. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone wanting to break out of the shaving cycle!</li>
    <li> I have thin, blonde hairs and it did not pull the hairs out. I have a high threshold for pain and went over my legs several times, trying different heads, different angles, trying fast or slow, and still would not pull my hairs out. I gave it an honest shot -- spent hours over several days working with this product after reading the other customer reviews. It did pull a few hairs but not enough to get smooth legs. I would say it probably pulled about 20% of my hairs out after spending several hours.</li>
    <li> Sorry to report that I am a wuss; I found the Epilator was a bit \\&quot;ouchy\\&quot;, I have very sensitive skin that gets red and bumpy if you upset it, and anyway, I don&#x27;t have a lot of leg hair to deal with. If you do need to shave regularly, this would be great as it does make a smooth swath and no razor cuts. Maybe I just have used those blue razors so long, it is hard for me to change. You may have much better results, many people swear by this personal appliance.</li>
    <li> I bought this to supplement my Emjoi divine. I purchased that one due to it being inexpensive. It worked pretty well, but I wanted something better to get more hair on my legs.  This seems to do a better job, I think the light really helps! I will use the other one for travel or if this one isn&#x27;t charged. This will be my primary one! Also love the glittering look on the handle. Very pretty.</li>
    <li> I found that the product stood up to the stipulations that was advertised.  It was a pleasure using the Braun Epilady, no hurt and quick hair removal</li>
    <li> It was not painful after the initial use.  However, it will take about 30 minutes to do each leg properly.  I decided that shaving 3x a week is faster after all.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I&#x27;m using epilators for years and this one is the best.  Painless and more comfort, and the light on the top is very helpful.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for getting even the slight hair growth and it left my legs smooth and feeling great.  Easy to use and handle and didn&#x27;t feel discomfort when removing the hair.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write product reviews but for this one I felt I had to. There are soooo many epilators available out there and I read the reviews on many of them before making my decision to purchase this one. Everyone has their favorite and I think with an epilator, you get out of it what you put in. I received my Braun SE 7181 yesterday and briefly tried it out on the back of my hand to see how it felt. It wasn&#x27;t too bad so I felt like I could proceed to my legs when I was ready. I have read a lot of reviews with complaints of ingrown hair after epilating and I have had this happen to me after waxing many years ago, so I went out to Rite Aid and got myself a loofah pad for $2.49 and will make sure I use it regularly to exfoliate my skin so that this does not happen to me again. When I arrived home from work tonight I epilated my lower legs for the first time. I&#x27;m not going to lie, it definitely hurts, but it was completely tolerable. I last shaved my legs this past Sunday, and had short stubbly growth. I have very dark, thick and course hair. I believe that the shorter the hair, the better. I can&#x27;t imagine doing this with a forest growing on my legs, it would definitely hurt way too much. I also noticed that if  you pull your skin very taut, it helps with the pain as well. I had to make several passes over each area I did, but the light really helps in seeing what you missed, and the more hair you clear out, the less it hurts in that area. For me the trick seems to be pulling my skin very tight and moving the epilator in short but slower strokes. Now I know that no one wants to prolong the torture but I found that if I picked it up off my skin too quickly, it was breaking the hairs rather than pulling them out. I got through both lower legs in about 1/2 hour and the epilator seems to have plenty of battery life left.  My legs are a lot more smooth than when I started, but there is still some stubble left which I expected since hair grows at different rates. I am going to keep up the epilating every other day or so and I feel that with time, I will need to do it less and less. I have been shaving my legs for probably 25 years, and I definitely do not expect a miracle after one use. After the epilation my legs are red and splotchy which I expected as well. I am sure that they will be back to normal in the morning. I wiped them down with a cool washcloth and moisturized them with pure coconut oil. I do NOT recommend using any type of lotion or cream afterward as I feel it would burn. Organic virgin coconut oil is totally natural, very soothing, has antibacterial properties, and is a great moisturizer. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase so far and will try to post updates as I go along.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase. It works great and is so much easier than shaving. My legs have never been this smooth, nor has it lasted so long. I used to have to shave every other day, and since using this product It&#x27;s a once every couple of weeks thing. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> I like it. It works great for me. just recommended to who used to it. It is sharp and powerful</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an Epilady and another Braun over the last 15 years and this is the best.  It works faster, and the cordless feature makes it so much easier to use.  I&#x27;m very happy with it, and recommend it highly,</li>
    <li> This epilator is great, very easy to use and it does what it says. I would definitely purchase it again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product. Works as described. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work while charging _ and not spectacular at grabbing hairs - as epilators go. Wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the 70 dollars. I have a 15 dollar emoji mini that&#x27;s still working after 3 years.</li>
    <li> I was definitely nervous to try this product, but the combination of not wanting to shave every other day and not being able to afford waxing every other week made me give it a shot. Also had a friend who swears by it. I had similar experiences to the other reviews in terms of pain - I took some ibuprofen and used the wipes beforehand, and it was not nearly as painful as I thought it would be. Instead of the prolonged pain that comes with each hair when self-plucking your eyebrows, these were sharp little pinpricks with very little oomph. Totally manageable. The skin was was a little inflamed the next day, but that cleared up after a few days, and I expect it to get better with time. My legs stayed reasonably hair free (or shorts-ready) for at least 5 days, a huge improvement over shaving. I imagine that I will get into a habit of epilating once every 1-1.5 weeks and shaving once or twice in between. The one disappointment was the smoothness - I am used to having extremely smooth and strokable legs after shaving (even if it only lasts for 1/2 a day), and this did not happen with the epilator. I may not be doing it right, but now I&#x27;m wondering if I would get this effect with waxing anyways. Hopefully once my legs get used to it, I will be able to follow up with a shave right after epilating, and it will help with the smoothness and ingrown hairs. I&#x27;m excited for the summer months now though, so the purchase was totally worthwhile for me.</li>
    <li> love my brown epilator, this is the third one I owe. Not giving it 5 stars because my previous one lost power, eventhough it was not battery operated, so I had to purchase a new one and I am not happy about it.</li>
    <li> This product is much better than the dry-use epilators only.  It&#x27;s nice to use it in the shower and the light helps reveal what&#x27;s going on as you epilate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this for people who are epilators.</li>
    <li> I was little apprehensive about buying it as i had an idea that epilators are painful. As expected it was a little painful for the very first time i used it but after using a couple of times i felt its much much better than  waxing or shaving. Regrowth is slower and skin remains smooth . Add on is that its a money saver. Just one time investment and no further expenses on shaving. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This epilator is amazing.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now and it still holds a charge just as good as the first day I got it.</li>
    <li> its way painful than i imagine but what the hell it removes hair from the root so it should of been expected but i love my product and i am so excited it removes alllllllll my hair and did i mention i love it lol its amazing  blessing to the company and seller it came already charged up  and beautifully packaged so i am happy about that</li>
    <li> So of course Epilators hurt; but you get over that quickly.  What is the worst part?  How LONG it takes.  I don&#x27;t have 2 hours every other week to spare to Epliating.  Maye I could have bought one with more \\&quot;pinchers\\&quot; I am not sure what they are called, but this one takes forever.  Waxing would be better in my opinion.  Personally, I am just going to suffer the couple min it takes to shave.  Bummer, I was really looking forward to being an epilator person.</li>
    <li> Works great! Moving guide head takes a little getting used to. Love that I can use it in or out of the shower!</li>
    <li> It was a bit hard to get used to at first but now I LOVE using this. I never shave my legs any more. Now, I have used it on my armpits and it hurts a bit more. Legs only for me. But, so worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite a veteran at using epilators. I got the first Braun Silk Epil about 15 years ago and I remember it took me a few hours to get my legs done...I thought it was so painful. Now this new one is a breeze. First of all, it pulls more hair so you don&#x27;t have to go over and over again on the same area. I was probably done with everything in 20-30min. Second of all, if you think this is painful, I have no idea what epilators used to be like. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the massaging beads or if I&#x27;ve just gotten used to the pain over time, or maybe both, but to me it just feels like little pinches. The skin doesn&#x27;t get as irritated as it used to. The last epilator I had was the green/blue one in the 5 series and my skin would be red for a few hours after I&#x27;d use it. I also use Tend Skin after epilation which is a lotion for bumps and ingrown hairs that disinfects and soothes the skin so the irritation is gone after about 20min.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a more convenient and cheaper alternative to waxing and a longer lasting and smoother one than shaving.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I have never used an epilator before, though I have tried to wax my own legs &amp; underarms unsuccessfully a time or two. I hate shaving, not because I tend to cut myself or get razor burn, but because I tend to shave fast and leave paths of hair left over! With the Braun SE 7181 WD Silk Epil 7, I tend to take my time, enjoying the fact that it is taking it out root and all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Shave and then use a few days after!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I did not take the above advice from other reviewers, I put myself through more pain than I needed to. I also didn&#x27;t use the wipes, since there are only so many and I thought I should get used to it without them. Yes, it feels like little pricks all over, and some areas are definitely more sensitive than others (I haven&#x27;t even talked myself into doing the bikini line yet...yowza!). I am SOOO glad that I bought this! My legs are just as smooth as when I shave and it really doesn&#x27;t hurt as much when the hair is short. At the moment, I am using it every few days until I get all of the different growth cycles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside: There are additional attachments that I wish came with it. I&#x27;m going to look into getting them separately though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I gave this review a 4 star just because this is my first epilator, so I have nothing else to compare it to.</li>
    <li> Works great! I have thick hair, still it does its job great!&lt;br /&gt;Smooth skin!&lt;br /&gt;BUT- its battery life is pathetic! It takes 1 night to charge and I can finish only 2 hands or 2 legs in 1 go :/&lt;br /&gt;So you have to plan 2 days to complete! :(&lt;br /&gt;There was one time that I finished with one hand and battery died! It was very frustrating :(&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking of buying the one that works with cord</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first about the effectiveness of the product.  I have never used an epilator out of fear of it hurting too much.  I have really course dark hair on fair/light skin and I was just fed up with razors, waxing, and plucking.  I have used this product about a dozen times already and I&#x27;m in love!  My bikini line looks great and my legs are already feeling smooth.  And, no more red bumps or ingrown hairs!  I won&#x27;t lie, though, when you first use the product, it will smart a bit.  Keep at it though because your skin will get used to epilating and you will be pain free very soon.  It took only 2 to 3 times on my legs before the pain went away.  The product&#x27;s price is a small price to pay considering all the money I had spent on waxing and on razors and with more pain!</li>
    <li> I had an old epilator before I bought this device and this one worked great* for 3 months, albeit very light usage. Then, it started going crazy and turning on and off while the dial was in the off (0) position - blinking lights and sudden motor turning on. In the middle of the night, it&#x27;s quite alarming; it&#x27;s also a great safety concern. Don&#x27;t know if mine is just defective but I&#x27;d advise staying away; 3 months is too short to start having issues. Unit still looks brand new and functions perfectly when not in it&#x27;s crazy state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*After the initial OUCH and finer hairs growing in, this unit really eases the ouch factor compared to my old epilator due to the ability to use is in warm water.</li>
    <li> This Epilator is one of the best that I have ever had and I would recommend buying it, However it is a little bet noisy.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying, I am pretty tough. I&#x27;ve calmly and quietly passed large kidney stones on many occasions, had tonsils out as an adult, labored and given birth (almost) naturally twice, ruptured my eardrum and continued working...the list goes on. But epilating HURTS. This was my first experience with using an epilator. I read thousands of reviews before deciding on this one. I was a DAILY shaver, with light to medium colored and coarsely textured body hair.&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s a piece of crap. Instead of &amp;#34;smooth, hairless skin for weeks&amp;#34;, I had stubbly, bleeding broken off hairs all over my legs after spending 2 HOURS following the directions by soaking, exfoliating, and using the wipes provided. With that much time and pain (there was cursing, muttering, and yelping at times) I should have been smoother than a baby&#x27;s cheeks.  I attempted one pass at my underarm and said nooooo way. Same goes for bikini line. This little p.o.c. is going back.&lt;br /&gt;pros: (there are a few)&lt;br /&gt; can operate while plugged in.&lt;br /&gt; the light on it is kinda cool.&lt;br /&gt; you can use it while wet.&lt;br /&gt; it was light and easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;cons:(there are a lot!)&lt;br /&gt; it didn&#x27;t do an even mildly good job at pulling hair out by the root. Broke most of them off.&lt;br /&gt; HURTS A LOT&lt;br /&gt; caused a lot of ingrown hairs- which are really tough to get rid off.&lt;br /&gt; pricey for something that doesn&#x27;t work!&lt;br /&gt; the hair it broke off grew back in like 2 days.&lt;br /&gt; even after many passes over the same area, neither broke off nor removed most of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: don&#x27;t bother. I bought an Emjoi Seal after giving this thing several chances with no improvement in its performance. While I am still not smooth and hairless, the Emjoi gave a noticeably less painful, more effective experience. I still shave every few days now.</li>
    <li> No problems yet. I found it is not very painful, as compared to waxing. Haven&#x27;t tried wet, so cannot comment on that.</li>
    <li> I have been using epilators for about three years now, so I am already quite familiar with these types of devices and am realistic when it comes to results; however, this epilator is awful for many reasons.  It does not grab thick hair very well. I have to go over the same spot several times to even get a few hairs, so when I finally do get them, the skin is left broken and hurts to touch.  Most of the hairs are just being cut not pulled from the root. I use an epilator mainly for my underarms and am very disappointed with these results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item for my sister and myself at the same time. She is also having similar results and doesn&#x27;t like this epilator either, so it&#x27;s not just me.</li>
    <li> Great product with a wonderful price.  Does everything you need and much more. Works well on the skin, Now I couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Silk Epil for years but I recently decided to upgrade my model b/c mine was really old and although it still worked, it took forever to do my hairy legs.  I am SO happy that I upgraded b/c this has at least twice as many tweezers and makes doing my legs so much faster!  The light is pretty helpful to let me find each and every hair on my leg. The charge lasts long enough for me to do both legs so the battery life is sufficient for my needs.  I charge it after every session so I have no idea how long a full charge would last.  I&#x27;ve only used it dry.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months now and am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great epilator. I am very happy)One of the best staff, I have ever had. But I use it only for legs.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Very happy with my purchase. Its easy and very convenient to use and it doesn&#x27;t hurt a bit.I used to have an old Braun epilator (15 years old) but it was no longer properly working. I really felt the change with this new braun. I think I will have it for the next 15 years because its a great brand.</li>
    <li> I purchased Braun SE 7181 WD Silk Epil 7 Epilator, Orange/Copper to use on my face, I had a different brand for years and it worked well for me until my toddler put it in the washing machine while I was loading it. I was attracted to this brand because you can use it dry or wet, my other brand you could use it dry only. Even though it was more expensive than the one I had, I thought it would be worth it, but low and behold the first time &#x60;I used it, I realized it was breaking most of the hairs and not pulling them out, which in turn caused me to have abscesses on my face and neck and had to go to the emergency room to get some help. for me it did not perform as described.</li>
    <li> I was really tired of having to shave almost everyday, and even then not looking as clean as I would like. At this point I was even ready to give waxing a try again (Recap: Back in HS I decided to never try waxing again because of the pain, yes I am chicken in pain tolerance). I wanted to use something that would remove the hair from the root, but too scared to buy an epilator. Then my cousin came to visit me, and she&#x27;s been using Braun Silk -epil for at least 10 years, and loves it (I think she has Silk-epil 3 or 4). I decided to give it a try, I was really scared, it took her literally 10 minutes of running the machine before I even let her touch my skin. Once it touched it and started I was hooked! Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you&#x27;re still removing hair from the root so you will feel something, but I would not describe it as \\&quot;painful\\&quot;. My hair length on my legs were not that long (probably had shaved few days earlier) may be that&#x27;s why? But anyways, this convinced me to buy it. I researched and bought this one, and LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1. I know it says once you remove your hair it does not come back for weeks. It might be true, because hair  does go through different growth process. I have had it for a little over a month now, and I have had to do touch ups every week. I am hoping eventually I will get to the no hair for 6 weeks zone. I feel like I haven&#x27;t had it for long enough to make this point a cons. Even I have to do a touch up today,  I went swimming without hesitance (and I am pretty sensitive about some stub here and there showing).&lt;br /&gt; 2. Various Areas and Pain&lt;br /&gt; ⁃ Dry Legs: Pain 1 (on the scale of 1- 10 with 10 being highest)&lt;br /&gt; ⁃ Legs with pre-wipe: Pain 2 (for some reason I found it more painful when I used the wipes&lt;br /&gt; ⁃ Dry/Wet Armpit: Haven&#x27;t had the guts to try yet, but I have had laser treatment done for my underarms so I am not too worried. Shaving works just fine.&lt;br /&gt; ⁃ Dry Arms: Pain 3 (arms are usually slightlymore painful for me)&lt;br /&gt; ⁃ Wet Arms: haven&#x27;t tried it&lt;br /&gt; ⁃ Bikini: Have not had the courage to try it yet. I just use my Braun electric shaver for now.&lt;br /&gt; 3. I really like the light features, makes it easier for me to spot dark hairs.&lt;br /&gt; 4. The charge is really good, it stays on for a while. I have used it for a month without having to charge it (I am just charging it for the first time today).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt; 1. If you care of wanting the razor attachment, this one does not come with one. It was not a problem for me because I have Braun electric razor that looks similar to this one in blue (another great product, have had it for &gt;6 years and no complaints so far).&lt;br /&gt; 2. The equipment is not as easy to hold as it could. For example, there are two settings you can use it one #1 or #2, but you need to first turn it on with the help of your other hand and then use it. You cannot turn it on and off easily.&lt;br /&gt; 3. I feel like some of the hair is simply being cut off and not properly removed from the root, but most like I am not doing it properly, either I am not touching the area in correct direction or something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because you are removing hair from the roots, there is always some concern about in-grown hair. I have not had a problem with it, I usually use a bath towel to exfoliate every time I shower. However, I must admit I have seen some hair trying to break through from the skin, and I gently rub the dead skin off.</li>
    <li> I have used several different brands of epilators over the years and this one is by far the best. The light is one of the best improvements- it really highlights all the hairs in the area and prevents you from missing spots. In additin, this epilator removes all the hairs- even fine ones which other epilators have a tendency to leave behind. I would highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple years now and still continue to use it. I&#x27;d give this about a 3.5 stars. The first couple of times I used it, I would get these sort-of razor bumps on my legs and underarms. I still get some of them now, but not as much. Though it gets the job done, you have to go over and over it and it takes a pretty long time. I&#x27;m naturally quite hairless but it still takes me about an hour or two to go over nearly every single spot in my body (don&#x27;t even think about using it in your bikini area, just go to a special waxing salon for that). The battery life is great and I like how the device fits in my hand, a little on the heavier side, but I&#x27;m not complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Any tips I would give are to use it when your skin is dry, when it&#x27;s wet, it&#x27;s harder for the tweezers to pluck out the hairs, I also find that it prickles more when you use it wet. Most importantly, for me and a couple of my other friends who&#x27;ve tried it, I find it best to take the cap off when I go over my underarms. I don&#x27;t have any excess skin in my underarms, but my skin always manages to get caught between the tweezers and the cap and have bled a couple times from it. It healed after a week or so, but I think it&#x27;s something that anyone planning to buy this, should keep in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Overall, I&#x27;m not entirely satisfied with this purchase, but at the time when this item was still relatively new, I was. It&#x27;s only been a few years since then, but now there are many more options to choose from. If I had the option, I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again and would probably take a stab at one of those at home waxing kits or DIY sugaring. But hey, it still beats shaving.</li>
    <li> Everyone is saying \\&quot;not for the faint of heart\\&quot; on this product. And to an extent this is true. I have a very low pain threshold. I go running for the Advil at least four times a week. I&#x27;m pathetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But shaving my underarms was getting unbearable. I would get ingrown hairs weekly. Razor burn with the most excruciating frequency. And my legs? Well I&#x27;m 5&#x27;8, and all leg. The hair on my thighs is very fine, not prickly like the hair on my lower legs, and I could never get it all. I&#x27;d go over and over and over with a razor, rinse the razor out, over and over, and still find fuzzy patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got sick of it. I got this product. I said \\&quot;it&#x27;s $70, if I spend that much money, I&#x27;ll HAVE to use it.\\&quot; It arrived promptly in good condition. I charged it up and stepped in the shower with it. Then the fun began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my legs it felt like plucking my eyebrows. Not every tug hurt, but you occasionally find that one hair that won&#x27;t let go and it stings. But after a while I got used to it. My legs were splotchy and red for a few hours after, so definitely do it in the evening so it can dissipate overnight. Then I tried my underarms, thinking my legs didn&#x27;t hurt so bad, this should be fine. I squeaked. It hurts. But I was determined, so I went slowly. VERY slowly. Eventually I got my way through. BE PATIENT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I didn&#x27;t have to shave under my arms. It was amazing. The day after that, there was some hair grown back but it was already less. That day I tried again under my arms and it hurt less. And it&#x27;s continued to hurt less. I&#x27;m still having trouble getting all the hair on my legs, thus the 4 stars. You have to be willing to keep at it. If you&#x27;re the type to try something once and if you don&#x27;t like it never do it again, don&#x27;t waste your money. If you can tough out a few days, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it makes a terrifyingly loud noise. Be prepared to turn it on the first time and think it&#x27;s going to take your skin with it. My fiance got wide-eyed when I showed him. Pretty funny! :D</li>
    <li> Just love this, second one I have now, works great. Love the light. Fast delivery, no problems at all. Old one lastet several years until the battery was not charging.</li>
    <li> WARNiNG!!! Do not purchase this product... left me with so many ingrown hairs on my bikini area, thighs, and legs. Also it hurts like crazy. Get the Silk n&#x27; Flash n Go laser hair removal it&#x27;s painless and works much better for permanent hair removal.</li>
    <li> Less expensive than wax and you get the same results. I will tell my friends and family about this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an Epilady, then a Emjoy epilator in the past.  Inevitably they give out and die after a few years and need replaced. When I bought this I thought it might be over priced .. I saw a similar product for around $20 and was tempted but, what the heck, you get what you pay for I thought (sometimes).  In this case that&#x27;s totally true! The technology or design or whatever has advanced SO much in the last 20 years I&#x27;ve been using these things. It&#x27;s bordering on miraculous. Since my Emjoy had died I hadn&#x27;t epilated in a few weeks.  This left my legs SMOOOOTHHH instantly.  The other models I&#x27;ve used needed to have me use tweezers to finish off the loose straggler hairs, but not here. Two weeks later I&#x27;m still smooth!! I&#x27;m an extremely picky purchaser and can&#x27;t say enough good things about this. I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower yet ...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with this product but it&#x27;s a complete disaster. I&#x27;m not a newbie, I&#x27;ve been using my good old Philips epilator for years without any issues. But this product can work only in two ways: a) doing nothing at all; b) scratching my skin till it bleeds. Its only plus is wirelessness, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one.</li>
    <li> As soon as I recieved this I ripped it out of the box and tried it out- literally.  I cut the box open, pulled it out, turned it on (it had a decent charge from the factory)and had at it.  I did not use the pre-epil wipes, I have been using an epilator for 8 years or so and I expect pain, no baby wipes will stop that.  My first reaction was, &amp;#34;Is it doing anything?&amp;#34; then &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34;  I have used the Emjoi Gently Gold Caress for years now so I was used to gritting my teeth in pain, sweating, and cursing when ever I epilated.  But with the Braun Silk Epil there was none of that.  I have ever only epilated my legs and the Braun did not cause me any pain at all, not a single twinge so I tried it on the back of my hand where there are fine baby hairs, and eh- I got a little twinge but nothing horrible.  The light really does help pinpoint those missed hairs.  I have not braved the underarm area, never have desired to have my husband find me passed out with an epilator in hand from the pain that would have cause from using my Emjoi, but maybe with the Braun I might try.  Overall this product is great.  Much less painful than other epilators I have tried and I really just aboslutely love the light.  4 years Later Update*** I still use this. It still charges, holds a charge, and works great. My only problem is that I sometimes let my mind wander whle using it and I press too hard and it grabs up my skin and leaves a nasty bruise- but I blame myself for that.</li>
    <li> Excellent, but buy extra warranty. Mine died right after my one year warranty just ended. I bought a second one (from Target and purchased  a two year warranty) and it is in the process of dying at 1.5 years.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;d read many reviews before purchasing the Braun SE 7181 WD Silk Epil 7 Epilator and knew what to expect as far as the pain goes, I thought it was going to be a dream come true for smooth legs for weeks on end. I like the epilator. It works well and does what it is supposed to. However, it is a process and you must be persistent to receive the desired results. I do recommend high pain tolerance though. It is true that the pain lessens after the first use. All in all, I&#x27;m pleased with my epilator and will continue using it. Thanks Braun!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best things i have bought in a LONG time! It is worth every penny!!! It hurts the first time but after that you just keep up with it and it doesnt really hurt at all! Definetly a must buy!!</li>
    <li> BACKGROUND&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy the Silk Epil after seeing an old college friend at brunch.  Her arms were totally hairless (after being pretty hairy a couple of years ago).  I asked her about it and she told me about the Silk Epil.  She said she had been using it for about a year and a half on her arms and legs and she has replaced it a couple of times since then (as it wears out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some background on me, I&#x27;m part middle eastern, so that means a lot of thick hair!  I have been doing underarm and bikini waxes for awhile, so I wasn&#x27;t afraid of the pain and I&#x27;m used to the normal ingrown hairs that you get when you pull hair out by the root!  I&#x27;ve been pondering getting my arms and legs waxed but its just too expensive!  So with that said, I decided to give the Silk Epil a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST IMPRESSIONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I pulled it out of the box, it was pretty (very glittery, which you cant see in the online photos). You definitely have to read the manual because its not apparent from just plugging it in how to use it.  Also, there are some parts that I can&#x27;t figure out for the life of me how to use....yet.  After a couple minutes of confusion I figured out that I need to charge it before I can use it and after it charged it was pretty straightforward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPRESSIONS ON USE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got the Silk Epil, I was expecting pain...but its way more pain than I expected!  Waxes are fast and actually pretty painless.  This was definitely and surprisingly worse!  However as others have mentioned, there are ways to make it tolerable.  I used it while watching tv and just did short strokes and stopped for maybe 30 or 40 seconds and started back up again.  It took me maybe an hour to do a leg and both arms but it was bearable.  Also, as you can imagine, the sparser the hair the more tolerable the pain.  So I anticipate that each subsequent hair removal will hurt less because you will only be catching one growth cycle at a time. (yes, as others have mentioned hair grows on different cycles, if you do it dilligently there will only be a percentage of the hair growing back at any one time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE AFTERMATH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it was a little red and irritated but i cleaned it and put some ingrown hair lotion and when I woke up the area looked great! (and incredibly soft).  As with waxes, I expect some hairs to start growing back in a couple of days (at which point I will use the Silk Epil to pull them back out!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silk Epil was realtively easy to use and quite effective at pulling out hair.  Despite the surprising amount of pain, I will definitely be keeping up the epilation for my arms and legs as it&#x27;s WAY cheaper than going to get them waxed and I can tolerate the pain.  However, for sensitive regions, like underarms and bikini, I will continue getting professional waxes.</li>
    <li> I used another type of Brown epilator before, and it was ok, but I really like the fact that I can use this one in the shower, in fact I always use it in the shower, it makes epilation easier, less painfull, and it saves me time.The light is a good feature, I used to skip a lot of hairs before, now I have this covered.As for the ingrown hair, this is not this epilator&#x27;s fault, this is what you get with any epilator, so there are products on the market that help you with that....One thing I know for sure, shaving is not for me!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have always had silk epil by braun. I bought my first epilator 14 years ago, yes you read right! 14 years ago and it was perfect until now I replace it for Braun SE 7181. What can I say? It is much more efficient, less painful and the white light it is very useful. I definitely recommend this product if you want to be soft for longer! And if you use it regularly, you will have less hair! It is a fact! So go and get it, no doubts!</li>
    <li> I used to wax at home and it was very time consuming and messy. This is quick and convenient. When I first turned this on, the machine started rolling and it was loud which looked quite scary but I tried it and it wasn&#x27;t as painful as I thought it would be. So if you&#x27;re someone who waxes, this isn&#x27;t going to all that painful. The good thing is that you can use this in the shower and it reduces the pain in sensitive areas, but I don&#x27;t like the results from using it in the water as much as the results I get from using it when it is dry.&lt;br /&gt;The bad thing about this is that its annoying trying to clean this out after using it. The tiny hair get stuck in this and its a pain trying to get them all out. The brush is helpful and running it under water gets most of them out but there are still some here and there and I find it annoying spending the time trying to clean this.&lt;br /&gt;Also, you would need to take care of your skin to make sure you don&#x27;t get ingrown hair. Other than that, this is a great substitute for waxing.</li>
    <li> I have been using epilators for last 10 years and am VERY happy with them. All these years, i have been using different models of Remington and never thought of moving to anything else. When the last one ran out its life this time, I thought of checking user reviews for epilators to find what others are liking and ordered Braun after reading its good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I have received it just 3 hrs back.... yep.....and have used it on my legs and underarm...... and results are awesome!&lt;br /&gt;It really &amp;#34;does&amp;#34; pick the shortest hair and works great on wet skin too. I am happy I moved to Braun.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product.  I take it where ever I go on vacation.  It works really well for me.  Sometimes a bit time consuming, but still cheaper and effective!</li>
    <li> I got this epilator thinking that wet and dry feature would make it less painful while epilating in the shower. It did not make a lot of difference as compared to my regular old epilator and it was more difficult to clean the small hair sticking in the epilator due to water</li>
    <li> This tool does what it says. It rips hair from the follicle at a high velocity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it hurts, mostly the first time. However, subsequent use hurts less because it&#x27;s a new hair with a thinner root and lighter in color. It&#x27;s not a thick root that&#x27;s been cut for years and years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, it doesn&#x27;t leave you as smooth as shaving does initially. But it lasts longer and the hair is softer. Again, because it&#x27;s new hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you understand hair growth you&#x27;ll realize that this tool will take a little time to get the best results, just like waxing. Hair grows in 3 phases, so it will take several months for all the hair to be new, softer, lighter colored growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using mine every few days for 2 weeks and already notice a difference in the look and feel of &amp;#34;stubble.&amp;#34; I hated the stubble of shaving more than the inconvenience of having to do it all the time. Within 24 hours my legs felt like sandpaper, my armpits looked smudged, and my bikini area would itch. No longer!! That&#x27;s what I love the most! You can&#x27;t really even see any hair under my arms, and my bikini area doesn&#x27;t itch anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried home recipes for sugaring before resorting to this. The first time the pain is very similar in intensity, but this was easier for me to do. And not as messy! With subsequent uses the pain is much, much less. And yes, there&#x27;s irritation. The first time, again, is the worst, but leave yourself a few hours of recovery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great alternative hair removal method.</li>
    <li> good article but doesn t always remove roots of hair... it&#x27;s use is quite painful but I still like that better than going to get legs waxed!&lt;br /&gt;No mOre shaving!</li>
    <li> No matter how you look at it, even with time, it hurts. It is also loud. Yes it does work, but if you have sensitive skin it will be painful,&lt;br /&gt;Which I guess I have sensitive skin. I used it on my chin and upper lip area, sensitive areas. When you clean  it you will certainly see&lt;br /&gt; the hair that was plucked out.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the way it may my face look after using it. I finally broke down and bought the no!no!, that is working out real nicely. My face doesn&#x27;t look weird after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps out.</li>
    <li> This was the first epilator I have tried. While I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better or worse than others in its class, I can say it was easy to learn according to instructions. It did what it claimed insofar as removing hairs and being straightforward to use and clean. Battery power was more than adequate for my slow and inexperienced attempts and it seemed to recharge quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as someone with moderately thick and dark, fast growing hair, I found this to be too tedious and uncomfortable to switch from a simple razor. Bummer because plucking hairs out is the only way for me to get a truly smooth look, as the roots are often slightly visible through fair skin. Ultimately the smoothness didn&#x27;t last long enough to be worth the inconvenience.</li>
    <li> It worked OK for the first few months - not as well as some epilady epilators I&#x27;ve had in the past, but well enough, except it suddenly stopped working a few months into having it.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly high tolerance for pain, having had countless surgeries and injuries and walking away as the favorite patient on that floor, because I will endure just about anything without even a frown on my face. But, this epilator hurt SO BAD. It was not effective in grabbing short or fine hairs, and left red bumps that cut when shaved over.</li>
    <li> Long battery life between recharges. Effective hair removal. Waterproof. Is there more that you&#x27;re supposed to want from an epilator? Streaming video? Text-messaging?</li>
    <li> I bought this by checking reviews on Amazon which were helpful.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a good product. I will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Reviewing this machine is like reviewing a necessary evil; if the phrase &amp;#34;pain is beauty&amp;#34; were manifested in a device this would be it. But with that said, epilation is BY FAR the most effective and inexpensive method of hair removal I&#x27;ve experienced so far, and I would highly recommend it to anyone that&#x27;s struggled with achieving a smooth, hairless look with shaving alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it hurts, *especially* the first time. Get the affected areas waxed, or at least shave them, and then wait to epilate little by little until you&#x27;re used to the sensation. What they should have included instead of wipes is a few shots of tequila and a stick to bite on. What&#x27;s the most annoying part about it is not the pain itsef, but the fact that you have to do it repeatedly in order to cover a large area. Just imagine what waxing would feel like if you had to do it for 5 second spurts instead of 0.5 seconds, and you have a pretty good idea of what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When epilating, I like to put headphones on so I don&#x27;t have to hear the whirring roar of the machine or the sound of hundreds of hairs getting ripped out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first time doing my armpits took me over an hour, but I&#x27;m down to under 5 minutes now, around 10 for my legs. Just 15 minutes and I don&#x27;t even have to worry about how my underarms look for two weeks. Before, I could shave my armpits and the very next day be seeing stubble because of my dark brown hair and fair skin...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the hair on my thighs is finer I don&#x27;t even bother with the epilator much past the knee, and even after nearly a a year of use I&#x27;m still too scared to use it anywhere &amp;#34;sensitive.&amp;#34; But even for my calves and armpits and occasionally my arms this thing is seriously a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A frightening, painful miracle.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to every woman who wants an&lt;br /&gt;easier hair removal system. Love the idea of removing hair myself&lt;br /&gt;in the privacy of my own home. Love the money I save, since I stopped&lt;br /&gt;paying for expensive waxing.</li>
    <li> I own the silk epil 5, which does work fine, but this one is so much better! My mother owns one and I used it the other night when I was staying over there, and I can&#x27;t believe how much better this one is.&lt;br /&gt;The cordlessness is definitely a plus, though it would be nice if it had the option to be used while plugged in (when you are charging it does not turn on). But its nice to have the freedom to epilate anywhere without worrying about cords, or sitting on the ground next to an outlet.&lt;br /&gt;I think the thing that really makes this an improvement over the last model is the pivoting head, it kinda ensures that you are holding it at the best angle to get the hairs, and makes the whole process a bit smoother. I don&#x27;t know it just makes things easier.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely noticed the improvement when using it on my armpits, the old model pulled on hairs multiple times before getting them out, this one does it the first time, and the hair follicles are less red-looking afterwards (it still hurts like a bitch though, totally worth it for smooth armpits for days)&lt;br /&gt;But yeah, definitely putting this on my wish list</li>
    <li> This is not my first epillator.  It worked well in the beginning but after 6 months the battery only holds charge for 10-15 minutes. Not enough to accomplish much.</li>
    <li> Awesome emulator! Bought to replace my Epilady. This Braun is so much better! More power, pulls more hairs and the light is a big help. This one even works on the under arms!  Don&#x27;t get me wrong it still stings, but not as bad and pulls the finer hairs too. I love it! It is well worth the price</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews I decided to go ahead with my purchase.  After using the item the first couple of times your pain level lessens quite a bit.  Scrub the skin and steam the area where the hair is to be removed.  I have done both dry and wet hair removing.  The dry works better.  Just go in short strokes, not long ones and take it easy.&lt;br /&gt;It works,  so I will update my experience in the next few weeks as to how the hair thins out and lessens.</li>
    <li> Fast and easy. this one is a little bit more painful compared to my old product but less time consuming.</li>
    <li> I used it lightly on an area that already waxed, so i just use it for the little tiny hair that the wax could not pull. It just started to pull on my hair but not take it out. One of the tweezers came loose. it hurt bad. I rarely used it. disappoint it. I gave it 2 start just because of the speed.</li>
    <li> How did I not know this existed until now??? Would recommend to all that wax regularly- you&#x27;ll save a ton of money (with less visits or none to your waxer).</li>
    <li> I think of Epilator for the face and this is definitly an electric razor that may work for a mans face or a lady to do her legs.  Caro</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for my girlfriend, she loves it.. Perfect gift for my girlfriend, she loves it..  Perfect gift for my girlfriend, she loves it.. Perfect gift for my girlfriend, she loves it..</li>
    <li> The other reviews of this product are spot on. I had a different Skil-Epil, but it was not a wet and dry, and that is what makes the difference. It works just as well, but hurts much less under the shower. Overall great products, it&#x27;s a bit noisy but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
    <li> I had the same product for a little over a year--my first epilator and i guess the battery can only be recharged so many times.  However, i ended up with the same one.  I love that it&#x27;s cordless--i can do this wherever i want (while i watch TV, etc) and i especially love the light that helps you see the hairs you missed.  I don&#x27;t know if the product has improved over the past year or if my old one just had \\&quot;aged\\&quot; tweezers, but this new one is getting so many more hairs than the last one!!  And i used to only use the plain cap, but now use the one with the little rollers, which help distract your sensors/nerve from the hair pulling.  Overall, this second one is performing outstanding!</li>
    <li> un muy buen producto excelente y el envio fue muy eficiente muy buen servicio super contenta todo muy bueno excelente</li>
    <li> ladies, I have a tendency to get cellulitis on my legs very painful cannot use electric shavers or disposables, I love this there is not cutting fantastic wish I would have bought it sooner</li>
    <li> I bought the model above that one, last year, and it turns out that this one is exactly the same product, without a bunch of accessories that are frankly, of very little use. This one is half the price...&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This in the first time I use something like this, it is amazing how it works.&lt;br /&gt; is painful but It is word it. I use to use the razor but I got tier of scratching my skin over and over. and a friend recommend me the laser one but it is way expensive and it is the same as a Epilator.&lt;br /&gt;the only think is that I would like it to come with more accessories.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever heard of or used this type of product. I used it and am loving it. I have never had my legs stay so smooth and hairless for sooooo long. I love the fact I can use it in the bath tub. If you have ever had a tattoo this is kinda what it feels like, only without having to go over it a bunch of times. It is uncomfortable at first then you get used to it. You have hairs that grow at a different rate so for one week I used it every  two days and now It has been over a week and still don&#x27;t need it.</li>
    <li> It is all its promised to be. Using it in water makes it less painful. It does jot provide the same effect as waxing but it is much more convenient</li>
