      <li>Yes this product works very fast to provide you with all the hair food your hair will need to be fabulous!  </li>
      <li>I bought this product at my local beauty salon and it did wonders to my hair, it certainly did all that it said it would and more, love love love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>This is a great product if you have really dry hair like I do.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels so soft and has nice movement - but it still retains body.  </li>
      <li>The scent is okay, but I far prefer unscented products.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>After using it I decided it was worth every penny--</li>
      <li>this product is worth its weight in gold</li>
      <li>I love the smell and when I straight my hair it leaves it really soft.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very light and makes your hair silky, easy to comb and prevents them from being heavy or oily.</li>
      <li>I keep going back for more.</li>
      <li>First time ever trying the Biosilk Silk Therapy 17 Miracle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several years now and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I have used so many different hair products (none worked) and bought this on whim.</li>

      <li>I workout daily and need something to keep my hair up to par and this is like a magic potion.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery!</li>
      <li>The first time I brought this was at TJmaxx for 9.99</li>

      <li>I will definitely purchase more.</li>
      <li>I have long, very fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Product works very well.  </li>
      <li>(I have a very oily scalp).</li>
      <li>it did absolutely nothing for my hair ...</li>
      <li>but it can make you hair a bit greasy if you use too much.</li>
      <li>really like this product</li>
      <li>However, this spray in is so much easier</li>
      <li>It also makes my hair feel much thicker.</li>
      <li>It is so much easier to run heating tools over your hair after using it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy and makes your hair so much softer and smoother.</li>
      <li>Love the product but delivery took longer than expected.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always looking for natural products to better my hair while I was looking for different hair products and searching up ingredients to avoid this conditioner</li>
      <li>:) I use very little of this in my hair as too much would give a greasy look!</li>
      <li>I have tried different conditioners since my favorite, of a different company, was discontinued.  </li>
      <li>After untwisting my hair to set my curls--I sprayed the Therapy 17 into it...and WOW!!  </li>
      <li>My hair feels silky soft and very manageable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m placing an order for few more bottles...</li>
      <li>I put it on before my normal hair product.  </li>
      <li>Definitely LOVE IT and will continue to buy it and recommend it for people with dry, damaged, rough hair or people who use hot tools on their hair often.</li>
      <li>I actually have it on right now</li>
      <li>My hair is dull and coarse now that it&#x27;s dry, without the \\&quot;incredible shine\\&quot; or softness promised on the bottle, and the \\&quot;frizzies\\&quot; are still here as though I hadn&#x27;t conditioned at all.</li>
      <li>I live in SUPER DRY in the winter Minnesota.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was the product I ordered. Love this leave in conditioner, pricey, but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This product is the most amazing stuff you could ever use!!!!  You will just love what it does for your hair.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have ever used. I get my hair heavily highlighted every couple of months and straighten my hair about 4 times a week. In short, my hair is overworked. This stuff is awesome! It keeps my hair from looking like straw. Worth every penny. I stocked up by buying 5 bottles off of Amazon. They are always out of it at the beauty supply stores I visit.</li>
    <li> i have fine hair that tends to break off at the ends easily this stuff has not only stopped the slit-ends and breakage but has conditioned my hair from using well water. this product is worth its weight in gold i tell you. if you have dry hard to condition hair you need this stuff.</li>
    <li> interesting product with a sprayer.&lt;br /&gt;unexpected. so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;hope the sprayer holds up</li>
    <li> I have used the Biosilk serum in the past, but this is my first time using the Therapy 17 Leave In Treatment spray.    I wear my hair in natural twisty / springy curls that use to frizz up sometimes.  After untwisting my hair to set my curls--I sprayed the Therapy 17 into it...and WOW!!  My curls are not only practically frizz-free, but they look VERY hydrated without feeling sticky.  I&#x27;m placing an order for few more bottles...this is a terrific product!</li>
    <li> This is truly a miracle product. It was given to be as a gift from my hair stylist when she saw how dry and damaged my hair was from coloring and straightening. You spray it in your wet hair, comb it through, and style as usual. I saw results immediately- soft, silky, and no frizz. After using it, nothing even compares. I&#x27;ve bought several bottles over the last year and am ordering another now. This is a great price compared to many salons ($15 on average). I saw a couple of reviews that said it left hair sticky and hard to brush through- from my experience, you would have to spray way too much of this product to cause those kind of results. I have medium length, fine, frizzy, and slightly wavy hair. 2-4 pumps is all it takes. GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I workout daily and need something to keep my hair up to par and this is like a magic potion. Its not heavy and it keeps my ends from splitting.</li>
    <li> Product works very well.  Only reason I gave it four stars is that it tends to be a little heavy on my hair.</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner works great for my fine curly freazy hair. for the wet look or just to blow dry it.</li>
    <li> The best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used, it&#x27;s lightweight and keeps my hair moisturized  When I could no longer find it in the stores, I turned to Amazon &amp; I  am so glad they have it</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this the last time I had my hair cut when I told her I have a problem with frizziness. I have long, waist-length hair that gets frizzy in humidity. She pitched it as a miracle cure that could even be used as a lotion for dry skin. I fell for it and got a bottle (at the salon price). There&#x27;s nothing miraculous about this product. I&#x27;m underwhelmed, to say the least, and I&#x27;m not sure why I would have had an experience so different from those of the other reviewers. The things they said about the Silk Therapy 17 is what it was sold to me as, and what I&#x27;d expected. Instead, it&#x27;s heavy and sticky. The scent is okay, but I far prefer unscented products. My hair feels like it needs a good, thorough washing, and I just clarified this morning before applying the Biosilk. My hair WAS easier to comb through when wet after I applied the spray, but now that it&#x27;s dry I&#x27;m having to exert effort to drag the brush through my hair. Usually the brush slips through my hair easily. My hair is dull and coarse now that it&#x27;s dry, without the \\&quot;incredible shine\\&quot; or softness promised on the bottle, and the \\&quot;frizzies\\&quot; are still here as though I hadn&#x27;t conditioned at all. I will never buy this product again. It&#x27;s NOTHING like what I thought I was buying. It&#x27;s also the last time I buy any products from a salon.</li>
    <li> I should have returned this product immediately after using it ... my hair is extremely frizzy to begin with ... especially in the summer time with the humid weather ... it did absolutely nothing for my hair ... when stepping outdoors I looked like I had stuck my hand in a socket!  I tried a few times using this product but it just didn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> Few hours after applying, hair dries.  After using two times, i see lot of hair fall.   Alcohol based. Did not suit my dry hair. Wont reccomend to dry hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast delivery! Did I mention it makes your hair smell so good all day? I literally had people at my office walk by and ask if that was my hair that smelled so good. I diluted some in a water bottle and sprayed it on my Maltipoo and it has lasted over a week!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to everybody with every hair type and ethnic persuasion.  The best leave in product I have tried in years.  I&#x27;m a convert forever.</li>
    <li> This leave in conditioner is awesome! In the winter my hair gets uncontrollable, flies everywhere. I also use to have these dry patch in my hair, frizz. That&#x27;s all gone now. The bottle is small but don&#x27;t worry, you don&#x27;t have to use much so it goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I started using Silk Therapy 17 several years ago at the suggestion of my stylist. I was reluctant to try it, thinking it was too pricy. After using it I decided it was worth every penny--and then some. My hair is long, thick, dark brown turning to white, and is many textures--some straight, some curly. I am also allergic to most shampoos and almost every conditioner I&#x27;ve tried. Because Silk Therapy 17 goes on after I&#x27;m out of the shower and it&#x27;s a leave in conditioner--it doesn&#x27;t get on my scalp. The trick is to remember it doesn&#x27;t take much of Silk Therapy 17 to condition your hair--way less than you&#x27;d think. Now I can condition--and my hair is the best it&#x27;s ever been. I cannot praise it highly enough.</li>
    <li> I ordered Biosilk Silk Therapy 17 Miracle Leave In Conditioner, but what I received was Biosilk Silk Therapy Serum.  I was disappointed, but wasn&#x27;t going to thru the hassle of a return and accruing shipping charges.</li>
    <li> First time ever trying the Biosilk Silk Therapy 17 Miracle. LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!!!  LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will be ordering again.. I have used the shampoo and conditioner along with the oil. Wonderful stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! It works great, adds shine, makes hair feel soft, drys hair quicker and smells really good!! I have used bio silk for years on my thin waist length hair and it is fantastic!! :) I use very little of this in my hair as too much would give a greasy look! The bottle lasts awhile and is worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> The package is very small and I did not feel an improvement on my hair after using it. I did not like it.</li>
    <li> I have gray dry hair that gets &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34; when its dry. I use Biosilk Leave in condition every time after showering to keep my hair silky soft. It protects my dry hair from further damage. in the summer I spray my hair a second time when it is dry so it stays down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter dyes her hair regularly and also uses this product to protect and keep her hair silky soft.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I was introduced to it one day by my hairstylist, who recommended this product to me, as someone who washes her hair nearly every day (I have a very oily scalp). My hair has never been so soft - I use a small dollop each morning after my shower. While it may seem a little pricey - this bottle lasts forever. I just recently had to buy a replacement for the bottle I had for at least a year (probably longer) - and I have very long hair.</li>
    <li> I already used this product in the past but thought I would try to find it on line at a better price and I did!</li>
    <li> I live in SUPER DRY in the winter Minnesota.  I have long, very fine hair.  I could not find anything to keep the flyaways down in this extremely dry climate.  I have used Biosilk silk therapy for a long time and it helped some but it&#x27;s so dry here that one day I got desperate and I tried using regular conditioner, then 5 minute leave in and rinse out treatment, then Biosilk and two other leave in conditioners all in the same day and I STILL had flyaways.  We&#x27;re talking five conditioners!!!!  I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot.  It is amazing, I put it in my wet hair after washing (I sprayed it into my hands and rubbed it in because it&#x27;s hard to get in evenly by spraying directly on hair) and I had NO FLYAWAYS at all!!!  All day!  I am so amazed by this.  And my hair was not weighed down or greasy feeling which can happen with things like Moroccan oil.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this!</li>
    <li> I am a hispanic 23 year old woman who has been fighting with her hair for as long as I can remember. I have wavy/curly thick hair and I have never been able to leave my hair natural because my curls become a frizzy poufy mess if I let my hair air dry. I have used so many different hair products (none worked) and bought this on whim. I spritzed it on my hair after towel drying and let it dry naturally. My curls were beautiful! Perfectly defined, no frizz in sight. Even when I woke up the next morning my curls were still in place. My hair was not stiff or greasy and it smelled great! I will never go back, I feel like I have found a miracle product. I am hooked!</li>
    <li> The best!!  Detangles, smooth&#x27;s hair nicely!</li>
    <li> Love the product but delivery took longer than expected. Lesson to me to buy before I run out.  Biosilk hard to find where I live.</li>
    <li> Miracle!  Yes this product works very fast to provide you with all the hair food your hair will need to be fabulous!  I&#x27;m sold and will always utilize it in the future</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and it helps tame the frizz.  I put it on before my normal hair product.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Best product.  Haven&#x27;t found anything comparable and it&#x27;s good on hair extensions as well.</li>
    <li> Amazing leave in treatment. I must have.</li>
    <li> Biosilk Silk Therapy 17 Miracle Leave in Conditioner is on my list of top conditioners. I noticed a difference in my hair upon the first use. I will definitely purchase more.</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner by chance on sale at retail store. It smells amazing! Makes my hair incredible shine. Definitely will buy again. Great product!</li>
    <li> The last time I went to my hairdresser, my normally curly hair was blown-dry fairly straight and was so soft.  I used a couple of the styling products he recommended, but was unable to replicate the same soft feel.  I read the reviews of Biosilk Miracle and decided to give it a try.  WOW!  I spray this in my hair, comb through, and then use my styling products.  My hair feels so soft and has nice movement - but it still retains body.  It does not weigh my hair down.  I am very happy with this product and plan to continue using and buying it.</li>
    <li> After a summer of swimming in the ocean as well as our pool, my hair was done. Stick a fork in it. After using this product a few weeks, I have noticed an improvement. My hair is not as dry and brittle, much shiner as well. Great product, and a fe drops is all I need for my medium length hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried different conditioners since my favorite, of a different company, was discontinued.  I have used the other Bio-Silk products and been very happy with them.  However, this spray in is so much easier and you use very little of the product.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and this conditioner really seems to hold the curls and control the frizz due to the humidity, which is rampant in the south.</li>
    <li> I use this conditioner every morning after my shower. It is so nice to spray in and leave. My hair feels silky soft and very manageable. It also makes my hair feel much thicker. My husband also uses the product. I would recommend this conditioner to both men and women.</li>
    <li> Works great! Happy customer!</li>
    <li> The first time I brought this was at TJmaxx for 9.99 I&#x27;m always looking for natural products to better my hair while I was looking for different hair products and searching up ingredients to avoid this conditioner was the only one in which didn&#x27;t have such harmful chemicals I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year now (one bottle goes I long way) I actually have it on right now I love the smell and when I straight my hair it leaves it really soft. Is way too pricey here but over all I think is a good product</li>
    <li> I love using it on my skin and my hair. It leaves both of them so soft. My hair is so manageable now</li>
    <li> Wonderfully light scent. Product leaves my hair soft and tangle free. Love it! I would buy again anytime I have the chance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years now and absolutely love it. I use it on towel dried hair after washing it, all you need is a few pumps and it goes a long way. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy and makes your hair so much softer and smoother. It is so much easier to run heating tools over your hair after using it. I can definitely notice the difference in my hair on days that I don&#x27;t use it. I tried the Biosilk SERUM as well when I ran out of this leave in conditioner, I like that as well but it can make you hair a bit greasy if you use too much. I don&#x27;t find that with the leave in conditioner. I like this much better. Definitely LOVE IT and will continue to buy it and recommend it for people with dry, damaged, rough hair or people who use hot tools on their hair often.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you have really dry hair like I do.  Plus color treated, frizz, natural curly.  A little goes a long way.  I use this on wet hair and it makes my hair really soft.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy hair this works get apply to wet hair and style as usual or if you are at the beach or pool just apply a lot to the ends and leave in for the day.</li>
    <li> only conditioner that works well.</li>
    <li> I love the biosilk product but when I opened my box it was in, it had spilled all in my packaging. Therefore I only had about 1/3 to 1/2 of my biosilk left in the bottle.</li>
    <li> I use this product as a quick moisturizer to refresh my curls and tame my hairline instead of using gel. It softens, doesn&#x27;t build up and is a light texture. This is one of the staples in my beauty routine.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at my local beauty salon and it did wonders to my hair, it certainly did all that it said it would and more, love love love this conditioner. I just can never run out of this stuff. I keep going back for more. Most of the people that wrote bad review must have gotten a fake bottle or something, because this leave - in conditioner is amazing.</li>
    <li> helps repair your hair. really like this product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product, I used to buy it from my hairdresser in Switzerland. Happy to find it here.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very light and makes your hair silky, easy to comb and prevents them from being heavy or oily.</li>
    <li> love it works great on my hair</li>
