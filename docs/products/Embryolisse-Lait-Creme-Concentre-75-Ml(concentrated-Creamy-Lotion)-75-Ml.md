      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>but I recommend this face moisturizer :)</li>
      <li>Was really looking forward to this after all the great reviews both here and you tube.</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>and they fell in love as well.  </li>
      <li>Saw it on Pixiwoo and I love it.</li>
      <li>the more I used it.</li>
      <li>I use it every night, before going to bed and the nest day my skin is really smooth!</li>
      <li>I love love this product.  </li>
      <li>When I first started using this moistertizer I LOVED it.</li>
      <li>When you do, the experience becomes a double joy.</li>
      <li>and I get a fantastic smooth and hydrated feel at touch.</li>
      <li>Great for winter when the skin needs extra moisture!</li>
      <li>This creme leaves skin feeling velvety smooth.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin smooth and not oily at all.  </li>
      <li>I love this product; It is very gentle on the skin.</li>
      <li>and I have noticed that my concealer blends so much better if I use this first.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s now been 9 yrs since that first recommendation, and I haven&#x27;t found a better product.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves skin feeling smooth and moisturized.</li>
      <li>It applies light, but super moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>It is a great product for dry skin.</li>
      <li>For the most part they were all positive.</li>
      <li>It feels delicious going on your skin and leaves your skin feeling soft and velvety for a long time.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Maybe if I lived in France, I would use the line alot since it would be more reasonably</li>
      <li>What I like most is that it absorbs immediately - no greasiness - and there is absolutely zero scent.  </li>
      <li>I really would like to get more</li>
      <li>My skin quickly absorbes it</li>
      <li>Scent was too strong and I had intense burning around my eyes and mouth.</li>
      <li>I love to travel with a smaller bottle because you can use this as an all over hydrating cream (great for dry air on a plane), but you can also use it as a cream face wash, an overnight hydrating mask, eye makeup remover, cuticle cream, hair pomade, and in a pinch you can use it as a shaving cream.</li>
      <li>This seems like nothing special at first but the way it soaks into the skin is unlike anything I have ever used before.  </li>
      <li>Your whole face will feel simply fantastic, truly a noticeable difference.</li>
      <li>If the veterans of the makeup industry consistently use a product, you know that it is worth the buy.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m certainly buying it again!</li>
      <li>Use it first thing in the morning and before bed.</li>
      <li>First of all, it spreads like whipped cream.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, am on my 3rd tube of it and haven&#x27;t looked to another moisturizer since!</li>
      <li>At first I thought it would leave my skin oily, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>This product really feels good going on, serves as a great base for applying makeup, and it really does remove makeup very well.</li>
      <li>I was surprised to find it so reasonably priced (although through the years the priced has crept up - but not crazily so).  </li>
      <li>for daily lotion and before/after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is also good, it does not have strong fragrance but subtle.</li>
      <li>I have very oily, blemish prone skin</li>
      <li>You will see and feel a real difference around the eyes and throat.</li>
      <li>Originally bought in Paris and this was my second one ordered on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I find Alba Jasmine &amp; vitamin E cream very effective and half the price if a little lighter.</li>
      <li>try something new.</li>
      <li>This makes skin look dewy fresh, soft and younger.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much, so a tube will last quite some time.  </li>
      <li>do like this cream, but for the price, I dont know if I would buy it again as I think there are other creams for less money and just as effective.  </li>
      <li>I would not recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have since given it to my 21 yr old daughter and my 24 yr old daughter-in-law</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed the wrinkles around my eyes have diminished considerably since I started using it.</li>
      <li>My 80 yr old mother-in-law from France has been using this cream all her life.  </li>
      <li>It leaves it soft and dewy without feeling greasy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just what I expected and would recommend it to everyone who wants to have a decent makeup products.</li>
      <li>I have finished a complete tube and on my second one.</li>
      <li>Apparently, this a cult product in France</li>
      <li>It is very soothing, and especially in the winter when you are battling dry, flaky skin this cream is a life saver.</li>
      <li>My skin feels so soft now in contrast to before where it was dry and scaly (ew!).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this stuff, am on my 3rd tube of it and haven&#x27;t looked to another moisturizer since! Amen! Dont rub it in, rather apply on your face in upward stroke and let sink in. My face has never been healthier, dewier, or softer!</li>
    <li> I bought this product, but I did not believe it was going to be as good as it is! I have a combination skin and rosacea! I use it every night, before going to bed and the nest day my skin is really smooth! Love it and I will definitely buy it again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it is so great!  I get compliments on my skin constantly.  Feels great and it works!</li>
    <li> I was going to buy an expensive item from Ulta and three times smaller than this item. Saw it on Pixiwoo and I love it.</li>
    <li> Was really looking forward to this after all the great reviews both here and you tube. Scent was too strong and I had intense burning around my eyes and mouth. The day after I had a crusty rash on my face. I would not recommend for sensitive skin. Wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> Good good moisturizer.  It applies light, but super moisturizing.  It&#x27;s unscented and doesn&#x27;t break me out.  I have finished a complete tube and on my second one.</li>
    <li> This is a great face moisturizer! At first I thought it would leave my skin oily, but it didn&#x27;t. My skin quickly absorbes it and I get a fantastic smooth and hydrated feel at touch. Whenever my skin is irritaded or dull, this is the savior. As a makeup primer, it is almost as good as my smashbox! At night before sleep, this is fantastic, my skin looks great in the morning! I don&#x27;t like using it as a makeup remover as they say you can, but it doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t be done. I love this and I&#x27;m certainly buying it again!</li>
    <li> Such a staple, I wouldnt be without!</li>
    <li> I love this product; It is very gentle on the skin. I have an oily skin type still it didn&#x27;t make my skin feel oilier. It is perfect. Moisturizes thoroughly and makes the skin glow beautifully.</li>
    <li> I really would like to get more but it it just too expensive. I wish I could find it cheaper because nothing has ever worked so well on my skin.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer for the face was recommended to me years ago by a model in Paris.  She told me all the models were using it.  I was surprised to find it so reasonably priced (although through the years the priced has crept up - but not crazily so).  You don&#x27;t need to use very much, so a tube will last quite some time.  What I like most is that it absorbs immediately - no greasiness - and there is absolutely zero scent.  I use it twice a day after a shower and after washing my face before bedtime.  It&#x27;s now been 9 yrs since that first recommendation, and I haven&#x27;t found a better product.  I&#x27;m hardly a model but I recommend this face moisturizer :)</li>
    <li> I have fallen head over heels with the Embryolisse Lait Crème Concentré. I have very oily, blemish prone skin and I do not find this thick cream causes any breakouts or blockages. It is very soothing, and especially in the winter when you are battling dry, flaky skin this cream is a life saver. I love to travel with a smaller bottle because you can use this as an all over hydrating cream (great for dry air on a plane), but you can also use it as a cream face wash, an overnight hydrating mask, eye makeup remover, cuticle cream, hair pomade, and in a pinch you can use it as a shaving cream.</li>
    <li> My skin drinks this stuff in every morning and night.  It leaves it soft and dewy without feeling greasy.  I&#x27;ve noticed the wrinkles around my eyes have diminished considerably since I started using it.</li>
    <li> brilliant on all skin types, great for make up removal, fab moisturizer, excellant primer under foundation , i love it , i have dry skin</li>
    <li> Apparently, this a cult product in France so I was eager to try it. It seems to be an average moisturizing lotion. I don&#x27;t think it does miracle for me.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the quality! Read about it on an article and decided to give it a try, luchky me!</li>
    <li> This product really feels good going on, serves as a great base for applying makeup, and it really does remove makeup very well. If the veterans of the makeup industry consistently use a product, you know that it is worth the buy. I purchased one for my kit and one for personal use. I don&#x27;t regret it at all.</li>
    <li> I love love this product.  It&#x27;s not greasy at all. I use it morning &amp; night time.  It leaves my skin smooth and not oily at all.  I will definitely purchase it again!!!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive/dry skin and this stuff does not break me out! It leaves my skin feeling supple and hydrated. Great for winter when the skin needs extra moisture!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;l so happy I bought this product. It&#x27;s just what I expected and would recommend it to everyone who wants to have a decent makeup products. Great base for any type of skins.</li>
    <li> This is perfect moisturizer  under makeup. It softens and sooth skin. My husband likes it too. Its good to use after shaving on the face.</li>
    <li> I fell for the hype and tried this.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  It is indeed a very nice, rich, unctuous moisturizer.  It feels delicious going on your skin and leaves your skin feeling soft and velvety for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a minute for it to sink in.  Very nice light smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: I dont get what all the hype is about.  It is nice but nothing earth shattering.  It is on the expensive side.&lt;br /&gt;I hate the metal tube because you cant get all the product at the end.  I would prefer the cream in a jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like this cream, but for the price, I dont know if I would buy it again as I think there are other creams for less money and just as effective.  Maybe if I lived in France, I would use the line alot since it would be more reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt; I find Alba Jasmine &amp; vitamin E cream very effective and half the price if a little lighter.</li>
    <li> This seems like nothing special at first but the way it soaks into the skin is unlike anything I have ever used before.  This will be a lifelong staple for me.  Its even great on my lips</li>
    <li> I got a small sample of this product and after a week of using it I ordered a large tube of it. First of all, it spreads like whipped cream. It absorbs quickly and leaves skin feeling smooth and moisturized. The quality of my skin has improved after only using this for a bit over a week. It works really well as a base coat for makeup and I have noticed that my concealer blends so much better if I use this first. My skin feels so soft now in contrast to before where it was dry and scaly (ew!). I totally recommend this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One weird thing though--after every time I use it my skin perspires visibly, especially on my nose. It&#x27;s not a huge deal and I figure that it is cleaning out my pores a bit, but it is odd. After a minute or two of putting this one there are small little dots of moisture all over my nose. I wonder if anyone else has noticed this--let me know in the comments if you have because I am curious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of this strange quirk, I still give this 5 stars. Best moisturizer I have ever used! :)</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before buying this product.  For the most part they were all positive. When I first started using this moistertizer I LOVED it. I actually looked forward to putting it on in the morning. Before using this I had never in my life had skin issues. I just wanted to upgrade my moisterizer...try something new. I will say that it is not greasy feeling. It is thick and a very small amount goes a long way. In fact I bought this in September and it is now March. I started noticing my skin getting dry after a month or two. I assumed it was just because the weather changed and it was getting colder. The tube it is in is thin metal so once you start running out you have to squeeze it and roll it up...like the toothpaste tube.  When I did that it opened and the moisterizer came out of the side. It&#x27;s not a big deal, but one morning I didn&#x27;t feel like dealing with it. I had bought my boyfriend the moisterizer that I used before this so I decided to use that instead. That is when I realized Embryolisse was the cause of my dry flaky skin. I mean it was getting worse and worse the more I used it. Personally I will not use this moisterizer again nor will I recommend it. Everyone will not get the same results, but I do want to warn you. If you try this product and your skin starts getting dry stop using it and save yourself time. I really hate having to leave a bad review, which I have never done before, but I wanted to let others aware.</li>
    <li> It is a great product for dry skin. I have oily skin and some times it can fell a little so oily.</li>
    <li> At times, you can find a good deal on this. When you do, the experience becomes a double joy. This creme leaves skin feeling velvety smooth. Use it first thing in the morning and before bed. You will see and feel a real difference around the eyes and throat. Your whole face will feel simply fantastic, truly a noticeable difference. I have used it for over a year and don&#x27;t want to be without it. No more dry skin for me. This makes skin look dewy fresh, soft and younger.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer non greasy, good value a little goes a long way. Use it for face as well as hands.</li>
    <li> Very good lotion for winter time.&lt;br /&gt;Useful for daily lotion and before/after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is also good, it does not have strong fragrance but subtle.</li>
    <li> My 80 yr old mother-in-law from France has been using this cream all her life.  Her skin is amazing!  I asked her 6 months ago what she uses.  She left me the remainder of her tube.  I began using it and fell in love with the cream!  I had her send me some from France.  I recently had lunch with a friend who is a PA for a dermatologist and she asked me what I was doing different.  I have since given it to my 21 yr old daughter and my 24 yr old daughter-in-law and they fell in love as well.  I liked it so well I had thought of importing it but see someone has beat me to it.  Trust me just try it and make your own decision!  You will be hooked!</li>
    <li> I have been happy with the texture and scent, wish it had SPF but works well for bedtime. Originally bought in Paris and this was my second one ordered on Amazon. Handy.</li>
