      <li>It goes beyond itchy dry skin  relief and really seems to diminish signs of eczema, when used according to the directions.</li>

    <li> I got this cr&amp;egrave;me yesterday, and I used it right away for an itchy spot that has been bothering me on my shin.  It took the itch away immediately, and it is cool feeling, as well as a very light lotion that spreads easily.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to order and receive.  This amount of words does not make sense to me.  I do not have extra time</li>
    <li> i like this stuff. pretty solid for the itch the eczema gives me on my neck and forearms. i recently cut out certain foods from my diet. hopefully it stops the flare ups so i can lay off the topical steroids.</li>
    <li> works well thank you.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, it&#x27;s the only thing that clears up my eczema within a days time.</li>
    <li> Cannot find this in the local store but it works really well for me. Worth the money. Will order again.</li>
    <li> This worked great on my eczema. I will definitely keep it on hand for future flairs. Just wish it came in a different container; this one wastes quite a bit unless you cut the tube apart with scissors to get at the last of it.</li>
    <li> I brought this cream because of a rash, (eczema) and I thought eczema cream would work better, but it helped me the same as their original cortisone 10 cream.  In fairness to the cream, I have just started using it, but I still believe I could have just brought the regular cortisone 10 cream.</li>
    <li> After trying several prescription medications, I switched to this. Much better results and certainly cheaper. I will keep using this as needed</li>
    <li> I have bought this product for my daughter a couple of times to help with her Eczema issues. We have found that it helps a lot on small spots on the body, such as hands and feet. We have not used it in larger spots as we use a different special lotion for that. I would recommend this product for anyone with Eczema.</li>
    <li> Great product that really works and its even strong enough to stop the itching and there is no burning afterwords.</li>
    <li> This lotion is a lifesaver! It really helps immediately relieve the intense itching I get sometimes with my eczema. Even when it feels like I could scratch my skin off...I put this on and bam--no more itchy skin! This stuff really works. And it comes in a good size container (bigger than the normal cortisone over-the-counter tubes!).</li>
    <li> This really works!! It goes beyond itchy dry skin  relief and really seems to diminish signs of eczema, when used according to the directions.</li>
    <li> Cortizone 10 intensive healing lotion delivers as promised, but be aware that it should be put on after each hand washing.  I will buy again.  Thanks</li>
    <li> For most kinds of insect bites, such as mosquitoes, and for dryness/itchiness, I do highly recommend this lotion as the best that I have found.</li>
    <li> Good anti-itch product. This particular size is the most economical I have found.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the BOMB! Very effective in stopping the itches on my dry skin.  After all these years trying different creams and lotions I finally found one that really works for me. I highly recommend Cortizone 10.  Just wish it came in a larger size tube.</li>
    <li> Both of my calves have the same spot where they uncontrolably itch all the flocking time!  I tried everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin type is dry.  However my lower legs are the only place that I itch.  Finally I don&#x27;t have to anymore.</li>
    <li> As many other reviewers have mentioned, this cream works wonders. It is better then any other eczema cream I have tried. If you are on the fence, try it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I never post reviews. I will make an exception in this case.  This stuff really works. The trick is, to use consistently.</li>
    <li> Both my son and daughter had periodic episodes of eczema when they were infants.  My wife tried 3 different eczema cremes and they did not work.  Cortizone 10 was the only thing that worked for our children.  I have to give it 5 stars for this.  As we all know, people are people and respond differently to treatments.  What works for one person may not necessarily work for another, but this creme worked wonders for our family.</li>
    <li> This product is so great.  My little guy (6 months) has very dry, patchy skin.  The pedi said it&#x27;s eczema and to use a little OTC hydracortisone on the worst places, but he just had too much to smear a salve around.  This lotion is so great.  Smooth and easy to spread, and it works like a charm.  I even put a little on his bald head where he has a mix of cradle cap and eczema.  It obviously won&#x27;t clear up the cradle cap, but it cleared the rest and stopped him from rubbing his head on his crib mattress, probably to relieve the itching.  I&#x27;ll be buying this again and again...  : )</li>
    <li> Very good lotion, very effective</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything for Eczema because I&#x27;ve never experienced it before... This is the solution to quick healing, one day and it was gone, no more itch. kudos to Cortizone-10!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I have been using it for Eczema, and it remains effective.  The price was right and the arrival time was really graat.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty good, my symptoms are alot better and I am very thankful for the good reviews on this OTC Eczema treatment, it is definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> My 2 year old suffers from Eczema and after trying 20+ products this is the one that worked for her. I am so happy she&#x27;s not scratching her legs and arms anymore! After just a few applications her redness, dryness, itchiness went away. I will def buy it again. I just wish they would sell a bigger tube since this one is small. Love this product and love seeing my daughter&#x27;s legs smooth again!</li>
    <li> 5 stars especially for the price! Heals within daysof using it.highly recommend this product for people with eczema and/itchy skin</li>
    <li> Must have!  Works wonders on eczema!</li>
    <li> The cream feels great, but I don&#x27;t think it has what it takes for severe eczema.  My daughter and I both have it pretty bad. This cleared it up enough to stop the pain, but it never went away completely.</li>
