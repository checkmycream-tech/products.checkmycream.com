      <li>The first and still the best of the charcoal washes.</li>
      <li>I get many compliments on my skin now!</li>
      <li>and I simply love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>Seriously a great product, no annoying scent and makes skin feel/look nice.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing.</li>
      <li>It has been my favorite for years and a MUST after a good gym work</li>
      <li>This is the most moisturizing soap I have found, which makes it good for both face and body.  </li>
      <li>This body wash is wonderful for sensitive skin issues.</li>
      <li>It would be nice if there was more lather &amp; a stronger fragrance</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product: natural, lathers well, and works...especially on acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>I love it &amp; would recommend it.</li>
      <li>I truly love this ptoduct.</li>
      <li>I used another charcoal wash from giovanni and did did not like it at all, but I love this one.</li>
      <li>It is soothing &amp; refreshing.</li>
      <li>love this soap for after swimming</li>
      <li>Very rich and cleanses well.</li>
      <li>But, it wipes away easily.  </li>
      <li>Very natural with good ingredients.</li>
      <li>This is a good natural product.</li>
      <li>, odor is really clean and neutral, it can be used both by men and women.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, has a pleasant scent but not overpowering, and leaves my skin feeling very clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it for my sensitive skin and nose..  </li>
      <li>but overall I liked it.</li>
      <li>For me, this product is worth its weight in gold.  </li>
      <li>This soap smells amazing -- leaves skin clean but not too dried out.</li>
      <li>judging by the darkness, it contains more active charcoal than others,but rinses clean with no problem, I could tell right away after drying off that the zinc was soothing my skin.</li>
      <li>Since it is charcoal based, it will temporarily stain wash cloths, but I wash all towels &amp; wash cloths on an extended, hot wash, anyway, so that isn&#x27;t a problem for me.</li>
      <li>Additionally, I have sensitive skin, prone to hives from fragrances and most new soaps I try.  </li>
      <li>It leaved the skin clean and really soft, you don&#x27;t need to pour a large amount of this product in your hand/towel or whatever</li>
      <li>I really like the way it feels in my skin</li>
      <li>and I really like the smell.</li>
      <li>The smell is not irritating and doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
      <li>Charcoal, as I understand it, absorbs up all sorts leaving you feeling clean and fresh in a way that I just don&#x27;t from other body washes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This also makes it last longer which is good because it is relatively expensive compared to most soaps.</li>
      <li>It just shows more (when some falls to the bottom of the shower or when on a washcloth) than regular white soap</li>
      <li>While this is not necessarily a nice &amp;#34;looking&amp;#34; soap (it is actually black - it&#x27;s made from charcoal) - it is a very nice &amp;#34;smelling&amp;#34; soap -- I was told to use it by my doctor during a long hot soak in the bath to help combat micotoxic poisoning from mold --</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t in any way irritate my mildly sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I now use it instead of woolite for my dark delicates, and it works much better than any other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; laundry cleaning product I have used - including soap nuts.</li>
      <li>Prior to that, my skin on my neck and back had mysterious splotches, very superficial, but discolored - for nearly 20 years.  </li>
      <li>I am sensitive to perfume and any other chemicals that show up in products and really like all the collective well being products.</li>
      <li>It is black, when it first comes out of the bottle, but as you create suds, it turns white, and I have not had any problem with staining.  </li>
      <li>Particularly for active people, this is the body wash for you.</li>
      <li>It is strange at first because it is black, but it does not stain anything as another reviewer mentioned.  </li>

    <li> Love it!  Wish it was still made!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about this soap.  Although I buy free-range chicken and eat organic veggies, I was not sure that an all natural body wash would remove odors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happily, I have been using this body wash for several weeks and I am very satisfied.  I previously used Dial Anti-Bacterial Body Wash to remove odors from sensitive regions, but this works just as well, if not better.  It is black, when it first comes out of the bottle, but as you create suds, it turns white, and I have not had any problem with staining.  Additionally, I have sensitive skin, prone to hives from fragrances and most new soaps I try.  This stuff is great!  There is no odor in my pits, and there are no bumps on my skin.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Very rich and cleanses well. Smells amazing. excellent product for the price.</li>
    <li> judging by the darkness, it contains more active charcoal than others,but rinses clean with no problem, I could tell right away after drying off that the zinc was soothing my skin. I didn&#x27;t realize until after it arrived that it contained tea tree oil to provide anti microbial properties, and sesame seed oil to moisturize a bit. Also it smell great during shower, like grapefuit-lemon.</li>
    <li> Have used this soap for several years.  I absolutely love it for my sensitive skin and nose..  It never irritates and also seems to slightly moisturize.  The smell is not irritating and doesn&#x27;t linger.  I now use it instead of woolite for my dark delicates, and it works much better than any other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; laundry cleaning product I have used - including soap nuts.</li>
    <li> This body wash is wonderful for sensitive skin issues. And it doesn&#x27;t smell like perfumes. It is also very good for diabetics skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I have been using Collective Wellbeing&#x27;s Charcoal Body Wash for over a year and I simply love it! Since it is charcoal based, it will temporarily stain wash cloths, but I wash all towels &amp; wash cloths on an extended, hot wash, anyway, so that isn&#x27;t a problem for me. My son has begun to use it and he likes it as well. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, has a pleasant scent but not overpowering, and leaves my skin feeling very clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Charcoal  collective wellbeing</li>
    <li> A wonderful product. Great for your skin</li>
    <li> This is a good natural product. It would be nice if there was more lather &amp; a stronger fragrance but overall I liked it.</li>
    <li> love this soap for after swimming</li>
    <li> This soap smells amazing -- leaves skin clean but not too dried out. Didn&#x27;t in any way irritate my mildly sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product: natural, lathers well, and works...especially on acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I have now used Collective Wellbeing Charcoal Body Wash for 5 years.  Prior to that, my skin on my neck and back had mysterious splotches, very superficial, but discolored - for nearly 20 years.  Doctors recommended cortisone creams, sulfate shampoos, anti-fungals - none of which cleared up this on and off problem.  A friend recommended this soap.  Since using it, the skin problem has NEVER returned.  For me, this product is worth its weight in gold.  I get many compliments on my skin now!</li>
    <li> Terrific product. The first and still the best of the charcoal washes. Very natural with good ingredients. I am sensitive to perfume and any other chemicals that show up in products and really like all the collective well being products. I used another charcoal wash from giovanni and did did not like it at all, but I love this one. I also use it as a deodorant, but placing a bit under my arms in the shower and letting it sit a bit then washing it off. Later, when drying off, I use a bit of the roll on Tom&#x27;s chrystal mineral on occasion.  good seller too.</li>
    <li> While this is not necessarily a nice &amp;#34;looking&amp;#34; soap (it is actually black - it&#x27;s made from charcoal) - it is a very nice &amp;#34;smelling&amp;#34; soap -- I was told to use it by my doctor during a long hot soak in the bath to help combat micotoxic poisoning from mold -- I won&#x27;t know if it works for that purpose until my next doctor&#x27;s appointment -- in the meantime, I like the soap and I really like the smell.</li>
    <li> This is the most moisturizing soap I have found, which makes it good for both face and body.  It is strange at first because it is black, but it does not stain anything as another reviewer mentioned.  It just shows more (when some falls to the bottom of the shower or when on a washcloth) than regular white soap does b/c it is black.  But, it wipes away easily.  I dilute it in half with water b/c it is very thick.  This also makes it last longer which is good because it is relatively expensive compared to most soaps.</li>
    <li> Particularly for active people, this is the body wash for you. It has been my favorite for years and a MUST after a good gym work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blackness of it can be off putting, I suppose. I remember years ago being concerned by it, but it doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to. The charcoal is particularly good for smell. Charcoal, as I understand it, absorbs up all sorts leaving you feeling clean and fresh in a way that I just don&#x27;t from other body washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside is it&#x27;s really not moisturizing. I actually find it rather drying and have started switching it off and on with a moisturizing body wash.</li>
    <li> I truly love this ptoduct. This is my second time ordering. This time i doubled my order because l&#x27;m afraid of running out.  It is soothing &amp; refreshing. I love it &amp; would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years now. A bottle lasts about a year! Seriously a great product, no annoying scent and makes skin feel/look nice.</li>
    <li> I really like the way it feels in my skin, odor is really clean and neutral, it can be used both by men and women. It leaved the skin clean and really soft, you don&#x27;t need to pour a large amount of this product in your hand/towel or whatever, it is really good. I will buy it again.</li>
