### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>myself - perfect</li>
      <li>Makes a perfect line every time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this thing now</li>
      <li>Great product, couldn&#x27;t do without it now!</li>
      <li>and then you&#x27;ll be happy with your purchase.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t think it would have been good.  </li>
      <li>Good idea</li>
      <li>but I already love it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been cutting/bleaching my own hair for almost 3 years.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll build and sell my own and not provide R&amp;D for these guys.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m super happy with how my hair line looks.  </li>
      <li>I love being able to trim my neck</li>
      <li>and this is better than cardboard.  </li>
      <li>She does a pretty good job but hates doing it and is a chore.  </li>
      <li>I have ideas, but it&#x27;s so easy to replicate</li>
      <li>You can build the same thing for free with cardboard and shape it more easily for your neck.</li>
      <li>I was actually going to make my own out of cardboard</li>
      <li>but prove is easy to high.</li>
      <li>I just last night used it for my third time and I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  </li>
      <li>I no longer need to put off haircuts until I have someone to help that I quite frankly don&#x27;t want helping in the first place.</li>
      <li>This process allows me to blend the back pretty evenly up to the top of the hair length.  </li>
      <li>The design and size are fine as they are for my big head.  </li>
      <li>Works better than expected</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no guarantee that I&#x27;m holding this guide straight.</li>
      <li>I have struggled to get my neckline straight for years.</li>
      <li>or I&#x27;d have to risk getting help from people I don&#x27;t trust to draw a straight line with clippers.  </li>
      <li>Basically this works just the same as a piece of cardboard, or a milk jug cut to fit.</li>
      <li>After I do the bottom hairline edge, I can move the Edgup product up vertically about an inch or two and use my clippers with a guard to trim the bottom, then move it up again higher, and put a higher number guard on my clippers and trim the next inch or two a littler higher.  </li>
      <li>I had problems lining up the back of my neckline for years, this resolved the problem with the first use.</li>
      <li>However I&#x27;ve always needed help such as my girlfriend to use my trimmers to clean up the back edge.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s designed so you can cut the edge with scissors as you see fit to round corners, shorten it, etc.</li>
      <li>Since you can&#x27;t see the back of your neck, make sure you go down far enough from the &amp;#34;Edgup&amp;#34; or you&#x27;ll have some strays</li>

<li> this thing is too expensive and it doesn&#x27;t even work!!</li>

    <li> Item as promised, arrived on time</li>
    <li> Basically this works just the same as a piece of cardboard, or a milk jug cut to fit. Problem was I still had to hold it with one hand while awkwardly using my other hand to hold my clippers. There&#x27;s no guarantee that I&#x27;m holding this guide straight. I could still mess my neck line up badly With this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simply a piece of plastic from China. You can build the same thing for free with cardboard and shape it more easily for your neck. The plastic is too thick to get up close to the line. I have ideas, but it&#x27;s so easy to replicate I&#x27;ll build and sell my own and not provide R&amp;D for these guys.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on DIY networks &amp;#34;I want that&amp;#34; show.  I had problems lining up the back of my neckline for years, this resolved the problem with the first use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair now for about 10 years, and every single time, I have needed someone else to do the back. It was one of those favors I always hated to ask for and also didn&#x27;t really trust anyone to do it well. FINALLY, a simple little product that lets me do it myself and no chance of messing up. Great product, couldn&#x27;t do without it now!</li>
    <li> this thing is too expensive and it doesn&#x27;t even work!! it keeps shacking and moving as a jelly, so hard to hold still</li>
    <li> This is made for the garbage it  does not work. where did you steal the idea for this pos ?</li>
    <li> Meh - $20 for a piece of curve plastic. I could have cut it out if a milk jug.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once but I already love it! I have struggled to get my neckline straight for years. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Good idea but prove is easy to high. I just use leather belt.</li>
    <li> Not sure how to use and cut at the same time. Would not recommend if you are expecting to use it by yourself.</li>
    <li> The product itself is very simple.  It&#x27;s a rubberized edge that is used while cutting the back of your own hair.  It&#x27;s designed so you can cut the edge with scissors as you see fit to round corners, shorten it, etc. I&#x27;ve been cutting/bleaching my own hair for almost 3 years.  After watching the stylists cut my hair and asking questions about bleach products and processes they are doing, I figured out how to do it myself.  And I&#x27;ve saved a ton. However I&#x27;ve always needed help such as my girlfriend to use my trimmers to clean up the back edge.  She does a pretty good job but hates doing it and is a chore.  So now I don&#x27;t have to bother her. I personally still have to use mirrors.. there is no way to know if I&#x27;m holding it crooked, and then I can use my trimmers/scissors to do the edge how I like.  I didn&#x27;t cut or customize the edgup product.  The design and size are fine as they are for my big head.  After I do the bottom hairline edge, I can move the Edgup product up vertically about an inch or two and use my clippers with a guard to trim the bottom, then move it up again higher, and put a higher number guard on my clippers and trim the next inch or two a littler higher.  This process allows me to blend the back pretty evenly up to the top of the hair length.  So it does what it should, it&#x27;s a simple edge to use as a guide.  I was actually going to make my own out of cardboard and I coincidentally saw this on dudeIwantThat and this is better than cardboard.  I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. I like it!</li>
    <li> Works better than expected</li>
    <li> I took my time to get to know the product before I wrote this.  I just last night used it for my third time and I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for a while now but this has always been a snag that either would look bad or I&#x27;d have to risk getting help from people I don&#x27;t trust to draw a straight line with clippers.  If i had to give any pointers they would be as follows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) To align it, hold it in the same spot on both sides and use your fingers to feel out an even spacing with your ears.  I find this the easiest way to do this as opposed to using multiple mirrors as I tried first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Since you can&#x27;t see the back of your neck, make sure you go down far enough from the &amp;#34;Edgup&amp;#34; or you&#x27;ll have some strays farther down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) When aligning, start high and slide it down, this will help make sure all your hairs are pointed down and you don&#x27;t get any random long ones that may have bent funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had reviewed this thing after one use, I don&#x27;t think it would have been good.  You need to invest a few haircuts of learning into it and then you&#x27;ll be happy with your purchase.  No fault to the folks at &amp;#34;edgup&amp;#34; it&#x27;s just a product that takes a getting used to since you&#x27;re unable to see it while in use.  I&#x27;m very happy with this thing now and I&#x27;m super happy with how my hair line looks.  I no longer need to put off haircuts until I have someone to help that I quite frankly don&#x27;t want helping in the first place.</li>
    <li> Just what is was looking for.  Makes a perfect line every time.</li>
    <li> I love being able to trim my neck myself - perfect</li>
    <li> who needs a barber with this.</li>
