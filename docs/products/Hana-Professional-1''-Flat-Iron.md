      <li>Lots of nice little extras included.  :-)</li>
      <li>Made the purchase well worth it</li>
      <li>This one is lose and doesn&#x27;t work right.</li>
      <li>If I can go to higher temp.</li>
      <li>I paid way too much!  </li>
      <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
      <li>Love these flat irons!</li>
      <li>It is cheaply made and never got hot enough!  </li>
      <li>The manual says for certain temps for certain textures and types use this temp.</li>
      <li>The company also sends you a bunch of random useful goodies which I loved.</li>
      <li>I had high expectations for the product itself, because I used my sister&#x27;s.</li>

      <li>The plastic feels cheap and the edges are rough, which snag my hair.</li>
      <li>, i bought this flat iron based on the ceramic surface, it works good but takes a long time compared to my babybliss flat iron (not ceramic) .</li>
      <li>I left on a trip right after</li>
      <li>the mat)&lt;br /&gt;I have owned many irons in the past</li>
      <li>that i read online its better to use the ceramic flat iron as it is less damaging</li>
      <li>Makes my hair soft and shiny too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always used a $30 flat iron and had to pass it 4-5times to get it straight while it ripped strands out.</li>
      <li>Hana Salon loaded their packaging with little gifts, like paper roses and lipstick to just make you feel special.</li>
      <li>I think for someone with fine hair, it will be okay, but if you have moderately thick or coarse hair, go ahead and pay a little extra for a GHD.</li>
      <li>however they were all titanium based , as my hair has become rough with so much color and hair-iron -ing,</li>

<li> Received this flat iron as a gift seven years ago and I&#x27;ve used it regularly since that time with no complaints or thoughts of switching.</li>
<li> It lasts at least 2 years and gets my curly, frizzy hair really straight.</li>

<li> I had the pink breast cancer one for 3 years</li>
<li> I should have spent my 140.00 on something else!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s nothing like the other hana iron I had before this one.</li>
<li> I have previously owned CHI, T3, and a GHD iron.</li>
<li> I have thick curly long hair and with 1 or maybe 2 passes, it straightened it.</li>
<li> I very much dislike it for some reason it keeps turning off on me too bad when I bought  </li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;cons: too long that my hand is tired after i finish.</li>
<li> Ignoring the cheesy &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34; in the packaging, this iron is pretty mediocre.</li>
<li> But isn&#x27;t blown away by it and doesn&#x27;t glide through her thick hair like her Chi did.</li>
<li> This product didn&#x27;t last and I&#x27;ve barely had a year they have gone out and how do u contact this company to exchange or get refund horrible product!!!</li>
<li> When my GHD was accidentally broken, I decided to try a HANA after hearing rave reviews from friends.</li>
<li> This was the worst flat iron I have ever purchased!  </li>
<li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <li> Got it for my wife and she love it, thanks a million</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t last and I&#x27;ve barely had a year they have gone out and how do u contact this company to exchange or get refund horrible product!!!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I have been ordering this one for years. It lasts at least 2 years and gets my curly, frizzy hair really straight. Love it and will keep using this brand. I highly recommend it to anyone. Makes my hair soft and shiny too.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t but this junk.</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for the product itself, because I used my sister&#x27;s. The actual purchasing experience was beyond expectations. Hana Salon loaded their packaging with little gifts, like paper roses and lipstick to just make you feel special. Iron works great. Very happy with this experience.</li>
    <li> I havent even had this 1 year yet and it just went out on me!!!</li>
    <li> I love it. I&#x27;ve always used a $30 flat iron and had to pass it 4-5times to get it straight while it ripped strands out. I have thick curly long hair and with 1 or maybe 2 passes, it straightened it. The company also sends you a bunch of random useful goodies which I loved. Made the purchase well worth it and I have recommended as it was recommended to me.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!&lt;br /&gt;THANK-YOU FOR FREE GIFTS</li>
    <li> Love these flat irons!</li>
    <li> This was the worst flat iron I have ever purchased!  I paid way too much!  It is cheaply made and never got hot enough!  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Received this flat iron as a gift seven years ago and I&#x27;ve used it regularly since that time with no complaints or thoughts of switching. Finally, after seven years, the electrical wiring has given out on me. That&#x27;s a great lifespan for a flat iron and I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I struggle getting the hair straight with comb and slow pulls. The manual says for certain temps for certain textures and types use this temp. If I can go to higher temp. I do and it&#x27;s easier but there&#x27;s a fear of the heat being to high for the hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE This product!!! I switched from CHI turbo by Faruk (spelling?) about two years ago. I&#x27;m now on my second Hana straightener. Their product is excellent. Their packaging is always beautiful, too. They always include something special! Last year, my box came with an angel ornament in it. It&#x27;s on my Christmas tree this year. :)</li>
    <li> Love it! This is my second one... the last one lasted for 5 years and I used it almost every day!</li>
    <li> I have had this flat iron for a while and feel I can now post a solid review. I have previously owned CHI, T3, and a GHD iron. When my GHD was accidentally broken, I decided to try a HANA after hearing rave reviews from friends. Ignoring the cheesy &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34; in the packaging, this iron is pretty mediocre. The plastic feels cheap and the edges are rough, which snag my hair. The plates are reasonably smooth, but it does not glide effortlessly through my hair like GHD and T3 irons do. I think for someone with fine hair, it will be okay, but if you have moderately thick or coarse hair, go ahead and pay a little extra for a GHD. I really wanted to love this iron, but it has been sent to the donation pile.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife after her Chi stopped working within a year of purchasing it. She likes the settings available, the mat and travel case. But isn&#x27;t blown away by it and doesn&#x27;t glide through her thick hair like her Chi did.</li>
    <li> I very much dislike it for some reason it keeps turning off on me too bad when I bought  I left on a trip right after and I miss the deadline to return it. NOT HAPPY and very much disapointed</li>
    <li> Its Okay, i did receive it with loads of goodies (however was not crazy abount any of the free stuff i received except for the mat)&lt;br /&gt;I have owned many irons in the past however they were all titanium based , as my hair has become rough with so much color and hair-iron -ing, that i read online its better to use the ceramic flat iron as it is less damaging, i bought this flat iron based on the ceramic surface, it works good but takes a long time compared to my babybliss flat iron (not ceramic) . also it does take a while to be fully hot.&lt;br /&gt;pros: it does result in silky hair&lt;br /&gt;cons: too long that my hand is tired after i finish.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nothing like the other hana iron I had before this one. I had the pink breast cancer one for 3 years and I loved it! This one is lose and doesn&#x27;t work right. It snags and pulls my hair and I have to run it through my hair several times. I should have spent my 140.00 on something else!</li>
    <li> Not only does the flat iron work beautifully, it was packaged beautifully, too!  Lots of nice little extras included.  :-)</li>
    <li> My wife &amp; daughter love this thing. Pricey but lasts forever.</li>
