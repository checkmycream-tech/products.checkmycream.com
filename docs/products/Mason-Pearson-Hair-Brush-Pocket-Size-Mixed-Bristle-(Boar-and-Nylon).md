      <li>I like the pocket size because it stows nicely in my purse.  </li>
      <li>Love this brush.</li>
      <li>The bristles have to be able to reach your scalp, and massage it and distribute the oils throughout your hair.</li>

      <li>So satisfied, bought another.for a frien.</li>

      <li>That&#x27;s how we did it :)</li>
      <li>I knew my 15-year old would steal mine lol.</li>
      <li>It is a beautiful heirloom brush worth every penny of the incredibly high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It brushes easily through my roots to my scalp.</li>
      <li>She considers it the finest quality brush available.</li>
      <li>They are fabulous brushes.  </li>
      <li>The BN3 or BN2 models are the more generally useful brushes around the home.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Well worth every Penney you pay!</li>
      <li>They are pricey, but well worth it!  </li>
      <li>My 24 year old daughter just used one of them for the first time, and immediately asked for her own because it was better than any she had used before -</li>
      <li>the pocket brush is for travel and special uses.</li>
      <li>- I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these brushes.  </li>
      <li>Once you use one of these Mason Pearson Boar Bristle hair brushes, you will never be happy with any other hair brush.  </li>
      <li>i now own 3 different sizes in this brush and have turned my mother-in-law on to them as well!</li>
      <li>This makes the expense of a Mason Pearson brush well worth the money--it&#x27;s a luxury item and the purchase is an investment--</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>

      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>and it glides right through.</li>
      <li>It was a big hit and was exactly the kind of brush she wanted.  </li>
      <li>My husband loves it dearly though, and really enjoys using it himself, or as a special treat, allowing me to brush his hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;*****rly though, and really enjoys using it himself, or as a special treat, allowing me to brush his hair.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair which was starting to show signs of thinning.  </li>
      <li>Now, if you&#x27;re in the market for a new mattress and/or box spring, I have an equally fabulous recommendation for you.  </li>
      <li>If you want to make points with your favorite female, get her one of these!!</li>
      <li>I purchased a pocket and a large brushe around 1982, and have used them every day since.</li>
      <li>This is important not so much because of where the brush will be kept (say, in your handbag), but because of the bristle length of the various sizes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are two things you need to know when you&#x27;re ready to buy a Mason Pearson brush of any sort.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re the type of person who would rather enjoy an evening at home having your hair brushed by your spouse instead of going to dinner and a movie, then you can justify the cost.</li>
      <li>Mason Pearson brushes are the real deal.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re the type of person who would rather enjoy an evening at home having your hair brushed by your spouse instead of going to dinner and a movie, then you can justify the cost.</li>
      <li>Not exceptional but good.</li>
      <li>My wife has used either the full size or this smaller handbag size</li>
      <li>A decent product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend checking the Mason Pearson web site out as they tell you specifically what type of brush you need according to your hair type.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.   </li>
      <li>I have little more than a hint of hair in the brush.  </li>
      <li>come with a cleaning brush, so that you can easily clean loose hairs out of your brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>She is bi-racial (black &amp; white) and has very fine, fly-away spiral curls.</li>
      <li>I finally had to replace my first one&lt;</li>
      <li>I bought my first MP brushes in 1975, a pocket size for my purse and a larger one for home.  </li>
      <li>Just the right size, same high quality as their larger brushes.arrived when promised.</li>
      <li>When I was in my early 50&#x27;s, I found out about these Mason Pearson brushes and bought one.  </li>
      <li>I got this brush for my 4-year old&#x27;s curly hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, this mixed bristle brush is for normal, finer, and shorter hair.</li>
      <li>but my husband uses it; although I have short hair it is very thick and straight and coarse and the brush bristles won&#x27;t reach all the way to my scalp, but slides over the top hairs.</li>
      <li>Had to give one to my granddaughter and now she is hooked and she is only 8 years old.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK, but not great, and definately over-priced.</li>
      <li>I finally replaced my 30-year-old MP purse brush with a new one: only because the handle was so worn.</li>
      <li>She actually sat still while I brushed the tangled mess from her hair, into a smoothly parted double bun coiffure!</li>
      <li>This mixed bristle brush will work well for you if your hair is fine to normal and not too long or too thick.</li>

    <li> MY 4TH POCKET MASON PIERSON BRUSH!. LOVE THEM! Had to give one to my granddaughter and now she is hooked and she is only 8 years old. Ordered it from England and got it in a short time. YOU WILL BE HAPPY YOU DID!</li>
    <li> Love the way it feels when I brush my hair!</li>
    <li> Love this brush. Perfect size for travelling.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my wife.  It was a big hit and was exactly the kind of brush she wanted.  It was a replacement for one which she had purchased many yeas ago.  She considers it the finest quality brush available.</li>
    <li> Very nice hair brush ! You will hate the other brushes after this! You can put it in your bag (it is small).</li>
    <li> *****&lt;br /&gt;This is a review for a pocket or small (about 6 3/4 inches long) Mason Pearson brush made of five rings of mixed boar bristle and nylon. The longer bristles are nylon and the shorter ones are boar bristle. It is a beautiful heirloom brush worth every penny of the incredibly high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the larger Mason Pearson brushes, including this one, come with a cleaning brush, so that you can easily clean loose hairs out of your brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two things you need to know when you&#x27;re ready to buy a Mason Pearson brush of any sort. One is the size: full-size (the largest size), handy (medium sized), or pocket (the smallest size). This is important not so much because of where the brush will be kept (say, in your handbag), but because of the bristle length of the various sizes. The smaller sizes have shorter bristles. The bristles have to be able to reach your scalp, and massage it and distribute the oils throughout your hair. If you want a small brush but you have thick or long hair, you&#x27;d do better with a larger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other consideration is the bristle type. Do you want a mixed bristle brush like this one that is part boar bristle and part nylon? What is most comfortable and performs the best with your hair. This mixed bristle brush will work well for you if your hair is fine to normal and not too long or too thick. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll need to go with the Detangler because the bristles are stiffer and can reach down through all of your hair to the scalp; the Detangler is the only Mason Pearson brush that can reach the scalp of extremely thick hair. Mason Pearson also makes an All Boar Bristle Brush for finer or shorter hair but I have never tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this mixed bristle brush is for normal, finer, and shorter hair. I bought it for myself but my husband uses it; although I have short hair it is very thick and straight and coarse and the brush bristles won&#x27;t reach all the way to my scalp, but slides over the top hairs. My husband loves it dearly though, and really enjoys using it himself, or as a special treat, allowing me to brush his hair. This makes the expense of a Mason Pearson brush well worth the money--it&#x27;s a luxury item and the purchase is an investment--but it&#x27;s worth it. If you&#x27;re the type of person who would rather enjoy an evening at home having your hair brushed by your spouse instead of going to dinner and a movie, then you can justify the cost. That&#x27;s how we did it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For additional information on Mason Pearson visit their web site at masonpearson dot com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*****rly though, and really enjoys using it himself, or as a special treat, allowing me to brush his hair.

    <li> Mason Pearson makes the premier hair brush.  I bought my first MP brushes in 1975, a pocket size for my purse and a larger one for home.  Those brushes didn&#x27;t need to be replaced until now.  They are fabulous brushes.  They are pricey, but well worth it!  You can&#x27;t beat a 36 year run!</li>
    <li> The brush exceeding my expections.  There is nothing like it.  I like the pocket size because it stows nicely in my purse.  Great investment</li>
    <li> I purchased a pocket and a large brushe around 1982, and have used them every day since. Only now are they starting to show their age. My 24 year old daughter just used one of them for the first time, and immediately asked for her own because it was better than any she had used before - and she&#x27;s picky. Hopefully they&#x27;ll still be around when her daughter asks her for her own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am writing this review to celebrate a product that lasts. In the long run, quality products are cheaper.</li>
    <li> Once you use one of these Mason Pearson Boar Bristle hair brushes, you will never be happy with any other hair brush.  I have very fine hair which was starting to show signs of thinning.  When I was in my early 50&#x27;s, I found out about these Mason Pearson brushes and bought one.  It actually helped save my hair.  Now it&#x27;s in the best shape ever - I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these brushes.  Now, if you&#x27;re in the market for a new mattress and/or box spring, I have an equally fabulous recommendation for you.  E-mail me for the details</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift because the person used mine and loved it. I have had mine for 25 plus years and probably will last till I die! I have nylon and bristle...doesn&#x27;t pull or break your hair, mine is long. I also have really thick hair and it glides right through. Well worth every Penney you pay!</li>
    <li> I brush my Maltese everyday. I have little more than a hint of hair in the brush.  It is a great brush!</li>
    <li> Mason Pearson brushes are the real deal. They are vey expensive, but worth it!! The comination of bristles andnyklon are perfect mix. If you want to make points with your favorite female, get her one of these!! She will love you for it!! the pocket brush is for travel and special uses. The BN3 or BN2 models are the more generally useful brushes around the home.</li>
    <li> This brush will change the way your hair feels. Massaging to the scalp and doesn&#x27;t make your hair staticky like other boar bristle brushes. Perfect for those with fine hair and travels nicely.</li>
    <li> One of the best hairbrushes. I finally had to replace my first one&lt;br /&gt;after 50 years.</li>
    <li> A decent product. Not exceptional but good. The hype about this brand being a \\&quot;luxury item\\&quot; escapes me. It&#x27;s OK, but not great, and definately over-priced.</li>
    <li> Everyone should have one.</li>
    <li> I got this brush for my 4-year old&#x27;s curly hair. She is bi-racial (black &amp; white) and has very fine, fly-away spiral curls. It gets matted into an impossible bird&#x27;s nest while she sleeps. She actually sat still while I brushed the tangled mess from her hair, into a smoothly parted double bun coiffure! It was so nice! No hollering, no running away, no tears streaming down her cheeks lol It is so nice that I got the Popular for myself (I am 4 months post-relaxer with bra-strap length hair) and it feels soooo good on my scalp. It brushes easily through my roots to my scalp. I also got the detangling brush, detangling comb, rake comb, and 2 dressing combs (aka Grandmama comb) bc I knew my 15-year old would steal mine lol. Get the Mason Pearsons, you will NOT regret it!!</li>
    <li> Amazing why I have not bought this brush years ago.. My hair would have been a lot healthier!  This brush truly stimulates my scalp ! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Just the right size, same high quality as their larger brushes.arrived when promised. So satisfied, bought another.for a frien. Fully recommend</li>
    <li> My wife has used either the full size or this smaller handbag size Mason Pearson hair brush for over thirty years. Would not use any other. Loves how it brushed, how it looks, how it feels.</li>
    <li> i now own 3 different sizes in this brush and have turned my mother-in-law on to them as well! they nurture your hair.</li>
    <li> Mason Pearson Brushes are the best!  Highly recommend checking the Mason Pearson web site out as they tell you specifically what type of brush you need according to your hair type.</li>
    <li> The best quality available in a hairbrush. I finally replaced my 30-year-old MP purse brush with a new one: only because the handle was so worn. Expensive, but an investment.</li>
