      <li>For a cheap price, it&#x27;s an okay palette.</li>
      <li>, I feel it is about 96% as good as the real one.</li>
      <li>I was hoping to just get a good set of colors from this, not expecting the real thing at all -</li>
      <li>Beautiful colors, much better than expected.</li>
      <li>When it arrived I was very impressed, the box it came in, the palette itself and even the brush are exactly like urban decays.</li>
      <li>and the colors are so very pretty!</li>
      <li>The shipping was kind of fast.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cheap alternative.</li>

      <li>Fantastic colors</li>
      <li>Is not the real thing!!!</li>

      <li>You are better off spending the money on the real thing!</li>

      <li>this is seriously the best bargain out there.</li>
      <li>For the price and look, it&#x27;s a great second option to the real thing.</li>
      <li>Definitely going to buy more!</li>
      <li>One of the eyeshadow colors was half-empty, the brush that came with the set was wrapped in its own packaging and that same color was all over one end of the brush!!!!  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth buying.</li>
      <li>The brush is really good quality although the shadows are not very pigmented.</li>
      <li>( also I wanted to see if it was nice enough to use as a birthday gift).</li>
      <li>Very pigmented and the brush is pretty good quality recommended for makeup girls the only thing that I don&#x27;t like is the mirror</li>
      <li>The colors don&#x27;t go on as rich as I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s a decent dupe.</li>
      <li>lol, the colors are labeled the same as the real naked 2, although they aren&#x27;t as pigmented.</li>
      <li>I absoleutly love this and the colors are practically identical to the naked palette.</li>

      <li>and it was the actual thing! :)</li>

      <li>Their okay not as pigmented didn&#x27;t like the naked 2</li>
      <li>The shipping was really fast too!</li>
      <li>and I got it much faster than I thought I would!</li>

      <li>The pigments are slightly less pigmented, but honestly I don&#x27;t think anyone would notice.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It has not the same quality the one I have previously bought before originally from the real sales from Naked.&lt;br /&gt;This is not the real one.&lt;br /&gt;Not the same quality than the originals palette.</li>
    <li> Colors are beautiful . It&#x27;s a great buy! I love it . I bought some as gifts and they loved it as well.</li>
    <li> I wanted the naked 2 palette for the longest time and I was so excited when I opened it and it was the actual thing! :)</li>
    <li> I got this today and im surpise surprise!!! Really this is real deal great shadow colors,nice pigmented and owesome price! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Good quality but definitely you know that it is fake but for the price this is still ok my niece loves it</li>
    <li> Their okay not as pigmented didn&#x27;t like the naked 2 i ordered the warm Colors that&#x27;s for being cheap .</li>
    <li> I got this instead of the naked palette to see if it really was the same quality and it was! I absoleutly love this and the colors are practically identical to the naked palette. Save your money and buy this instead.</li>
    <li> The packaging on this item actually says it is the Naked2. The colors are very similar except for a few. I actually got an eye infection after using this palette.... Never again will I buy a dupe! save your money and buy the original version. Aside from that the seller shipped early!</li>
    <li> I knew this wouldn&#x27;t be the real Naked 2 but when I got it, it had the logo on the front and the eye shawdows look stunning! Definitely worth buying. I give it 4/5 stars because the iron box was a little dented and you can&#x27;t see out the mirror other than that I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom on christmas day and it arrived around january 6th. this is the fastest thing that I recived from Asia. My mom freaked over it, although I dont think she knows its a fake, but I won&#x27;t crush her happiness. The packaging is wonderful! It comes with a paper box the says naked 2 and inside is the tin box that also says naked 2. The brush is really good quality although the shadows are not very pigmented. Comes with all the colors on naked 2, I thought it was the real thing but the lettering is in green not brown.</li>
    <li> If it&#x27;s a knockoff, it&#x27;s the most convincing knockoff I&#x27;ve ever seen. The quality of the colors is phenomenal. Love!</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;Naked 2\\&quot; Arrived today. It arrived much faster than anticipated. I like the colors and the case. The problem is the mirror. It is cheap and looks like it is loose in one of the corners. It is also blurry and not usable at all. I&#x27;m not too upset about it because it was so inexpensive. $12.00 isn&#x27;t bad for what you get, so it is a decent dupe at this point. I haven&#x27;t tried the colors yet, so I may be changing my rating if needed.</li>
    <li> So today i received my naked 2 urban decay eye shadow pallet, it shipped much quicker than i thought! Immediately the box threw me off because it looks just like the real urban decay! i was expecting a cheap knockoff box that was blank. I opened the box and even the pallet itself says naked 2! I seriously would not be able to tell the difference just by looking at it. The pallet came with some scratches and nicks but it didn&#x27;t bother me to much because i was more concerned about the colors. As i opened the pallet it has a clear plastic cover over the mirror (a lot of people in the previous reviews have said the mirror is horrible) once you take off the plastic its perfect! the colors are nice and so is the brush! I am really glad i have purchased this item and can&#x27;t wait to use it! I highly recommend this product to everyone because you get a lot for your money! Yeah the colors might not be as pigmented as the real thing but they are still very beautiful!</li>
    <li> Many people have commented that it&#x27;s the real thing and that it&#x27;s good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think so. The eyeshadows are not smooth and they do not last very long when applied. I was hoping to just get a good set of colors from this, not expecting the real thing at all - but this is terrible makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for high-quality makeup - DO NOT BUY THIS. Buy the real Naked2 Palette.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re 15 and looking to convince your friends you have the coolest make up, sure, get this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This palette may have the exact same writing and fonts as the real thing, but it comes in a paper box that says Naked2 on the top, with all the colors and the ingredients on the back. The real Naked2 palette comes in a clear, thin plastic box accompanied by a lip gloss.</li>
    <li> i have been using Urban Decay for years and have always wanted the Naked palette but did not want to spend that much money. I can not believe this was $15 and the colors are gorgeous and show up great on my skin. They also last a long time too especially if you use an eye shadow primer. Very happy with this!</li>
    <li> I ordered this knowing it was a knock off (dupe)....To my surprise it was the real UD2 palette upon arrival.  The shadows are beautiful and very pigmented.</li>
    <li> Obviously this is a knock off of the real UD Naked3 pallete. This eyeshadow comes from god knows where with god knows what in it and people are going to put it on their eyes??? I don&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really say anything about how the actual make up is cause it is a gift for my roommate and she hasn&#x27;t gotten it yet, but the service I received was great! they shipped it in time and I got it much faster than I thought I would!</li>
    <li> I got it in the mail this morning and I opened it, not expecting much, but it&#x27;s the real naked 2 pallete!! I swear to God I&#x27;m so happy i almost cried. this is seriously the best bargain out there. Buy it!!!</li>
    <li> I have always wanted the Naked 2 palette, but thought it was unreasonable to pay over $40 for it. However, I can&#x27;t complain about this purchase, much cheaper than Urban Decay.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not even kidding, I compared it to my friends real palette and you can&#x27;t even tell the difference. Best deal ever!</li>
    <li> When I received the palette the sides where stuck together? and when I opened it all of the shadows were broken and some were not even glued into the palette?! there was shadow every where I was not happy at all with the product the packaging is very similar to the actual naked 2 but over all I was not impressed and I definitely would not purchase another item from them.</li>
    <li> I gOt this ,I thought it was a knock off urban decay,but it was the real one!so I&#x27;m so excited and have been using every day,and the price us great.thank you</li>
    <li> I have been yearning for an Urban Decay Naked pallette but at $58 each it was way out of my budget. My coworker bought this one and it was absolutely the real deal down to the high quality real hair brushes. I decided to order one and I am completely impressed. This IS the real Urban Decay Naked 2, there is no doubt. I am a huge makeup aficionado and have other UD products. This is authentic for a fraction of the cost. I really am not surprised, the item is made in China to begin with so it makes perfect sense to purchase one directly from China. I am anxiously waiting for enough time to elapse to make Naked 3 available.</li>
    <li> Just received mine yesterday! And honestly I can&#x27;t tell whether it is fake or real! But it&#x27;s aaahhhmazing! The colors are perfect, the packaging, that brush it&#x27;s just all so perfect!! I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND. I mean this compared to $52 ohh yeahhh!!</li>
    <li> I am on the fence about this. The shipping was kind of fast. I can&#x27;t tell if this is the actual Naked Palette or not because it says Naked 2 on the cover when you receive it. I feel like the colors don&#x27;t show up too well and could have more pigment. But most of the colors I like. For a cheap price, it&#x27;s an okay palette.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, much better than expected. Colors glide on and stay on. Blendable.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day. I am impressed.</li>
    <li> I Never Recived Mine!! I bought mine in January it is now the end of Feb., wish I could have tried it out!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cheap alternative. The colors don&#x27;t go on as rich as I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s a decent dupe. I like it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s basically naked 2 make up and it&#x27;s amazing, the mirror was pretty bad but I wouldn&#x27;t make it such a problem</li>
    <li> This is an amazing pallete! I definitely love it, ever since I got it I use it everyday day. The shipping was really fast too! I definitely recommend this pallete!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this naked 2, I know its a knock-off but for $15 its wonderful, A great buy for a product that coast normally $60-70</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real deal! Fantastic colors and you can&#x27;t beat the price! So happy with my purchase. Now to learn how to properly apply it!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eye shadow!!! I would recommend to everyone! Definitely going to buy more! Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> It was an excellent eyeshadow pallet.. I&#x27;m ordering more for my mom and sister overall I would recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> OMG LOVE THIS ESPECIALLY THE PRICE!!!LOVE EACH AND EVERY COLOR IN IT!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!! GREAT PRICE AND ITS A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> This is very similar to urban decay naked 2. It has the same packaging, but is lower quality. The colors are all very close, half baked is more copper than gold in this one. Over all happy with purchase, I like the colors and getting 12 of any eyeshadow for this price is good. It is definitely a knock off though, like a fake coach, it has all the markings but is not the same.</li>
    <li> Bought this thinking it was a knockoff of the urban decay naked 2 palette......opened it and it&#x27;s the real thing! Extremely happy!</li>
    <li> quality of the shadows is good, nice choices of colors. It arrived fairly prompt, one of the shadows was a bit broken but not a lot was lost.  Good price.</li>
    <li> I finally received this product after about a month and it is all completely in pieces I have to return it now because it is not usable.</li>
    <li> Arrived in 10 days, the eyeshadow looked great. It eve said Urban Decay Naked 2 on the box! Definitely going t recommend to other people interested in the naked eyeshadows.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product online because it was cheaper than buying it in the store.  since I have bought it I have had no problems with the makeup, it is very pigmented and it works well just like any high priced makeup.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this! Knew it would be a knock off per the description, but i wasn&#x27;t expecting such a great dupe. If you didn&#x27;t know, you would think it was real. It has Urban Decay and Naked 2 written on the outside of the tin pallet, as well as on the brush. The mirror is great, be sure to take off the plastic for those saying you don&#x27;t like it lol, the colors are labeled the same as the real naked 2, although they aren&#x27;t as pigmented. For the price and look, it&#x27;s a great second option to the real thing. Arrived in nine days!!!</li>
    <li> The box and package say urban decay naked 2 and the colors are amazing...Love these shadows...The brush looks fancy pants too.  Save yo dollaras!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The tittle says it all really. I was beyond excited to get this, which it does takes awhile coming from out of the country. When it arrived I was very impressed, the box it came in, the palette itself and even the brush are exactly like urban decays. What suckers I thought to pay full price!! That is until I tried to use this palette. The shadows are not pigmented, chalky and don&#x27;t blend well, even with a great primer. I ended up just giving this to a friend because I couldn&#x27;t use it. You get what you pay for like they say... If your looking for something just for show on ur vanity or to add to your collection for looks it&#x27;s a winner because it looks exactly the same now that I have the real one.... But not great for use.</li>
    <li> Worst transaction ever!!!after a month and a half never got my item.they said they would put money back on my account but I told them that I switched banks and no longer had that card,and that I just wanted my item...they basically told me I was out of luck then had the nerve to ask me to leave positive feedback!!!!!!SCAM ALERT!!!!!!Don&#x27;t do business with these &amp;#34;sellers&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The picture of the &amp;#34;supposed &amp;#34; to be product is just pictures of the Actual Naked 2 Palette. I Know because on the first picture they show the brush says Naked 2 on it. but, I Will Be Soon Buying This To See If It IS Just Like The Naked 2 Palette. I Just Wanted To let People Know That.</li>
    <li> Very pigmented and the brush is pretty good quality recommended for makeup girls the only thing that I don&#x27;t like is the mirror but that doesn&#x27;t matter to me</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so beautiful if it is the fake one you can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s so identical I&#x27;m happy with this purchase yay !!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have both Naked 1&amp;2(the real deal),and bought the dupe of naked 1 for my sister and she loved it,so I wanted to see what the dupe of Naked 2 was like,so I got it for her and the colors are so very pretty! Very creamy and highly pigmented. There is definite differences in some of the colors in comparison to the authentic 1, but some of the colors are even prettier and sparklier in this palette. Im shocked and highly impressed with this $12 palette. I wish I would&#x27;ve known this and saved the $40 difference myself!! It didn&#x27;t even take that long to get to me,being that it comes from Hong Kong. I will recommend this to any makeup lover</li>
    <li> Not exactly the same colors in the picture but you get what you paid for and it came early for me</li>
    <li> I ordered this eyeshadow thinking I&#x27;m getting a knockoff, but was shocked to find out it&#x27;s the authentic Urban Decay 2! I was beyond excited when I opened it up. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
    <li> This is amazing, do yourself a favor and just buy it! I have the real one and wanted this a travel back up ( also I wanted to see if it was nice enough to use as a birthday gift). It is wonderful, I feel it is about 96% as good as the real one. The pigments are slightly less pigmented, but honestly I don&#x27;t think anyone would notice. Nothing was broken, it has all the UD branding.. it looks great, travels well and is an amazing value.</li>
    <li> Is not the real thing!!! You are better off spending the money on the real thing! Paint doesn&#x27;t stay on!</li>
    <li> At first I was pleasantly impressed by this product, but as each time I used it I found my skin reacted not so great to it. I&#x27;m not usually sensitive to any product. I&#x27;m no longer using it after a couple of tries.</li>
    <li> I love this product! The shadows are very soft and last all day.. no need to keep reapplying and it feels so natural</li>
    <li> When I received this makeup it was USED!!  One of the eyeshadow colors was half-empty, the brush that came with the set was wrapped in its own packaging and that same color was all over one end of the brush!!!!  Eyeshadow &amp;#34;crumbs&amp;#34; were everywhere, I had such a mess on my hands and my countertop.  Lessoned learned - you get what you pay for.</li>
