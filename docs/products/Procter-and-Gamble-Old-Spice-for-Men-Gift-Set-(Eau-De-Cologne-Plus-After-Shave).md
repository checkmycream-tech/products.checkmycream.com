      <li>Good product, nice gift for dad, he miss the product.  </li>
      <li>The smell was good not quite as rich as I remember.</li>
      <li>Great product and exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I will keep looking around at Walmart for a better deal.</li>
      <li>I can purchase them separately cheaper in the store and get more for my money.</li>
      <li>what more could i ask for?</li>
      <li>A Truly Excellent Product - I highly recommend - Fast delivery service....</li>
      <li>The original blend (around 1902) was to be for women, but was reformulated and became legendary, apparently beating out Bay Rum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old brand label suggested adding water to the after shave if it was too stingy for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I got it because its an old classic, when I used it I found out why, I like it, its a nice scent.</li>
      <li>The older man that item was purchased for has had a hard time finding this classic and was very happy when gift was opened.</li>
      <li>Exactly as Described.</li>
      <li>would  order again next Christmas for more people on my list.</li>
      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>Really disheartening.</li>
      <li>Really, this an absolute letdown.</li>
      <li>Great product just less volume than expected for that price!</li>
      <li>and I hope the classic scent never changes or is discontinued.</li>
      <li>Appreciated by a long time user of the original old spice</li>
      <li>patchouli kind of went out in the late 1960&#x27;s [sigh].</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought my father Old Spice for Christmas every year since I was a child.</li>
      <li>HE LOVES HIS OLD SPICE..</li>
      <li>This was also a gift for my dad he loves old spice he looks forward to me getting him for him  </li>
      <li>This is NOT the Old Spice I grew up with or the Old Spice my father used to use.</li>
      <li>I once did some research on Old Spice for a radio bit years ago.</li>
      <li>My father loves all things Old Spice-related.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t beat OLD SPICE for your men.</li>

    <li> for the price that I paid for this product, I was extremely disappointed with the size of the bottles. I can purchase them separately cheaper in the store and get more for my money. It was supposed to be a gift set for Christmas which is why I bought the set on line.</li>

    <li> Great Vendor! Exactly as Described. I will use again!</li>
    <li> I once did some research on Old Spice for a radio bit years ago. The original blend (around 1902) was to be for women, but was reformulated and became legendary, apparently beating out Bay Rum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old brand label suggested adding water to the after shave if it was too stingy for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m asking for some from my wife for Christmas, as I have all the tech toys I can handle and Aramis is expensive and somewhat more intrusive...patchouli kind of went out in the late 1960&#x27;s [sigh].</li>
    <li> Buyer beware! This is NOT the Old Spice I grew up with or the Old Spice my father used to use. Plastic decanters! Really, this an absolute letdown. Really disheartening.</li>
    <li> Great gift.  Appreciated by a long time user of the original old spice would  order again next Christmas for more people on my list.</li>
    <li> This was also a gift for my dad he loves old spice he looks forward to me getting him for him  Christmas I think that he would be disappointed if I didn&#x27;t get him some</li>
