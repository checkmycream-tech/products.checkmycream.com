<ol>
      <li>The brush does an excellent job in applying even coverage.</li>
      <li>excellent product-glides to perfection-luminous-excellent service-</li>
      <li>Dispenses just the rig amount of makeup with one &amp;#34;click.&amp;#34; Wonderful product.</li>
      <li>I knew it was my incredible visible lift foundation makeup.</li>
      <li>Even great around the eye.</li>
      <li>Great coverage--hides blemishes.</li>
      <li>everything was great from the time i ordered it until the time i received</li>
      <li>Stays out, color match is great, makeup lasts all day with powder finish.</li>
      <li>Great coverage.</li>
      <li>They combined a great liquid foundation with the foundation brush to apply it.</li>
      <li>but nothing beats L&#x27;Oreal in my book and this one is the best of the best if you need coverage without looking cakey or pasty...just dewy natural-looking beautiful skin, and the brush makes application quick and easy...swipe it on, blend and you&#x27;re done.  </li>
      <li>This makeup is great - good coverage</li>
      <li>You too will notice this in a bright store in the mall...  </li>
      <li>But, the coverage is good.</li>
      <li>I bought all that was listed as available!!  </li>
      <li>I plan on buying more!</li>
      <li>I will be getting more!</li>
      <li>This product is amazing</li>
      <li>It is amazing and it lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve bought some really nice brushes just in case.  </li>
      <li>The brush makes application so smooth and easy!!</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure they would swear nothing has been changed.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find it in stores any more.</li>
      <li>This is a lovely foundation makeup.</li>
      <li>I love the applicator</li>
      <li>Love this foundation.  </li>
      <li>Love the brush to apply.</li>
      <li>I went to pick up more and can not find anywhere with the brush.  </li>
      <li>I love the product but the container needs redesign.  </li>
      <li>Over 40 and this stuff is magic.</li>
      <li>I love this makeup and the applicator brush bottle.  </li>
      <li>I love L&#x27;Oreal products, but</li>
      <li>I love this makeup.</li>
      <li>This product is better than I could have ever imagined.  </li>
      <li>....stays in place for hours! :-)</li>
      <li>You can apply more if you wish</li>
      <li>And then find that it actually works perfectly once you spend a week vacationing pool side in Phoenix.  </li>
      <li>It covers beautifully without streaking and looks very natural.</li>
      <li>If you want excellent coverage in a clean and simple applicator (there will never be make up beneath your nails when you are using an attached fine bristled brush) specifically in a natural skin tone, this is perfect.</li>
      <li>Easy to use--though you will need to rub in with your fingers afterwards.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use the brush much but, it comes in handy for when I need to smooth places!</li>
      <li>Goes on so smooth, color of skin easy to match to foundation.</li>
      <li>with this my skin looks fine.</li>
      <li>Try this before they decide no one likes it and discontinue it as cosmetics manufacturers are so quick to do!</li>
      <li>but luckily I found it on Amazon!</li>
      <li>is smooth and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>The brush allows you to smooth foundation out</li>
      <li>Very smooth, hides the flaws in my skin really well and makes me look healthy and natural, it blends really nicely.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy, quick</li>
      <li>That being said, I am aware, having used this product many times before, that &amp;#34;classic ivory&amp;#34; does not begin to describe this hue.  </li>
      <li>Classic Ivory is great for me, I live in FL and need the sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I just clean the brush with an alcohol wipe once a week to keep brush clean.</li>
      <li>I bought this item at a local store on clearance and loved it.</li>
      <li>I was nervous about the brush being built in, but I love it, it&#x27;s so much easier to apply than with a sponge or my fingers.</li>
      <li>My favorite aspect is the direct application.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 67 years old and my skin rivaled many 40 year olds.</li>
      <li>The foundation dried pretty quickly and looked great.</li>
      <li>but it takes practice to get the right amount on the brush.</li>
      <li>it has the coverage that I need,its the right color for me</li>
      <li>To my surprize the dry brush does a better job than a sponge!</li>
      <li>This was much darker than expected (I have fair skin) and looks orange-ish on my face.</li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product since I first found it.  </li>
      <li>I really like this,brush and all!</li>
      <li>I really like this foundation!  </li>
      <li>Classic Ivory is way to dark for my fair complexion and i found the makeups finish too mat.</li>
      <li>so you will not apply too much.</li>
      <li>Really like this makeup</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;ve gotten used to this brush applicator and really like it.</li>
      <li>It also leaves the face looking rather greasy and doesn&#x27;t do much for covering redness.</li>
      <li>Much to my chagrin, the click/turn device has stopped working</li>
      <li>Built in brush is very helpful.</li>
      <li>I really like this product,  </li>
      <li>The delivery was fast, the price was fantastic, the product in tact and exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>Finally they did it right!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to those who wear makeup, regardless of your age.  </li>
      <li>and then just use my fingers a little bit to smooth it in.</li>
      <li>I turn the dial about 5 times and then on the next turn, a whole blob of foundation comes out at once.</li>
      <li>I have no trouble with the brush , I just click one at a time and press to my face until a bit of product comes out.</li>
      <li>It reflects a lot of light but isn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
      <li>I have tried some of the expensive dept. store makeups like Clinique and Estee Lauder, Prescriptives (loved Prescriptives foundation but was allergic to something in it)...</li>
      <li>Even after lots of blotting, the brush was pretty wet</li>
      <li>Finally, a makeup that looks  and feels natural !</li>
      <li>LIKE NO OTHER</li>
      <li>and I love the brush - no more getting my hands messy with foundation and finish</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little thicker &amp; it covers really well.</li>

<li> Too dark for me and the twister stopped working not even halfway through the tube, so the vast majority of the product is inaccessible.</li>
<li> I had previously written that wish it just came in a regular bottle like it used to.</li>
<li> only is it a bit of a trick to find it with the Brush top - not in the stores anymore, but its the same horrible product that is in the pump bottle with the same name!.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not as even at dispensing as the other bottles.</li>
<li> If you TRULY wear ivory in other brands ...</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes like other sunscreen loaded foundations do.  </li>

    <li> excellent product-glides to perfection-luminous-excellent service-</li>
    <li> Vendor delivered product as promised. I bought this item at a local store on clearance and loved it. I went back and the rest were gone but luckily I found it on Amazon! This makeup is great - good coverage and I love the brush - no more getting my hands messy with foundation and finish is smooth and lasts all day. I plan on buying more!</li>
    <li> I have been using makeup for close to 50 years.  This product is better than I could have ever imagined.  It&#x27;s different....no sponges, a dry brush instead.  When I first used it I had to learn to twist up a VERY SMALL AMOUNT into the brush by twisting the container. To my surprize the dry brush does a better job than a sponge! It is amazing and it lasts all day.  It&#x27;s easy, quick and I can&#x27;t imagine going back to any other makeup.  The lift is just enough to make me look and feel younger.  I highly recommend this to those who wear makeup, regardless of your age.  (I am 64)  F. Parker</li>
    <li> I was nervous about the brush being built in, but I love it, it&#x27;s so much easier to apply than with a sponge or my fingers. Very smooth, hides the flaws in my skin really well and makes me look healthy and natural, it blends really nicely.</li>
    <li> This was much darker than expected (I have fair skin) and looks orange-ish on my face. It also leaves the face looking rather greasy and doesn&#x27;t do much for covering redness.</li>
    <li> I really like this product,  it has the coverage that I need,its the right color for me and I like how it works(comes up through the brush).</li>
    <li> Too dark for me and the twister stopped working not even halfway through the tube, so the vast majority of the product is inaccessible.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup and the applicator brush bottle.  I can&#x27;t find it in stores any more. I wonder if they have discontinued it?</li>
    <li> This is a lovely foundation makeup. It covers beautifully without streaking and looks very natural. The brush applicator at the tip of the bottle is awful, however. The product is loaded on to the brush by twisting the bottle. It is impossible to see how much foundation is coming up into the brush and so there is a lot of wasted product because you can&#x27;t properly gauge how much you are going to get when you twist. The brush ended up dripping with foundation and had to be blotted. Even after lots of blotting, the brush was pretty wet and I felt like I was applying spackle to my face. I used a natural sea sponge (wet and wrung dry) to distribute the foundation evenly on my face.  The foundation dried pretty quickly and looked great.</li>
    <li> The delivery was fast, the price was fantastic, the product in tact and exactly what I expected. That being said, I am aware, having used this product many times before, that &amp;#34;classic ivory&amp;#34; does not begin to describe this hue.  If you want excellent coverage in a clean and simple applicator (there will never be make up beneath your nails when you are using an attached fine bristled brush) specifically in a natural skin tone, this is perfect. If you TRULY wear ivory in other brands ... Do not buy this.  If you believe that you are pale... do not order this! You will have an orange face and a white neck.  You too will notice this in a bright store in the mall...  (Ouch!) And then find that it actually works perfectly once you spend a week vacationing pool side in Phoenix.  Seriously! Seeing as how the winter is approaching... Your tanning opportunities may be fading!</li>
    <li> Stays out, color match is great, makeup lasts all day with powder finish. Built in brush is very helpful. Dispenses just the rig amount of makeup with one &amp;#34;click.&amp;#34; Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Recommend it. Covers blemishes, red spots and dark spots well - even under eye.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup. Just wish you could still find it in the stores</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since I first found it.  I&#x27;d been looking for it and decided to try Amazon.  There it was - so - I bought all that was listed as available!!  The brush makes application so smooth and easy!!</li>
    <li> I really like this,brush and all! I don&#x27;t use the brush much but, it comes in handy for when I need to smooth places!</li>
    <li> Have been using for 2 years, and 2 bottles have lasted me two years!  I went to pick up more and can not find anywhere with the brush.  Where did it go?  I came on Amazon and ordered.  I hope they bring it back, I&#x27;ve bought some really nice brushes just in case.  I have had no problems with the applicators on my bottles.  Classic Ivory is great for me, I live in FL and need the sunscreen.  It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes like other sunscreen loaded foundations do.  That&#x27;s a big plus for me.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle that I have purchased of this product. It goes on smoothly and does not look fake or chalky. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this foundation!  It&#x27;s a little thicker &amp; it covers really well. The brush does an excellent job in applying even coverage. I will be getting more!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why everyone is complaining about the brush.  This product is amazing and I have not experienced any brush issues.  Not gunky, or dirty or dry.  Love this foundation.  It makes my skin dewy and once you hit 50....that is a must have.  For the price-the store seems less expensive than online, especially if you find a sale.</li>
    <li> What have they done to this product?!!!&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it a bit of a trick to find it with the Brush top - not in the stores anymore, but its the same horrible product that is in the pump bottle with the same name!. I would venture contacting the mfg but I&#x27;m sure they would swear nothing has been changed. At least I&#x27;ve had that reply in similar circumstances. I&#x27;m 67 years old and my skin rivaled many 40 year olds. Not now! I knew it was my incredible visible lift foundation makeup. Now I look my age. I guess it could be worse.</li>
    <li> Over 40 and this stuff is magic. I love the applicator but it takes practice to get the right amount on the brush. It reflects a lot of light but isn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
    <li> i miss finding on the store shelves did they stop making, I would like this product back on the shelves</li>
    <li> I like it very much. with this my skin looks fine.</li>
    <li> Finally they did it right! They combined a great liquid foundation with the foundation brush to apply it. GENIOUS! I tap it on all over my face and then just use my fingers a little bit to smooth it in. Great coverage. Even great around the eye. I have reordered it a few times and my last one has a little trouble dispensing. It&#x27;s not as even at dispensing as the other bottles. I turn the dial about 5 times and then on the next turn, a whole blob of foundation comes out at once. I think it might just be a fluke defect for that one bottle.</li>
    <li> everything was great from the time i ordered it until the time i received</li>
    <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal products, but this totally not what I expected and the coverage wasn&#x27;t as touted.  Live and learn and into the useless foundation pile it goes.</li>
    <li> I have tried some of the expensive dept. store makeups like Clinique and Estee Lauder, Prescriptives (loved Prescriptives foundation but was allergic to something in it)...but nothing beats L&#x27;Oreal in my book and this one is the best of the best if you need coverage without looking cakey or pasty...just dewy natural-looking beautiful skin, and the brush makes application quick and easy...swipe it on, blend and you&#x27;re done.  Try this before they decide no one likes it and discontinue it as cosmetics manufacturers are so quick to do!</li>
    <li> Great coverage--hides blemishes. Easy to use--though you will need to rub in with your fingers afterwards.  will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> THIS I WOULD RECAMEND , IT COVERS  LIKE NO OTHER I HAVE EVER USED , LOOKS SO NATURAL,AND BLENDS LIKE U HAVE NOTHING ON ,</li>
    <li> Finally, a makeup that looks  and feels natural ! It covers small wrinkles and large pores without caking . I have no trouble with the brush , I just click one at a time and press to my face until a bit of product comes out.</li>
    <li> Really like this makeup....stays in place for hours! :-)</li>
    <li> My favorite aspect is the direct application. No more tipping the bottle over and dabbing onto my finger. You do need to blend with this stuff, no magic brush system. But, the coverage is good.</li>
    <li> I love the product but the container needs redesign.  Much to my chagrin, the click/turn device has stopped working&lt;br /&gt;while 1/3 of the makeup is still in the bottle.</li>
    <li> Classic Ivory is way to dark for my fair complexion and i found the makeups finish too mat.</li>
    <li> Goes on so smooth, color of skin easy to match to foundation. Love the brush to apply. I just clean the brush with an alcohol wipe once a week to keep brush clean. The brush allows you to smooth foundation out so you will not apply too much. You can apply more if you wish but I have  never needed too. I don&#x27;t think I have ever seen the lift on my skin so I cannot comment about that.</li>
    <li> I had previously written that wish it just came in a regular bottle like it used to. I like the product and use it as a concealer.  Now I&#x27;ve gotten used to this brush applicator and really like it.</li>
