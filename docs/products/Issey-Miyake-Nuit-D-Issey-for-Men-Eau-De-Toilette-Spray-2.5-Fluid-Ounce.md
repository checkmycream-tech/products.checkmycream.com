      <li>got mine in the mail about 5 days after ordering and it looks good.</li>
      <li>The ladies love it!</li>
      <li>and it was nice to get a savings over the department store price.</li>
      <li>This is by far an awesome cologne.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesnt react better on warmer days</li>
      <li>The ladies just love it.</li>
      <li>and this one moved up to the top three</li>
      <li>this is one of my favorite colognes.  </li>
      <li>awesome product... lasts all day long</li>
      <li>Smells great anytime, and last longer than most Miyake scents.</li>
      <li>Unique ---everyone loves the fragrance.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve received a number of compliments from people because it is unique.</li>
      <li>i dont really understand top notes, etc in cologne.  </li>
      <li>Mildly spicy/musky buy clean and not overpowering.</li>
