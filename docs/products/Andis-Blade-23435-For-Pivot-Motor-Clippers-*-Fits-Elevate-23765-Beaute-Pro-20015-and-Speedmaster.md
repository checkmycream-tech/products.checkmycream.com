      <li>Fits easily and was cutting right away.</li>

    <li> I really enjoy using my andis speedmaster clippers, but my blades were dull and would not cut properly. I found the Andis  Speedmaster  Replacement Blade Set on -line and ordered them. They work perfectly. Very sharp and do a fine job. I recommend them and Amazon if you need some new blades. Amazon, keep doing a great job providing your clientele with necessary items in  a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Thought about getting &amp;#34;new clipper&amp;#34;  Just replace the blades...Glad I did! Better than NEW, cuz I&#x27;m comfortable w/ current machine &amp; cuts good as new! 2 philip screws &amp; easy does it &amp; POW we&#x27;re trimming again! Everything we buy online should work THIS good! under $12 bucks...Get 1...or 2...</li>

    <li> Blade recommended by Andis customer service as a fit for my PM-3 model but couldn&#x27;t get blade to attach and tighten down w/o being crooked. Trimmer works but screw holes seem to be off enough that blade doesn&#x27;t attach perfectly.</li>

    <li> I bought this blade from CBS Express here at amazon.com. It&#x27;s supposed to be &amp;#34;BRAND NEW&amp;#34;. But I opened it, installed, expecting it to be sharp. VERY DULL. I&#x27;m trying to return this item to CBS Express, and the person said &amp;#34;That can&#x27;t be, the blade is new! Unfortunately, it is very dull, so how am I supposed to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to walmart and bought a brand new shaving unit instead! Cost me $10+ tax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller where to return it, no response where to ship it back!</li>
    <li> Blade did not cut my dog&#x27;s hair,I ordered the same blade directly from Andis,paid a little more and it works fine.Also the seller refused to take it back.Keep away from that seller.</li>
    <li> Works great. The shipping was slow.</li>
