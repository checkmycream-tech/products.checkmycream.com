      <li>Not too strong and don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
      <li>Was excited to try this, but way too strong for my taste.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
      <li>and I liked it so much I had to ask this stranger what it was</li>
      <li>then the cap should fit on and be the stopper.</li>
      <li>but my perfume smells like nothing, nada, like lightly flagrance water maybe.</li>
      <li>I would say, after getting my first perfume order from Amazon, i am not doing that any more.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> bottle sure is small for amount of money paid!! More like a sample</li>
    <li> I gave the stars for the scent. I&#x27;m a bit bummed I spent the money on such a small amount. Should of splurged and got a decent sized bottle. Not a fan of the bottle top. Just moving it to the other room after trying it it must of leaked and was all over my fingers and every thing I ate after tasted like it. But whatever. I got what I paid for</li>
    <li> I tried this out in a store and wouldn&#x27;t buy it because I wanted to test it further; so I purchased a mini.  Now I&#x27;m not so sure I like it as well as I thought I did.  I&#x27;m glad I bought a mini.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and such a cute, special bottle .. Would be nice if it had a spray top but still happy with my purchase .. Plus had super prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> I got 2 of the jimmy choo perfumes for mom for mothers day and she really liked them both</li>
    <li> Smell wasn&#x27;t what I expected. .for older women</li>
    <li> This is the smallest &amp;#34;bottle&amp;#34; ever!!  It is not a spray, it is a dabbing sample that you would get at a store in a small make-up gift bag.  :(</li>
    <li> Cap would not stay on the bottle</li>
    <li> IT WAS TOO SMALL.  I WISHED IT WAS A SPRAY BOTTLE..IT SMELLED REALLY NICE</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful! It is a small bottle but will last me a long time &amp; is a great value for the money. I would give it a 5 star but I am not wild about the top on the bottle.</li>
    <li> Love this scent! Long lasting.  Used to wear Burberry Classic but they have changed their formula.  Looking for something new.</li>
    <li> This is a very small bottle as stated.  But wow is it beautiful. It doesn&#x27;t take much to produce a really pleasant smell. It almost reminds me of cashmere mist with a little fruitiness. It is about the size of a prune, but you don&#x27;t need much.  Will definitely order again.  Would make a great gift for any women who has impacted your life. You cant go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> I would say, after getting my first perfume order from Amazon, i am not doing that any more.  I found out I am paying a 2 oz price for a sample and that makes you ...really mad!</li>
    <li> The site said the mini and splash, showed the products together and I only received one.  I would not have purchased just one for the price.</li>
    <li> This purfume is very nice but too small... however I will cherish it...</li>
    <li> The large bottle is now on my Christmas list! This fragrance is so sexy and elegant! I love it, nice size mini bottle also. The seller ships fast!</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy a smaller bottle to first try out this fragrance. It is an always evolving scent. The dry down is what is amazing. The top notes are just okay, it is definitely the dry down that makes this perfume beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;There is something defective about the mini bottle however. I bought the &amp;#34;flash&amp;#34; version of Jimmy Choo as well and did not have this problem. The mini comes with a tiny plug stopper that you pull out (when it is fresh and brand new) then the cap should fit on and be the stopper. On this one the cap does not fit and the perfume will pour out rather than dab. I didn&#x27;t have that problem with the Flash, just this one. So much got spilled after the first time I tried opening it and using it again. Not sure if I got a wonky bottle of if the design for this cap is just not very good. But love the fragrance nonetheless!</li>
    <li> Smells great. But I did not read the size properly so that&#x27;s my fault. One of my favorite scent. Would buy again buy bigger size. This size is not even tester worthy but I love me some Jimmy choo</li>
    <li> Lovely scent. It reminds me of Flower bomb.</li>
    <li> I loved this perfume. I ordered the sampler one as I wanted to see what it smelled like.&lt;br /&gt;Loved it.  Linda rushin</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast, however the bottle is tiny; not much bigger than a free sample at a dept store. AND it&#x27;s not a spray, so it has a little tiny stopper that you have to pry off, then the perfume spills. Spend 20 more if you like the fragrance and buy the small spray. The fragrance doesn&#x27;t stay on me at all so I won&#x27;t be ordering a larger one, unless I try the tester and it stays longer. This could have been a knock-off, I just don&#x27;t know. It was not in a box or anything.</li>
    <li> Love it...lol now i have to hide it from my girls...</li>
    <li> Beautiful perfume, but very small bottle.</li>
    <li> Ordered this small version just to try it out.  It is amazing!  Have already ordered the larger bottle also.</li>
    <li> I always receive compliments when wearing the scent! Great for going out at night. Not too strong and don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
    <li> IIt was a humble amount.and served my purposes well! I will order this again. I love this fragrance and it is not overwork this way:)</li>
    <li> What a joke, this mini bottle of scent was as tiny as a thimble...samples given out at department stores are more generous!</li>
    <li> I loved the scent of this Parfum.  Too bad it was so small,&lt;br /&gt;it was gone in 5 applications.  I will order a larger one&lt;br /&gt;next time.</li>
    <li> Was excited to try this, but way too strong for my taste.  Gave to my best friend.</li>
    <li> wife thinks it just so so. glad it comes in a small bottle to sample</li>
    <li> I really loved this one by Jimmy Choo I wish I had brought a large bottle. I will do that the next time.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. Beautiful fragrance. Not overpowering. Get many compliments on it from both men and women.&lt;br /&gt;Not carried in most local dept. stores.  So glad Amazon has it!</li>
    <li> My daughter loved the pocket book sized bottle and was surprised since I also bought the regular sizes Jimmy Choo.</li>
    <li> everyone told me, and has said this smell is amazing. So i figured i would try it out in a sample first. I dont know if this specific one is off, or old but it has a funky smell to me. I cant imagine this being the smell everyone is raving about. I will have to go to a department store to check it out and see if it smells differently.</li>
    <li> This is now my most favorite !</li>
    <li> someone was wearing this perfume when I was out for dinner and I liked it so much I had to ask this stranger what it was -she told me so I ordered it-this will be the first time Im going to wear it when I get it in the mail</li>
    <li> Im not sure what the deal is with this, maybe i should have purchased it from a different seller! I had a large bottle of this purfume about 3 months ago, and it accidently busted in my purse and spilled, months later the smell is still in my purse and it smells incredible. When i apply this newly purchased perfume to my pressure points in the morning, i cant even smell it 5 mins later! Doesnt last like the original product. jimmy choo meshes very well with my body chemistry, i dont know what this is!</li>
    <li> Not as great as I hoped  I won&#x27;t order it again  I spelled it in a magazine and it did not smell anything thing the one it bought.  glad I did not spend lots of money.</li>
    <li> I have received the item on time as specified by the shipping date. The perfume has a nice scent but is a little bit strong. Once you start to wear it,  the scent becomes lighter. Other than that I am satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and the person who recieved it loves it..My sister told me that she will buy again</li>
    <li> Great scent and fast delivery...the price was unbeatable...I had the same fragrance in a smaller bottle that was more than I payed for the large bottles...can&#x27;t beat that</li>
    <li> It really wasn&#x27;t the size I expected.</li>
    <li> Bottle was too small. I thought it would be a little larger. However it smelled good.</li>
    <li> it was old/sticki and i was disapointed</li>
    <li> I only wanted to try Jimmy Choo Eau De Parfum so I just got a small one  I liked it so much I have gotten more.  Thanks</li>
    <li> The very small but still expensive size has NO fragrance, and surely not like the original bottle I smelled at the&lt;br /&gt;department store.  I was less than satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is a delicious smelling perfume.  I ordered this travel size bottle to make sure that I liked it.  I finished it and am looking forward to getting a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened here but my perfume smells like nothing, nada, like lightly flagrance water maybe. Also, how in the world do you get the product out of the bottle? It doesn&#x27;t come with a spray or anyway to actually use the product. very odd.</li>
    <li> I love the parfum BUT the size of the bottle was MUCH smaller than it appeared online.  I expected more and I was a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> Service was excellent.  However, I didn&#x27;t like the scent and would not re-order it.  I was not familiar with the scent beforehand but used the description as a guide.  Not the fault of the seller.</li>
    <li> A great product, and my wife really enjoyed it... it is one of her favorite scents and now it is one of mine as well.</li>
    <li> I was looking all over for this perfume to get for a decent price. I was very happy with the perfume, packaging and timeliness of delivery. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. The perfume itself smells great, the scent is perfect for the fall weather.</li>
    <li> This is a nice scent.  I always suggest buying a small amount befor buying a big bottle of it.  It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> The bottle is small enough to tuck in your purse ane we both loved the scent. This would make a great sticking stuffer</li>
    <li> i love jimmy choo...but for some reason i expected it to be bigger :/ i cant believe i spent so much for this size... im loving the scent though. just a bit disappointed ..its smaller in size than the picture on-screen... :/. ah well</li>
    <li> The shipping and Jimmy Choo is just answsome ...  Mimi for woman... The smell is so Lovely and it last on me all day shut a Great Smell</li>
    <li> Totally love this scent!  I bought one for myself and my mother in law and she was totally hooked as well.</li>
    <li> so nice to be able to purchase this small size to see if you like the smell.  Not positive I like the smell, so I&#x27;ll have to think about whether or not I wish to purchase an expensive larger bottle.  It smells fancy and I&#x27;m not an extraordinarily fancy individual.  But I&#x27;m sure glad I didn&#x27;t spend 70 dollars on a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> Love the smell will purchase the big bottled of the jimmy choo by jimmy choo.</li>
    <li> the bottle  was too small.</li>
    <li> shipped on time...Same smell, but rather have the spray...next time I will purchase the spray bottle next time. Still one of my faves.</li>
    <li> Got this as a stocking stuffer for my extended family for christmas and it was a huge hit! She loved it and has since ordered more for her everyday use. The fragrance is very subtle, yet bold. And definitely without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> Disappointed - the scent doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
    <li> The tiniest bottle of cologne I have ever seen.  Love Jimmy Choo but not such a little sample.</li>
