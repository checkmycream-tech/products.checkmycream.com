      <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
      <li>Very discouraging!!!!</li>

      <li>Very fast shipping!!</li>
      <li>I am very happy with the quality , the savings and, the little time it took to arrived ...</li>
      <li>Do yourself a HUGE favor.  </li>
      <li>foot shaver replacement blades, i cant find them anywhere local,  but they are great for the feet.</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s assume that people who need those warnings aren&#x27;t going to heed them so - they fit.  </li>
      <li>Very handy to have enough blades.  </li>
      <li>Now that I am past the age that she was at that time, I confess I found myself on the hunt for the perfect pedicure items for those of us prone to alligator feet!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not going to write any more reviews since this is requiring me to write a certain number of words.</li>
      <li>Caution, go lightly the first time, and always on WELL SOAKED tootsies.</li>
      <li>Works better if I use a new blade each time.</li>
      <li>These blades will fit any store bought callus shaver, but works very well with the Tweezerman brand.  </li>
      <li>These blades don&#x27;t cut worth a darn.</li>
      <li>This is the only truly effective way for me to remove calluses from my heels.</li>
      <li>100 is far more</li>
      <li>Economical to buy.  </li>
      <li>my feet are callus free just what I needed I highly recommend these blades for anyone who have a blade handle.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>Real women use blades!</li>
      <li>Better than buying ten in the store up town.</li>
      <li>My bandaged foot will only let me give four stars even though my smooth heels vote for the full five.</li>
      <li>Nice and sharp</li>
      <li>What I really love is being able to stock up on the blades since they&#x27;re so hard to find around town.</li>
      <li>Blades work great, and this really helps with my tough callus&#x27;s on my feet.  </li>
      <li>just that it&#x27;s stainless steel with a plastic handle and made in Germany -</li>
      <li>Buying 100 at a time is a real bargain.</li>
      <li>Supper fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I suspect they are really made in China even though it states &#x27;Germany&#x27; on the blade.  </li>
      <li>the whole family foots just because.</li>
      <li>all very well.fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Less is more, a bit of callus is supposed to on our feet.</li>
      <li>Turn the double edged blade around for the second foot, then toss it, never use more than once.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d be very surprised indeed if these were actually made in Germany, since I&#x27;m very familiar with German workmanship.  </li>
      <li>It is not hard to install them but did take a minute to figure it out.  </li>
      <li>Hands love them + the Bag Balm I recently ordered for a few Crossfit hand tears.</li>
      <li>Go slow and easy.  </li>
      <li>I had purchase similar  blades at a beauty supply and some are not sharp enough to do the job.  </li>
      <li>Anyone using a callus remover know the blades dull quickly.  </li>
      <li>I have several handles for this every time the blade gets dull now with fresh shape blades</li>

<li> Sharp blades are necessary to keep the shaver from \\&quot;grabbing\\&quot; instead of shaving</li>
<li> This is really the only way I can remove thick dead skin from my feet.</li>
<li> Remove the blade every few passes to clear off the bits of dead skin that accumulate.</li>
<li> You need to be careful of course not to cut yourself.  </li>
<li> I was having trouble finding these replacement blades in my local drugstores.  </li>
<li> Careful, sharp?  </li>
<li> Forget the ped-egg, it stays sharp for about a minute.</li>
<li> They are sharp and there are 100 of them.</li>
<li> sharp as all hell.</li>
<li> And for goodness sake, take your time, it is a sharp blade.</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s a luxury to have plenty of blades on hand so that I can always keep a sharp blade in the shaver.</li>
<li> Flip the blade around and do the other foot.</li>
<li> Sharp blades.</li>
<li> careful, you&#x27;ll draw blood!</li>
<li> I get two uses out of each as both sides are sharp.</li>
<li> I shave my calluses dry - a little every few days or so</li>
<li> They also stay very sharp with repeated use.</li>
<li> When I was a little girl, I remember seeing a callus razor of my mothers, and wondered why anyone would use one.</li>
<li> Work extremely well and hard to find in stores.</li>
<li> (The directions failed to include the fact that the plastic trim piece was actually a blade lock that had to be removed before the blade could slide out.)</li>
<li> Also, changing blades often is a plus for me, I don&#x27;t like dull blades.</li>
<li> If you go in at the wrong angle, you can slice a chunk of flesh off your foot, so be very careful.</li>
<li> but they are too wimpy for my tough calluses.</li>

    <li> These blades are very easy to change out on the tweezerman safety took callous remover. I couldn&#x27;t find these in stores and am very happy with my purchase. Hands love them + the Bag Balm I recently ordered for a few Crossfit hand tears.</li>
    <li> all very well.fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Very handy to have enough blades.  Well packed.  Economical to buy.  Will buy again once I need them again.</li>
    <li> Great buy.  Sharp blades.</li>
    <li> This is a good price and I am happy with the quality of the blades.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> foot shaver replacement blades, i cant find them anywhere local,  but they are great for the feet. Just don&#x27;t cut your self.</li>
    <li> I have several handles for this every time the blade gets dull now with fresh shape blades my feet are callus free just what I needed I highly recommend these blades for anyone who have a blade handle.</li>
    <li> Works great! Better than buying ten in the store up town. Great deal.</li>
    <li> I use these for my callus remover. I get two uses out of each as both sides are sharp. This is really the only way I can remove thick dead skin from my feet. Buying these in bulk saves money.</li>
    <li> Steel as it supposed to be.</li>
    <li> have been using for years... great :-)</li>
    <li> What else can you say?  Careful, sharp?  Do not let children play with these?  Let&#x27;s assume that people who need those warnings aren&#x27;t going to heed them so - they fit.  It is not hard to install them but did take a minute to figure it out.  (The directions failed to include the fact that the plastic trim piece was actually a blade lock that had to be removed before the blade could slide out.)</li>
    <li> Product as described, good delivery time - thanks!</li>
    <li> I had purchase similar  blades at a beauty supply and some are not sharp enough to do the job.  I am very happy with the quality , the savings and, the little time it took to arrived ...iam very happy with this product...thank you</li>
    <li> Still got razors to this day got a million of them lol.do the whole family foots just because. Nice nice</li>
    <li> I do Crossfit and this is a must. This is the best price I have been able to find. This package should last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Buying 100 at a time is a real bargain.</li>
    <li> I buy these in a store locally and have spent just under $5 for 10 blades.  What a great deal this was and I got them very quickly.</li>
    <li> Good blades for a good price, and these fit my device just fine.  100 is far more then I&#x27;ll ever need but the box is tiny so I can easily store them.</li>
    <li> They are sharp and there are 100 of them. What more could you ask for? lol</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping!! Very satisfied with product too!</li>
    <li> arrived on time. Will last a while. Nice and sharp</li>
    <li> I was having trouble finding these replacement blades in my local drugstores.  Very pleased to find a package containing 100 blades. Anyone using a callus remover know the blades dull quickly.  Also, changing blades often is a plus for me, I don&#x27;t like dull blades. Package came just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Love my callus remover !! quick service good products</li>
    <li> If I could give a zero I would.  These blades don&#x27;t cut worth a darn. I&#x27;d be very surprised indeed if these were actually made in Germany, since I&#x27;m very familiar with German workmanship.  These blades don&#x27;t cut it.  I suspect they are really made in China even though it states &#x27;Germany&#x27; on the blade.  I have seen the same situation with china (dishes, etc.) where the dish/plate indicates it&#x27;s made in England when in fact it&#x27;s made in China.  Very discouraging!!!!</li>
    <li> Product was as described.  Good value, good price.  Would recommend to others.  I&#x27;m not going to write any more reviews since this is requiring me to write a certain number of words.</li>
    <li> I make my pedicure by myself and can not find blades in any store. I am glad that I can buy it on Amazon.  The blades are the same as on the picture. I got it on time.</li>
    <li> This is the only truly effective way for me to remove calluses from my heels. What I really love is being able to stock up on the blades since they&#x27;re so hard to find around town. I bought 100, ten lil boxes of ten. Works better if I use a new blade each time. Warning: there is a learning curve to this task. If you go in at the wrong angle, you can slice a chunk of flesh off your foot, so be very careful. Sort of feel your way around your heel with it to achieve the best and safest results. Don&#x27;t try to dig too deep. Kinda like peeling potatoes. Remove the blade every few passes to clear off the bits of dead skin that accumulate. Flip the blade around and do the other foot. And for goodness sake, take your time, it is a sharp blade. My bandaged foot will only let me give four stars even though my smooth heels vote for the full five.</li>
    <li> fit my tool fine...sharp as all hell. careful, you&#x27;ll draw blood! (it&#x27;s telling me I need to add 9 more words, hope this does it)</li>
    <li> Blades work great, and this really helps with my tough callus&#x27;s on my feet.  You need to be careful of course not to cut yourself.  Go slow and easy.  Best used after a bath or shower.</li>
    <li> When I was a little girl, I remember seeing a callus razor of my mothers, and wondered why anyone would use one. Now that I am past the age that she was at that time, I confess I found myself on the hunt for the perfect pedicure items for those of us prone to alligator feet! Forget the ped-egg, it stays sharp for about a minute. Real women use blades! Caution, go lightly the first time, and always on WELL SOAKED tootsies. Less is more, a bit of callus is supposed to on our feet. Turn the double edged blade around for the second foot, then toss it, never use more than once. Buying them like this is the cheapest way to go. These are great quality blades at a great price.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Work extremely well and hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> Do yourself a HUGE favor.  Buy the Microplane foot rasp through Amazon.  You will NEVER USE A RAZOR on your feet again.  Look up the rash, look at the reviews.  Try it.  The only regret you will have is you did not find it sooner.</li>
    <li> I never thought to look for these blades on the internet and kept buying the revlon callus shaver with the 5 included blades repeatedly. I never could find replacement blades in Rite Aid, Walgreens or CVS.  These blades will fit any store bought callus shaver, but works very well with the Tweezerman brand.  They also stay very sharp with repeated use. I know I won&#x27;t have to order new blades for a few years.</li>
    <li> Again, I saw a great produt and did not read I had one in my cart already. I was pleasantly suprised when two packages arrived. I now have blades to last my entire life.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Supper fast shipping. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Works like the originals</li>
    <li> Have used for years so I know I can trust it. Quality is always there.</li>
    <li> Great shipping and item</li>
    <li> My callus shaver is the only thing that works on my calluses. I&#x27;ve tried pumice stones, callus files, and the like but they are too wimpy for my tough calluses. I shave my calluses dry - a little every few days or so and they no longer are problematic. I have no idea what make or model my callus shaver is - just that it&#x27;s stainless steel with a plastic handle and made in Germany - but these blades fit it perfectly. Sharp blades are necessary to keep the shaver from \\&quot;grabbing\\&quot; instead of shaving so it&#x27;s a luxury to have plenty of blades on hand so that I can always keep a sharp blade in the shaver.</li>
