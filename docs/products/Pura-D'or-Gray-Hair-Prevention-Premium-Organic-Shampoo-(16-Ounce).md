      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>product is amazing as all the reviews stays...</li>
      <li>Amazing shampoo.</li>
      <li>Now, however, I like how AC brand leaves my hair nice and shiny; BUT I would settle not losing hair for any brand...</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s be honest, miracle in a bottle products tend to be snake oil.</li>
      <li>It is really nice shampoo though.</li>
      <li>My hair always felt kind of stripped downed after each washing do I can see how it would cause dryness in some reviewers.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Seems to blend in quite nicely from a distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It lathers up nicely.</li>
      <li>I Dont even believe it comes from where they say, and I Dont believe it is the kind of oil they say it</li>
      <li>I knew the reviews were too good to be true</li>
      <li>To good to be true</li>
      <li>It sounded too good to be true?</li>
      <li>I tried this product at a friend&#x27;s house in her guest bathroom and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard about Catalase enzyme</li>
      <li>&quot; brand (AC) for many months</li>
      <li>Better than any shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I now have more gray hair than ever.</li>
      <li>: I want to make sure you all know that I don&#x27;t work for the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It surely nourishes hair follicles.</li>
      <li>Perhaps it is preventing more gray hair?</li>
      <li>Today makes a month since I&#x27;ve been using this Pura d&#x27;or Gray hair and I am even more amazed than before.</li>
      <li>I will happily close my nose and thanks for the rest of my life</li>
      <li>and i am so glad that i can now stop using those vile smelling chemical conconctions.</li>
      <li>I am going to use this product one more time, then I will write another review, hopefully better than this, I have fate.</li>
      <li>I love them.  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So In 2 months I expect some results, if this shampoo will really darken some isolated  gray hairs I have on front of my head it will be for me a great product</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!complete change in my hair...</li>
      <li>, my hair has never looked this healthy and since i also apply it to my face my wrinkles are deminishing and</li>
      <li>For me, this is more than I would ever pay for shampoo-</li>
      <li>Just add more gel to your temples or use Vitalis to moisturizer your hair.</li>
      <li>So as of now it&#x27;s not working for the gray, but hair and face are healthy.</li>
      <li>I lose more</li>
      <li>As with all of this company&#x27;s products, you can expect high quality, quick delivery and excellent communication.</li>
      <li>It is cool and amazing.</li>
      <li>My hair looks pretty good and is not getting grayer.</li>
      <li>This best shampoo is a gift for treating grey hair.</li>
      <li>As for the Grey hair treatment I think the best remedy seems to be resignation!.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
      <li>Everybody should seems to be smart and good looking.</li>
      <li>I have used this organic, gentle shampoo for about 6 weeks now and i am delighted with the results.</li>
      <li>and I can see them easily.</li>
      <li>Some parts of my head are light brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>ENJOY YOUR PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>I am thirty and have light brown hair.</li>
      <li>Gray hair is caused by a decrease of blood flow to the scalp which reduces the catalase available to the pore that surrounds your hair follicle.</li>
      <li>My hair is still brown and light.</li>
      <li>I also love Amazon, because I know that I will receive quality product at a reasonable price from reputable sellers.</li>
      <li>The natural ingredients are organic herbals give freshness to hair and good fragrance.</li>
      <li>but I am so excited about this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Pura d&#x27;or gray hair prevention for 3 months now and have not seen any significant results.  </li>
      <li>but I am so excited about this product.</li>
      <li>They probably paid people to give them positive ratings so they could sell more.</li>
      <li>and I use less product in my hair after using this-so I would say that despite the price tag-it is still a good buy!</li>
      <li>Prevention\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a full head of hair</li>
      <li>It is much softer and managable and I love it.</li>
      <li>The only thing I thought was good with nizoral that it helped stop itching on my scalp/reduced the amount of dandruff.</li>
      <li>Although I did not leave it on for a full two minutes each time I was hoping that I would still see some benefit</li>
      <li>I think this product is good for everyone who want to take back her youth.</li>
      <li>the only good deed it did</li>
      <li>About to throw bottle away at 3/4 of way full and Dont care.</li>
      <li>My hair is nice and soft but it does not deliver what it advertises.</li>
      <li>like the quick shipping.</li>
      <li>Here is what this product does, it is like a super conditioner, if you were to take a shower and put hair gel on your graying temples your gray hair would look darker and not as gray.</li>
      <li>I used to use many brands, and the most recent is</li>
      <li>With the organic &amp; vitamins present in it, a very safe hair care product.</li>
      <li>I think the main ingredients responsible for darkening the hair are Emu oil, castor and amla oil and this shampoo has all 3.I also like that it cleans my hair quite nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
      <li>I was getting more and more grey hair</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, it smells absolutely delicious, and it makes my greying black hair glossy and soft.  </li>
      <li>The only positive is that its organic and smells good.</li>
      <li>my hair is more soft than before in just one week.</li>
      <li>The natural organic herbals make healthy hair without side effects.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great Shampoo, but as for gray hair prevention definitively not. Used 3/4 of the bottle and so far no change.</li>
    <li> For me, this shampoo is all about having a beautiful, healthy and glamorous hair. It prevents gray hair, thereby giving you a youthful look.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo has all the main ingredients for darkening hair, for example; Emu oil, castor and amla oil.</li>
    <li> This best shampoo is a gift for treating grey hair. The natural ingredients are organic herbals give freshness to hair and good fragrance. This prevents premature grey hairs. Treating splited hair and hair falls even treating dandruff also. The natural organic herbals make healthy hair without side effects. I recommend this shampoo to my friends and relatives.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing!! I&#x27;m a 29 year old and I&#x27;ve had gray hair for almost 3 years. I&#x27;ve tried everything from dying to just plucking out the strands. I tried this shampoo based on a couple of reviews and I&#x27;m happy that I did. I still have my grays BUT I&#x27;ve noticed that when I pluck, they&#x27;re not growing back! Awesome prevention shampoo!</li>
    <li> UPDATE (May 10, 2013): Doesn&#x27;t seem to work, BUT it does slow down my hair lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I want to make sure you all know that I don&#x27;t work for the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have some gray hair that I often pluck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this product for a week, so my review is based on this time of usage. So, I will only tell you about what I notice so far using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, it&#x27;s amazing that it helps SLOW down my hair loss! (I know that I will update in a month or two for the gray-hair report.) But so far, it slows or to certain extent stops my hair loss! I used to use many brands, and the most recent is \\&quot;American Crew\\&quot; brand (AC) for many months, my hair loss was noticeable. Now, however, I like how AC brand leaves my hair nice and shiny; BUT I would settle not losing hair for any brand...and this is it...\\&quot;Pura d&#x27;or\\&quot;! Pura d&#x27;or smell great to me compare to AC. Moreover, I notice that I only need to use very little to produce a lot of lather. So, one bottle can last quite a bit. Overall, I REALLY like this product. Will buy again just for this result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I will report back, here under this review, in a couple of months about how well it helps my gray hair.</li>
    <li> I am thirty and have light brown hair. I have to say this product works greatly. When my best friend let me try it, I was skeptical. After one-month treatment it has cleared red traces of my previous dyes and covered the first white hair.</li>
    <li> 1) This product is in my opinion a bit overpriced.But  It smells good, it is concentrated, and cleans well.&lt;br /&gt;2) As for the Grey hair treatment I think the best remedy seems to be resignation!.&lt;br /&gt;3) Good customer service</li>
    <li> did not work at all plain and simple</li>
    <li> Product  didn&#x27;t  work. It does not cover gray hair as stated.</li>
    <li> Agree! does not work. What a shame the marketing info states one thing to help with graying and the product does absolutely nothing as promised!</li>
    <li> that&#x27;s the product i have ever used. It is cool and amazing. it gives pretty much shine look to my hair. by the time i recommend you to use this hair prevention oil. you can experience a real situation. Not like other oils. Some oils give us side effects like removing hair. But this one heavily protects hair and gives cool and shiny look.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot who invent such a product.</li>
    <li> I purchased aug. 2012 and used faithfully two to three times/week every week for exactly one year (thus two stars and not one for the concentrated shampoo to last that long). At first it gave me dandruff and then as my hair adjusted it smelled nice but washed like any other nice natural shampoo but no \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; of gray hair prevention. My hair always felt kind of stripped downed after each washing do I can see how it would cause dryness in some reviewers. :-( As far as prevention - I have in fact all kinds of new gray hairs that sprang up all over my head the past year and did not see any new growth or stopping of incoming gray. I read tons of articles and there just isn&#x27;t any external stopping of gray, only covering.</li>
    <li> I tried this product at a friend&#x27;s house in her guest bathroom and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard about Catalase enzyme and I am really surprise to find a shampoo with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it once so I can&#x27;t tell that it works but the ingredients seems promising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying it here.</li>
    <li> Do you want to lock younger than your age? I think this product is good for everyone who want to take back her youth. This shampoo will helps you stop gray hair.</li>
    <li> This product is really a wonder for healthy hair, with natural color. Its results are great, makes silky hair post wash. It surely nourishes hair follicles. It can be used daily. With the organic &amp; vitamins present in it, a very safe hair care product. I recomond everyone to use this wonderful shampoo and see the results self.</li>
    <li> My hair is improving and getting gray hair disappear. I look forward now to attract and convince myself. Now I have no problem to deal with the public because gray hair is embarrassing me.Everybody should seems to be smart and good looking. So I&#x27;ll recommend it for you.A must try product!</li>
    <li> Im going thru diffuse hairlose (hair density decrease in all area of the head). My gf told me about this shampoo and how it has all natural ingredient that might help with my hair loss. I am 24 years old and have been dealing with hair loss since I was 21. Well Ive been using Anti-dandruff Nizoral (1% keto) for 6 months already and Ive havent see much improvement with my hairloss. Ive read some forums saying nizoral is good against hair loss if used every other day. The only thing I thought was good with nizoral that it helped stop itching on my scalp/reduced the amount of dandruff. So I got Pura d&#x27;or and have been using it for 2 months already and Im very pleased with it. Believe it or not, I am a hair freak and I count every single hair that falls from my head. I constantly checking my pillow and shoulders to find any strands of hair. When I take a shower, I clogged the shower drain and collect all the hair floating in the water. I have really long hair and I can see them easily. My girlfriend thinks I am crazy. haha! Just a little. But Ive noticed there was a drastic reduction in my hair loss in the shower. Before I used Pura d&#x27;or, I was losing +60 hair strands while showering and shampooing. After using pura d&#x27;or, I am losing around 25-35 hair while shampooing and showering. But there will be days where I lose about 40-50 hair, like today I did. I think if I stress too much I lose more hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is a bit expensive but I am happy that Ive seen some reduction of hair loss in the shower. I would recommend this shampoo since it is all natural and its suppose to add volume to your hair. I dont think it adds a whole lot, unless you blow dry your hair. I blow dry my hair with low heat and it becomes volumized, but as the day continues on, my hair goes back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions.....dont hesitate to ask.</li>
    <li> Did not prevent any gray hair for me.</li>
    <li> Used the pura d&#x27;or oil. It doesn&#x27;t do anything but cause my neck to break out in large welts. I Dont even believe it comes from where they say, and I Dont believe it is the kind of oil they say it is.just my personal experience. About to throw bottle away at 3/4 of way full and Dont care.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 4 months since I started using this product and I still have the same amount of gray hair.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> It sounded too good to be true? Well, it was!&lt;br /&gt;I have almost finished the bottle but don&#x27;t see a difference and no grey hair has darkened, as some of the other reviewers stated.  Don&#x27;t spend the $30, get your hair colored instead, if the grey bothers you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is nice and smells good, but it does not what it promises, and $30 for a bottle of shampoo is way to expensive.</li>
    <li> it is a good product just doesn&#x27;t get rid of the gray...&lt;br /&gt;A little expensive too for shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Well see in a month or so.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I have benefited from the anti-graying portion of this shampoo. But having a shampoo that supports my scalp health is always a good thing. Gray hair is caused by a decrease of blood flow to the scalp which reduces the catalase available to the pore that surrounds your hair follicle. As the cells surrounding the follicle metabolize the nutrients that are delivered, peroxide is generated. Without the extra catalase, the hair is bleached as it grows... Pura d&#x27;or supports me in supporting my scalp health.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I have a little gray hair here and there. My wife thought maybe I should try this. It is GREAT shampoo but it doesn&#x27;t get rid of gray hair at all. It is really nice shampoo though. But for eliminating grays, it does not do it. It is more of a natural shampoo. And a little pricey, but, You don&#x27;t use a lot so it does last long.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> I recently came across Pura D&#x27;or when i bought another product from this company. I have used this organic, gentle shampoo for about 6 weeks now and i am delighted with the results. I have been using chemical dies to cover up my gray hairs for a number of years now and i am so glad that i can now stop using those vile smelling chemical conconctions. My hair now not only looks better than it has in years, it is soft and silky and easier to style.&lt;br /&gt;Pura d&#x27;or has changed me so much and i have finally regained some self confidence. As with all of this company&#x27;s products, you can expect high quality, quick delivery and excellent communication.</li>
    <li> I do think is working, need to buy second time, !!!! Why not !!!!!</li>
    <li> Just 1 day ago arrived the parcel with 2 bottles of this shampoo. After just 1 usage my first impressions I can tell is I don&#x27;t like the smell so strong for me it has, but since its familiar smell I can taste even when I go to haidresser saloons, I now know its from the argan oil smell and its a familiar and not so unusual or rare ingredient as the producer claims so much, and however if this shampoo really lets to naturally darken gray hairs I will happily close my nose and thanks for the rest of my life the producer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never washed my hairs every day (scared to let them lose strength washing every day), and I will use this shampoo every 2 days trying to wait 10 minutes before rinse to give time at this shampoo to do his \\&quot;work\\&quot;. So In 2 months I expect some results, if this shampoo will really darken some isolated  gray hairs I have on front of my head it will be for me a great product and I will give a positive rate to it, if this shampoo fails these objectives it will have 1 star without compassion, considering the price and producer (Vital&#x27;s Cosmetics) claims it has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will start giving 3 stars for now to the product, I will update this review with my  final considerations and rate at end of september 2012.</li>
    <li> I have a little graying at the temples and a little gray thru-out the rest of my hair. I&#x27;ve used this for 8 weeks now (started on June 20, today is Aug 20) and used it every day per the instructions. No change in gray. Instructions say to lather and leave in for 2 minutes, I lather up my hair and lightly put lather on face as well and then wash my body with eyes closed, takes 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;Immediately made hair feel healthier, like it was extremely conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;When shampooing I use extra lather on face. Skin is f&#x27;n great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;8 weeks in, no change in gray, it says it could take up to 12 weeks to start working, I will update then.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get in your eyes, burns like a mofo.&lt;br /&gt;Price is a little high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if it doesn&#x27;t remove the gray I may keep using it because of how it conditions my hair so well and how it helps the skin on my face. I&#x27;ve received compliments on how my hair smells good, but keep in mind I also use gel in my hair. So as of now it&#x27;s not working for the gray, but hair and face are healthy. I will report back on Sept 20 when it hits the 12 week mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE- Started on June 20, it is now Oct 26, 16 weeks in. Still have graying temples. It looks about the the same. This product hasn&#x27;t done anything really for the grays. Here is what this product does, it is like a super conditioner, if you were to take a shower and put hair gel on your graying temples your gray hair would look darker and not as gray. It&#x27;s kinda the same idea, it super conditions your hair and that&#x27;s how it looks less gray, it may help someone but not really in my opinion. Just add more gel to your temples or use Vitalis to moisturizer your hair. Will I use it again? Yes. It may not be effective for the gray, but it makes my hair healthy as heck, my 15 yr old daughter started using it on her flat-iron dried out hair and it has helped. The product has good qualities. But in my case the gray claim didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ll report again in a month or 2 to let you all know if it just took a lot longer on me as I will continue using it. FYI I am late 40s male, Irish, pale skin, dark brown hair with graying temples. As I do this I have found out gray hair on men isn&#x27;t a bad thing, women like it. You&#x27;d be surprised. Ask them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of these broken English reviews seem suspect, I don&#x27;t work for them and am a regular guy.</li>
    <li> I am using yet. apparently is very good. my hair is more soft than before in just one week. i recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pura d&#x27;or gray hair prevention for 3 months now and have not seen any significant results.  Unfortunately it does not prevent gray hairs for me and I&#x27;ve been using this product everyday.  My hair is nice and soft but it does not deliver what it advertises.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait until I had given this product at least a few weeks or longer before I posted a review. I see no change in the amount of gray hairs on my head or in my facial hair. My opinion is that if you charge someone a ridiculous price for gray hair prevention shampoo then it should actully do what it promises. Otherwise, I could have bought a bottle of head and sholders for a fraction of the cost. Save your time and money on this one folks.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money, stopped using the product, did not do anything for my hair.  The product does not perform as stated.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product I like this very much. I think the main ingredients responsible for darkening the hair are Emu oil, castor and amla oil and this shampoo has all 3.I also like that it cleans my hair quite nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. I have only used it for 2 week so I can&#x27;t say that it works for a few gray hair strands.</li>
    <li> I am not sure how to get rid of gray hair naturally. I like this shampoo and am on my second bottle but do not think it changed gray hair back to dark hair. Perhaps it is preventing more gray hair? My hair looks pretty good and is not getting grayer. That said, the shampoo seems to be of excellent quality and made with excellent ingredients. The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is that I still have gray hair after using at least one and a half bottles over several months.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product.  I color my hair to cover my grey and thought I could use this product to help with the new growth so that I could just stop coloring it.  Bad idea.  Using the shampoo continually stripped the dye out of my hair and showed on my towel.  I just gave it to my grey-haired husband and will post his results after a few weeks.  The product is expensive and I hate to through it away.  I hope it works for him.</li>
    <li> Does this product reduce or prevent grey hair?  I have used it for several weeks, and do not think that this is so.  HOWEVER, it smells absolutely delicious, and it makes my greying black hair glossy and soft.  It also does not dull or yellow my hair like many other, non-blue shampoos do.  Because of the argan oil, I can use it daily and not dry out my hair or scalp, at least in the summertime.  I&#x27;m quite a fan of argan oil skin and hair care products, and Pura D&#x27;Or products are excellent quality at a middling price.  I love them.  I also love Amazon, because I know that I will receive quality product at a reasonable price from reputable sellers.</li>
    <li> I bought this thing 2 month ago, i use it everyday and still using it. it is absolutely useless.. it doesn&#x27;t improve the white hair growth nor improve the existing white hair. trust me dont waste your money. i have no idea how people are giving good ratings for this product. probably these ratings are given by people who work for the company or by people who get paid to review.</li>
    <li> For me, this is more than I would ever pay for shampoo-but I was interested in seeing if it got rid of some of my gray hair.  Although I can&#x27;t really say for sure if it does get rid of my gray-it does make my hair very soft and less frizzy.  I don&#x27;t use conditioner and I use less product in my hair after using this-so I would say that despite the price tag-it is still a good buy!</li>
    <li> I have been using this Pura d&#x27;or gray hair prevention sampoo for the last 4 months and I don&#x27;t see any of my gray hairs growing black at the roots. At first I plucked out gray ones to see if new ones growing black, then I had to stop it otherwise I would have a bolding scalp problem.  I guess there is a  reason for hair coloring business so big, that is &amp;#34; we don&#x27;t have a good product to reverse or really slow down the hair graying process.&amp;#34; Not only this one does not work as it claims, it gives me a itch, flaky scalp unless I use argan oil to sooth my scalp. It said it has argan oil as an ingredient so it seems weird. This one is definitely different than Kiehle&#x27;s argen oil sampoo. Anyway I am so disappointed at this sampoo. I guess I need to embrace my gray hair. Anyone knows what to do?</li>
    <li> The ingredients seem natural, leaves the hair soft and manageable but if this was indeed preventing gray hair it would be a world wide best seller, which isn&#x27;t. Well, although I read the positive reviews I didn&#x27;t have any high expectations, I don&#x27;t believe in miracles, but I thought I give it a try. The 2 reasons that I rated with 3 stars instead of 4 (or 4.5) are: the price is on the high side and of course item&#x27;s description \\&quot;Gray Hair Prevention\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a full head of hair and I need small quantities, one pump twice per shower, so the bottle lasts long enough, maybe 10 months, but not with daily use, as I also use nizoral twice a week. So the price is not an issue for a shampoo that lasts for long and I may be buying it again. I found it very decent shampoo with deceptive description.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. I bought two bottles, used the product religiously to no avail. The product is overpriced, the shipping is overpriced (when you purchase directly from the site)...I definitely DO NOT recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I cannot say for certain that my hair is less grey after two months of 1-2 uses per week, but it is not more grey. More importantly this shampoo is delightful. Great smell, no harsh laureates or other bad chems, and leaves my sometimes frizzy hair smooth and thick. Love it!</li>
    <li> UPDATE: Today makes a month since I&#x27;ve been using this Pura d&#x27;or Gray hair and I am even more amazed than before. I am African American and I am a CG girl (curly). After using Pura d&#x27;or Gray Hair Prevention for a month there isn&#x27;t a doubt that this will be added as a part of my staple products. People in my environment can see the 98% difference in my hair. I get compliments all the time now. It is much softer and managable and I love it. My hair is jet black again and that is what I wanted. As a adolescent, I&#x27;ve always had jet black hair and I thank God for this organic product. As with black hair you can see the gray strands more visibly but now that has changed. I&#x27;ve noticed the few strands from the scalp is getting darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATION: If you have colored hair than this may not be for you. If you are natural than it will likely be beneficial for you want your hair to continue with its normal color or if you have damaged color hair and you are wanting to get back your natural healthy hair (without chemicals) than I recommend you try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product makes your hair feel so silky soft. I personally cowash my hair with just conditioner  and I am looking forward to trying the Pura d&#x27;or&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner but if or when I do order it I will post my review of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I also used CANTU SHEA BUTTER LEAVE-IN CONDITIONER which I purchase from Amazon...as a part of my regimen. I hope my reviews help for I also left my review of Cantu as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the quick shipping. It arrives within a few days or less than a week for I dont have to wait weeks. When I give out it only takes about 3-4 DAYS to recieve it (LESS THAN WK) and that is GOOD in my book. I will continue to order from the same seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOPE THIS HELPS EVERYONE...ENJOY YOUR PRODUCT. LET ME KNOW YOUR RESULTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing as all the reviews stays...it is not like any other shampoo product I have ever used. I can see a complete change in my hair...my original color is black and now the gray that I have acquired through the years is now becoming black (original color). My hair becomes so healthy for it returns back to my high school years of when I had only complete healthy hair. I am 40 so my gray is premature and after one use, I see less strings of gray hair but I am so excited about this product. PURA D OR is so strong, it only takes a little bit for a complete lather. I leave it on 1 hr before rinse. A COMPLETE BLESSING. I LOVE IT!complete change in my hair...my original color is black and now the gray that I have acquired through the years is now becoming black (original color).

    <li> I have orderd 3 bottles of this product, I have completed one bottle and half for almost 4 months of using daily as recommended. But, unfortunately I have nothing changed, no single white hair has been changed color, to be fair one positive thing you can gain of using this product is that your hair will be thicker and the non-gray hair will be darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spent my money and time on usless product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll throught one and half bottles in garbage.</li>
    <li> I like it but the need time to I see calories</li>
    <li> *Update* It has been 4 weeks now since I have been diligently using this product as instructed. There has been NO visible differences in hair color. My hair is still brown and light. I have not got back my original jet black color. I knew the reviews were too good to be true and now I have experienced it myself. The reviews are paid and the reviewers are compensated by the company. DO NOT fall for this scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for about 20 days now with no visible results. The product says 4-6 weeks to show results, but I saw other reviewers who said they started seeing results in a week ! However, it did work great for my dandruff. My dandruff is almost gone. I use it everyday and leave it on for at least four minutes before I rinse. On weekends I leave it for about an hour. I will update my review after the 4 weeks and 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOOD FOR THOUGHT - EVERY other product by this company has the same &#x27;scammy&#x27; comments and reviews. Apparently every product seems to work like magic on its users. Come on, give us a break. If these products did such magic, in the next one year we will have NO bald people, NO gray haired people, NO people with dandruff left on this Earth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something that actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the reviews are mixed. Maybe it will not work for all and I was very hesitant to buy it after reading the negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a shot anyway and was going to return it if it didn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shower twice a day and used it both in the morning and at night before I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on my 9th week and the results are coming in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have pitch black hair but its getting lighter with age. Some parts of my head are light brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it is a darker brown color. I hope with continue used, it will be black again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 4 months, and I have not seen evident results yet. I have not seen any darkening of my hair, and my grays they are the same. I have been using this product every day. I leave the product in my hair for 4-5 minutes; just following directions. I am going to use this product one more time, then I will write another review, hopefully better than this, I have fate.</li>
    <li> - i&#x27;m 35 male, and i used it as recommend for every single day for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;- i took a photo for my hair every week. the result is nothing. i have the same percentage of while hair till now.&lt;br /&gt;- the only good deed it did, it stops the production of my hair dandruff, this is the only reason i didn&#x27;t through the bottle in the trash so far.</li>
    <li> i had about 70% gray and after 4 months of use i see a big change in the amount of gray not to mention all the new hair growth that i have and it&#x27;s my natural color, my hair has never looked this healthy and since i also apply it to my face my wrinkles are deminishing and my skin is smoother and firmer. you need to give this product time to work on gray as for the other benefits you will see them within a couple of weeks, i hope and pray that they do not stop selling this product. fyi one bottle will last you for about 4 months with daily use.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo but it did not work for me. A bottle lasts pretty long so it is pretty economical if it works. Although I did not leave it on for a full two minutes each time I was hoping that I would still see some benefit but I did not. Oh well, off to try other things such as PABA, SOD and copper supplements.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pura d or  for about a month and yes I&#x27;m seeing a reduction in the amount of gray. I like this product and a little go&#x27;s a long way. I am 51 and had premature graying starting in my late 30&#x27;s so I have quite a few gray to contain. Notice I said contain not hide or get read of. Look if you&#x27;re 50 or so hey you earned the gray and should be proud of it, however you want to contain the amount of it so you can wear it with pride and this product will help you achieve that.</li>
    <li> It is too soon to tell if this shampoo is working.  At this point, I see no change in the decrease of gray hair. On the other hand, no increase.  Perhaps I need to use it for a few months or another thirty days, but too costly to continue with no results.  In a month, I&#x27;ll try to write an updated review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/27/2012&lt;br /&gt;I have returned with a follow-up review of this product.  It has done nothing to decrease the graying of my hair.  The shampoo helps to decrease the loss of hair, but the reason for purchase was to decrease the graying of the hair.  I don&#x27;t mind purchasing a product that shows positive results but this one is too expensive with no change.</li>
    <li> After just one use, this shampoo made my scalp dry, extremely itchy and flaky. This was very disappointing considering the product claims to be all natural, organic and free from harsh ingredients. Obviously not the case if my scalp reacted this way.</li>
    <li> It is pretty easy to spot phony reviews on products here if you take a little time and read and cull the opinions within them. Obvious fake ones include \\&quot;I was skeptical at first\\&quot; or \\&quot;I do not work for company that sells this..\\&quot; It is too bad that the average person can no longer use these reviews to gauge the quality of items they are thinking of buying because of bogus reviews. This shampoo will do NOTHING to reverse gray hair and even worse it contains the carcinogen Phenoxyethanol which can do harm to a persons central nervous system. You would think for the ridiculous price they charge for this item it would at least be free of toxins.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. I have beed using this shampoo for over than a year and I feel stronger hair now.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to work for me after 2 and half months. I still have gray hair but it seems like a few shades darker than before so it is less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to blend in quite nicely from a distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have seen less new gray hair popping out (just my instinct) but I have not actually count and keep track of every strands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month, and my few strands of gray hair have not returned back to brown. I am 45 years old and have about 200 gray hairs on my head, mostly due to chemotherapy. I figure all I need is a little boost to get my hair back to the way it was before chemo (almost all dark brown). Now, I must say that I only shampoo every 2-3 days, so maybe that is the reason why this is ineffective. According to directions, you need to shampoo every day. But if I shampoo every day, my hair will be too dry, which brings me to the second point. This product is very drying. I can only put it on once. If I try to wash, rinse, repeat... the repeat washing will leave my hair very dry.&lt;br /&gt;On the positive, I like the smell of this shampoo. It lathers up nicely. I just hope it will work.&lt;br /&gt;I may update this review at a later date, especially if I start noticing a change for the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using this for half a year now and my gray hairs are still there and maybe increasing. I lowered my 2 star rating to 1 star because now I feel duped, cheated. How could they charge so much and deliver so little? They probably paid people to give them positive ratings so they could sell more. I am disappointed and mad.</li>
    <li> This did work on my grey hair, not only that, my hair felt better than it has in years.&lt;br /&gt;Love this shampoo, it is fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one months time you could see my roots were darker. Amazing shampoo.</li>
    <li> As you can see, I did purchase this shampoo. Let me tell you, save your money as this does not work. It;s a complete scam. Just get yourself horsetail shampoo which  at least works.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and used it daily for 2-3 months and didn&#x27;t see any lessening of gray hair. Let&#x27;s be honest, miracle in a bottle products tend to be snake oil. So if you plan on giving Pura d&#x27;or Gray Hair Prevention a try keep your expectations very low.</li>
    <li> Just finishing up a bottle which took about four months to use up.  Unfortunately, the shampoo does not seem to be an effective way to deliver the anti gray properties in the ingredients. Can&#x27;t blame them for trying. Otherwise it&#x27;s a decent shampoo for cleaning the hair, not changing the chemical properties of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I wish that it had worked.</li>
    <li> The whole bottle of shampoo is over without any change in any of the gray hair. Its too much of hassle to wash the hair everyday and get no results at all. The only positive is that its organic and smells good.</li>
    <li> delivery was so fast, smell good.i hope its helping me...........i am just start use, about one week, nothing to say, let see later</li>
    <li> Like many other people have said...&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for 6 months, and I have not seen evident results yet. I have not seen any darkening of my hair, and my grays they are the same. I have been using this product every day. I leave the product in my hair for 4-5 minutes; just following directions. I will use it until it is gone but I will not buy a new one. To good to be true I guess. Has anyone found a shampoo that actually works???</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo and the conditioner, and it left my hair dry and unmanageable.  I had to use a different conditioner on top of this one.  Didn&#x27;t blend in the grays.</li>
    <li> Been using product for over a month. No results at all yet&lt;br /&gt;however, I Shampoo twice a week not everyday.</li>
    <li> Since the label on this product states that you should wait 6-12 weeks to see results, I wanted to use the product for at least three months, before writing a review.&lt;br /&gt;After using this shampoo every day for three months, I can say for sure that the POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE LIES AND THIS IS ONE BIG SCAM. I now have more gray hair than ever. Not even a small change towards my original black hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor. Do not waste your hard earned money on this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this in August 2012 and used it exclusively for three months.......it&#x27;s horrible. My hair was in such awful shape when I finally stopped using it. It dried my hair making it looked terribly damaged and totally lifeless. Worst of all it dried out my scalp and caused it to be itchy and flaky. I never saw any difference in my few gray hairs. Embrace your gray or suck it up and color it. Nearly $40 down the drain.......</li>
    <li> I was getting more and more grey hair so I bought this shampoo. My grey stopped after about 3 months. Better than any shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. Still on my first bottle after 10 months. I will definately continue to buy this product. After I shower I use a couple squirts of Pura D&#x27;or Pure&amp;Organic Argan Oil and my dry hair is soft and manageable.</li>
