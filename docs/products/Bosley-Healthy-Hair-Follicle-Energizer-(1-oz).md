### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!  </li>
      <li>great transaction....</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product, just need better instructions...</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall the product is good</li>
      <li>good product.  </li>
      <li>Use on hair seems OK, but not quite as good as the Vivagen mens hair care product.</li>
      <li>I have used this product before ordering from Amazon and I liked it.</li>
      <li>It does make minoxidil more effective, so if you&#x27;re using just a minoxidil regrowth treatment it should help.</li>
      <li>However, I think that this product didn&#x27;t perform as well as Rogaine as I noticed more thinning than when I used Rogaine.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully soon I will be able to see my thinning areas filling in.</li>
      <li>Love it, use all Bosley products</li>
      <li>but I am satisfied.</li>
      <li>Hair Follicle Energizer works so much better</li>
      <li>You may have better luck</li>
      <li>Others might have better luck than Im having.</li>

      <li>Been using it with Bo&#x27;s minoxidil and shampoo hair looks fuller and clean will buy again.</li>

      <li>This is the first problem that I have experenced in ordering from</li>
      <li>Last shipment from you of two (2) Bossley Healthy Hair Follicle Energizer was received.  </li>

      <li>I havent seen the results yet because I dont know how much I have to wait</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it really works or not.</li>
      <li>I Don&#x27;t know if it was the combination of them or one worked better than another because I used one or the other every day.  </li>
      <li>But really didn&#x27;t notice a boost in new growth.</li>
      <li>Not greasy dry and clean makes hair look fuller like all Bosley products do.</li>
      <li>Product showed up quickly and was exactly as expected.  </li>
      <li>Most importantly it makes youtr hair look dirty, and greasy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After using this for a while, I had slacked off using Rogaine.  However, I think that this product didn&#x27;t perform as well as Rogaine as I noticed more thinning than when I used Rogaine.  I won&#x27;t rely on this product.</li>
    <li> okay but dries my hair</li>
    <li> The 1 oz. dispenser does not indicate remaining volume.  Difficult to tell when near end of product.  Use on hair seems OK, but not quite as good as the Vivagen mens hair care product.</li>
    <li> i noticed another review where he could not get anything out of the pump. so i will never know if this works or not because the pump is defective you cant get the stuff out to even use it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before ordering from Amazon and I liked it. It seems to work. The one I ordered from Amazon was either empty or the dispenser didn&#x27;t work properly because almost no product comes out when I pump it. I should have returned it but I didn&#x27;t use the product for awhile after ordering and didn&#x27;t have paperwork, etc left.&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product is good but I got a bad bottle.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product a short  while but I am satisfied.Hoping to see more improvement after I have used it more in the future.</li>
    <li> So far ok but didn&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
    <li> Great product, will definitely continue to buy as needed.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it works real well but I&#x27;ve been using it and it seems to be helping.  I will continue to get it.</li>
    <li> I love this as it&#x27;s so easy to use after my daily shower. My hair is fuller and thicker than ever.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product. It didn&#x27;t do anything for my scalp. But everybody&#x27;s bodies completely different. You may have better luck</li>
    <li> I wrote a previous review on one of the other bosley products and I feel the same about this one so I just did a copy and paste of  that review in each of the products I used.  I Don&#x27;t know if it was the combination of them or one worked better than another because I used one or the other every day.  Here is the original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am an afro-american woman, and noticed hair thinning on my crown for several months. I have tried several things to thicken my hair but nothing worked. I bought this product along with the conditioner, shampoo, hair regrowth treatment, and hair folicle energizer, I have only been using these for 4-6 weeks. My hair has always been slow to grow so I haven&#x27;t seen very much growth. But what I have noticed is less hair breakage. I hardly have hair in my comb now. For me, this is a plus, because before using these products my comb would be full of hair. Hopefully soon I will be able to see my thinning areas filling in.</li>
    <li> Love it, use all Bosley products</li>
    <li> I am still using the item it seems to be working. I don&#x27;t know if it really works or not. I to keep using to find out.</li>
    <li> This product helped grow my hair back.  I got a stressed balled spot on the side of my head. I applied a small drop to the spot every day and I slowly notice hair regrowth.  Now my hair has completely  grown back and sadly I forgot to track the time.  Hopefully this  stuff will help me in the frontal arrea where the thinning is in creasing.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great price</li>
    <li> I received the product on time but sadly when I opened the box I saw the bottle a little wet and when I try the nozzle nothing came out, it seemed the bottle was empty:( I returned it and I will probably never buy from this seller again(Yolo Beauty)and that&#x27;s why I give 1 star.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product for a thinning spot on the crown of my head.  She thinks it is helping, I&#x27;m not sold.  However, the bigger concern was that I ordered two containers.  One came empty!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I was trying to repair my hair following chemo. I was using a similar product which after a long time managed to stop my hair from falling out but I was looking for more, the fullness I&#x27;d had before. So I ordered this product and in a short while my hair started falling out again. Keep in mind my situation may be different than many others but I feel that my purpose is what the product was advertised for. Also, it makes your hair oily so you can only use it when you come home for the day and wash your hair in the AM.</li>
    <li> Ive used this for months and I cant see any difference in my hair. It is still getting thinner and what hair I do have hangs limply. Not happy with the results so far. I will keep using this product and hope that things improve. Others might have better luck than Im having. Anyways be careful if you purchase this. Its rather expensive and not very effective.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, just need better instructions... I havent seen the results yet because I dont know how much I have to wait</li>
    <li> Great product!  Truly helps your hair!</li>
    <li> Last shipment from you of two (2) Bossley Healthy Hair Follicle Energizer was received.  Yesterday I opened one and found that the product had leaked out and saturated the cardboard packaging which was enclosed in plastic wrap.  The product package and container was empty but does not appear damaged in any way.  I opened the second package and found the same situtation. I like this product and have ordered a number of them from you in the past.  This is the first problem that I have experenced in ordering from you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that these items should be replaced no charge.  I have saved the containers and packaging if you would like to have them returned to you.  With two packages doing this I would think that there must be other folks experiencing this problem.</li>
    <li> Right on time - good product</li>
    <li> Medication has caused my hair to become thin and unhealthy.  My hair stylist recommended that I use Bosley&#x27;s  products.  I have been using the complete line of the products since January and the results are much more positive than any I have used to date.</li>
    <li> No problems....great transaction....good product.  Would purchase from this seller again. A+</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because the product works. I have hair lost and Bosley help me gain my hair back.</li>
    <li> Sorry, first of all it smell&#x27;s like a medicine cabinet. Most importantly it makes youtr hair look dirty, and greasy. I do not think it help&#x27;s with hair loss at all...</li>
    <li> I have not noticed anything different after using this product. My hair is baby fine and I thought this product would have boosted the follicles. But really didn&#x27;t notice a boost in new growth.</li>
    <li> Product showed up quickly and was exactly as expected.  I do not think I have any definitive answers as to if this product works.</li>
    <li> Applewel Therapeutics Apple Gain Hair Follicle Energizer works so much better and  it is cheaper. Applewel should have its website up and running in the Spring 2013.</li>
    <li> Not greasy dry and clean makes hair look fuller like all Bosley products do. Been using it with Bo&#x27;s minoxidil and shampoo hair looks fuller and clean will buy again.</li>
    <li> It does make minoxidil more effective, so if you&#x27;re using just a minoxidil regrowth treatment it should help.</li>
    <li> SAME AS ABOVE THIS IS GOLD IN A BOTTLE!!!</li>
    <li> I think it has helped my hair growth.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and I can&#x27;t find anything better.</li>
