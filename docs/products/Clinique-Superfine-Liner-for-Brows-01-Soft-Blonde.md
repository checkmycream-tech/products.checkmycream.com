      <li>I have used item this for many years and have tried many others but nothing has been even close to this product!</li>
      <li>so I really needed my Clinique brow liner to come to the rescue lol).</li>
      <li>You twist the end to bring up more pencil.</li>
      <li>I love the brow liner by Clinique, but two of the three liners sent to me don&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>and I get overheated easily so</li>
      <li>easy to use because it is comes out of the pencil smoothly</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge Clinique fan - 15+ years</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know where another reviewer has been finding the Clinique brand superfine liner for &amp;#34;5-7 dollars cheaper&amp;#34;... Please enlighten us.</li>
      <li>so I am familiar with how it works.</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite eye brow pencil.</li>
      <li>This superfine brow liner is just right for me.</li>
      <li>This is the best blonde brow color I&#x27;ve found, all others are a bit on the red side.  </li>
      <li>have fair skin (easily burns, rarely tans) with freckles, light eyes and have light Auburn hair (light brown with red &amp; blonde tones</li>
      <li>Just the right color for blondes</li>
      <li>I have gotten eye brow pencil before it was very good this time the pencil was must have been dropped it was broken up.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>and I personally think it&#x27;s worth paying $20 + free shipping on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t put much on when I use brow pencil</li>
      <li>so maybe I&#x27;m biased when I say I love this product (in soft blonde).</li>
      <li>Gave 4 stars because shipping was 11 days, product just as described, brand new, correct color.</li>
      <li>I went to a local drug store on a mission and bought a couple different brands in Taupe, Blonde/Brown, Light Blonde etc.</li>
      <li>For a first time buyer I would suggest a trip to Macy&#x27;s or Clinique outlet to try it first (also, maybe try walking over to the nearest window so you can see what it looks like in natural lighting as well as harsh, blaring makeup department lights)!</li>
      <li>like it but the light blonde color seems to have a touch of green in it.</li>
      <li>I am a redhead &amp; this is the only natural looking brow pencil I have ever found.</li>
      <li>I barely have the color tip exposed &amp; the breakage continues.</li>

<li> I LOVE this brow pencil, but I was disappointed that this one ran out so quickly compared to the same pencil I bought in the past at Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
<li> I have auburn hair, but all of the red hues are just...too red, and brown is too dark.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time</li>
<li> so I have a tough mix to find just the right match for brow liner).</li>
<li> (I accidentally over-plucked a little on one eyebrow and had a party to go to the next day</li>
<li> - I&#x27;ve also found a few black and white hairs lately [in the early stages of going Salt &amp; Pepper]</li>
<li> It needs to have a small brush added to the opposite end</li>
<li> No complaints about Clinique&#x27;s liner running down my face</li>
<li> I&#x27;m making due with the Taupe Jordana brand (and blotting a little off with tissue to lighten it) until my Amazon order arrives.&lt;br</li>
<li> For some reason I have little to no eyebrows which has been a challenge.</li>
<li> Packaging a little skimpy, but merchandise arrived undamaged.</li>
<li> If you want eyebrows just like Joan Crawford, this is one of many pencils that will give you that artificial and scary look.</li>
<li> that has to mean something.</li>
<li> And that happened to me last weekend at the worst possible time</li>
<li> I am sorry I wasted my money on this product.  </li>
<li> I tried twisting the liner and low and behold, I was out :(</li>
<li> The price here is horrible, you can find this pencil at any department store for $5 - $7 less</li>
<li> Ugh :(</li>
<li> :(&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
<li> Factoring in tax &amp; shipping online or a dreadful trip to the mall where they might be out of stock</li>

    <li> Arrived on time &amp; works Great! Packaging a little skimpy, but merchandise arrived undamaged. Would shop there again. great product great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M A STRAWBERRY BLONDE AND THIS IS THE PERFECT COLOR FOR ME.&lt;br /&gt;EASY TO APPLY AND REMOVE</li>
    <li> I am a redhead &amp; this is the only natural looking brow pencil I have ever found. It&#x27;s great!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My absolute favorite eye brow pencil. It needs to have a small brush added to the opposite end and then it would be perfect!</li>
    <li> I have gotten eye brow pencil before it was very good this time the pencil was must have been dropped it was broken up. Everytime I go to use it a clump forms on my eye brow.</li>
    <li> like it but the light blonde color seems to have a touch of green in it.</li>
    <li> I am sorry I wasted my money on this product.  As soon as I apply the pencil to area to color the tip breaks off.  I barely have the color tip exposed &amp; the breakage continues.</li>
    <li> I love this brow pencil!  This is the best blonde brow color I&#x27;ve found, all others are a bit on the red side.  However, I have never paid more than $15 before tax for this item!  The price here is horrible, you can find this pencil at any department store for $5 - $7 less</li>

    <li> I have auburn hair, but all of the red hues are just...too red, and brown is too dark.  This was absolutely perfect for my fair coloring and looks quite natural.</li>
    <li> This is a pencil, not a brush. If you want eyebrows just like Joan Crawford, this is one of many pencils that will give you that artificial and scary look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge Clinique fan - 15+ years so maybe I&#x27;m biased when I say I love this product (in soft blonde). The one downside is, as another customer mentioned, you cannot tell when you&#x27;re running out. And that happened to me last weekend at the worst possible time (I accidentally over-plucked a little on one eyebrow and had a party to go to the next day so I really needed my Clinique brow liner to come to the rescue lol). I tried twisting the liner and low and behold, I was out :( I tried using a &amp;#34;light brown&amp;#34; from Maybelline that I found at the bottom of my makeup bag and it came out like a rust/reddish brown color.. Ugh :( I went to a local drug store on a mission and bought a couple different brands in Taupe, Blonde/Brown, Light Blonde etc. trying to find a comparable replacement. I got home and NONE of these matched either. I&#x27;m making due with the Taupe Jordana brand (and blotting a little off with tissue to lighten it) until my Amazon order arrives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know where another reviewer has been finding the Clinique brand superfine liner for &amp;#34;5-7 dollars cheaper&amp;#34;... Please enlighten us. It&#x27;s $16 at Macy&#x27;s and on Clinique&#x27;s website. Factoring in tax &amp; shipping online or a dreadful trip to the mall where they might be out of stock and I personally think it&#x27;s worth paying $20 + free shipping on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin (easily burns, rarely tans) with freckles, light eyes and have light Auburn hair (light brown with red &amp; blonde tones - I&#x27;ve also found a few black and white hairs lately [in the early stages of going Salt &amp; Pepper] so I have a tough mix to find just the right match for brow liner).

Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> nice color for blonds</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brow pencil, but I was disappointed that this one ran out so quickly compared to the same pencil I bought in the past at Macy&#x27;s.  I don&#x27;t put much on when I use brow pencil, so it&#x27;s not that I used it up by putting alot of color on.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Good product!</li>
    <li> Just the right color for blondes</li>
    <li> Gave 4 stars because shipping was 11 days, product just as described, brand new, correct color. Should have packed in padded envelope, not a box.</li>
    <li> I love the brow liner by Clinique, but two of the three liners sent to me don&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time so I am familiar with how it works. You twist the end to bring up more pencil. On two of them, there is nothing to twist up. It&#x27;s almost as if they were already used and then put back in the boxes and shipped out. :(&lt;br /&gt;Only one of the three I received has any &amp;#34;pencil&amp;#34; in it.</li>
    <li> I have used item this for many years and have tried many others but nothing has been even close to this product! I also used the &#x27;all about lips and it keeps my lipstick from finding lines to run into. Great stuff!!</li>
