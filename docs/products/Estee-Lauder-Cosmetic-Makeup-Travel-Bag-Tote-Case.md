    <li> was a gift, the right color and design for a young adult. received exactly what was stated and pictured</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!!! It&#x27;s big, spacious, shiny, AND it&#x27;s PURPLE!!!xD. I like the snake skin theme on it :). I&#x27;ve been trying to look for a new, decent makeup bag, and this one caught my eye. I lost my old one in a travel luggage this summer with ALL my makeup :(. But alas, I am rising up again. I have halfway filled this with eyeliners, lipsticks, lipgloss, mascara, curling lash, you name it, and there&#x27;s still more room :D. It comes in handy as I used to just put all my makeup in my purse, and that was a bit of trouble :/. Now tho, thanks to this Estee Lauder makeup bag (and you can use it for anything else other than makeup) that came to my likes, I have no trouble at all anymore. I recommend this!</li>
    <li> Love my makeup bag! It&#x27;s small but fits soooo much stuff in it.</li>

    <li> This bag was very stiff.  It&#x27;s very hard to work with. I&#x27;m not going to use this bag. No wonder it was cheap.</li>
    <li> Shiny, and print just like shown in the picture ! A little smaller than I thought, but can hold all of my eye makeup nicely</li>
    <li> No complaints about this Makeup bag. It&#x27;s big enough for travel and it&#x27;s roomy enough for personal sanitation products. It gets the job done, It&#x27;s name brand, It&#x27;s a nice design, and it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not very small, would be good for a larger purse, has a lot of room. It&#x27;s name brand,  practical, affordable and pretty. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> It is so big...i love it! beatiful colors</li>
    <li> Nice to have a purple bag to go with my many purple ensembles.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves purple and this is a very nice trael makeup bag. Just the right size to fit in a handbag.</li>
    <li> i love this bag its perfect i thought it was going to b cheap but it wasnt i hold heavy stuff in it and it does wonderful holding my stuff in</li>
    <li> I purchased the Estee Lauder Purple Makeup and Brush Bag. Such a great cosmetic bag, and I love the color ! Delivery took a little longer than I expected though.</li>
    <li> I like this case. I use it to hold some of my waxing supplies. Plus purple and black are my two favorite colors so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t judge the size, and it was actually bigger than I needed, but that was my fault. I gave it to my daughter who carries one of those huge purses, and she loved it!</li>
    <li> not even close to the picture, but its still cute.</li>
    <li> I choose it because it said purple make up and brush bag. I thought it came with something besides just the bag. Which it does not. There wording is wrong. It is pretty, but I would not have bought it alone like it was. I thought I was getting something else. It is not small , but actually medium size and can fit quite a bit. It came in time  .</li>
    <li> It is large enough to fit all my makeup in.  Will not fit in a small purse as it is a large bag.</li>
    <li> When I looked at the pouch on the site I loved the color and the material. When I received it, I was very happy as it was the same as shown in the picture. I am using this for a couple of weeks now and I am loving it. I actually holds a lot of stuff and stays in its rectangular shape and stands well in my purse. Planning to buy a couple more to give it as gift.</li>
    <li> Its plastic... But it does the job</li>
    <li> love the color and its bigger than it looks i love the color Too!!! Im a name brand lover !</li>

    <li> I purchased this for my 14 year old niece and filled it with Make Up Essentials ....Brush , Eye Shadows , Blush , Lip Gloss , etc. It holds quite a bit , easy to keep clean and attractive . Nice product</li>
    <li> Nice size. Fits all my stuff in it with room to spare. Can find it in my purse with ease. Nice color too. Can&#x27;t go wrong. Go old school with Estée.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t express how much I love the bag! Color,style unique the chicness . I can&#x27;t fit as much make up for a full application. Which includes liquid foundation, blush, eyebrow shadow, lipstick, bronzers, highlighters,concealers, even my eyelash curler and brushes.</li>
