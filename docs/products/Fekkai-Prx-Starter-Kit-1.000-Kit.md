<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These products are incredible. I have dyed, brittle hair that trends to frizz. These helped so much, especially the intensive conditioner. I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I&#x27;m so glad I did. Definitely worth purchasing!</li>
    <li> Before I purchase, I&#x27;d like to know exactly what&#x27;s in this starter kit.  The Description says:  &amp;#34;The PrX Reparatives Collection includes Shampoo, Conditioner, Intense Fortifying Masque, 3 Day Transformation, and Mending Elixir.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The photo shows Shampoo, Conditioner, and Masque.&lt;br /&gt;Can anyone clarify this?</li>
    <li> I love this product. The shampoo and conditioner have a subtle smell of vanilla. It works perfectly to condition my thin hair without making it feel weighted down. My hair is soft and full. The starter kit makes a perfect travel size set. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am 41 with straight, fine, thin hair and getting thinner with age. I am still able to keep my hair past shoulder length. Winter has been very drying on my hair and I recently tried a curly hairdo with a curling iron for the holidays. My hair was so damaged, I was unable to style it for a week until I got this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner are excellent, as other Fekkai products that I have used. But it is the mask that is the bomb! It is absolutely weightless, to the point I use it as a leave-in conditioner. It leaves my hair so soft, supple, and so full of shine. I used to only be able to get that kind of shine with silicon-based heavy, greasy products. It&#x27;s truly unbelievable how smooth my hair is now. Even after just one use, I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to guess that my hair was a dull, dry, nasty, tangled bird&#x27;s nest just prior to using it. Split ends be gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but if this can help anyone else in my situation, I had to rave about it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!! It smells so good I want to eat it!!! I will certainly be buying the full size bottles.</li>
    <li> I love how soft my hair felt after just one application! I have never tried Fekkai products before and clearly  I&#x27;ve been missing out! I will be purchasing all three products after I finish the trial size which these are! :)</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! It makes your hair feel like silk. The conditioner mask made my hair better than before I went to the salon.</li>
    <li> I love Fekkai products.  I love the smell of the product as well as the way my hair behaves.  This product had much more of a nutty tropical smell although not offensive in any way.  Esp since some smells give me headaches.  I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Product came to me used. Very disguising!</li>
    <li> These products are an excellent quality. I enjoy the majority of the others they make as well. I received mine in exchange for my honest review from Influenster &amp; couldn&#x27;t be more please. I have color treated frizzy hair that is a daily battle for me. at least 20 minutes of blow drying per day &amp; thats to combat my frizz. This products reduced that tremendously for me!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair oily. I have fine, curly hair and with or without the conditioner my hair just gets to oily.</li>
    <li> A must for ALL counselors!</li>
    <li> Product arrived in a ripped box and looks used. Not happy at all. Beware. I was afraid the product had been tampered with.</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Living Proof line of product for YEARS.  I love it, but man, it&#x27;s pricey.  When I read the reviews for this product, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  The bottles are tiny.  It is after all, a starter kit.  I wash every other day, and I&#x27;m thinking it will last me a few weeks.  The product itself?  It&#x27;s great!  It works as well as the Living Proof line at a FRACTION of the cost.  Can&#x27;t wait to try the gloss starter kit.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> The conditioner in this kit left my hair really soft. I will definitely buy full-size products.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet.  But I know it will be great.</li>
