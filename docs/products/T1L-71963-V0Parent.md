      <li>My heels are healing nicely.</li>
      <li>First time I used the salve, my feet felt great.  </li>

      <li>I have used many lotions and</li>
      <li>I have tried so many creams for my heals and nothing works like this product.  </li>
      <li>and they are much better.  </li>
      <li>it works but needs to be applied more often than recommended.</li>
      <li>I thought for sure this product would work</li>
      <li>I have tried many creams and lotions on my cracked hands and feet over the years.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to use the MEDICATED salve.</li>
      <li>I love this salve.</li>
      <li>Incorporated it into my massage for 10 years with many happy customers who never felt their feet so soft.</li>
      <li>This is the best product that I have found for dry cracked heels.</li>
      <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely has an underlying odor that would make me not want to put it on and go out, or use it at the office, but it&#x27;s great for treating your heels before bed - put it on and put some thickish socks on over the top to keep it from staining the sheets.</li>
      <li>Works fine.  </li>
      <li>Just fine.</li>
      <li>used everyday helps wonderfully...</li>
      <li>Nice aroma,  very efficient.</li>
      <li>The Gehwol Med Salve for Cracked Skin in by far a superior product.  </li>
      <li>I first came across this product while I lived in The Netherlands and I am so glad that I found it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>however, this stuff is the real deal!!  </li>
      <li>It is pricey, but, for me, it is worth it.</li>
      <li>Generally, the cream is OK.</li>
      <li>AMAZING FOR VERY DRY SKIN</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t do a thing even as I followed the directions exactly.  </li>
      <li>It helped so much!</li>
      <li>I first discovered this at a spa after I had a pedicure.</li>
      <li>I believe you have to use it consistently.</li>
      <li>It really works!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Seeing how rapidly I consumed my first tube and having started on my second, I already re-ordered (2) more tubes of this stuff.</li>
      <li>I first tried it at a spa in Vegas, and I&#x27;m very thankful to them for showing it to me.</li>
      <li>I certainly have put the investment into this salve and I will update this review if I see any progress after applying (4) tubes.</li>
      <li>Very highly recommended to sooth and heal cracked skin on toes, feet, hands.</li>
      <li>Really alleviates the dryness and cracking that can occur on the heels.</li>
      <li>This stuff is absolutely miraculous.  </li>
      <li>and it cools and softens my feet better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them!</li>
      <li>I also use it on my hands, particularly when my cuticles are</li>
      <li>use a tiny tiny bit each day.....absorbs nicely and really works if used regularly.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommend.</li>
      <li>Have used the product for many years and it works for dry feet and dry hands.</li>
      <li>In spite of it &#x27;s &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; smell, it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that really keeps my heels from cracking and being sore.</li>
      <li>It soaks into my hands and feet and leaves them feeling soft.  </li>
      <li>Seeing reviewers say cracks are healed after 3 days of use is complete fallacy.</li>
      <li>- because my feet get so soft I think \\&quot;oh</li>
      <li>I really have used less than 15% of the tube, because it is too greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than less greasy creams.</li>
      <li>but I just use it at night and put on some socks - no mess at all.</li>
      <li>such which mainly just mask the problem....</li>
      <li>This product works as no other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>With regular use it leaves your heals and callouses as soft as a baby&#x27;s tush.  </li>
      <li>But it is very thick and greasy, with a strong smell.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve not seen improvement even in the slightly dry spots around my foot nor have I seen any improvement in my slightly calloused right heel.</li>

<li> I usually use it before bed, and there is no way to apply it without then washing your hands.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s hard to do once you&#x27;ve put the thick grease on your feet.</li>
<li> I woke up in the middle of the night, crazy with itch.  </li>
<li> I still need to put it on every day, I put it on after I shower at night, but no more cracked skin!</li>

    <li> This is the best foot cream I have ever found.  Incorporated it into my massage for 10 years with many happy customers who never felt their feet so soft. HIGHLY recommend.</li>
    <li> Saves my dry cracked hands and feet.  Best thing for over- washed hands and cracked heels</li>
    <li> This is the best product that I have found for dry cracked heels.</li>
    <li> I have suffered with dry cracked and just nasty feet for years. This product is a miracle! I saw results in days and no longer have shameful feet!</li>
    <li> In spite of it &#x27;s &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; smell, it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that really keeps my heels from cracking and being sore.</li>
    <li> Does what it advertize</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely miraculous.  Two to three days and those bothersome cracks are gone.  And it doesn&#x27;t stain one&#x27;s sheets.</li>
    <li> It really works!  Cleared up the cracks in my heels in just a few days.  All the Gehwol products are great</li>
    <li> This is the only product that I have found that actually heals cracked feet!!!  I have used many lotions and such which mainly just mask the problem....however, this stuff is the real deal!!  When my feet are bad as long as I use it every couple of days, then I have no problems.  Once I stop though - because my feet get so soft I think \\&quot;oh I don&#x27;t need it\\&quot; - then after about a month or so...problems start again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is greasy...but I just use it at night and put on some socks - no mess at all.</li>
    <li> Works well for my dry cracked feet!</li>
    <li> It is one of the best healing creams I&#x27;ve ever used&lt;br /&gt;the price I got it for was very good.</li>
    <li> Really alleviates the dryness and cracking that can occur on the heels. Last a long time too</li>
    <li> Wish I knew about this stuff a long time ago! Add  a pair of aloe socks and a pumice to your cart.</li>
    <li> It is the best cream I have ever tried.  After five years of cracks, they are almost healed. I started seeing results in a week.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product</li>
    <li> First time I used the salve, my feet felt great.  I had cracked heels and it was just a matter of time that they would start to hurt.  My heels are healing nicely.</li>
    <li> My heels were badly cracked and painful.  Within a few days they had improved enough that I could walk without noticing the soreness.  I had tried a lot of products before this one and it is the best.</li>
    <li> Excelent cream for the feet</li>
    <li> Wonderful cream. Nice aroma,  very efficient.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s excellent! the best i ever used!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many foot creams for my feet. I have very dry, dry heels. It doesn&#x27;t help that I like to wear flip-flops all summer. I need to constantly put lotion on my feet or else the skin on my heels will crack. This is the only cream that has stopped the cracking! I still need to put it on every day, I put it on after I shower at night, but no more cracked skin! And you only have to use a little bit each time so a tube lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> works great on cracked heels</li>
    <li> I first came across this product while I lived in The Netherlands and I am so glad that I found it on Amazon.  It is incredible on cracked skin on the soles of your feet.  You have to try this cream.  It is unbelievable.  With regular use it leaves your heals and callouses as soft as a baby&#x27;s tush.  Just scrape your feet with a foot scraper and put on a quarter size amount.  Put on cotton socks and you will see the difference.  Use before bed and after your shower if you wear socks.  It is pricey, but, for me, it is worth it. This cream does not have paraffin, which is a good thing.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many creams for my heals and nothing works like this product.  I put this on at night with some white sox and wake up and they are much better.  I have also used it on my hands--antibacterial soap wreaks havoc on the palms of my hands.  The Gehwol Salve for cracked skin is WONDERFUL.</li>
    <li> I do not understand the good reviews, this product does nothing to me.</li>
    <li> used everyday helps wonderfully...the tube lasts forever...use a tiny tiny bit each day.....absorbs nicely and really works if used regularly.</li>
    <li> I have no idea why this product works so well, but it does. I first tried it at a spa in Vegas, and I&#x27;m very thankful to them for showing it to me. My heels have never been softer than when I use this. I also use it on my hands, particularly when my cuticles are dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely has an underlying odor that would make me not want to put it on and go out, or use it at the office, but it&#x27;s great for treating your heels before bed - put it on and put some thickish socks on over the top to keep it from staining the sheets.</li>
    <li> This product works as no other I&#x27;ve tried. Very highly recommended to sooth and heal cracked skin on toes, feet, hands. Very impressed.</li>
    <li> Best cream for your feet ever!</li>
    <li> I thought for sure this product would work but it didn&#x27;t do a thing even as I followed the directions exactly.  Wouldn&#x27;t order this again.  It smells weird also.</li>
    <li> Have used the product for many years and it works for dry feet and dry hands.</li>
    <li> It helped so much! Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this salve. If you have dry, cracked heels (and who doesn&#x27;t in the summer as a result of wearing sandals?), this will soften them within just a few days.  I also have a callous along the ball of my foot near my big toe that can become cracked and painful.  This salve not only provides relief but also helps prevent future cracks.I keep a tube on my bedside table and apply the salve after I crawl into bed.  I don&#x27;t even wear socks. I first discovered this at a spa after I had a pedicure. The girl recommend it , and I&#x27;ve been a fan since. A strange sidenote:  I walked through a backyard in sandals earlier in the summer and ended up with almost 20 itchy bites on both feet.  I woke up in the middle of the night, crazy with itch.  I tried 2 different topical products I had on hand that did nothing to relieve the itch.  In desperation I grabbed my tube of Gehwol and rubbed the salve all over the bites.  Within a few minutes the itch was gone. Be sure to use the MEDICATED salve.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product. Generally, the cream is OK. But it is very thick and greasy, with a strong smell. I usually use it before bed, and there is no way to apply it without then washing your hands. That&#x27;s hard to do once you&#x27;ve put the thick grease on your feet. So, for that reason, I find I don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/18/14: I&#x27;ve had this cream for almost 6 months. I really have used less than 15% of the tube, because it is too greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than less greasy creams. But now the tube is leaking from the end where it is crimped closed. If I try to squeeze cream from the mouth of the tube, it also squeezes out the other side. This has rendered the tube virtually useless, unless I want to clean it every time I use it. I&#x27;ve downgraded from 2 to 1 star.</li>
    <li> A good product but not the best I ever used (which no longer is available) but I have very dry cracked hands in winter...it works but needs to be applied more often than recommended.</li>
    <li> The Jury&#x27;s out on this product. Seeing reviewers say cracks are healed after 3 days of use is complete fallacy. I finished one tube of 2.6 oz and now on my second tube. I have not seen any definable improvement at all :/&lt;br /&gt;Granted my left heel is quite calloused and cracked but I&#x27;ve not seen improvement even in the slightly dry spots around my foot nor have I seen any improvement in my slightly calloused right heel. This is after constant evening applications of working the product into my heels and feet for several minute each side and then carefully covering with a sock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing how rapidly I consumed my first tube and having started on my second, I already re-ordered (2) more tubes of this stuff. I certainly have put the investment into this salve and I will update this review if I see any progress after applying (4) tubes. Of course, if I do not see any progress, I will adjust this review as well.</li>
    <li> I have tried many creams and lotions on my cracked hands and feet over the years.  Nothing seem to make a difference as soon as it soaked in.  The Gehwol Med Salve for Cracked Skin in by far a superior product.  It soaks into my hands and feet and leaves them feeling soft.  It helps prevents the skin from cracking open. A bonus id it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> Works fine.  Just fine.</li>
    <li> This foot cream is very good.I recommend this product, and will order it again and again.</li>
    <li> AMAZING FOR VERY DRY SKIN</li>
    <li> Very good A++++ seler</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my brother. It seems to help with his cracked heels. He is putting the cream every night after shower before he goes to bed. It&#x27;s not a miracle so it won&#x27;t treat the crack after one time use over night. I believe you have to use it consistently. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> This cream works great on cracked heels.  Put some on before bedtime and put on some socks and you will notice a great improvement.</li>
    <li> My hands and feet have been affected by Hand and Food Syndrome because of chemotherapy. My doctor&#x27;s office gave me a sample of this to try...and it cools and softens my feet better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them! It is an ointment...pretty greasy...but if you wear socks (I use it on my hands and feet) to protect your sheets (I use it at bedtime), not a problem. It may seem a bit expensive, but it is worth it, I promise.</li>
</ol>
