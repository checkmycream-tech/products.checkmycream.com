      <li>Honestly it&#x27;s another home run product for the H2Ocean brand.</li>

      <li>Does a very good job in promoting the healing of your new tattoo.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and goes on great and even though it came highly recommended, it did not work out for me.</li>
      <li>I love H2Ocean, Everyone should use this product in their healing process.</li>
      <li>However this cream is my favorite.</li>
      <li>These products are used by millions of people so they are a better guarantee than this niche product.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>This stuff does do a better job at keeping the skin moist for longer though</li>
      <li>but I peeled a lot more than with the H2Ocean.</li>
      <li>I love H2Ocean products.  </li>
      <li>not so sure yet,&lt;br /&gt;as</li>
      <li>but I like tattoo goo better</li>
      <li>I love H2Ocean.</li>
      <li>Absolutley love this stuff for my tattoos.</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this product I used it on my tattoo</li>
      <li>More than in the tube to help keep my tattoos moisturized.</li>
      <li>This lotion is my favorite for tattoo after care.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years.</li>
      <li>so I can throw this in my purse when I need to add more throughout the day.</li>
      <li>If you like the thickness (Think Eucerin) than I&#x27;m sure you would be okay with this product.</li>
      <li>Great for new tattoos</li>
      <li>I have been getting covered in tattoos for over 20 years now and this is by far the best product to put on your fresh tattoos.  </li>
      <li>so I really wasn&#x27;t sure how well it&#x27;d just compare, but it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
      <li>feels good on the touch, isn&#x27;t oily or messy and moisturizers beautifully.</li>
      <li>I used A &amp; D ointment, mostly because it was cheap and available.</li>
      <li>It absorbs very quickly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I very quickly decided against this product.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also easy to travel with</li>
      <li>I have numerous tattoos all of which are beautifully done</li>
      <li>This was the first time using any kind of &amp;#34;fancy product&amp;#34;  to care for my tattoo.  </li>
      <li>This is a great lotion to use after the initial two or three days of healing have passed.</li>
      <li>I like this cream because not that it is only moisturizing, it helps my tattoo looking great.  </li>
      <li>use this during tattoo healing and liked it so much still using</li>
      <li>It soaks in so smoothly and it doesn&#x27;t catch on to the scabbing.</li>
      <li>Good stuff, will definitely be buying more.</li>
      <li>i used A&amp;D all the time, but when i bought this and used it, my remaining of A&amp;D is going straight to the trash..!!!</li>
      <li>Using the foam soap and washing 4 times a day, followed by applying the Aquatat ointment after washing the first two days, then using this Ocean Care lotion for day three and onward, my tattoos heal faster, and look better than what I have ever seen before.</li>
      <li>Stops the itching when it happens, creates a nice barrier to help keep the ink inside, and it seems to be healing up faster than just normal A&amp;D cream.</li>
      <li>and I feel this product can help in some situations beyond a tattoo (clean hydration of skin).</li>
      <li>In fact, since I don&#x27;t need much of the cream at all I&#x27;ve been using it a bit on my winter-dry hands :)</li>
      <li>Not a bad product</li>
      <li>RIGHT away I noticed a huge difference.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best tattoo aftercare I&#x27;ve found on the market to date.</li>
    <li> I bought this to add to the aftercare kit.  It&#x27;s the healing salve which if you heal like I did, I have about 3/4 left and it took care of a tattoo that covers my shoulder joint. It&#x27;s a great product that I now stand behind after using it on my first tattoo.  Check them out on their main website, just google h20cean and you&#x27;ll find your way.  It&#x27;s worth the money when you&#x27;re talking about body art that lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used H2Ocean for quite a bit of my tattoo work, and it&#x27;s the best after-care product I&#x27;ve found.  It isn&#x27;t greasy, it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing, it has a pleasant scent, and I don&#x27;t experience any itching. I&#x27;m glad that my tattoo artist, Tim Herbert, recommended it to me!</li>
    <li> Worked good but when it arrived it was already more than half emty...i expected a new full tube</li>
    <li> A note:  many people with ink will agree that there is a huge debate over the very best regimen and a lot of the time it comes down to your personal preference which is paramount so long as you are using a quality product.  You may not have any issues due to your skin type, area tattooed, et cetera, in other words, \\&quot;Your mileage may vary\\&quot; considerably.    I truly did not care for this product.  I live in the desert where it&#x27;s always hot and the air is always dry, we have very low humidity which only exacerbates the problem of your tattoo drying out.  I tried H2Ocean side by side with [[ASIN:B002T5ARNO Aquaphor Healing Ointment, 14 Oz]] on my tattoo, from the back of my left leg (just above the knee) to my natural waistline.  I very quickly decided against this product.  I tried to be fair and equal, using H2Ocean and Aquaphor on similar skin.  As the inside of the thigh and the back of the leg are very sensitive and thinner skin I tried to make sure I wasn&#x27;t basing my conclusions on using one product on thicker tougher skin than the other.      With H2Ocean following a regimen of three showers a day and an additional washing of the tattooed area followed by a thin coat of both I found myself having to apply double the H2Ocean than [[ASIN:B002T5ARNO Aquaphor Healing Ointment, 14 Oz]].  This is very expensive when you compare the cost of both products and the total area being tattooed (I&#x27;m getting a 3/4 body tattoo).  In addition to the cost and having to stop and clean then apply H2Ocean more frequently I noticed a massive problem with drying out, this resulted in that irritating itching and the urge to scratch.  I had none of this with my alternative unless it was in the morning when I just woke up which is to be expected.      I stopped using H2Ocean pretty quickly because of these issues, it just wasn&#x27;t worth the possible (additional) touchups to continue testing the product.  I didn&#x27;t notice an improvement in color or healing though it was less sticky.  It didn&#x27;tleave my skin as smooth and soft either.  Frankly I don&#x27;t think that (the stick and grease factor) is a big plus when ultimately we&#x27;re all trying to get the best heal and the least hassle from our aftercare routine.</li>
    <li> H2Ocean is the only lotion I will use for my tattoos! It helps the tattoo heal, relieves itching, and smells great!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
    <li> Having a number of differnt tattoos from back to all over arms, and living in a DRY, AZ, DRY climate id say just based on ease of application, lack of fragrance,  and how it feels going on to a fresh 3/4 forearm sleeve this is superior to A+D/Tattoo Goo, that ive used in the past, I also have Cats so the less attraction of hair on it the better! I didnt pay for mine so, at the end of the day only change from what you&#x27;re using if you have an issue!</li>
    <li> I have always been a big fan of H2Ocean products. The tattoos cream works very well. It seems to heal quicker and it helps fight the itching.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does a very good job in promoting the healing of your new tattoo. I would have given it 5 stars if there was just a little bit more lotion in the tube, granted I probably used too much. *a little goes a long way*</li>
    <li> I only have one tattoo and do not want anymore but the guy who did mine gave me this to put on as put of my aftercare routine. I loved it! People were telling me about the itching the scabs and the tenderness and experienced none of this. As a matter of fact my tat is on my back right below my neck and I for it in 2005, it still is so vibrate and looks fresh. I got compliments on how it looked from the beginning since my colors never faded. I had some left over and gave it to a friend. She loved it too.</li>
    <li> This lotion is my favorite for tattoo after care. It protects the skin and it helps prevent the fresh tattoo from drying out, which can crack your ink. I would recommend this lotion for anyone that gets a tattoo and want to take care of it.</li>
    <li> I personally wouldn&#x27;t use this. If you are unsure what to use for tattoo aftercare:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1-3: Wash tattoo lightly with a cleanser or antibacterial soap 3-4 times a day, then apply thin layer of Aquafor&lt;br /&gt;Day 4 until it heals completely: Wash once a day with cleanser/soap, then apply Cetaphil throughout the day to keep moisturized (not too much though)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is ALL you need to do. These products are used by millions of people so they are a better guarantee than this niche product. Don&#x27;t risk an adverse reaction on your new tattoo by using relatively unknown, untested products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aquaphor: http://www.amazon.com/Aquaphor-Healing-Ointment-Irritated-Protectant/dp/B006IB5T4W/&lt;br /&gt;Cetaphil: http://www.amazon.com/Cetaphil-Moisturizing-Sensitive-Fragrance-Non-comedogenic/dp/B00113HNB4/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Source: Many tattoos healed perfectly between girlfriend &amp; I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRUST ME</li>
    <li> I have used almost every aftercare product you can think of, from A&amp;D to Black Cat, and this is by far the best I have found. No sting, not greasy or oily, and it seems to have cut down the healing time, to next to nothing. I highly recommend this product to anyone with a new tattoo.</li>
    <li> I started to use this right as my tattoo was in the last stage of healing and beginning to peel and itch. This has by far helped the healing process and keeping it moisturized without fading the color.</li>
    <li> This works great for tattoos.  It heals within 5 days.  The tattoo keeps its color really well.</li>
    <li> H2Ocean is always the best!!!  I tried Tattoo goo and went back to H2Ocean.</li>
    <li> H2Ocean Ocean Care Tattoo Aftercare Lotion is my son&#x27;s product of choice for his after tattoo care.  I have also used this product for special attention to dry skin patches.  I have also used this product on my face with no problems, and I have sensitive skin.  Our family recommends this product, has been using it for about 2 years, and will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> I have multiple tattoos and first used H2Ocean after getting a partial sleeve on my arm.  I was very impressed with how this product worked.   Never really had much of a problem with scabbing, but when I started on my sleeve had some issues.  After using this product after the first session never had another problem again.  After using lotion the first few tattoos I like how this rubs in and doesn&#x27;t feel goopy.  Just stays moist and heals perfect.</li>
    <li> My favortie prodcuts for tattoos and peircings. I love H2Ocean, Everyone should use this product in their healing process. works the best.</li>
    <li> Does not live up to expectations. I used Tattoo Majik before this on the inside of my right arm.......SAME exact tattoo on the left inside....on the right side....NO scabbing at all.....the left side (H2Ocean) scabbed up.....I do not recommend this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I love H2Ocean products.  The tattoo aftercare is not too greasy.  I&#x27;ve used Tattoo Goo before and did not like the thick film it left on my tattoos.  H2Ocean keeps it moist but not greasy or sticky.</li>
    <li> I just got my most recent ink done over Memorial Day weekend and used the H2Ocean aftercare kit (soap, lotion and foam) according to the instructions. All I can say is that this tattoo is already almost healed and I did not have issues with scabbing, color fade/loss and even oozing as I did in the past with regular body lotions and A&amp;D ointment. Everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different so any one product is not going to be great for every person who tries it, but I will never use anything other than H2Ocean products in the future because it works for me.</li>
    <li> I am officially an &amp;#34;ink addict&amp;#34; and this cream works great! More than in the tube to help keep my tattoos moisturized.</li>
    <li> As I write this it&#x27;s been 3 days since I got some script on the inside of my wrist.  I&#x27;ve been using H2Ocean since day 1 and I love it!  It&#x27;s not at all greasy, not even a little bit like some lotions that claim to be non-greasy.  It absorbs very quickly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have not had a single itch!  Since it&#x27;s script, there&#x27;s only some light scabbing in really thin lines.  The cream keeps them moist enough that I haven&#x27;t had any peeling and the few scabs there are, are almost gone without ever getting flaky.  But mostly I&#x27;m just amazed at the fact that I haven&#x27;t had any itching, and I have VERY dry skin normally.  In fact, since I don&#x27;t need much of the cream at all I&#x27;ve been using it a bit on my winter-dry hands :)</li>
    <li> I am currently using this product on a fresh tattoo and all I can say is wow! It helped me heal faster, and it did help a little with the soreness that comes after the tattoo a few days later. I would give 5 stars, but, it seems like the moisturizer and foam don&#x27;t hydrate too well? I may be wrong, but it does make my skin feel tight.. not dry, but tight. Other than that, I will use this product on every other tattoo I get!</li>
    <li> I like this cream because not that it is only moisturizing, it helps my tattoo looking great.  I can apply whenever it is needed.  It is a good way of taking care of your tattoo!</li>
    <li> I used to use H2Ocean stuff for my piercings when I was younger. I haven&#x27;t gotten a tattoo in almost a decade but I decided to go big and I started off thinking I could get away with some stuff that I had that was formulated for sensitive skin. After a couple days I learned that H2Ocean had a line for tattoos and that they were well reviewed so I decided to hit up my shop (let&#x27;s face it, I get it a LOT cheaper at my shop which was a surprise because usually Amazon is cheaper). I bought this cream and the foaming soap and RIGHT away I noticed a huge difference. The swelling and pain quickly died down, my tattoo gets cleaner because the soap powers through residue and bacteria. However this cream is my favorite. It glides on SO much smoother than other lotions so it doesn&#x27;t irritate the tender skin of my tattoo. It soaks in so smoothly and it doesn&#x27;t catch on to the scabbing. Plus, you don&#x27;t need a lot of this stuff. I use about a dime size for the large tattoo inside my forearm. My skin feels soft and smooth and it looks healthy. My tattoo looks better and I can already tell that it&#x27;s starting to heal better and quicker. It&#x27;s also easy to travel with so I can throw this in my purse when I need to add more throughout the day.</li>
    <li> it may cost a bit more, but it cuts your healing time in half.. i got my hole leg from the knee down tattooed, the foam is easier to apply to a swollen tattoo, so id start with the h2o foam if yur covering a large area. but once it starts to flake and heal id switch to the cream. my whole leg flaked off within a week using this stuff, and its all natural too, its great stuff and worth the extra 6 bucks....</li>
    <li> Excellent after care tattoo product, however I would stay away from the tattoo kit. I had bad luck with the tattoo kit. I was getting irritation around the tattoo when I purchased the kit.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product that has worked very well for me in the past &amp; I won&#x27;t use any other lotion . And it got here pretty quickly</li>
    <li> Great after care cream!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years. Love the product! Tattoos heal very fast and stay true to color.</li>
    <li> I ended up being allergic to this, having spot tested it on other skin that was not tattooed and breaking out in a red rash and scratching like crazy as well. Also, it has parabens and other chemicals which would make it very unnatural IMO. It smells nice and goes on great and even though it came highly recommended, it did not work out for me. If you have sensitive skin, STAY AWAY.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product I used it on my tattoo once I got it touched up and it had quite a few scabs and it took care of them in about 3-4 days and I highly recommend this</li>
    <li> great product.  I&#x27;ve used it say 1-2 weeks post.  For immediate application after getting the tattoo I&#x27;d prefer the foam since it spreads easier with less resistance.</li>
    <li> I love H2Ocean. I&#x27;ve tried others but this worked GREAT on my tattoo. It kept my tattoo looking and feeling awesome! I even use it for my face because theres not any harsh stuff in it :)</li>
    <li> Best stuff you can get for tattoo healing and it&#x27;s not greasy , I&#x27;m covered in tattoos and it&#x27;s all I use expensive but worth it</li>
    <li> I recently finished a half sleeve and wanted to ensure the colors pop. I looked for one that wouldn&#x27;t clog my pores and found this winner. The lotion goes on thick and helps keep your skin moist for hours without being greasy like a lot of others that use coconut oils. I cannot recommend it higher.</li>
    <li> i used A&amp;D all the time, but when i bought this and used it, my remaining of A&amp;D is going straight to the trash..!!! love how it go in the skin in just seconds, and make the tattoo spot soft and smooth all day, no itching  ,and also improve the color of my old tattoo</li>
    <li> I am now a believer. After getting a major piece done, this stuff absolutely saved me. Quickens the healing time, limits nearly if not all scabbing (I didn&#x27;t at all for a large detailed rich tattoo), feels good on the touch, isn&#x27;t oily or messy and moisturizers beautifully. It will be my go to any and all future tattoos.</li>
    <li> Makes my tattoo look like new.</li>
    <li> I used this as it was recommended as the best product to use on new tattoos. I carefully practiced all follow-up care and instructions. What I experienced was extraordinary scabbing, excessive redness, abnormal pain, apparent puss oozing infection, abundant itching, and near obliteration of two tattoos after they finally healed - requiring extreme touch-ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tattoos were topnotch and truly incredible. It was heartbreaking to see the final result after they had healed. Thankfully, due to a very skilled tattoo artist, both tattoos were restored to nearly the same state they were in when first inked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon subsequent tattoos, I repeated the recommended follow-up care but with one exception - I did not use H2Ocean Ocean Care Tattoo Aftercare cream. What I did use was Udderly Smooth Body Cream (Udder Cream - Greaseless - Stainless, lightly scented) which had been given to me to use on a severe radiation burn resulting from cancer \\&quot;treatment.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the Udderly Smooth cream resulted in a tattoo that healed with NONE of the above listed complications. The tattoos healed quickly and cleanly, with little to next-to-no need for touchups. Udderly Smooth is what I will use on all future tattoos and I recommend it to anyone who has had similar adverse affects from H2Ocean Ocean Care Tattoo Aftercare.</li>
    <li> H2Ocean products really are the best for tattoo aftercare.  This is create to keep the moisture in your tattoo right after it&#x27;s healing, but also as upkeep to keep the tattoo fresh.  My husband has used it for all 3 of his very large tattoos and I used it on mine, too.  I&#x27;d recommend this product line to anyone looking for great tattoo products.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product but i find my skin moisturized longer using standard lubriderm than this lotion</li>
    <li> Works awesome for tattoos to keep them moisturized.  I am still using it even though my tattoo is healed.  I will buy again for future tattoos.</li>
    <li> I got this as an add-on. Didn&#x27;t really care for it. It was thick and didn&#x27;t really feel like it helped my tattoo stay moisturized. Should have just used Aquaphor, and saved a few bucks.</li>
    <li> I currently have 6 tattoos, two large ones on my back, one on my hip, one medium sized one on my arm and two smaller ones on my wrists.  The large one on my back (my first tattoo) I did not apply anything to, which I regret. It&#x27;s a beautiful piece of artwork, and the colors have faded much faster than they should have. *Just a warning for those who are wanting their first tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my second I used A &amp; D ointment, mostly because it was cheap and available. I HATE the feeling of putting this on, because quite frankly a new tattoo is tender and you really have to rub the ointment on. Next tattoo, I used Vaseline, with the same texture as A &amp; D ointment. Mind you, this tattoo is just above my elbow, and got over ALL my clothing. Next tattoo, it was Lubraderm lotion. I don&#x27;t know about you all, but putting that lotion on a new tattoo (with fresh wounds) STINGS LIKE HECK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, and thankfully, I was recommended H20cean. What an amazing relief. I had no pain when I first applied it to the tattoo on my left wrist, as well as the one on my hip. Both of these tattoos are my only colored tattoos, and this lotion preserved the colors and made them pop. It isn&#x27;t messy, and I had no problem rubbing it in when the tattoo was new or scabbing. They are a bit more expensive at tattoo shops, so I suggest purchasing it here before you go and get your tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard that some people have problems with stinging, but like I said before, I had problems with other lotions, and this one was gentle on my new artwork.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion to use after the initial two or three days of healing have passed. I still find Aquaphor to be my best bet right after being tattooed, but I switch to this as the peeling regresses. It&#x27;s also less messy, of course, since it is not petroleum-based, and takes the edge of any itching.</li>
    <li> I have been getting covered in tattoos for over 20 years now and this is by far the best product to put on your fresh tattoos.  It isn&#x27;t greasy like all of the petroleum products out there and keeps your skin moist for hours and hours without sticking to your clothing.  I very highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Since finding H2Ocean tattoo after care products, I won&#x27;t use anything else. Using the foam soap and washing 4 times a day, followed by applying the Aquatat ointment after washing the first two days, then using this Ocean Care lotion for day three and onward, my tattoos heal faster, and look better than what I have ever seen before. Using these products my tattoos have been completely healed in 5 days! Amazing products!</li>
    <li> I work in healthcare and I feel this product can help in some situations beyond a tattoo (clean hydration of skin). But in terms of my pecs piece it was awesome! nice color a year later</li>
    <li> You know how fresh ink gets itchy? Solves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know how lotions are oily? It isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Know how A&amp;D creme sticks around and can make a mess? It doesn&#x27;t, as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time using it so I really wasn&#x27;t sure how well it&#x27;d just compare, but it&#x27;s good stuff. Stops the itching when it happens, creates a nice barrier to help keep the ink inside, and it seems to be healing up faster than just normal A&amp;D cream. Good stuff, will definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect cream for after care for your tattoo.  The same company makes an ointment and it seems to clog the poors if you use to much causing a &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; rash on the skin.  This cream however is great.</li>
    <li> This totally helped my tattoo during the healing process. Adds moisture without clogging the pores. I use this stuff on any dry skin spot I have and it&#x27;s fantastic!!! A++ quality product!!!!</li>
    <li> Got this stuff to try after having great success with Aquatat. It works well as a general moisturizer but I found it did not live up to the performance of Aquatat for fresh ink. This stuff does do a better job at keeping the skin moist for longer though so it is more suited to being used after the initial &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; healing period.</li>
    <li> Great product. My tattoos seemed pretty well healed up in a week.  Love that there is no strong scent.</li>
    <li> The best care for tattoos I have ever used. I always recommend this product to all my friends that get new ink. Shipped fast and price was reasonable.</li>
    <li> This actually dried out my tattoo and made me itch more than I&#x27;d like. I&#x27;d prefer the ointment over this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> The tube that I got had a broken seal/seam at the top of it and it was leaking in the box, but I kept it because it was a small amount that had leaked. I ended up giving this tube away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My rating is based on consistency. This goes on more like an ointment than a lotion or even cream, meaning it&#x27;s very thick feeling. I typically use Lubriderm for all of my tattoo needs, but my most recent tattoo ventured into my arm pit and with the way I move my arms I needed some extra skin protection during healing due to all of the rubbing of skin with arm movement. I couldn&#x27;t stand this stuff so I stuck with the Lubriderm and Tattoo Goo even though I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the goo. If you like the thickness (Think Eucerin) than I&#x27;m sure you would be okay with this product.</li>
    <li> Using this with a new foot tattoo. This was recommend by my artist and it seems to be keeping my tattoo moisturizerized.</li>
    <li> Absolutley love this stuff for my tattoos. It helps them heal perfectly.</li>
    <li> use this during tattoo healing and liked it so much still using</li>
    <li> -I gave this product 5 stars due to the fact that it does exactly what it says. Protects the new tattoo while it heals.&lt;br /&gt;No sticky feeling. This cream goes on smooth and will not cause clothing to cling to your new tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I have tried several other product such as your standard bacitracin ointment and the foam version of the H2Ocean.&lt;br /&gt;The ointment sticks to your clothing. The foam H2Ocean caused skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I have used H2Ocean (no-foam version) for over a year and will NEVER use any other product for my new tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;This product far exceeds my experiences with other products I have tried over the years.</li>
    <li> This H2Ocean tattoo after care is better than anything I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Found out about this product a while ago. Honestly it&#x27;s another home run product for the H2Ocean brand. I&#x27;ve never had anything but great stuff come from H2Ocean. I&#x27;m the marketing manager for www.stapaw.com (Support Tattoos and Piercings at Work).</li>
    <li> in my opinion, this is the best tattoo aftercare product on the market. it was introduced to me by a shop in georgia 4 years ago and have used it on the 30 hours of ink i&#x27;ve accumulated since. absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I got the whole kit after a very lengthy and expensive tattoo.  This was the first time using any kind of &amp;#34;fancy product&amp;#34;  to care for my tattoo.  I have numerous tattoos all of which are beautifully done and I get complimented numerous times daily on them and this is not an exaggeration.  I used this product and broke out on the entire forearm of which the piece was done and the product was used and developed a terrible rash that has not gone away after two weeks now. I have NEVER had a single problem caring for any of my tattoos nor have I ever had a problem with any other method of aftercare. I used this product and for the first time ever since I got my first tattoo 20 years ago I have had a terrible reaction. All I can say is as far as aftercare goes, if it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it. I take very good care of my skin, I don&#x27;t have jacked up work done out of a garage by some bum, I don&#x27;t even sit in the sun and after using this product line my skin is a DISASTER!  the review doesn’t do any justice, I wish I could post pictures so you could see that I&#x27;m not just a disgruntled individual because I was given the box set of after care products for FREE so I&#x27;m not even out the money on this one, just hate to see someone make the mistake of using a product that paid to be a part of an association and has had a lot of speculation around them and their products have been harmful</li>
    <li> Have always loved this stuff for my tattoos. My grandfather sells it at his shop and he started me on it. Works great!</li>
    <li> Works great and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> The Jury is out on this, I have been using it and I&#x27;m not sure If I like it yet or not, It seems to prolong my healing time, so not so sure yet,&lt;br /&gt;as for the product itself, it apply&#x27;s nicely, its non greasy, I can&#x27;t complain about it, but I cant rave about it either.</li>
    <li> Best tattoo moisturizing cream. I&#x27;ve tried aveeno but I peeled a lot more than with the H2Ocean. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve Used This Product Before And It Is Much Cheaper Through Amazon.  It Works Great For New Tattoo&#x27;s.  I Highly Recommend This Product.</li>
    <li> This really helped reduce the inflammation and dryness on my face during and after a bad acne flare up.</li>
    <li> Other than the smell I do really like that its thick, and its a great face lotion. However it didnt do much of anything for my healing tattoos. Their piercing spray is awesome but I dont like the tattoo lotion too much.</li>
    <li> This thing helped heal my.tatto twice as fast as the guy said it would take. Doesn&#x27;t have overwhelming scent and keeps tatto moist longer than usual.</li>
    <li> I like this but I like tattoo goo better this stuff is too thick</li>
    <li> Use this with all my tattoos.  Helps them heal and it isn&#x27;t oily</li>
    <li> Use only to shine up an already healed tattoo. If you use this product as aftercare to heal a tattoo, you are asking for trouble. You have been warned.</li>
    <li> This is a good lotion. I have used many in the past but this one seems to help more with the itch and it absorbs really well. It doesn&#x27;t smell like a hospital and doesn&#x27;t stick to my shirts, so I like it. It would get 5 stars but it is expensive.</li>
    <li> bought this for my boyfriend so he could care for his tattoo, he was using vaseline so it was sticky and just all over his clothes (yuck!) he says its awesome :D i was surprised to see it was alot like lotion i kept thinking it was gonna be like a gel for some reason haha but i put it on him the other day and it was obsorbed right away. if u want something to care for ur tattoo that doesnt get all over the place buy this, he also said it helped with the itching.. btw for some reason i thought it was kind of small when i saw it, but seeing that u only need a little bit (his tattoo is pretty big, takes up his whole inner upper arm whatever haha and only needs about a dime size of h2ocean for the whole thing) it should last a long time and serve for alot of tattoos (:</li>
    <li> Product works great and last a long time.... Great for new tattoos</li>
    <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve used yet.</li>
    <li> This is amazing for tattoos and dry skin. You seriously can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff, and I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
