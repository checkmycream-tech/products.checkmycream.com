      <li>Not only does my breath smell good</li>
      <li>good buy at your local store</li>
      <li>My mouth is so fresh and so clean clean.</li>
      <li>My mouth is clean and minty fresh.</li>
      <li>I did tons of research into what was the best mouthwash for tartar control, various medical and dental websites, Listerine Coolmint was the consensus.</li>
      <li>A classic product that will always be a favorite.</li>
      <li>There is something about that cool fresh feeling that makes you feel like you can tackle your day.</li>
      <li>The original formula most certainly has that antiseptic taste while the Citrus flavor doesn&#x27;t really do anything but taste</li>
      <li>I like minty fresh breath it gives.</li>
      <li>Leaves my mouth feeling fresh for  while after each use.</li>
      <li>and i get that confidence to talk and laugh just the way i like it.</li>
      <li>Out of all of the flavors of listerine, this is by far our favorite.</li>
      <li>My breathe smells like a fresh mints using before and after brushing my teeth.</li>
      <li>Sometimes after brushing my teeth, I didn&#x27;t really know why I still feel that my mouth isn&#x27;t clean</li>
      <li>For college kids and newly single folks, Listerine is an absolute must have for making members of your preferred gender stick around and feel good about their mouths.</li>
      <li>For me this is the &#x27;original&#x27;; people older than me might remember the amber colored stuff.</li>
      <li>This was recommended by our dentists and we like it very much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of alternative mouth washes, essential oils and herbal preparations including neem oil, and nothing works like Listerine to control plaque and safely keep mouth germs at bay.</li>
      <li>According to my dentist I have almost no tartar or plaque and need only a light dental cleaning every 6 months!  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>Restorative dentist says I don&#x27;t need scaling an root planing, though with so many crowns I work hard to keep my gums healthy.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t just let it stand there, swish it around and make sure every single surface of your mouth is covered.</li>
      <li>Cool Mint Listerine is a big, shining, bright green reset button for your mouth.</li>
      <li>Great size to last a few months.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>Name brand quality at economic prices.</li>
      <li>You can never have too much Listerine.</li>
      <li>You just gargle this for a few seconds and your breath will be fresh for most of the day.</li>
      <li>taste great, leaves mouth feeling fresh and new and ready to tackle more crap that i eat.</li>
      <li>(And, speaking from experience, do yourself the favor and save your money on the original Listerine formula - the yellow version - and the Citrus version.  </li>
      <li>If you are an adult with receding gums (which is common) you would be better off with an alcohol free version.</li>
      <li>Good... but not good for diabetic folk.</li>
      <li>of the best things about Listerine is that it&#x27;s impossible to overdose on the stuff.</li>
      <li>Came at a decent price</li>
      <li>stores can charge a bit much for this (a regular-sized bottle can run anywhere from five to seven dollars) but this is one instance where the extra money is worth it (and seeing that Listerine does not sell their forumla to stores so they, in turn, can sell you a watered-down, inferior version demonstrates, to me, that the company is dedicated to fighting oral infection).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend</li>
      <li>After years of using other mouthwash products, an oral surgeon recommended Listerine to me as a better deterrant to fighting cavities and I must say that besides the vanity factor of longer lasting fresh breath and (possibly) whiter teeth, my mouth feels a thousand percent better every single time I rinse with Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>1.5 liters is a pretty big container.</li>
      <li>Once you&#x27;ve rinsed for a minute it doesn&#x27;t have much bite left.</li>
      <li>A bit; I sometimes wander away from the sink and rinse for far longer than 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>/&gt;We have tried to use other mouthwashes because they were on sale, but they never give you as fresh of a mouth as this one.</li>
      <li>It gives me long lasting fresh breath</li>
      <li>This is great if you have a problem with bad breath.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The secret to effective use is not being a wuss, and holding it in your mouth as long as you can stand it.</li>
      <li>My whole family has horribly soft teeth; despite regular care since we were young we have almost no original teeth.</li>
      <li>Now, I am willing to pay a little extra to get what I know works.</li>
      <li>I have for years, until now, used alternative mouth washes that had higher Ph&#x27;s, but then I decided to add a few tablespoons of baking soda to a big bottle of Listerine and voila!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My dentist recommended I use Listerine. According to her, other mouthwashes are flavored water.  I use Listerine at lease once a day, every day. I like minty fresh breath it gives. I use this in conjunction with brushing and flossing. According to my dentist I have almost no tartar or plaque and need only a light dental cleaning every 6 months!  The bottle last quite a while (about 3 months) and is cheaper here than in drug stores. I use it at least 2x a day. With Amazon Prime I get the product in 2 days with free shipping.</li>
    <li> This is a excellent product and it works very well.You just gargle this for a few seconds and your breath will be fresh for most of the day.This is great if you have a problem with bad breath.Listorine will make your breath smell nice and fresh.</li>
    <li> Very good and very big</li>
    <li> Cool Mint is awesome! This is my favorite choice from Listerine. It doesn&#x27;t burn, leaves a cool sensation in your mouth and your breath stays fresh longer! I would highly recommend</li>
    <li> I love the burn! A classic product that will always be a favorite. Leaves my mouth feeling fresh for  while after each use.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by our dentists and we like it very much. Have different size for home and travel use. Once in morning and once in night is what we do, and seems to work (based on dentist observations).</li>
    <li> I did tons of research into what was the best mouthwash for tartar control, various medical and dental websites, Listerine Coolmint was the consensus.</li>
    <li> Huge bottle! I like the taste.</li>
    <li> Great price and a large amount!</li>
    <li> Just what it says - mouth wash that tastes good.</li>
    <li> What is the deal with blue residue that keep accumulating around the bottle neck and  bathroom counter. I am thinking if that is also harming my teeth.</li>
    <li> After years of using other mouthwash products, an oral surgeon recommended Listerine to me as a better deterrant to fighting cavities and I must say that besides the vanity factor of longer lasting fresh breath and (possibly) whiter teeth, my mouth feels a thousand percent better every single time I rinse with Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution, though, and that is when you&#x27;re gargling you will feel as if your mouth is burning.  That&#x27;s good, though, because the mouthwash is fighing cavities and infection.  Once the tingling sensation wears off, you will almost hear your mouth thanking you.  (And, speaking from experience, do yourself the favor and save your money on the original Listerine formula - the yellow version - and the Citrus version.  The original formula most certainly has that antiseptic taste while the Citrus flavor doesn&#x27;t really do anything but taste different).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some stores can charge a bit much for this (a regular-sized bottle can run anywhere from five to seven dollars) but this is one instance where the extra money is worth it (and seeing that Listerine does not sell their forumla to stores so they, in turn, can sell you a watered-down, inferior version demonstrates, to me, that the company is dedicated to fighting oral infection).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listerine is also ideal to use if you have sensitive teeth.  - Donna Di Giacomo</li>
    <li> Listerine mouthwash contains dyes. The dye can actually stain your teeth. My dentist told me about it because I kept getting red stains at the gumline on my lower front teeth. I stopped using Listerine and guess what? NO MORE STAINS! It doesn&#x27;t affect everybody, but if you have unexplained stains on your teeth, try using a mouthwash with no dyes.</li>
    <li> Great product and service</li>
    <li> Good, old fashioned mouthwash</li>
    <li> I like the feeling of having a really good oral hygiene, this mouthwash just completes the process cleaning my mouth</li>
    <li> Enjoy the taste. Not like that of the original Listerine</li>
    <li> Exactly,as described! Great Service!, Fast Shipping! Thank-You!</li>
    <li> Second time I ordered it. Love this flavor and how my mouth feels great after I use it each morning.</li>
    <li> Five stars!  My mouth is so fresh and so clean clean.</li>
    <li> Cleans my mouth. Love the clean feeling.</li>
    <li> OH YEAH!  My mouth is clean and minty fresh.</li>
    <li> Its Listerine. What can I say? But it should&#x27;ve been wrapped in plastic as our mail carrier tossed it over our fence and it leaked a little bit. Can&#x27;t beat this price.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Great deal and great product.</li>
    <li> yes. Listerine is always good.</li>
    <li> Only brand I use. Great size to last a few months. No problems with expiration date. Doesn&#x27;t expire until 2017.</li>
    <li> Good... but not good for diabetic folk.</li>
    <li> I really like it. Now everyone have a great day!</li>
    <li> The burning in your mouth lets you know it&#x27;s working</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Listerine...what else can you say?  Cool mine has a great taste (If you can say that about Listerine.  lol)  Good price.</li>
    <li> the only mouthwash I don&#x27;t gag and spit in the sink</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Didn&#x27;t have to lug this back in a grocery bag.  Came at a decent price</li>
    <li> I use this daily to rinse my teeth and gargle..works great, kills germs, breath stays fresh all day</li>
    <li> Listerine is really good and the product works as advertised. However, you can find this same item $2 cheaper at Target or your local market. People come online to get cheaper prices most of the time. This is the reason why I am giving this product 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Still the best and works for me can&#x27;t be without at a great price.</li>
    <li> Great product.  G ood size for personal use. Good price.</li>
    <li> I agree that Listerine is a great product, but $8 for a 1.5 liter bottle?!!!  I can get it for $6 at Rite-Aid, and even cheaper with a coupon from the Sunday paper!  Way too expensive!!! (Just my 2 cents)</li>
    <li> Cool Mint Listerine is a big, shining, bright green reset button for your mouth. Regardless of whatever just happened in there, a few swooshes of Listerine will rid your maw of evil, and help you forget it ever happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best things about Listerine is that it&#x27;s impossible to overdose on the stuff. If you already used it in the morning, you&#x27;re safe to do it again at lunch, or even as a mid-afternoon refresher. There will be horrible days where you need to purge your mouth of putrescence multiple times, and Listerine will always be there for you. For college kids and newly single folks, Listerine is an absolute must have for making members of your preferred gender stick around and feel good about their mouths. You MUST have this stuff in your bathroom, in plain sight, at all times. It would be rude of you not to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret to effective use is not being a wuss, and holding it in your mouth as long as you can stand it. Don&#x27;t just let it stand there, swish it around and make sure every single surface of your mouth is covered. Once you&#x27;re numb to it, commit to a healthy gargle and let some of it slide down the back of your tongue and kill all the nasty things that live in your throat. As long as you can conquer the pain and fear of a Listerine rinse, it will conquer anything that ails your mouth-hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget about Scope, Crest and \\&quot;extra gentle\\&quot; Listerine. That stuff is as useful as Lava soap that doesn&#x27;t burn off the top layer of your skin. Suck it up, bite the bullet, and buy this stuff in bulk. You can never have too much Listerine.</li>
    <li> Good price for size offered. Will use this vendor frequently for bulk purchases or small ones alike. Name brand quality at economic prices.</li>
    <li> Sometimes after brushing my teeth, I didn&#x27;t really know why I still feel that my mouth isn&#x27;t clean and I am just so glad that this mouthwash is ever available to clean my mouth for better oral hygiene</li>
    <li> Listerine is by far the best brand for mouthwash. If you&#x27;ve tried other brands that bubble up weirdly when you gargle, rest assured that this product does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. 1.5 liters is a pretty big container. Make sure you know how large your order is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 20 years and cool mint is my favorite. It gives me long lasting fresh breath and i get that confidence to talk and laugh just the way i like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of alternative mouth washes, essential oils and herbal preparations including neem oil, and nothing works like Listerine to control plaque and safely keep mouth germs at bay. The only problem with Listerine, and it&#x27;s a major one, is that it is so acidic, it might be causing people to loose their tooth enamel. I have for years, until now, used alternative mouth washes that had higher Ph&#x27;s, but then I decided to add a few tablespoons of baking soda to a big bottle of Listerine and voila!  I got a Ph of about 8 using a testing strip. You&#x27;ll still feel that same burn that lets you know it&#x27;s working even after you balance the Ph.  So here&#x27;s a tip: get some Ph strips, get some baking soda, and add enough to your Listerine to give it a Ph of about 8 or 9. This will empower the Listerine to not only kill germs, fight plaque, and freshen breath, but it will NEUTRALIZE harmful acids in your mouth!</li>
    <li> The item was dented and the box it came in was crushed on one corner.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t know what the difference is between this and crest pro-health, but i do know this tastes a lot better and the after taste is really refreshing. Crest has the worst aftertaste in my opinion and i feel like my taste buds are burning after using crest-pro health. With Listerine, i feel like im actually doing my mouth a lot of good and getting rewarded with a tasty minty aftertaste. good buy at your local store</li>
    <li> taste great, leaves mouth feeling fresh and new and ready to tackle more crap that i eat.</li>
    <li> For me this is the &#x27;original&#x27;; people older than me might remember the amber colored stuff. Does it burn? A bit; I sometimes wander away from the sink and rinse for far longer than 30 seconds. Once you&#x27;ve rinsed for a minute it doesn&#x27;t have much bite left. Dental surgeon recommended it; not &#x27;mouthwash&#x27;, Listerine. Twice a day. Every day. I know a lot of people who have had gum work. Restorative dentist says I don&#x27;t need scaling an root planing, though with so many crowns I work hard to keep my gums healthy. Perhaps that&#x27;s why my gums are OK. While I had a bad tooth (it never got a chance to abscess) a hygienist asked me if I ever used Listerine in my Waterpik; I have and that had helped restore 4mm pockets to 1mm to 2mm. Several of my crowns had decay underneath; those spewed bacteria into my mouth continuously, but with regular cleaning, very little carbs for the bacteria to feed on and 6 month cleanings, it took years until the teeth were bad enough to require restoration. My whole family has horribly soft teeth; despite regular care since we were young we have almost no original teeth.</li>
    <li> My breathe smells like a fresh mints using before and after brushing my teeth. This mouthwash is the best to use.</li>
    <li> Out of all of the flavors of listerine, this is by far our favorite. There is something about that cool fresh feeling that makes you feel like you can tackle your day. The freshness lasts a long time too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have tried to use other mouthwashes because they were on sale, but they never give you as fresh of a mouth as this one. Now, I am willing to pay a little extra to get what I know works.</li>
    <li> awesome pantry filler item straight from Amazon w/ no extra trip to the supermarket needed!</li>
    <li> Works Well but after I purchased this item I visited my Dentist and they told me with my receding gums I should have ordered the alcohol free version of this or the Crest alcohol version. If you are an adult with receding gums (which is common) you would be better off with an alcohol free version.</li>
    <li> As a student in school, I use Listerine every morning to make sure my breath does not smell bad. I love the minty freshness in my mouth, and getting to know that my breath does not smell bad. This is definitely the best of the Listerine products. Not only does my breath smell good, I get no cavities or diseases in my mouth.</li>
