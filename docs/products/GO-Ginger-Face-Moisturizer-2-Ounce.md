      <li>This is my new favorite face cream.</li>

      <li>Day or night is right for this cream.</li>
      <li>Not sure it&#x27;s working any magic, but it&#x27;s definitely nice and doesn&#x27;t have any yucky chemicals, so no complaints.</li>
      <li>I have recently run out and will be getting more today.</li>
      <li>My hand and feet are soft and rash free</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not really &#x27;greasy&#x27;, but it feels kind of greasy on my oily (combo) skin.  </li>
      <li>This moisturizer has such a refreshing feel to it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and moisturizing and agrees with my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I expected a slightly more ginger-ey smell, but the scent is pretty mild.</li>
      <li>I have really noticed a difference in my skin.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Maybe my skin just can&#x27;t tolerate too much ginger.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it seems to be working fine!</li>
      <li>I first tried a sample of GO Ginger Face Moisturizer at the Natural Products Expo.</li>
      <li>I get a refreshing scent and slight \\&quot;zing\\&quot; of ginger when applying.</li>
      <li>It goes on nice and light with a faint ginger scent.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to others.  </li>
      <li>I used this three times on a freshly wash face and each time I got red patches of irrational.</li>
      <li>At the age of 53, my skin is changing and within a few days of using these products, my skin looked and felt better.</li>
      <li>Also, my skin tone (pale) seems more even.</li>
      <li>Love the fact that it is natural and not full of chemicals.</li>
      <li>So far it seems to be making my face soft and very moisturized.</li>
      <li>The scent is just right - not so light that it is dull and not overpowering or lingering.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>This product surprised me!</li>
      <li>Saw the positive change in the texture of my skin by the third day.</li>
      <li>I was a little leary on others comments on the scent, but I think it is a light scent and does not linger all day.  </li>
      <li>nearly every moisturizer i use does.</li>
      <li>The ginger moisturizer has a light, almost fluffy texture, not at all greasy.</li>
      <li>only downside is that people with very dry skin may need to use a more intense moisturizer together with this one, at least in the winter.</li>
      <li>I use it not only on the sensitive skin on my face, but also other areas of my body with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this as I like the other products produced by The Ginger People (edibles).  </li>

<li> so I use as little as possible.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t make me break out as long as I use the right amount but the bumps are a disappointment.  </li>
<li> will not use any other cream besides this one from now on.</li>
<li> However the lid was slightly opened and almost half of it leaked out.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not just a ginger fragrance there are subtle undertones of Chinese food or Thai, NOT something I want to walk around smelling like.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just too thick for me.  </li>
<li> not as badly, i noticed tiny bumps on my forehead when I started using this line.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ll try a thin layer of shea butter over the ginger moisturizer.</li>
<li> You will not be disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I first tried a sample of GO Ginger Face Moisturizer at the Natural Products Expo. Can a face moisturizer almost instantly keep pre-50 wrinkles at bay? I think this one helps, so I bought it! I get a refreshing scent and slight \\&quot;zing\\&quot; of ginger when applying. It&#x27;s light and moisturizing and agrees with my sensitive skin. I&#x27;d like to find a way to carry a tiny bit with me for active days after washing my face. This product surprised me! Try it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer for the money. Not sure it&#x27;s working any magic, but it&#x27;s definitely nice and doesn&#x27;t have any yucky chemicals, so no complaints.</li>
    <li> The ginger moisturizer has a light, almost fluffy texture, not at all greasy. It smells like ginger, but the odor doesn&#x27;t trigger asthma for me like jasmine or patchouli or gardenia, so I&#x27;m very happy about that! My skin feels good after I apply the product. Also, my skin tone (pale) seems more even. However, after using the product for a week or so I had to travel and my skin care routine (minimal at best) is on hold till I&#x27;m back home. Will resume regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that people with very dry skin may need to use a more intense moisturizer together with this one, at least in the winter. I&#x27;ll try a thin layer of shea butter over the ginger moisturizer. All in all, I&#x27;m pleased with the product and intend to buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite face cream. And I have literally tried them all!&lt;br /&gt;At has a wonderfully refreshing ginger scent, because it is made form real ginger!&lt;br /&gt;And I must say I have seen a difference in my skins tone and brightness.&lt;br /&gt;I will not use any other cream besides this one from now on.</li>
    <li> It is a light moisturizer that gets the job done.  Goes on smooth and light and the fragrance is not  overpowering.  I was a little leary on others comments on the scent, but I think it is a light scent and does not linger all day.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this as I like the other products produced by The Ginger People (edibles).  It&#x27;s just too thick for me.  I need a light moisturizer and this isn&#x27;t light.  It&#x27;s not really &#x27;greasy&#x27;, but it feels kind of greasy on my oily (combo) skin.  Might work for others, but not for me.  I expected a slightly more ginger-ey smell, but the scent is pretty mild.</li>
    <li> Loooove this! I have very sensitive skin and it works great! Doesnt cause a break out for me and nearly every moisturizer i use does.</li>
    <li> I Love the fragrance and the feel.  It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs nicely.  I have recently run out and will be getting more today.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has such a refreshing feel to it. Very happy I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. So far it seems to be making my face soft and very moisturized. The ginger leaves your skin feeling refreshed and tingling. That being said, it&#x27;s the smell that&#x27;s the problem! I LOVE anything ginger, the smell, the taste, etc. But this moisturizer smells like Thai food! I put it on one day and my husband went to kiss me and said, \\&quot;did you have Thai today\\&quot;? It&#x27;s not just a ginger fragrance there are subtle undertones of Chinese food or Thai, NOT something I want to walk around smelling like. So I have resorted to just using it at night before bedtime. Other than that, it seems to be working fine!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Saw the positive change in the texture of my skin by the third day. Fan/user for life.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  I have really noticed a difference in my skin.  I would highly recommend this product to others.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love, love the product!  However the lid was slightly opened and almost half of it leaked out.</li>
    <li> I used this three times on a freshly wash face and each time I got red patches of irrational. Not itchy or burning or raised just a mild irration. Being cheap and not wanted to toss the bottle I tried on my hands and feet and they were fine. My hand and feet are soft and rash free so I will finish the jar and not reorder.</li>
    <li> It has good texture, and gets absorbed quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this cream four times (2x for my daughter &amp; 2x for myself).  Both us us enjoy that this cream is a wonderful moisturizer that is not greasy and has the genuine scent of fresh ginger.  The scent is just right - not so light that it is dull and not overpowering or lingering.  My daughter loves it as a night cream and I use it as an all day moisturizer.  I plan to purchase this again soon.</li>
    <li> not bad.  would prefer a different container.  If I put too much, I seem to get more clogged pores so I use as little as possible.  Also would need to exfoliate more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Like the serum but not as badly, i noticed tiny bumps on my forehead when I started using this line.  I&#x27;ve stopped using the serum but still continue to use this.  It doesn&#x27;t make me break out as long as I use the right amount but the bumps are a disappointment.  Maybe my skin just can&#x27;t tolerate too much ginger.</li>
    <li> This is ginger in cream form: the great, invigorating smell of ginger that makes your skin feel fresh and rejuvenated. It is light, but thoroughly moisturizing. Day or night is right for this cream. The two oz jar will easily last you 2-3 months.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! It goes on nice and light with a faint ginger scent. It doesn&#x27;t leave your face sticky or greasy and I love the way my skin feels when I use it!</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and their Face Serum. At the age of 53, my skin is changing and within a few days of using these products, my skin looked and felt better. The moisturizer can feel a little heavy at first but it doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy. I am very pleased with the results of both products. Now I want to try the others. I love, love, love their drinks!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use it not only on the sensitive skin on my face, but also other areas of my body with sensitive skin. I wish they would come up with a similar body lotion.</li>
    <li> Love the fact that it is natural and not full of chemicals. Does a great job, I have oily skin so I cant use something too heavry.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to nighttime moisturizer. The smell is delicious and feels rich and quenching on my skin. Bonus! Great ingredients, too.</li>
    <li> really nice, light and smells wonderful...I will purchase again I am sure. another plus are the estrogenic free ingredients..great company!</li>
