<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This, as every product I&#x27;ve used from Origins, makes my skin feel refreshed, rejuvenated and just plain yummy.  Love it!</li>
    <li> After I started using this cleanser, my intermittent adult acne completely cleared up. Best cleanser I&#x27;ve used. Has a delightful but not overwhelming citrus scent. This is the nth one I&#x27;ve purchased and my main hope is that Origins never stops making and selling it.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  It cleanses my skin and leaves it fresh, clean, and supple.  You only need a pea drop to wash your face, so it lasts a long time.  I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> This face wash was really great and got all of my make up off, but it made me break out so bad! I got a lot of acne, not just black heads but big, red and painful acne. I really liked the way it cleaned my face and it smelled really great, I just couldn&#x27;t use it for fear of breaking out!</li>
    <li> It smells great (a little strong at first but I got used to it), and the best part is that it removes all the oil and crap on my face, especially after doing frying, but it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year now and it&#x27;s still my favorite!  You only need a small amount worked up into a super rich lather and it feels amazing!  I usually use a toner after I was my face at night and would always see more dirt, make-up, whatever on the cotton pad - not with this!  I t really works to get your skin clean.  I have combination skin - I use this in the warmer (and more moist) months and Origins Cleansing Oil in the cold and dry months.  The oil works wonders as well and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily at all.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.  When I started using it about 4 years ago I stopped wearing makeup and haven&#x27;t needed to wear makeup since.  Nothing will ever compare so hopefully Origins will make it forever!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face wash. I had oily skin and this keeps it balanced without over drying it. I use it with a Clarisonic and my skin feels great.</li>
    <li> This product does not cleanse the skin of the regular dirt deposited, nor makeup.  It costs far too much and doesn&#x27;t perform.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this. Product. I threw mine away.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin. Smells fresh and cleans really well without drying your skin. Slightly foamy and you need a very small amount so this stuff lasts forever. I use it with my clairsonic and have nothing but rave reviews for the combo.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, sometimes sensitive skin. Origins is the only skin care product I will use right now. It&#x27;s a great product for the price. Particularly in the winter time, my skin gets very and red, and using a combination of this cleanser with the Origins moisturizer and toner keeps my skin very healthy with no dry red breakouts. Love it!</li>
    <li> Product is good, tracking is fast, packaging is elegant and has a  small gift. I&#x27;m very love it. It&#x27;s a very good experience.I will be continue to support it.</li>
    <li> It works really well on your skin, helping to clean out your pores - gently.</li>
    <li> I have had acne/bad skin since I was in 5th grade. I have taken Accutane, tried ProActive, as well as massive amounts of other products both prescription and otherwise. I purchased this after reading a few reviews and tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;Week One: I am used to unfortunate breakouts and this made a bad breakout worse. The pimples got red and swollen and filled with serous fluid that took a couple days to clear up. My skin was dried out and started flaking within two days. I was a little unhappy to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;Week Two: My tone started to even out and I stopped wearing base/cover up even on my breakout spots. I used Bare Minerals pressed powder and went almost everyday without wearing more makeup than that. My skin felt better and I noticed when I did have a zit or two, they were clear within a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;Week Three: VERY ODD breakouts made me a little nervous but I noticed that it was very specific to my traditional trouble spots. *May be too much information but everyone experiences acne differently - the puss or goop coming out of my pores started to become harder, thicker, and almost chalky in texture compared to the oily gross mess I typically have during a break out*&lt;br /&gt;Week Four: Back to wearing almost no makeup and loving my tone. I use a light moisturizer in the mornings and wash both morning and night. My acne is clearing every day and I love the way my skin feels when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Skin goes through cycles and changing your skincare regimen can make people break out but getting through a breakout means your skin is getting rid of dirt/scum deep under the surface. I won&#x27;t stop using this product unless something catastrophic happens - I have never had better skin.</li>
    <li> my wife wanted it so I ordered it to replace one she already used up.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this product. It has a light scent, and it makes me skin feel clean. I have extremely sensitive and problematic skin, and despite an initial breakout, my skin is clean and clearing up. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I started with Origins products in February of this year and am extremely pleased.  They&#x27;re expensive but a little bit goes a very long way.  This has a very light, foaming consistency which seems to clean quickly.  Fragrance is quite nice as well.</li>
