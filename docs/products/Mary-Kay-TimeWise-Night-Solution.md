<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using Mary Kay&#x27;s Timewise line for about 4 years. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this line. I use the night solution daily!</li>
    <li> Arrived new in box, unlike other items ordered from amazon. Great deal. Have tried this before in sample and liked it. I like most of the timewise line, only didnt like the botanicals line, or care for the makeup. Visible results, not drying or make acne. Have wanted this for awhile and now affordable thanks to amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. When you use time wise night solution you began to see a change in your right away. I recommend this product for all women but especially mature skin. It really works.</li>
    <li> Great product to keep skin looking young</li>
    <li> though we may fee mary kay products are expensive but due to minimal usage and maximum results - they are value for money</li>
    <li> Great product to keep aging skin supple without being greasy -- all while you sleep!  I recommend it to anyone approaching 40 and beyond.</li>
    <li> It was hard to finish this book, as much of the subject matter was too technical and detailed, using excessive terminology that an ornithologist for biologist would be comfortable with, but not an interested layman like me.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have it on my night stand and use it every night after cleaning off the day&#x27;s dirt and grime! It immediately softens and refreshes my skin. Delivered in perfect condition and on time. Will return to purchase more when necessary.</li>
    <li> just what I expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure where all the rave reviews are coming from regarding this product...???  I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference at all after using it.  Maybe I was expecting too much??...</li>
    <li> I have been using the night solution for ten years and would not miss a day of use.  It is excellent in keeping the skin firm.</li>
    <li> love this stuff. i use it during the day as a moisturizer or at night. ive only been able to find one moisturizer that i dont hate. most of them make my skin feel heavy or oily. and yes ive spent the big bucks on name brand or derm. only ones and even the oil free ones dont make a difference. this stuff on the other hand i love. feels like my skin is just more naturally moist on it&#x27;s own. can&#x27;t tell i even have a product on. i love to put it on and around my eyes as well because those can get really dry. i wouldn&#x27;t officially recommend putting any product on ur eyes but i can say i haven&#x27;t had a problem with doing so with this. again, doesnt make them feel heavy or sticky..... also can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I used to use this religiously, unitl I started using the Clear Proof by Mary Kay, I still use this, it helps with lightening the acne spots.</li>
    <li> Surprised on how fast I received my order.  Item works great.  I would order again.</li>
    <li> Great product. I just love Mary Kay products. I really like the Timewise products. Your face really feels refreshed after you put it on. Love this. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Very good product by Mary Kay - I bought this as a gift for an aunt. I can tell she&#x27;s very happy with the product. She loves Mary Kay and states that all her products are of the highest quality. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using this, Mary Kay Timewise Night Solution, for many years and I am very happy with the result.</li>
