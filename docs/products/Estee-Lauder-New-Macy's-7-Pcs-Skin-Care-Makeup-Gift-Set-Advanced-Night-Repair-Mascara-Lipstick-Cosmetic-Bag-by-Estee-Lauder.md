    <li> Good, delivered. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift for my mom &amp; she really enjoyed it. Great color choices for the lipsticks, and really great mascara.&lt;br /&gt;The price is really good considering that is included in this set. If you&#x27;ve yet to try Estee Lauder cosmetics, this has a good selection of various cosmetics.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a present, so I couldn&#x27;t properly review it as I didn&#x27;t use the products, but my cousin was happy with the gift.&lt;br /&gt;I do think it makes a really nice gift for a girl and the price is pretty good.</li>
    <li> I love getting these as I have a chance to try the samples and then purchase what works well.  This is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I ordered the make up set from this seller that stated it had 7 pieces of makeup that came with the bag. When I received the item in the mail all that was there was a bag with no makeup.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase! I will order from this company again. Love Este Lauder and have been using the product line for years.</li>
    <li> This product was not as described, the bag was the only thing sent. It did not include any of the other products stated.</li>
    <li> I wish we could have chosen the color set we wanted the one I received is very mild in color so light there is no real use in wearing it</li>

    <li> This was a useless, cheap set.  I would be very embarrassed to give this as a gift.</li>

    <li> This has never happen to me  before.&lt;br /&gt;Bought three bags to give as a gift to my best friends.&lt;br /&gt;I was at her side when one of my friends opened her gift.  I was deeply disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;It looked like this little gifts you get from Macy&amp;#34;s when you buy perfums and beauty/treatment products.&lt;br /&gt;I felt like crying so unhappy I became.&lt;br /&gt;It is a cheap product and i&#x27;ll never buy form this dealer again.&lt;br /&gt;The photo  and the description do not show the real product offered.</li>
