<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it is really good, especially when you used with the one &#x27;n only shampoo</li>
    <li> the bottle i received was defective! the spray doesn&#x27;t work --- isn&#x27;t that a point of the product? -_____-&lt;br /&gt;also, the smell isn&#x27;t that great. it smells like roses or something</li>
    <li> This product is a light, non-greasy, &amp; smells really good too! I like to put it on my ends.....my hair loves it!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I had bought it in the store and then went back for more. I could not find it again until I check on Amazon.  It works great on straight, fine hair.  It does not look greasy or put any &amp;#34;weight&amp;#34; on the hair.  It helps hair look healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> The smell, the smell is a bit too strong for me.</li>
    <li> The bottle is quite large, I was surprised! This product makes my hair very soft with only a couple of sprays. But I use it every day so it is going quite fast! Also, this product smells great.</li>
    <li> not sure if real - seems like knock off-&lt;br /&gt;label was all in Spanish&lt;br /&gt;will keep as too costly to return&lt;br /&gt;will not buy again</li>
    <li> I use argan oil for my face and also used it for my hair before. I put two drops in the palms of my hand, rubbed it together and then just brushed with my hands gently all over my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It left my hair shiny, but no oily and did not way it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil spray however distributed way to much , even as it has a very fine nozzle  so I found gulps of hair saturated with oil? shiny and almost wet looking? I have long hair and only used two sprays for the whole hair. Tried it out 3 days in a row, same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product did arrive having leaked during shipment, not sure if something is maybe really wrong with the nozzle? But it is going back. Will cont to us the argan oil I already have</li>
    <li> I tried this product and it really helps to get the tangles out while brushing.  My hair would always be tangled after washing and you just spray this on it gets the tangles out.  It does not make your hair feel oily or heavy.  It smells good.  Great product.  I needed to find a product that gets the tangles out without pulling all of my hair out and this works.  It was recommended to me by a person that works with hair.</li>
    <li> Does exactly as describe. The product has a great smell and cuts down on the frizziness. Will continue to purchase this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I use this after I blow dry my hair because sometimes it looks like it needs a little extra moisture.  This works great.  I will buy this again.  It does have an odor, but unlike some of the reviews that I read about it, it does not smell offensive.  I have had a lot of people tell me that they like how I smell, but it&#x27;s actually my hair they are smelling.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very nice and smells good, but I think it will better for curly hair.</li>
    <li> i have long, healthy, but not thick hair.  My hair can look limp and flat if i don&#x27;t style. I used this on damp hair, the blow dry and style and my hair looks thicker, shiney and super healthy. I have also used on dry hair for shine and smoothness and again my hair looks incredible; and it smells lovely as do all their products. I just bought another bottle for my nieces who have thick curly hair, according to reviews it should work wonders for her type of hair.  I&#x27;ll trying their shampoos and conditioners next.</li>
    <li> Great product, my hair never looked so good. I used the One&#x27;n Only Argan Oil before and I love it, but in spray make it more accessible to use it without have to get your hands full of oil, specially when not in the house. (Have it always in my purse) :)</li>
    <li> I love this because I can just spray it on my hair after I get out of the shower. Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I like this product , it gives a lot shine and a bouncy look. DO NOT mistake the product for a heat protectant .</li>
    <li> Good product, will buy more when we run out.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!  I highly recommend it for my hair type(coarse, african american) I don&#x27;t have a relaxer. I spray each section of my hair at root level before flat ironing.  Wow, I have never had better results.  It leaves your hair super shiny, soft and it smells absolutely amazing.  If you have coarse hair and a good flat iron, I am imploring you to buy this product.  I have never had a product make such an immediate difference on my hair.</li>
    <li> Have fine dry hair, this really helps.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have thick wavy (not curly) hair that does what it wants, which often translates into frizz, especially when it&#x27;s dry outside (yes it actually does better in humidity).  I have discovered in recent years that straight oil works wonders for my hair as opposed to normal conditioner and other hair products, so I use this sometimes as the only after shower product or other times after the mousse. It is essentially a spray oil, and it helps fight the frizz. Yes it has some crap chemicals in it but hey it smells good and does what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> It Took A Minute to Come I Had Been Looking for Product for a While</li>
    <li> i really enjoy how this smells and I also feel like it definitely does NOT make my hair greasy which is great</li>
    <li> Smells great. Very light weight.</li>
    <li> Great stuff and smells awesome.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to spray and definitely don&#x27;t get it on your skin as it&#x27;s very greasy.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for people with easily oily hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;m a bit too lazy/inept to do much with my hair, and I discovered that using this along with some kind of defrizz serum on wet hair makes my air-dried hair seem much tamer and lie more flat than without it -- it comes as close as I&#x27;ve ever gotten to having hair that looks like I blew it out when my lazy butt actually just let it dry on it&#x27;s own! Every now and then I&#x27;ll try some pricier product that has rave reviews, and they never work as well. I finally realized that since I like this, there&#x27;s not point in wasting money looking for something better. This does it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it helps decide if this is right for you, I have long, thick, lighly curly, frizz-prone hair. This helps reduce the volume and frizz. I really like the sleek look of blown-out hair, and this gets me fairly close without the effort.</li>
    <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Works well to ease tangles but not too heavy to weight down my partially curly hair.</li>
    <li> Meets expectation. I notice more of a shine after use.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing multi-tasking product. Works effectively as a detangler, heat protectant, leave-in conditioner and shine spray. Makes my hair unbelievably smooth, shiny, hydrated and healthy looking. Never leaves hair greasy. Comes out in a fine, even mist. This is a necessity for me.</li>
    <li> This oil is so light and a little goes a long way. I love the light fragrance as well. I use it for my hair as well as my 1 year old son&#x27;s hair. It has many uses. You can use it to seal, as a heat protectant, to add shine to your hair, and on your scalp. I highly recommend this product. I have 4a/b relaxed hair.</li>
    <li> I love this spray! The spray ensures you can get the product where you really need it.  I&#x27;ve had the regular bottled oil which is very good also but I prefer the spay!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and works great!  Good price for the size of the bottle. Will be buying more when I run out of it.</li>
    <li> Im in love with this product, i finally found something thays not greasy/oily, and something that has a very pleasant scent, i will always buy this product from noe till forever and no more friz! Silky smooth like if i just got out the hair solon  Thank u!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 years now, and it is a simple light weight spray that adds just the right amount of shine to your hair and helps keep things from getting too frizzy.  This is the only product I use other than a conditioning rinse.  Treat your colored hair with care.</li>
    <li> Bad quality oil made my hair dry. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I have color treated hair.  It can become very damaged on humid, hotter days.  I also am an avid runner which can make my hair really dry after all the sweat.  I did not know if the Argan oil would work considering all the circumstances...but IT DID!  After showering, I spray the Argan  oil all over my hair, then put it in a bun overnight.  In the morning when I style my hair, I add additional spray.  My hair looks shiny and soft. It is also very manageable when detailing my hair after a shower and the gym.  This product has been one of the best products to have multiple purposes.  I just ordered my second one.  I will use the spray mechanism and just pour the new Argan oil into the spray dispenser.  I can&#x27;t believe how nice my hair feels as it reduces all the appearances of frizz, and damage.  This is an unbelievable product.  This products works for the worst cases : bad, humid weather, frizzing, sweat, tangles, color treatments.  I recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Very nice, smells good, works great to tame my hair!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It leaves hair very soft without weighing it down.  I am definitely ordering this again.  Love it.</li>
    <li> smells great works good on thick hair</li>
    <li> This spray is extremely lite and smells great! Its doesn&#x27;t take very much so this will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I hate this spray. It doesn&#x27;t work as advertised at all.</li>
    <li> This makes my hair SO silky smooth, and it replaces a cabinet full of products. Will never be without this!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it made my hair silky smooth. It actually worked a lot better than I thought it would.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
    <li> This product is excellect for bringing to life hair that is dry and dull. It gives your hair an awesome shine without being greasy.  It is also a 5 star product for softening and straightening fly away hair.  Oh, yes, the fragrance is a great added bonus.  Oprah had her favorite things, girls you buy One &amp;#34;n Only Argan Oil Spray Treatment and you will your new favorite thing too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;iloved</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE with this line of Aragon oil product. I have very long hair that I can never brush through without lots of pain and hair loss, but a few sprays of this oil and I can brush through it like butter, even when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very light and absorbs well. I have baby fine blonde hair and everything is heavy on it. This doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.</li>
    <li> Love, love, this productd.  It&#x27;s an oil treatment that is not oily feeling and it softens the hair and makes it shine!!</li>
    <li> It made my hair  soft and silky :) .&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed no tangles when i sprayed it on to the damp hair.</li>
    <li> The quality of this product exceeded my expectations tremendously! It makes your hair very soft and it helps with thermal protection as well! A+ One &#x27;n Only!</li>
    <li> This has become my new flat iron spray (and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried many who claimed to be the best).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The One &#x27;n Only oil spray is more like a mist, which is good for heavy handed people who tend to go spray crazy! I spray a little all over my damp hair prior to blow drying and then a little on each section prior to flat ironing my hair. Also, one a month I use One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil Restorative Mask.  The combination of both products leave my hair looking so healthy and shiny! FYI, I have 3a/b natural hair.</li>
    <li> It is light on the hair, and it does make my hair shiny without it looking oily. However, it didn&#x27;t give my hair the &#x27;bounce&#x27; that I expected it too.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, coarse, wavy hair and this keeps it soft and tangle free.  I was worried about it being to oily or causing product build-up in my hair but it does neither.  It&#x27;s great and I will definitely purchase again.  An added bonus, it smells very good.</li>
    <li> Tried a new hairdresser who used this sparingly on my very fine hair, I thought I was going to end up with a oily mess.  However, that wasn&#x27;t the case, what I got was soft shiny hair. Got home and immediately ordered a bottle. I spray it onto my wet hair paddle brush, no more tangles for me!!</li>
    <li> I have been dying my hair for years and years, mostly bleach. Needless to say I have damaged fine hair and need some moisture and shine. This oil smells really nice and does reduce some frizz, but doesn&#x27;t particularly make my hair shine. I was hoping it would make my hair look silky smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t look much different other than less frizz.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist/cutter used this product on my hair. I asked her what it was and whether or not she would recommend it for my hair. She said yes and tried to sell it for $30 from the place. I thought that price was crazy! And so I turned to Amazon and it offered for it $18 less! So I ordered it and it came when it said it would. However, when I got it,  it was extremely hot and had some of the oil covering the outside of the bottle. I think next time amazon prime needs to put a &amp;#34;DO NOT LEAVE IN HOT environments&amp;#34; or some warning label to the mail deliverer. Otherwise, I love this product and it does wonders for my type of Asian, fine hair!</li>
    <li> This oil spray is great.  Works really well on my beard and smell great.  Works well on thick or course hair. But makes thin or fine hair limp.</li>
    <li> I have very frizzy, fine hair. I&#x27;m always looking for products that eliminate the frizz &amp; are alcohol free so I made the purchase.  I was dissapointed that it didn&#x27;t eliminate any of my frizz like i was hoping. I still had to use my anti-frizz serum.  The good thing is that it smells great and it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, but didnt do squat for the frizzies.</li>
    <li> This is a very fine, almost dry oil mist that I mist my hair with before I put on spray gel. It helps with shine and heat protection. Great stuff, and smells great, as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the oil for about four years now, but I like the spray because I have more control over how much is being used and I feel I&#x27;m getting more even coverage. Great price for this as well.</li>
    <li> Amazing for hair I love it makes my hair look and feel amazing and helps manage my hair and keep it tame</li>
    <li> Item received on time ans as described by seller. This is a really good product. Loght weight and adds instant shine. I&#x27;ll continue to use over the next few weeks and see if it continues to exceed my expectations.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Originally purchased a bottle in Mexico on vacation.  Disappointed I couldn&#x27;t bring it home because the airport took it out and kept it.  But I love it.  I have long straight hair and you use need a little.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and you just need a tiny little bit (will last forever)!  My hair gets frizzy with rain/humidity and this stuff works great.  Put a little on before blow dry/flat iron and it smooths everything out.  I put a little on in the morning too to calm down the ends of my hair - - great product!!!</li>
    <li> Use daily for great help with dead ends.</li>
    <li> I recently converted to One &#x27;n Only Argan Oil products and I&#x27;m in love. They don&#x27;t weigh my hair down and help cut down styling time and frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spray treatment is a great finishing spray to tame fly aways and add shine.  :)</li>
    <li> I am in love with argan hair care products! Only thing in the world that has done anything for my unruly curly hair and crazy frizz!!! This spray can be used on both wet or dry hair. I use it on both, but be careful when using it on dry hair. Only use a little on dry hair, or else you&#x27;ll end up with a greasey look! But this is a great product. However, if you have a sally&#x27;s beauty supply you can get this SAME spray treatment for ONLY $8.99 .</li>
    <li> Not oily or greasy (unless you go overboard), this spray is just what the hair doctor ordered. I am 65 years old and my hair has a new shine! The light fragrance is so pleasant.</li>
    <li> For someone who suffers from dry hair, using this product especially after wash and my natural coconut milk treatment - it&#x27;s wonderful. I deep condition with coconut milk, a little coconut oil, a little avocado oil, a tiny bit of either argan oil or castor oil and after washing that out I spray this on. I have extremely dry hair and scalp - that&#x27;s gone!</li>
    <li> I bought this to give my granddaughter some moisture to her hair.  She wants to keep her hair long and likes it to be straightened. When it is not straightened she &amp;#34;forgets&amp;#34; how to comb her hair. :)  I used the One &#x27;n Only ceramic straightener and within no time I had straightened her hair and she LOVED it.  The aroma is wonderful and was not greasy on my hands.  In fact while giving her the treatment I also gave my hands a treatment.  I am very pleased with this product and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Surprise, it actually does make my hair look much better.  It&#x27;s easy to apply with the spray bottle.  I am buying another one of these for me and two more for my friends with lack lustre hair like my own.  Give it a try, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
    <li> It smells great, feels great, and I&#x27;m happy with that part. All of the ingredients aren&#x27;t listed, though. It contains dimethicone, which I try to avoid, and it&#x27;s not listed here, but is on the bottle.</li>
    <li> It really does make hair shiny!! Just be careful not to overdo or will end up with greasy hair.  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Smells good and works good. I just love anything argan. I recommend spraying this on your hands than apply to hair instead of spraying directly on hair.</li>
    <li> I use this product as a &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; for my days in between washings. It is great and smells really good. I can see where some may consider the smell to be kind of perfume-like, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it is oil, it doesn&#x27;t look oily in the hair. I have long, wavy hair that can get oily very fast. I was initially worried that this would make my hair look greasy but it doesn&#x27;t at all. It gives my hair a nice sheen and I feel like it helps keep it moisturized and with less fly-away.</li>
    <li> I would recommend Argan Oil Spray to any one that is having a bad hair day. I was afraid this product would leave my hair oily, just the opposite it gives body and shine. I love it!</li>
    <li> Effective and it lasts long. made my hair healthy again and I bleach my hair every 2 months.</li>
    <li> makes hair very smooth without weighing it down  and has no alcohol in it very nice smell dont need much a few sprays</li>
    <li> This is a great product! The oil is awesome, and it makes your hair feel super soft, when in your hair!</li>
    <li> First time buying this.  I have used it a few times now, it makes my hair look healthy and shinny. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> It gives my hair the perfect amount of finish after whatever style I choose! Has a nice shine to it but doesn&#x27;t look oily! Makes my hair feel nice and smooth but still holds my friz while doing it!</li>
    <li> My teen daughter and i love this stuff! It makes your hair so soft and shiny!! Happy to have found it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It is amazing and I love the way it makes my hair feel. I am ordering another bottle as we speak. :)</li>
    <li> ok product service A+</li>
    <li> Love it!! love the fact that I can spray this on my hair for a beautiful sheen. I am very pleased with the product and will continue using it. I also love the fragrance of Moroccan oil.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t live up to the hype. Left my hair flat and greasy immediately and took awhile to absorb. Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This does not weigh down my hair and makes it feel nice and healthy.  My hair is very thin and brittle. I have noticed less hair loss using this product and my hair is not greasy looking or feeling.</li>
    <li> Love the product! Use it on wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is also good as heat protector when using hot tools.</li>
    <li> Lovely ragrance. I use to detangle....works very well. Big bottle.</li>
    <li> Did not make a big difference on my hair. It was still hard to comb through after using.</li>
    <li> This argan oil spray is incredible. It makes my hair very soft and not at all greasy. I will be buying this product again and again.</li>
    <li> This product really helps with the dry frizziness that assaults my hair each winter. Wish I had found it much soon. Makes for wonderfully smooth, but NOT oily hair.</li>
    <li> Great for a finish spray.  I have very dry coarse hair and like to use this as a final spray for shine.</li>
    <li> It was delivered promptly and was exactly what I order. My only problem was it didn&#x27;t do what I had hoped and that&#x27;s get rid of some of the static electricity too. It did smooth out my curls but was also a tiny bit too greasy for my thinning hair. My gf just loves it though, so each to their own, and hair types.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and have tried many of the sprays for softening and taking away frizz.  This stuff is the absolute best I have tried.  I put it on my hair while the hair is still wet and dry it with the oil on.  It makes my curly hair have soft, frizz free curls. I have fine thin hair as well and it does not weigh it down at all. I am loading up on inventory just in case it would get discontinued down the road for any reason.</li>
    <li> Thank you!! A+A+A+A+A+</li>
    <li> I love this product. ..my hair looks really  healthy....I really recommend  it. ....I have long and curly hair n it works for my hair</li>
    <li> Shipped right away.  Use this daily.  Works pretty good on my hair and extensions.</li>
    <li> I have really long, fine, thin hair.  Generally, I only use coconut oil as a deep conditioner every other day because my hair tends to get oily.  However, I was able to spray this on my hair and it was not greasy.  My daughters both have fine hair, but it is curly.  This stuff makes it shine!!  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love it. Great price and it works!!</li>
    <li> So in love with this I keep ordering more and more. I have told numerous people about this and they all have nothing but good reviews on it. I don&#x27;t find my hair oily like I typically do with other types of treatment sprays. I have currently been using it for 2 years and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;I spray it on when my hair is damp right before I blow dry, I&#x27;m not sure if I am using it correctly but it works for me.  I feel this product is reasonably priced. I highly highly highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I use it for 3 month it very good i really love it and i recommend it</li>
    <li> I like the shine this spray provides. It also helps detangle my hair. I prefer the spray form of Argan oil because it is far easier to apply. Fast delivery, fair price.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Great for my curly hair. Smells great.</li>
    <li> This is received on time and I bought it for my sister and she likes and it gives shine and also protects from heat.</li>
    <li> My favorite argan oil spray to use after taking a shower!!! and smells really good</li>
    <li> I LOVE this spray! It smells amazing and leaves my hair and skin feeling really smooth and healthy</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Instantly makes my hair easy to comb through.</li>
    <li> I air dry my hair and spray this on after light towel drying and it has helped a TON! It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy and lasts forever.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, and leaves you with great shine.... But also attracts all the dust in the air and you&#x27;ll need to wash EVERY day if you use this. There are better brands out there for the oil/spray... though I love many of their other products</li>
    <li> I live in a hot and humid state. I recently reverted to my natural state and I have tried many different products. My hair is fine and curly. It is nearly impossible to fight the frizz, but this product does it well. It leaves my curls, soft, shiny and defined  without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I use this spray after a shower when my hair is wet before combing through my hair. It is light and helps me to not pull my long hair out. Only a little is needed so it is lasting me a long time. Really pleasant scent. When I run out I will be buying more. I love this product.</li>
    <li> This is my go to product. I use as a leave in conditioner, as heat protection, and as a finishing mist. Doesn&#x27;t make my oily hair greasy.</li>
    <li> I have very dry red hair.  I use sulfate free conditioning cleansers and only \\&quot;wash\\&quot; my hair once every 6 - 8 days.  During the winter my hair can get static electricity and looses some of its shine.  I do not like to use regular gloss or shin products because of the heavy alcohol content, flammability and fact that no matter how long I let the products dry when I comb my hair again they leave it looking greasy.  This product helps with the fly-way static and puts the shine back in my hair but it is not greasy after it dries.  I also think this product has improved the condition of my hair unlike a much more expensive product that made my hair fall out.  This product lasts a long time and I have used it very liberally for over a month and you can barely tell there is any less in the bottle.  Very happy and will buy this over and over again.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and the person who got it really likes this product. She uses it quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I had no problem with the order.</li>
    <li> Love my Argan products! Great for silky hair.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for my hair. My hair is curly and I didn&#x27;t feel it did absolutely nothing to help it.</li>
    <li> it came all wrapped up so I know for sure it&#x27;s new. It works just like how I expected. I&#x27;ve previously use this product on my hair before straightening my hair, and it really works. I like the protection it offers. So I hope this will perform the same in the long run as i use this bottle, I&#x27;ll update if I find this to be fake or a counterfeit from the real product.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel silky smooth without making it look greasy.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Smells great. Great instant shine. You just need a quick short mist. And don&#x27;t spray too close to your head, it will look too greasy on your hair. I like to spray and let dry a few minutes then brush thru my hair. Will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this type oil for quite some time.  Amazon&#x27;s price seems to be the best as I&#x27;ve shopped around.&lt;br /&gt;You  use it sparingly and it does the trick.  I use hot rollers so I hit the ends up with a spray and it keeps me soft and bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;A bottle goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I have very dry and long hair, and I always look for ways to put more moisture in it.  My hair also tends to frizz when it is humid out.  This morning I  used this spray for the first time after I washed my hair, and I really noticed a difference.  My hair is softer, no frizz and looks great.  I used it with all my other products, just added it to what I already use, and saw a difference.  Simply spray some on your wet hair, and then dry it or proceed with what you usually do, and you will see a difference.  I highly recommend it if you have dry, damaged or frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  My first use of Argan oil was from a salon. Moroccan oil was pretty expensive but I liked what it did for my hair.  I found this product at a fraction of the price. My hair is so soft and shiny.  The fine mist spray is a nice touch.  I prefer it to using drops in my hands.  I use no other styling products. I used to have course, frizzy, dry hair.</li>
    <li> Best argan oil mist -- I like it so much better than the serums...and beats paying full price for the fancy stuff!</li>
    <li> I used to use a much more expensive brand from my salon but this is much cheaper and works just as well. My hair dries faster, feels softer and is much smoother. Money very well spent.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing!!! My hair is half natural half relaxed and 75% damaged. Whenever I would flat iron my hair it would look like a fried mess. I wanted something that would give my hair that shine and bounce without weighing it down. while visiting my local hair supply store this product was recommended to me. I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work because I have tried just about every product there is. But I thought, what the hell, I might as well give it a try. OMG I put just a spritz on each section and my hair looks amazing. I got the shine the bounce and my hair feels super soft. I def recommend this product. It isn&#x27;t overpriced and a little def goes a long way.</li>
    <li> LOVE WHAT ITS DONE FOR MY HAIR, I WILL PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN</li>
    <li> This Argan oil spray is amazing stuff and does wonders for my hair.  A little goes a long way with my short hair but it leaves my hair super shiny and soft. Love, love, love this product!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried and used many hair care products, but Argan oil is awsome, and it leave your hair smelling wonderful. Yes, it costs a little more, but its worth it.... I would recommend this product in a heart beat.  Ruby</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!  I used too much the first day, it left my hair a little too oily.  I only need about 6-8 spritz per day...  I tend to over style my hair between the blow drying and the flat iron... my hair always dries out ealily. This product keeps my hair super soft.. with no frizz.  This stuff has been awesome!  I was paying $50+ for Argan oil products before I found this one.  This is a keeper!</li>
    <li> This thing is literally the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used for my hair. It&#x27;s very humid where I live, so my hair gets frizzy very easily, and this controls frizz SO MUCH! I spray it on my entire hair after I wash it and it leaves my hair feeling smooth and soft. I love this product.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I use it to condition my hair and also protect it when I use my flat iron to straighten out my waves.  The spray makes it convenient and easy to use and distribute on to my hair.  Get a bottle ant try it yourself!</li>
    <li> My hair dresser told me about this spray  and she was right - it makes my hair feel amazing and does not leave it feeling oily!</li>
    <li> This is a very cheap liquid product.&lt;br /&gt;I wont be buying another.</li>
    <li> I used the Argan Oil for many years and love it.  This spray is so much easier to use and does not weigh hair down.  I use it right out of the shower, it cuts down on dry time and leaves hair silky soft.  I use it after I am done styling my hair to keep fly aways tame all day long.</li>
    <li> Why spend twice the $$. This product is lightweight yet completely covers every strand of hair.  Great for untangling and for humid weather protection.  Not a spray, but a mist that gets the job done without using a great amount.</li>
    <li> This Oil is so light i just had to buy more. My kid n i only use Argan Oil And our hair is growing. This is also good for curly hair.</li>
    <li> This oil spray is very pleasant smelling. It seems to be helping my very fine, damaged hair, along with some coconut oil treatments. I&#x27;ve been using this every day. I spray it on towel dried hair, as evenly as possible. (My one complaint is the sprayer concentrates the oil a bit much to one spot.) I brush it through and style. Sometimes I lightly spray a couple finishing spritzes on the ends and comb through in order to distribute as evenly as possible, that way it makes my hair shiny without looking oily.</li>
    <li> My sister and my daughter loved this after I purchased this for them, my daughters hair is really beautiful and shiny and makes her hair smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> Apparently, this stuff is the bees knees, so you should get it. My girlfriend swears by it.</li>
    <li> This product is great for dry hair.  It can leave your hair pretty greasy and you have to wash it daily if you use this product.  It&#x27;s great for updos and after blow drying.  I don&#x27;t recommend it if you have oily hair.</li>
    <li> Light, non-oily and easy to layer (like foundation).  99.9% of hair products applied after washing seem to leave a heavy / oily mess in my hair but this product works extremely well, it&#x27;s light but effective and it&#x27;s very hard to over apply.</li>
    <li> Smells nice! You do not need much of this product for application. I used it for my hair in the dry weather.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how much I love this product!  I spray it everywhere on my head except the roots..... and my hair is so Shiny soft &amp; silky without the greasy effect! On my third time ordering the product.....</li>
    <li> I usually use argan oil from a bottle, but thought I&#x27;d give the spray a try. My hair is wavy and somewhat coarse and this spray wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;enough&amp;#34; for my hair. I bet this would work well on finer hair. But if you are accustomed to slathering on the oil, this spray probably won&#x27;t cut it for you.</li>
    <li> Bought this after my hair stylist suggested it. The best stuff ever! Really fine mist, leaving your hair not saturated in oil, but still heat protected, and leaving a beautiful shine!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Makes my hair smell good and leaves it so shiny!! I bought two bottles. So much cheaper to buy it online than in store!</li>
    <li> I love this spray. It&#x27;s a great finishing/smoothing product after I&#x27;ve just finished curling my hair. I just pump once on top of my head and on each side and run my fingers through my hair and it gives my hair the perfect shine and it absorbs quickly, not too oily. I am Filipino/Spanish/Portuguese and have thick, coarse curly hair and it pumps just the right amount of spray. I use a thicker serum for my ends since they need a heavier product but for a finishing spray that leave your hair soft and lush, this rocks!</li>
    <li> I have used this product several times before and loved it. My hairstylist ran out so I ordered some more. It has made my hair so oily and greasy looking. I have used it three times now since I ordered trying to use just 2 or 3 sprays. I am having the same oily issue. Not sure if it is the correct product in the bottle.???</li>
    <li> Great Argan oil in a convenient spray applicator.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this and the sheen it gives my hair.  This is my favorite Argan Oil spray as I have found other brands to be oily or not as pleasantly scented.</li>
    <li> Meh.  I expected better from One n&#x27; Only.</li>
    <li> I love this product... use it all the time</li>
    <li> Great product for the price, light feel and atractive smell, good for curly and straight hair, I use after my WEN, perfect combo.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair shiny and smells great!  I use this with my keratin bond extentions and it works wonders for me.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product and will order more when it runs out. It is very good for my long hair and it makes it shiny and soft. Will continue to use it and will order more....</li>
    <li> good makes hair soft and shine</li>
    <li> Where do I start? This product is amazing! I have been using this for about 5 months to half a year now, and I absolutely love it. My hair is always to silky and shiny! Most sprays that are supposed to make your hair silky and free of frizz make my hair oily, but this doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s different than all of the other sprays I&#x27;ve used. I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone who needs frizz control, extra shine, a flat-iron spray, heat protection spray, or just some additional silk.</li>
    <li> This is excellent.  I bought some 199% pure argan oil after reading all the rave reviews about it, but let me tell you, it&#x27;s way too greasy.  This is just perfect.  Spray it on for an excellent shine.  It&#x27;s a little heavy for me for using as a pre-treatment for my flat iron or hair dryer.  Only gave 4 stars since one pump came that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I like this but I don&#x27;t love it per say for the simple fact that it made my hair too oily and stiff. I expected something lighter and I also noticed my eyes burn when I use this stuff on my hair. I am natural and I use oils, sprays, and other types of products daily which has never done this to my eyes. I use it but I don&#x27;t use it on the roots of my hair I use it on my ends now and comb or brush it through.</li>
    <li> I just love this product. It really works into my damaged hair due to rebonding. It makes my hair looks shiny and soft and smooth. Its really a miracle for me</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily at all which is why I wanted to give the spray a try versus the actual oil. Definitely would recommend</li>
    <li> I am glad to say that the other reviewers were indeed correct in giving this product great reviews. I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s ingredients being all-natural, but I can certainly affirm it&#x27;s effectiveness in bringing soft, silkiness to hair. I am in a transition stage, going &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34;, and my hair has been very dry and tangly. Since I began using this product a few days ago, my hair instantly became healthy feeling again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to make a point to laud its LOVELY SCENT. In fact, as I was sitting here at my computer writing and working, I kept sniffing my hair with joy, until I decided I would go ahead and give it a great review on Amazon. When I was looking to make the purchase, I had hoped someone would try to describe the smell, but I didn&#x27;t find it. I shall attempt to describe it now: earthy, warm, like sweet toasted coconut on a banana cream pie. It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like a tanning lotion as my description might sound, but more like warm vanilla cookies baking in the fall. Whatever it is, it smells great, and it&#x27;s relaxing and subtle enough not to be overwhelming at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now going to purchase the 3-pack and make this a daily part of my hair care.</li>
    <li> If you want shiny hair.</li>
    <li> I am bleaching my hair and it feels like it is about to disintergrate it is getting so crispy when dry and stretchy when wet! And all I ever wanted was lucious blond hair, what nature should have given me... It worked to get my hair moisted again for combing/styling but it then evaporates leaving my hair back in its brittle dry state. I&#x27;ve had to get leave-in conditioners to keep it \\&quot;glued\\&quot; together for the daily haul.</li>
    <li> Smelled nice&lt;br /&gt;Expected to give me better result, especially since i use it for more than a month..&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will bought it again</li>
    <li> gives my hair just the right extra moisture it needs</li>
    <li> I started using this regularly about a month or so ago, and it&#x27;s great for when you need a quick fix to manage frizz and dryness.</li>
    <li> Argon is oily - That&#x27;s not a bad thing. Its good for the hair ; )</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, but it&#x27;s way overpriced!  Looking for something comparable, for less money. Any suggestions?  Argan Oil is great!!!!</li>
    <li> Just tried it once and I like the results, and it is not heavy. You only need a little and the size is generous this product is great as a shampoo and conditioner. I also purchased the mousse and I will review that one when I use it.</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair and also on my face. (go easymore coomes out in a spritz than you wouls think for. a little goes a log way..</li>
    <li> This product is amazing for dry, frizzy looking hair.  Gives a beautiful sheen, without looking oily.,  Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I bought this spray oil about 1.5 year ago in Ulta. I have a fine hair, bleached. I can&#x27;t tell that this product is amazing because it makes my hair a little bit brighter. I wouldn&#x27;t bye this again.</li>
    <li> Good product, comparable to Morrocan Oil that I normally use, in a mist form. I will have to get used to the difference in the spray, and change my technique a bit, but when you figure in the price difference, I think I will be changing to this product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, spray bottle broken and to return I have to pay for postage:/</li>
    <li> Love love love it....just want a larger bottle....goes too fast!</li>
    <li> I use as a frizz control and it&#x27;s amazing. Prefect for humid weather. I get compliments all the time on how great my hair smells.</li>
</ol>
