<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> good price and good functionality.&lt;br /&gt;Braun as always give us items very efficient  suitable for each kind of female necessity</li>
    <li> I only used this twice. This thing hurts so bad!! Do your research before buying. Did have fast shipping and no issues receiving the product though.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to using an epilator after years of shaving.  Not having to use it as often sounded great to me.  Sometimes I tweeze the hairs on my legs so I already had a general idea of how it might feel .  The epilator works only when plugged in and turned out not to be as wonderful as I thought it would be.  I&#x27;ve used it several times now and I have more ingrown hairs compared to when I would shave.  I am probably not using appropriate exfoliating methods to remedy this.  At this point I can&#x27;t tell if the hairs on my legs are growing back darker or lighter.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s making much of a difference there.  I still feel the need to use it at least 3x&#x27;s a weeks because of missed stray hairs and I suspect that some are not pulled at the root and are therefore growing back faster.  I would not recommend using this epilator on your armpits.  I tested a small area and it was painful, cut my skin and made me bleed.  I still like the product and am curious as to how efficient the braun epilator with double the amount of tweezers works in comparison.  It is noisy.  I like that I don&#x27;t have to be in the bathroom to use it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product, read the instructions and followed them. Product did not remove the hairs, had to repeat the steps many many times. Was not a great purchase..</li>
    <li> It does it&#x27;s job, but doesn&#x27;t quite do the job as thoroughly. I use this to epilate my legs, and it often won&#x27;t pick up maybe 10% of the hair so I&#x27;ll take a few minutes to tweeze what&#x27;s left. It&#x27;s not even just fine hairs, I think it&#x27;s probably because the head doesn&#x27;t pivot. In the future, will probably invest in an epilator with more tweezers/flexible head. All other aspects are great though</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt that much once you get used to it (I use a zig-zag pattern so I don&#x27;t overstress one part of my skin)</li>
    <li> My first epilator, ever. I like that the hair grows back a lot slower than with shaving. Plus it&#x27;s softer- I find I&#x27;m not driven crazy by the prickly hairs like I was when I forgot to shave for a day. I purchased an epilator because, like I said, I have to shave daily and I HATED it. Razors are expensive and so is shaving cream (so are epilators, but they, at least, last a long time). I figured epilating would be more efficient and better in the long run. It did hurt at first, but now, 8 months after my first session, it doesn&#x27;t really hurt at all (taking a painkiller does help, though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-nice color&lt;br /&gt;-corded; can&#x27;t run out of battery&lt;br /&gt;-the massage/efficiency cap is nice for beginners&lt;br /&gt;-does as promised; removes hairs form the root&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-takes A LONG TIME. I epilate my legs and armpits once a week and my shortest time so far is ~45 minutes. From what I&#x27;ve gathered, that&#x27;s a pretty long time for epilation. This model has a small head and only 20 tweezers, so I get why it takes so long, but it is kind of annoying. I&#x27;m upgrading to another model mostly because of the time consumption. If you only want to do armpits or other small areas with this, go for it. Otherwise, be aware that it&#x27;ll take a while to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;-LOUD. Like really annoyingly so. I live with 5 other people in a college suite and I have to wait for all of them to be gone to do this to avoid them being irritated by the noise. It&#x27;s not at all subtle, so skip this if that&#x27;s a concern for you.&lt;br /&gt;-can break hairs if you move it too fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good first epilator. It gets the job done. But I wouldn&#x27;t use it on big areas- it just takes way too long.</li>
    <li> Simply great! Dose the work efficiently, certainly good choice.</li>
    <li> Very Happy with my purchase, recommended to anyone who is looking for a good epilator</li>
    <li> I never thought hair-removal could feel so satisfying!  Yes, it hurts, but it hurts so good!  I&#x27;d recommend that novices begin with a patch on their calf, pulling the skin tight.  I found it especially pleasing to see all the little hairs that had been yanked out, and I haven&#x27;t had to shave since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro-tip:  Use coconut oil on the skin after treatment;  it helps take any sting/itch out and it&#x27;s very nourishing (and chemical-free).</li>
    <li> Who here remembers the epilady with the coils of doom? I think I was in my late teens when my mom got one and I gave it a try, I still remember screaming in pain as it tore out my hairs (and if I remember correctly some skin too) that thing was a devil and I never touched it again. While I don&#x27;t have a huge tolerance for pain I&#x27;m not a total wuss either, I pluck my own eyebrows and I&#x27;ve used the home wax kits for other more sensitive areas w/o too much fuss. I&#x27;ve remembered those coils of doom though and never tried another epilator until this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silk-Epil, in it&#x27;s cute little package and soft pastel colors evokes thoughts of warm fuzzies magically leaving your legs, there are no coils of doom here... just tweezers, I have no issues with tweezers and they even say gentle removal and massaging rollers. Ok I thought, I&#x27;ll try this again... I hate shaving so this sounds awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They Lied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I take that back, as an epilator it removes hair wonderfully, if you can stomach the absolute torture of using the thing. It hurts, no... let me rephrase that... IT HURTS!!!!!! I first tested it out on my leg, I screamed and cracked up at the pain it hurt so bad. I was laughing because I couldn&#x27;t believe something so cute and little could cause so much mind searing pain. When my husband got home from work I insisted he try it, he put it to his arm for a second, screamed like a little girl and also cracked up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sat collecting dust for a week, then I decided I could take the pain... for my toes, yeah yeah you know you have toe hair too ladies and I always forget to shave it so I thought this would be perfect, so far so good. For some reason I can take the toe pain, I&#x27;ve even started easing it up my ankles a bit. It still hurts but now that I&#x27;ve accepted it&#x27;s going to hurt like crazy I seem able to do it a bit more. If all goes well by fall I should have hair free ankles LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you fully know what to expect pain wise from an Epilator or if you don&#x27;t dismiss my warning and are fully ready to accept the pain then this little machine does work great. It doesn&#x27;t pull anything but your hairs, my skin is safe (even on my little toes) and the light is a nice touch and helps you really see what you&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ve been warned :)</li>
    <li> I own an older version of this Silk Epil and was hoping that this one would be better, and although I do like it, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any improvements. The product works well, removing hair by pulling it out, rather than cutting it. Yes, it is a bit painful, but the more you use it, the less pain you will feel. My teenage daughter also uses it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model also features a light, which is useful, because you are less likely to miss stray hairs (I had one without a light, and would also miss a lot.) If you are looking for an epilator, I would recommend this brand, but if you want to upgrade from the old model, don&#x27;t waste your money, it&#x27;s just a different color.</li>
    <li> Good product but I think it is a shaver</li>
    <li> Hurts and causes some ingrown hairs but does a great job removing hair.</li>
    <li> I love this epilator.  It is my second one.  The first one stopped working after about 2 years.  I have found that the razors that are corded give you a much better performance than the cordless ones.  This particular version didn&#x27;t come with the electric shaver attachment that I got the first time I purchased this device.  However it is compatible with the old shaving head so if you are replacing and old one, hang on to your accessories to see if they will still work.</li>
    <li> The Braun Se3170 Silk-Epil Epilator is a beautiful well crafted machine but looks really intimidating at first, but once you start using it and don&#x27;t think about if it will cause you a great deal of pain you will enjoy the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep reading about the pain, but maybe since I was terrified and had this idea that I was going to be in such great pain that when I finally built up the courage to use the epilator it didn&#x27;t hurt that much. I used this under my arms and the result are great. I usually have to shave under my arms every two weeks but after using the Braun Se3170 Silk-Epil Epilator I have now extended that to once a month. The hair that goes grow back seems to be getting a little finer and I&#x27;m hoping that this continues until the hair finally stops growing under there all together.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this but so far not so much...it is the most painfull hair removal technique I have used to date. By the way I have used allot of different methods and consider my self to be above average for tolerating pain...yet this is an annoying, intense, repetative bee like stinging experience the short cord also sucks. That being said I will try to use this again maybe it something you can grow accustomed to?</li>
    <li> It is a normal epilator, I was expecting more... It does not have any bag..... And it just have 1 set....</li>
    <li> Very practical.&lt;br /&gt;Despite having one head, it is very efficient.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my skin very smooth. I recommend this model.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to review this because it&#x27;s really just my body that is reacting badly. Let me lay it out for you.&lt;br /&gt;It hurts. This is not for the faint of heart.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a long time to get a smooth, hairless surface.&lt;br /&gt;If your skin is sensitive/prone to ingrown hairs, it *may* take you 6 months before your follicles have recovered, like me.&lt;br /&gt;Also your hair might grow back super quickly even still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is excruciatingly painful to use this on your arms. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my old one stopped working which I have used for more than 11 years. However, this one should be improvement to older version but it doesn&#x27;t even matches the quality of work. I miss using my older one. This one does the job but not as nicely as old one.</li>
    <li> I am a veteran epilator, and have owned a different Braun epilator for about 8 years now.  That one has more bells and whistles than this one.  This one has just the epilation head.  It does not have the shaver head or the long hair trimmer cap that goes with it.  Which I think you need if you are a beginning epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model has a little light that shines on the area you are working on, which is nice.  It may or may not be bright enough to make a huge difference, but it&#x27;s probably better than nothing.  The epilator head has 20 tweezers on it. What these do is spin around, and yank out your hairs.  I would recommend a higher end model, the Braun Silk-Epil 5 which has a lot more goodies.  That one comes with a cooling glove, the shaver head and long hair trimmer cap as I mentioned before, a storage bag, and has 40 tweezers on the epilating head.  It&#x27;s less than $20 more than this model, so if you are going to be using this for any length of time I say go for the better model.</li>
    <li> First of all, I have had two major abdominal surgeries with 23 inches of scars to prove it.  So I know what pain is. Well, obviously this is nothing by comparison, but be prepared. I thought that I would give this to my Asian fianc&amp;eacute;e to try since they don&#x27;t have much hair anyway. She refused, so I said don&#x27;t be such a wus. So I decided to demonstrate that it wasn&#x27;t painful by ripping a few hairs off the underside of my left arm. After all, there wasn&#x27;t much hair there anyway. I have severe neck pain, so I already had a strong prescription oxycodone pain pill at work. Son of a gun! That felt like lightning hit my arm.  I&#x27;m not kidding. I&#x27;m an electrical engineer so I&#x27;ve been shocked a few times in my life.  But I think it was just the shock of hair coming out rather abruptly. Good thing epilators weren&#x27;t available during Medieval times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got to hand it to any woman who can handle this. I&#x27;m a complete wus it seems. So reluctantly I just tried it again. OMG!  It did a great job of yanking out the hair - not one single hair remains in a two inch by one inch patch of skin on my arm. People ask why I have a big patch of hair missing on my arm now.  It is still completely hairless after a week.  I can&#x27;t decide whether to give it 5 stars for hair removal or 1 star for pain.  So I decided to go middle way.</li>
    <li> I had the same in france. Very cheap and convenient. It doesn&#x27;t forget any hair. However, i don&#x27;t recommend for those who are over sensitive to pain. I Generally shave my armfit with but its painfull</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this epillator for quite a few months now. It is my first, so I&#x27;m not always sure if I&#x27;m using it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it was fine. It still works.</li>
    <li> I was tired of shaving and didn&#x27;t want to constantly pay for waxing so I bought this. I was hesitant since I had purchased a shaving machine before that did not work at all. I am pretty sensitive to pain but this was not as bad as expected. It has worked amazing for me. Hair growth has slowed tremendously and my hair already grew back thinner. I use it on my legs, arms, armpits. I tried to remove body hair on my stomach and was cut so be careful on the more supple parts of your body. I also tried to remove pubic hair with this but it hurt too much. Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: exfoliate! I&#x27;ve gotten a few ingrown hairs even with exfoliation so after epilating, check for some hairs and get them with a tweezer.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this model. I&#x27;ve been using a Braun epilator for years and my previous one had lasted more than 6. I got this one though and from the first time I used it it took many more redos to get all of the hair off.</li>
    <li> I bought this item a few months ago, and I bought this based on the review, however, I would not recommend this item, it doesn&#x27;t do to work, you have to shave at least twice a week and I don&#x27;t have much hair on my legs.  Now I am trying to return this item if I can. NOT RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> sharp on the skin, scratched my legs, does pull hair out. could be a problem with this product only. would like to exchange it.</li>
    <li> Love it, it is easy to use and the price is excellent compared to other places I window shopped at.</li>
    <li> These Braun devices last forever! In fact, my previous hadn&#x27;t stopped working, the motor was just slowing down a bit after about ten years. I didn&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles of the lastest version and was pleased to find this model on Amazon&#x27;s site at a great price.</li>
    <li> It hurts but super fast to get the hair out. Getting the angle is hard, once you figure it out it will be more smooth.</li>
    <li> Yanking hair out by the root is a painful experience. I tried it on my arm before giving it to my 18 yr old daughter to try on her legs. On my arm it felt like a series of electrostatic shocks. I suppose this could be fun for sado-masochists, but for me it was not something I wanted to repeat, even though it&#x27;s supposed to get less painful each time. My daughter had a somewhat more dramatic, knee-jerk-type reaction, as she threw it against the wall. She also did not want to repeat the process to see if it gets less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The advantage of an epilator is that when the hair grows back the tip is soft. Shaving leaves a sharp edge that can cause ingrown hairs, plus a short-term growth is scratchy. Not so with the epilator. After a couple of days the hair is visible but totally soft and not scratchy at all. But you must suffer through it, unless you have access to a topical analgesic or some good opiates, or just like pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people know that an epilator hurts, so I didn&#x27;t rate it down for that. I rated it down because it did only a mediocre job of getting all the hair. Even after several passes over a 6-inch strip of my arm, I counted 10 hairs that it could not pull. Braun makes several models and apparently this one is at the bottom. Certainly this epilator beats out manual plucking, but if you really want a quality product that performs better and is more convenient to use (like cordless?) then I recommend looking elsewhere.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend has been using this and finds it the most comfortable wayto remove unwanted hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since she&#x27;s used this, she has eliminated the need for daily shaving. She has had the experience of trying different electric hair removal systems, but had found them too painful and irritating to continue using and always returned to using a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having leg hair growing in a more fine texture is another plus. The 20 tweezer rollers massage the skin and loosen the pores allowing easier hair removing without a real \\&quot;pulled out feeling.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Smartlight lets you see and find lighter, shorter body hair. It removes hair at the root and the area of skin can be smooth and hair free up to a month. It even removes hair which lays smooth across the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the comfort and efficiency, five stars.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, simple, and works great! I did my underarms and didn&#x27;t have to do it again for a while. this is a great buy!</li>
    <li> I had problems with the delivery but overall it was ok.</li>
    <li> I am giving it 1 star because I can&#x27;t give it 0! Here is my experience: - It is not efficient in taking out all the hairs. You have to go over the same area over and over and over again. Even then, it does not remove all hairs. - You hair can&#x27;t be too long, it can&#x27;t be too short! - I read some online blogs saying the skin should be exfoliated before epilation, etc. etc.. I tried all the tips. Nothing improved. - It takes a very long time and at the end of it, I didn&#x27;t feel the time was well used because there were so many hairs left. - MOST IMPORTANTLY, it gave me a lot of ingrown hairs, a lot. It took months of painstaking tweezing to get them all out, not to mention discontinuation of this product.  I bought this from Amazon for $40 and it was a waste of money! For prospective customers, I&#x27;d suggest go for a different company or a better, pricier model.</li>
    <li> As a man with sparse (but bothersome) back hair, this epilator works well.  Even on the fastest speed there is only minimal discomfort, and it removes most hairs completely with only a single pass.  Hair grows much far slower than shaving, too.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this for any guy looking to eliminate pesky back / neck hair.  Just be sure to enlist your significant other to help you out, otherwise you may end up with zebra stripes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the chord - I wish it was a bit longer!</li>
    <li> The express was owsome, well tracked and delivered on schedule. The shaver works ok, but not as clean as I expected.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator so I have nothing to compare it to but I think this is a good one. The light on it is perfect and the cored is a great length. I looked at battery operated one&#x27;s too because people talked about using these in the shower but now that I&#x27;ve tried it I wouldn&#x27;t ever want to use one in the shower. I bought this one because it was reviewed as being the best for bikini areas but I find it too big to get into all the nooks and crannies. However, it works well on my legs and larger areas. It doesn&#x27;t pick up every single hair but it gets the coarse stuff and following it up with a shave will get the left over little blondies leaves you smooth for a week. I love the convenience!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so good for legs it takes the hair from the roots After three times I start see how the hair grow slow</li>
    <li> I have never used an epilator before this one and had always heard that it hurts. I thought it was an exaggeration because what could hurt more than waxing right? Wrong! This hurt more than waxing but honestly after about a minute you get used to it and it doesn&#x27;t sting afterwards like waxing does. The design is quite sleek and I like that there are two speeds. My only regret is not getting one that works in water too. Overall it works great!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used an epilator and... OUCH! I used it and I put it away after mere minutes. I was not prepared for the pain! I picked it up a few days later and finished the job. Still painful, but at least I was prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about the epilator...&lt;br /&gt;Hair growth is slow. It lasts several days. It is worth using an epilator just to avoid the hassle of repeated shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about the epilator...&lt;br /&gt;The thing about this epilator is that it does not get all the hair out and you have to keep using it over and over again just to get the leg area finished. I would upgrade to the 40-tweezer epilator. It would likely be more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Wait a few minutes after using the epilator before you shower. Your legs will be very sensitive after.</li>
    <li> I am a current user of the Silk Epil 7 and I&#x27;ll be sticking with that model.&lt;br /&gt;This is a more basic model and a less effective one. It takes longer to achieve the same amount of hair removal and I had to go.over the same areas multiple times. This model seems to break off rather than pull out a higher percentage of hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pay a bit more tor the 7- I think you&#x27;ll be happier with that - I really like mine and results last weeks.</li>
    <li> My wife would not recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I ordered this one, not realizing that it didn&#x27;t have as many tweezer heads as the more premium models in this brand/ line. This is my first properly-sized epilator, and I have been using the slim Emjoi epilator for a few months with good success, except for the fact that I wish it wasn&#x27;t quite so small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have gotten to try this Braun one, I am wishing I&#x27;d taken the plunge and gotten a big one sooner. It has a weird prickly roller on it that seems to make the hairs stand up better so they can be plucked out. It&#x27;s not the most comfortable sensation, but then I&#x27;m not sure that is really why we epilate. More to the point, it is very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about a half hour to epilate both lower legs using this thing, and my legs have been smooth for a week. LOVING this! My legs didn&#x27;t feel irritated or anything, but I did certainly get a head rush when I finally stood up. This starts out being extremely painful and sensitive and dulls down to a tingling and prickling sensation with occasional \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; moments. It really helps if you pull your skin very taut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I purchase this model over another one? Honestly, I&#x27;d spend the extra dough for the model with the most heads. I feel pretty strongly that I do not want to spend my entire day epilating, and going over and over spots because of the limited number of tweezers is not my idea of fun. This would be a good model to start with and see if you actually use it, but if you like it, you&#x27;ll wish you&#x27;d gotten the model up from this with twice as many tweezer heads. I&#x27;d just jump straight to that and skip this one unless you really can&#x27;t afford to get the better one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Comparing it to the Emjoi, I liked the roller head on this Braun one as I felt it helped the epilator be more effective at grabbing the hairs. Both seemed equally effective at actually epilating once they were able to grab the hairs.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m afraid I just don&#x27;t have the patience for this product. The instructions state that several seconds should be spent on each swipe. The surface area of the epilator is quite small so it takes more time than I want to spend to get my legs done. It wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if each swipe actually removed the hairs beneath it, but it has to be done more than once, no matter how slowly the device is moved across the skin. The good news is that once out, the hairs do not grow back for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, it didn&#x27;t seem as painful as it did to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light clearly illuminates the missed hairs and, sadly, there were just too many of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product would be better for smaller areas, like the face, although this particular model is recommended for legs. It does, however, work just fine on the face and is a good alternative to waxing, tweezing, or cream hair removers.</li>
    <li> I used to own the same Silk Epil Braun for the past 6 years. Nothing was wrong with it, but when I moved to the US I decided to purchase a new one and when I found this one in such a good price I did it. BEST decision ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;It requires 1/3 of the time the old one needed and the light is super helpful.</li>
    <li> Hi!&lt;br /&gt;I like the product but I have two major complaints:&lt;br /&gt;1. It does not remove the hair that is short. So, you have to wait until it appears to remove the hair.&lt;br /&gt;2. My skin is not soft at all. My pores are bulky, apparently embodied, and that never happened to me before.</li>
    <li> Had braun product for a long time, but a old version of the same. Love this one. better and faster!</li>
    <li> Is there pain the first time-yes. but if you take a couple anti inflammitories about 2 hours before hand it really isnt that big of a deal. Also if you are consistently epilating about once a week it is very easy to manage hair growth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my legs twice now. It does an okay job. I have to remind myself to go very, very slowly, or it misses hairs - even on the high setting. It hurts, but I took another reviewer&#x27;s advice and started in the calf area and that does seem to help. It is nice to not have to worry about shaving my legs for a few weeks. I cannot imagine using it anywhere else. I&#x27;ve wondered if perhaps using it in a warm room or in front of a space heater might help with the pain - opening of the pores from the heat - but I haven&#x27;t tried it. I would recommend it to a friend who has a high pain tolerance.</li>
    <li> Works very well. The results last for about month.</li>
    <li> The LED light is great and very helpful.  I have had many other epilators in the past and this one pulls my skin more (leaves a little burn rash almost) in sensitive areas than others.  I really have a hard time with it on my knees as well.  It just can&#x27;t get a clean hair removal on boney knee caps.  I tend to just avoid those areas with this one and use a different one (my older one, different brand).  This one is fine for legs and arms, just beware when doing knees and bikini area.</li>
    <li> Very good epilator. I don&#x27;t feel that much pain. I used an old one and this is a huge difference. Yes, there are some hair left or even some broken insted of pulled but not a big issue. My skin gets red but it is ok after 2-3 hours. The light is very usefull. I would recomend it. I used it in other areas, not just legs and it worked fine.</li>
    <li> I like It because its work really perfect and smooth l recommended it to buy and l get very fast</li>
    <li> Works amazing!! It&#x27;s always a bit painful in the beginning, but I&#x27;ve had it for about two months and there&#x27;s no problems.</li>
    <li> This is my first epilator and it met my expectations. It is great for beginners and the purple rollers are great so the epilator does not grasp the skin.</li>
    <li> great quality. great speed. easy to use. hurts a little but not much, u can get use to it. thx</li>
    <li> It is very loud and it doesn&#x60;t take away those fine hair. I needed to run it over the same area multiple times in order to even remove thick and long hair.  It only has 20 tweezers, so I would recommend one that has 40 tweezers. The fact that it is not on battery, but has a chord, makes it more difficult to use. If you want to buy an epilator, you might as well buy one you can use in the shower, to ease the pain.</li>
    <li> The Braun Epilator is more than what I expected. I have been using an epilator for several years, but this one is much better than the one I was using before. It gets the very, very short hair as well as the longer hair and it fits very comfortable in my hand and with the light on it, I can see if I missed any. It is a great product.</li>
    <li> I figured I would give this a try, not having every used this kind of hair removal process I was not sure what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions were simple and I turned it on to try and use it on my legs but my god did it ever HURT! I have had my legs waxed with less pain than this thing. Also since this item is not cordless you need to sit near an outlet to use it which is not very effective. But even that was not as bad as the pain using this item caused, once was enough in fact I could not even finish using it on my leg it hurt so badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No thank you!</li>
    <li> I must admit I was always a bit afraid of trying an epilator.  The horror of ripping all those tiny hairs out at once, shudder!  I&#x27;m very happy to report that it wasn&#x27;t really that bad at all.  A little pinching but nothing too awful.  Nothing like some reviewers have you believe.  This worked quickly with a few simple passes.  The light is very bright which I found helpful to spot the pesky stray hairs.&lt;br /&gt;It has 2 speeds, however I&#x27;m not sure..... ?Why I would use this on the lower speed?.....pulling hair quickly hurts a bit, but slow down the process...why?&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very happy with this epilator and will continue to use this on my legs, and on a brave day may try other areas, but I&#x27;m not that brave today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best tips I can offer are : Be sure to hold the skin tight to avoid pinching and only use this on clean, DRY skin, then moisturize when finished.</li>
    <li> My wife reviewed this item for me. Her comments were very positive.  This epilator is very strong to the point that even after three weeks her legs were still smooth.  It handles very smoothly, and does not irritate her skin. Furthermore, it is very easy to clean.  She had an earlier model by the same brand and says the new one is a clear improvement.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The moment I tried this product, I fell in love. It is perfect for legs, and arms. I still recommend wax for the bikini area, and arm pits. It WILL rip at your skin in those areas. For your legs, after a few uses, I found that the hair grows back a lot slower, and your legs and arms stay softer longer. If you want CRAZY soft legs, you can shave after using it too, like before a date or something. I tell every girl friend I have about this, and just about all of them have either gotten one, or try mine, and usually fall in love at first use. Just, once again, stick to wax for more &#x27;sensitive&#x27; areas.</li>
    <li> Razors and razor burns are the worst for me. The concept of a razor coming toward my skin scares me. No shaving for me.  I&#x27;ve been waxing and using depilatories and sugaring and sugaring strips for years. Waxing is extremely time consuming and not really cost effective (I go to the salon for this as I&#x27;m not skilled enough to be effective). Nads can be messy and doesn&#x27;t grip all of my fine hair. Both of those methods need the hair to be longer to grasp and you have to wait until hair is intolerably long.  That makes me nuts.  There are some very good depilatories on the market, but they can be messy and one gets regrowth as quick as the next day or two. So depilatories are \\&quot;much to do about nothing\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone put the idea of a epilator in my head and not wanting to wait, I went to the local Walmart to see if I could find it cheap, as I didn&#x27;t want to invest in an unknown devise. I was charged tax and it was fifty bucks. So if you&#x27;re more patient that I, it would be smarter to purchase this devise through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this is the \\&quot;lower end\\&quot; of the Braun epilators, this thing is very good. Yes, I have to pass over my skin a couple of times to get all of the hair but my answer to this; so what? This isn&#x27;t messy, but you have to vacuum up the hair that&#x27;s pulled out. It&#x27;s preferable that hair is shorter not longer like the waxing or sugaring. The reason for this is if the devise pulls longer hair there&#x27;s a  greater risk of them breaking off of causing ingrown hairs. It doesn&#x27;t hurt, it tugs. Maybe all of that waxing and sugaring has made me less susceptible to that type of pain. From my distant memories it far less painful than a couple of days of a nick or razor burns. It has grasped and removed the finer hair on my body. I have to admit that I was surprised by that because waxing and sugaring doesn&#x27;t do that well. I do get some minor red spots. I&#x27;m not sure if this is from pulling hair by the root or ingrown hairs or if this is where  my skin has been pinched by the devise. That doesn&#x27;t matter, because it goes away pretty much overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I figure out which one I want and which one does total body, I will upgrade to a wet/dry version from Braun. Braun products have served me well and I have a twenty year old coffee bean grinder that still works like a charm. So I know that in the past, Braun mean quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some tips to help with the complaints that I&#x27;ve read from epilators:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure that there is no residue from lotion or antiperspirant on skin. With this one, make sure that your skin is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchase and use one of those exfoliating mitts or a pair of gloves. These things are cheap and can be found at any local pharmacy or discount retailer. Use them every time you bathe. I also use body scrub and I use a dry body brush too. My skin is very well exfoliated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchase witch hazel, which it very cheep and can be purchased anywhere. Apply witch hazel to the areas after using the epilator. This really does seem to reduce red bumps or make them go away quicker. Wait for the stuff to dry and absorb into the skin prior to dressing (about five minutes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive, white skin with very fine hair on most of my body. If one has coarser hair, I bet this would work better, but one might be a a higher risk of ingrown hairs. Just exfoliate and make sure that the hair growth and length is minimal. Pain? No way, I jam my feet into five inch heals for beauty and work out to a point of pain at the health club. A little epilator is not going to bug me. I&#x27;m a small business owner, with a grade school child and a big house that needs repairs. Time is at a premium for me. I&#x27;ve saved a couple of hours every so often going to the salon, not to mention $50 and a tip for waxing and Brazilian waxing. Thank you BRAUN!</li>
    <li> i aint gonna lie this shit is painful!!!!!!! but after awhile your body gets used to it and its not so bad ive had this for 3 months now and only had to use it 3 times. it takes ALL the hair out your underarms and it doesnt grow back fully for like 3 maybe four weeks. i try to epilate again when the hair is visible but still short less painful that way instead of waiting till it fully grows back. in my opinion it wasnt as effective on legs i felt like it was just snapping the hairs instead of pulling like the underarms. i tried it on my face like the chin area that works too it was baby smooth no lie. i would definite recommend for the underarms 100 percent last way longer than shaving just use powder to keep the area from sweating while you are doing it. and after words use TENDSKIN ROLL ON (YOU CAN BUY IT ON HERE) to prevent ingrown hairs and irritation it kinda burns but it lets you know its working lol.works wonders with it my underams look so much better now than when i used to shave. smooth and soft. idk about the other people on here talkin about using it on the pubic area they are crazy. it was too painful for me when i tried it. i will never use it on pubes smh</li>
    <li> Works as expected and works even better if you get your legs waxed first and then use this two weeks later.  Then you will only have to use this about once a month - and I have VERY hairy legs.  Thee cord doesn&#x27;t get in the way and the light is helpful as well.  I did a LOT of research on epilators before I purchased this one.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> good product. fast delivery! great work!</li>
    <li> Ordered this as a gift for my sister as a replacement for another Braun unit and lasted her for a good 4-5 years. She loves these.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing...I am very excited about this purchase! This is my first time using a Epilator and I am thrilled that my purchase was a success! NO MORE STUBBLE! I did a few tests on it and so far the results have been amazing! It needs to be rolled in a specific direction (accidentally tried in opposite direction to go back over skin...not a good idea) so that it doesn&#x27;t hurt because at first it does a little...as much as it would tweezing different parts of your body. So, be sure you know it serves its purpose if you don&#x27;t mind the little pain that comes from tweezing.  It has a light on it which I think is great because you can really notice the tiny hairs and get everything. And I would suggest maybe going a little slower in areas with lots of tiny hairs to be sure to get everything. Also, this arrived in great timing!</li>
    <li> Does not provide promises made by advertisement!</li>
    <li> I was unsure whether to get this or the upgraded version I just lost somewhere, but this one works just as fine (I don&#x27;t use the razor attachment anyways) and saved be 40$. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> excellent product and easy to use recomended to anyone perfect for travel and to leave home at any time anywhere</li>
    <li> We have it more than a year and it still works as new. The price was fair enough. Totally recommended.</li>
    <li> This product is a nice one in it&#x27;s range. Easy to use and smooth work. My wife loves selected and loved it.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my sister when she came for a visit and hers got damaged. It arrived promptly and it worked great. She has been using it for the past 4 months and problems. She tells me she loves it and works better than her old one.</li>
    <li> Coming from Europe, I needed an epilator that I could use here, since the European one I have works VERY slowly in the U.S. due to voltage change. Did not want to pay more than $35 for something which is so accessible on the other side of the world. Was very glad to find a decent brand with a decent price (In-store retailers sell &amp;#34;epilators&amp;#34; for outstanding prices with very little quality). The little light comes in very handy for those smaller hairs. A little noisy and bulky but overall good product. Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Works better than the older version my wife owned before our dog decided it was a chew toy. Does a good job of getting hairs off. It does rip some off instead of pulling them out by root from time to time, but you still get smooth skin from it.</li>
    <li> This has more power than the rechargeable. If you use it for the first time it tends to pull on my hair, but the more you use it you get used to the feel it&#x27;s better than waxing or shaving.</li>
    <li> Requires a lot of patience and is slow.&lt;br /&gt; But useful for underarms and urgent needs.&lt;br /&gt; Don&#x27;t thing this can eliminate the need for waxing completely&lt;br /&gt;not good for sensitive skin very painful so go for higher model if u except a painless experience ,no cooling pad with tis so moisturise well after doing this.&lt;br /&gt;This product isn&#x27;t the best out there it hurts a in the beginning. I am not rally a fan of this product doesn&#x27;t really help me. The hair comes back after a couple of days but as time goes by the hair gets less darker. Recommend this to people who have patience and time and who can endure a little sting. Hope this helps :)</li>
    <li> I like it! Works fine, worth to it&#x27;s price. Hurts a lot at the beginning but after a couple of times you will get used to it!</li>
    <li> I got it for my wife. She is not fully satisfied though. It doesn&#x27;t remove the hairs completely and they will continue growing under the skin.</li>
    <li> i got this because i wanted to pull the hair from the root to help reduce the black dot in the hair follicle, but i would actually rather go and do laser hair removal because it is a similar type of pain for me, the laser is less pain i think because it doesnt actually pull the hair out of the follicle....its a good product if u can stand the pain so i give it three stars, functionality is actually 5 stars item works as advertised.</li>
    <li> This epilator is okay for deciding if you really want to use an epilator but if I was buying an epilator to try I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $20 for it. Of the hairs it grabs, I would say it pulls out about half &amp; breaks the other half. I know I like epilating, I just need to buy a better epilator.</li>
    <li> Works well, takes care of underarms and legs. You may have to go over the area a couple of times, but hey it beats buying razors and shaving in the shower. Make sure to exfoliate before so you don&#x27;t get ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Simple and exactly as described. If you are looking for a basic model that gets the job done, this is a great option.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product. I recommend. And shipping is also good.</li>
    <li> I want you to know....I LOVE LOVE LOVE this epilator!  The first time is a bit shocking, but it hurts LESS than a tattoo! lol  It got here sooner than I expected, and was in MINT condition!  I LOVE IT!!!!!  Thank you soooooooo much!!</li>
    <li> I bought a 7 series and after a while the header goes off. I had a Series for about 5 years and I gave it to my sister. Then I got this from new and is great! It is a &amp;#34;All Terrain&amp;#34; machine.</li>
    <li> I think its too much slow for taking off hair and remove it well&lt;br /&gt;but it still good for me&lt;br /&gt;but I think its good for legs only</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted! It works very well. Very good price. Definitely better than my first silk-epil. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased and impressed with this epilator!  It was my first epilator purchase ever and I can&#x27;t believe I am just now discovering this incredible convenience.  I tend to really hate hair on my body, because I&#x27;ve always had thick stubble and it grows quickly and even with a new razor, seeing the hair under the surface slightly darkens the skins overall complexion.  I love the look of waxing because it slightly brightens the skin since there is no hair under the surface since you&#x27;re pulling it out at the root.  So I love that this is how the skin looks after using this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it hardly missed any hairs, I only plucked a few that didn&#x27;t get plucked by the Braun.  I did both legs, arms and arm pits in one sitting in about 40 minutes.  I found it only slightly uncomfortable, but that&#x27;s because my brain loves the feeling of hair being pulled out because I don&#x27;t like having hair.  Kind of like loving the pain of a good workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light on this device is fabulous.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine using an epi without one.  The cord didn&#x27;t bother me at all and I actually rather have it plugged in so I can go forever than having to recharge something, so no complaints there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m so pleased. And after my first use only I find it so easy I already feel like a pro.  Would definitely recommend AND I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t by the most expensive Braun because this one works fantastically and is a third of the price.  :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great starter.  The light is wonderful!  Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product, the light is helpful. It&#x27;s not amazing though, because hair needs to be longer than you think...</li>
    <li> I have owned shavers of this type. This one I am not that happy with. It is not as good as my others that I have had. Because it does not shave that great.I brought a new one because of the feature of the light on it.</li>
    <li> This is product is pretty amazing &amp; genius. I was told by a friend to buy it. I was sick of going to the wax store and paying close to $100 for hair removal every 4 weeks. With this product I no longer have to do that! The hair on my body grows extremely slower and in some areas (bikini) not at all now, that I&#x27;ve used Braun&#x27;s electric tweezers. It is equivalent to getting a full brazilian wax without the cost and better quality since you can do it yourself &amp; get all the areas most waxers miss; not to mention you can do it in the privacy &amp; comfort of your own home without being embarrassed.</li>
    <li> This was the first epilator I have ever bought, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. However, I have to say that this is a good investment for those who are so done with shaving and waxing. Shaving was annoying because you would have to shave every other day. Waxing was too messy for me. With an epilator, it was so quick and easy that it was fun! I would epilate while watching TV (The sound it makes is kinda loud though). For me, the experience was virtually painless (I probably have a high pain tolerance). I was able to convince some of my friends to try it out, and they thought it was a handy tool. The only downside to this product was cleaning. Since it&#x27;s not waterproof, I couldn&#x27;t rinse the hair out. The brush that it came with helped, but it was still a hassle. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this epilator.</li>
    <li> It is a good product, but it still is not able to get all the hair out from the root. I think it does not need to be more expensive to do a better job removing hair.</li>
    <li> In my culture we have to clean armpits, and this device is perfect for this purpose, long stay effect (clean and hairless) and good quality!</li>
    <li> leaves yoyr skin smooth but of course scrub your skin before using the epilator</li>
    <li> Braun&#x27;s product always great.</li>
    <li> The device has a small surface area and hurts like hell. I honestly can&#x27;t say if there is a better one out there because this is the only one i have tried. I just use wax pads now and I find that it is painful but quick.</li>
    <li> I  own other epilator but is 210 v. It does the work. I am happy. No problems or complaints so far.</li>
    <li> Since this is my first epilator, I can&#x27;t really do a comparison but I do know that this one works very well, is easy to keep clean, and is about half the price of most others on amazon. So I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great, much much better than the cordless once, that I paid $100 for, the battery takes for ever to charge, and does not hold the charge for long time on 15 Minutes.</li>
    <li> I have used epilators for a very long time and most of them run on batteries.  This one works off of AC so I don&#x27;t have to worry about recharging or replacing batteries and was the sole purpose of purchase.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. If u wanna go cheap, go for it, but u get what u pay. Cheap execution means painful and not effective in removing hair.</li>
    <li> While a device like this comes with inherent pain that accompanies its benefits, I was presently surprised with how manageable it was.  Granted, it&#x27;s not pleasant, but it did go from not that bad to even better with subsequent use.  Alas its effectiveness never reached levels that justify it&#x27;s use, and alas it&#x27;s all but forgotten after three or so uses.  It does remove a significant amount of hair, but that&#x27;s after taking a lot of time.  It really didn&#x27;t get any better with subsequent uses, and  perhaps either a more robust model (Braun makes a few that are more capable) would be appropriate, or maybe even none at all for this individual.  Your mileage may very.</li>
    <li> Bought this in walmart for 50, tired of shaving my legs soooo i tried this. works great! i mean, it takes a while because its tweezing your hair, but i think its worth it. i did my legs and usually my hair grows back sooo fast and dark and kinda coarse too, but i&#x27;ve noticed since using this, when my hair does grow back, its thin and barely noticeable to i don&#x27;t have to use it that often. Tried on my underarms, OUCH! But I like it WAY better than shaving and LESS expensive than waxing.</li>
    <li> I feel like this product shaves more hair than it actually pulls out.</li>
    <li> hair start to grow inside your skin instead of coming out and that doesn&#x27;t look pretty at all! back to shaving!</li>
    <li> Have to go over the same area again and again.  But still it&#x27;s convenient and easy to use. Could have been a little more efficient.</li>
    <li> awful product， too painful....</li>
    <li> Braun Silk-Epil 3170 Epilator is a very handy device and can be used all over the body for convenient pain-free hair removal. It works smoothly and causes no discomfort. Also very user friendly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this epilator for 2 months now. I wanted to use it for a good while, so I could really get a chance to see how well or not it would work and gauge the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was not very impressed at all. I still am not thoroughly satisfied with it, but I haven&#x27;t given up yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First use was ok. I didn&#x27;t experience any pain. You do feel something, but it was not painful. The hair removal was so-so at best. Tons of skipped hairs, tons of broken hairs instead of plucked hairs. You have to go over the same area numerous times in numerous directions and angles. I did have bumps on my skin (all over my legs) but the bumps aren&#x27;t as bad now. I still get them, but not as much and not as red and they go away quicker. Keep in mind this is a lengthy process. You have to go over the areas very SLOWLY. It takes much more time than shaving. I can spend a good hour doing both legs. You also have to do it more than once a week and I never actually end up with smooth legs. It is nothing at all like the smoothness you feel after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first several weeks, my legs were soo dry after using the epilator. I had to moisturize much more often. My legs actually got flaky. You also have to use a very good exfoliant, wether it be a really good body scrub, or a pretty rough exfoliating mitt/loofah. Your typical mesh sponge or \\&quot;pouf\\&quot; does not exfoliate well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliation is extremely important because it removes all that dry skin of course and it also helps with the ingrown hairs and also helps the bumps. It is like you need to get that skin off in order for the hair to be able to come through again. I actually prefer to use a back scrubber brush - you know, the long handled brushes used for scrubbing your back. The bristles are pretty stiff and I have the best results with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the hair removal - since alot of the hairs were broken off instead of plucked, the hair was all coming back at different lengths. So I had different degrees of stubble going on. It was/is quite annoying, but it has gotten slightly better in the past 2 weeks actually. I found myself needing to use this epilator about 3-4 days a week because the hairs were just not disappearing and they grew back within a day or two, just like with a razor. Some of course were not long enough to use the epilator, so I had to deal with the rough legs. One night my husband rubbed my calf and actually said \\&quot;I thought you&#x27;ve been using that *thing*\\&quot;  I said \\&quot;Yea, I have...\\&quot;  The stubble was really bad and that is after spending literally hours using this *thing*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brave as I am and determined to have the results promised by epilators, I decided to do my armpits. Now here I will say \\&quot;OMG!!\\&quot;  Yes, that did hurt! I had to have my husband do it for me because I found myself stopping midstroke due to the pain. I am pretty sure he liked torturing me lol. Surprisingly though, I saw much better results in my armpits than on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several weeks of feeling like there&#x27;s gotta be a better way with this epilator, I got to thinking - what if I take this purple plastic piece off of the head (the piece with the roller bars). Quite honestly, I don&#x27;t think the roller bars give any benefit whatsoever. I have been using it without that purple piece and guess what - I have MUCH better results! It is much easier to use this way too and gets on the curves and contours MUCH better. With the purple piece on, it was SOO hard to get on and around the knee - the device was just wayyy too bulky. It is so much better now with it off, even for my legs, and especially for my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device still glides across your skin without that piece and it does not tug your skin at all. With the piece on, it would pinch my skin, especially on my armpits. It doesn&#x27;t do that at all anymore. The irritation is MUCH less and I have alot less bumps and ingrown hairs! The actual hair removal is better too. It gets more hairs with less passes and there is much less broke hairs. I really believe that purple piece does more harm than good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of now, the hair on my legs does seem to be getting lighter and thinner, although I still have to use this epilator a few times a week and it is still very time consuming. I still do not have smooth legs. Even immediately after using it, my legs do not feel smooth. Part of it is because of the little bumps that form. It is kind of like chicken skin or goose bumps 24/7, plus normal hair stubble. I keep using it though in hopes that it WILL get better. I have come to far to go back to shaving, so I will keep at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to my armpits, I see the most improvement there. The entire texture of the hair has changed for the better. I do not have irritation or ingrowns. I do have to use it a few times a week though still, just as I would have to use a razor. This does not discourage me though since I do see the hair getting much thinner and softer. I can only assume that the hair growth will slow down soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To go one step further, I even tried my bikini area and wow, yes again OUCH! First time I tried with the purple roller bar on and it was a very horrible experience for the 15 seconds I could endure it. The roller bars (they are prickly) caused more harm than good and really allow the device to pinch the skin too much. With the roller bars off, I am happy to say that I continue to epilate my bikini area and the results are really good. The hair stays away long than shaving and it is so much less painful with the purple part off. I am really happy with the results in the bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why the leg hairs are so difficult. I still have to spend so much time and doing so much \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; work on my legs to get the hairs that grow at different intervals and then to also catch the ingrowns that decide to finally come out. Like I said, I will keep up with it because I am eager to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If asked, I would probably advise getting a better device. Probably one with more tweezers. This one is ok as a starter unit I suppose, but the results are not very good for the legs at all and I am not sure that everyone will want to use it on their armpits and bikini area like I do. Also, the fact that it works better after you remove one of the main pieces, may be a sign that this unit could use some improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used an epilator before. This was my first experience. Although not totally terrible, it has not been all good either. I really hoped for better results for my legs and I hope that in more time it will pay off. I cannot stress enough how much better it really is, if you take that whole purple piece off. I have not put it back on at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will come back in a few months and update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last 2 things I will mention - the cord is long. That is very good considering all of the time it takes to use it - you will switch positions often, trying to keep comfortable. The light I could do without. I was not impressed with it. It shines around the area instead of on the area (if that makes sense). I have better luck finding all the hairs just by looking from different angles instead of by the light. It is weird.. it is like the light \\&quot;sees\\&quot; in peripheral vision instead of straight ahead on the area you are working on.s more hairs with less passes and there is much less broke hairs.

    <li> Its just awesome! ive been using braun for 10 years already and its perfect, no pain, no skin irritation, just smooth and silky feeling for 10-15 days. And the shipping was super fast! Thanks a lot!</li>
    <li> This thing does what its made to do, remove hair, but it feels like you can feel every individual hair being removed. It takes multiple passes over the same area to get it hair free and since its essentially a rolling tweezer, it hurts.</li>
    <li> I used this epilator on my legs last night with great results, however it was only accomplished with several passes. No worries though, once you get past the initial epilation (the most painful) Going back to get the stray hairs/stubble is practically painless. I noticed how some of the reviewers were commenting on broken hairs and stubble. This only happens when you move the epilator too quickly, not giving the epilator enough time to pull the hair out, so it just breaks it because it had no time to finish pulling it. I made that mistake and ended up with lots of broken hairs and stubble. Yes, it&#x27;s a lot more painful to run the epilator slowly up your leg, but when you do it this way you&#x27;ll end up with no broken hairs or stubble; if you have already done it the other way, just wait a couple of days for the hairs to grow back and do it properly. After the first hair removal session, I used the massaging rollers since the first time is the most painful, but now I do without them because the tweezers can grab the hairs a lot better, which means you wont have to pass through as many times. I suggest removing all the hair with the massing rollers attached first; then take them off and do your leg again. I can&#x27;t comment on other body parts because last night was enough pain for me. I&#x27;ll probably do my underarms and the area under my bellybutton tonight. And yes, it&#x27;s way loud.</li>
    <li> Works well, like the light,  worth it.</li>
    <li> Oh my - OUCH! The reviews were actually pretty good overall for this product so I am a bit surprised at how much I hated this product. I have had my legs and other areas waxed before (still do my eyebrows) and I know the directions actually do say that it will be mildly painful/irritating and will take getting used to, but I couldn&#x27;t do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried letting the hair grow longish (like when waxing) so it may be easier to remove, just after showering, and just on the spur of the moment.  Seriously I did try to use this on multiple occasions and every time I just found it too painful to complete shaving even 1 leg.</li>
    <li> I use it on my  face, been using a Braun for years.  No more using tweezers.</li>
    <li> Great epilator for the price. Not that painful, and I find the light is actually quite helpful. My only complaint is I do still get ingrown hairs, but I&#x27;m told that&#x27;s to be expected of any epilator. Leaves me smooth for longer than a razor for sure though.</li>
    <li> I like it.easy to use and no irritation afterwords</li>
    <li> works but HURTS SO BAD in the process.Not that I did not expect the pain, its just much more than I planned on.</li>
    <li> I love it. It is amazing.</li>
    <li> Garbage. Do not buy it! I have used Braun Epilators in the past and by far this is the worse buy. My old Braun Epilator, who lasted 10 years broke then I had to start shaving again. I bought this Epilator recently, and not only it feels cheap, but also the quality of the job is does is very poor.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I had an older version of it that worked for YEARS, but once that one died and I got this, I wished I had bought it long before!&lt;br /&gt;This product glides over my legs and doesn&#x27;t hurt anywhere near to what I was used to with the other product or with waxing. My legs are smooth and the hair takes a long time to grow back. I would ave given it 5 stars, except I usually have to go over my legs, wait for a little while and do them again to get all the hairs. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it is really close!</li>
    <li> To be honest, this is the first time I have used an epilator. I found it difficult to use and a tad painful (and I am used to waxing). The hair did stay off longer than regular shaving or waxing, but not sure if it is worth the cost and pain. What I can say is that if you are in the market for an epilator, the Braun does do the trick and does it well. Just not something for me.</li>
    <li> Good product fast shipping! Thank you!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy and rough to the touch, but it does the job.  And, for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.  I also DON&#x27;T like rechargeable shavers because it&#x27;s such an inconvenience, but this one, I can just plug it in any time and use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want something basic without a lot of attachments, try it.</li>
    <li> I like this more than shaving, never used another epilator.  hurts like a bitch if you use it wrong, much less painful if you know what you&#x27;re doing.  still takes forever to get rid of all the hair though.  Best use is definitely for your armpits</li>
    <li> Great purchase! Painless! Light is very useful, I can use it even in the dark. Massaging rollers are useful for delicates areas. My first silk-epil is 15 years old and is still working... I really hope this is going to live as long as my previous one... I used Emoji but after 1 year it stop working...</li>
    <li> Great price really works I do not feel any discomfort using an epilator but have used one before</li>
    <li> Ordered this product going by good reviews around. It was for the first time that I was going to use anything of this sort...(before this I would undergo waxing). Well, I intended to use it for underarms and arms. I started with underarms first and It did hurt a little as I was using for the first time, but overall it was good.&lt;br /&gt;And I was about to recommend it to my friend when before it stopped working on it&#x27;s maiden run!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I was left in lurch... one arm done and another ...!&lt;br /&gt;Both the side tweezers won&#x27;t rotate at all. only the middle roller was working&lt;br /&gt;I had no option but to spend extra time and effort to continue with the middle working roller only to get my another arm done ..:(&lt;br /&gt;I have no option but to ask for a money return., which I will do today.&lt;br /&gt;But one thing good  about the product is that , I get  longer than usual hair , which the epilator was good to remove at.&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it full 5 had it not been for it&#x27;s failure!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. Now my legs are like nickel, no more waxing which means i can save money for something else. I feel very sexy .... You just need Alcohol to clean the little robot,</li>
    <li> the product has rriving on time and there is a good packaging. no surprise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no problems using it</li>
    <li> I guess I read the chart wrong because I was under the impression that this would work without being plugged in-- it doesn&#x27;t. Didn&#x27;t really find that to be much of a problem, though, since I didn&#x27;t see the need to take it anywhere there wasn&#x27;t an outlet.&lt;br /&gt;Hurt a little more than I thought it would the first time I used it, but I guess I got used to it quickly because the second time I tried it didn&#x27;t bother me nearly as much. I end up using it about once a week, which is a huge improvement over shaving every day... though I should mention I made my boyfriend try it on a tiny patch of hair on his leg (as revenge for calling me a baby when I said it hurt when I first tried it) and he&#x27;s still completely hair free after two weeks...&lt;br /&gt;It works great everywhere but my armpits-- for some reason I can&#x27;t seem to make it work in that particular area? Maybe I need to wait for the hair to get a bit longer before I try it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Also I saw this for $50 at Walmart and got super excited that I bought it here instead.)</li>
    <li> This is piece of junk and does not work the way it is supposed to work.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth spending the money.</li>
    <li> I have had a braun 5 series epilator that looks very similar to this one for at least 6 years.  I&#x27;m worried that it will crap out on me, so i wanted to find a replacement.  I tried Emjoi eRase e60 and the Emjoi Emagine with 72 tweezers, but neither were efficient.  Neither of the two grabbed the hair - I don&#x27;t think the dual-opposed heads work very well.  Anyway, after returning those two, I bought this one.  It is much slower and definitely louder than all the epilators I have tried, but it really works great to get almost all of the hair!  I can see that it actually pulls the root out!  I will never switch from braun again.  Their epilators are superior in my experience.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it at all. i feel pain when i use it . Also, it should be linked with electric wire when ues it.</li>
    <li> I will issue a disclaimer right away. I have never had much luck with the epilators. My skin must be too sensitive on my legs. I&#x27;m okay with eyebrow threading and tweezing on my eyebrows, and have even attempted tweezing of my hair on my legs (without much luck because I get bored easily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Silk epilator is no different from the other appliances I tried, in that I develop redness quickly and the pain becomes unbearable much too soon (I usually have a high threshold for pain).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that you get about a month worth of reprieve when you use the device.</li>
    <li> I have a Braun (SE7681 Silk-&amp;eacute;pil 7 Wet and Dry Epilator) but its battery not enough to finish my legs at one time, so I decided to use it just for my face and when I need to use the shaver and to buy this Braun (Series 3-3170 Silk Epil Epilator) for the rest of my body since it takes more time. I like it not only because it does what it suppose to but also because it doesn&#x27;t get hot after more than a half hour of using like one of my first Epilators. I big fan of Braun afterall :).</li>
    <li> I bought this for my legs and it works fine for that. I have had other epilators in the past so didn&#x27;t have to deal with the discomfort from first-time use. Might need a more expensive model for use on other areas: (face, underarms, etc.) but I have only used it on my legs. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I didnt like this epilaror i guess it&#x27;s not meant for ladies over 25 yeas old, you gotta have extremely tight skin. I couldn&#x27;t use it without getting my skin rolled and pinched in to it :( ouch!!!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. The light is a wonderful feature. Much better than the ancient one I had with a metal coil.</li>
    <li> This was my first use of an epilator.  I had heard the rumors, I knew it was going to hurt.  But honestly I think the worst of it was hearing that buzz it makes when turned on.  There&#x27;s just something scary about that sound.  And then the feeling of that first hair being ripped out.  I do believe I screamed.  But then it got better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All epilators are bound to hurt, at least at first.  After all, you&#x27;re ripping hair out of your skin, it&#x27;s not exactly a pain free action.  But with time it hurts less and less as your skin and mind gets used to it.  That being said, it wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be, and I used this thing everywhere.  Legs, bikini line, and armpits.  Surprisingly it was the armpits that hurt the most, they felt bruised for days and I will not ever epilate them again.  And I wouldn&#x27;t advise that particular area for epilation to anyone else either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two settings on this epilator, a gentler one that goes a bit slower, and an efficient one that moves faster.  Neither really did a spectacular job at ripping the hair out.  I had to go over the same area multiple times and still had to shave later on for some hairs the epilator just couldn&#x27;t get.  And it wasn&#x27;t like they weren&#x27;t easy hairs to pull, they were the length recommended in the user&#x27;s manual and not particularly fine, but the epilator just couldn&#x27;t get to them.  I would say that to do both legs and get as much hair out as possible probably took close to an hour using this machine.  The good news is that it takes longer to grow back than shaving does.  There is a warning that this product can cause ingrown hairs, painful red bumps etc.  I experienced the bumps but they went away overnight and have not had any problems with ingrown hairs, so I expect this reaction varies from person to person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like that this machine came with a little light.  It made seeing missed hairs easy and if you&#x27;re in a dark room, the whole process was made easier because of the light.  The cord on the device is long enough you can sit down in a chair in the bathroom (or elsewhere) and use the device, although I don&#x27;t think it would be long enough to let you sit on the floor if the outlet isn&#x27;t near the floor.  As with most corded objects, this shouldn&#x27;t be used in the bathtub or shower.  Cleaning the device isn&#x27;t too bad, but I did find it a little hard using the brush they provided.  Something stiffer would probably work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use this on my legs probably.  Anywhere else it just isn&#x27;t worth the pain or time.  And I&#x27;ll only use it if I have a lot of time to devote to hair removal, as it is an involved process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review by M. Reynard 2012sier because of the light.

    <li> So far this item has worked really well.  At first I thought I wanted an Epilator Wet/Dry and cordless.  This one has turned out to be the right one for me.  It is not rechargeable and I can&#x27;t get it wet, but it is easy to use anywhere there is a plug.  There is some minor pain when used for the first time, but, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad as waxing!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my new braun. I would purchase this product again. I have one of their first shavers, I hope the new one lasts as long.</li>
    <li> First thing I did is remove the clipsable pain reducer, because it actually causes more pain! Anyway I never needed one so it doesn&#x27;t matter. This product is very good, the light helps a lot!</li>
    <li> Amazing machine and will last forever</li>
    <li> very happy with it! the light is very strong and helpful. product arrived really quickly, im loving it! if you hate the hustle of wax- its a perfect solution..</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t want to use a razor, an epitalor might be for you. In my case, I expected that the epilator removed all the hair, but you have to place it several times in the same spot to take most of the hair out. I tried to use it on my armpits, but it didn&#x27;t remove must of the hair. This epilator is just for legs.</li>
    <li> It claims to have a guard to protect skin, sometime this doesn&#x27;t help, tends to pull skin in, drew blood!</li>
    <li> I bought this epilator because I&#x27;m not very good at shaving everyday to keep my legs smooth. Also, when I shave, I can still see small black dots under the skin because my skin is very pale and my leg hair is pretty dark. I also wanted to switch to something reusable so I don&#x27;t have to buy blades and throw them into the landfill when they&#x27;re dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did hurt the first time I epilated my legs, but I got used to the pain and each time the pain decreased until now I don&#x27;t really feel like it hurts. I kind of enjoy ripping my hairs out by the roots: Pop! pop! pop! Goodbye, hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem with this epilator is that it takes a very long time to clear my legs of hair. Since the head isn&#x27;t curved, only a narrow area of the head contacts my legs. I&#x27;m essentially slowly removing all my hair in 1/2\\&quot; strips. Pair that with the fact that I have to go over the same area 3-5 times to remove all of the hair, and epilating my legs once a week takes about 90 minutes. Add in my forearms and underarms, and it&#x27;s just too long for me to spend on hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem seems to be that the tweezers only close on a specific point on the rotating drum. If the angle of the epilator isn&#x27;t just right, the tweezers are closed when they pass over my hair. Or sometimes they just break my hair off at the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still like the concept of epilating and the way it keeps my legs looking smoother longer. I&#x27;m upgrading to a model with a larger number of dual-opposed discs to see if it is more efficient at removing unwanted hair.</li>
    <li> I was reading reviews about this product and I could not believe that some people gave bad review for the product because it hurts! Of course it hurts and they all hurt. But that does not mean that product is not good. It works very well and results are very good. I would recomend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent  product very efficient, easy to use and I will always recommend this product  to family and friends! Thanks You!!</li>
    <li> The Braun 3170 Silk Epil Epilator is a great device in concept and likely works for many people, if they can stand the pain.  While the epilator is typical Braun quality throughout and it actually does remove hair, it&#x27;s just not useable when it comes to pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the device is solid and well built.  The light is awesome and gives you plenty of visibility.  It&#x27;s a little bit loud, but that&#x27;s not a concern.  After a review of the instructions, the epilator is simple and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it does remove hair and does so effectively for the most part.  There were some misses and maybe if a model with more tweezers was used it would have a higher success rate.  Unfortunately, it was painful enough not to want to use it more than a couple of times.  Irritation was a problem as well.  The irritation may have gone away after additional uses, but the desire to continue using the epilator had faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If pain or irritation is a concern to you, I might recommend a higher model with additional features and tweezers (not only would that help be more efficient at hair removal but the task would likely happen quicker).</li>
    <li> I bought my wife a wet and dry shaver from Wallgreens and she said its not sharp enough. I bought her the Braum and I havent heard a word :)</li>
    <li> Let me preface this by saying that I read up on how to use this product a lot before trying it out. I exfoliated like mad before using it and took a hot shower (everything the blog posts said would help). Here I am now with stubbly irritated legs, and over 20 ingrown hairs on one lower leg alone. I am incredibly frustrated as I was really hoping that this would actually work for me since I hate shaving. Now I have to find a way to get rid of these ingrowns without scarring up my legs. To be fair I gave it a month&#x27;s worth of effort to try to make it work for me. I am incredibly disappointed with this product and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as it say&#x27;s. I am impressed! I have only had it a couple weeks now but hopefully I will continue to love it!</li>
    <li> To my friends out there; seriously, I didn&#x27;t order this for myself.  My hairy legs will remain that way for a while, at least until I take up bike racing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A short review of the Braun Se3170, paraphrased from the notes of my lovely wife.  First, \\&quot;if you&#x27;re going to get me a present, could it at least be a CD or a massage?  Why did you buy me this thing?  Are you saying I&#x27;m HAIRY?  Is that it?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This went on for a while.  I learned my lesson, pointed out that I mowed the lawn and washed her car, and then, after I rubbed the mark on my arm where she slapped me, I got the goods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Se3170 is comfortable to hold, and requires no batteries; it has a nice-length cord that detaches.  The controls are simple.  To her surprise, it&#x27;s not a shaver, but a little machine that pulls individual hairs out like little tweezers.  (Surprise, honey!)  \\&quot;It only really hurts when you use it,\\&quot; she told me, \\&quot;not afterward.  There&#x27;s no after-pain.\\&quot;  She put the setting on \\&quot;low\\&quot; as directed and her first sensation was \\&quot;ouch.\\&quot;  She says it&#x27;s more \\&quot;uncomfortable\\&quot; than \\&quot;painful\\&quot; but she could see how such a device would be handy for girls to whom shaving causes many more issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She did say that it took several repeated trips over the same area to get all the hairs, and that was frustrating.  As for underarm use, it falls under the category of \\&quot;grin and endure it.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says that all in all it is a good product and she will use it again.  My impression is that such a device, despite the best names in shaving and grooming, is one of the most diabolical torture devices I can think of, and I feel guilty for getting it for her!  I thought I was providing a good option to shaving, which I guess I did, but I would never want to use such a contraption on my face, so why would I want my wife to use it on her legs and arm pits?  My intentions were good, but now I feel like the bully who lives his life vicariously through a leg blender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For its good points, I&#x27;ll give it three stars, which is where my wife&#x27;s opinion hovers as well, but a review which contains \\&quot;ouch\\&quot;, \\&quot;painful\\&quot;, \\&quot;grin and endure it\\&quot;, and \\&quot;uncomfortable\\&quot;, well, how could I give it any more?  God Bless you ladies out there./&gt;For its good points, I&#x27;ll give it three stars, which is where my wife&#x27;s opinion hovers as well, but a review which contains \\&quot;ouch\\&quot;, \\&quot;painful\\&quot;, \\&quot;grin and endure it\\&quot;, and \\&quot;uncomfortable\\&quot;, well, how could I give it any more?

    <li> Like the Energizer Bunny - this just keeps going and going and going. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had now at least 10 years - from when it first came out. Of course I care for well, but as years go by I need to use less and less frequently.&lt;br /&gt;Great for underarms and legs (all I&#x27;ve tried).&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a tip as I remember from the Early Days when it hurt like H - - - : some use ice to numb first - that helps; but for super-tender places like underarms or bikini area - either doing waxing first for a few months till it is less tender, or using tweezers (even a dozen or so hairs a day) - the follicles DO become less tender / sensitive. Over time, you get to where it hardly feels at all. ZIP and you&#x27;re done. No razors, no mess, no stubble. Really. Yes, it is an investment of time - the ads for instant and no pain are greatly over-hyped. Unless a lot has changed since I bought mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about all the bells and whistles  - lights and pulsing and whatnot. I have basic model - the one pictured. It is MORE than adequate.</li>
    <li> I have had a Braun epilator (german made 220) for 16 years. It broke so of course i decided to go for Braun again. The principle is the same the sound is the same this one is upgraded with a light and massagers which i took off anyway. It does the job just as good as the first one i had. As i have used one since I was teenager i don&#x27;t think there is pain involved...it&#x27;s just pinching feels a bit sore at first but that&#x27;s what you get when you pull hair out. There is no way it will be completely painless. This model is simpler than the others i looked at but I think it&#x27;s perfectly good for the purpose it&#x27;s made for. The hair most definitely gets thinner and I have patches on my legs with no hair growing back up. I will always prefer an epilator to shaving. The results last you just have to be consistent if you start shaving again the hair will start growing just as thick as before..personal observation! Price wise it&#x27;s great too.</li>
    <li> I already had the same one in Europe and I knew what I am buying when I got here.... Makes thing easier during the summer, and very good for hand hair removal too. I like nice smooth hands when I&#x27;m wearing short sleeves...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been epilating for 20 years! This is the worst epilator of them all! Shame on you Braun. The motor is so loud I needed ear plugs. It wasn&#x27;t a gentle tug like past epilators I purchased in the 90s and in 2001. Sent it right back!</li>
    <li> The good news is that this little contraption does indeed pull your hairs out by the roots like it advertises. The bad news is, it doesn&#x27;t get them all on the first couple of passes, meaning that the process becomes an uncomfortable one as you attempt to go back to catch those stray hairs sticking up repeatedly. Also it&#x27;s not cordless, so you&#x27;ll have to use this baby near an outlet, which already limits its usefulness. I&#x27;d say go with a disposable razor instead of this as at least with that, you&#x27;re pretty much guaranteed to get the results you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a perfect size and I love the light. It works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom, who had a hard time finding one, and she loves it!</li>
    <li> I wont recommend this to no one&lt;br /&gt;I was very surprised in a bad way about this epilator i used the braun for long time ago but since i need it a new one i boughy this on amazon but the hair comes after 3 days and it doesnt leave your skin soft at all... Dont waist your money on this item</li>
    <li> I had to get a fairly cheap epilator as mine stopped working. I&#x27;ve been using these things for years now and Braun is still my favorite brand. This model doesn&#x27;t have several adapters as the one I had, but the light makes it up for any extra accessory it may lack. You are not going to miss a single hair, and for those more sensitive areas, you have a massager that makes it a bit better. If you are willing to spend a bit more, get one of the Braun that comer with the whole adapter set AND the light. Avoid the ones that are water resistant and made to use in the shower, you&#x27;ll end up using them just as the regular ones.</li>
    <li> Very effective on armpit, toe, knuckle, and other long coarse hair. Not too effective on legs, unless you grow out your hair very long before using this. However, this epilator does what it is supposed to do and works just as well as the more expensive models.</li>
    <li> So bad.  Literally every hair turned into an ingrown hair on a test patch.  I used as directed, and I received about 25 ingrown hairs and one got infected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product but sometimes it cuts the hair instead of taking it from the root, making the hair grow back in a matter of days. The light is very useful, especially at night.</li>
    <li> Several years ago I bought a Braun SE3170 Silk-épil 3 SoftPerfection Epilator (review at http://www.amazon.com/review/RBXL7OYRNUE07/ ) and I really liked it. Eventually it wore out, and when I went to get a new one I found that the model seems to have been discontinued or something -- even if I could find one for sale it was a lot more expensive than what I&#x27;d originally paid, so I decided to try this other Braun model as it was more on par with what I wanted to pay for an epilator; and since it was the same company, I figured it would be similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried, especially based on some reviews, that it might be harsher than the other model or that it might be bulkier and unfit to use on the face. When I got it, I found the old head attachments from my SoftPerfection still fit this one, so it just looked larger (I guess because the sides don&#x27;t taper) without actually being particularly bigger. The new design with the light on it is pointless but not really harmful I suppose -- in a way it helps make the hairs you miss more visible, but if you&#x27;re like me and just run it till it stops pulling anyway, it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference whether you saw what you missed the first pass or not. I found I could use it on my face and my legs both just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway... it gets the job done about the same as the old model, just a slightly different design one needs to get used to. Hopefully it&#x27;ll be good for several more years.</li>
    <li> I really loved this. It was much cheaper on Amazon than in the stores. Works as advertised. Worked on the arms as well as legs and if it&#x27;s too painful, I suggest you shave and then use it afterwards.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay nothing great ..... Thought it would work superior to my old Philips one but was disappointed  😔 :(</li>
    <li> Good price for good quality product</li>
    <li> Fantastic, the best purchase I miss</li>
    <li> You have to grit your teeth during the first couple of uses, but it&#x27;s well worth it. I haven&#x27;t shaved in WEEKS!!!</li>
    <li> I used to have the first model Braun ever made and I had it for about 10 or 11 years but it fell in the toilet :(  I couldn&#x27;t find the exact model but this one was close. However; this one is a little bit rough on the skin compared to the original model.&lt;br /&gt;This does the job and I have smooth skin for 2-3 weeks. I use it for my legs, arms; armpit and the facial hair and it&#x27;s been great so far.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t pull the very fine hair though.</li>
    <li> girlfriend is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> All I can say is OUCH! I had a similar product about 15 years ago and it was terribly painful but I thought for sure by now they would have improved it to be better and less painful. Nope, same awful pain. I couldn&#x27;t even finish one leg because it was so painful. I&#x27;ll stick to shaving with a razor, thank you!</li>
    <li> Years and years ago, I had an epilator, but it was so painful to use that I ended up returning to shaving.  I thought I would try out this model to see if the newer versions were less painful to use -- but quickly discovered that that&#x27;s not the case.  My pain threshold is pretty strong (at least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been told my waxers and doctors), but this thing is like a mini torture device! Eek!  The thing is that that it doesn&#x27;t even seem to work that well; I usually have to go over an area several times with this to get it to remove all hair.  If I&#x27;m going to have some pain, I&#x27;d rather have the results be more long-lasting, like my results with waxing are. It&#x27;s back to my regular ol&#x27; low-tech razor!</li>
    <li> great product i use it for my face particulary cheeks because if you shave hat hair it will become rough...and it picks every little hair...so for men its great lol</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this silk epil. Soft, with a very useful light to remove hiden hair. Good quality for a very reasonable price</li>
    <li> Totally love it. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I am glad i bought that product.it is not too loud or heavy.i wish there was also a storage bag for the epilator in the box.</li>
    <li> Friend recommended. Tried this a few days before we left for our Florida beach vacation &amp; I&#x27;ll never go back to shaving again!  Why, because it lasted FOREVER!  Awesome awesome awesome!  I liked this more than a wax because I could do it in the privacy of my own bathroom. Legs &amp; bikini.  It was louder than I expected, so it made me a teensy nervous at first, but you get used to it.  Then you can&#x27;t stop because the hair is gone!!  Whoohoo!&lt;br /&gt;TIP OF THE DAY:  Use a numbing cream, it helps &amp; is worth the stop to the pharmacy dept.</li>
    <li> It is AWESOME! I use it on EVERY hairy area of my body (besides my actual hair of course lol) and it works GREAT. Yes, sometimes I have to go over a section several times (like on the knees) but it&#x27;s totally fine. It has 2 speeds, which is pretty cool for certain more delicate areas.&lt;br /&gt;The head is REALLY easy to clean (you might need a plucker for that though.) AND the light is actually more useful than what I thought (helps you notice unexpected hair lol.) Thing leaves your legs SOOOOO smooth, I love it (so does my boyfriend hee hee.)&lt;br /&gt;I find the chord pretty long too. The only down part is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a case our pouch, so you gotta be creative about that.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the less expensive on the market... and you enjoy the Braun quality: solid, reliable and doing a good work. Of course, you will have to pass several times on the same spot because this model is from &amp;#34;the previous generation&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t have two heads, but considering the price and the brand, I would not exchange it for another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light is really useful!</li>
    <li> This one works but does lot of skin pulling and different design tweezers. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one for males when there&#x27;s bumps in the groin area it will pitch and pull part of skin, works good on women for smooth skin but again private area no no, similar to males. Others has better design for private parts use.</li>
    <li> First of all, let me say this is my first experience with an epilator. After reading the other reviews, I chose this one for its performance and price. I have not been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Does it hurt? Yes. Mostly just the first time. Except for around my ankles, that hurts every time. It does get better the more you use it due to the fact that you won&#x27;t have to do your entire leg every time. I find I only have to touch up certain places every 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;How can you make the experience better? Definitely exfoliate in the shower before hand. I also rub witch hazel on afterwards and when that dries I put Desert Essences tea tree oil ointment on the places I&#x27;ve epilated. That saves on the dreaded ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that could be better? I wish it bad more tweezers for pulling out the hair. Sometimes you do have to go over places a few times to get all the hair. So, give yourself plenty of time to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts. Worth the money for the job it does.</li>
    <li> love this epilator - it has changed my summer not having to shave or wax</li>
    <li> Great product. Everything as described</li>
    <li> Alright ladies (and gents, too), I wanted to share some tips for beginners when using this product.  First, a note about myself: I  have been embarrassed by body hair my whole life.  For a lady, I have very thick hair that grows very quickly and had pretty much given up on wearing skirts and dresses because I would have had to shave every day!  This epilator as changed all that.  So if you are thinking of getting it, here are some tips to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) WAX BEFORE THE FIRST USE:  If you have been shaving for a long time, I strongly recommend waxing before the first use of this product, unless you have nerves of steel or very fine or sparse hair.  Then, wait a few days and try the Braun Series 3 on the hairs that got left behind by waxing because they were too short.  Using this product on all of your hair at once, especially if the first time they&#x27;ve been pulled out of the root, would be very painful!  So diminish that by waxing first, then using this every few days to get rid of the hair as it comes back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) HOLD SKIN TIGHT: As with waxing, you want to make sure to hold your skin tight while using this product, especially around the curvier parts of your legs.  The device pulling on the skin causes pain you can easily avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) START WITH THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE: Trying this first on the area around your ankles or other sensitive parts will make you go OUCH! Start on the flat part of your calf a little higher up or wherever is less sensitive, then work your way up to the other parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) PAMPER YOURSELF: I highly recommend taking time to pamper yourself before and after epilating.  Take a warm shower or bath, exfoliate to prevent ingrown hairs and get flattened hairs to stick up, pat dry.  I like to use soothing baby powder with aloe, though this does gum up the rotating head a bit so that may not be the best idea.  If you&#x27;re anxious about using this the first time, light a candle and put on some nice music.  Finally, apply a nice-smelling cream or oil after you&#x27;re done to get those legs feeling extra smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) IT GETS EASIER: Those first hairs feel like something between a pinch and a poke.  But it does get easier! As the hairs grow back in and you get used to the feeling, after a while I can say that pain is very minimal, and much better than if you accidentally nick yourself shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General Opinion: I really like this product.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I got mine on sale but think that at full price, it would be expensive for the limited features you get.  It&#x27;s an OK price if you are looking to try an epilator for the first time like I was.  Now that I realize this is a good solution for me, I will probably invest in one of the Braun 7&#x27;s so I can use it in the shower.  Also, if you use baby powder or something, it can gum up the device so be careful and make sure you clean it after every use.  The massaging heads really help get rid of the ouchy feeling, like when you rub your hands over your legs to sooth them after waxing.  In general, I&#x27;d really recommend this product if you want to try out an epilator before committing to a more expensive model.ally, apply a nice-smelling cream or oil after you&#x27;re done to get those legs feeling extra smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) IT GETS EASIER: Those first hairs feel like something between a pinch and a poke.

    <li> I needed something to replace razors because they would leave me red and bumpy for days. I love this machine but I&#x27;m not going to lie, it still kinda hurts. Something I have to get used to.</li>
    <li> Very good wired epilator. The battery in the other versions is terrible, so that fixes it.&lt;br /&gt;Every few months, it will need a deep cleaning! Remove the screw on the back of the head and work your way in, removing stuck hair.</li>
    <li> It really wasn&#x27;t that bad using it the first time.  Just a little pinch.  And the hairs have not grown back as fast either. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> do its gob very poorly and its resaults includs ingrown hair and pimples.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an epilator that got lost while moving. The Braun Silk Epil takes a lot of work to get the job done. It is only somewhat effective and I find I have to go over areas multiples of times whereas my last Epilator took one slow swipe up to get the job done. Kinda disappointed. Will save money and buy the Emjoi when I can.</li>
    <li> It wasnt what i was expecting</li>
    <li> Really quick and effective! Of course it will be painful it is pulling out the hair</li>
    <li> Bought as gift for my wife and she loves it. She wants another one plus is planning to buy one for each of her sisters on their birthday. Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Little to no pain during use, great price for the product.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife for her birthday. She loves it and I bought it for a great price.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun epilator for 5 years prior to buying this one and was not hesitant to spend the money on the &amp;#34;top of the line&amp;#34; product. The first one stopped working three months after I purchased it and since it was still under warranty it was replaced in July 2013. The replacement stopped working a 14 months later, so that just makes it a junk product. It can&#x27;t be cleaned properly on the right side of the epilating head and the hairs get stuck under the rotating head and the base. Extremely  disappointed!</li>
    <li> it&#x27; s better then the Silk Epil older models, less painful from those models, but it make more noise and make it impossible using at night time.</li>
    <li> Super happy with my purchase. It works just the way people who do the long write-ups describe it as working. Like they say, take your time &amp; use on clean skin and on shorter hair. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> How this works is by small wheels spin which make little metal pincers grab. Almost like little lobster claws going &#x27;round and &#x27;round! ha ha!! As it passes over your skin, the tweezing action of the spinning grabbers get a hair, and (yes) yank it out. Like a motorized row of tweezers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work, but it is a little ouchy. I do use wax. So I know ouchy. But somehow the fast pull of wax over a large area is different. It hurts too, but you get a large area with one ouch. Here is like little hurts over and over and over. I also had areas (knees!!) where I had to go over the area multiple times to get the hairs. Still this has the benefit of a one-time cost, unlike wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about hair removal (from this or wax) is the results last longer that shaving or depilatory methods (like nair.) those methods just remove hair above the skin by cutting or burning it off. This (and wax) take the WHOLE hair, so you have smoother skin while the hair regenerates. Now, hair is sort of like plants, the grow-cycles are different, so an \\&quot;older\\&quot; hair follicle may already be preparing to send out a new one, and a new one, may be at the beginning of the growth cycle, so you get a longer time before a new one forms and re-emerges. Another nice thing about this method of removal, is that you don&#x27;t get the sharp, cut end of a hair coming forward (which feels scratchy), you get a new hair with a softer tapered end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this all the time...especially winter. I just shave. It is easier and faster for me. But for summer, I don&#x27;t like any stubble and lean towards this. I used to wax, but legs take FOREVER and use a lot of wax (and I am too cheap to go to a salon for leg hair! ha ha!!) This saves me money! (that I can spend on stuff like shoes! yay!! ha ha!!!)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this one.....it was too painful for me. Ended up buying something else</li>
    <li> It did pull out the hair but it left a lot of short broken ones.  Didn&#x27;t like it so returned</li>
