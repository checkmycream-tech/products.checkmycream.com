      <li>This gel is great!</li>
      <li>But the coloring/gel combo is wonderful!</li>
      <li>Great addition to the makeup bag and adds a great finish to a made up face!</li>
      <li>The product is great.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m once again happy.  </li>
      <li>GOOD PRODUCT, DOESN&#x27;T MAKE</li>
      <li>This is the best gel and worth the price paid.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>it really more of a brown, not brunette.</li>
      <li>Anastasia, I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love this product - although I now do buy the darker shade.  </li>
      <li>The color was way to light,</li>
      <li>The color is true to the label an it washes off easily at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>In my seventies, my hair is still mostly its original brown color, but my eyebrows are very sparse and colorless.</li>
      <li>I have super course/spike-y eyebrows and this gel</li>
      <li>They were right.  </li>
      <li>Stays on well all day and is never irritating.</li>
      <li>Really covers the gray hairs in your brows</li>
      <li>The product covers my gray brows very well.</li>
      <li>And I find the &amp;#34;brunette&amp;#34; color doesn&#x27;t darken the brow as much as I like.  </li>
      <li>The color is a perfect light brown in comparison to other eyebrow gels that are too dark and heavy.</li>
      <li>This goes on with a quick stroke or two of the wand, I like to use a soft, old toothbrush to gently brush the brow into place after application.  </li>
      <li>love it once I got the technique down on how to apply it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I use this daily and love that it shapes my eyebrows and fills in with a little bit of color.</li>
      <li>Stays on all day, no smudging, looks natural.  </li>
      <li>Brows drawn in with eyebrow pencil are always too dark, and the harsh outlines are a dead give away, unless you have a very artistic hand for lightly drawing in feathery strokes, which I don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Plus there is barely any product inside.</li>
      <li>I have a dark black hair, and this color just a little bit lighter than my hair, and it works so good.</li>
      <li>Blonde does not mean pink or orange.</li>

    <li> This is the best gel and worth the price paid. It is not like others that seem to be mascara labeled as brow gel. Doesn&#x27;t clump and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. Stays on well all day and is never irritating. The color is a perfect light brown in comparison to other eyebrow gels that are too dark and heavy. The product covers my gray brows very well.</li>
    <li> The color was way to light, it really more of a brown, not brunette.</li>
    <li> This gel is applied ne in the morning and lasts all day long! The color is true to the label an it washes off easily at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> This literally didn&#x27;t do anything for my brows. Plus there is barely any product inside. Def not for me, especially for the steep price.</li>
    <li> I have a dark black hair, and this color just a little bit lighter than my hair, and it works so good.</li>
    <li> In my seventies, my hair is still mostly its original brown color, but my eyebrows are very sparse and colorless.

    <li> Where has this product been all my life....loving it!</li>
    <li> The brunette color is awful.  Not brunette at all!  I don&#x27;t like this product.</li>
    <li> This gel is great! It doesn&#x27;t run even when I&#x27;m working out or running.</li>
    <li> Love this product - although I now do buy the darker shade.  I&#x27;m a blonde, but dark blonde.  And I find the &amp;#34;brunette&amp;#34; color doesn&#x27;t darken the brow as much as I like.  The product is great.  Controls, neatens, darkens my eyebrows.</li>
    <li> This came horribly runny and separated. Returing</li>
    <li> love it once I got the technique down on how to apply it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I use this daily and love that it shapes my eyebrows and fills in with a little bit of color. Great addition to the makeup bag and adds a great finish to a made up face!</li>
    <li> I was heartbroken when I was told it was being discontinued.  Then I was told ingredients being modified.  Well,. hallelujah, Amazon had the product for me and I&#x27;m once again happy.  Anastasia, I love this product.  Please, please, don&#x27;t discontinue.  It&#x27;s the only thing that covers those pesty white hairs.,</li>
    <li> Every tint I have tried for blonde hair colors the hair pinkish-orange. Blonde does not mean pink or orange. I had to throw it away it looked so silly.</li>
    <li> Really covers the gray hairs in your brows</li>
    <li> Mrs Hoth here; read about this product in &amp;#34;Real Simple&amp;#34; magazine a year or so ago.  They gave it rave reviews.  They were right.  I&#x27;m at the age where my eyebrows are getting lighter with some white in them while my hair is still darker.  This goes on with a quick stroke or two of the wand, I like to use a soft, old toothbrush to gently brush the brow into place after application.  Stays on all day, no smudging, looks natural.  I have very sensitive skin and there is no irritation.  Highly recommend.</li>
