<li> There are rubber feet on the corners so the mirrors are slightly raised</li>
<li> and if you place something heavy on it, it breaks.</li>
<li> This item was very poorly made and very fragile.  </li>

    <li> I have a set myself and bought this for a friend.  It&#x27;s a beautiful addition to your table centerpiece.</li>
    <li> Unwrapped the 3 piece mirror set, put it on my table and it is a &amp;#34;winner!&amp;#34;  Would absolutely recommend it; very nice addition to the scope of my Thanksgiving table.</li>
    <li> Mostly as expected, mine arrived with a tiny chip in the corner of one of the pieces. Could have happened in transit.</li>
    <li> The beveling is wonderful and will hopefully be durable for years to come.  We love it!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Perfect size and shape. Quality product that did not disappoint.</li>
    <li> I used this for Christmas deco. in my guest bathroom. Used all white and silver tiny lights with small white christmas flowers. lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> perfect for what I was wanting these for</li>
    <li> I am so very pleased with this set! I do plan to order more later n the year for each one of my daughters. Thank u for such a beautiful item.</li>
    <li> Pretty mirror set; one of the plastic foots underneath is missing on one of the end pieces. Not worth shipping back, really</li>
    <li> This is the second set of these I have purchased. I really liked the look and the price was right so I was hoping that the excessive chipping that happened to my first set was a fluke; not the case at all unfortunately. The same chipping happened to the second set as well. These are stored in a room that sees almost no traffic at all. These are attractive yet very delicate. If you are planning on placing these in a high traffic area you might want to go with a sturdier brand.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful. This is my second set and it is a great buy</li>
    <li> Arrived with a tiny chip on the edge one of the end sections, but not bad enough to deal with shipping it back. Looks beautiful as a base for my dining table centerpiece and the octagonal shape is good feng shui! The photo is my Christmas centerpiece for the dining room table. We had 2 leaves (10 seats) in the table and the mirror set was perfectly proportional--as it is when it has no leaves (6 seats).</li>
    <li> I was looking for a beveled mirror set to use as a runner on my dining room table for a home wedding. This set was perfect! It was priced attractively and  arrived quickly. The mirrors reflected very well the beautiful flowers.</li>
    <li> very well crafted. nice bevelled edges.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe I got this for the price I paid.  Love it!  Looks so festive on our dining room table.  Spaced the three pieces out and it looks even better than in the picture.</li>
    <li> Beautiful decor. Arrived in perfect condition. I placed it on a coffee table under some reflective glassware. It is elegant and stunning and a great price.</li>
    <li> Very nice, love it but do not place anything heavy like lead crystal on this.There are rubber feet on the corners so the mirrors are slightly raised and if you place something heavy on it, it breaks.</li>
    <li> This item was very poorly made and very fragile.  I barely got it on my foyer table and it chip on the corner.  I purchased this as a replacement for one that I had for over 20 years (I had dropped it during cleaning).  I sent email to vendor recently but never heard back. This is just another reason for me not to make purchases on line, if I had gone to a retail store I am sure they would have&lt;br /&gt;made good on my purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought for dining table for holiday decor. Have not used but unpacked to look over. Packed very well. Arrived intact.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly.  Is very nice.</li>
    <li> Nice set of mirrors that I have already set up on my table.</li>
    <li> Beautiful mirror set.  Use it for Christmas or center piece on dining table.  I put small white lights around it and used lots of candles and crystal.  Beautiful display.</li>
