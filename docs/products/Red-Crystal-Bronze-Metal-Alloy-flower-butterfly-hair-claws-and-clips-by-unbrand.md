    <li> Great Buy, Outstanding product, Excellent packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased every hair claw clip this seller has for purchase. I love them all!!! The quality of the clips are superb. I get so many compliments when I wear any of them. The stones are placed tightly and not cheaply. These clips are made to last, if you care for them nicely you can pass them down. I&#x27;ve shopped in many states and countries, and this seller has the best of the best!!! If you have long, then you&#x27;re looking in the right place. If your hair is short, then you may want to stick to the smaller of his showcase. Either way you go, you will not be disappointed. Again, I have purchased them all and they&#x27;re all beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is excellent!!</li>
    <li> Love this. So pretty. Solid too.</li>
    <li> I bought this claw clip to dress up my hair when I need to go out shopping. My hair does get unruly, and clipping it up with those plastic clips can look, dreary. This one is very pretty with its colored stone, can dress up your hair quickly.  It is a heavy clip for a three inch clip, due to the amount of stones in it, so keep that in mind if your hair is thin, it could work its way out. It looks prettier in person than in the picture. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a bit of dress up for every day.</li>
    <li> I love exotic hair clips - can&#x27;t stop looking at the hair that&#x27;s pulled into it when I see it.  This fabulous red jeweled clip does it all.</li>
    <li> beautiful hair clip, love the red</li>
    <li> These are Beautiful hair clips, they are made strong and hold well, I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...Such Beautiful colors. Every where I go strangers stop and ask me, where did you get that hair clip.</li>
    <li> was smaller than I though it would be. It is very pretty non the less.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome clasp, I bought several and they are all just beautiful and worth every penny, oh and they are made very well, so I expect they will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This clip was a gift which was greatly enjoyed by the recipient.&lt;br /&gt;The crystals placed in metal were pretty and the metal clips remain&lt;br /&gt;stationary in the hair.</li>
    <li> Lovely hair claw, have gotten many complements on this clip. Would recommend to anyone to buy.  Great for the price too.</li>
    <li> I really liked this clip, would&#x27;ve loved to have it in a larger size.  I did, however, have to glue a few crystals back on that had fallen off in the package.</li>
    <li> Too small and too heavy</li>
    <li> Pretty but too heavy to be worn comfortably.  I like the design but the clip pulls down too much on the hair and hurts</li>
    <li> A little heavy for my hair, but very pretty and festive.</li>
    <li> This beautiful hairpiece exceeded my expectations.  It is very classy looking and would appear to others to be expensive.  Don&#x27;t hesitate ordering from this company.</li>
    <li> I prefer metal clips to plastic, they seem to stay in my hair better and the metal clips seem more secure.  All the jeweled hair clips i&#x27;ve purchased via Amazon are wonderful and affordable.  It&#x27;s jewelry for your hair!</li>
    <li> Very disappointing.  I&#x27;ve used it maybe 6 or 7 times, and it broke.  What a waste of money, I&#x27;ll watch out for this seller in the future :(.</li>
    <li> How much can you say about a hair clip.  This clip is beautiful and I love it.  Would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> I have a few of these. I call them my &amp;#34;Glitzy clips&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;They are really pretty but they are heavy so they are more ornamental than functional.&lt;br /&gt;I use mine to clip my hair towel while my hair dries for a few moments.&lt;br /&gt;The glitzy part is totally camp for me, but I can see how it is beautiful and could be used to that effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember to support it somehow int the framework of the do.</li>
    <li> I really liked this although it was smaller than i imagined but I loved the colors</li>
