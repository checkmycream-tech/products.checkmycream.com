      <li>If you use it with your Calrisonic it will really buff your skin up nicely!</li>
      <li>I LOVE how this scrub smells and how smooth it makes my skin feel.  </li>
      <li>Works good but is gentle.</li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>This is a very gentle scrub that smells nice.</li>
      <li>Smooth and clean skin!  </li>
      <li>This product in particular is the best scrub I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
      <li>I thought they were pretty fine texture, enough that I was impressed.  </li>
      <li>But, it smells great and you can feel the exfoliating scrub part (unlike some products that just feel like regular gel).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle yet effective.  </li>
      <li>This and the Clear Skin Serum are my favorite MyChelle products, and these have kept my 30-some combination skin clear and beautiful.</li>
      <li>so people know to test it out first to make sure they don&#x27;t have an allergic reaction to it too.</li>
      <li>unless something better comes along ;)</li>
      <li>Afterwards, my skin is softer, smoother and well-balanced, and clean but not stripped.</li>
      <li>I found MyChelle line about a year ago and use it every morning to clean my face.  </li>
      <li>I tried to use it once or twice a week for special occasion</li>
      <li>I really loved this facial scrub.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this company.</li>
      <li>A similar product that does a good job is there pumpkin cleanser although it doesn&#x27;t offer the beads.</li>
      <li>What used to be a bumpy, congested, tired-looking complexion is now glow-y, smooth, and fresh.</li>
      <li>The smell is very soft and so far is doing a great job for my skin.</li>
      <li>The enzyme exfoliant is pretty strong.</li>
      <li>There are not that many skin care products that I would buy over and over again, but this one I do not want to live without!</li>
      <li>I love how it leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>The scrub seems to work best for me with daily use, especially if I leave it on for a minute or two.</li>
      <li>SUPER company and product.</li>
      <li>I have had great success with other products in this line like the fruit enzyme peel and the cranberry mud mask.</li>
      <li>This scrub in particular is gentle yet effective.</li>
      <li>Seriously, I have tried SOOO many products and Mychelle line is by far the best for me...</li>
      <li>This little beauty was a great product.  </li>
      <li>The first thing I love about this scrub is highly subjective - the scent.</li>
      <li>Only good things to say about the whole line of Mychelle products.</li>
      <li>I like the scrub because it leaves your face feeling fresh and revived without the use of harmful/toxic ingredients like parabens.      </li>
      <li>The texture of the granules are just right.</li>
      <li>I am out of this product right now</li>
      <li>I really love MyChelle products in general.</li>
      <li>It has a refreshing fragrance and is reasonable and natural.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product based on other peoples review and very pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>My skin feels very soft and smooth after and I really enjoy the natural citrus scent.</li>
      <li>It left my face feeling smooth and clean afterwards.</li>
      <li>It has a grainy yet gentle, creamy texture, and smells fresh and citrus-y.</li>
      <li>... when I first starting using this scrub I was in love with it.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin soft, smooth, and not overdry.</li>
      <li>I have been using this scrub for about 9 months now and my face is so soft and smooth</li>
      <li>To use up the rest of the product, I am using it on the back of my arms and on my chest and throat and that seems to be okay.</li>
      <li>My skin instantly feels smoother and more refined.</li>
      <li>The only thing that could make this product better is if the scrub had a finer texture.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not harsh like other scrubs I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s refreshing and my skin looks and feels so much better after using this.</li>
      <li>This same brand also makes a Fruit Fiesta Peel that I use once a week and the two products keep my skin looking smooth and fresh.</li>
      <li>Even though you can buy this line in any Whole Foods Store or similar type stores buying it on Amazon can get you better prices.  </li>
      <li>Even though it is made for your face, it also works great on your knees or elbows or any where you may have rough, dry skin.</li>
      <li>but I really do wish I could get some soon.  </li>
      <li>It keeps the dead layers off your face and keeps a nice glow.</li>
      <li>It compares to some of the \\&quot;microdermabrasion-style\\&quot; ones in that the grains are very small and there are a good amount of them.</li>
      <li>My skin feels very clean after using it but not irritated like some other scrubs.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this scrub to bring my total over 50.00 and get the 10.00 promo discount.  Wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like it, and am not really sure how \\&quot;natural\\&quot; this product is.  I wish Mychelle would join Skin Deep, so we could find out.    Anyhow, I like the scrub.  It smells good, and though someone mentioned he wish the grains were finer....I thought they were pretty fine texture, enough that I was impressed.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I had tried the Burt&#x27;s Bees exfoliator before this one, which had big pebbles in it.    So far, though....have to admit, I like the product.</li>
    <li> Something in this product irritates my eyes, even when I am very careful to keep it away from my eyes when washing my face.  To use up the rest of the product, I am using it on the back of my arms and on my chest and throat and that seems to be okay.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on other peoples review and very pleased with the product. It is so gentle (although it is a scrub) and will not use any other products or product line except Mychelle (I know, such a snob right?!). Seriously, I have tried SOOO many products and Mychelle line is by far the best for me...in a few weeks, my skin is clearer, smoother and less red and irritated. You just have to try it!    Thank you to other amazon reviewers for their input and experience in this product because I do not think I would have tried it otherwise.</li>
    <li> ... when I first starting using this scrub I was in love with it. In fact I probably would have given it five stars. It does a good job of polishing the face without being too abrasive. It has a creamy constancy to which is nice. However, after using it for a few months, I am getting a tad annoyed by the scent. It is not that is unpleasant, it&#x27;s just that it does not smell natural to me. Maybe I am overly sensitive, but it is starting to bother me. The other thing that makes this a four star and not a five it the beads. They are really hard to get entirely rinsed off. I feel like I rinse and rinse and rinse and they are still there! Oh, well, the results are good, so I will stick with it for now... unless something better comes along ;)</li>
    <li> The texture of the granules are just right. My skin feels very soft and smooth after and I really enjoy the natural citrus scent. Left on for a minute or so the exfoliation is excellent. I will be making this my new go to product!</li>
    <li> This stuff definitely does the trick. Slap it on, leave it for a minute and message it off with water. My skin instantly feels smoother and more refined. I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than once or twice a week though. The enzyme exfoliant is pretty strong. I have sensitive skin though, and it doesn&#x27;t make me red after use.</li>
    <li> I really love MyChelle products in general. I appreciate the thoughtfulness that goes into the sourcing and efficacy of the ingredients. I find some other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; brands add a bunch of oils that make my skin break out but not MyChelle. This scrub in particular is gentle yet effective. My skin feels very clean after using it but not irritated like some other scrubs.</li>
    <li> I really loved this facial scrub. It compares to some of the \\&quot;microdermabrasion-style\\&quot; ones in that the grains are very small and there are a good amount of them. I don&#x27;t like facial scrubs that have large or too few grains becuase it feels like they don&#x27;t work. This scrub exfoliates in two ways: it has a fruit acid in it that works just by sitting on your skin for a couple of minutes, and it has the graininess that you rub in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smells is wonderful, fresh and light. I would definitely buy this again; my only complaint is that the tube is very small and it&#x27;s quite pricey.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this scrub, especially with all the positive reviews (and not just on amazon), but unfortunately I had an allergic reaction to it (and weirdly only on the entire left side of my face). I&#x27;m not sure which ingredient caused it, but just wanted to write this review so people know to test it out first to make sure they don&#x27;t have an allergic reaction to it too. I did give it to my mom to try it so I&#x27;ll try to remember to update this with her thoughts on it.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using this long, so I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars and no higher. But, it smells great and you can feel the exfoliating scrub part (unlike some products that just feel like regular gel). It left my face feeling smooth and clean afterwards. Like it so far!</li>
    <li> This is a nice, light scrub that uses enzymes to break down dead skin cells. It has a refreshing fragrance and is reasonable and natural. SUPER company and product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with my skin for 20 years. This is the best scrub I&#x27;ve tried to date. It leaves my skin soft, smooth, and not overdry. I use it in the shower as Mychelle recommends, and it&#x27;s great. It clears off all the dead skin, clears pores, leave my rough patches smooth, but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight and damaged like apricot scrubs or microdermabrasion products.</li>
    <li> LEMONGRASS....that is what this smells like.  Mmmmm...I am out of this product right now but I really do wish I could get some soon.  This little beauty was a great product.  MyChelle is great period, but this scrub was delightful.  The beads aren&#x27;t harsh, you can leave it on your face for a little while and really take in the lemon scent for a while, rinse off, and then voila!  Smooth and clean skin!  I tried to use it once or twice a week for special occasion but if I had the money I would do this every morning as a little pampering ritual.</li>
    <li> Love love love that scrub. It leaves my skin feel soft and looking flawless.</li>
    <li> This is a very good scrub in the shower because it&#x27;s 100% natural, but I think the bar has been set extremely high with the incredible pumpkin peel and the fruit fiesta peel with Mychelle.    The only thing that could make this product better is if the scrub had a finer texture.</li>
    <li> I love scrubs and this is definitely one of the best.  The Fruit Enzyme scrub lathers up when mixed with a splash of water and has tiny scrubbing beads to help remove dead skin without leaving your face feeling scratched and tight.  Even though it is made for your face, it also works great on your knees or elbows or any where you may have rough, dry skin. Since it works in conjunction with other MyChelle products, I seem to only need to use it a maximum of once a week.</li>
    <li> Only good things to say about the whole line of Mychelle products.This is a great scrub.</li>
    <li> I use this scrub once a week. I do not have to press hard while using it. For me, I would not use it more than once a week, as too much scrubbing is not good for my skin.</li>
    <li> Terrific, gentle exfoliating scrub.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, locally made. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this company. No &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; ingredients. Makes my skin glow. Everyone comments on how nice my skin looks since I&#x27;ve used MyChelle. I would love to advertise for them if they are looking! Love, love, love their products!</li>
    <li> this product is way overpriced. It does smell good though. A similar product that does a good job is there pumpkin cleanser although it doesn&#x27;t offer the beads.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product with the White Cranberry cleanser and it really works great.  I love how it leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Really love this line of skincare.  It&#x27;s gentle yet effective.  This product in particular is the best scrub I&#x27;ve found so far.  Many have a greasy/gritty texture that&#x27;s difficult to rinse off.  This one does not.</li>
    <li> Only use Mychelle products.  Good for you and work well.  You can feel this scrub doing the work.  I use it every other day.</li>
    <li> Works very well and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Great face scrub, I use this all of the time.  it has really helped improve my complexion and is great for people with sensitive/acne prone skin as it is not too abrasive.</li>
    <li> using it for years; brightens you up</li>
    <li> I have been using this every day for years! It keeps the dead layers off your face and keeps a nice glow. If you use it with your Calrisonic it will really buff your skin up nicely! This same brand also makes a Fruit Fiesta Peel that I use once a week and the two products keep my skin looking smooth and fresh.</li>
    <li> This scrub works okay. I don&#x27;t see anything amazing about it, except for the fact that it&#x27;s minus the harsh chemicals. I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s gone, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be reordering.</li>
    <li> Let me just say that this scrub is amazing!  I have been using this scrub for about 9 months now and my face is so soft and smooth I still can&#x27;t believe it!  And its not that &#x27;fake&#x27; smooth feeling because of residue left behind like some other scrubs I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I actually wash my face before and after I use the scrub (just because I don&#x27;t like residue) and I still feel the difference in my face!  I have had great success with other products in this line like the fruit enzyme peel and the cranberry mud mask. MyChelle is pricy, but it WORKS and is not full of chemicals and silicones like the other products. I&#x27;m a fan for life! - gina</li>
    <li> I have been \\&quot;blessed\\&quot; with the typical combination skin, oily in places, taut in others, and with some occasional breakouts and fine lines to boot. A friend turned me on to this product after giving me some samples. I use this over my entire face after washing with regular cleanser. It has a grainy yet gentle, creamy texture, and smells fresh and citrus-y. After massaging a dime-sized amount in circles for a couple of minutes, I can feel that warmth that tells me the enzymes and fruit acids are doing their thing. The result? I seriously have gone without any foundation lately (just some tinted moisturizer), my skin looks that good. I find the more I use it, the better it works. After building up some tolerance to the fruit acids, I can now use it every other day. What used to be a bumpy, congested, tired-looking complexion is now glow-y, smooth, and fresh. I would estimate it took about 5 years off (and counting) my appearance. If this came in giant tubs I would buy them all!</li>
    <li> Loves the way it peels dead skin off.</li>
    <li> This is a very gentle scrub that smells nice. Easy to use and I get great results.</li>
    <li> LOVE this. I use it nightly. Fixed my skin. I&#x27;ll never use anything else again.</li>
    <li> I have combo/oily skin that is very sensitive with occasionally breakouts. I got this as a sample and LOVE it. It&#x27;s not harsh like other scrubs I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s refreshing and my skin looks and feels so much better after using this. I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times now and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or sensitivity. I will be buying the full size product from Amazon later today!</li>
    <li> Love it and will buy it again becasue it is organic and effective specially for my oily skin type face.</li>
    <li> Although my skin is sensitive when it comes to other MyChelle skincare products, it seems to tolerate the Fruit Enzyme Scrub.  I like the scrub because it leaves your face feeling fresh and revived without the use of harmful/toxic ingredients like parabens.      I also like the not-too-strong lemony scent!</li>
    <li> I Sonica Sharma today is 4/30/13 and I giving my feed back about scrub I think woooooow is enough for this please please please try one time amazing product I am gonna continue this my chella  step by step amazing product and wonderful thing no no no no chemical allll natural woohoo gud go amazon</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin that keeps me from using a lot of fancy products but this one works well for me and does not irritate my skin, but leaves it smoother, polished.  I use it about once a week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this fruit scrub every other day for ten years now. I&#x27;m a huge fan of the whole Mychelle line and this is the best exfoliating scrub that I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> The first thing I love about this scrub is highly subjective - the scent. It smells like a natural citrus grove, except not as &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34;. The second thing I love is how it makes my skin feel - and I use this on my face only. The exfoliating &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; are one thing - and are minor in my mind. The fruit enzymes that work to DISSOLVE dead skin cells (and you leave this on for one minute in the shower) are the real success here. My 65-year-old face seriously feels as smooth as that baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite skin care products.  It feels great, smells good and is a pleasure to use.  A little bit goes a long way....my last bottle lasted for such a long time!  There are not that many skin care products that I would buy over and over again, but this one I do not want to live without!</li>
    <li> I found MyChelle line about a year ago and use it every morning to clean my face.  The night time moisturizer is good to.  Even though you can buy this line in any Whole Foods Store or similar type stores buying it on Amazon can get you better prices.  I always check on-line pricing though just to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scrub has very small scrub enzymes, feels like sand, which I like better than the chunkier scrubs. I hope that makes sense.  The night time moisturizer is lite and nice too.</li>
    <li> I like Mychelle products - not all of them though and they are pricey. This scrub works well after using the Honeydew Cleanser. The smell is very soft and so far is doing a great job for my skin.</li>
    <li> I LOVE how this scrub smells and how smooth it makes my skin feel.  I would recommend this to anyone with combination skin.</li>
    <li> Great scrub. Works good but is gentle. Just use a tiny amount and then the tube lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the MyChelle line and this scrub is excellent.</li>
    <li> This and the Clear Skin Serum are my favorite MyChelle products, and these have kept my 30-some combination skin clear and beautiful. The scrub smells fruity and pleasant. The scrub has tiny beads, so it is gentle - unlike many other facial scrubs - and has never bothered my sensitive skin (which has become red &amp; irritated from other product lines). The scrub seems to work best for me with daily use, especially if I leave it on for a minute or two. Afterwards, my skin is softer, smoother and well-balanced, and clean but not stripped. I usually follow with the Fruit Enzyme Mist if I have time, and then the Serum. Highly recommended natural product!!</li>
