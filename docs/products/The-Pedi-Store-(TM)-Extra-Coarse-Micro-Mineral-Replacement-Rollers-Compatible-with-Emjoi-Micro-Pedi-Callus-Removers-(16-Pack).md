      <li>I love mine!</li>
      <li>If you buy them somewhere else you are probably going to pay a lot more!  </li>
      <li>These work wonderfully well, are easy to snap in and out and really do what they are supposed to.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve now placed an order for 16 more rollers.  </li>
      <li>My pedicurist told me about this and said I would love it.  </li>
      <li>I love love love it.  </li>
      <li>LOVE THE EMJOI UNIT AND ALWAYS NEED REFILLS</li>
      <li>It functions OK</li>
      <li>I love this system for smoothing my feet.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got this product.</li>
      <li>These are a great price however, some of the cylinders don&#x27;t quite fit right</li>
      <li>Love my appliance and these are probably better for me as I always want quick results. .  </li>
      <li>the surface shows wear much more quickly than the Emjoi brand</li>
      <li>Now I can continue to enjoy the use of my Emjoi for months to come.</li>
      <li>Using the Blue Micro Mineral Rollers work great and only takes a fews minutes to keep my feet looking great.</li>
      <li>I purchased these hoping they could replace the Emjoi Micro Pedi brand rollers and, although they fit it well, they are not a close match in quality.</li>
      <li>and they don&#x27;t wipe clean as easily.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have no complaints purchasing at such a good price.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I even use it on my extra dry fingers - works great!</li>
      <li>I use these after I use the more coarse one to smooth out.</li>
      <li>I looked for replacement rollers right away</li>
      <li>Fit the Micro Pedi and work great; however, I would have liked them to have a little more &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; to last a little longer.</li>
      <li>was to get the better price per unit in the long run.</li>
      <li>They will store easy enough for years to come</li>
      <li>Worked as needed and they will last a good long time from what I can tell.  </li>
      <li>Pretty much the same grain as the original from QVC.  </li>
      <li>that is why I bought so much</li>
      <li>I use my Emjoi Micro Pedi every other day to keep my keep feet in tip top shape.</li>
      <li>they are strong and they can do a little to much damage and hurt you if you don&#x27;t realize what your doing!</li>
      <li>Many of the refill rollers had a slight &amp;#34;lip&amp;#34; at the seam...almost as if the paper wasn&#x27;t pushed in all the way; however, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be something that can be fixed.</li>
      <li>They even order different types coarse, fine ect.  </li>
      <li>so I would always have soft feet!  </li>
      <li>don&#x27;t pay more for the green ones!</li>
      <li>The mineral surface is slightly more fine (less coarse) and the quality of workmanship is less than acceptable in some instances, which leaves me wondering if there is a quality control department or not.</li>
      <li>They fit into my emjoy no problem because I was a little concerned about that.</li>
      <li>This is not what seems to be extra coarse as the darker blue that came with the micro pedi roller originally.</li>
      <li>I live in sandals and bare feet all year.  </li>

    <li> These are a great price however, some of the cylinders don&#x27;t quite fit right and it makes noise as it spins. It functions OK but the noise is annoying. For the price, I&#x27;d probably buy them again.</li>
    <li> I use my Emjoi Micro Pedi every other day to keep my keep feet in tip top shape. Using the Blue Micro Mineral Rollers work great and only takes a fews minutes to keep my feet looking great.</li>

    <li> What can I say? These are great!!!!! Best price I could find for the pediatric machine I got on BBC, and these beat t her price as well.</li>
    <li> arrived in a timely manner.  great item.</li>

    <li> not the same that came with my Emjoi will not order agian</li>
    <li> Great deal for the price! Now I can continue to enjoy the use of my Emjoi for months to come.</li>
    <li> Great buy, love the product!</li>
    <li> This works great with my calus on my heels and my dad&#x27;s as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased these hoping they could replace the Emjoi Micro Pedi brand rollers and, although they fit it well, they are not a close match in quality. The mineral surface is slightly more fine (less coarse) and the quality of workmanship is less than acceptable in some instances, which leaves me wondering if there is a quality control department or not. Many of the refill rollers had a slight &amp;#34;lip&amp;#34; at the seam...almost as if the paper wasn&#x27;t pushed in all the way; however, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be something that can be fixed. I tried pushing it in further but it just flattened it. Also, they don&#x27;t last as long...the surface shows wear much more quickly than the Emjoi brand and they don&#x27;t wipe clean as easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got these for a bargain (about $35 for 16 rollers) and, considering that, they were acceptable; however, I don&#x27;t think I will be a repeat customer. Especially since they increased the price.</li>
    <li> I live in sandals and bare feet all year.  My heals always crack.  I have brought the file and it helps some.  I ordered the Emjoi micro-pedi to see if it migh work.  I love love love it.  I&#x27;ve now placed an order for 16 more rollers.  They even order different types coarse, fine ect.  If you suffer from cracked heals please order this product you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> These worked great.  Will buy them again when I run out.</li>
    <li> love it!!! great product</li>
    <li> Good value. Amazon is the best deal i have found for this product.  I have no complaints purchasing at such a good price.</li>
    <li> Great value, works well with the Micro Pedi.</li>
    <li> Worked as needed and they will last a good long time from what I can tell.  I tried cleaning them off and that will extend the life as well.  Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> They fit into my emjoy no problem because I was a little concerned about that. They are a great price for the bundle you are getting that is why I bought so much was to get the better price per unit in the long run. They will store easy enough for years to come I&#x27;m sure! Just go slow when using them at first they are strong and they can do a little to much damage and hurt you if you don&#x27;t realize what your doing! I would recommend them to someone! and I would buy them again. I had actually bought the green ones off Ebay which are supposed to be stronger and they are not they are bother the same! don&#x27;t pay more for the green ones!</li>
    <li> LOVE THE EMJOI UNIT AND ALWAYS NEED REFILLS</li>
    <li> Great tool for the feet. Even my husband likes it.</li>
