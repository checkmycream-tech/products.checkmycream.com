      <li>I like more.</li>
      <li>Encre Noire is my favorite cologne and everyone like the smell.</li>

      <li>I love love love the fresh warm and woodsy smell of this cologne.</li>
      <li>, it is a pretty good fragrance.</li>
      <li>Good product fast delivery</li>
      <li>somewhat strong and penetrating</li>
      <li>It is too strong.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so cheap, just buy it.</li>
      <li>At this price point there is no other fragrance as good as Encre Noire.</li>
      <li>I have used this for the past 4 years and it is just the best.</li>
      <li>Unique, winterish scent I do like to wear.</li>
      <li>It is quite a high-class and unique scent that I see this as a suit and tie affair type cologne.</li>
      <li>Unique.</li>
      <li>and I love intense &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; Vetiver.</li>
      <li>Reminds me of a damp forest in upstate Washington or Oregon on a cool, cloudy and rainy day.</li>
      <li>I have ordered fragrance before,but this was just an extra good boxing and cared for shipping experience.</li>
      <li>I get 8-10 solid hours from this on my skin with 4-5 hours of really good sillage.</li>
      <li>A very manly and unique smell and worth the price!</li>
      <li>At the price, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no disappointment when one buy Lalique Encre Noire Cologne.</li>
      <li>and I thought it was worth a try.  </li>
      <li>To be honest they smell so similar that I doubt you could tell the difference right off the bat.</li>
      <li>Oh my my my...I wanted very much to like this.</li>
      <li>Very happy with Lalique with this one amongst the other scents of theirs that I do not really care for.</li>
      <li>Not as high-note subtle as my old-time favorite (COSI), which, unfortunately is no longer on the market -- but a nice addition to my collection.</li>
      <li>first time I smelled Encre Noire</li>
      <li>I love this product, it&#x27;s been the only one that I wear since I&#x27;ve known about it.</li>
      <li>Great for the price long lasting</li>
      <li>I recommend you first will experince an essence of wood</li>
      <li>I´m using this perfume for a long time and is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Differently than other very good brands, it doesn´t change with transpiration.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe but it&#x27;s original one, I used Lalique for more than 5 years, and this time, I tried to find it on amazon, I bought it for less than a quarter of the price</li>
      <li>and I can tell it was a great deal, it scents is quite different from any other I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
      <li>Sure, Chanel Sycamore is nice, but so expensive compared to this.</li>
      <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It really grew on me.</li>
      <li>OH my, elegant classy and smokey eight hours later.</li>
      <li>I was reading the reviews of Guerlain Vetiver and this was mentioned and highly recommended.  </li>
      <li>but then it turns a little bit soften and takes a gentle masculine scent that will make more than one girl catches your eye</li>
      <li>I rarely wear it in public though</li>
      <li>This is a very unique, projecting, and long lasting scent.</li>
      <li>use a lot of perfumes and like trying out new fragrances, but I haven&#x27;t used any with such&lt;br /&gt;distinct</li>
      <li>Masculine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s earthy from the vetiver and the vetiver notes lasts the whole time from 1st spray until 6 hours later.</li>
      <li>For me, it&#x27;s not dark or mysterious but just plain wacky.</li>
      <li>I blind bought this after reading so many positive reviews...</li>
      <li>I totally &amp;#34;get&amp;#34; the people who have remarked that this smells like old baby powder, and</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know about anybody else, but to me this stuff smells EXACTLY like walking down steps into a dank basement where you might expect spider webs, mold and crusty plumber&#x27;s pipes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m shocked we can get it for such a great price.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> my fav of all the lalique brand i  wear it all the time and get great compliments on it from all around me</li>
    <li> This is a very unique, projecting, and long lasting scent. I love the woody-ink scent this cologne presents. It is a very lovely scent and is perfect for rainy days. It is quite a high-class and unique scent that I see this as a suit and tie affair type cologne. Very happy with Lalique with this one amongst the other scents of theirs that I do not really care for.</li>
    <li> I saw this on a fragrance rating website so had to give it a try.  4 stars out of 5, it is a pretty good fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love The Scent and a Really Great Value!</li>
    <li> This has to be one of my favorite fragrances. I have stuff that ranges from cheap like Bvlgari Aqva to expensive like Creed Aventus. Approaching 50+ bottles and hundreds of samples I still haven&#x27;t found a vetiver I like more. Sure, Chanel Sycamore is nice, but so expensive compared to this. To be honest they smell so similar that I doubt you could tell the difference right off the bat. This is the one scent I reach for when I want something comforting (though my description will lead you to believe otherwise). I like to wear this to bed. It&#x27;s relaxing and soothing. I rarely wear it in public though, I just feel like the majority of people wouldn&#x27;t care for it. It&#x27;s going to be a love or hate fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, Encre Noire has a dark earthy smell. It has this black inky note combined with the vetiver that makes me think of a dark old growth forest. I imagine walking through the woods around midnight with only the moon lighting your way. It&#x27;s autumn and all the trees are dead and all you can hear is the crunch of leaves beneath your feet as you walk the paths. It&#x27;s almost a haunting type of smell (Yes, I wear this every Halloween). It makes me think of a world from a book with witches, magic, and spirits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I smelled Encre Noire I did not like it. I thought why on earth would people wear this, which is probably why I&#x27;m still nervous wearing it in public. It really grew on me. For some reason I kept smelling it over and over trying to figure it out (Same reaction with Dior Fahrenheit). It was mysterious. Now I can&#x27;t possibly be without this scent and I will always have a bottle in my collection. At this price point there is no other fragrance as good as Encre Noire. It&#x27;s so cheap, just buy it.</li>
    <li> I  Love it..... As a woman, I use it myself.... never tell people is Men&#x27;s Cologne.......&lt;br /&gt;Before I&#x27;ve ordered the Lalique for Women,,,,, It wasn&#x27;t what I use to Use.......THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
    <li> This cologne is very unique and smells great.  I&#x27;m shocked we can get it for such a great price.  At this price, it is a must have!</li>
    <li> Encre Noire is my favorite cologne and everyone like the smell. There&#x27;s no disappointment when one buy Lalique Encre Noire Cologne.</li>
    <li> Great prouduct. Woodsy smell. Last a reasoable about of time.</li>
    <li> This was a blind buy and I can tell it was a great deal, it scents is quite different from any other I&#x27;ve ever smelled. 5 stars</li>
    <li> I have used this for the past 4 years and it is just the best. Lasts long as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I was reading the reviews of Guerlain Vetiver and this was mentioned and highly recommended.  It wasn&#x27;t all the expensive and I thought it was worth a try.  Bottom line, I love it.  It&#x27;s an unusual fragrance, a bit musty, and I think you&#x27;ll either love it or hate it.  This is not a fragrance that you&#x27;ll be neutral about.  At the price, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I love love love the fresh warm and woodsy smell of this cologne. It has a long lasting smell that I appreciate! Top-Notch....</li>
    <li> My wife loves the smell</li>
    <li> excellent fixation. will last for hours</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my brother who was talking about this Cologne for long time.He took a picture of his friend&#x27;s cologne and I checked most places that carried it and Amazon had the lowest price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid less than half of the price and it was delivered to my house in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy and will order more from this site</li>
    <li> I thought I had used the best perfume till a saleslady recommended I buy this.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best fragrance I have used and it probably will remain so for a while.&lt;br /&gt;I use a lot of perfumes and like trying out new fragrances, but I haven&#x27;t used any with such&lt;br /&gt;distinct woody musk scent. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Excellent! One of the best purchases I have made! This cologne exceeded my expectations! Masculine. Not overpowering. Unique. A great addition to my collection!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe but it&#x27;s original one, I used Lalique for more than 5 years, and this time, I tried to find it on amazon, I bought it for less than a quarter of the price</li>
    <li> Deep. dark and woody. Reminds me of a damp forest in upstate Washington or Oregon on a cool, cloudy and rainy day. It&#x27;s earthy from the vetiver and the vetiver notes lasts the whole time from 1st spray until 6 hours later. I get 8-10 solid hours from this on my skin with 4-5 hours of really good sillage. Great for cooler months and nights out.</li>
    <li> The worst product ever, i have bought on amazon</li>
    <li> Great for the price long lasting</li>
    <li> This was a great buy! It was shipped in record time.</li>
    <li> I was looking for this since I left Paris, and everyone loves it! A very manly and unique smell and worth the price!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about anybody else, but to me this stuff smells EXACTLY like walking down steps into a dank basement where you might expect spider webs, mold and crusty plumber&#x27;s pipes.</li>
    <li> Very strong scent that can be divisive.</li>
    <li> Unique, winterish scent I do like to wear. Great value.</li>
    <li> the fragrance is awesome!</li>
    <li> Oh my my my...I wanted very much to like this. I wear Vetiver essential oil a lot so I know what Vetiver smells like and this is not Vetiver as I know it and I love intense &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; Vetiver. I have had this scent on for one hour and it hasn&#x27;t improved. I totally &amp;#34;get&amp;#34; the people who have remarked that this smells like old baby powder, and may I say it&#x27;s not a pleasant baby powder. For me, it&#x27;s not dark or mysterious but just plain wacky. I plan to resell my bottle on ebay to recoup part of my expense. I am disappointed in this scent. I am going back to my essential oil. Definitely get a sample before you buy.  I smell the musk and but no cypress, no Vetiver or the woodsy scent, which is what I wanted. Ick, ick, ick.</li>
    <li> I blind bought this after reading so many positive reviews...but I cannot help but agree with those reviews that say it smells like a dark, damp, mildewed basement in an old house...I want to like it, but I cant help but think that no female is going to be attracted to you wearing this...except maybe morticia from the addams family.  i will try again next winter after giving it some time to grow on me...like mold</li>
    <li> I have ordered fragrance before,but this was just an extra good boxing and cared for shipping experience. I can&#x27;t believe the scent itself,as I never worn vetiver. OH my, elegant classy and smokey eight hours later. I ordered guerlain vetiver from amazon and will get tomorrow. I will be restocking my bulgari aqua. both regular and marine,oh my God have you seen prices and selection. Amazon as a fragranatic you have addicted me. Louis L bullard</li>
    <li> I recommend you first will experince an essence of wood somewhat strong and penetrating but then it turns a little bit soften and takes a gentle masculine scent that will make more than one girl catches your eye</li>
    <li> Good product fast delivery</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance and a bit more unique than many others.  Not as high-note subtle as my old-time favorite (COSI), which, unfortunately is no longer on the market -- but a nice addition to my collection.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s been the only one that I wear since I&#x27;ve known about it.</li>
    <li> one of the best men&#x27;s cologne I have ever used.Great smell, always get compliments.</li>
    <li> It is not what I smelled in my local mall.It is too strong.</li>
    <li> I´m using this perfume for a long time and is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Differently than other very good brands, it doesn´t change with transpiration.</li>
