<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was missing the clear straw piece where the product comes up and pumps out.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> It came empty...but the stuff is great</li>
    <li> Love the product!! However, there is no tube connected to the pump so I can&#x27;t pump it out. (like you do with hand soap) Not sure if the product was tampered with or if it is just an error in how it was made.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use when using the flat iron or if you have frizzy hair.  Just be sure to use a small amount or your hair will look greasy.</li>
    <li> Second time I&#x27;ve bought this item and the stem inside separates from the pump...Have to use a Q-tip to get product out</li>
    <li> Makes hair smooth, weighs it down a little. Would not buy again, especially for the rpice. Moroccon Oil works better.</li>
    <li> I use the Keratin Smoothing Product, and this product is a great addition to use daily toward keeping my hair feeling smooth without breaking down the smoothing treatment.</li>
    <li> This works great for smoothing frizzy hair. I use it every day when I notice my keratin treatment is wearing off.  It really makes your hair feel smooth and shiny especially if you use a flat iron with it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to express to the Customer Service representative that has been working with me that I am thankful that he rectified my order, and sent me the product I needed. I do appreciate the great customer service,  and I am pleased with the outcome. Thank you! If I can name names please advise with an email, and I will edit my review.</li>
    <li> Bought this product after having a Coppola Keratin treatment.  It is pricey but worth it. You only need to work a small amount into hair before blow-drying.  It makes the hair brush glide through my hair and cuts my drying time.  It has definitely extended the life of my keratin treatment.  After four months, with this cream, I can easily still get my naturally curly hair smooth and straight.</li>
    <li> I should have started to use this the day after I had my keratin treatment.  Really helps to extend the lenght of time between treatments.</li>
    <li> I just recently got the keratin treatment, and this product really works well. I use it after i get out of the shower, i first towel dry my hair and then put a little in my hair and comb it through, highly recommend. i have extremly curly, dry &amp; frizzy hair and it works great for me!</li>
    <li> Best leave in condition I have ever used.  It is not heavy or greasy. Great scent and you only need a dime size. It last about 4 month washing hair 3 times a week</li>
    <li> Smooths my hair &amp; looks shiny</li>
    <li> Yes I was happy with product and how quickly I received it</li>
    <li> I mix this product with the Infusion Keratin Repair Therapy, the two together really make my hair soft and smooth.  I will order this again.</li>
    <li> It seems that the formula has changed and I don&#x27;t like the way it feels in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The color used to be a dark orange and now it&#x27;s very light.  Not sure what has happened to this product, but it&#x27;s not the same as it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought this product 3 times through Amazon and the price has gone from $10 - $20.  Not very happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying this again through Amazon.</li>
    <li> My hair used to be dry and damaged form excess coloring/bleaching. I use this product everyday and after about 1 week my I started getting compliments from everyone on how luscious, shiny, bright and healthy my hair was - and still is! I will continue to use this product everyday until it is discontinued or I die. Haha.</li>
    <li> product is great. keeps my thick, frizzy hair in check. Never without it. Keratin is an amazing product for hair.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  Makes your hair so nice and smooth.  However, beware.  The first time I bought it, I didn&#x27;t realize there were 2 sizes.  Unfortunately, I got the 1.7 oz for the same price I could have gotten the 3.4 oz.  Before you purchase, check the size!!!</li>
    <li> my hair is very dry and frizzy. I use this after washing it to help tame the fuzz. So far, its the only product i&#x27;ve found that works with heat to keep my hair a little smooth, but it does not last overnight, by next day i&#x27;m all frizzy again. So its good, but i&#x27;m still looking for a more effective frizz tamer.</li>
    <li> WowI I love this stuff! First of all I am so happy I found this product on Amazon because I pay $50 for this product at the salon. I am amazed that I can buy it for less then $20. What! I have been jipped. LoL! This is great for color treated hair and for those that flat iron your hair. It keeps my hair from frizzing. I used to have to flat iron my hair. Now I can apply this product the night before while its wet and it keeps it tame. I have naturally wavy hair so when I used it it gives me like a relaxed wave. Then I add a hair shine to it and Wala I have a light perm. I love it.. it seems to be very healthy for hair! Thanks Amazon for saving me $$$$$$ :-)</li>
    <li> From the description, I was hoping I could find something that would both allow me to have body and bounce to my hair, while also imparting a silky feel and shine.  Since the directions said to get the best results, you need to either blow dry it in or use a flat iron.  Well, at first I did the flat iron.  It gave really great results.  It protected the hair shaft from being damaged, sealed in the keratin and moisturizers in the hair.  The serum gave me very soft silky hair with a nice shine.  But, I like to have body in my hair, so the following week, I do what I normally do, which is to blow dry, using a vented metal round brush (the kind that will actually curl your hair if the blow dryer is at the HOT setting).  I would wrap the ends of my hair around it and apply the hot air for several seconds until it gets hot to the touch.  Normally this will give me a nice bouncy curl at the end.  Well, it gave me the softness and shine, however, it refused to keep a curl in it for more than a minute or two!  I believe the serum just wont allow the hair to hold any kind of shape other than totally smooth and straight.  So, if you are looking for something that will protect your hair from high heat while making it really straight, this product will do that, and will keep it straight all day.  But if you are like me, and enjoy some bounce in your hair, you are better off not using this product and I firmly believe it should state as much somewhere on the packaging, which is why I only gave it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> My brown hair was fried from a hairstylist who tried to take it too blonde.  This was my last resort before chopping my hair off, and boy, am I glad I took the plunge!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had an actual Keratin smoothing treatment, so I&#x27;m using just this and don&#x27;t even need a flat iron! My hair is the best it&#x27;s ever looked when it&#x27;s styled.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I may just use this product until I die!</li>
    <li> Totally over-rated. it smooths down fly aways yes...but that&#x27;s about it</li>
    <li> My daughter introduced me to Keratin a couple of years ago, and I have used it ever since. It really makes a difference!</li>
    <li> I had a Coppola Express Blow Out 4 weeks ago at the salon, this product keeps it looking like I had it done yesterday.  Highly recommend along w/Coppola Keratin shampoo.  With fine wavy hair that puffs out and looks like a cotton ball in the summer I have tried it all.  This works for me and it&#x27;s not expensive, a few pumps, work through hair, blow dry and flat iron (with fine hair I use a regular flat iron) and you are good to go. Love it.</li>
    <li> When I decided to use my Keratin Complex the pump was broken and I was unable to use this product. I use to order from an other company and never had this problem before.</li>
    <li> I do a quarterly Keratin straightening salon treatment and use this to prolong the results. This product is great for that but the packaging is horrible--the pump is highly ineffective which means I basically just take the cap off and scoop it out with my fingers. Seriously, get it together guys--I&#x27;m already paying a premium for a tiny amount of product, I should be at least be able to get my every last cent&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> The pump on the bottle never worked.  I had to unscrew it and try to get the keratin out of the bottle like a catsup bottle.</li>
    <li> Suggested by stylist on Cruise and wife likes the way it makes her hair feel and it helps make it easy to style and the style lasts for 2-3 days!!  Good Product as well as other Keratin Complex Products she has just discovered and will never be out of again!!</li>
    <li> I use this on dry hair to give it a textured look.  Smells great and works good.  A small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have two daughters, one with very fine hair and a super sensitive head (no joke, the poor thing cries every morning when we brush her hair). We have tried so many products to help sooth her hair and make combing and brushing easier. Until now, nothing worked. She loves her hair LONG which became nearly impossible since morning brushing resulted in tears and frustration for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It got to the point where I took her to the hair salon to get her hair cut. The lovely lady there suggested we try this product before I cut her hair. We put 5 squirts of the stuff into my daughter&#x27;s hand and had her put it in herself (so that she knows how to do this in the future). She worked it in her hair starting at the roots and working her way up. When she was done, I took the brush and brushed through her hair. The tangles were so easy to brush through that I was absolutely shocked. Her hair is shinier, sleeker and so much easier to comb/brush/style!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is perfect. I must have for all hair types. I bought a bottle at the salon (and paid more than $40 for it!) and then found the same exact product here! I ordered two more bottles (one for each bathroom in the house). We love this stuff. It makes our mornings so much easier. The kids actually ask me to do their hair now and neither one of them gripes, cries or complains when I pull the brush through their hair. I strongly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Love this product..buy it regularly.</li>
    <li> Perfect if you want to straighten your hair ...or not. Leaves your hair silky smooth without feeling greasy throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I love this product...I use to buy it from my hair styles but found it on here for half the price</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER! THIS WAS A TOTAL RIP OFF. PRODUCT HAD NO DISPENSER PUMP AND WAS TOTALLY USELESS BECAUSE YOU CANT GET IT OUT OF THE BOTTLE. THIS IS AN OLD PROBLEM OF COPPOLA MANUFACTURING THAT WAS FIXED A LONG TIME AGO. THIS SELLER IS CONTINUING TO PEDAL DEFECTIVE, OLD PRODUCT ONLINE. BUYER BEWARE.</li>
    <li> The pump came broken and I have to use an instrument to get the serum out. :(</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about purchasing this product because of the &amp;#34;mixed reviews&amp;#34;, but was so desperate to find a &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34; to my hair issues.  I purchased it anyway and it was nearly impossible to get the product out. Yes, everyone said that.  I had to purchase a spatula type thing to even get some of it out and it was thick and gooey.  For my hair length, (just past my shoulders), I would be finished with this product in 5 days.  Expensive and not worth the trouble.</li>
    <li> Great product for heat stressed hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, especially for curly haired gals.</li>
    <li> IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT. ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO HAVE NATURAL CURLY HAIR.EXCELLENT!!!!i have use this product for over 3years...</li>
    <li> Very good product, I recommended it 100%.The product is of good quality and exactly as described here and fast arrived. my hair stay smooth and manageable.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Started using it on my hair, and when I started wearing extensions and they started looking a little dry, I tried it on them.  Wow, amazing results and freshened them like they were new.</li>
    <li> Bought this product before but this time bought 2 bottles. 1 was fine but the other was runny and watery not like the cream I got before. Won&#x27;t buy here again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 years. I save at least 50% of what I used to pay at the salon. It&#x27;s very light and keeps my hair smooth.</li>
    <li> If you get salon keratin treatments, this product will help extend and enhance the effects of your treatment. A must have for curly/frizzy hair even if you don&#x27;t get the salon treatment.</li>
    <li> This product helps with my frizzy hair. I use a few pumps and blow dry my hair and it makes a big difference</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times and already notice a huge difference. It makes your hair soft and smooth. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Makes my hair feel well nourished.  Takes away any dryness and frizziness.</li>
    <li> Dried up in the bottle, even after returning it once before.</li>
    <li> Whenever I feel like I want to straighten my hair I always add a small dab of this product.  The Coppola Infusion Keratin is sealed into the hair bringing about a good shine and managable hair.  No frizzies when I apply this prior to the flat iron.  ANd I live in Alabama where humidity is the major part of the weather here in the summer.  Good product and smells nice.  I also feel like the Coppola product is not as hard on the hair as other Keratin Infusion Products.  Seems softer.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS GREAT ON EITHER DRY OR WET HAIR.  IT ELIMINATES FRIZZ ON CONTACT ON DRY HAIR AND ON WET HAIR IS FANTASTIC..IT GIVES SHINE, BOUNCE AND ENHANCES YOUR NATURAL CURLS.</li>
    <li> I have to say I just love Coppola products, always have. But I was a little disappointed with this product. I have very curly, very long frizzy hair, this product works good, but does not tame my frizz very well. I love the way it makes my hair very soft. however the frizz is just not controlled as well as the serums I was using prior to using this product. If you leave this product in your hair with out blow drying it has a tendency to make my ends very dry. I flat iron my hair to make it straight, and it definitely  protects the cuticle from damage, but I don&#x27;t think its as good as I hoped for it to be. I find that within a few hours my hair is poufy with frizz, and I have had multiple keritan treatments, and I am at the tail end of my current keritan treatment, so that might be why its not holding as well. However, my hair is in very good shape and I am diligent in taking very good care of my hair.  I think everyone has different experiences with different products. This is just not strong enough for what I am looking to achieve. I think trying their Infusion RX in the black bottle might just pack the punch I need to tame the frizz and have the same softening and protection effects.</li>
    <li> This is maybe even better than [[ASIN:B0041R7C4A Global Keratin Serum 1.69oz]] and I thought that was a great product.  Just a little bit worked into clean, towel-dried hair leaves it very manageable and frizz-free.  I live in a high-humidity area and have very dry, gray hair that tends to frizz.  This and the GK serum are two of the best products I have used to keep the curling and frizzing under control.  It leaves the hair soft and smooth and I love it.  My only objection is the smell.  It has a coconut fragrance and I don&#x27;t like to smell like food.  But it&#x27;s worth living with the smell to have such manageable hair.</li>
    <li> This product is very good for your hair after a keratin treatment. The replenisher will give you the look like you had the keratin treatment the same week.:)</li>
    <li> I have used this product before.  It helps control hair in summertime humidity.  The downside is, you have to wash your hair more often, it gets dirty more quickly.</li>
    <li> The item received is not useable. I have tried to use the pump and it is not pumping anything out. When I opened the pump the product inside was completely dried out (I tried scooping some out with a Q-Tip only to hit rock-hard goo). This is unacceptable and has taken out precious time and energy to return the item .. DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> fantastic--makes my frizzy hair straight and silky. will use it everytime I wash my hair. best product ever used. great</li>
    <li> Conditions without heaviness.</li>
    <li> I paid 27 dollars I just used twice and the bottle is empty.  so never ever again buy this product from this way online .</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I get my hair straightened and this product works great to keep my hair straight and frizz-free.  However, there is another merchant on Amazon who sells the 3.4 ounces for almost the same cost as the 1.7 ounces.  Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did.  Make sure you get your money&#x27;s worth and order the 3.4 ounces.  The bottle may look slightly different, but look closely at what it is called and you will see that it is the same exact product.</li>
    <li> I have a keratin treatment on my very long curly frizzy hair.  The brand my hairdresser uses is supposed to last 5 months.  But because of the kind of hair I have I was having to go back every three months.  Then I discovered this product.  Now that I use this in-between treatments I&#x27;ve been able to get 5 months out of the original process.</li>
    <li> Product works well.  I get the real keratin treatment every 4-5 months but this has been a nice product as I get closer to needing to get the longer treatment.</li>
    <li> I cannot live without this product.  I use it every day, calms down an awkward wave and lifts up the crown.</li>
    <li> I am very particular about what I put in my hair, I am of African American decent and can say this product has done wonders for my hair. It leaves my hair smooth and shiny without weighing it down. A little goes a long way and I love the pump bottle, it gives you exactly the right amount of product. I use the Pureology Essential Repair Shampoo and Conditioner Duo then add this to damp hair along with Redkins all soft Argon oil. The 3 together have brought my hair from dull and dry to incredible health !&lt;br /&gt;I am always getting compliments on how healthy my hair looks! If you want your hair to look super smooth and silky, BUY IT, YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPONTED!!!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my hair dresser. Helps keep hair healthy and shiny. Use with Coppola shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few months now and love it.  I use as directed after shampooing, conditioning and towel drying.  My hair looks and feels smoother than ever.  Sometimes I don&#x27;t even bother to flat iron it.  With this product, round brushing and drying are sufficient.  While my hair is fairly long, it is no longer thick.  I use a bit more than I would have thought to get good results.  It means I will use it quicker than I originally thought.  Regardless, given the thousands of dollars I have spent over a life time of looking for great hair products, I have to say I&#x27;m happy with this and will likely  not change to anything else in the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Keratin Express process on my hair several times; the Keratin Replenisher helps to extend the process several weeks beyond the eight week recommendation.  I love the scent and especially the packaging; the dispenser mechanism makes sure that you get every last drop and the clear bottle let&#x27;s you know when it is time to reorder.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, but it is very expensive.  I think you can find others that are cheaper.  I probably will not re-order it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem like the original I purchased from my hair dresser that I LOVE. Just ok.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!! My daughters hair wasn&#x27;t growing because of using a straightener, this product works. Her hair is growing and smells great. She won&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t make straightening my hair any easier and it didn&#x27;t make it less frizzy but I&#x27;m not sure if it will help extend the life of my keratin treatment. If it does, I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have thick, dark, fine, but frizzy hair (probably too much blow drying and flat ironing).  I use the Coppola Keratin Color Care Shampoo and Conditioner and this product.  Both have played a role in restoring a healthy shine to my hair.  I&#x27;ve seen a dramatic improvement.  Others have commented on this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Greatly reduced frizz&lt;br /&gt;- Has not affected my hair color&lt;br /&gt;- Restored shine to hair&lt;br /&gt;- Wonderful styling product for straightening my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- If I don&#x27;t shampoo the second day and flat iron to touch up, it loses its fragrance and smells somewhat unpleasant&lt;br /&gt;- Gets expensive since I have thick, past shoulder length hair and it takes 10 - 12 pumps to cover all of it sufficiently&lt;br /&gt;- If I apply too much it weighs down my hair and makes it look and feel greasy (not really a CON about the product, just a note)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note this is NOT that for me, this is not just a conditioner, but specifically works well for straightening and flat ironing.  In the amount I use it weighs down my hair, which is what I wanted .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, on my 3rd or 4th bottle.  Great stuff</li>
    <li> The infusion keeps my hair smooth and shiny.  Be careful not to use too much of the product.  It can become greasy.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  My goal was a product that will smooth out my frizzy hair &amp; this is not it.  Just more money wated on hair products.</li>
    <li> Love this!  Adds a smoothness and shine to my hair.  Will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This smells so good, like coconut. Makes my hair appear healthy and hydrated, soft and bouncy and beautiful. Love it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE, LOVE my Coppola products! I started getting Keratin treatments and my stylist told me I had to have this product to help the longevity of my treatment. This product really does help and it smells really good too. I can tell the difference in my hair when I have run out and am waiting to get more-it just isn&#x27;t the same. For my natural not curly, but not straight hair, it is a lifesaver!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it often because I highlighted my hair and maybe it&#x27;s just me but the color of this product I believe effected my highlights ...I thought when I ordered it the picture showed a clear substance in the bottle ...anyway it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> I am surprised to have to say don&#x27;t buy from Fragrance Net. They sent me a product that did not smell correctly, more like rancid coconut oil,  and  the bottle did not pump the product out. I have used this for several years and it is a wonderful product for frizz, but the seller probably had some  storage problem.</li>
    <li> If you have had a Keratin treatment put in your hair then it wonderful &amp; mandatory to add life to your expensive treatment, use only if you are getting Keratin treatment.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Product, I have been using this for over 3 years, and it still works great. Makes my hair shine and helps with keeping it healthy!!!</li>
    <li> Turns witch hair into real hair</li>
    <li> A truly amazing product! Don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else, this product is worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;Will turn over-processed, dried out &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; into silk, every time!</li>
    <li> I use this everytime I shampoo to preserve my keratin treatment.  It works well, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.  I also use the shampoo and conditioner from this brand.  I am not sure how much it helps with frizz so may still need a separate product for that.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It was recommended to me by my stylist after I received a Keratin straightening.  You need to use a lot to make a difference.  It is supposed to help extend the life of your Keratin treatment, but I am not sure if it actually does.  If you have short hair (above shoulders) then it will probably last a while otherwise I just think you use the bottle up very quickly.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I have wavy hair and use Keratin Complex treatments to smooth and straighten my hair. This product makes my hair soft and smooth when the treatments begin to fade away.  I agree with the other reviewers that this will makes your hair straighter so don&#x27;t use it if you want your hair to hold curl.  A little goes a long way, so this tube has lasted a long time.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before I love it. I received fast shipping, disappointed in the size there wasn&#x27;t a description of the size. When I went to use it the pump wouldn&#x27;t work I tried everything possible.</li>
    <li> when I first used this I don&#x27;t think that I used enough. It did work well if I use a little more. I can tell a difference. More shine and manages better. I wish it were not so expensive though.</li>
    <li> I received this product and was able to squirt out enough for one treatment.  My hair was left greasy and limp with no life in it.  Then the packaging failed and I couldn&#x27;t squirt out any more product.  I returned it to Amazon and am grateful they refunded my money.  This is NOT a good replenisher and isn&#x27;t even slightly a substitute for a keratin/Brazilian treatment.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> The words a dab will do you come into play when using this product.  If you have a keratin treatment, this will help make the treatment last and control any frizz that you may have.  I couldnt live without it.</li>
    <li> Works well, but very expensive, as you&#x27;ll find the whole bottle will only give you maybe 10 pumps for your hair if it&#x27;s long like mine.  Definitely recommend it though!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Leaves the hair super soft and shiny. My favorite part is you can never use too much. It never feels like you have product in your hair</li>
    <li> I looove this product! It&#x27;s one of the few things that work in my poor colored hair. However... the last time I bought it here, I got a product that I&#x27;m quite certain it was a fake. I didn&#x27;t want to believe the previous reviews, but yep, I also didn&#x27;t get the original product. There was no packaging (the original comes in a box) and the texture and color were very different! - I still have the original, which I had bought at Bed Bath and Beyond... really different... I&#x27;m trying to get my money back (still no reply from them, after 3 weeks!) and I will never buy anything with Salons Best ever again!! Amazon should be watchful!</li>
    <li> Best home treatment ever!!! Dear Mr Coppola: Please continue making this product so that DIY women can have salon looking hair in the comfort of their homes.</li>
    <li> I love the product and hate the packaging.  I can&#x27;t get the product out of the container.  The pump doesn&#x27;t work properly!</li>
    <li> is very good product for the hair, is the best for complement to keratin treatment!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love my hair with infusion keratin</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great product....</li>
    <li> So I was very skeptical of this product. I rarely ever come across a hair leave in treatment that works wonders on my hair, but this one was it! To give you a little background on my hair, it is coarse, wiry &amp; extremely thick dark brown hair. Let&#x27;s just say, every girl&#x27;s nightmare - especially when you combine that with South Florida&#x27;s lovely humidity.. Every 6 months I do the Japanese (Liscio) straightening, so on my 4th month I really needed something strong to hep me deal with the out of control roots.. So I gave this stuff a try. I found it on Follica&#x27;s website at first and read up on suggested instructions from one of the staff, which I followed to the T and experienced amazing results. Here is what they advised:&lt;br /&gt;After shampooing, conditioning and towel drying, apply the product and comb through to distribute evenly.. Put your hair up and cover with a plastic cap for 20 minutes or so. They basically suggested to apply heat, which is achieved thru the shower cap or even adding a blow dryer. Then proceed with styling ending it with a flat iron. I was really blown away. I haven&#x27;t been using the Keratin shampoo and conditioner but now I think I&#x27;ll give it a shot to see if it&#x27;s up to par.</li>
    <li> This has been on of my all time favorite hair products.  I have curly/frizzy unmanageable hair, beautiful if it&#x27;s styled, but really, one whiff of humidity and it&#x27;s ruined!  No more.  This makes my hair look sleek, and in higher humidity my hair holds up better.  I actually had a Brazilian blow out, for a lot of money, and this product did as good, if not better at controlling my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It is part of my regimen to care for my keratin treated hair. The product arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> The packaging was different than advertised.  I bought this for years because I could SEE how much was gone before reordering.  With this new packaging, you can&#x27;t see the product and I just finished what I ordered Dec 29 and it didn&#x27;t last as long as the bottle you have the picture of.  It appears there is less in it (AND I can&#x27;t see how much was in it).  I use the same amount each day so I know how long it is to last.  I feel ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to see if the company has anything to say about this.  I love the product but hate being ripped off by hiding something with the packaging.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Makes your hair so shiny to the point that people thinks that you hair looks like wet paint. Keratin it&#x27;s definitely a component that your hair needs at all times</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, and a lot of it.  It is wavy to curly and tends to frizz at the slightest humidity.  This product does a very good job of keeping the frizz to a minimum - even in rain.  For my fine hair, just a little tiny pea sized dab does it, rubbed into damp hair.  Straightens nicely, or just to keep the frizzies away.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say the product is in it early stage if usage</li>
    <li> love this product....can&#x27;t find it anymore</li>
    <li> I love the product but it is extremely difficult to get out of the container.  I am not sure if it is always this thick or the 3rd party seller did not care for it properly.  But it does not come out of the pump- it is so thick I get it out with a stick- its the consistancy of pudding but rubbed in my hands and applied to the hair- the product itself is fantastci.  I would definitely buy it again despite the difficulty in getting it out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do.  I apply to my towel dried hair, after I blow dry I reapply to my dry hair and flat iron.  My hair will remain straight until I wash it again.</li>
    <li> Great product but not for my hair type. I used it once and it flattened my hair out too much. It took a week to get back to normal.</li>
    <li> I know I am supposed to use this to help my keratin blowout last longer, and I like the product except for one thing - it seems like even using a small amount makes my hair feel dirty sooner than if I use another sulfate free product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product I am glad I found it! I would defiantly recommend it to anyone that has damaged or frizzy hair</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t the same as the bottle I bought in the salon.  The color was off and the ingredients were different.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist recommended this for my hair last time she highlighted it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and I swear my hair is in better condition than it&#x27;s ever been.  I only use it if I blow-dry, however.  I leave it out of my routine if I air-dry my hair.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about the review of this product and thought I would order and try it.  What I didn&#x27;t realize is that you are paying $18.00 plus shipping ($6.00) for very little product which arrived last week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t believe the bottle size was so tiny for a daily hair product.  I think that is rip off no matter how good people say it is if the manufacturer charges us so much for very little. I have moderate curly hair and I wanted to use a daily product that would straighten my hair without having to pay for an expensive straighten treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading the reviews, I thought I would give this product a try.  It arrived last week, when I opened the package...my god...could they make this bottle any smaller?  Really, for a daily hair product? Way to take advantage of the consumer!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and used a small about on my wet hair.  Did it really straighten it after I dryed my hair?  Not really, what it did do is take out frizz which I have plenty of cheaper products that do that.  Very disappointed with the claim of the product, peoples reviews and the amount of product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want frizz control buy it but remember you will have to buy this product very frequently, it might last you a month or month and a half at $18.00+ $6.00 x 5 months &#x3D; $120.00.  So, 10 months you would have spent close to $240.00 so they get you either way.  Coppola&#x27;s salon straightening treatment cost $300.00 and lasts 4-5 months depending on your hair type.  I know it is difficult to have curly hair and you want straight hair but if money is no option...spend away!  Personally, money is not a problem...for me it is the principle of the manufacturer taking advantage of the consumer this way.</li>
    <li> A great product.  A quality item. I am incredibly happy with this purchase. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in buying on for themselves.</li>
    <li> Great product that keeps the frizz down here in Houston, Tx.</li>
    <li> I love Keratin Coppola Complex Infusion but this is price gouging. This is a tiny 1.7 oz container. I pay this price at the salon for a 12 oz. My bad! I&#x27;m a amazonaholic and know better. :-(</li>
    <li> This stuf smells like dish detergent but it works well. I just can&#x27;t deal with the smell. Its also really thick which isnt what I was expecting. I wouldnt buy it again</li>
    <li> Moved to another state, tried to find a salon and its staff that knew how to care for fine hair that has been processed blonde with high and low lights. Unfortunately, I found the wrong one. My hair was extremely damaged to the point of falling out and breakage. I remembered my old salon used this product. Found it on Amazon.Just a dab will do and my hair immediately felt healthy and looked great. Friend for life!</li>
    <li> I have keratin treated hair and it&#x27;s nice to use this product in between treatments to keep my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> I use to buy this religiously and then one day I tried the Chi Keratin Complex and have since stop using this product over that one. The Chi smells better and is more of a fusion of a keratin product with Moroccan oil....I simply prefer that now, but these are all personal decisions. You can buy the travel size of the Chi product and compare.</li>
