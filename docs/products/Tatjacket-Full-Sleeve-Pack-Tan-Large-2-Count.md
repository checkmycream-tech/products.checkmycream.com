      <li>It doesn&#x27;t slip and stays comfortable.</li>
      <li>br /&gt;Its comfortable and breathes well</li>
      <li>me just say the sleeves do fit my arm size and the mediums would probably cut off circulation so they are not an option.</li>
      <li>I can pull it up all the way to my armpit and then have to roll it over to make it fit comfortably.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable but wierd feeling at first.</li>
      <li>A way to cover up your creative expression and discriminate against a certain group of people.</li>
      <li>These sleeves not only are good for on the job when discression is needed, but they preserve the color when out in the sun.  </li>
      <li>I had been looking for a product like this as I have a full sleeve and others</li>
      <li>, I just run them under cool tap water and they feel like I just dunked them in an ice bath.  </li>
      <li>sweat to help keep my leg cool</li>
      <li>They cover up great and are not hot at all.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a size large and the first time I wore them they stayed up for the most part, not the case today.</li>
      <li>luckily I picked the right size.</li>
      <li>great fit, my husband was very pleased.he can go to work without getting in ny trouble.</li>
      <li>They are worth every penny you pay for them</li>
      <li>but it was worth it.</li>
      <li>they are way more comfortable than wearing long sleeve uniforms</li>
      <li>Leaves a cool feeling no matter how much sun hits your arm.</li>
      <li>It is very consealing and cool to touch.</li>
      <li>Did the job of covering the tattoos, but the elastic at the top stretched out very easily and had to be constantly pulled up throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Hot</li>
      <li>First and foremost this product is as it is described.</li>
      <li>That stay up pretty well..</li>

      <li>and he even told other employees where to purchase their own set.</li>
      <li>Yet, I am pretty large.</li>
      <li>i would have listened to the other reviews and go one size smaller than you think you need, other wise good product.</li>
      <li>The TatJackets actually attracted more attention than my tattoos normally do.</li>
      <li>staff love them - say they are much cooler than long sleeves</li>
      <li>but how was I supposed to know if I needed a medium or a large?</li>
      <li>Perhaps I should have just gotten Medium instead of Large though.</li>
      <li>I have a large rotation of uniforms</li>
      <li>so really I don&#x27;t know why I am bothering with this review.....</li>
      <li>the Tat Jackets is the fact that they lost form and my boss eased into the idea of not covering my tattoos as much.</li>
      <li>Really looks like Nude skin from a distance.</li>
      <li>Thanks Tatjacket for creating a way to help those of us who deal with this problem.</li>
      <li>And fast shipping</li>
      <li>The ever changing tattoo policy at my work really keeps me on my toes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product. Does the job of cover up.</li>
    <li> I should have gotten a size smaller than what I expected would fit. My bad. Love the product and have used it for many events. Leaves a cool feeling no matter how much sun hits your arm. I do not get hot and sweaty like i would have expected.</li>
    <li> Warning, this is not to be worn on healing tatts, cuz it will staing the sleeve and can mess-up your tattoo. First and foremost this product is as it is described. A cover-up for any arm tattoo&#x27;s that would show from under a shirt. It is very consealing and cool to touch. I can really feel the difference in temperature from each arm if I&#x27;m only wearing one. The covered arm actually feels cooler than the uncovered arm. It does do a great job of covering any tattoo&#x27;s you don&#x27;t want seen. Now on the other hand if your tattoo is very colorful or has a lot of ink the it will still be visible, but, only slightly and if you look real hard. If someone doesn&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s there then they won&#x27;t notice it. Now, for me personally the sleeve is actually a little to tight on my bi-cep. I think wearing it all day might cut-off a little circulation. It&#x27;s very comfortable but wierd feeling at first. Next, again this probably pertains to a lot of people but the color doesn&#x27;t match my skin tone at all. It says tan but, I think they mean \\&quot;not pale\\&quot;. when i wore this to work i got a ton of questions as to what I was wearing and why. So, in that situation you couldn&#x27;t see my ink but, the sleeve was the center of attention. Be aware of the color you get, tan or black, not much choice. I might have paint a negative picture but, this really is a great product and I am also going to buy the black sleeve aswell. The tan sleeve i have now i wear under light colored long sleeve shirst to work so underneath what is a semitransparent shirt all you see is a tan color. Bottom line; get it if your ink shows underneath your shirts because it will hide them. But, if you wear a short sleeve shirt it will still be noticeable that you are wearing something on your arm(s).</li>
    <li> Very happy with tat sleeves. After a long day the elastic can get uncomfortable. All in all very happy with product.</li>
    <li> We used these for my husband&#x27;s Popeye Halloween costume. We just rolled cotton batting around his arms then put these on over it, drew on an anchor tattoo and that&#x27;s it. They looked great and were comfortable. Wish they would have been cheaper as they were only for a costume but it was worth it.</li>
    <li> I wear these all summer long to work to cover my ink.  I love em!  They block the sun and are nice and cool.  they are way more comfortable than wearing long sleeve uniforms and they&#x27;re not messy like sun screen.  I do have to pull them up occasionaly throughout the day, but its not too bad.  I have 2 pairs and highly recomend them.</li>
    <li> great product for those in corporate  industry or anyone looking to cover up some tattoos for a while police officers military and such. i have big arms and thought the product might be too small but it fits perfect.thanks for the great product.</li>
    <li> These sleeves not only are good for on the job when discression is needed, but they preserve the color when out in the sun.  No fading.  I am protecting my investment without putting on creams.  The sleeves look like a t-shirt beneath your shirt.  Very nice.  I always have a pair with me.</li>
    <li> Did the job of covering the tattoos, but the elastic at the top stretched out very easily and had to be constantly pulled up throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Since my husband has to cover his tattoo at work, he needed something. This tat jacket works great. It doesn&#x27;t slip and stays comfortable. Amazon offered a great price and fast shipping</li>
    <li> It covers my ink perfectly!!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something like this for a while.  I live in Arizona and it&#x27;s not fun to have to wear long sleeves to work everyday.  I ordered a large because I went off the other reviews and how they said it fit, but wish I had went with a medium.  I can pull it up all the way to my armpit and then have to roll it over to make it fit comfortably.  I have a bright, colorful sleeve and you cannot tell I have ink when I wear this.  My arm stays surprisingly cooler than my uncovered arm.  My only gripe is that halfway thru my day I have to pull it back up as it starts to fall down after a few hours of wear.  I have already washed it once and it still looks good.  A lot of my clients with ink have asked where they can get one and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to cover their tats.</li>
    <li> These \\&quot;sleeves\\&quot; are perfect for me.  The fact that they breathe and don&#x27;t make me sweat more than I do already is the best part.  If I am running around in the heat and I want to cool down, I just run them under cool tap water and they feel like I just dunked them in an ice bath.  The evaporation cools down my arms instantaneously.&lt;br /&gt;These TatJackets are the shizzle.</li>
    <li> They work as they should and the cuff fits my arms well. They cover up great and are not hot at all. The ever changing tattoo policy at my work really keeps me on my toes. They sit in my locker and wait to be used. They are worth every penny you pay for them and  they are what they are. A way to cover up your creative expression and discriminate against a certain group of people. Thanks Tatjacket for creating a way to help those of us who deal with this problem. They are great product and company.</li>
    <li> bought second one need another pair love these wish i didnt need it but i needs to get paid. again size is large but they seem to wear out faster in the bigger sizes.</li>
    <li> Bought the black one for winter and these for summer for my husband, both his boss and him where ecstatic about them and he even told other employees where to purchase their own set.</li>
    <li> Works great. Looks great would recommend to anyone who ha to cover their tats up. Which is a shame but gotta please the job</li>
    <li> I was recommended to this item. Its great coverage but how was I supposed to know if I needed a medium or a large? I have never needed anything to have to need an &#x27;arm sizing&#x27; luckily I picked the right size. Its a good firm hold for the first few uses and then it doesn&#x27;t want to stay put. I have to keep pulling it up. I work in the restaurant business; I cannot stop every 30mins to fix it because I&#x27;ll have to wash my hands and get new gloves&#x3D;too much of a hassle to keep up with; The last time I wore them I just took them off after 3 hours of that game. My boss seemed okay with it so I guess the benefit to getting the Tat Jackets is the fact that they lost form and my boss eased into the idea of not covering my tattoos as much. Now I have to have them covered at least mid forearm and I don&#x27;t use the jackets so really I don&#x27;t know why I am bothering with this review.....</li>
    <li> Perfect!! What more can I say!  When I need to make another purchase, I&#x27;ll be back again and again.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> excellent , very happy</li>
    <li> i got these because i got tattoos on my forearms and have t cover them for work. These are great they keep your arms cool and granted they get more attention then my actual tattoos but that&#x27;s not the point. i recomend getting these if you have to cover your tattoos for work</li>
    <li> My old fashioned work place was up in arms over my butterfly and flower tattoo sleeve.  This cover keeps them happy and me employed</li>
    <li> Perfect just what I wanted good quality good fit</li>
    <li> Not a great color. Looks awkward with most outfits but it is an option.</li>
    <li> Worked nicely, Thank you</li>
    <li> i like these. (well not really im forced to wear them for work) they do there job, i have alot of tattoos that are full black some with just a hint of color. they do what they say they hide them so no one sees them. i would have listened to the other reviews and go one size smaller than you think you need, other wise good product.</li>
    <li> good fit, good product. Covers tat like it should and also worked great at protecting fresh ink from the suns uv rays as I drove through the desert.</li>
    <li> These are awsome can&#x27;t see through them like others. And fast shipping</li>
    <li> I purchased these along with the black ones for my Grand Daughters for work they had to&lt;br /&gt;cover tats and they love then and they are not to warm for them</li>
    <li> The elastic bites a bit and the closest skin color leaves my arms looking jaundiced, but this product is okay for informal wear.</li>
    <li> They cover the tattoos pretty well though my black tattoos can still be seen through the sleeve just slightly. The top of the sleeve gets loose and slides down my arm some eventually. Perhaps I should have just gotten Medium instead of Large though. Yet, I am pretty large.</li>
    <li> worked! - staff love them - say they are much cooler than long sleeves</li>
    <li> They are awesome! !!!!!</li>
    <li> Terrible product, loose fitting, doesn&#x27;t cover full length of arm from below shoulder to wrist properly. Went by measurements advertised to match size and it was a complete fail. Don&#x27;t waste your time with this below par product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed!!</li>
    <li> As management I am required to cover my tattoos and I can still see them through the tat jacket&lt;br /&gt;But not enough to be a problem&lt;br /&gt;Its comfortable and breathes well&lt;br /&gt;Also wicks away sweat to help keep my leg cool&lt;br /&gt;Most people don&#x27;t even notice I have it on</li>
    <li> Great product! Very comfortable.</li>
    <li> These sleeves work like a charm. I didn&#x27;t use them to cover tatoos, but to shield my arms from sunlight when driving because of a skin allergy. I&#x27;m not going to tell you that no one will know you&#x27;re wearing them, but they don&#x27;t stand out because of a great fit.</li>
    <li> Not bad but lose elastic over a few months of you have a high activity job</li>
    <li> I have to say I had high hopes for the TatJacket tattoo covers but they have been disappointing. Let me state that I have had these only THREE days and they are a let down! I was recently employed by a company that does not allow visible tattoos...For the first month I just wore a long sleeve shirt under my uniform (short sleeve) shirt which was hell. Hot and I wasn&#x27;t allowed to roll my sleeves up so I decided to try TatJacket. Now, $20 isn&#x27;t all that bad, especially since you *should* be able to use these over and over for the long term so the price is decent (if they work out for you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tattoos are visible through the sleeve. Only when you are close but visible enough that my manager says it barely makes the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a size large and the first time I wore them they stayed up for the most part, not the case today. They do not want to stay all the way up. They keep moving down and I don&#x27;t know about you but stopping every 10 minutes to correct a wardrobe malfunction at work is not only a pain in the ass but pretty unacceptable. The tan color is HORRID and is the same color of bandages. I had several customers gasp and ask what happened and why I was wearing bandages and/or compression stockings on my arms. The TatJackets actually attracted more attention than my tattoos normally do. Also not acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my second day they wouldn&#x27;t stay up and my tattoos ended up being visible as they weren&#x27;t covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say the sleeves do fit my arm size and the mediums would probably cut off circulation so they are not an option. I have no idea why they won&#x27;t stay up, I guess from moving around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sleeves get dirty easily and after wearing them through two shifts I can tell they need to be washed and probably will need to be done so frequently. I have a large rotation of uniforms so it sucks I have to wash these more often than uniforms, but what can I do? I refuse to buy a second set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seams are already coming undone around the wrist. There was some loose strings and I noticed the seam around the wrist is coming undone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also these are not seamless as implied. There is a lovely long line down the middle of the sleeves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last thing: There is a lovely logo on the sleeves that look like a banner tattoo which is just plain stupid as it&#x27;s meant to cover tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am terribly disappointed with this purchase and can&#x27;t believe what a let down these things are.are already coming undone around the wrist.

    <li> That stay up pretty well.. but aren&#x27;t as breathable as I&#x27;d hoped, overall not too bad. There&#x27;s no directions for care of the product either. I need more for work, and I work 12 hour shifts, so I guess I should expand my horizons. As I do more thorough research this time, since I&#x27;ll actually have some time this time around, we&#x27;ll see what I come up with.</li>
    <li> They were a different color than pictured, stretched out so the biceps were as wide as the wrists and they wouldn&#x27;t let me return them.</li>
    <li> covers what &#x27;work&#x27; says I have to cover nicely</li>
    <li> Too awesome. Really looks like Nude skin from a distance. Fits great and does not slip, which was a concern of mine</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, I had my doubts but once it out here i was amazed!  Also said that I would get it in a week......... They lied.... I got it in about 5 days.... I recommend this company to anyone.</li>
    <li> great fit, my husband was very pleased.he can go to work without getting in ny trouble. very pleased in the price</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a product like this as I have a full sleeve and others tattoos I have to cover. This is great you can pull them on and off in seconds.</li>
