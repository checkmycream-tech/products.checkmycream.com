### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>(LOVE IT)!!!!</li>
      <li>PERFECT ..</li>
      <li>but, I have them for the best price.</li>
      <li>Voila, perfect.</li>
      <li>I recommend this product is of very good quality.</li>
      <li>Works great.  </li>
      <li>Very handy tool to have around.</li>
      <li>I can access the gamsol with one hand and that is very handy.</li>
      <li>Good for cleaning flux off of connections.</li>
      <li>also good in board repair.</li>
      <li>If it does a good job I&#x27;ll be buying one of these to dispense alcohol for cleaning circuit boards and assemblies.</li>
      <li>but it seems to be awesome because I see salons use them when I get my nails done which is pretty often.</li>
      <li>And they seems to work pretty awesome</li>
      <li>very easy and convenient to use for any liquid.</li>
      <li>This was great at first, but the straw on the inside has a crack on it and after one use it</li>
      <li>I love the bottle, but be prepared to lose about a quarter of your acetone a week from evaporation.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve discovered it can be used for more than just alcohol or polish remover.</li>
      <li>Love it for my acrylic liquid</li>
      <li>The top doesn&#x27;t even close.</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>just needed more of them.</li>
      <li>Cheap and yet does what it needs too!</li>
      <li>The top started rusting after a week.</li>
      <li>The water came out on the top</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m excited!</li>
      <li>It squirts liquid up instead of lightly filling the top.</li>
      <li>but that can be easily cleaned.</li>
      <li>I am happy with this purchase, and will most likely repurchase when needed.  </li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t let it fall on it&#x27;s side &amp; it will be fine.</li>
      <li>They do however work just fine.</li>
      <li>I was so happy when I finally received my nail polish remover dispense bottle.</li>
      <li>Cheap knock off.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Considering the price &amp; free shipping</li>
      <li>cheaply made, leaks, plastic container.  </li>
      <li>Item was exactly as described, and was a very good buy, considering similar items cost three times the price at stores in the US.</li>
      <li>SUPER cheaply made.</li>
      <li>the top is very flimzy and have to play with it to get it to work</li>
      <li>Not bad for the price</li>
      <li>Quick delivery (received within 4 days to Ohio)</li>
      <li>Perfect for my wife&#x27;s alcohol, acetone and other medicinal and beauty related products.</li>
      <li>The priceis also RIGHT ;-}</li>
      <li>You just have to give it a couple pushes at first when you first fill it up so the nail polish gets through the tube !</li>
      <li>It jingles loudly, and spills easily.</li>
      <li>it worked at first</li>
      <li>Thank you for your shipping soon actually this product I love</li>
      <li>makes doing nails so much easier!</li>
      <li>Came exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>When I received this item I first put water in it just wanted to test it out.</li>
      <li>Top doesnt screw on properly and it leaks</li>
      <li>I was super excited to see that it actually worked.</li>
      <li>Unbelievable price for a good product.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve purchased this dispenser I don&#x27;t use as much remover or cotton balls on my nails.</li>
      <li>very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>really?</li>
      <li>fast shipping and inexpensive.</li>
      <li>A lot bigger than originally thought</li>
      <li>It requires that u fill it almost half way before any liquid can pump to the dispensing area (top).</li>
      <li>After the 3rd time using acetone as my facial toner this definitely will allow me to tell the difference good pumping action!</li>
      <li>Work great for alcohol and other liquids needing to be dispensed in small amounts.</li>
      <li>Unlike other reviewers, I had no problems with these not dispensing the liquids (I bought one for alcohol and one for acetone), within a few pumps, I was good to go.</li>
      <li>Spend a little more and getting something spill proof that actually works.</li>
      <li>Arrived promptly from Hong Kong, no less!</li>
      <li>hard to get remover started but works fine after that</li>
      <li>Also you have to push down on the pump a couple times the first time you begin to use it, in order for remover to be let out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would expect polish remover to evaporate quickly from this since the lid is just there for show, and forget about being confident in this not tipping over when you use it, since the base is made of lightweight plastic.</li>
      <li>The silver top leaks, very cheap quality, very disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!</li>

<li> The pump is a little weak but ok for home use</li>
<li> The fact that the flip lid came with a plastic protective cover is laughable given the quality, and seeing how I almost ripped the flip lid off with the simple act of removing the protective cover, I assume the lid would probably fall off after light use (that is, if I even could use it given</li>
<li> One came damaged unable to use other one is ok</li>
<li> The metal top gets to look really dirty when you use up the remover</li>
<li> They work ok, just don&#x27;t knock it over, it leaks like crazy.  </li>
<li> Within a few moments (just enough time for me to shoo the cat out) over a third of the liquid had leaked out.</li>
<li> loose cover always</li>
<li> /&gt;It arrived about a week before the expected delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The shipping fee would of been more then the price of the dispenser. :(</li>
<li> You may also put water in them for grandkids water painting plus lots of other projects.</li>
<li> /&gt;It is not too small &amp; not too big.</li>
<li> The pump failed the first time using water.  </li>
<li> So be very careful.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s an average product for the price.</li>
<li> Not worth buying it.</li>
<li> Not worth returning.</li>
<li> But it isn&#x27;t a big deal, to me at least.</li>
<li> , it is not worth buying</li>
<li> Not worth the money or the wait.</li>
<li> , maybe half of half of it &amp; it lasts me a couple uses.</li>
<li> A little flimsy and not that well made.</li>
<li> little chance of spillage.  </li>
<li> It stopped working after a few months.</li>
<li> I expected a heavier container considering it is meant to hold nail polish remover which you wouldn&#x27;t want leaking onto furniture or other vulnerable</li>
<li> A little on the slow side</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m not sure that would work.</li>
<li> If you have pets, small children</li>
<li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND-You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
<li> and/or are extremely clumsy, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest you buying it.</li>
<li> Such a disappointment.</li>
<li> this pruduct is NOT GOOD</li>
<li> Common Sense people !</li>
<li> The cap won&#x27;t screw on because the threads are virtually non-existent, and the flip lid is misaligned and poorly attached to the cap.</li>
<li> Mostly broken when received.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Terrible quality! It leaks like crazy</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this broke on me..it worked at first and then all of a sudden it stopped working. The pump wasn&#x27;t suctioning the liquid. So i just threw it away. The shipping fee would of been more then the price of the dispenser. :(</li>
    <li> This is the easiest way to apply acetone to cotton for gel nail removal.  little chance of spillage.  I am happy with this purchase, and will most likely repurchase when needed.  UPDATE:  I had to warn others.  The seal on the bottle is weak and will leak badly of knocked over on its side.  So be very careful.  I almost ruined the finish on the table and the wooden floor beneath.</li>
    <li> The top doesn&#x27;t even close. It jingles loudly, and spills easily. It squirts liquid up instead of lightly filling the top.</li>
    <li> Good for cleaning flux off of connections.</li>
    <li> Mostly broken when received.</li>
    <li> also good in board repair.</li>
    <li> One came damaged unable to use other one is ok</li>
    <li> They work ok, just don&#x27;t knock it over, it leaks like crazy.  But then again, they never claimed it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Plastic seems flimsy. I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s an average product for the price.</li>
    <li> This was great at first, but the straw on the inside has a crack on it and after one use it no longer pumps nail polish remover anymore. I tried taping it, but that didn&#x27;t work. I might try replacing it with a drinking straw but I&#x27;m not sure that would work.</li>
    <li> I was a lil worried it would not work ... BUT IT WORKS PERFECT .. You just have to give it a couple pushes at first when you first fill it up so the nail polish gets through the tube ! Common Sense people !</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but it seems to be awesome because I see salons use them when I get my nails done which is pretty often. And they seems to work pretty awesome so I&#x27;m excited!</li>
    <li> hard to get remover started but works fine after that</li>
    <li> I was so happy when I finally received my nail polish remover dispense bottle. But to my surprise it doesn&#x27;t even work AT ALL! Such a disappointment.</li>
    <li> This bottle is not a Menda!  Cheap knock off.  The pump failed the first time using water.  Not worth returning.</li>
    <li> It requires that u fill it almost half way before any liquid can pump to the dispensing area (top).</li>
    <li> Used for nail polish remover, pump dispenses onto cotton ball as desired. I plan to purchase additional container for dispensing witch hazel. Quick delivery (received within 4 days to Ohio)</li>
    <li> makes doing nails so much easier!</li>
    <li> Work great for alcohol and other liquids needing to be dispensed in small amounts.</li>
    <li> The pump is a little weak but ok for home use</li>
    <li> this pruduct is NOT GOOD im the pic it looks zo kool but itz really ugly,  I was so dissapointed that I truw it away!! Not worth buying it.</li>
    <li> When I received this item I first put water in it just wanted to test it out. The water came out on the top I was super excited to see that it actually worked. (LOVE IT)!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the bottle, but be prepared to lose about a quarter of your acetone a week from evaporation.</li>
    <li> After the 3rd time using acetone as my facial toner this definitely will allow me to tell the difference good pumping action!</li>
    <li> loose cover always, it is not worth buying</li>
    <li> I love this but - I had to replace the tube after 2 uses. It was cracked on both ends &amp; would not allow the rubbing alcohol to flow up the tube. I simply cut a piece of landscape watering tubing &amp; put that in its place. Voila, perfect.</li>
    <li> SUPER cheaply made. I used it to put makeup remover in and it leaked. The top started rusting after a week. Tossed mine already</li>
    <li> cheaply made, leaks, plastic container.  I expected a heavier container considering it is meant to hold nail polish remover which you wouldn&#x27;t want leaking onto furniture or other vulnerable surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;It took forever to get delivered to.  Not worth the money or the wait.</li>
    <li> Cheap and yet does what it needs too!</li>
    <li> It works well, but the metal lid rusts.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work.  I told the company they said they couldn&#x27;t do anything until I send a picture of item. really?</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve purchased this dispenser I don&#x27;t use as much remover or cotton balls on my nails.</li>
    <li> Very handy tool to have around. I&#x27;ve discovered it can be used for more than just alcohol or polish remover. You may also put water in them for grandkids water painting plus lots of other projects. Let your imagination be your guide. The priceis also RIGHT ;-} I HIGHLY RECOMMEND-You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Came exactly as advertised. A little on the slow side but, I have them for the best price. Perfect for my wife&#x27;s alcohol, acetone and other medicinal and beauty related products.</li>
    <li> Item stopped working within 3 minutes.  Remover wouldn&#x27;t travel up the tubing anymore.  Container tipped to the side briefly and remover spilled out of it all over the place, ruining the table and everything around.  Do not purchase this item.  Spend a little more and getting something spill proof that actually works.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I fill it with gamsol and use it in my crafting.  I can access the gamsol with one hand and that is very handy.</li>
    <li> it does the job. preserves acetone well. It does leak if placed on its side. makes taking polish off easier</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife to dispense nail polish remover as a Christmas present. She loves it. I&#x27;m still waiting to see if it seals well enough to keep the liquid from evaporating. If it does a good job I&#x27;ll be buying one of these to dispense alcohol for cleaning circuit boards and assemblies.</li>
    <li> Love it for my acrylic liquid</li>
    <li> A little flimsy and not that well made. They do however work just fine. Hope they will last.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price but I still can&#x27;t recommend it. Unlike other reviewers, I had no problems with these not dispensing the liquids (I bought one for alcohol and one for acetone), within a few pumps, I was good to go. My biggest issue is with it leaking. My cat jumped up onto the counter where it was sitting and he knocked it over. Within a few moments (just enough time for me to shoo the cat out) over a third of the liquid had leaked out. If you have pets, small children and/or are extremely clumsy, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest you buying it.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly from Hong Kong, no less! Item was exactly as described, and was a very good buy, considering similar items cost three times the price at stores in the US.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Only works once in a while. I would NOT recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> broke within days, I order two, the second broke that day I transferred the liquid to it. I&#x27;m just not going to bother</li>
    <li> Unbelievable price for a good product.</li>
    <li> Top doesnt screw on properly and it leaks</li>
    <li> Thank you for your shipping soon actually this product I love helps me a lot to use that I&#x27;m giving it. I recommend this product is of very good quality.</li>
    <li> A lot bigger than originally thought</li>
    <li> The silver top leaks, very cheap quality, very disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give this zero stars if I could. The quality is absolutely terrible. The cap won&#x27;t screw on because the threads are virtually non-existent, and the flip lid is misaligned and poorly attached to the cap. I would expect polish remover to evaporate quickly from this since the lid is just there for show, and forget about being confident in this not tipping over when you use it, since the base is made of lightweight plastic. The fact that the flip lid came with a plastic protective cover is laughable given the quality, and seeing how I almost ripped the flip lid off with the simple act of removing the protective cover, I assume the lid would probably fall off after light use (that is, if I even could use it given the cap won&#x27;t screw on.) This was a terrible purchase, and of course returning a product shipped from China is never worth it, so I&#x27;m stuck with a useless item.</li>
    <li> had this product for some time now, does its job no complaints yet. very easy and convenient to use for any liquid.</li>
    <li> fast shipping and inexpensive. This can save you a lot of acetone or alcohol while cleaning nail polish around the nail beds.</li>
    <li> It stopped working after a few months.</li>
    <li> the top is very flimzy and have to play with it to get it to work</li>
    <li> This pump does the job very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived about a week before the expected delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not too small &amp; not too big. The remover does evaporate over time. But it isn&#x27;t a big deal, to me at least. I don&#x27;t fill the pump up all the way, maybe half of half of it &amp; it lasts me a couple uses. The metal top gets to look really dirty when you use up the remover but that can be easily cleaned. If tilted over it will all be spilled. Just don&#x27;t let it fall on it&#x27;s side &amp; it will be fine. Also you have to push down on the pump a couple times the first time you begin to use it, in order for remover to be let out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the price &amp; free shipping, this item was deffinetly a steal! I recommend to anyone who is obsessed with their nails &amp; want to make it easier on themselves. (Instead of unscrewing the remover bottle every time.)</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for over 28 years.  Pumps still working...just needed more of them.</li>
