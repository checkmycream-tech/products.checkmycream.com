    <li> My aesthetician uses Yonka products for my facials and this stuff rocks.  The herbaly scent is very relaxing, must be the juniper and rosemary.  The results are dramatic.

The price was modest, shipping terrific, communication outstanding!</li>

    <li> I put this on at night, after cleansing.  Honestly, it smells kind of spicy, and that&#x27;s about all I get from it.  I have not seen any improvement in my&lt;br /&gt;skin...It is more of an essential oil than a face serum.  My sinus kind of opened a bit, but as far as benefits to skin and face, I say find something else.  I&lt;br /&gt;think I was duped and my money:  wasted.  :(</li>
    <li> This serum is awesome! My skin looks so good and my face isn&#x27;t as oily even though this is a serum.</li>
