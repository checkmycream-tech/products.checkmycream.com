      <li>Best moisturizer for daily wear I have found.  </li>

      <li>I started using it again in the winter for lack of a better lotion while I wait for something else, and I will give it this</li>

      <li>Excelent moisturizer and the most important SPF-15 to prevent premature aging.</li>
      <li>Roc treatment products are great, and the Daily Moisturizer for deep wrinkles is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>This was a good price and it arrives in very resonable time.</li>
      <li>It has a strong chemical smell but other than that everything else about this product is great!</li>
      <li>I love Roc products because they have keep my skin looking fresh and radiant for more than 20 years.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is an update: Since I wrote this review a couple of years ago I&#x27;ve found the scent to be stronger quite strong depending on the tube.</li>
      <li>As I just began using this product, I can&#x27;t give an accurate account, as yet.</li>
      <li>They guessed (which was a great compliment) me as maybe 55, possible 60.  </li>
      <li>and I see how smooth it looks.</li>
      <li>I could not give it one star because I did not hate it.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is light but still noticeable.  </li>
      <li>Surprisingly, my acne completely cleared up within a matter of weeks after using the CeraVe, which is a non-comedogenic (sp?) product.  </li>
      <li>the pads did leave my face feeling smooth and clean.</li>
      <li>Very Fast &amp; Secure Shipping!</li>
      <li>I was so excited when I saw this product.</li>
      <li>Worth getting!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been familiar with this product for a while on and off.</li>
      <li>But I love this cream; I noticed a difference in my skin after the first week of nightly use.</li>
      <li>I use it everyday and it feels very good on my face.</li>
      <li>Use for few years, very good.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product from Amazon and it arrived in great condition, before the estimated arrival date and is all I expected it to be.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good anti-wrinkles, it will protect you from the sun (which is the most damageable for your skin) and will be a perfect base if you apply make up.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s actually quite a good value.</li>
      <li>On a whim, I bought a full bottle of it, and figured I&#x27;d try it once my ROC was all gone.  </li>
      <li>But a three maybe was good enough.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 40 and have good skin and look younger than  my age.</li>
      <li>Love the stuff and highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>This moisturizer is very rich and feels like it can and will do some good in the dry and windy area that I live in.</li>
      <li>Fast Ship!!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I feel that the Roc Products are great.  I use it before Roc and had stop because of the price. The product has what every woman[[ASIN:B00387F426 RoC Deep Wrinkle Daily Moisturizer SPF30, 1 Ounce]] of a certain age search for and needs.  I thank you for your products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theresa D</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell if product works, but I couldn&#x27;t ask for better service. Will use this site again if I like the product.</li>
    <li> I use it every summer and I&#x27;m 50 years old. It&#x27;s maybe one of the best cream to apply under a liquid foundation or a bb cream. Even when I don&#x27;t wear make-up, I apply it in the morning and don&#x27;t use sunscreen unless I go outside for many hours. It doesn&#x27;t give a firmness to your skin, it just prevent new wrinkles to form. I use another cream at night that is for firmness. Creams are just to avoid the worst, not to do miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would say is that a retinol creams, it includes Roc Retinol Correcxion Deep Wrinkle, aren&#x27;t made to use on an irritated skin. After a face scrub, a sunburn or if you have redness on your nose or cheeks, you might want to avoid using it. It doesn&#x27;t help. I recommend it for a day cream, that you wear make up or not. It&#x27;s a good anti-wrinkles, it will protect you from the sun (which is the most damageable for your skin) and will be a perfect base if you apply make up. Not recommended for reactive or very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using ROC for years, and it works miracles. I just turned 50 it takes 10yrs off your age.</li>
    <li> I used this product for close to a year.  I&#x27;m 42 and my dermatologist had prescribed a retinol agent for me, but said I&#x27;d need to find a day-time moisturizer with 30+ SPF as the retinol makes your skin even more prone to sun damage.  There aren&#x27;t many daily moisturizers with 30+ SPF.  I found this one at Costco, and knowing it was in the higher end grocery store category, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I was relatively pleased with the way it went on, but noticed that it did seem to take several minutes to soak in before my skin was ready to apply makeup to.  Unfortunately, I started breaking out - with deep, frequent acne.  My skin was a complete mess, and I was getting more and more acne scars.  Not being particularly in-tune with things like this, and never having had issues with sensitive skin before, I just assumed the acne was due to a recent medication change, and due to hormonal changes.  I&#x27;d read a number of articles that said acne in your 40s was very common - and I just assumed this was a problem I was going to have to contend with.  I went back to the dermatologist and told her what I happened.  She prescribed prescription acne medicine, but suggested that I might want to try switching my moisturizer.  She gave me a sample of CeraVe to take home.  Being a bit dense about these things, I still didn&#x27;t really give it much thought that it might be the ROC that was causing my acne issues.  So the CeraVe sample sat in my drawer for months before I decided to try it.  In the meantime, my face continued to break out.  Finally I tried the CeraVe.  I got a few applications out of the sample and thought it felt nice, but I still wasn&#x27;t thinking this might make a difference with my acne.  On a whim, I bought a full bottle of it, and figured I&#x27;d try it once my ROC was all gone.  It&#x27;s about half the price of ROC, and also contains 30 SPF.  Surprisingly, my acne completely cleared up within a matter of weeks after using the CeraVe, which is a non-comedogenic (sp?) product.  I still get a little acne (once a month), but it&#x27;s very minor and surface-level.  The deep acne is GONE.  So, since I&#x27;ve made no other changes to my diet or medications during this time, I can only conclude it was the ROC that was causing my skin to break-out.  I just wanted to caution you, if you use this product, to watch for an increase in break-outs.  If you get them, you might want to stop the ROC for a while to see if things improve.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> Anti-Wrinkle creams are a dime a dozen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their effectiveness relies on the formula and essential wrinkle fighting ingredients combined.  You will have to do your own research on which ingredient(s) works best for you or is the one that you are searching for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer smells great.  The fragrance is light but still noticeable.  It certainly ISN&#x27;T pungent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you have minor wrinkles this might work fine.  For deeper ones, this might simply just moisturize.</li>
    <li> ROC is the best anti-wrinkle cream I&#x27;ve ever used and I feel like I tried everything. I&#x27;m 29...and I noticed recently that I&#x27;m really starting to get the creases around my eyes and talked to my dermatologist about it. She suggested do \\&quot;preventative maintenance\\&quot; with ROC. I use it all over my face and especially under my eyes. It&#x27;s a dramatic, visible difference within a week if you religiously use it every day. Just make it part of your morning makeup routine.</li>
    <li> I gave this lotion to my mom and she loves it.  I took out one star becaue of the slow delivery.</li>
    <li> I am 32 years old and beginning to notice fine lines around my eyes and lips. In an effort to reverse this effect, and to combat future aging, I decided to purchase a retinol cream for my face. I have done the research and know retinols work very well, if applied regularly, but a lot of products claim they have retinol, but only have a small amount. I did my research and chose 3 products to try: Olay Total Effects Daily Moisturizer, Dr. Brandt Crease Release, and Roc Correxion Daily Moisturizer. I gave 4 weeks to all 3 products, and the Roc Correxion is BY FAR the best cream. My lines around my eyes and lips are GONE and my skin is very smooth and moisturized. I use my moisturizer daily, and my lines are gone, and my skin is younger looking than ever. I highly recommend this product. The price cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  This stuff does not work.  I bought it based on other reviews.  I&#x27;m telling you not to spend your money!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product from Amazon and it arrived in great condition, before the estimated arrival date and is all I expected it to be. I love this moisturizer and will order from this vendor again. Thankyou.</li>
    <li> It DOES NOT contain Retinol or Retina A if you actually read the ingredients...It actually contains their own formula that they call \\&quot;RETINOL CORREXION®\\&quot; which contains other chemicals and a sunscreen....it&#x27;s basically a scam.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several  years--I have tried other products which have been good as well-but it seems I always return to Roc.  Used in conjunction with the Roc Resurfacing Disks, and the night cream--consistently-should yield you noticeable results.  I recommend all of their products.</li>
    <li> I simply love this wrinkle reducer by Roc. I saw great results in about 7 days. My skin is softer, and the wrinkles around my eyes and mouth are so much less visible. I wouldn&#x27;t be without this product. I would recommend this to anyone needing a little or a lot of help with facial lines and creases. You will be happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday and it feels very good on my face. I even use it on my hands.</li>
    <li> Excelent moisturizer and the most important SPF-15 to prevent premature aging. I love all Roc products and this is not the exception. I recommend it to all women and men, why not?  :-)</li>
    <li> I really think this stuff works. Been using it for about a month. My lines seem to be less noticable</li>
    <li> My skin feels soft, i have aVfew days using it and my face looks bettetbetter</li>
    <li> This is the best. I am a fanatic about my skin. I am also a fan of La Mer and gladly spend the $130 per jar, but I think of that as a true moisturizer and not really corrective. With this ROC deep wrinkle daily moisturizer you get visible results with religious use. (Of course, the idea that you can fix a deep wrinkle is stupid, so if you are 28 - 35 and thinking you need to take charge of your skin, buy this now. You need to start preventing the worst wrinkles with this, and not try to solve it later.) The tube is small, but you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to get good coverage. I think it&#x27;s actually quite a good value. I use it on my face, hands, neck and chest - where damage occurs - and for the rest of my body, I use Lubriderm which is cheap and effective. I just wish Amazon could keep this in stock. My local drugstore is also often out of stock. This stuff must have a cult-like following.</li>
    <li> So far, love this product. Liked that a sticker was on the outside of the box w/an expiration date on it. Anything with an SPF should have one, as that ingredient can become inactive.</li>
    <li> I love Roc products because they have keep my skin looking fresh and radiant for more than 20 years.  Love, love, love!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is nice, a little heavier than I thought but must be why it works so well.  I will keep it stocked in gotta have drawer..</li>
    <li> Have been pleased with this product, this was my second round with it. Ty</li>
    <li> I have only used this for a couple of weeks, but I really like it.   I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference, but I think I need to use it for a while longer to see any changes.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found!</li>
    <li> It dried my skin instead of moisturizing it.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer for daily wear I have found.  Product arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> I put this on as directed.  It stung a lot around my eyes, but I didn&#x27;t wash it off because it said \\&quot;you may experience some irritation at first\\&quot;.  Same thing next night, and I decided I&#x27;d had enough &amp; quit using it. But then over the course of about the next week, new wrinkles appeared under both eyes, really big prominent ones under one of the eyes.  It seriously aged my facial appearance 10 years in a week!  I have actually now made an appointment with a plastic surgeon to see if it&#x27;s possible to reverse the damage.    I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t a typical experience or they&#x27;d be out of business, but I am outraged. If I&#x27;d taken close-up \\&quot;before\\&quot; pictures, they might be hearing from my lawyer.</li>
    <li> This product has a VERY heavy fragrance. I returned it.</li>
    <li> Cream arrived when promised and packaged so amazingly well!</li>
    <li> Use it in the morning after cleaning my face.  I use strictly RoC products and love the results.  Highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I have severe acne scars and intermittent rosacea. After using this product for a month my face looks younger and skin more radiant. The visible effects are 1) equal to latter treatments in series of fraxel laser (by dermatologist), 2) better than glycol peels (medi-spa). The benefits are 1) significantly less expense, 2) zero down time, 3) good sunscreen coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just started ROC night cream equivalent and hope it does even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product stings slightly but having had prescription-strength retinoid products my skin is pretty tough. Others might experience discomfort.</li>
    <li> This product is the only one that doesn&#x27;t make me look like Casper the friendly ghost. It is not greasy, not heavy feeling like makeup and not oily. I will do an update if I get any breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- No breakouts so far. I forgot to mention one thing--the smell of the sunscreen is strong and not pleasant. It has a strong chemical smell but other than that everything else about this product is great! (hence the 4 stars)</li>
    <li> Use for few years, very good.</li>
    <li> The night cream is very soothing and soaks right in!&lt;br /&gt;Works much better than kinerase!&lt;br /&gt;Not much of a scent..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an update: Since I wrote this review a couple of years ago I&#x27;ve found the scent to be stronger quite strong depending on the tube. Perhaps it depends where you buy it but I&#x27;ve bought it here and at a drugstore. I wish it these day and night creams were unscented as they are effective but I don&#x27;t use them much anymore as I often have a reaction to scents. (Roc did  replace one that was really intense upon opening)</li>
    <li> I tried this to use in conjunction with my other ROC products and to follow the ROC serum.  I feel that it provides only a very mild moisture that is not enough for very dry skin but then I live in a dry desert area.  I need to follow it up with Argan oil to achieve the moisturization that I need prior to applying foundation.  Wish that I could give a higher review as I love all my other ROC products.</li>
    <li> I like the product but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to decide if I will continue to do use it. I have to use it for another 2 months to decide if I will continue.</li>
    <li> I should of been using this time a long time ago.  At 62 and have spent a good amount outdoors in California, my skin is in fairly bad shape with lots of wrinkles.  I started using this cream and the night cream 2 weeks ago and it has actually taken away the deeper wrinkles and smooth out my smile lines.  Hope it will do eve more as time go by.  I&#x27;m now a believer in Retinol.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually one tho writes reviews, but I have been really impressed with this product. I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is smoother, firmer, and fine wrinkles less visible. I haven&#x27;t noticed this with other skin care products. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month. I&#x27;m in my early 70&#x27;s.A</li>
    <li> I have been using ROC products for years and have always been very satisfied.</li>
    <li> The day cream does not contain retinol as far as I can tell. Check the active ingredients listed on the back of the tube. Anyone else feel misled about this??</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I saw this product. I had been searching for a moisturizer with a high spf sunscreen. I used as directed and tried to apply make-up 10 minutes later. My foundation would not cover over it. It was impossible to apply my make-up smoothly and evenly. I did the best I could, but once I applied my setting powder, it looked horrible and splotchy. I had to wash my face and start over with no moisturizer. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> the small size goes a long long ways so you get your moneys worth. its easy to use and feels good on the face. because of money, I only bought it once but would buy it agian and again if I could. I am 72-severly wrinkled so didnt see any difference to my skin but need to use longer--Ireally liked it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been familiar with this product for a while on and off. It&#x27;s excellent and you see results very soon as one week after star its use. I use it after I clean my face and let it set and dry before I applied make-up and I see how smooth it looks. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> For the the price Rocs anit-aging corrextion line is awesome.  Definantly less visible lines. You won&#x27;t be disappointed ! Get it !</li>
    <li> I used this product as instructed, religiously.  I really hoped, based on reviews on this site, it would work.    Actually, in the beginning, I believed it was working.  I found out, I, as probably many others, were deceiving themselves in one of 4 ways to justify their purchase:      1.)  Different lighting does really produce different looking results, whether it be the angle of light or the quality (i.e. yellow or white light).  2.)  The product did nothing more than a good rich moisturizer, period.    3.)  Their makeup is actually doing the trick.  4.)  At night, you relatively expressionless face allows for a lot of fluid buildup and minor repairs in the \\&quot;cracks\\&quot; that give you a \\&quot;better\\&quot; look in terms of fine lines/wrinkles.  But this wears off really soon after waking up.      Judge yourself right before bed, without makeup, and any additional moisturizer, with different angles and quality fo light to see if this really works.  I found out, that, it doesn&#x27;t.  Best of all take pictures, under the same ocnditions, and check 1, 2, and 3 months later to see if there&#x27;s a difference and let a 3rd party judge them, not you.     When examined objectively, this product does nothing.  While retinol has been shown in pharmaceutical grade quantities to improve fine lines/wrinkles, I doubt this product has the same concentration (and they don&#x27;t list the concentration either, so good luck finding out what it is).    Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> No problem. I would purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because of all the positive reviews.  When I recieved it,I was very disappointed to find it is not fragrance free.  After I applied it, I became congested and then it triggered a migraine.  I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> since discovering roc products i have been pleasantly surprised. my skin is very sensitive and has the sun kissed aging look but has been greatly improved since using roc.</li>
    <li> Always a good product. Works well on wrinkles if your expression are not too deep. I have been using this product for a few years now.</li>
    <li> Cons - I bought this a few months ago in the Summer and I don&#x27;t feel for my skin type it works well. I live in the mountain west where it is not humid. I&#x27;m 40 and have good skin and look younger than  my age. I don&#x27;t have extra oily or dry skin. But given our weather,  I wanted something that hydrates and sinks in. When I used it the first time, it just feels and looks extra greasy. It didn&#x27;t allow me to put my mineral makeup on over it b/c it obviously clumped to the wetter areas even after 10 minutes .It actually looked as if I was living in a hot high humidity area based of the initial \\&quot;shine\\&quot; effect. If I did go with it, my face, if I touch it in the next couple of hours,  just peels off in lotion/skin in little rolls - almost like I am wearing makeup too heavy.   Pros - I started using it again in the winter for lack of a better lotion while I wait for something else, and I will give it this - it sunk it pretty much immediatly and didn&#x27;t roll off as much - its thicker texture is nice for where I live providing I apply it for a day at home or before I go to bed. I guess I like it alright - but I would not go out of my way to buy it.  I&#x27;ve seen it at Sams Club a lot which makes me wonder if they oversell or if other people have the same experience I do.  I would not go out of my way to buy it again given its performance. Its almost like a night cream .... unless you have 20 minutes to waste in the morning - your makeup will not apply correctly as the base is still trying to figure out if it should sink in our roll off.</li>
    <li> This product is just ordinary discount sunblock in a fancy tube, so don&#x27;t waste your money. If anyone has a recommendation for a real wrinkle moisturizer please let me know.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is very rich and feels like it can and will do some good in the dry and windy area that I live in. (Wyoming) Winter and diabetes can do serious damage to one&#x27;s complexion. As I just began using this product, I can&#x27;t give an accurate account, as yet.</li>
    <li> Amazing, amazing, amazing.  Love these products</li>
    <li> Did not work. Yet will give it more time have  A lot of wrinkle s am A male so if get something for older male let me know As&lt;br /&gt;Rgkdneff@gmail.com</li>
    <li> Great cream.  It&#x27;s a little expensive to use everyday, so I have gone back to the daily moisturizer I used before.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, but I&#x27;m still trying to find the best</li>
    <li> First time I have tried this one, and it works well as a moisturizer.  However, after application, it stays sort of &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; on the face.  I think that I will save this for cooler weather usage, as it is just too heavy for hot weather.  I do love ROC products!</li>
    <li> I ordered this with several other RoC Retin A containing products and I am so glad that I did!  I saw a difference within the first week!  My friends and family noticed a difference also and it is great because it contains SPF 30, so I don&#x27;t have to use another SPF lotion on top of it.  If you use any kind of Retin A products, you HAVE TO use a sunscreen!  This product does it all....sloughs away skin to reveal a smoother skin that diminishes wrinkles, and protects that new skin from the sun.  Worth getting!</li>
    <li> But be careful using it around your eyes, it stings and makes your eyes hurt all day. So I have been using it below my eyes.</li>
    <li> Been using for years. I am now retired , 70, &amp; still use, also use two more Roc&lt;br /&gt;products &amp; like.</li>
    <li> Mi skin never looked so good</li>
    <li> I used it a couple of times...it was delivered on time and was reasonably priced...I dont&#x27; use it more than once a week because it has a perfume smell that affects my asthma and it burns.</li>
    <li> I started noticing my skin aging at around 25. It had a gray pallor and lacked firmness. I bought ROC purely for prevention as part of a daily regimen. I was Shocked when I woke up 4 weeks later and Bam, my skin looked as fresh, plump and bright as it did when I was 18.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just turned 30 and after trying several other cheaper brands, had to go back to Roc. The others can&#x27;t compare. B/c of its thickness it goes a lot longer than cheaper, thinner moisturizers and that alone makes it worth it. I don&#x27;t know about erasing lines, but I can say for your daily and nightly regimen this can&#x27;t be beat for the price. I&#x27;m definitely going to look into their other products, now that fine lines are starting to get more prominent.</li>
    <li> I have used ROC Retinol for about 3 yrs now.  I use it after cleansing in the am and I also use it in the evening.  No one believes I am the age I am.  I just had a BIG birthday and the people in my church were aghast when I said I am now 70.  They guessed (which was a great compliment) me as maybe 55, possible 60.  I will always use this.</li>
    <li> I will continue to buy this product.  I&#x27;ve tried many others but can honestly say it&#x27;s probably the best.  There&#x27;s definitely a noticeable difference in my complexion.</li>
    <li> Roc treatment products are great, and the Daily Moisturizer for deep wrinkles is wonderful.  I use it faithfully--and I have no deep wrinkles.  It works well with the Nightly Moisturizer for Deep Wrinkles, helping to keep those furrows at bay.  Love the stuff and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this product. It does wonders for my face! Gives me a glow I haven&#x27;t seen in years! I am 59 and really recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Works really well. Don&#x27;t rub it in too fast though.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work any better than the other more reasonable products out there with the same results, very little difference in moisturizing for the face.  I would not waste my money.</li>
    <li> ROC products feel good and do improve the look of the skin.  I am always getting comments on that my skin is looking better.</li>
    <li> I needed a deep moisturizer for the wonderful wrinkles I am acquiring, now that I am in my forties. This is a heavier moisturizer, so I do use it sparingly on my most problem areas. I haven&#x27;t really used it long enough to tell if it actually works, as far as correcting my wrinkles. It does deep moisturize, though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Roc products daily and I&#x27;m a firm believer that it reduces wrinkles. But, you have to use it daily as with all wrinkle creams. I also like the spf 30 ~ for daytime use.</li>
    <li> tube broke before when it was almost empty.  the product resulting in the licquid separating.</li>
    <li> I like the roc pruducts and being able to find them at a lower price on Amazon saves a lot of money for me. This was a good price and it arrives in very resonable time. I would recomend the product and  this service to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! It feels great does great on my skin and I love the fact that it has 30 SPF ! I have been using this for about a year and will keep using!</li>
    <li> Received on time and ok. I recommend (for friends).</li>
    <li> I could not give it one star because I did not hate it.  But a three maybe was good enough.  Roc retinol correxion deep wrinkle daily moisturizer was not a noticeable difference in my wrinkles.  I also combine with the Roc cleansing pads.  Now it is said your skin turns over new surface cell every 30 days.  Using both of these products I found no change in my skin.  What is great that the retinol did not irritate my skin and the pads did leave my face feeling smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Very Fast &amp; Secure Shipping! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Have used for years and like it</li>
    <li> Great cream for 30 something’s who want to get a kick-start on rejuvenating their skin. I wear the cream at night only, because it doesn&#x27;t mix well with my foundation in the day. But I love this cream; I noticed a difference in my skin after the first week of nightly use. I have sensitive skin and it never irritated my skin. My skin seems bright and more resilient from using this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It does everything it claims! I use the eye cream which is amazing, as well as the serum. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> As Pictures!!  As Described!!  Fast Ship!!  I have been using the&lt;br /&gt;RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream for about a year now and really love the Daily cream due to the SPF added.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this.  It doesn&#x27;t make your skin break out but it really didn&#x27;t work for wrinkles.  Spend your money on something better.</li>
    <li> Love the feel of this cream on my face</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT &amp; SUPPER AMAZON SELLER A+++++</li>
    <li> The same thing happened to me that happened to This aged me ten years. I had some stinging but that went away and then I noticed the wrinkles and flaky skin under my eyes. My eyes even where swelling up in the morning. It took a few days for that to stop. My side affects took about two weeks.</li>
