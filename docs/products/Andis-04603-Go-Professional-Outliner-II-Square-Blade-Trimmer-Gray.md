<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I finally found the perfect clipper but had to open it and to fix it myself, because did defeaning noise. Of course the seller has not replied to my EMAIL sent him.</li>
    <li> Worked for about 6 months before it stopped - just a humming motor... I thought it was just this one, so I bought another one... it did the same thing after using once.  I ended up having to send back in for a refund.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> it does not come on sometime..it drives me crazy</li>
    <li> i have been using these for years to shave with and trim my mustache and beard, they are great. They want give a close shave like a razor but they prevent razor bumps and are fine for a quick shave, you also have the ability to use different blades I use the T-liner</li>
    <li> Very good product, meets expectations. Was recommended by a friend, husband is very happy</li>
    <li> I had to adjust these clippers three times till I finally got it right. This left me with cuts around my hairline lol. However now that it is adjusted correctly I love them. It saves me time at the barber but more importantly money since I do it myself!! However in my opinion I&#x27;m more comfortable with the T-Outliner and I purchased that one as well but everyone is different . Good buy, reasonable price</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older Oster trimmer. THis trimmer was a good choice. It trims cleanly and, even better, it is quiet. Recommended highly.</li>
    <li> Niiiiice cant beat the price either!!  Saved 40 bucks!!</li>
    <li> Pros    -The thing is made sharp!  -Has a comfortable feel (ergonomic switch is really ergo)  -has nice weight/feels sturdy    Cons  -Things get&#x27;s BLAZING HOT!! (after 40 minutes of use)  -Vibrates a lot, you will feel a ringing in your hands afterwards    overall just easy to use and I would recommend it as the cheap way out.  If you have $$ get something cooler and with less vibration.</li>
    <li> As advertised and great delivery time as usually .</li>
    <li> When I first receive my clipper I notice that they didn&#x27;t cut my hair as close I the andis I bought three year ago.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to take my andis clipper to be sharping at the place I bought my first Andis Outliner II.  My clipper was examine and I was told the Blade was defected from the factory.  They put a new blade on and now the clipper cut the way I expected them to cut when I first bought them.  Make sure you don&#x27;t make the same mistake it cost me $27.00.</li>
    <li> Use them every day to shave</li>
    <li> This was a christmas gift for my son. I didn&#x27;t know if this was a good brand or not.  But, when my son opened his gift, he was so impressed that i got a really good set of trimmer.  I&#x27;m not familiar with brands of trimmers, but, my son told me that these trimmer are fabulous.  They are really sharp, so be quick and careful when trimming around your ears and/or neck. These trimmer do a professional job.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Really good trimmer to shave or line up your hair,mustache or beard. Great product for a very affordable price, i</li>
    <li> Way better than my normal trimmers. Although they did  heat up pretty quickly, the overall performance were okay. They cut really neat and clean.</li>
    <li> These are the real deal. With the 4 attachments for the Outliner II you&#x27;re beard is set. If you want longer or something you need to get these full size metal/plat/chrome looking ones that are about $100 on sale. I&#x27;m Middle Eastern and have thick dense hair and it works ok w me, My beard is huge in a few days... so... and my homie who&#x27;s a barber is a brother that hooks up fades and facial hair to all the dudes around the hood. Like up to 10 a day. I have the outlinerII and he has that, the &#x27;outliner T&#x27; which is cool for the face more accurate but cant/wont take any attachments, and da big $100 chrome ones, that has a gang of attachments.  You gotta oil em every coupla days to once a week and you can take off the blade and push it up a tiny bit for a closer shave and can brush the inside. Also fill a cap of rubbing alcohol and put the corner/edge of the clippers in the cap of alcohol and turn it on. That&#x27;ll clean it up nice, after that make sure u oil it. Durable! But i dunno abt their $10 dollar ones. Yea man the prices on Amazon are the same price as the wholesaler we buy them from. Where fades and fancy facial hair are bein hooked up, their using Andis&#x27;. And Andis got em for the wholesaler price!</li>
    <li> Best invention ever for dads!!!!</li>
    <li> Check out Denzel Washington using these bad boys in Equalizer,they work for him and they work for me!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not met my inspectations cuz it doesn&#x27;t do the job good</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good machine would of been perfect if it was a bit sharper. Its sketchy at first also buying from the internet and not knowing iff its going to turn out good but was surprsingly surprised on how good it was.</li>
    <li> works good. powerful. loud. not as comfortable for dry shaving as i had hoped but generally made up for in general apparent quality.  puts to shame all the walmart crap sold with a million functions none of which are done well.</li>
    <li> precise cutting, pro grade.  I would get it again.</li>
    <li> love it, well made product</li>
    <li> Opened it and fully satisfied as I had turned it on. Great clean sound to it and happy with my purchase. . .</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, provides a close trim, especially compared to other, however it does get real hot after about 5 minutes of use.  You have to hold it a certain way so you do not get burned.</li>
    <li> Perfect. The best of the best. Amazon is the best place to get your stuff at a cheaper price and delivered to you in no time. I love it a lot.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to learn that these are the same clippers that are used by the salon where I get my haircut. They worked very well for trimming overgrown body hair. They have it all over the Wahl brand clippers I had. They are much. much better in fact.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace an old Andis shaver I had for 7yrs and as expected it worked just fine as my old one; brand loyalty. I highly recomend this ultra quiet product to others in the market for a dry shaver.</li>
    <li> great clippers been using them for years</li>
    <li> Not cheap but great professional quality</li>
    <li> The Andis Professional 04603 Outliner II Personal Trimmer is not too sharp and not too gentle. It is great for all areas with hair that you want to perform trimming. The size of the Andis Professional 04603 Outliner II Personal Trimmer is great for facial hair, and it gives enough room for eyesight when lining the hair on your own forehead. If you want a guaranteed shape up without having to experiment with 50 other trimmers this product is what your looking for. The Andis Professional 04603 Outliner II Personal Trimmer is one of its kind and I know for a fact that as long as it&#x27;s being made buyers will buy. A good price with a strong structure plus the benefits of no batteries which saves a lot of money. However, even though it feels and looks strong enough to take on a world of destruction you still need to take care of it then the Andis Professional 04603 Outliner II Personal Trimmer will last a lifetime. I used mine within the first 10 minutes of receiving it through the mail. Thanks</li>
    <li> Works good. It is the perfect machine to permit save a lot of money each month. You can try too.</li>
    <li> The Andis Professional is an excellent built trimmer. I use it for dry shaving due to my skin. It has a sharp enough blade for shaving.  I also use it for spring up my mustache and goatee.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve went through a lot of trimmers, and none of them worked like the outliner 2&#x27;s. I usually get my hair lined up in the barber shop and noticed what kind of trimmers they used and thats when I came across these. Everytime I line myself up, people ask me what Barber I go to. Ive used T-Outliners, there alright, but definitely not better than the outliner 2&#x27;s. Ive seen these in the Beauty Stores for 70 and up and there only 40 something on here. Great Deal. Defintely Worth The Money. These trimmers are a must have if you&#x27;re trying to stay on your AAAaaa game.</li>
    <li> a friend of mine recommended me this product,i was skeptic at first but once i&#x60;ve tried it well i was amazed.This is one of the best outliner/trimmer on the market.Andis did a really good job with this one.You should try it</li>
    <li> I paid more than $10 above the price now but I&#x27;m not complaining. It works like the clippers my barber used and I haven&#x27;t had to use a razor for about a month now. Dry shave is better, imo ... a lot, at least for my skin.</li>
    <li> My second time buying., great product once adjusted!</li>
    <li> Bought this item in March 2010 to trim my hairline after cutting my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used this item six times a year for a total of 12 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In June 2012, I turned it on and there is only a hum. The trimmer does not function. Completely dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer gave me a warning a few months back. When I turned it on there was only a hum. But after turning it on several times it worked again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time though, it is COMPLETELY DEAD. So it costs $50.00 for 12 uses, i.e. $4.16 per haircut.</li>
    <li> Brand new in the box. Works flawlessly. Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Clippers work just as i had wished, great for touch-ups and linings. can use for shaving as well, with minimal to no irritation. can heat up if on for too long, but that is avoidable, all and all is a great buy that does exactly what it is needed for</li>
    <li> This is my second time to buy this product.I have been using Andis for over 10 years with minimal problems  and its broke, it&#x27;s more than worth it.</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning up and linings....esp when you can&#x27;t make it to the barbershop.</li>
    <li> Great clippers I love them</li>
    <li> I use this clipper to cut my hair since I purchased it a few months ago.  It chews through my relatively thick hair in no time, and appears to be very well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism is that when I&#x27;m finished, a little hair can caught in the internal compartment (underneath the blade) which I think is normal for these types of hair clippers.  No problem so far, but to remove the blade covers, you have to unscrew a couple machine screws - in doing so I stripped one, and had to take a trip to the hardware store to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it were a little easier to clean the internal compartment every so often I would have given this 5 stars.  Don&#x27;t let that keep you from buying this though, its great.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> PERFECT.  Received from vendor in great condition and works great!  Very good quality.  I thought I needed a new one since my old one runs hot but I probably just should have changed the blade.  I would buy this again if necessary.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It is powerful, cuts fast and is not too loud. I shave my face and head about twice a a week and this is by far the best trimmer I have ever bought.</li>
    <li> does not give as close of shave as my peannut trimmer (inferior quality). I feel like i have to go over the same area twice to get good clean trim.&lt;br /&gt;Pro: quality is the best and looks like it will last forever.</li>
    <li> I bought this to trim my beard, and the available attachments for that are pretty lame. On the other hand it is well built and is not battery operated.</li>
    <li> This product is high quality.  I only have a couple of comments that may be noticed by non-pro customers:  1. It has a lot of vibration.  2. The edges of the blades are kind of pointy so it may scratch your skin (not enough to cut your skin), nothing pretty serious.  Besides the two comments, it is a pretty good product.  I have used it 3 times, and have no problems at all.</li>
    <li> I have owned  andis clippers for over (35) years they are known  to last as long as you take care of them. This is my 4th set and they all still work A1.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned and I&#x27;ve tried more than 10 in my lifetime. Only issue is that the cord is a little annoying and keeps twisting/tangling on itself.</li>
    <li> Husband needed a clipper for his beard. The Andis Professional Outliner II Personal Trimer is great for him! Also offered the oil &amp; clipper attachments. Great deal on price!</li>
    <li> Not a shape and close cutting as I thought. But still a great edger</li>
    <li> These clippers arent too bad except i had two problems with them. One was that the plug on the actual clipper didnt fit into the wall socket. One of the little prongs was too big. It looked like it needed to be filed down a little bit. Second was that you need to run the clippers in the same spot over and over and over again until the hair is finally gone. Unlike other clippers ive used in the past that you only run once or twice,these take more attempts in the same spot to get the hair off. Maybe its just me not using them right but those were the only two problems i had. Theyre kind of loud too but thats not a big deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this trimmer for a month but it has been great to use so far. I&#x27;m an amateur barber who hasn&#x27;t been cutting hair for a long time but this trimmer does everything that I expected it to. Using it is a lot better than using my clippers to do linings, which is what I had been doing before I made this purchase. It is a great tool for making lines and curves when cutting hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent. I would  recommend every men with beard to own one.</li>
    <li> Not bad shaved, cut pretty good for a dry shave... Good for line ups I don&#x27;t really use it for whole facial shave, I use a razor for that...</li>
    <li> great  edger, but not a good trimmer. This cuts really close for edging out my fades, but the teeth are too fine for finishing a scissor cut or even a #4 or longer buzz. I still use my wahl bullet for all my heavy edging and trimmer over comb work. This is really only good a cutting short hair shorter, and that it does very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had/used for a few weeks now.  Works as promised.  No complaints.  I use it to trim my beard as well as outline.  I keep my beard pretty short.  Not sure how well it would work on a long beard.  As advertised, its more of an outliner.  I did ask Andis if they had a shorter comb than the one (1/16&amp;#34;) that comes with the four combs I bought separately and was told &amp;#34;no&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> You cannot go wrong with this product. It is the gold standard for liners. Ok... platinum standard. I have owned other pairs over the years and nothing compares. Every man that grows hair on his face or head should own a pair. PERIOD</li>
    <li> Provides the close shave I need.</li>
    <li> Excellent I use this to trim and clean up .....works great. A must have in my opinion for a nice haircut. Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works good. Keep it oiled and dont forget to replace the blades. Mine went dull after 2 yrs of weekly use. Yea, i forgot thatbi had this for two yrs and that it still runs great. My only issue is that it can get hot pretty quick!</li>
    <li> The work great but they do get hot and they might burn you skin alittle bit. They work really good when you cut quick.</li>
    <li> I had already owned one of these and for some reason I gave them away. So I had to have them again. Great trimmer for everything. You won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I love my outliner II.  It provides a close shave and is great for shaping up my beard or hair line.  It&#x27;s easy to use, maintain, &amp; clean.  The only negative is that the motor causes it to get hot fairly quick.  Overall, I am pleased and look forward to using the Outliner II for many years to come.</li>
    <li> Could not get matching attachments to trim beard and surprisingly the trimmer does not come with attachments.</li>
    <li> This is horrible. Supposedly new. I plug it it it starts then it shuts itself off. I try using another plug and nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I needed this for work Tomorrow now I have nothing because of your defective products. Thanks.</li>
    <li> this is the best out liner outhere, i didn&#x27;t buy from amazon, i got for 70 dollars, but amazon has it for 50 wow. i big save. i bought it like two years ago and still works like new, and to tell the true i cut my own hair every weekend and never gave me problems. i love it</li>
    <li> They suck! They don&#x27;t cut close our sharp. I personally wouldn&#x27;t recommend these although Andies does have nice products. I should have got the GTO&#x27;S</li>
    <li> Edger is as seen however, it is not a T-outliner.  Very disappointed with the picture/description not matching what I bought.  I didn&#x27;t return it though because the T-outliner is only about $20.00 so its all good.  Blade that comes with it is not very sharp either.  Some adjustments will have to be made (if you know how to do it).</li>
    <li> hubby loved this trimmer but there are no combs for trim adjustment!  The only choice (additional) does not match the trimmer number, but I will order it anyway, as it might!</li>
    <li> it is exactly what it should be. it has great power and easy to handle. i just wish the head was wider</li>
    <li> Solid perfect and trims pretty low. I sharpened it myself for an even lower cut but I would advise you to not file it too low. Or it will bite you. Awsome clippers! Shipped real real fast!</li>
    <li> As many others have said you have to realign the blades(not that hard) to get this trimmer to cut closer.  After I did that I was very impressed with the cut it gave, very very close to shaving with a straight razor.  Be sure to get the oil too.</li>
    <li> Andis is a dependable and reliable products used by many barbers. Why go to the shop when you can do it yourself.</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly with the super close cut this trimmer gives. Perfect for super PRECISE shaping of facial hair!!! Definitely a quality crafted trimmer.</li>
    <li> I use this trimmer for a dry shave when I dont want to shave and the job is awesome. the machine is usa made and very solid and well made.</li>
    <li> I must have gone through 3 decently priced rechargeable beard trimmers in the past 10 years, due to poor quality, or charging problems, or dead motors. Wishing I got the Andis Trimmer a while ago! Been using this Andis Trimmer for more than a year and I love it. Powerful and study, this is a keeper!  fyi, you have to buy the attachement set seperatly, but all still completely worth it.</li>
    <li> This just what I want it cuts closer to my head then my t outliner I had for 12 yrs. I&#x27;m glad I came across this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a gift for my son-in-law. He was delighted with the gift. he has used this product before, and really likes how it handles. His beard is neat and stubble free now that he has the Pro Outliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product for guys who like to grow beards, and trim their own.</li>
    <li> I use these liner&#x27;s instead of a traditional razor every morning and I have been doing so for  about 3 years now. No hair bumps! Love it! And I can give myself a touch up in between barber visits!</li>
    <li> perfect for shape ups</li>
    <li> Shaves right down to the skin, and does a fantastic job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the following clips and they work GREAT on this trimmer (They are on prime as well! )&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CP4UAC/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> it is good, but it becomes hot, burning my hand and my head. why it is that to Andis? need answer?</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these clippers,</li>
    <li> These are great trimmers. They give you that fresh out the chair feeling, at no in the chair cost. I&#x27;m extremely happy that I purchased these trimmers.</li>
    <li> I use this trimmer for my beard ONLY and it&#x27;s been working good since an year now. Knock on wood :) hope it lasts for long time.</li>
    <li> Great. Just as expected. Received very quick</li>
    <li> Great trimmer. I&#x27;ve bought one before &amp; had absolutely no problems, so I decided to buy it again as a present. It&#x27;s great and comes with blade oil.</li>
    <li> i give it a four star review mainly kuz the blades aren&#x27;t so sharp and i was looking for super sharp Outliner.I adjust them but still not sharp enough for the extra close line up i had to buy the T-outliner replacement blades for this machine and now i&#x27;m happy with this product other then that this outliner works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used an Andis Master Clipper for beard trimming for a few years.  The Master Clipper is bigger than this trimmer, but rather heavy.  I decided to try this trimmer out to see if it was a bit less tiring.  It is definitely more manageable.  However, the teeth are rather smaller than the Master Clipper, so with curly beard hair it takes several passes to get everything clipped where the Master Clipper generally gets everything on the first pass.  The combs for this clipper are much better for beard trimming than the Master Clipper combs though.  If I had to recommend one or the other for beard trimming I think I&#x27;d go with this clipper.</li>
    <li> Got the T-Outliner Trimmers the first time (1998 - 2002)...they were okay, but nothing special.  Then I got the Outliner II Trimmers after that and have been good ever since.  I replaced with the same model in 2013.  Works so well.  My lines haven&#x27;t looked this good in ages.</li>
    <li> this little trimmer cuts extremely well and does not pull hair like those cheap battery operated ones.  this is on the pricey side, but it is very well made and feels like it will last for a long long time.  there is quite a bit of vibration though, and it is on the heavier side, but it does what it says and makes clean lines!</li>
    <li> Classic outliner, it definitely gets the job done, my only problem is that they get hot very fast. with that being said if you are into doing designs in your haircuts, then get 2 pair or wahl detailers or tatto clippers</li>
    <li> Awesome clippers/trimmers! Great price &amp; quick shipping.</li>
    <li> thanks for the machine, the outliner is in perfectly condition, thanks for all, enjoy a lot and have a good day. God bless you.</li>
    <li> I will admit, I have purchased several inexpensive devices (Wahl) for trimming my goatee/moustache, and all of them are long gone...found to be absolutely worthless! However, when my barber recommended that I purchase the Outliner II, I didn&#x27;t think twice. Because, after all, they are the exact clippers he would use when I would sit in his chair. These clippers work great for trimming, and they are built tough. I would recommend them to anyone looking to keep their goatee/moustache/beard trimmed between visits to the barber.</li>
    <li> For purposes of laziness and old age, where I can do what I want now, I decided to let my facial hair grow to 4-6- days length.&lt;br /&gt;This Trimmer is prefect for a fast run over the face and saving me a lot of time with my shaver.  I run the blade @ a 90 degree angle to my beard and it works perfect for that rough look.... A big plus.  Not made in China!...</li>
    <li> I have coarse facial and other body hair.  This thing cuts through it all like butter leaving a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head with clippers for about 14 years now and have slowly gone shorter and shorter. Now I don&#x27;t use a guard so that I can get the shortest cut possible. I&#x27;ve been using the same great clippers from Forfex the entire time and love them. But I&#x27;ve been looking for something that will cut even shorter. Since I have sensitive skin I can&#x27;t shave my head with a razor, plus I&#x27;m not sure I really want to, but I still want to cut my hair as short as possible.  After a lot or research I decided to purchase the Andis Professional 04603 Outliner clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received them last week and have cut my hair 3 times with them already. There are several things I love about these clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. They cut incredibly well and super close. I don&#x27;t think you can cut any closer without actually shaving your head.&lt;br /&gt;2. They are very easy to use without risk of gouging or nicking your scalp. I was really concerned with this since reviews on a lot of other &amp;#34;balding&amp;#34; clippers said you had to be very careful or you&#x27;d cut yourself. That&#x27;s not the case with these.&lt;br /&gt;3. They have some weight to them although not too much.  This allows for nice control while cutting but there isn&#x27;t risk of fatigue while using them.&lt;br /&gt;4. They&#x27;re quiet compared to other clippers I&#x27;ve used and heard at the barber shop when my son gets his hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;4. They&#x27;re well built and made in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Didn&#x27;t come with a bag to store them in so I&#x27;ve been using the original box for now.&lt;br /&gt;2. There isn&#x27;t a blade guard to protect it while not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m extremely happy with these clippers.  I wish I had bought them sooner and I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> These work fantastic. These are the best for trimming around ears and nape. Can&#x27;t go wrong. This is a great addition for all professionals.</li>
    <li> This product continues to do well by me.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Not sure why the box was in Spanish. Works fine.ill but from them again.  Cuts great</li>
    <li> Works good. Just don&#x27;t leave it in a bathroom or shower wear there is steam buildup because it will rust shut. It&#x27;s also a little noisy. Otherwise it works well.</li>
    <li> Does what I need dry shaving</li>
    <li> This thing is just designed badly. There is a small plastic finger that slots into a groove which eventually skips out rendering the entire unit useless. I made an attempt to repair it with disappointing results. This thing is waaayyy overpriced. After taking it apart and comparing it side by side with a $12 travel trimmer I found at a local Marshalls, they are literally almost identical. The mechanical design is the same and it will probably be prone to the same failure as this unit. I pampered this trimmer, keeping it in the original box, cleaning it after every use (which was only once each morning before work) yet still it refuses to trim, once that little finger goes it doesn&#x27;t matter how fancy or powerful the motor is it is useless.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a personal landscaper. My previous cheapo Wahl model was channeling Edward Scissorhands and left some ghastly wounds. This Outliner is the bee&#x27;s knees. As a female... I was looking for something extra gentle and effective. This fit the bill. It&#x27;s extremely powerful (in fact, it trips my breaker every time I use it - I live an old house). Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> cuts close but not too close....saves me from razor bumps like the ones designed for mustaches and beards, which are actually too close for my head to shave...</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really say anything that hasn&#x27;t already been said about these. They are a must have for any barber.</li>
    <li> This trimmer seems heavy duty, but did a poor job of outlining!  It seems dull from the beginning!  It also vibrates so hard your hand hurts within one minute!  It is definately not worth the money!</li>
    <li> Machine get to hot in few mints which is not good at all, after every use you have to let the machine cool down, before buying must check the review.</li>
    <li> Excellent reliable trimmer seems like it will last a long time. Well made. I might have to order the T blade though, my own fault. I&#x27;ve tried just about every professional trimmer out there and so far this is the best.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my own personal use. Very well made. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll never have to buy another one. One small problem I have is, it seems to vibrate quite a bit. But overall a very nice trimmer.</li>
    <li> I just got this trimmer tonight, but I already love it! I got it for two purposes: to trim my beard down so that I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and to manscape, and boy does it manscape! This trimmer passes the Ball-sack Test of Smooth Shaving! But if you&#x27;re not looking to shave your nads, it also works great anywhere else, without chafing or damaging skin, and it is a close trim!</li>
    <li> Work&#x27;s great will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> My barber uses this product and now I have one at home to trim up beteen haircuts.</li>
    <li> came already opened inside the original box , no signs of previous use, Overall it still looked and works new so im happy</li>
    <li> Repaired 2 times in 18 months - I don&#x27;t call that a quality product. Same problem both times - the blade becomes misaligned and on the shortest setting, the blade itself is making direct contact with my scalp, resulting in irritation and/or cuts.</li>
    <li> really good product. strong motor and pretty sharp. when I bought them, I didn&#x27;t know the difference between regular liners and t-liners, so I expected them to be sharper. but trims well regardless. just don&#x27;t leave on for too long, motor gets hot.</li>
    <li> great out-liner exactly what i was looking for. i cant shave with blade and this guy save me a lot of money in barbery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;con&lt;br /&gt;in long periods of use it gets a little bit hot,</li>
    <li> I used this product and was fascinated by it. I had to get one for myself. It is really cool.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while now. it is great and I will definitely buy another one. If you are looking for a fresh clean line up every time you step out of you door this is the right kind to get.</li>
    <li> Purchased a T blade so I can switch the blades to fit my needs</li>
    <li> Great product.  Excellent right out of the box.  Would recommend this product. Already have the clippers.  Great combination for quality grooming.</li>
    <li> These are still the champ in my opinion.  They are not as sharp as the Wahl Detailers but they will do the job and they are powerful and durable.  One set of clippers if properly cared for can last for years and I mean years.  I have had these since 2003.</li>
    <li> This puppy works really well and has done right by me! Go and get you one if you are still thinking about it!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome trimmer. Owned several of these love the bigger power switch with the new models...Had to send it in to andis for service got it back in 2 weeks or so with a new blade very happy! Customer for life</li>
    <li> Great liner nice for and sharp for professional line up. It shipped on time and in great condition , a great choice to go with</li>
    <li> Excellent beard trimmer. Work good, last long time.  Continually oil a few drops after every other use for maximum sharpness.</li>
    <li> Great trimmers, I&#x27;ve been purchasing and using this brand for over a decade.. I bought my last pair in 98 and would still have them if I didn&#x27;t plug them into the wrong voltage. I just bought new blades when they required them which wasn&#x27;t that often. I perfer the T liners though, because I can use them better.</li>
    <li> I go the clippers I wanted and needed, for those of us that dry shave and don&#x27;t have to worry about those damn razor bumbs!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it much. The problem with this product is, it gets too hot very quickly. After about 5 minutes of usage, it gets hot. You have to let it cool for about 15 minutes before you can use it again. That&#x27;s not good if you&#x27;re on the go. Don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small and easy to use .  Great for staying groomed between appointments for the hair.  I have had the larger one for years.</li>
    <li> Gets extremely hot!!! It burns my hand while working</li>
    <li> This item doesn&#x27;t cut as close as advertised, will not buy again.</li>
    <li> My other set of edger&#x27;s died and before I jumped in my car to buy one in town I searched Amazon and of course found exactly what I was looking for and been using them for a week now all is good!!</li>
    <li> Junk. The blade does not cut after a few months of use.</li>
    <li> Does a nice job, no malfunctions in over 6mos of almost weekly use trimming my son&#x27;s and my hair. Gets a little warm but not excessively so. Quiet, comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> This product did not last long. It packed up within a year. I am quite sad about it but my boyfriend&#x27;s own, which is way older than mine still works. I wonder what happened, I took really good care of it.</li>
    <li> For those of you out there that have thick hair and get bumps after shaving, this item is for you!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this because I can shave close and look clean without damaging my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are perfectly sharp so they give a close cut with precision and don&#x27;t cut my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also they are nice and quiet and easy to clean as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend these!</li>
    <li> This Andis cuts very close if you got against the the grain. If you have ingrown hair issues I don&#x27;t risk going against the grain for a super short gut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that it&#x27;s too powerful for my needs but it&#x27;s all I have for now.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to try and Oster that a bit quieter.  You can still get ingrowns with this Andis, you have to be careful not to go too short.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer it takes a little tweeting but once you set the blade and tune it it hits like no other</li>
    <li> im diggin these, they cut very close, and they are far better than the older brand i once had,  thanks</li>
    <li> Cuts pretty good edgeups but gets hot fast.</li>
    <li> Was using a lesser Andis $30 clipper to dry shave and it kept pulling hairs, so knowing how good other Andis have been in the past I spent more to give these a try. Excellent clipper, well worth the money for those who shave their face with these. Cuts through the hair like butter for a shave not far off a razor.</li>
    <li> These trimmers are awesome, great, easy to handle, competitively priced and user-friendly. Andis&lt;br /&gt; got it right with this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the percision workmanship!</li>
    <li> I shave with this every week and it hasn&#x27;t malfunctioned on me so far. Shaves nice, but if you lookin for a smooth clean shave stick to a straight razor. I think there is a way to speed it up for a closer shave by adjusting the screw inside, but I&#x27;m good, I don&#x27;t need to shave my skin off.</li>
    <li> Great for everyday trimming and facial shaving!  Pretty good and efficient for the price.  Never have to buy another trimmer ever again</li>
    <li> After seeing these featured on the Steve Harvey show I ordered for my husband and son. They love them! They are not bulky or noisy like the last pair of trimmers we ordered. They are easy to hold and use. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> No guards or blade cover which caused the blade to start to rust other than that cuts good and leaves skin smooth</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok! But the blade was not Sharpe enough</li>
    <li> Good transaction, no problems. cuts  what its needs to cut. Just the way it should be. nothing more to add</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to any one.&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, It arrived super early. 5 out of 5 stars for that.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, Since i received it in February, I have not set foot in a barber. I&#x27;m usually at the barber every two weeks. Would be there a lot more often but that can get expensive.&lt;br /&gt;My only disappointment is that it is not as sharp as I hoped, even after adjusting the blades. But it is still pretty sharp. It can become hot after about 15 minutes of continuous usage as well.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s awesome. 5stars!!!!!!! (y)</li>
    <li> The T-outliner also from Andis is way better... This one was a very bad experience. Not only it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as I expect it and it&#x27;s too sensitive it had dropped once on the floor and never work again.</li>
    <li> My youngest son took mine as he left for college.  He liked the comb attachments for his beard plus you can just about shave with this.  Not as close as a blade but probably comparable to electric shaver.  So I purchased another.  Everything you have heard about the Andis Outliner Trimmer is true.  Its been around for a long time and is as popular as ever.  Excellent for trim and shape of your beard with this.  I suppose you could outline the back of someone&#x27;s hairline at their neck but I can&#x27;t do that alone.</li>
    <li> Excellent clipper. Cuts hair really short and you don&#x27;t feel anything. No pulling or scratching. Smooth motor runs cool. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Far better to buy a professional grade trimmer once than to repeatedly buy the consumer-grade. I use a trimmer every other day to maintain my near-baldy haircut, this heavy use would destroy the cheap drugstore models in 6 months to a year. Looking forward to at least a decade for this one. Nice solid all-metal construction. No battery to replace.</li>
    <li> Great clippers with smooth operation and good power!  I was surprised that they were not very sharp.  Had them sharpened, but still not as sharp as what I want.  I recommend these clippers.</li>
    <li> For 7 years, I&#x27;ve had an Outliner II that I&#x27;ve used on a regular basis as a way to trim my moustache and keep my facial hair clean without having to deal with razor bumps and irritated skin. Barbers say that this the gold standard for trimming and touch-ups, and I&#x27;d have to agree - the product is durable, the blades stay relatively sharp (although you need to replace/maintain them on regular intervals, as with any trimmer), and it cuts close without irritating the skin. If you opt to buy the trimmer attachments, you can maintain a stubble or close beard with the Outliner as well, enhancing its versatility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can really think of is that you need to have a steady hand and some patience, as the width of the blade and lack of a pivoting head can lead to the occasional slip-up when doing precise trimming. But this can happen with any set of clippers, and is easily overcome with enough experience. If you&#x27;re looking for a trimmer with a higher margin of error, invest in one of those Wahl beard/moustache trimmers - they have a much smaller edge than the Outliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, if you&#x27;re looking for something to shape facial hair and/or maintain a bump-free \\&quot;shave\\&quot; without spending continual $ on special razor blades and astringents, I don&#x27;t think the Outliner can be beat.</li>
    <li> They we&#x27;re exactly what I expected them to be when I ordered them and they arrived a little before the estimated date they told me which was great.. Always wanted the same kinda clippers they had in the black barber shops...... 10 stars from me...YUP!</li>
    <li> bought this to a friend. He needed this machine and he got  so happy when he received it. It&#x27;s working good and he is shaving his head everyday, I think Lol.</li>
    <li> Terrible trimmers. They are absolutely not worth the money. They do not cut hair/beard. They just pull.</li>
    <li> Arrived early , clipper is a very excellent product . i should have purchased years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this And is product&#x27;</li>
    <li> Very Professional Trimmers. I love the quality of the product and how well it performs!! Definately some that are going to be kept for a long time....</li>
    <li> Very good clippers. Able to get that close cut feeling and look like leaving the barber shop. No other clippers come close.</li>
    <li> Clipper is very portable and looks very nice but generates excessive heat.</li>
    <li> Outlines good I would like to know how to sharpen it a liytle more</li>
    <li> My husband loves this trimmer.  He usually has to buy one every year, but these Andis trimmers&#x27; seem to last two or more years, depending upon the type of care it receives or the amount of use.  These appear to give quite a close shave without the need for a razor.  He does not get razor bumps and he has a nice smooth shave.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer. I use it to shave my head—leaves a little stubble, but it&#x27;s much closer than regular clippers. It&#x27;s like what the barber uses to trim neck lines and sideburns.</li>
    <li> Works nicely. Gets the job done. Shaves close and clean. The unit doesn&#x27;t get too hot in the hand during use.</li>
    <li> Watch out, this one can cut you if you don&#x27;t use a guard.  But that&#x27;s to be expected and the blade is so sharp you almost don&#x27;t know you&#x27;ve been cut.  Bottom line:  buy and use the blade guards.  As far as ANDIS goes, they are top-of-the-line in clippers; I&#x27;ve owned their horse grooming clippers (used for pet grooming) for 10 years and it&#x27;s 100% quality.  This one should be no different.  But buy the Set4 Snap On Combs #04640 with it.</li>
    <li> Works great, I love it... Exactly what I was looking for to grow my clientele. I will be buying more soon.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted a pair of these. The price was great and they work like a dream. I cut my sons hair and they love the results. The don&#x27;t even go to a professional barber. I have already passed the word about this product. If I ever need to get anything else I will definitely get it from here.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin so can use straight razor. This is perfect for shape ups and keeping beard clean. Make sure you use oil to keep blades from slowing down</li>
    <li> These are great clippers and line up Very sharp. I am just starting out in the barbering world and I feel like these particular liners give and awesome shape up but are not too sharp to where they will cut you. Great clippers for doing bald fades as well, only problem is they get hot fast so I keep a pair of Wahl Detailers and alternate between the two. If your looking for professional quality and longevity these are the liners/trimmers for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer in Sept of 2013.  It worked pretty good in the beginning but over the last 18 months, it has declined.  A few months ago, I stopped cutting all together.  I have taken good care of this trimmer.  I purchased the cool care along with it and I use cool care almost every time after trimming.  Of course, the warranty is no longer good, so I&#x27;m going to have to purchase a new trimmer.  What a waste of money.  Save your money and get a different brand.</li>
    <li> I used it at home for trimming and it works great!</li>
    <li> For some reason, I have cut my own hair since September 2001. I am very satisfied with this product. Being a retired Army Sergeant Major I take much pride in my appearance and this clipper really gets the job done. The fine hairs on the lower part of my neck nor the thick ones on the sides were no problem. This product has my endorsement.</li>
    <li> Cuts very close and very strong and durable. Andis always makes great pruducts and I reccomend them every time. I love it.</li>
    <li> It all of a sudden stopped working, like it was barley coming on and dead on batteries. Only, it doesn&#x27;t user batteries.&lt;br /&gt;I tried different outlets in different areas, in my apt and at a friends house, same issue.&lt;br /&gt;Tried shaking it then or hitting it to bring it back to life, but no luck .&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t shave my head, just average length 2 - 3 day facial hair every once in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s definitely an electrical problem with these things</li>
    <li> I would have given this product 5 stars, but it stopped working(for no apparent reason) after 7 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something this expensive should not stop working that early on, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I am pleased... Except that the advertisement said that it came with guards which I did not see. Other than that, nice product.</li>
    <li> THE PRICE IS GREAT REALLY HARD TO BEAT BUT THESES CLIPPERS GET NICE AND HOT AFTER A WHILE.GOOD PRODUCT,KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!</li>
    <li> Love these Outliner trimmers, I keep a damp towel for in between cuts, clippers/trimmers run hot regardless. Glad these are not the T outliners, that makes em too long, while edging with the T outliners I usually cut my eyebrows, these trimmers does the job, mines came zeroed already or close to for that matter. Great choice!</li>
    <li> They work good, not as described tho. When your doing line ups or beards it doesn&#x27;t cut the hair like it should. You have to go over the spot 2 - 4  times over and over again, really frustrating! I heard a lot of great things about these trimmers. I&#x27;ve realized they are not that good, as people say! That&#x27;s just my opinion! God bless!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried and tired to \\&quot;adjust\\&quot; the blade as indicated on numerous websites.  And still this razor (when using a comb) will grab and tear at my beard.  I&#x27;ve had this thing rip entire hairs and follicles right out of my face - leaving small bloody crater.  (no kidding)  I wish I&#x27;d never bought this torture device.</li>
    <li> Great product that does the job.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I got it brand new in the box as expected and on time as well the product work great but I wish it was a Lil sharper with line up maybe try the t outliner next time</li>
    <li> Love the machine itself but my damnn blade has rust on it not happy with that, seems used! Someone get back to me  yfc1612@gmail.com</li>
    <li> Use these clippers multiple times a week.  Very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is really good .. so far i love it after probably 20 or so haircuts i given .. the only problem is that it gets pretty damn hot.. other than that its a great buy especially for the price .. THIS TRIMMER IS PRO STATUS</li>
    <li> This item met expectations thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> I always read reviews.. I hate to buy things twice.. So I spring for the better stuff most of the time.. This product doesn&#x27;t disappoint.. I use it only for my &amp;#34;beard/goatee&amp;#34; but my hair styleist? uses the same one..</li>
    <li> This product is advertised and promoted by none other than Steve Harvey himself . This product was a gift but it works very well. Fantastic price too</li>
    <li> Clipper works well, had it for almost 4 months now. I use it to shave my face since my skin is too sensitive for a razor.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you clean with blade wash and oil it after use.</li>
    <li> Being a professional barber this is always my go to tool</li>
    <li> Clean and very quiet motor. I really appreciated how cool they stayed while I was cutting hair. A must buy.</li>
    <li> I returned the Andis GTX Trimmers and purchased the Andis Outliner II which IMHO is a much better trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The positives - a convenient on/off thumb switch, much quieter motor than the GTX model, the blade is slightly sharper out of the box than the Andis GTX was and cheaper in price.&lt;br /&gt;The negatives - no attachments included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the Andis Outliner II Trimmers......HIGHLY!!!</li>
    <li> STOP WORKING AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I WANT MY MONEY BACK&lt;br /&gt;THEY RIPPED ME OFF&lt;br /&gt;DONT BUY THIS&lt;br /&gt;ITS CHEAP&lt;br /&gt;SMH</li>
    <li> The outliner works as stated, the on/off toggle is a little tough. The motor is quiet. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my fiance.&lt;br /&gt;He has to go to the barber once a week atleast, almost 2 to get a shave.  He wanted something that he would be able to do himself and home and save some $$.  He loves it.  His hair is really course and he gets bumps almost everytime he goes to the barber.  With this, he cleans it regularily and rarely gets bumps anymore.  It is a nice close shave and makes the lines that you would get from going to the barber.  It is not as loud as people are expressing on here, but it does get warm after a while of using...which is pretty normal with any type of shaver.  Would buy again for him when this one goes south.</li>
    <li> I only use this now instead of a razor. Works great, my bumps have disappeared</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I was looking for in a trimmer, a bit difficult to use and heats-up too fast. Should have selected a model with adjustable guides.</li>
    <li> I have had the same set of clippers of 15years. I have dropped the several times. These things are better than a Timex watch. I use them three to four times a week to shave my head. People are constantly asking what I shave with. Even barbers ask. Once I tell them, they are surprised and amazed. If you are thinking about buying a pair, think no more. Pull the trigger. They will be the first and last pair clippers you will ever buy. Think of all the money you will save in razors, shaving cream and other shaving equipment.</li>
    <li> ANDIS OUTLINER II IS AWESOME! Very precise and clean. I got both the T Outliner and this one just to  see the difference and just to have in general so if one gets to hot I have another outliner in my arsenal. The T Outliner is much better overall because its kinda hard to get around the ears with the Outliner II but the Outliner II is very precise and I feel a better and closer cut (and those who I&#x27;ve cut hair). I already got the Pro-Mate blades on the T Outliner and Imma bling out this outliner with the Pro-Mate also. Recommend it HIGHLY!!!</li>
    <li> Great trimmer.  Clean cuts, easy to service, should last a lifetime.  Lives up to its reputation.</li>
    <li> love it does exactly what I hoped it would do. Outlines your face, it is a close cut and close shape up.</li>
    <li> I took a star off due to the fact that this clippers motor runs extremely HOT after about 5 minutes turned on. (For some people this might be a problem and they might need to turn the clippers off  for a minute or so to cool down, for me I just deal with it and continue to run mine)  However I enjoy Andis Clippers for their closeness and their ability to give a sharp superb haircut/shape-up...You can even buy the Andis T-Blade attachment to fit this clipper instead of buying a whole new clipper set if you choose to. I am happy with this purchase and I&#x27;m an Andis fan, I just wish the clippers didn&#x27;t run HOT after about 5 minutes turned on, other then that no issues great clippers !</li>
    <li> Now this is what I consider great value for your money. I use this machine to line up my hair line every other day and it has never disappointed. It&#x27;s quite, precise and easy to maneurver. My only negative comment is that it gets hot after a while! But I never use it that long anyway and besides . . . .I see this machine at all barber shops in TnT so there must be something rally special about this outliner. GREAT JOB ANDIS :-)</li>
    <li> Andis make great trimmers! I use it on my face and for edging my hair. It gives a nice and close cut. I recommend this trimmer to anyone, I did have to adjust the blade a little upon arrival in order to get the sharp cut.</li>
    <li> they give such a great cut and i would buy them again</li>
    <li> cuts closer than the other andis t-outliner i have. awesome cuts, crisp lines.</li>
    <li> not a good product, don&#x27;t like it.  it not worth as it is.  I would not buy this in the</li>
    <li> Super high quality.  I use these to shave my face every 2-3 days (to keep 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look) and to trim when I cut my own hair.  Don&#x27;t buy junk sold at department stores.  These are the real deal.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Outliner II for a few months now and I can say that it is the worst purchase I have made this year.  It overheats in less time than it takes to trim a two-day old beard.  The motor has already gone out, probably because they use a magnetic motor.  It trims worse than my cheap, store bought Wahl that has lasted for years.  I have nothing good to say about this trimmer or the company, who has yet to answer any emails concerning the warranty.  I would keep shopping if I were you!</li>
    <li> Very nice, I needed a good. Clipper for my strong beard,  got one formally from another shop and I was nt impressed. I just took my chances after a friend recommended the Andis clippers. And now is so superb compare to what I thought</li>
    <li> Work Good For The First Time Blade Did Not Last And Machine Running Hot After Five Minute And Very Noisy.</li>
    <li> Great clippers and the only ones I use for my beard</li>
    <li> I use this item for lineups.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase</li>
    <li> Its good, it outlines well.</li>
    <li> So far, I like it.  Trims close and easy to use.  Easy to hold on to.</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as my Oster</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat price, and it works.</li>
    <li> I found the outliner about the same as the older/cheaper one I replaced.</li>
    <li> All the barber shops I&#x27;ve been to have all used this shaver to line up hair after they&#x27;re finished cutting it. It always gives a nice clean shave without any hair in sight, so that got me thinking. I&#x27;m tired of wasting money on weak beard shavers that leave me looking like I haven&#x27;t shaved all day after I just finish using them. I&#x27;m currently using this as a beard shaver and it works great. Leaves me with a nice clean shave, probably as close as you&#x27;re going to get without using a razor.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Great Item! Item just as described!</li>
    <li> It does the job I expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m of African descent and have been using multi blade disposable razors on my face for years. After seeing an Andis brand clipper on the Steve Harvey Show I decided to give it a try. I must say that after a few weeks of use I am totally razor bump free. Obviously they do not cut as low as a razor but the lack of discomfort from bumps and nicks far outweigh the lack of a razor type shave. The only minor thing that annoys me is the highly reflective surface on the base of the blade. When I hold the clipper at a certain angle It reflects my bathroom mirror light obscuring the surface been trimmed. Wished it was flat black or something less reflective.</li>
    <li> great item for a great price!!!</li>
    <li> Thank you very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Everything great.... Thanks</li>
    <li> If they stayed sharp longer, I would gladly give this product all 5 stars.  Unfortunately it lost a great deal of its sharpness after a few uses even when I consistently lubricated the blades.  I could always purchase sharper blades or have the existing blade sharpened but I&#x27;ve use much cheaper trimmers that did not have such an observable reduction in their cutting efficiency.</li>
    <li> I WAS LOOKING FOR A TRIMMER THAT WOULD TRIM MY BEARD WITH PRECISION AND COMFORT. THIS ONE DOES IT ALL, A VERY CLOSE TRIM WITHOUT PINCHING, SMALL ENOUGH TO TRIM EAR , AND NOSE HAIRS, AND QUALITY CONSTRUCTION. I AM VERY SATISFIED.</li>
    <li> Cuts through my hair like butter</li>
    <li> Perfect Trimmers I ever came across, Cuts beautifly, you will not need a barber for a line up no time soon.</li>
    <li> Cut perfect líneas, but es tooo hot¡¡¡</li>
    <li> Product was delivered on time and was ready to go right out of the box. I didn&#x27;t.have to adjust the blades. Pleased with purchase</li>
    <li> This product is crap. The Gillette trimmer that I bought at rite-aid for $15 works way better. At the beginning it worked great, but just after five uses, it just hums, no power. After five uses, it became defective for no apparent reason. Do not buy this product, as many people have had the same exact problem as I did. For a professional grade trimmer to stop working after five uses, really doesn&#x27;t much about being a professional grade.</li>
    <li> I have owned a pair of Outliner II&#x27;s for the better part of the past 10 years and I must say they are the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned for shaving and shaping up your beard and hairline. They are stronger than the other Andis clippers that have the T shaped blades (haven&#x27;t tried the GTX though). But more importantly, these things LAST!!! You will naturally have to make sure to get new blades every 10 months or so but the clippers themselves are incredibly sturdy. When I bought mine, it was like $80 from a beauty supply store back in the early 2000s, so this is a steal. Those same pair that I bought 10yrs ago finally broke recently (the cord got ripped out of the base of the clippers due to years of the cord tangling while I&#x27;m shaving) but they probably would have lasted longer had I taken better care of them.</li>
    <li> Great product!!! this trimmer is very powerful. The seller shipped product very fast, and I saved around $30; what more can I WHAT A GREAT DEAL.</li>
    <li> It did a good job, gave a very close cut but broke during first use. Turned it on again and blade is not moving at all, only noise and burnt smell...</li>
    <li> This trimmer is very good.  Cuts close.  Nice and quiet.  So far I don&#x27;t think you can attach an clips on it for size.  But very good.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a Christmas gift to replace my husband&#x27;s old G model which he had for years. Andis. products are reliable so we expect several years of use from this trimmer as well.</li>
    <li> been wanting one for a while now finally got it and its exactly what I expected cuts perfect and its powerful and smooth</li>
    <li> I use this trimmer for personal use for about three months at this point, mainly to cut a bald head. Quiet smooth cut on the first pass. Yes, I would recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> BEST OUTLINER OUT THERE</li>
    <li> This is the best hair cutting tool, hands down!  I&#x27;ve used several others over the years.  This Andis Outliner II is WAY above the rest in quality and performance.  It has a really long cord, which is also a plus.  I use this tool to cut, trim, and shape my husband&#x27;s hair and beard.  He uses it to shape his moustache and facial hair.</li>
    <li> The performance is much better than the t-blade version but the one i got was kinda dull so watch out you guys</li>
    <li> I love the square blade if u have two t outliners buy just the square blade</li>
    <li> Great product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is very powerful.  Not only does this trimmer trim extremely well. It trims even the sensitive parts of the body perfect with no feeling, so no need to worry about hurting yourself. They give you that fresh out the chair feeling, at no in the chair cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely happy that I purchased these trimmers.  You won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a year now it&#x27;s still work great for me. Cuts perfect and close either wet or dry....it does a great job hiding my gray always. I have been using other close cut shaving clippers and definitely this one is the winner. definitely, this has become my favorite and personal trimmer.</li>
    <li> LOVE these! I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair* for nearly a decade, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased a pair of outlining clippers. It is amazing how polished-off they make your haircut look. Although I&#x27;ve used other clippers to clean up the edges--particularly above my ears--I didn&#x27;t expect it to make such a world of difference. These outliners give a very smooth line, and they don&#x27;t require a second passover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they are alright to shaved with. You can get a close cut with no razor burn, but they don&#x27;t glide along your face very well, and I find it takes more time to shave with these than it does with a normal razor. They are excelled for outlining the hairline along the neck, around the ears, sideburns, etc. Great product, A+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*traditional men&#x27;s cut-- 1&amp;#34; on the top, shaved gradient on the sides.</li>
    <li> Pros:  Solidly made.  Very precise and VERY close trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Heavy.  Can be awkward to maneuver because of its large body, weight and the attached electrical cord. (These issues may not be problematic for someone who&#x27;s trimming someone elses hair; I trim my own.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the unit&#x27;s good features make putting up with the cons a fully OK trade-off.  &#x27;Tho I like the lightweight, flexible, and smaller high-end battery powered trimmers, this unit&#x27;s ability to perform the job it&#x27;s meant to do is (trim hair closely and precisely) is superb.</li>
    <li> This trimmer does a really great job on keeping my sideburns, hair and mustache trimmed.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t really like it because it heats up after 5 minutes of using this outliner trimmer and makes a noisy sound, i would said not really a professional tool to use on the barbershop.</li>
    <li> Great Product. I used it for the first time the other day. It gave me the close cut I was looking for all this time.</li>
    <li> These were made for a professional, which I am not, but I can appreciate the great job that they do trimming my beard.  I&#x27;ve purchased quite of few of the cheaper, battery operated trimmers and most were not well made, or didn&#x27;t trim close enough.  All except the Andis Trimmer, scratched my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;The Andis Personal Trimmer is well made, trims very close and is very comfortable to use.  It DOESN&#x27;T scratch my face.&lt;br /&gt;If you need a great trimmer, this is it.  Buy a container of Andis Clipper Oil when you buy the trimmer, so that you can maintain it properly in the long haul.  It comes with a very small tube of oil, but that won&#x27;t last more than a couple of months.</li>
    <li> Love them I keep them clean and well oiled to do the job they are designed to do and they haven&#x27;t disappointed me yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair with the same oster classic 76 since the 90s. I believe that a product should be good enough to where if you take care of it that it&#x27;ll last a long long time. I&#x27;ve been skeptical in replacing my beard trimmer and I wanted one that was as good as my hair clipper and I think this is going to be the one. Everything is tight, sharp, the switches snap nice and tight and it&#x27;s a nice heavy trimmer that you can tell will last for a long long time if you take care of it. Heavy duty cord and a strong motor. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> out there.  I use it to trim my facial hair whenever i don&#x27;t want to shave or just want to have a five o&#x27;clock shadow.  I&#x27;ve try different outliners out there and nothing has come close to perfection as  Andis Outliner II.  After not being satisfied by my last outliner ( Wahl ) I asked my barber who recommended I try Andis.  I definitely recommend it if you&#x27;re looking to trim your beard before shaving or just to have a shadow.</li>
    <li> I have used the Andis for years. This will be my third Andis in apprx 14 years. I cut my own hair and this is great for shaving and edging.</li>
    <li> Straight out of the box, these trim the beard WAY closer than my other Wahl clipplers, WITHOUT catching my follicles or leaving the red dotted lines.  I hate shaving with a razor and hate clipper burn.  With these, I&#x27;ll be rockin the 2pm shadow everyday!!!</li>
    <li> Best trimms ...make me look like a professional uncertified..ha</li>
    <li> These clippers are great ! They really cut close and fast. Much&lt;br /&gt; Better than I imagined they would.&lt;br /&gt;You need to try them!</li>
    <li> Seems like a quality product, solid and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Price was fair, a product that seems to be worth the money.</li>
    <li> Amazingly close shave. Really nice and quiet.</li>
    <li> Excellent at trimming especially if you adjust the blades..I only wish it would be better with some attachments...</li>
    <li> Works well, but you must stay on top of the maintenance!</li>
    <li> Most professional homecut outliner out there, worth the price</li>
    <li> This review is being written by a man of serious Italian heritage, and let me tell you, it comes out in the beard and the hair.  I was one of two guys in middle school with a goatee, and if I am not trimming and shaving pretty much every day, I can start to make Chewbacca jealous.  So needless to say, these little Justin Beeber B.S. trimmers you find at Wal-Mart, would be put to better use holding up shelves or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is absolutely not to be confused with this monster.  I usually prep my face with a few slaps to get ready for all the yanking and pulling with the other trimmers, but I don&#x27;t think I would be afraid to cut the grass with this thing.  It plowed through a full few weeks of growth (spent some time comparison shopping) and never even flinched.  Not a single pull or yank of a hair, and I could even dry shave with it.  I&#x27;ve never been able to dry shave with any trimmer in my entire life.  It always has been trim it down, then shave with a razor.  This thing, right to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep it oiled up as it will get hot after some use, and keep up on the maintenance.  Would definitely recommend getting a big bottle of oil with it.  The little one that comes with it runs out pretty quick, and you DO NOT want to run these without oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never own another pair of trimmers as long as I live.  These are the best in 32 years of searching I have found.  Have nothing bad to say about them at all, besides a lil bulky.  But, I&#x27;ll gladly trade that for the power, precision, and quality.</li>
    <li> Great fades and line up</li>
    <li> Forget what you know about traditional hair cutting clippers.  These cut extremely close and are very precise. I had a pair for about three years and replaced the blades once...then dropped them while running.  This is my second trimmer and I wont use anything else.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Durable construction&lt;br /&gt;- High quality 6ft power cable.&lt;br /&gt;- Blades are adjustable and replaceable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Plastic is slippery and has no grip.  Easy to drop and ruin blades&lt;br /&gt;- Gets VERY HOT very quickly&lt;br /&gt;- No adjustment I could find to &amp;#34;tune&amp;#34; the magnetic oscillator&lt;br /&gt;- Stock blade not installed straight</li>
    <li> I thought I had a good thing going with the little $20 Norelco kit that I would purchase every few years. Still a lot cheaper than using a conventional razor which I can&#x27;t use on my face anyways. This time around I was on a recent business trip and put my razor on my \\&quot;throw on the plane bag,\\&quot; mistake. Went to shave up so I can look clean in a visiting office and my razor was dead. My third and final one. Lasted about 5 years, not bad. I figure this time around it was time for a man&#x27;s set of clippers and not a rechargeable cheap razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My barber uses this little gem to edge me up and clean up my face so I decided to get one of my own based on that and the reviews found on Amazon. First shave out the box and I&#x27;m no longer looking like \\&quot;Scruffy Dunlap.\\&quot;  Cut is smooth and close and with the attachments it knocked my beard down with ease (I use a small comb then the clippers method, super curly beard). Shaving under the chinstrap was easy as well. One thing I will mention for you novices, if you haven&#x27;t used a set of barbers clippers you may want to get use to the feel before you start cutting. The motor inside is pretty strong and the unit can feel quite buzzy in your hand. It&#x27;s just like any set of clippers though, whatever direction they go they cut. The attachments weren&#x27;t too sharp in my opinion. Mine are black with metal clips to lock them down. Adds great value to an already strong product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase so far and the attachments (sold separately) make this a complete unit for your face and beard. Young or old you have to keep your face looking right, right fellas? Do yourself a favor and invest in yourself. One.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Been using the Andis for a few days. No razor burn or skin irritation to report so far. Have at it!!</li>
    <li> These are such a great purchase, one of the essential machines for my bathroom.  I can save minimum 5.00 doing my own face and edge ups now and relieve the local barber of my hard earned dollars for awhile!  Great precision product.</li>
    <li> Slight opportunity to use as my expectations were out of line with the clear and limited purpose of this product. With no lengthening guides, it&#x27;s limits of function are for the specific tasks of trimming around ears, back of neck &amp; shaping my beard. In this respect it&#x27;s outstanding, and the quality build assures me this will last for many years. Despite my misguided expectations, this is 1000x&#x27;s better than all those cheap $20 trimmers I&#x27;ve gone through over the years.</li>
    <li> Hubby love these so far so Good ...</li>
    <li> I had the older model this one seems to have a lighter material...</li>
    <li> I used my new shaver/trimmer within first hour of taking delivery. The performance is incredible; I am extremely pleased. I noticed the &amp;#34;fixed square blade&amp;#34; indicated on the package to have been included was unfortunately missing. May I request for this please. I sure appreciate the lightening speed of delivery also. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Closest comparison to a razor without the razor bumps! Does overheat after 20 minutes of use, but not that big a deal.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and in my opinion hands down the best trimmer on the market.  I not only use it to shave my head, but I used it to shave my face too.  I have tried tons of shavers from Wahl Balding to the Peanut to the Andis T-Outliner, but this trimmer is by far the best and is by the far the closest shave you can get with using an actual razor.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even use it I couldn&#x27;t even enjoy using it! I wanted to trim my beard and all of a sudden I dropped it on a sink and the result was all the machine teeth were broken like a toy !</li>
    <li> not as good as i was hoping for gets hot fast i use it at home to cut my head bald&lt;br /&gt; but it was shipped out fast so you didn&#x27;t have to wait for it</li>
    <li> I could not take it with me when I travel since it is only 110 volt and not 110-240 volt.&lt;br /&gt;It gets hot when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;It does not shave completely.</li>
    <li> Great clippers!!! works great and get the job done!!!!! will recommend for anyone who cuts hair i will always go with andis.</li>
    <li> I needed a shaver that what light weight and would give me a close shave. This product was perfect for that</li>
    <li> Great product. Worth the money. I love this product. I&#x27;m a black man who can&#x27;t use razors to shave my face or head. When I have in the past, I&#x27;ve always broke out in large patches of razor bumps. I use this product to shave my facial hair and head. It works like a charm. I cut almost as close as a razor for me. I use this product every other day. I believe I&#x27;ve on this trimmer for over a year now.</li>
    <li> These liners are pretty good.  I prefer the T-Outliners, but these Outliners are just as good.</li>
    <li> Ive used Andis clippers for over 20 years great for a professional line Up</li>
    <li> The trimmer works for me for general trimming.  The equipment feels solid, like it will last forever.  Electric cord length is plenty long for my needs; the cord is more flexible and stays out of the way better than expected.</li>
    <li> exactly what I was looking for to get that professional barber feeling,, Just saved 90% time in just 15 min...</li>
    <li> Very satisfied we decided to go through with this purchase.  We&#x27;ve had this product for a few months and not all disappointed.  It&#x27;s good for quick shape-ups.</li>
    <li> This trimmer cuts nice and close almost like a razor. It arrived on time and I even got a few packets of hair gel. This trimmer works as well as my existing t-outliner which I have had for five years now. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a replacement or back-up trimmer.</li>
    <li> It good quality machine but you have to get the time trimmer to finish the job and it get too hot somwtimes</li>
    <li> Cuts pretty close and doesnt pull my hair. And can see it lasting for a good while.If u need a good beard mustache trimmer get it. Great for leaving a shadow.</li>
    <li> Shaves close to the skin which is what I bought it for. Feels heavy in the hand and well made.</li>
    <li> instrumental in keeping the fighting men of our country&#x27;s morale up one haircut at a time! would recommend them to anyone</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Light and easy to handle. I would recommend this product to everyone that&#x27;s looking for a new clipper.</li>
    <li> Great Trimmer, Works great Etc. Good Price. I Truly Recommend This Brand!!!!</li>
    <li> Andis have had a great reputation in hair cutting environments. Consistency is the key to good clippers. Good clippers at a good price.</li>
    <li> The way the product was described made me think it would be good for trimming my beard to a shadow thickness. Unfortunately it comes with no attachments and the only ones available are not small enough and constantly snag my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is excellent for shaping and giving a close shave! I will keep it around as an alternative to my manual razor; it just didn&#x27;t do what I really needed, which is thin my beard. If you have the precise hands for thinning your beard on your own, without attachments, go for it! But if you are like me and need adjustable sizes/attachments, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This clipper has tons of power but, will not cut a two day medium stubble. Dull and hard to use for dry shaving would not buy another product from andis.</li>
    <li> The Andis Outliner II Trimmer is, in fact, the greatest thing since sliced bread.  I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My father had a very tough full beard.  When he was ill, I would shave him and I used to joke that you could use a cheese grater on his face and he&#x27;d probably get a great shave.  My mother has very fine hair.  So, through the miracle of DNA my beard is very full but the hair itself is baby fine and I am prone to ingrown hairs and nasty bumps.  Back in the 80s, as a much younger man, I shaved once a week whether I needed to or not, and I had stubble all the time.  That was before stubble was cool like it is today, so I fancy myself a trend setter.  But I digress...  For many years I only used a beard trimmer to shave, and then I found an electric razor a while back that was made for sensitive skin and helped a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every year around the holidays I get fed up with packing all these shavers and trimmers when I travel, and I decide that I need to simplify my shaving regimen.  That usually begins with the fantasy of using a regular razor that doesn&#x27;t take up much space in the suitcase and doesn&#x27;t have to be charged.  For some reason, every single year without fail I get the bright idea that after 30 years of the same result, this year is going to be different.  And, I usually celebrate the New Year with a bunch of ingrown hair bumps on my face and a rash around my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Andis Outliner II.  I have probably tried every other brand of beard trimmer over the years, and I stumbled across the Andis trimmer recently on Amazon.  A coworker noticed my search and said that Andis was a great product that his barber used, and that he had one of his own at home.  I felt like an idiot for not finding this sooner, but I ordered the trimmer and when it arrived I was ready to give it a try.  I plugged it in and turned it on and I couldn&#x27;t believe the power and the weight of this thing.  It&#x27;s a bit heavy at first, so you have to get used to that comparedto most other trimmers.  That&#x27;s because it is a Harley Davidson compared to a bicycle.  Right out of the box this thing was fantastic.  I usually use the trimmer after carefully shaving with electric razor, but in testing the Andis I found that I could really press it onto my face without the fear of it biting my skin or pulling any of the hairs.  The factory setting on the blades gave me a great shave.  I could probably get away with just this clipper and be fine.  The blades are adjustable, so you can cut even closer, but I figured I would wait a while before tinkering.  My face felt great.  I then decided to wash up and use my electric razor, and much to my surprise I got the best shave of my life.  It was so easy to shave after using this trimmer that the electric razor had a really easy time and I got a nice smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now the shaving regimen has completely changed.  I use the trimmer first before I shave with my electric razor and I get fantastic results.  I am getting rid of all my other beard trimmers and I will happily pack this thing into my suitcase anywhere I go.  It is a very well made, heavy duty trimmer and I am absolutely sold.  Maybe one day I will adjust the blades, but I don&#x27;t know if I want to mess with perfection.  I am thrilled to finally feel like I have a great solution to what has been a real hassle for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For you guys out there with sensitive skin and ingrown hair problems, this trimmer is fantastic.  Buy it.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I use these trimmers for outlining my self haircuts and beard shaping.  I also use them for shaving.  I have been using these for about 20 years now.</li>
    <li> THE REASON WHY I CHOOSE THIS PRODUCT IS BECAUSE A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE HAS THE SAME ONE AND HE SAID I NEED TO ORDER IT. SO I SAID TO HIM WHY AND HE SAID IT CUT REAL CLOSE TO THE SKIN AND ITS POWERFUL AND FAST. SO THATS WHY I ORDER THIS PRODUCT CAUSE MY FRIEND HAS IT AND IT WORKS GOOD ON HIS HAIR. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE WHO WANTS A CLOSE SHAVE FAST AND EASY.</li>
    <li> These trimmers do exactly what I need them to do. Trim close without causing razor bumps. I have a pair that I brought in 1996 and they still work so why buy any other brand?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s got a powerful engine.  It vibrates like a lawnmower, but that&#x27;s not really my issue with it.  Something in the design pinches and pulls my beard.  My other shaver didn&#x27;t do this till the end of it&#x27;s life, some 5 years after I bought it.  This highly reviewed product earned my dislike from it&#x27;s first use.  It might have other uses like a shaver, but I bought it as a beard trimmer and it&#x27;s just not worth the pain.  Because it&#x27;s already been used, I&#x27;m guessing I can&#x27;t return it, so it&#x27;s basically money wasted on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading the comment below, I think my review was a little harsh.  It is good as a trimmer, it&#x27;s not good as a shaver with the measured beard lengths (the attachments are made by another company).  For my needs, see the first comment below mine, but as a trimmer this works fine.</li>
    <li> I got so tired of my battery operated trimmer always being uncharged when I wanted it and it no longer holding a charge if not plugged in all the time that I purchased this unit. The unit does an excellent job of trimming my mustache and beard and I always have power!</li>
    <li> Have been using for several weeks to line my sons (teen and under 10) hair weekly. Awesome. Crisp. Fast. I also use it to line my hair, goatee, and light shave to prevent ingrown hairs. Significant time saver as sharp enough to get the job done with one pass!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big difference to wahl i have used for years. Does get a bit warm with extended use, but just hold closer to base. Experienced users will love the power and precision. Wish I found it sooner.</li>
    <li> I use the trimmer for my beard, it works great, does not leave stubble, but that&#x27;s what I wanted. Just bought it so don&#x27;t know how long it will be good, but it feels solid and not cheap.</li>
    <li> It stopped working for no reason..</li>
    <li> It is nice, and does not disappoint at all. It worths the money.</li>
    <li> THIS TRIMMER WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED. EXCELLENT VALUE FOR A WELL MADE PRODUCT. KEEPS OUR HAIR TRIMMED WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY A BARBER EVERY WEEK.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I work 2 jobs and often shave only once a week. I can buzz it down fairly quickly with this. It also works great for sideburns and goatee trimming.</li>
    <li> The same consistent product from Andis. Nothing has changed about it over the past 5 years. So if your in need of a new pair then here you go.</li>
    <li> does the job but not the best . If your not picky this will work for you . Good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Best trimmers ever!!!!! They feel perfect when I dry shave with them.. No more razor bumps, nice and smooth... I would recommend to anyone who has issues with razors..  You&#x27;ll love them...</li>
    <li> Its the best clipper you can buy out there. But it gets hot if you use more than 20mins non stop. Like if you decide to shave your head and the beard at once for sure the machine will be very hot and quite difficult to handle. Apart from that the clipper is great!</li>
    <li> I use these clippers for personal use; I shave my head everyday. You cannot beat the quality and cut. They definitely provide a very close shave,so buy attachments if you want a little extra left on top. I also recommend buying some extra oil to keep it lubed up.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no other words to say Andis professional outliner 2 is a great product. Perfect for all around grooming, line ups and a flawless 5 o&#x27;clock look u can master with this clippers.</li>
    <li> I have very curly facial here and as a result suffer from razor bumps when I use a razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;The machine is perfect for giving a close enough shave without having to worry about getting razor bumps/ ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Also works great and a liner to maintain the edge of your haircut</li>
    <li> I have a outliner 2 that my dad had when I was a kid... Well.. I&#x27;m 56 and after using the old one for decades it was time for a new one..&lt;br /&gt;The andis2 works great....</li>
    <li> who is quite particular when it comes to how his hairline is shaped. He seems very satisfied with how well it performs.</li>
    <li> Does your skin break out badly when you shave? I used everything...I used high end razors, cheap Bics and other electric razors.  For me, this thing is great....it shaves the hair down short but not down to the rugged skin.  Its perfect.  My Barber uses it...I remember back in the day you had to show your Barber licenses to get them at the stores.</li>
    <li> yea I would recommend them to anyone. They are very sharp and good for lining up. the trick is to use the side of the blades for those that&#x27;s starting to cut hair</li>
    <li> First of all this product does NOT come with clips.&lt;br /&gt;Second of all, you can order a set of clips but the largest size is only 3/8 inch.&lt;br /&gt;1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 3/8 inch</li>
    <li> Brought this for my boyfriend and he loves it!!</li>
    <li> good product for beard and fades... nice trimming tool.  also good for edge ups and tapers. No problems here. The blades are small so it makes it easier for face. If your thinking about using this just for low cuts around your head i suggest you find another product.</li>
    <li> I used to get Oster trimmers but was tired of having to purchase replacement blades because of the dullness issue. A barber told me about Andis and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s made me buy a pair. These trimmers are surprisingly sharp out of the box and have remained so for 10 months now. I&#x27;ve had to readjust them due to me being lazy not putting them away and having a 3yr old with curious hands dropping them on the floor. Wasn&#x27;t a big deal, unscrewed it, set the blade and I was back in business. To those that say these are dull, try unscrewing and setting the blades to your liking before bashing the product. Anything could have happened during the shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you used it to edge yourself up, mustache and beard it will not get hot. But if you use this as the workhorse clippers and trimmers, do the edge up, mustache and beard first so when the blades get hot it&#x27;s not on your face.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these after having them for a year.  Cut very close and my smallest boy does not complain when I put it right up against his skin. Very quiet and smooth operating clippers.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Item overheats and is very heavy and hard to handle</li>
    <li> not that good for lining need to be shaper and get hot to fast.i realy wonted to send thim back.</li>
    <li> Awesome....but I think it&#x27;s better left in the hands of the pros.  You can give a novice cook a $300 knife but it won&#x27;t make them a chef.  Kinda same principle with this clipper</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, it was replacing a cheap target trimmer that I bought 2 years ago, not only does this trimmer trim extremely well. It trims even the sensitive parts of the body perfect with no feeling, so no need to worry about hurting yourself. I also recommend buying replacement OIL for a few dollars from amazon, if you plan on using this every other day like me.</li>
    <li> Very dull feels like I&#x27;m not even shaving , not cutting close enough that&#x27;s the only reason I got should have saved my money and got something regular at target</li>
    <li> Great clippers for all barbers. If you are new to the profession, this is something you should get on amazon, good price.</li>
    <li> It trims nice on my face. No bumps or cuts. I love it. Keep up the good work andis. Take care</li>
    <li> They dont cut as sharp as I had expected. I feel as tho hair keeps getting pulled as I edge my face</li>
    <li> Excellent barber tool</li>
    <li> Best out there. Keep it clean</li>
    <li> Had a cheap Wahl battery trimmer for a few years prior to this. Battery finally gave out, and I decided to get a corded on this time around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the real deal. Super well built, feels great in the hand, I&#x27;m never worried about the cord fraying or wearing out, and am pretty sure I&#x27;ll pass this on to my grandchildren some day down the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this exclusively for my beard, and coupled it with the Andis #04640 trimmer guards to give me the right length option(s). I oil it every 2-3 uses, the blades have been sharper than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve used, and while it does get a LITTLE warm after 5 minutes of solid operation, it&#x27;s not uncomfortable. I&#x27;ve never really had the need to run it longer, because it does such a good job.  It IS a $50 trimmer instead of your cheap-o other options and it doesn&#x27;t come with a ton of accessories, but if you want to have a trimmer that outlives you and not buy a $25 piece of junk every 3 years...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look no further.</li>
    <li> As Good As Advertised.</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair and sometimes my families. Im black so I go with the fade and it gives me a clean,close, non-overlapping cut. Im happy with them. the blades are good quality and everything. If I had to pick one thing I didn&#x27;t like it would be that when you run the clippers for a while the blades get hot. But if you let them sit for a few minutes they cool down.</li>
    <li> These are not as sharp as I thought they were going to be, they have no way to adjust them. They are perfect for my kids hair, but I can&#x27;t get a sharp line with my own.</li>
    <li> I use it for shaving my face and it works perfectly. we&#x27;ll see how it holds up.</li>
    <li> These work Great just need sharper blades!</li>
    <li> Great pair of clippers! Durable and compact!! Cuts to a T!!</li>
    <li> I chose this brand and this model, it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s very popular and a lot good review about it. But it did not work with me. It just last couple of months like 3.</li>
    <li> love this!! Solid, durable, great quality. Easy to handle and makes lining up easy. Used this about a dozen times on the boys so far and very pleased.</li>
    <li> This clipper cuts with crazy precision. It gets very hot so buy two (get the T-Outliner) to switch between clippers. Keep clipper oil handy to cool it down during use.</li>
    <li> Function and Quality are great. I bought a sharper aftermarket clipper blade which worked out well but be careful if you do because it can cut you. I cut both me and my boys hair and they have been running for years now, it&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it! Best trimmer he has ever used! He cannot shave because of skin irritation, the result on his face using this trimmer is amazing, similar to shaving!</li>
    <li> Not as good as the T-liner</li>
    <li> BEAUTIFUL TRIMMER MY FIRST SHAVE WAS CLEAN A VERY LIGHT WEIGHT TRIMMER SO FAR SO GOOD</li>
    <li> First, shave your head, then shave your pubs.</li>
    <li> wish it was cheaper but admit I have two of them</li>
    <li> I had been buying cheaper Wahl beard trimmers for years.  I tried these at my baber shop and realized that I needed to upgrade immediately.  These cut close, don&#x27;t pull, and have cheap replaceable blade.  You really can&#x27;t beat these.</li>
    <li> I bought it cause they said it was great for dry close shaving and outline, but it is not as close as one would expect. I have a set of clippers and they shave almost as close as the Andis Outliner II Personal Trimmer. I would have same my $$$ if i knew it would be this way.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for over 10 years now.  It retails on average over $100.00, still holding it&#x27;s value.  I got it much cheaper here on amazon and it is worth it.  I shave my head bald twice a week and for a REALLY clean, close shave, this is the shaver to invest in.  I swear by this product and have a few of my relatives using it.  Keep it oiled after every use - or every other use - and it will last you more than 5 years.</li>
    <li> Lo que esperaba de este producto, muy buena marca y muy buen aparato para recortar cabello, la recomiendo a todos que la compre para el recorte de cabello</li>
    <li> I love these clippers.  They cut close like using a razor without the bumps.  Very smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Helps me get a good fade.  Used these for about a year now with no issues.  Definitely a good tool for the at-home barber.</li>
    <li> Andis knew what they were doing when they designed this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this item to anyone with hair.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband as a Fathers Day gift to replace his old outliners... He is really impressed and likes them a lot... He prefers this brand over any other... They line up really well.. the best.</li>
    <li> I was tired and broke expending money in Gillette, shick,etcétera.&lt;br /&gt;This clipper is amazing, wonderful, by fare is my best buy in amazon, I am saving a lot of good money, keeping clean my face, indeed now I shave all my head thanks to my amazing outliner.&lt;br /&gt;If you are tired of expend your money in Gillette, buy it, dp not hesitate, you will not regreat.&lt;br /&gt;Ah forever young is a very good and setious company, very accurate.</li>
    <li> use it every week since i bought it. dont even have to shave anymore</li>
    <li> My clippers came very fast. They were packaged nicely. It&#x27;s exactly what you expect to happen. And I appreciate it!!</li>
    <li> If the unit had worked coming out of the box, I might have been able to write a more definitive review. However, after plugging the unit into the receptacle, I was unable to turn it off. It started to overheat in my hand, and the on/off control knob simply spins around with no on/off function! Called customer service and they asked if I had oiled the blades as instructed; I had. They then wanted to know at what point in time the unit started to overheat. I advised shortly after plugging it in. When I explained that the on/off switch was non-functional I was told to send it back and they would REPAIR it! Excuse me - it is brand new and should be replaced; not repaired! Their customer service is very pleasant in customer interaction, (they are from Wisconsin) but completely ineffective in customer satisfaction! I am being asked to absorb the cost of sending this &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; item back for repair that has never been used - now that is ridiculous!  Don&#x27;t know if the problem is this specific model, but I would stay far away from ANDIS if you are looking for a quality trimmer.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Great for cutting hair, trimming facial hair. High end, professional grade. I use it all the time. It has definitely been worth the purchase. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. Quality, well made. Cheaper here than any beauty supply shop. Will last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> Great deal and great buy. The owners got the products to me in a timely fashion and I will continue to do business with them.</li>
    <li> I have to duct tape the on and off switch,  greatly&lt;br /&gt;disappointed</li>
    <li> I had theses for four months and they died. I bought theses for cutting my own hair, since they are supposed to be for professional use. However, they had problems from day 1, now they don&#x27;t cut hair at all. I always cleaned and lubed after every use. But these are GARBAGE do not buy.</li>
    <li> great product. very close cut.</li>
    <li> This product works well for beard trimming. Excellent for getting those nice outlines and edges. Easy to maneuver and cuts close. I still shave after that though.</li>
    <li> After going through several cheaper trimmers, including cheaper Andis units, they all had their defects or died completely.  I use a trimmer about once a week to shave my head.  This unit has several advantages over the others.  It doesn&#x27;t get too hot after extended use.  It gives a closer shave with no guard.  The switch is easier to operate.  It feels more solid.  I just wish I would of bought this one first.</li>
    <li> I keep my hair as bald as I can with clippers and try to cut it every two days or so.  These pair of clippers are perfect for me because I don&#x27;t have too much hair.  Cut my hair last night and it took less than ten minutes, I was shocked usually with the clippers I&#x27;ve been using I have to go back and forward like a lawnmower just to cut it off.  The only complaint I would give is that this clippers are LOUD but my ears are used to that because that&#x27;s the type of clippers my Mom used to cut me and my brothers hair with.  Definitely worth the shot if you can get pass the noise</li>
    <li> Gets very close to the skin. Awesome for facial hair lineups</li>
    <li> Great Product the usual high standard I have become used to from Andis. It cuts the lines perfectly and sharply.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, WELL WORTH THE MONEY, NEVER AGAIN WILL I HAVE TO BUY A PAIR</li>
    <li> Definitely professional. I like how I can get real close with a fade or even do some touch up for facial hair. It vibrates pretty good, but you get use to it.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Only had it for a week, but I use it every day.  Loving it.</li>
    <li> If you cut any type of hair you must have .. It&#x27;s great item to have !!! I love it and you will too trust me !!!</li>
    <li> On first plug in these edgers are very loud.Maybe I just got a bad pair...I have other andis products that work fine...</li>
    <li> High quality clippers and great customer service through the Andis company.</li>
    <li> Become hot after two minutes of use did not I like&lt;br /&gt;Become hot after two minutes of use did not like it and never buy like and is expensive for the quality</li>
    <li> Fantastic outliner period! No thing bad to say about it quick, precise and feels good in the hand. I only which they can make a hair cutter as fantastic.</li>
    <li> Love these they work really great and just what I needed</li>
    <li> I was looking for an outliner to shape up my beard after trimming it , without it being too sharp. Usually when I outline the back of my head or beard ( using sharper trimmers ) I would see ( what appears to be ) scratch marks or cuts. But this gives me that sharp look , without the discomfort when shaving and no marks afterwards. Overall , I&#x27;m satisfied with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> These look sturdy but the blades did not cut like they should have. They didn&#x27;t seem sharp at all. Didn&#x27;t even seem like the blades were new.  I was very disappointed and was going to return them but I didn&#x27;t try them out until it was too late to return them.</li>
    <li> I ordered 1 pair 3 different times all 3 had defects.. we warned..</li>
    <li> Well made and gives a close shave.</li>
    <li> Works great and cheaper than purchasing in store.</li>
    <li> It came right on time like it a as supposed to and he loves them</li>
    <li> Cuts good from what I see and shipped pretty fast</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected, but the quality is good.</li>
    <li> Great pair of clippers!!!</li>
    <li> My husband loved this gift</li>
    <li> Not crazy about this particular model.  My hair is extremely coarse and it gets caught in the blades periodically.  For foiks with finer hair, this is probably just fine.</li>
    <li> I would reccomend this product to any guy that would like a quick clean shaved head. My husband has gone through a few Whal hair trimmers in the past few years and they don&#x27;t hold up to frequent use.</li>
    <li> Bought this trimmer for my nephew as a birthday gift.  He loves this item and uses quite often to trim up himself and his friends.  He says its a good product.</li>
    <li> I purchased these from Sally&#x27;s at least six years ago and they are still working like the day I took them out of the box. Buy these with confidence.</li>
    <li> I wear my hair skin tight...it Hides the grey...anyways This is the ONLY  company i would buy trimmers from....Do not just use it and put it away....if you are former military then you know about PMing your weapon...you must clean blade after EVERY USE....keep the lubricant on it. Andis makes a spray can lube that is Not A Rip off... If YOU take care of your trimmers they WILL take care of you.</li>
    <li> This is a heavy duty trimmer. I use it for dry shaving and it does a great job. I don&#x27;t like that it is corded but I knew that going in. I didn&#x27;t realize it would be this heavy though. Despite being heavy it is easy to get good clean lines with it.</li>
