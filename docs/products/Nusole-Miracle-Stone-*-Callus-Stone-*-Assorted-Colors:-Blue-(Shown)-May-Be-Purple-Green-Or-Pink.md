<li> The frequency for pedicures has decreased.</li>
<li> It hasn&#x27;t softened up at all and doesn&#x27;t foam for me, and I tend to not use it because it&#x27;s unpleasant.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not a pumice stone which I hate because they seem to gouge my skin creating an unevenness over time.</li>

    <li> I use this product daily when I get out of the shower.  It has solved a long time problem of ugly rough feet.</li>
    <li> These are the Best! I use them on my wet feet in the bath. They lather up the bottoms of your feet great. They remove all dirt and dead skin, so my feet are baby soft.Much better than an expensive, time consuming professional pedicure- where there is Heaven knows what kind of disease you can get from the water and implements they use! (I&#x27;m kind of OCD, I guess)</li>
    <li> One of the best foot products out there! I love this product so much that i had to purchase four more, thanks NuSole!</li>
    <li> This product works BETTER than expected.  No woman should be without this in her shower.   Just follow the directions and you won&#x27;t need a pedicure as often.</li>
    <li> I use this whenever I am relaxing in the bath.  It makes my feet silky smooth, and I like that you card use the product on wet skin.  This works better than any other pumice stone I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> I use the stone about twice a week when I shower.  It really works well on rough skin.  The frequency for pedicures has decreased.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t understand what the product can be used for.  I tried it on my feet but I have a lot of better things than this one from before.  I thought it should make my feet better but perhaps I misunderstood.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for several months, and I use it about twice a week on my feet while I&#x27;m showering.  It hasn&#x27;t softened up at all and doesn&#x27;t foam for me, and I tend to not use it because it&#x27;s unpleasant.  I think I&#x27;m going to look for a different pumice stone and give up on this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this twice and loved it every time. It&#x27;s not a pumice stone which I hate because they seem to gouge my skin creating an unevenness over time. This cleans your feet and softens them instantly and is reusable for forever! I only repurchased because my boyfriend thought it was to clean the toilet and on my next, my niece thought it was candy. Great product and I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I tried to use it and it was too smooth.  Additionally, it was messy and crumbled little blue pieces.</li>
    <li> This callus stone works like a charm. I leave it in the shower and every other day I use it on my calluses to keep them smooth. It works well at smoothing out my calluses without being too abrasive.</li>
    <li> Looks exactly as shown in the picture and does exactly what it was advertised to do.  I don&#x27;t know how someone can really write a review on this kind of product, or when someone gives it a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; review - it was like the time Amazon asked me to write a review about the hammer that I purchased - I mean, it was a hammer!  It&#x27;s the exact same kind of foot stone that the Koreans use on my feet whenever I got get a pedicure.</li>
    <li> This stone works well but due to bacteria, it has to be thrown out about a month or so after.</li>
    <li> I was expecting something with a little more substance.  This is like a coarse piece of foam.  There&#x27;s nothing stoney about it.  It&#x27;s decent I guess at removing dry skin, but I thankfully do not have thick calluses like some people do so it wasn&#x27;t that big a deal to me.. If you have serious skin damage on your feet, this is NOT for you.</li>
    <li> This work effectively at removing dry skin on my feet, but not any better than a normal pumice stone. The description said something about lathering up and led me to believe it would work better than a pumice. It didn&#x27;t. The stone also wore away pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> This product worked well on my dry feet, just like I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised how quickly it arrived in the mail.</li>
    <li> First of all, this stone only lathered once. I used it in the shower, then put it up to dry. The very next time I went to use it, no lather of any kind. I continue to use it because it does work well to tame the callouses, but I could have purchased a non-lathering stone for less money and not missed out on much.</li>
    <li> This product is an okay product but I&#x27;m not sure where the miracle comes from. It works much better on your elbows and knees then it does on your feet.</li>
    <li> Works great so far. I have only used it once and could tell my feet were softer and smoother. It is goo.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money, didn&#x27;t do anything to my feet, but it did leave a gross blue stain on my bathtub.</li>
    <li> was what it says it is</li>
