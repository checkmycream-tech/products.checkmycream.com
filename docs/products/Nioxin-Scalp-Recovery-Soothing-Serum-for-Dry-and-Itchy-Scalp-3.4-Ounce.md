      <li>Awesome product.</li>
      <li>works wonderfully to get rid of the flaky dermatitis on the scalp...</li>
      <li>Good just what I needed.</li>
      <li>Works exceptionally well.  </li>
      <li>Amazing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, it&#x27;s a gel-cream consistency and smells pretty good!  </li>
      <li>Works much more effective compared to the competitors&#x27;.</li>
      <li>Wonderful, the only thing that works on my itchy scalp.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different anti-dandruff products and this is definitely best I have used.</li>
      <li>and I love the results that I have been able to obtain.  </li>
      <li>It might be just me, but this product made my scalp itch even more.</li>
      <li>Excellent product, have been using for several weeks, have see and feel the difference on my scalp</li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;re hoping for more of a liquid, or something that won&#x27;t affect the appearance or feel of your hair, this isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Great product,  really helps if you have itchy scalp.</li>
      <li>Wish it were more available on local shelves but happy that it&#x27;s available at all.</li>
      <li>Smells fine</li>
      <li>It looked like someone had rinsed the bottle out and filled it.  </li>
      <li>I did, however, find that my scalp was paying the price for my fabulous hair.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff and the transaction was smooth and fast.</li>
      <li>True to the manufacturer product.</li>
      <li>First off, the price shown here....just buy the full kit on this website and then it will be more worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I, for about six years, have had a super itchy scalp particularly when I&#x27;m stressed.</li>
      <li>Really works and easy to use</li>
      <li>It would get dry and flaky in a couple of areas and I discovered this serum while looking for a good deal on the System 1 shampoo.</li>
      <li>This product did calm the itchiness but did not help to control flakes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice when something actually works.</li>
      <li>Good for other skin problems</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy that it came in a small size since I took it with me in my purse and applied it as needed throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I used a prescription foam which works pretty well, but didn&#x27;t like that</li>
      <li>I have plaque psoriasis on my scalp, I have tried many many products from over the counter to prescriptions and this is the best product I have found to soothe the scalp and NOT make my hair look nasty and greasy</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using this in combination with the Nioxin step 4 shampoo and conditioner and the deep conditioner, and love the whole line.</li>
      <li>new hair stylist recommended the full scalp recovery system, but it is really the serum that does the trick.</li>
      <li>thinking about also using this to treat athlete&#x27;s foot (it&#x27;s got menthol in it and is very soothing)</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t do much for soothing just burned</li>
      <li>Sometimes hair products really irritate me, but I won&#x27;t know until I try it.  </li>
      <li>Wow!!!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous potions and lotions - several at huge prices - from drugstores and dermatologists for a scaly spot on my noggin for years now &amp; nothing worked but this!</li>
      <li>I have a medical background and knew cause was most likely fungal, so I gave this a shot before making an appointment with dermatologist.  </li>
      <li>If you like using hair gel, and don&#x27;t mind your hair left stiff and greasy, this would be a good thing.</li>
      <li>My hair was falling out at an alarming rate and now it has significantly slowed and my stylist has seen new growth.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t put it on all the time (kind of acted like a foam gel, which is not a good look for women...).</li>
      <li>Which is important because I wear a lot of blacks and dark grays for my job as an office manager at a funeral home.</li>
      <li>Moisturizes well, helped allay other Nioxin product, does something special for my hair.</li>
      <li>Since I am often stressed, it got to the point that most of my scalp was covered in scaly scabs and frequently bled from how hard I scratched.</li>
      <li>stops the itch for several hours , I  like that it has no smell , and it dries really fast.</li>
      <li>I went  through all natural and OTC remedies to no avail.</li>
      <li>because my wife frequently has her hair roots tinted, the dyes used cause scalp irritation and severe itching.</li>
      <li>It was amazing, I have no more scabs, a LOT less dandruff and</li>
      <li>Big flakes would come loose, very embarrassing.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m completely blown away and the amount I&#x27;m using is so tiny this bottle will last years.</li>
      <li>It helps calm itching, and a little goes a long way.</li>

<li> It helps calm itching, and a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> haven&#x27;t used this long enough or consistently enough to know what effect</li>
<li> I used it liberally and massaged it in and within less than a day, the red, sore spots were completely cleared up.</li>
<li> This feels really soothing and you can even put a small amount on without ruining your hairstyle.</li>
<li> Common lotion had about as much effect.</li>
<li> Product is for someone with dry, itchy scalp.</li>
<li> It is also a life saver in the winter when the air is dry and so is my skin.</li>
<li> I have seborrheic dermatitis that leaves my scalp so itchy and dry.</li>
<li> /&gt;really, after spending a small fortune on various shampoos and conditioners which didn&#x27;t work, it was such a relief to find this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> (There&#x27;s no way for me to post this without giving a star rating, and I don&#x27;t want to influence it one way or the other, so I&#x27;m putting it at 3 stars for now.)</li>
<li> The lotion gets absorbed by my scalp, and my hair does not get greasy or dirty looking as a result.&lt;br</li>
<li> The only negative thing I could say is the consistency.</li>
<li> This is a thick lotion, with the consistency similar to hand lotion, but a greasier feeling.</li>
<li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting such a thick product.</li>
<li> It was nearly impossible for me to go without full out scratching my scalp for a day</li>
<li> In less than two weeks, my scalp was clear.&lt;br</li>
<li> , I am black and get my hair relaxed.</li>
<li> scalp still gets a little itchy, but then I can just add the treatment and it helps a lot.</li>
<li> and I truly felt it was generally a waste of money.  </li>
<li> It also has the effect of firm hair gel.</li>
<li> I typically use Scalpactin combined with T-Sal to manage my seborrheic dermatitis flare-ups, but this most recent flare-up was especially bad and refused to go away, complete with itching, bleeding, and exceptionally bad dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I usually put a generous amount a few hours before shampooing, though, and massage it in all over, concentrating on any flareups.</li>
<li> My usual small patch of &amp;#34;winter dandruff&amp;#34; at the window&#x27;s peak would not clear up, in fact was getting worse.  </li>
<li> I purchased Nioxin for that purpose and it provided very little itch relief.  </li>
<li> no more bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
<li> So far, I haven&#x27;t seen anything abnormal or bad happen to my hair caused by this treatment.</li>
<li> A total disappointment for me.</li>
<li> This is a thick lotion.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really embarrassing and annoying.</li>
<li> The itchiness has really decreased and if I scratch my scalp, I DON&#x27;T get anything coming off under my nails</li>
<li> This made my hair weird.  </li>
<li> So I put it away as an expensive and failed test.  </li>
<li> Stop trying any expensive shampoo</li>
<li> also it takes away the dirty odor from oils on the scalp</li>
<li> I used everything, cold tax shampoo, T-gel, T tree shampoo, T tree oil, etc.</li>
<li> Even with this, I cannot say anything bad about it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I believe this product helps with my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, the only thing that works on my itchy scalp.</li>
    <li> This was almost expired when I received it, so I returned it.</li>
    <li> Really works and easy to use</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Works much more effective compared to the competitors&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I have scalp psoriasis.  I have prescription medicine but was looking for a non-steroidal treatment for itch.  I purchased Nioxin for that purpose and it provided very little itch relief.  So I put it away as an expensive and failed test.  But then I decided to give it a try for the red, sore areas and there, Nioxin scored a 5+. I used it liberally and massaged it in and within less than a day, the red, sore spots were completely cleared up. So buy it for the soothing part but try something else for itching.</li>
    <li> Great product,  really helps if you have itchy scalp. True to the manufacturer product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from dandruff all my life and have yet to find a product to control it. This product did calm the itchiness but did not help to control flakes. Still searching.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting such a thick product. Dries in clumps so have used overnight.</li>
    <li> For people fighting with severe dandruff and flaky scalp just by this product blindfolded . Within just a couple of days it showed me its power. Stop trying any expensive shampoo</li>
    <li> Wow!!!  My usual small patch of &amp;#34;winter dandruff&amp;#34; at the window&#x27;s peak would not clear up, in fact was getting worse.  I used everything, cold tax shampoo, T-gel, T tree shampoo, T tree oil, etc. And it would reappear after 12 hours.  Big flakes would come loose, very embarrassing.  I have a medical background and knew cause was most likely fungal, so I gave this a shot before making an appointment with dermatologist.  It took about 5 days of using several times a day, but it cleared up!  Smells fine, it didn&#x27;t make area look greasy.</li>
    <li> Worked as promised within one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My seborrheic dermatitis was uncontrollable this winter. I went  through all natural and OTC remedies to no avail. My dermatologist&#x27;s only answer is a tier four steroid. No thanks.&lt;br /&gt;This product relieved the itch and cleared the scalp. I will order this again.</li>
    <li> I have plaque psoriasis on my scalp, I have tried many many products from over the counter to prescriptions and this is the best product I have found to soothe the scalp and NOT make my hair look nasty and greasy</li>
    <li> stops the itch for several hours , I  like that it has no smell , and it dries really fast.</li>
    <li> I tried it but it didn&#x27;t do much for soothing just burned</li>
    <li> I have a sensitive scalp, not really dandruff.  Sometimes hair products really irritate me, but I won&#x27;t know until I try it.  Whenever I get a reaction this is the only thing that will make it go away.  It&#x27;s not greasy, it&#x27;s a gel-cream consistency and smells pretty good!  It is also a life saver in the winter when the air is dry and so is my skin.</li>
    <li> First off, the price shown here....just buy the full kit on this website and then it will be more worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I, for about six years, have had a super itchy scalp particularly when I&#x27;m stressed. Since I am often stressed, it got to the point that most of my scalp was covered in scaly scabs and frequently bled from how hard I scratched. It was nearly impossible for me to go without full out scratching my scalp for a day and so I never healed.&lt;br /&gt;My new hair stylist recommended the full scalp recovery system, but it is really the serum that does the trick. I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks and in the first two or three days of applying the serum, I had no more scabs. It was amazing, I have no more scabs, a LOT less dandruff and no more bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;My scalp still gets a little itchy, but then I can just add the treatment and it helps a lot. Can&#x27;t live without this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I am black and get my hair relaxed. So far, I haven&#x27;t seen anything abnormal or bad happen to my hair caused by this treatment.</li>
    <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis that leaves my scalp so itchy and dry. If I just run my fingers through my hair I get a shower of flakes. It&#x27;s really embarrassing and annoying. I used a prescription foam which works pretty well, but didn&#x27;t like that I couldn&#x27;t put it on all the time (kind of acted like a foam gel, which is not a good look for women...). This feels really soothing and you can even put a small amount on without ruining your hairstyle. I usually put a generous amount a few hours before shampooing, though, and massage it in all over, concentrating on any flareups. The itchiness has really decreased and if I scratch my scalp, I DON&#x27;T get anything coming off under my nails like I used to. Amazing. I&#x27;m using this in combination with the Nioxin step 4 shampoo and conditioner and the deep conditioner, and love the whole line.</li>
    <li> Like that it&#x27;s not a runny liquid.  Like that it works.  Wish it were more available on local shelves but happy that it&#x27;s available at all.</li>
    <li> relieved my itchy scalp in one use.  I had tried everything you can imagine and this is what worked....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;really, after spending a small fortune on various shampoos and conditioners which didn&#x27;t work, it was such a relief to find this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking about also using this to treat athlete&#x27;s foot (it&#x27;s got menthol in it and is very soothing)</li>
    <li> Excellent product, have been using for several weeks, have see and feel the difference on my scalp</li>
    <li> This seemed to do nothing for me and I truly felt it was generally a waste of money.  Common lotion had about as much effect.</li>
    <li> the bottle came with leaked product on one side</li>
    <li> It helps calm itching, and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It might be just me, but this product made my scalp itch even more.</li>
    <li> Product is for someone with dry, itchy scalp. My scalp is oily and itchy. Did nothing for itch, and though labeled that it is not to be washed or rinsed out, it leaves hair and scalp greasy, as if you had rubbed lotion into your scalp, so to use this product, you must wash your hair every day, unless you plan on staying home a lot, or covering your hair with scarves. A total disappointment for me. The seller, however, did well, shipping promptly.</li>
    <li> Good for other skin problems</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous potions and lotions - several at huge prices - from drugstores and dermatologists for a scaly spot on my noggin for years now &amp; nothing worked but this! In 2 days my scalp stopped itching and now I put a tiny drop on the formerly itchy scaly spot once a week. I&#x27;m completely blown away and the amount I&#x27;m using is so tiny this bottle will last years. It&#x27;s nice when something actually works.</li>
    <li> because my wife frequently has her hair roots tinted, the dyes used cause scalp irritation and severe itching. This product is the only solution which helps remove the itching.</li>
    <li> I have used the Nioxin System 1 for years and I love the results that I have been able to obtain.  My hair was falling out at an alarming rate and now it has significantly slowed and my stylist has seen new growth.  I did, however, find that my scalp was paying the price for my fabulous hair. It would get dry and flaky in a couple of areas and I discovered this serum while looking for a good deal on the System 1 shampoo. I decided to try it. The combination of the 4 steps keeps my hair itch- and flake-free. Which is important because I wear a lot of blacks and dark grays for my job as an office manager at a funeral home.</li>
    <li> Good just what I needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy that it came in a small size since I took it with me in my purse and applied it as needed throughout the day. After using the shampoo n conditioner and treatment as recommended the flakes are all gone.</li>
    <li> I love this. I typically use Scalpactin combined with T-Sal to manage my seborrheic dermatitis flare-ups, but this most recent flare-up was especially bad and refused to go away, complete with itching, bleeding, and exceptionally bad dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;I used Nioxin in combination with Mg217 Medicated Coal Tar Shampoo, and within 3 days the dandruff was reduced. In less than two weeks, my scalp was clear.&lt;br /&gt;The Nioxin is soothing upon contact, and helps reduce the itching throughout the day. The only negative thing I could say is the consistency. This is a thick lotion. For someone used to the liquid Scalpactin, there was a learning curve. Even with this, I cannot say anything bad about it. The lotion gets absorbed by my scalp, and my hair does not get greasy or dirty looking as a result.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended if you have seborrheic dermatitis!</li>
    <li> This is a thick lotion, with the consistency similar to hand lotion, but a greasier feeling. It also has the effect of firm hair gel. If you like using hair gel, and don&#x27;t mind your hair left stiff and greasy, this would be a good thing. But if you&#x27;re hoping for more of a liquid, or something that won&#x27;t affect the appearance or feel of your hair, this isn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used this long enough or consistently enough to know what effect, if any, it has on my dandruff. I doubt I&#x27;ll use it often enough to find out, but if I do, I&#x27;ll update the review. I just wanted to share the info about the product&#x27;s consistency, since I would have like to know that. (There&#x27;s no way for me to post this without giving a star rating, and I don&#x27;t want to influence it one way or the other, so I&#x27;m putting it at 3 stars for now.)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and the transaction was smooth and fast.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the actual stuff.  For starters it was opened.  It looked like someone had rinsed the bottle out and filled it.  I have used the stuff purchased from a store, and it worked.  This made my hair weird.  I believe I was bamboozled.</li>
    <li> works wonderfully to get rid of the flaky dermatitis on the scalp...also it takes away the dirty odor from oils on the scalp</li>
    <li> Moisturizes well, helped allay other Nioxin product, does something special for my hair.</li>
    <li> Works exceptionally well.  I have tried many different anti-dandruff products and this is definitely best I have used.</li>
</ol>
