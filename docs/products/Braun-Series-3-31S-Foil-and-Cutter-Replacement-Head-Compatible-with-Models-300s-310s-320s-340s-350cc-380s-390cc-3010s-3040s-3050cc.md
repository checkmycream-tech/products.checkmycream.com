<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These work great with my 5000 series and have had no issues.  The design has been updated and shaving time is cut down and it seems even closer than olders style replacment foil and cutter.</li>
    <li> My husband Richard, is quite pleased with the Braun Series 3 Combi 31s Foil &amp; Cutter replacement.  Much better now that he doesn&#x27;t have to keep going over and over his face trying to get those whiskers.  I like it too, no more stubble.</li>
    <li> Did the job it was intended for.</li>
    <li> Poorly crafted at the factory.  Left metallic marks on the face and flimsy.  Shave not satisfactory either.  Time to look for another brand of electric razor so I won&#x27;t need to get these poorly made replacements.</li>
    <li> Shaver feels like new now!</li>
    <li> Been using it ever since I bought it and it is very good, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Foil tore right away.</li>
    <li> Did not come remotely close to fitting my 350cc even though the model was listed by the vendor. Shipped from Asia, took an age to arrive, and now I&#x27;m stuck with it.  I am not a happy camper.  I think this is Braun&#x27;s fault as much as anyone&#x27;s, they have a bazillion + 1 models. I had a Panasonic before and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to buy again.</li>
    <li> As expected fits and works good</li>
    <li> This replacement is as advertised.  Easy to assemble.  Once again, I can get those hard to shave hairs like on the neck.</li>
    <li> Not much to say.  Snap in the new set and start shaving.  This restores the razor to like-new operation since all the parts that weat are replaced.  Note - the only difference between the 31S and 31B is the colour - silver or black, so take whichever one is cheaper, faster delivery or easier to get.</li>
    <li> completly satisfied with this purchase......but just discovered....when purchasing it stated the price is in canadian dollars....when I received my mastercard charge they charged me an exchange rate to convert to american dollars...therfore the total purchase charge was some what more than the price I expected to pay..I don&#x27;t understand this?</li>
    <li> I have used my Braun shaver for years and have replaced the foil and cutter four time or more.  This new combo is great.</li>
    <li> My old foil had a mall break and it would cut my face when I used the razor. These are difficult to find locally as the razor is over 5 years old.  Buying this way is economical and convenient.</li>
    <li> Delivery from Amazon was quick; I was pleased to note that Braun still makes replacement the cutter and foil for my 10 year old razor!</li>
    <li> So easy, affordable and extends the life of the razor</li>
    <li> These cutters are high quality from Braun. They replace easily. The razor acts like it brand new again. I would recommend amazon for the purchase. They were the least expensive</li>
    <li> A great blade, it takes a while to become dull and is easy to replace on the razor. Does its job and gets the hair off my face!</li>
    <li> This was definitely a must buy. Fit my electric razor and continue to buy until I need a new razor.</li>
    <li> The old style was better and last longer, easier to clean. The blades seem to fit loose adding to the noise</li>
    <li> PERFECT. And cheaper, including next day delivery, than WalMart!!</li>
    <li> The 31S Series 3 does not fit the Braun 370cc model even though Amazon&#x27;s product description says it does.</li>
    <li> I did not know how bad my old cutting head needed to be replaced till I replaced them with this foil and cutter block. It is like having a new shaver again.  Product is of good quality and I will buy another in 18 months.</li>
    <li> on my 5300 works great. shaves like new again after cutter went dull. amazon is one of the only places I can find this anymore</li>
    <li> IVE BOUGHT THESE FROM AMAZON IN THE PAST TO REVITALIZE MY 15 YEAR OLD SHAVER.  THEY ARE GETTING HARDER TO FIND BUT THE OLD SHAVER IS BETTER THAN THE NEW ONES AND THE NEW HEADS KEEP IT PLUGGING ALONG.  THEY WORK GREAT AND ACTUALLY LAST A YEAR BEFORE HAVING TO SWITCH THEM OUT FOR NEW.</li>
    <li> Once again...buying replacement foils and cutters online for Braun products is not easy - or straight forward.    I needed a 30B and I received a 30S.  Cutter fit perfectly, the foil was way off.    Amazon was gracious and gave me a full refund for the puchase, including freight....so CUDOS TO AMAZON.COM!!!    Hopefully Braun will get out of the \\&quot;HP mode\\&quot; of product design and changing the foils so they are too model specific - they have it right with the cutter.    Braun is a great product I have used for over 35 years...I am glad I don&#x27;t need to replace the foil and cutter and more often than every 18-months.  :o)</li>
    <li> The foil and cutter fit my older model 5614.  The shave was noticeably better after installing the new set.  I have replaced the heads 3 times with this shaver and all have performed well.  If you notice pulling when you shave it is likely due to dull blades.  You can extend their use a bit by putting a little oil on them occasionally and/or cleaning them with the spray sold by Remington.  Nothing can make them last forever, so a new head/cutter is needed every 12/18 months depending upon your beard and skin.  I use a pre-shave and it makes the head glide over the skin much more easily and comfortably.    These name brand replacement packs are recommended for your Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> This is a great replacement foil and cutter block for the Braun 5 series - it&#x27;s better than the original parts which came with my old 5614 and the replacements which they used to sell for those parts.  Durability is another issue, however, which is why I marked the rating down to 4 stars.  The old foil and cutter block replacements would last as long as you could stand them.  These seem to be good for about 6 months, max., with daily use.  That&#x27;s not an unreasonable cost as compared to a conventional razor blade and shaving supplies over the same period, especially since I&#x27;ve had my 5614 for about 10 years, so the original cost of the unit has virtually disappeared from the cost equation.  Granted, however, that you should replace the cutter block regularly to maintain a good shave, perhaps I&#x27;m too critical of the durability of these redesigned parts.</li>
    <li> These replacement blades are hard to find in your local stores but they are easily found on Amazon and alot cheeper too!</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced and original</li>
    <li> Great product.  Worked and fit as described.</li>
    <li> Good price, actual/original product. Better price than store-bought, including delivery cost.</li>
    <li> This foil/cutter block combo did not fit snug on my shaver from the very begining.  I was still able to use the shaver and hence I decided to put up with some incovenience. However, after a few days it just would not stay on the shaver. I contacted NationalDealz.com, who is  the vendor through whom I received this product. They are refusing to send a replacement because I did not save the original package! I feel, this is a very poor reflection on Amazon&#x27;s stellar record of customer satisfaction. Amazon would be better off not having NationalDealz.com as their vendor. I certainly would not buy any product in future which is being delivered through NationalDealz.com[[ASIN:B001VEK1KI Braun Series 3 Combi 31S Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 5000/6000)]]</li>
    <li> It is so much nicer to shave now with sharper cleaner blades.  Just what the doctor ordered.</li>
    <li> Fantastic value!! This replacement head makes my old razor run like new! The foil is shaped differently than my last replacement foil but once I got used to it there is no difference! Thanks, Amazon.</li>
    <li> I get a replacement head for my 8 year old electric shaver every 14 months.  Cuts like the first day I used it almost a decade ago!</li>
    <li> Perfect for the cheap dude I am, who will not replace his old razor that just refuses to die.  Remove old screen and cutter, install new screen and cutter.  The toughest part is getting the new stuff out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might be pleasantly surprised how well your razor is SUPPOSED to work.</li>
    <li> Several others have mentioned this, so obviously no one at Amazon reads these or takes action when buyers return this item. Braun should get most of the blame for calling this \\&quot;series 3.\\&quot; I have a 390cc with the words \\&quot;Series 3\\&quot; stamped right on the razor. I&#x27;m normally a big fan of Amazon, but not today.</li>
    <li> This fit as a perfect replacement for my shaver!</li>
    <li> I am very well pleased with my purchase of this electric razor replacement screen and blades.  The purchase process was quick and easy; the shipment was quick, and the product is exactly what I needed.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent replacement product for Braun razors.  I would reorder this anytime because it works w/o complaint an</li>
    <li> Braun series 3 very good , good price.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised, delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting this product at Walmart or Target for years, but can no longer get it locally. It&#x27;s a shame because I prefer to buy locally, but have no quams about buying through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Easy transaction.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> My Braun is getting long in the tooth but this new cutter replacement made it like new. Easy to switch out the old for the new.</li>
    <li> Well you know how it is when most people wait until they are ready to replace the cutter/screen on their shaver so I decided to get one every six months with automatic shipment so I know when to change the screen/cutter and I don&#x27;t have to shop around for one at the last minute.</li>
    <li> It does what it should do.</li>
    <li> I was a bit worried that it would&#x27;nt have been the correct product for my razor but it turned out to be just the part i needed.</li>
    <li> The product I bought is good.   But your Review procedure is too complicated. I don&#x27;t know if I will do it again.</li>
    <li> Since there are mixed reviews on this replacement pack (31S), I initially bought only one pack to see if it would fit my Braun model 5770 shaver.  I later bought another pack for my second Braun shaver (also model 5770).</li>
    <li> Is not easy find this accessory in the market, but Bingo, I have a solution...!!! :) , life is more easy, or not? Great service, thanks you guys...!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to install. Makes shaver like new again. Prompt delivery was appreciated. Photos in the ad made it easier to get correct model replacement.  Amazon made purchasing easy.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 3 Combination 31S Foil and Cutter Replacement pack works with my Braun Series 3, 370. It is type 5737.     I first checked the parts with the Braun site to make sure it would fit.  The replacement package comes with instructions. It is simply to take out the old cutter and put in the new cutter and foil; just takes seconds.    I get much better cutting action now with the cutter and foil combination. I have had my Braun Series 3, 370 electric razor over a year and a half. .     The reason I bought this combination replacement was that my foil broke open exposing the blades. Now it shaves much easier, quicker; like new.</li>
    <li> Not sure why these are so high priced.  They work good, but man they cost too much.  I&#x27;m just glad that Amazon had it because Walmart didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and product was received within a week, excellent seller!  Product itself seems a little \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; than I&#x27;d expect from Braun, there wasn&#x27;t much difference between my old blade it replaced and the new one in cutting ability.</li>
    <li> Should have purchased this a few years ago.  Made the saver like new.  Can recommend it for those of use that use this razor.</li>
    <li> I want say that the serives and price was great. I had I belive with three to four days. I will be getting a new pack by the end of the&lt;br /&gt;year to have on hand, when needed.&lt;br /&gt;James V.</li>
    <li> Good fit and close shave.</li>
    <li> This replacement kit worked fine. After extended use the old blade began to pull at whiskers leaving my face irritated. The foil had a small hole. This replacement kit did the trick. My 370 washable is perfectly adequate razor. I do think the high end model may be a little smoother but it&#x27;s expensive from the get-go and the replacement cleaning fluid is a scam.     For those complaining about the closeness of an electric shave a few pointers: Electric shaving is done DRY. Shave before you shower-not right after. Don&#x27;t pull it across you face quickly-go slow and let it work. Move against the grain, from bottom to top, from the sides in and you&#x27;ll get a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> Cant go wrong with these</li>
    <li> delivery was quick and price was excellent!!!</li>
    <li> This foil and replacement pack is the same as what you could find at the big box stores, but it is more convenient and cheaper here on Amazon. Like most other users, I have not found such packs to be up to the quality level of the original equipment. But I&#x27;ve grown attached to my old shaver and I am content to order these replacements for it once a year.</li>
    <li> I used to swear by Braun electric razors.  My most recent, a top of the line of the 5000 series, was wonderful when I got it.  The first replacement blade/foil set was also wonderful.  But the last set was awful, and the set I just got is even worse.  I replaced a year old blade/foil set, and the new set is actually WORSE than the year old set.  I think Braun downgraded components in their replacement head sets, and someone there should think about this very carefully... The result is NOT that I decide to go buy a new Braun, hoping it&#x27;ll be better.  The result is that have just bought a Panasonic to replace it, having bought a Panasonic two years ago to replace a Braun that had been my travel razor... and the Panasonic shaves better, even two years later (I travel about half the time, so the Braun and Panasonic get equal numbers of days of use) where after a year, the Braun&#x27;s yanking and pulling and dull.    Basically, the poor quality and performance of the replacement kit motivated me to dump the Braun.  Selling me a razor with one set of characteristics that you then don&#x27;t sell in the replacements is just another form of bait and switch.</li>
    <li> Works with my older model 5610.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly on my Contour 5895. Now it works like a brand new one.</li>
    <li> Fits as it should, since it is the original brand. Even though this is an older shaver now, for me this was far better money spent than starting all over.</li>
    <li> why didn&#x27;t i replace this sooner? arrived quickly, shortened my shave time by 2/3. the braun 5810 razor still works and recharges like a champ. thanks</li>
    <li> have already done this</li>
    <li> First off, I wish they would provide the foil head separately from the cutter for a lot less $, as this is the piece that wears out before the cutter.  Secondly, the foil head replacement is not a perfect fit, like they made in the past.  The head used to pop off when you pressed the button.  Now, you have to pry it off after pressing the button.</li>
    <li> This foil and cutter and cleaning with a brush brings your old Braun shaver back to good as new.  A great price for a great product.</li>
    <li> The item was as described and I had no problem with it fitting on my old Braun 5614.  Brought my razor back to life</li>
    <li> If you have a 390CC  DO NOT BUY THIS    It does not fit. If you have any of the newer Series 3 shavers it will not fit. This is for the OLD Series 3.</li>
    <li> Easy to change out in just a few seconds and your good for another year or so.  Typical Braun quality.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my dad from Amazon due to the price &amp; great service. My dad  has yet to encounter issues with t he product.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Although the product review specifically said that it worked with Braun 5710 model, it only half way did. The cutter fit the slot okay but the foil was the wrong size(to small). I also can&#x27;t say that the shave is any smoother or closer than with the old cutter, so this was a waste of money for Model #5710 Braun. I would not have bought this in the first place if the product review had not said it worked with my model, so this is basically false advertising.</li>
    <li> I wish that the description was more descriptive as to what models this worked with. I have a 5000 series razor and this being a Series 3 replacement made things a bit questionable in the stores, of course when I didn&#x27;t have my reading glasses with me which is most of the time! Of course by the time I&#x27;d get home I would have forgotten what I wanted to look up on the Internet as well. The type on the package is very small so if you&#x27;re in the store make sure you can see tiny print or just look up the replacement series on the Internet. Amazon was cheaper than my local Walmart for this item as well and I bundled this for free shipping as well!</li>
    <li> the cutter works but the screen does not fit the model I have is 8975 I tried to fit it and is does not work the wrong screen</li>
    <li> Factory packed  replacements on-time or early.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> It fit perfectly well into my 3-year old 5000 series shaver. It looks a little different, but it&#x27;s still nice. Very smooth on the skin compared to my old foil (may have just been worn out). The cutter is exactly the same.</li>
    <li> Love Braun shavers. And that you can find quality replacement parts forever, even on very old models. This one is an other good example.</li>
    <li> I actually wore out the foil of my older(&gt;10 years) Braun shaver and finally replaced the original foil and cutters. The new foil and cutters work, but the new foil seems thicker, with holes rather than slots, and is no better than the one I replaced (well, no better than it was before it wore through).</li>
    <li> Received my order fast and the price was the cheapest I&#x27;d seen.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Good price and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you need for a 5614</li>
    <li> These replacement blades work fine in my older model 5612 Braun electric shaver.  I do not know if they will work in other models.</li>
    <li> using Bruan for yrs.used Amazon again  &amp; price was great for a cuter that cuts very close and btw last about 6mos. using every day.Foil undamaged because Amazon packaged product right. Zero hassels and face feeling good !!!</li>
    <li> Could not believe I found the shaver head on Amazon.  Had looked several places trying to find it.  Ordered the replacement pack and it arrived promptly and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have an old version of Braun Series 3 and been looking for a replacement cutter in Target, Walmart, etc. Out of luck, they don&#x27;t carry it anymore. I searched Amazon and was able to find the right replacement pack for much less price. The cutter feels smoother than the original one and works well. Happy to search on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The replacement blades fit perfectly and what a difference in the shave over the old blades.  I should have replaced them sooner.</li>
    <li> got product and totally was no where close to describtion. was listed as to fit a braun 370cc shaver and is far from that completly dissatisfied</li>
    <li> It works just like the original and although that&#x27;s not the best of the best, this particular product serves its function as well as it could.</li>
    <li> It fits and cuts closer than the old dull blade (I had it for &gt; 18 months)  Much cheaper than other replacement cutter/foils    The only question I can&#x27;t answer is does this blade dull faster than older Braun replacement cutter blocks?  I&#x27;ll tell you in 15 months</li>
    <li> Been using this model for many years. Every once in a while I replace the cutter and foil. They last a long time... longer than I expect. My life&#x27;s partner likes how close a shave I get from it.</li>
    <li> works great.  I&#x27;m not sure how old my shaver is, but everything is good.</li>
    <li> This is the third Braun foil and cutter I have purchased, and each one was perfect!</li>
    <li> extend the life of you shaver with a new blade and foil. As long as your battery is strong enough for a full shave this brings it back to factory new.</li>
    <li> I really like my replacement shaver head!  It gives me a nice clean cut when I shave my face.  The silver shaver head goes well with my black electric shaver, it gives it \\&quot;barber-style look to it.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement!!!</li>
    <li> It was the wronmg blade, my fault, I was confused with which one to order, they came from Korea, so I will not be sending them back, my loss..no worries</li>
    <li> Hard to find product at a fair price.</li>
    <li> took a chance hoping these screens would fit on my much older model Braun razor that wasn&#x27;t listed as compatible...they fit!</li>
    <li> Although I ordered this item through Amazon.com&#x27;s Marketplace it iod not show up despite it having tracking so...I&#x27;m reviewing what I recall of these blades that cost a fortune at London Drugs up here in Canada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re what you use with my shaver--&#x27;nuf said. they work fine. The foil cover is a pain as over time it&#x27;ll get a chunk knocked out of it and you&#x27;re stuck having to buy a new foil and blades. I have no idea why these things are so expensive as they are probably mass produced and require very few materials. Honestly, they should be around $10 max.</li>
    <li> I like it, saves me a ton because I was about to buy a new shaver all together. But this new head and blades really improved the shave u got before.</li>
    <li> I have always like Braun they work well and last forever, by replacing the Foil and cutter every year or so.</li>
    <li> Fits my Contour 5790 shaver.  I&#x27;ve had the shaver for about 2.5 years and this is the first time I&#x27;m replacing the foil and cutter.  It must have been long overdue.  I forgot how well this shaver worked when it was new.  I was shocked when I put the new head on.  Glides across my face and cuts my shaving time in half.</li>
    <li> I paid 25.00 for this foil and cutter pack. It was totally worth the money. After replacing my foil and cutter my shaver no longer pulls my hair and cuts quickly and cleanly. Make sure you do some research to make sure you are buying the right type for your razor. Braun seems to have renamed some models over the years so it can get confusing!</li>
    <li> Performs as promised.  Recommended</li>
    <li> I have a 15 year old Braun razor and I found it hard to believe that the this combo kit was still available and for a good price.</li>
    <li> It tightly fits the shaver. When I push the release button, it does not release the net like my original one. I does not even shave, I cannot use this for my shaver.</li>
    <li> It arrived in perfect condition, and worked just as well!</li>
    <li> I could not find this part in any store. It was exactly the part I needed and it was a great buying experience and the price was 10.00 less than at any store if they had the right part. Excellent 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted but could not find in stores. It was packed small enough where the postman could fit it in my mail box and not be stolen. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Good value, arrived on time, would buy again.</li>
    <li> Makes the shaver operate like new!</li>
    <li> It was very easy to replace the old foil and blades with the new ones.  So far they have returned the shaver to \\&quot;like new\\&quot; condition.</li>
    <li> This shaving head is very smooth on the skin and glides effortlessly around all areas of the face. Best of all, it gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> Replacement head fits and worjks</li>
    <li> This was replacement head &amp; foil for a Braun electric razor&lt;br /&gt;Works great.  This replacement was also a Braun product</li>
    <li> Good replacement part. Good price here on Amazon, compared to the local stores.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say it is better than the original cutter and foil when they were new, but it was about time I changed the original foil and cutter, and this new one works well so far.&lt;br /&gt;Note: this new one is silver, not black like the original, but I don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;Also notice the pattern differences (see images I uploaded) in the foil and cutter.&lt;br /&gt;Click Yes, if you found the images useful.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks :)</li>
    <li> The Braun cutting head and foil replacement foil were just what I needed to refurbish  the razor my son uses. It is a perfect match and works great. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This part does not work with the razors it says it does.  Consult the Braun site.  Returned to Amazon.</li>
    <li> It is what it is..  a replacement part for a great shaver.  buy it if you need it, and don&#x27;t leave your house.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews for non-electric razor-blade replacements where people have commented that they are not as sharp as ones they have bought in an actual store. I found that to be the case with these blades as well. Are these sharper than my old dull ones? Yeah. But I remember getting new blades being super awesome cause they cut so well and so easy. I still feel like these are my old ones, I just dont have to push as hard as with my dull ones. Overall, buying these blades made me wish I would have put the money towards getting a new razor or just bought some in a store.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and has work for the last couple months. The price is great compared to many other stores I checked.</li>
    <li> I would purchase these blades again.  I replace the blades on my shaver approximately twice per year and I always go with the ones that are the best price.  It&#x27;s becoming harder to find blades for these series of shavers, so you might consider getting some now.</li>
    <li> Husband was very happy to get a replacement head for his shaver.  Target or wal-mart didn&#x27;t carry his peticular model.  His is an older model.  He was a very happy camper!!!</li>
    <li> Good replacement that works.  Bought for my father who loves his Braun.</li>
    <li> I gave it a 4 star rating only because the price could be lower. I&#x27;ve had this razor for many years  &amp; the replacement foil &amp; cutter usualy lasts between one year and one &amp; half years. The cutter gives a fairly good shave for me. I would recommend this to anyone based on buying a new razor is very costly compared to buying this replacement pack.</li>
    <li> Fast  shipped  works  great .</li>
    <li> Tried another site I had used in the past and I think they are getting out of the parts business. My son-in-law suggest I go to Amazon and it proved very easy to identify the parts needed, the cost was reasonable, and the product was received in two days! Good job!</li>
    <li> Fits my braun shaver fine.</li>
    <li> Renews my shaver, just like new.</li>
    <li> Installed foil and cutter, now shaver works great.  I ordered from Amazon because this item is not available locally.  I received the product as promised. I was impressed with shaving results and ordered two additional replacement packs just to be on the safe side.  although the web-site indicates the product is imported from China, the packaging states product was manufactured in Germany.</li>
    <li> Obviously I have a 390cc, I do not know what you people who say it does not fit the 390cc are talking about. It fit mine just fine, as it should. It says on the back of the shaver what pack to use, which is the 31s. The product itself came in two days, like I requested, with the foil and cutter. I then proceeded to shave my face, the new blades and foil cut closer to my face then the ones I replaced, so they did their job.</li>
    <li> replacement foil and screen made shaving a pleasure again..nice and close and smooth shaving worth the replacement to make the razor like new</li>
    <li> This replacement foil+cutter fits perfectly on an old 3xxx Braun shaver. The replacement is silver, instead of the dark colored one that it replaced.  The blades are different too, but they also made the shaver operate slightly quieter; I like it!</li>
    <li> Easy to install. Does the job. Need to change when cutting edge feels smooth and looks shiny.</li>
    <li> I have the Braun Series 3 Model 370 and this replacement fit my unit. Some seem to have been confused about Braun&#x27;s product replacement charts and trying to figure out what fits. Its not that complicated folks and when in doubt, look at your actual unit. On the back of mine is clearly says &amp;#34;Use Parts 31S&amp;#34;. Simple enough. The great thing about replacing the cutter head is that you benefit from any design changes and improvements. This is the second time I have replaced the cutter head, and it is better than the last, giving a faster cut than before, and not just because it is new, but the design is different. This is still not the closest shave, but it is the most portable of the decent razors around.</li>
    <li> Works great and fits my old Braun shaver like a charm.  It&#x27;s not 5 star because the price is constantly changing and you have to wait and watch it for a few days to get to the price you know it will eventually sell for.</li>
    <li> A new foil and cutter make a 10-year old shaver cut line new!  These items, like all others, must be replaced every so often.</li>
    <li> I was not satisfied at all with what I bought.  It was damaged and I will not be able to use the screen but will be able to use the cutters only.</li>
    <li> I needed a new screen for my razor.  I was able to find a very good deal on Amazon from a company in Tennesee, which saved me several dollors.  The shipping was reasonable and the product arrived in a short time.</li>
    <li> This item does not fit a 5790 shaver.  Why does it come up for a search formerly 5000/6000 shavers it is a lie.  so I spent 22 dollars on a worthless parts and the cutter ruined my foil so I have to buy new parts.</li>
    <li> This replacement parts package was comparatively reasonably priced and works as expected.  It is sturdy, sharp, and may prove to be as long lasting as the original.  If not, I will let you know.  Bgh</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price of these Braun Series 3 Foil and cutter replacement pack. They are a steal compared to buying them in a brick and motor.</li>
    <li> This item fits my 5000 series Braun contour shaver fine. The foil has a slightly different design to it but seems to work just fine. I could definitely tell a big difference between the old and the new blades.  The package states it was made in Germany.  Only problem I had was the SLOW shipping...it weighs less than 2 ounces and therefore could have been mailed first class with a delivery confirmation and been here within 2-3 days instead of 8 plus days...just doesn&#x27;t make much sense to me. I will update this review after using it for awhile.</li>
    <li> Replacement cutter and foil, arrived in excellent condition. Nice price for Braun.</li>
    <li> This works great for my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to fault Braun as a company by making it so freakin hard to get the right replacement foil.  You need to know the model number and type to get the right one.  How about just using 3 different model numbers like 5775, 5776, and 5777, for the 3 different types of 5775 razors Braun CS says they have.</li>
    <li> worked great on my old electric razor.</li>
    <li> Made my shaver just like new!</li>
    <li> I expected a better shave than my previous foil and cutter - not as good as previous which I had used for a number of years.</li>
    <li> I have been a Braun shaver user for over 10 years, and I would not supplement it for the use of any other shaver because of the quality service it provides. The Braun Shaver will make your face feel as if hair had never their before, and besides I like the youthful look that I get. I would sell this product with a money back guaranteed. Amazon delivered with  speedy service that was needed, thank you Amazon.com</li>
    <li> Excellent product. This foil and cutter made my razor as good as new. I didn&#x27;t realize how bad my old set was.</li>
    <li> Great quality and works good</li>
    <li> Good replacement blades / shear heads that fit my old trusty Braun Contour 5790 Razor perfectly. The Original head / blade lasted me many years and I&#x27;m sure these will do the same.</li>
    <li> I was satisfied with my purchase of the Braun series 3 Foil and Cutter replacement pack.  Although I only needed a new foil, it&#x27;s probably best to have a new cutter as well.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly on my 5790 electric razor. There is nothing much more to say, but it tells me I need to write more, so doing so.</li>
    <li> I received this item  in one week after ordered. So far so good. My Braun shave works like new after replaced this order.</li>
    <li> These are exactly what was advertised. The price was right. These have to be replaced on a regular basis anyway so it was good to find the ones I needed and saved some money.</li>
    <li> The new design of foil screen and cutter pulls on the whiskers periodically, especially if the rechargeable shaver isn&#x27;t fully charged.  My old foil never did that.</li>
    <li> Second time purchasing this and it&#x27;s a sound value with great turnaround. My face thanks you as does my wallet.</li>
    <li> Nice foils for a great shaver.</li>
    <li> i wouldnt buy another braun again, if your looking for a great foil shaver that gets super close i honestly suggest you look into the WAHL 5star supershaver.&lt;br /&gt;cuts very close and puts a braun shaver to shame. i used braun until i bought my wahl and now im stuck, i would recommend the wahl to anyone!!</li>
    <li> Actually my husband likes it and am happy to be able to order parts instead of throwing the razor away and buying a new one.</li>
    <li> This works great and now I can shave in half the time as before with the old dull blades</li>
    <li> This fit my model 5790 just very tight so as the ejection button doesn&#x27;t work.  I have to pull it off to clean razor.  Otherwise seems to be okay.</li>
    <li> I thought I was going to have to buy a whole new shaver when my foil head tore.  I was really happy to find this instead.  Replacing the parts was easy and fast.  Shaver is good as new!</li>
    <li> It is good to know that these machines are made to last and that replacement parts of available. Always buy Braun.</li>
    <li> Item in new condition and was perfect replacement.</li>
    <li> As a grown man who has absolutely no need for traditional razors due to my childlike appearance, this product is perfect for my nearly decade old electric Braun razor. Now I will gladly enjoy another decade of shaving once every 2 weeks to remove the peach fuzz I can only hope will one day reach it&#x27;s full potential as a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. I am 29.</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as posted. No complaints!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy that this is still available.  Very high quality.</li>
    <li> Found these replacement parts so can keep using electric razor that we like so well.  Haven&#x27;t found a replacement razor that we like, so being able to buy the foil and cutter replacement for the Braun razor we have, works well.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Work great for close shave.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like having a brand new shaver, but it&#x27;s actually 8 years old.  The battery is not holding a charge for more than a weeks worth of shaves, but with a new foil and cutter I don&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as advertised and works perfectly with my razor. Price was fair. Makes keeping the razor up to date easy.</li>
    <li> I noticed a big difference as soon as I popped in these replacement parts. My shave was much quicker and smoother. The parts fit perfectly and I have had no problems or issues at all. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to replace their foil and cutter.</li>
    <li> less expensive than K-Mart. Kinda tricky to assemble it but i am a man who does not give up, now YOU STILL ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING ME MY THE CULT CD. ANY HELP WILL BE APPRECIATED TY Greg.</li>
    <li> The improvement to my close shaving ability with this replacement cutter was exceptional. I&#x27;m now getting the close shave I expect from my Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> These cutters work great even better if you use the oil for lubrication I will look into buying from Amazon in the future</li>
    <li> It was hard finding this particular sized replacement pack and we were so pleased when we found it on Amazon.com. As his old razor had been performing badly, my husband was very pleased after he put the new replacement in and now has a clean shave.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time, was priced low and I am very pleased. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad to know I didn&#x27;t have to pay $85 or more to get a new shaver. Mine is pretty old, but this replacement foil works better than the original.</li>
    <li> The cutters have an average life of 6-7 months. I usually shave every other day. Sometimes I think that there are better shavers and cutters in the market superior than Braun, yet I am reasonably happy. I must say though that I have some resilient hairs and I always finish my shaving using old-fashioned blades without foam and just water.  As a friend of mine said that having a beard is worse than shaving it.</li>
    <li> My Braun Shaver now works like new with an unexpected benefit of staying charged longer with use, I expect as a result of the reduced friction on the new parts.</li>
    <li> I usually buy this product at the local store but they always out of stock and a little more expensive.  This does the job.</li>
    <li> I buy this every 15 - 18 months for my Braun 5723 and they work fine. Quality seems as good as original. Price has dropped recently which is good. Never use wet, only dry.</li>
    <li> The replacement blade and foil is easy to put in, but I was expecting some kind of dramatic increase in it&#x27;s ability to give a clean shave, and it wasn&#x27;t that big a difference</li>
    <li> the part was as described and my razor works fine.  Thanks for the fast service.</li>
    <li> Local SuperTarget was out, went online. Was surprised when I &amp;#34;checked out&amp;#34; that my Discover card bonus paid for it.</li>
    <li> After trying other manufacturer&#x27;s products Braun is number 1 with me after over 15 years of use. I recommend the Braun product to everyone when it comes to a consumer product.</li>
    <li> I received BRAIN series3 . Very satisfied. No need to send me again. I will order again when I will need Thais product again thanks</li>
    <li> exact item as needed -  will order again</li>
    <li> Sharp, as expected from Braun.</li>
    <li> You have to replace them every 12-18 months if you want a good shave.  That is, if you shave with this everyday like I do.  Makes the razor seem all brand new again, every time you replace the foil / cutter combination.  Well worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;I replaced my first foil on this shaver after 26 months of use.  Was still shaving alright but not efficiently.  Should have thrown out the foil / cutter sooner.</li>
    <li> appreciate ,fast  delivery</li>
    <li> He enjoys using the Braun Shaver and its acesories.</li>
    <li> Right item delivered promptly</li>
    <li> The new blade design is terrible.  This is my fourth or fifth replacement blade for my Contour razor and this is by far the WORST blade design I&#x27;ve seen from Braun.  If you are used to the old blades that actually cut facial hair, then DO NOT BUY this blade!  It took me twice as long to shave last night as it did with my old blunt blade.  I actually pulled my old blade out of the trash and used it half way through shaving because I was getting nowhere with the new one.  I&#x27;m very disappointed and feel I&#x27;ve wasted my money on the new blade.</li>
    <li> Replacing the foil and cutter every 18 months is expensive in Canada. You can drop up to $75 every time from retail. But getting the same thing off Amazon, saves you money to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as Braun is concerned, the craftmanship is suffering. The new foil and cutter are heavier in gauge making a close shave impossible, or at least not as good as the one I replaced. By manufacturing a &amp;#34;one-size-fits-all&amp;#34; foil and cutter, some of the older models don&#x27;t shave as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, it works and until I replace my shaver, which I&#x27;ve had for over 10 years, it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> Seconds to install, now getting a better shave as I had never replaced them before.  I should have replaced sooner.</li>
    <li> Item as described, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This product was a perfect fit and works great. Delivery was when promised.</li>
    <li> The cutters are nice, they are very effective at cutting or trimming hair.  Braun is a brand I consider synonyms to quality. The shaver I have has lasted over 10 years. Replace the cutters every once in awhile and it is like a new shaver. Less expensive than buying disposables and less sucky than shaving for real.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my husband, he has a rather old Braun shaver.  The item came in the package as shown.  It fit the razor as specified.  It works great!</li>
    <li> Did what I needed it to do. Would recommend to anyone needing a Braun shaver such as the one purchased.</li>
    <li> I ended up having to return the Braun Series 3 370 Men&#x27;s Shaver because I got a much better shave from my Gillette sensor double blade. so I DID NOT use the Braun Series 3 Combi 31S Foil and Cutter Replacement Pack (Formerly 5000/6000. I returned it.</li>
    <li> Product does refresh shaving experience, especially if you are experiencing a lot of \\&quot;pulling\\&quot;...However a week after I received this I saw it at my local Target store for $25.....so go figure.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Arrived quickly-sooner than estimated.</li>
    <li> Works good, but a bit too expensive.</li>
    <li> It is as described and delivered on time.  Made my Braun shaver good as new.</li>
    <li> Works great on my husband&#x27;s Braun 5610 shaver - easy to install. Be sure to check your model number and order the correct series.  This part is for the 5000/ 6000 series shavers.  Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Everything was great!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Braun Series 5000 for many years, and these replacement pacts are great for extending the life of the shaver.</li>
    <li> definite need . Its like a tune-up for the razor.  Not on a schedule yet but realized that this is required with all of the use. recommend to all who use.</li>
    <li> The screen is the same as the factory oiece, but the blades are not really &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34;. The cutter unit has flat bands instead of real blades. It works better than a dull cutter, but is not the same as the Braun stuff.</li>
    <li> I forgot how close the razor would shave me until I realized how old the foil and cutter were and replaced them.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 sets and they work just fine.  I get tired of these reviews (writing them)  I will stop purchasing from Amazon if I have to continue writing reviews.</li>
    <li> For a new product, the blade cartridge was not as sharp or effective as previous cartridgevreplacements which were very good.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality. Shaves close. Lasts a long time (18 months or longer). Arrived speedily.  My Braun shaver has lasted for years, and these replacement heads meet the same quality.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband, he always use it and buy it trought Amazon because is the best price and way to buy it.</li>
    <li> Good product, good value!  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Got these for my father. Now he can save everyday.</li>
    <li> How often these days can you say that these days? It doesn&#x27;t tear my face like the worn out unit did and it fits the razor. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> We looked everywhere for a replacement foil and cutter and were so happy to find this on amazon. It fits my husbands razor and it works great - just like new.</li>
    <li> Performed very well. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but I was expecting a closer and quicker shave from it compared to my previous cutter and foil.</li>
    <li> Braun, you guys need to mark more clearly just which shaver this is for.  I had to do a return because of your mis-management of the information.  Amazon, you too.  Please be more observant.  I had to go another week using my old cartridge to shave.  Ouch!</li>
    <li> Authentic Braun Item.&lt;br /&gt;Fit perfect. Slight change from original foil, but works great!&lt;br /&gt;1/2 the price of retail.&lt;br /&gt;Much closer shave than worn out original.</li>
    <li> Right product,  right price.</li>
    <li> Braun brand so its a perfect fit.  Price from Amazon is better than anywhere else I found.  Snap the old one off and snap this into place.  RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> I still get a better shave from a blade, but the Braun shaver is fine for daily use.  Sometimes I use a blade in addition to the electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Provided replacement head that was not available in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked as expected when installed.  Will reorder when replacement is needed.</li>
    <li> The new design only stayed sharp for about 3 weeks, compared to the old blades that lasted a year.  I don&#x27;t like this new design. This would make me change to a different brand of shaver.</li>
    <li> New screen is more apt to pull on longer whiskers, causing a more painful shave if a day is skipped.</li>
    <li> Fit as advertised, and works fine.</li>
    <li> Fits my old razor perfect but a bit pricey. I can get a completely new razor (different one) at the drug store for about the same money.</li>
    <li> I was very glad to find I could order these blades for I couldn&#x27;t find them at the store anymore. It would have&lt;br /&gt;meant my husband would have to buy another shaver when he likes the one he has.</li>
    <li> Pretty basic idea..replacement cutter and screen. Yes, makes your shaver cut like brand new. If you WEREN&#x27;T already aware of these replacement items being available..well..you don&#x27;t deserve your whiskers... Recommended.</li>
    <li> Buyer BEWARE if you have an older model that this is suppose to work with....it fit, but the foil didn&#x27;t allow for any stubble to be cut as it was too far away.  Waste of money and unfortunately the old one was in the garbage along with the packaging so I couldn&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> Works Great Just Great,  Thanks, RZ.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit / perfect performance... couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Now all I need is the plastic guard to cover the foil - would have been nice if it was included in the kit and I wouldnt puncture it.</li>
    <li> The item was just as described and worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is NOT the right foil for the Braun 370cc. The product description is wrong. If you have the 370cc be sure to order the 32s foil.</li>
    <li> The ratings need to be brought down on this part, because, as others have mentioned, it does not work with the 370cc, despite notes to the contrary in the Amazon listing.  I suggest you carefully consider if it fits your razor prior to making a purchase.</li>
    <li> I am impressed that this was made in Germany. The quality of the component is impressive. Much better cutter than I expected. I&#x27;ve used a lot of razors in 40 years, and quality is appreciated but not expected these days.</li>
    <li> Fit my Braun model 5610 as advertised.</li>
    <li> There are a ton of reviews about this issue but the bottomline is that you can no longer get the original foil and cutter so this is all there is.  It works OK for my 360 complete shaver.</li>
    <li> My last foil and cutter lasted 7 years of daily use before I was forced to buy this replacement.  It is expensive, but if you figure it will last at least 5 years then it is definitely worth it.  This cutter is a new design that fits the old model shavers and it is easier to clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a good product, but it does not fit my husband&#x27;s razor even though the numbers were correct.  I&#x27;d actually like to return it if possible.  How can I go about that?</li>
    <li> Arrived on time ..husband very happy</li>
    <li> great product always from Braun</li>
    <li> Been a while since I replaced the head and foil. After doing it, I remembered why I bought the razor in the first place ( at least ten years ago). Great shave with no pulling or pinching</li>
    <li> When I looked at the price of a new razor I was astonished.  I decided to find out how to rehab my razor instead.  Its rather easy to replace the foil and cutter and makes the razor sharp and functions like new now,  I may have to look into replacing the recharging battery.  I hear that&#x27;s possible too.  Its much less expensive to replace the cutting assembly than buying a new razor.  We live in a disposable society that makes so much excessive waste.  Using this saves money and saves the environment too.  Win Win  I like that.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. Will recommend seller.</li>
    <li> My dad loves it. It&#x27;s so good.</li>
    <li> Even though the razor is quite old this returned the razor to like new performance.  Very pleased with Braun brand.</li>
    <li> Husband is very happy that this part was replaceable for his favorite shaver--darn dog!</li>
    <li> Looks OK but I ordered the wrong one and was too late returning this.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Received when promised, excellent quality, great results.</li>
    <li> Met expectations - razor is several years old, so I was glad to be able to repair it using this part.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband - it gives a close shave and saved him from buying a new electric razor.  A great decision for both of us.</li>
    <li> The build quality is just fine.  No appreciative design improvement over the old one. The price including shipping was less than brick and mortar store.</li>
    <li> Did not fit my husband&#x27;s razor.  I either misunderstood or was not advertised correctly.  I ended up having to return it.</li>
    <li> The foil and cutter replacement fit my razor as advertised, saved me a lot versus buying from a local retail store!</li>
    <li> perfect fit and great shave what else can you say. Just make sure you get the correct foil and head. many look alike.</li>
    <li> It fits &amp; works on my Braun Contour 5790.  Yeah, I&#x27;m a little outdated when it comes to shavers, but if it works, why use something else??  The battery lasts for a week of shaving each morning, so I&#x27;ll use it until it dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It now shaves just like it was brand new.  I&#x27;m happy, AND I paid less than what Wal* wants!</li>
    <li> Parts start rusting. I just don&#x27;t get it. This is the second replacement I&#x27;ve bought and still it rusts. . .</li>
    <li> My electric shaver: Braun Series 3 370&lt;br /&gt;On the back of my shaver, it says \\&quot;Use Parts 31s\\&quot; and also says \\&quot;Type:5737\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the description and product features has no mention of my actual Type, everything else mentioned was accurate, so I took a small risk buying this replacement hoping it&#x27;ll fit my model. And thankfully, it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, it works great. Had a great time re-using my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will caution all potential buyers to make sure you check your shaver carefully for exactly what the model #&#x27;s are. Check the back, and the manual if you have it before buying it.</li>
    <li> The item is as describe and fit perfectly on razor.&lt;br /&gt;Look like that new foil and cutter go better after each shave&lt;br /&gt;I recommended</li>
    <li> Shipped from Korea.  Took three plus weeks to get it but came as advertised.  Good price, very easy to install, works fine.</li>
    <li> The blades work just fine.  Just make sure of model number and you should be good to go.</li>
    <li> works well and saved the razor from going to land fill</li>
    <li> According to the packaging this fits my Braun electric razor.  Instead, I now own a $23 blade for someone else&#x27;s razor system - this simply does not fit the razor it is advertised to fit.</li>
    <li> Excellent, delivery from US faster than quoted. 100%</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly, as you would expect with an OEM part. Great way to extend the life of your shaver.</li>
    <li> Other reviewers have had this problem also: Braun&#x27;s replacement foil/cutter replacement system is confusing at best. Three-year old shaver model # was not listed on any of the replacement packs. However, the shaver itself said: \\&quot;Use Part 31-S\\&quot;. However, 31-S did not fit and I wasted $25, and I still cannot figure out the proper replacement. I give up, and I&#x27;m buying a new shaver (not Braun).</li>
    <li> I had noticed in the past that the replacement head/foil was never as good as the original.  I don&#x27;t think the replacements are made in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is getting to be a racket at this price.  You can buy a perfectly good shaver complete for not much more.  This last set was even worse than usual.</li>
    <li> very good foil and cutter</li>
    <li> The replacement does not fit properly and \\&quot;pops\\&quot; off while my husband is shaving.  This is the correct replacement part for his shaver, so I don&#x27;t know what the problem is! It is very frustrating.</li>
    <li> Great Product and Price!!</li>
    <li> Blade replacements and they work. Grill fits and works with no problems. it is a good buy. Thank you all.</li>
    <li> I was having a hard time finding this for my (about) 18 year old 5505. This fit it great and the razor shaves like new. Well it will when I get the battery replaced too. I&#x27;ve been using my 5505 since I started shaving an can&#x27;t bring myself to upgrade(downgrade?) to a new model. I&#x27;ve only shaved with this set once so I cannot comment on durability but it seems of the same quality as previous replacements.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my screen had been damaged in travel.  I hadn&#x27;t replaced the head before, and I can&#x27;t believe what a great shave I&#x27;m getting now.</li>
    <li> I know I&#x27;m \\&quot;supposed\\&quot; to change the cutter every 18 months. However, I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t grow much hair, so I never saw the need. Finally, after 7 years, I decided to replace it. I was disappointed to see little improvement, though it definitely worked. Maybe they make great products (that last 7 years) or the new cutters suck (I have to go over my face multiple times). Either way, it worked but probably wasn&#x27;t worth the price in hindsight. However, if your cutter is dull, buy these! I hope they serve you well.</li>
    <li> Who knew you actually needed to replace the blade and screen? The performance of my razor deteriorated slowly but surely, me none the wiser, finally noticed the shave sucked (after over a year). Figured out I needed a new blade and screen and like magic, a great shave again!</li>
    <li> worked great for my razor, and are very sharp n I get a smooth shave, arrived on time and in good condition</li>
    <li> excellent product, good price</li>
    <li> keeps a clean machine</li>
    <li> The angle of the foil should be more flexible (area)touching my face, somehow it works.</li>
    <li> Received package on time and was the correct fit.</li>
    <li> My razor is at least 7 years old and with this replacement it cuts like new.  Fits like a dream and renews your old razor.</li>
    <li> The thicker blades last three times longer than the original design.  After two years, I&#x27;m getting another.  I would have a thick and heavy beard if I did not shave.</li>
    <li> The Braun Foil &amp; Cutter block came very quickly from Amazon as usual.  Fast &amp; accurate delivery means no anxiety for me the customer.  I periodically replace the Foil &amp; Cutter block on my 5 year old Braun shaver and it performs like new every time!  These parts are very difficult to find locally. Replacement of the most important parts, rather than buying an entire new unit, is my contribution to fighting the current economic situation. Plus, my morning shave is faster, cleaner, and smoother.  Thank you Amazon for making it possible for me to renew &amp; retain my trusty Braun shaver.  Amazon is a global wonder!</li>
    <li> Bought to replace the foil/cutter on my Braun razor which was getting dull.  This replacement pack fit my razor (Contour 5000 series) and has worked well for the first month.</li>
    <li> It fits my Braun 5770 what more can I say? Now I can shave again and my girlfriend likes that,</li>
    <li> The product works well, but I was disappointed by how cheaply it was made.  The one I replaced had blade coils which gave a more comfortable shave, whereas the replacement was made from a piece of metal that was sliced to form blades.  The new one still gives a close shave, it just isn&#x27;t as comfortable.</li>
    <li> It appears to be, and works like the original equipment.  It was promptly shipped.  I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I wanted a spare foil and cutter for my Braun 5610, so I purchased two of these. They work for this model of Braun.</li>
    <li> The most important thing to note is that this product does replace the foil and blade for the Contour 5790.  I inserted the new parts and the razor does show a dramtic improvement.  I wish I had replaced the parts sooner.</li>
    <li> New product with unopened package. Thje foil and cutter work well and will turn your razor into a new one.</li>
    <li> New cutter is extending the life of his electric razor. It does a great job of shaving his whiskers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a few weeks now.  The product works, and easily installed onto the 5790 I&#x27;ve been using for several years with the original foil and cutter.  My only beef (and this may just be in my head) is that I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;m getting as close a shave as I did with the original foil and cutter.  Otherwise, this does just fine, and it is a heckuva lot cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
    <li> The newer model cutter (the vibrating piece), feels sharper and with more acute edges than the older model foil and cutter replacements.  This puppy can cut!!!  I am a loyal Braun user, originally Remmington; however, the Rem that I had broke within a year, and they gave me such a hassle about replacing it, I just bought a Braun instead.  I am so glad I did, these devices are built to last.  I have had my Braun 5770 for over 5 years (I believe) and not once has there been any issues with it.  No doubt that my next electric razor will be that of Braun.  If you want quality and reliability stick with a Braun.  FYI, most of the medical equipment at the hospital that I work in is manufactured by Braun too.</li>
    <li> this item has been hard to find in local stores and now it works like new again and the price is very reasonable</li>
    <li> This was perfect for the shaver. I have been looking all over locally and came up with nothing. I have bought the wrong one locally, only to need to return it and keep looking. Amazon seems to be the place that carries this foil for my husbands electric shaver. He is very happy! Me too because now his face is smooth!</li>
    <li> Use this shaver on my head about every other day.  Blades need to be sharp and they get a lot of use.  Blades are sharp, stay sharp and foil is tough.  Much better than aftermarket foils and blades</li>
    <li> This item sells for $ 29 and up on other sites.  You have to be willing to do your homework in order to get the best price, and Amazon wins again.  I have the older (much older) 5414 electric Braun and I just saved myself over a hundred bucks by not having to fork out for a new razor by just replacing the head on my old one.  I seems to do a much better job now that I have the new style screen in place.</li>
    <li> I would recommend it. Used the replacement cutter and foil and my shaver works like new. Would buy more later.</li>
    <li> just what we needed to get husbands razor working again.. very happy camper.. happy man happy wife.. razor goes to work with hinm again</li>
    <li> After owning the product for several years I can still purchase replacement parts that fit like the original. Would definately recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Everything works great, couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else so convenient with a good price. I completely feel satisfied with the part.</li>
    <li> Did not use it yet but I am sure it&#x27;s OK&lt;br /&gt;So I have no problems marking it as excellent</li>
    <li> the product was original and intact,I think that to get back to the original, if the price is much cheaper than placing an order if you think that I can recommend to my friends amazon seller a safe delivery times are also very good products.</li>
    <li> Exact replacement for my Braun shaver as listed on package and improved shave.</li>
    <li> Solid item and cheaper than other sellers. The foil surface is smooth and the blade cuts very smoothly as well.</li>
    <li> Got this to revitalise the 3 years old shaver. shaver is now back to new again and shaves close again. Great and cheap way to get the shaver you bought back again</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband&#x27;s Brau razor.  He had used it daily for about 2 years.  He put this on and it worked great and he&#x27;s happy again.  Happy Husband, Happy Wife!!</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Extremely fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Perfornance did not meet expectation</li>
    <li> Perfect fit, and it works as advertiser.</li>
    <li> factory replacement, does the job.  Hard to find this particular item other than online.</li>
    <li> Braun must be changing the quality of its replacement blades and foil as they are lasting far less longer than they used to...and they should.  I am actually getting razor cuts from a blade/foil that is less than a year old.  Time to buy another brand.</li>
    <li> fit perfectly. better shave now for certain.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s genuine Braun.  I usually replace about every 18-24 months.  After replacement, the shave is immediately both gentler and more thorough.</li>
    <li> These replacement foils and cutters are great!&lt;br /&gt;They make my shaver work like new!!!&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery. Fair price!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> My husband has used this product for years and just buys the refills. Great price for the combo and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly on my series 5000 shaver. I didn&#x27;t realize how dull the old cutters were until I shaved with the new ones. It definitely made a difference.</li>
    <li> Works fine, easy to replace.  Still, at 50% of the cost of a new razor it seems a little pricey.</li>
    <li> The foil fits well into my Contour 3860. Overall I am very satisfied with the quality and longevity of the metal foil.</li>
    <li> Good deal. The real Mccoy.</li>
    <li> delivered on time and works great</li>
    <li> keepin&#x27; the old shaver going works fine for me.</li>
    <li> i believe the shaver part i ordered is the wrong size for my shaver  this is the second time i ordered the wrong part.&lt;br /&gt;the first time i returned it and got the right part.  but i had ordered it as a series, so every 18 months or so i am automatically sent the part again.&lt;br /&gt;although i had returned the wrong part the first time, that did not change the subsequent automatic sending of the wrong one.</li>
    <li> I RECIEVED A 1 FOIL &amp; CUTTER GRILLE MY BRAUN IS A SERIES 3 TYPE 5742 MODELE 5742  MODELO 5742.NOTHING FITS i DON&#x27;T KNOW HOW ELSE TO EXPLAIN IT MY TAKEN THESE FROM THE PAMPLET I RECEIVED WHEN I WAS GIVEN THE RAZOR.SO AM OUT $24.73 PLUS SHIPPING.SOMETIME YOU MUST LEARN A LESSON THE HARD WAY.BACK TO REMEMTON RAND.</li>
    <li> So glad we got this... we were going to throw away the razor -- but now it is just like new!</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
    <li> They worked great. Worth getting new ones to keep your husband face nice and smooth. Just remember to tell men about how rough their face feels sometime.</li>
    <li> At last - shaving restored to &#x60;proper&#x60; result!</li>
    <li> It was the perfect fit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a rechargeable Braun shaver for over 10 years and its still going strong. Occasionally the cutters need to be replaced. This is the second set I&#x27;ve gotten from Amazon, and I am satisfied. Fast shipping, perfect fit, no complaints. Restored my razor to like-new performance for a minimal cost.</li>
    <li> Just didn&#x27;t realize how worn out my last foil and cutter were and the new one works very well so my face thanks you Amazon!</li>
    <li> This fits the Braun 5610 model and works very well. Based on some reviews, I was worried that it would not fit this model, but it was a perfect match.</li>
    <li> When you need a replacement head, this is the best place I&#x27;ve found to get one. Since made by braun, you don&#x27;t have to worry about it fitting/working.</li>
    <li> This replacment pack fits my razor perfectly. My OEM Foil and Cutter lasted 2 years. This new combination works better than the OEM version. Closer shave and less irritation.</li>
    <li> this was actually pretty good. i got great results and it worked just fine. i was actually a little worried that it wasn&#x27;t going to work, but i was wrong.</li>
    <li> This product is a perfect replacement and the price was very reasonable instead of a new shaver.</li>
    <li> Hard to catch them on the shelves at local stores so Amazon is the way to go.  Have had the razor for years</li>
    <li> This replacement is just as good as the original, great quality and price is not too bad, shipping was as expected on time.</li>
    <li> I got my pkg before the schedule date and it works perfectly thank you Amazon for existing!</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement! Made my razor like new</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and item is correct.</li>
    <li> This replaced a foil and cutter which were about 3 years old, and I&#x27;d forgotten how well they used to work until using this replacement pack. I feel it was priced well and certainly provides a shave like my razor is brand new again. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if this is a knock-off but the cutter is different from the last one and doesn&#x27;t work as well as the old did when it was new</li>
    <li> The shaver parts arrived sooner than I was told to expect them, and they were the correct parts for my shaver.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my father&#x27;s old razzor as he was having difficulty finding the right model. They seem to work well and were easy to install.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my husband.  Had trouble trying to figure out if I had the right one or not as the picture and what shaver we had didn&#x27;t match perfectly but I must have picked the right one.</li>
    <li> the parts I received were the correct one, i.e. foil and cutter. While they work well, I was expecting a marked improvement over the ones I have on the razor, but I only got a marginal improvement. I am considering switching to something else to shave.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT SHAVER @ GREAT PRICE!</li>
    <li> My husband has used Braun electric razors for YEARS!  But, he has been consistently unhappy with replacement blades - they do not last.  The edge of the latest blade we have received has already broken( or split) on the side.  that happened about 2 weeks ago.  We did not receive an invoice with that shipment - no paperwork at all.  Will be returning them for a refund, and then decide on a new razor.  Thanks for your attention.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, works as expected.</li>
    <li> German quality,good as excepted</li>
    <li> It was everything that we expected.  It is working well.</li>
    <li> It was great to get a replacement instead of buying a brand new razer.  The razer is working almost better then when we got it.  We are pleased.</li>
    <li> Excellent replacement combination</li>
    <li> I have a Series 5 (5770) shaver and this fit well. The foil opening is smaller than my original foil, but it still work as if it is new. Will definitely buy another set as spare.</li>
    <li> Hard to find this series replacement,so very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> this is new part# for braun razors 4000 to 6000 series most stores online don,t tell you this info. this seller had item in stock +a great price also a bonus of free shipping when iordered. item arrived before est. time of arrival. would order again in a second!!</li>
    <li> Braun makes some of the best shavers around, untill you have to get replacement parts for them. Then it&#x27;s amazon to the rescue, with prices that are some what reasonable and quality and supply to boot. These replacement cutters fit well and do the job there suposed to do which pleases me, nuff said. Thanks</li>
    <li> Product was received exactly as shown and very quickly.</li>
    <li> I received the Foil and Cutter Replacement promptly and hopefully it will fit when I eventually use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I ordered it, I discovered that, with careful work, damaged foils can be removed from your current unit and, if you have other undamaged foils from prior packages, the undamaged foils can be replaced:  it sort of snaps in place.  The replaced foil did come loose once but I then secured it with a little drop of airplane glue and have now been using the repaired foil unit for a couple of months.  Just a little tip from a cheapskate!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the ease of operation and the shaving results that I achieve on a daily basis. .</li>
    <li> Perfect fit and performance at a great price.</li>
    <li> Hard to love but I do need to shave and have bought this item 3 times to keep my Braun shaver model 5610 working like new. Wish they would more closely align the replacement parts with model numbers.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and as described.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in 2days in excellent condition.  It was easy to install and has worked flawlessly.  I am very satisfied and would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It fits my Braun Contour razor.</li>
    <li> This replacement cutter and foil fits a lot better than the last one I purchased. I am happy and I recommend this replacement part.</li>
    <li> My shaver is pretty old.  These replacement parts work perfectly.  They arrived  promptly and work as they should. That&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun Series 3 370s3 Type 5774&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the unit...the shave is smooth and close&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement head pack for this unit is not the old style&lt;br /&gt;two piece...one foil...one cutter block in the package&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new style is called a cassette head&lt;br /&gt;the foil and cutter all built into one piece&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads-up:&lt;br /&gt;Under the product description by Amazon you will find&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;frequently bought together\\&quot; items listed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 31s replacement head pack was listed for the unit I purchased&lt;br /&gt;this is the two piece old style and will not work with the shaver listed above&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 32s cassette head is the replacement needed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps: did not want the hassle of sending back the 31s for a refund&lt;br /&gt;so I kept it and used the head on my old unit as a back-up shaver</li>
    <li> I bought this for a series 5885 Braun shaver that had never worked well.  This cutter/foil combination is a vast improvement over the original.  It&#x27;s still not as good as my earlier Panasonic shaver, but good enough to keep using it and not throw it in the garbage.</li>
    <li> It fits on my Series 3 Braun shaver. It is working fine. The price was good too. I recommend to buy this item.</li>
    <li> Good replacement foil and cutter, just a little pricey for what it is.</li>
    <li> I have a Braun 5610 that I&#x27;ve had for over 10 years, this replacement pack fit perfect and brought my old razor back to life. Works like new.</li>
    <li> Makes my razor shave like new.</li>
    <li> I fit my razor just right.  That is what I was looking for. Thanks for having it in stock and getting it shipped promptly.</li>
    <li> Does not seem to shave as well, looks like it is made cheaper then the originals, the inside plastic guides are thinner.</li>
    <li> When it was time to replace the foil and cutter on my Braun shaver, I ordered this set and fit perfectly.  The only down side to this new blade design is that the cutting blades are thicker and the spaces between the blades are smaller than the original design.  This minor change causes the blades to get dirty faster, making the shaving less effective and requiring cleaning after every use.  It&#x27;s worse if you have coarse hair.  It works fine but not as good as the original design with thinner blades.</li>
    <li> Not only does this fit my Braun Series 3 razor, but it works like new again.  I&#x27;m again able to get a great close shave with only gentle pressure while shaving.  These parts are all metal, rather than the original plastic edges, and appear even more durable than the original parts.  5 stars for restoring that great Braun shave I was used to.</li>
    <li> Fits well, and works well. One day I will replace this old 5000 series with a new unit, but these replacement cutters have always worked well.</li>
    <li> This replacement blade does not seem to be as sharp as the OEM that came with the shaver. The quality has gone down.</li>
    <li> Restored my shaver to like-new shape.  Foils is slightly different than the original, but works equally well.  Price is reasonable, too.</li>
    <li> Replaced my old foil after it got a hole in it and it was simple to replace and kept me shaving.</li>
    <li> My husband put this on, and he&#x27;s thankful that he got a new head...works so much&lt;br /&gt;better and shaves so much closer..just as ordered</li>
    <li> This is the third replacement cutter that I have bought. All of them worked like I expected. The shipment arrived as stated.</li>
    <li> I have a Braun model 5441 razor, and this replacement foil and cutter work very well. The removal of the old pieces and replacement with the new parts was very easy. I would recommend this if your old cutter just doesn&#x27;t seem to do the trick anymore.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item and did not know that there were many different Braun Series 3 Razors. This item did not fit my Razor. I returned the item to the seller and recieved a refund on my Credit Card for the purchase.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit and performance, makes the shaver perform as a new one for less cost than buying a new one.  Would use the same provider again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun for over 25 years, if I could find one better I would change. I just wish they didn&#x27;t cost so much for as long as the replacements last. I don&#x27;t have a tough beard, but I still only get about three to four months out of them.</li>
    <li> sorry braum i thought to buy a new razor until i bought replacement pkg. now i,m good or another 18 mos.</li>
    <li> I received the item earlier than expected. Extended the life of my razor that I have had for over 10 years. It is basically like new again.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever bought a replacement head &amp; foil for an electric shaver - and let me say it feel better than new! 4 stars, though, since there is no frickin justification for anything so simple to cost $25.</li>
    <li> Makes my electric razor work like new.  Very pleased.  Will buy again once this product wears out or breaks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> With the new head and foil I get a better shave than I did when the shaver was new.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t sure if the numbers were the correct ones, they were and were fine. they were fine. they were fine.</li>
    <li> Was glad to find a replacement for my razor. Makes it cut like new. Slightly different screen design than original.</li>
    <li> I agree with many other reviewers here.  Buried somewhere on the body of the shaver is the correct order number info.  Make sure you know exactly which cutter replacement pack you should order.  Braun usually does a very nice job but they fell down when they came up with an overly confusing parts numbering system (the only reason I didn&#x27;t rate this 5 stars).  The good news - I probably waited far too long to make this replacement.  I popped-in the new cutter &amp; foil and it was off too the races. Cuts a little closer, but the big difference is how much easier and quicker it cuts.  I spend a noticeably shorter time shaving now and my charge lasts longer as well.  Not sure if there was a re-design since my last replacement or the old cutter was just worn down so much more, but the new cutter did look different (more metal, more robust looking).  It does a great job, thanks Braun.</li>
    <li> I hunted all over for this and couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores.  This made my day.  I didn&#x27;t have to go out for it.</li>
    <li> I never knew how much a new foil and cutter would make. My shaver is like new now. Cuts very close and smooth.</li>
    <li> Works as good as new again. Am going to buy another pack for future use.</li>
    <li> works great, but broke down after 1 yr</li>
    <li> I know there is some confusion on whether this replacement pack works on certain Braun shavers. I just installed this on my old Braun 6520 (5705) and it seems to fit and work fine. The foil pattern is different from the previous pattern, but seems to be more in-line with more modern Braun models. Other than that, there are minor differences in the color of the plastic parts (e.g. silver foil housing, which actually matches my shaver).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the new foil and cutter, it easily took care of several days growth of beard. I only use for travel, but will further prolong the life of the shaver (over 10 years old).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate the replacement pack 5 starts because it fits my shaver well, and it restores (and possibly improves) the original performance.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement. As some noted, it&#x27;s not the original, but I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> seems to work fine, decent price, lasts for 9-12 months; not much else to say ... it either works or doesn&#x27;t and this is a good replacement if one needed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on a subscription for this to keep my razor running smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Not very happy about the price going up a couple of bucks.  If it bumps up again, I&#x27;ll cancel my subscription.</li>
    <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have waited so long to get this. It makes a huge difference. It breathed new life into my 6 year old shaver.</li>
    <li> As is typical with many supplies, this is relatively expensive given the overall price of a brand new shaver. But you don&#x27;t have much choice do you? It works fine and fits the shaver just fine.</li>
    <li> What can you say about a shaving head on a ten year old razor.  Other then it works fine and cuts my facial hair just like it did ten years ago.  With money you can have anything.</li>
    <li> Reorder of product I have used for years. As ordered. No problems.</li>
    <li> It was easy to install, remove old one and install new and start shaving. Beats buying a new razor $$</li>
    <li> a little on the pricey side but i only have replace my braun series foil and cutter for twice a year</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t make the mistake I did.  If you have a Braun 8000 series shaver, this foil will not fit.  I wish that Braun would make clear what foil/cutter will fit what shaver!</li>
    <li> Did not want to throw away my shaver since it still works great. Just needed the foil, a little pricey but nonetheless cheaper than purchasing a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went ahead and replaced both foil &amp; cutter since I had the option to. Doesn&#x27;t tear my face up anymore as it used to since my old foil had parts where the foil gave in. Whenever I&#x27;d pass over that area it would prick and be uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> My brother prefers this brand.</li>
    <li> exactly as ordered, works fine</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and I found it here.</li>
    <li> Great product.  My Braun  shaver is almost 10 years old and it&#x27;s comforting to know the replacement foil is so easily available.</li>
    <li> very good element ten points</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find that I could get this part because I love this razor. Excellent price too.</li>
    <li> Used for my Braun 5000 series - type 5736. It fits perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wondering how to turn off the flashing red &amp;#34;replace&amp;#34; symbol? It shuts off automatically after you change blades. (Wish they said it in the manual).</li>
    <li> This is a re order  for my Dad he used this type of razor and he wanted to replace his razor head . it had work very well for him before so he wanted them again .</li>
    <li> I have been using an older Braun 5610 model for around 10 years and the foil finally gave out... I was happy to find this part and get to replace both the foil and the cutter simultaneously. It was very easy to switch out the part as well; probably 3 steps and done. Fortunately the internal motor and battery pack have continued to run well even after all these years and with this replacement, it is like having a brand new razor, so if you are in the same boat, I would definitely recommend this part replacement.</li>
    <li> My best razor ever and getting replacements parts extends the its life.  I now know where to go to keep it working for a longer time.</li>
    <li> It works just like stock</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 3 replacement was perfect. My husband like it and I am glad it was the right order. Thanks</li>
    <li> Hi, I have the &amp;#34;XYZ&amp;#34; razor... I need new blades, oh here we go, the &amp;#34;XYZ replacement pack.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Should be that simple huh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, with Braun, its &amp;#34;Series 3&amp;#34; Oh, I mean the &amp;#34;370&amp;#34; Oh I mean, &amp;#34;formerly the 5000/6000 series&amp;#34; oh I mean, flip up the side burn trimmer for MORE SECRET NUMBERS!  Under here we have the &amp;#34;5774&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;32S&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my ONE RAZOR is called the:&lt;br /&gt;- &amp;#34;Series 3&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;- &amp;#34;370&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;- &amp;#34;5000/6000&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;- &amp;#34;32S&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;- &amp;#34;5774&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let me ask you... are you SURE these are the right blades for your razor???</li>
    <li> Fits and works Great on the 5790 Braun Contour!!!  Great Price, I would buy again. I give it five stars!!!</li>
    <li> Very good buy at Amazon/</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these for years, but the latest one is manufactured differently, and definitely doesn&#x27;t cut nearly as well as any of the previous ones.  If you look at the blades, you can see that they&#x27;re different.  The foil appears to be the same, or at least with less obvious differences.  It now takes a lot longer to make sure I get a clean shave.  I now have to always go over areas that I already shaved because it doesn&#x27;t shave consistently (some places closer than others.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest buying from somewhere that may have old stock - i.e., blades that were made using their previous manufacturing technology.</li>
    <li> This replacement foil and cutter make my old 5000 series Braun work like a new one. Replace every couple of years.</li>
    <li> Is not the same quality as the original part. On almost evey use if beard stubble is more than two days old, it nicks and pulls the hair.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 3 Combi 31s Foil And Cutter Replacement Pack fits my Braun model 5614 shaver and works very well. It is a perfect match.</li>
    <li> the product came through alright.  But installing it is not easy and it is kind of flimsy.  The screen and its attachment can be very easily damaged.  Why isn&#x27;t the original foil part easily obtained instead?</li>
    <li> It was great, the foil was a little too small but the blades worked great.</li>
    <li> New blade and foil works much better than my old worn on.  The design looks updated and seems to improve quality of the shave. Great price and quick delivery</li>
    <li> works as expected. satisfied customer</li>
    <li> Fit my Braun 5000 series shaver perfectly.</li>
    <li> Is it wrong that I think these replacement foils are overpriced? It&#x27;s nice to be able to shave.</li>
    <li> It fits my Braun, a close shave.....</li>
    <li> Have the old shaver, I like the shaver so I found the blade kit so I ordered.</li>
    <li> Works great and is a lot cheaper than going to the Braun web site.</li>
    <li> on time and as expected.</li>
    <li> my old one works mush better then this new replacement. Should have returned it. Maybe it needs to be broken in.</li>
    <li> These cutters and screen foil are tough and durable, and last a long time.  The Braun shaver has been reliable and works effortlessly.</li>
    <li> My Braun 5775 is still going strong.  This replacement foil and cutter made it feel like a brand new razor.</li>
    <li> Made my razor like new again.</li>
    <li> The blade works as effectively as the original part did three years ago. The cover is also fine. (My machine is Braun 5885.)</li>
    <li> Whoever the brand manager is for these shavers is not very intelligent.  The model numbers of the replacements don&#x27;t match up very well to the model numbers of the shavers very well.  I had to really dig pretty deep on their website to find the right replacement head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that...It&#x27;s exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews about this not fitting everything. I have a Braun Contour 5790 and this fitted in a matter of seconds. The shave is now so much closer its not even funny. With a 3-5 day beard, before I changed the foil and cutter unit, it would never take off all the whiskers, forcing me to use a handheld manual razor. But now with this replacement, I can quickly get rid of a longer-than-normal beard very easily.</li>
    <li> Oem. Very nice! Fits 5000 series. Cost fraction of boxed model from store. I owned Braun shaver for years and new blades gave it new life.</li>
    <li> This makes my shaver practically new again!  Just pops right on and away you go.  I&#x27;ll replace the heads sooner next time. Fast delivery, too.</li>
    <li> Old blades were irritating my face.  New blades popped right in and it is a brand new shaver now.  Good buy</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t give it the full 5 stars because I always like to leave room for improvement.&lt;br /&gt;But the packaging, description &amp; delivery time were right on.  I would definitely recommend this for those who need it.</li>
    <li> with the expense and questionable quality of the items out there, you can&#x27;t be this  it is the real deal  excellent</li>
    <li> Worked great. Shipped wuickly</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what they are doing anymore, but this is not the foil that came on my razor or the style that Braun used to make a couple years back.  When I bought my razor about 4 years ago,  the foil had larger holes and looked more delicate and sharp. That foil lasted me well over a year with great quality. The next one was the same which lasted me over a year.  Now when I bought this, the holes in the foil were so small and it was quite rigid, not allowing much hair to get through.  This foil lasted me about 2 months before I started getting razor bumps from making 10 times more passes over my neck than I had to in the past. This foil is a piece of garbage and when I found 2 of the old style in Korea, I immediately payed 30$ each for them just to ensure a good shave for another 2 years.  I highly recommend looking for a store nearby to find one of the older styles and if it is a bit more money than on Amazon, buy it because it will last you 5 times longer than this new-style foil.</li>
    <li> I fell prey to the advertisement \\&quot;31S is a newer model of the 31B\\&quot;. So I bought one, only to discover that the 31S foil has larger spaces in the center cutting blades than the 31B which causes the foil cutter to chew up your skin to the point of drawing blood around my lips. The pair of new 31S internal blades work well with my old 31B foil cover. The problem is all in the design of the center cutting blades of the 31S foil cover. The only place that I can find 31B is from South Korean companies thru ebay. In my case Amazon let me down when they stopped selling the 31B. They probably will not post this review and a lot of customers out there will have their faces chewed up.</li>
    <li> The foil on this older version is ok, but the cutter block is not as refined as the newer version. If I could do it over I would spend the extra money and get the newer version first.</li>
    <li> The replacement foil and cutter fits my 5 series shaver however it does not cut as well as the original cutter that came with my shaver. I spend more time shaving with the replacement cutter and I feel it does not cut as well.</li>
    <li> The foil seems to be a down-grade of the foil I previously bought several years ago.  The Braun 6520 shaver itself is a marvelous model.  I&#x27;ve had it for many years and it has slowed down only a little.</li>
    <li> no problems, like a new shaver</li>
    <li> It works just like the original - as expected.</li>
    <li> Not sure what problem others have had, but it&#x27;s the right replacement for my boyfriends razor.  He hasn&#x27;t had any issues with it at all.  Replaced and has used for a few months now.</li>
    <li> Fits the shaver and works great.  It is better than buying a new one since all other parts are okay.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly and fast shipping. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  It fit my razor and it works.  Do I really love it?  No, but then I wasn&#x27;t looking for a relationship when I ordered it.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews and learning how Braun consolidated and redesigned all Foil and Cutter combo replacements, I took a gamble and bought this for my older Braun Series 5 model # 8975. The parts fit perfectly, and my older razor is now giving the best shave ever at half the cost. The only trade off is that although the old clear plastic cover fits over the new Series 3 blade, it does not click and lock; rather, it just stays on by pressure. This isn&#x27;t a big deal, because you remove this to you shave anyway. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy the redesigned Series 5 Foil and Cutter combo!</li>
    <li> It fit and works great</li>
    <li> this is what you need to replace occassionally...good price here.</li>
    <li> Twenty year old razor works like new.....</li>
    <li> I purchased these because my current Braun shaver still works great.  They cut well - as good as the original.  Good investment!!</li>
    <li> Have always used Braun and have been spoiled by the products.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and not expensive to keep up to date..</li>
    <li> Bought this set to change dull cutter on my Flex Integral and to replace foil. Works perfect and makes my 10+ years shaver work once again as new.</li>
    <li> work&#x27;s  great.i had  a  hard  time  finding  it as  my  shaver  is  15  year&#x27;s  old  and  i  refuse to  give  it  up  as i don&#x27;t  like  the  newer  one&#x27;s</li>
    <li> fit my husbands shaver perfectly!</li>
    <li> Replaced the foil and blades and once again, the Braun shaves like brand new! Thanks for a brilliant product!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ll see whether this iteration of the Foil and Cutter replacement lasts as long as the original part I had been using.</li>
    <li> I have a Braun 5874 Contour, original 5000 series, which I purchased around 7-8 years ago, it was one of the last models that was made in Germany at the time.  Any way, this replacement foil and cutter fits this model.</li>
    <li> It took almost a month to ship this from China or somewhere and the quality makes that apparent. Its suppose to be brand new and is in a brand new package, but it must be from a batch of manufacturer&#x27;s rejects because its barely any &#x27;sharper&amp;#34; than the 8 month old one I was replacing. Be very very wary of these guys.</li>
    <li> after years of wear and tear and my old foil for my braun electric shaver; I&#x27;ve decided to get a new one. To my surprise this was a great purchase because I got a much better and much closer shave then I used to. My face felt smoother and I felt more confident in myself. I also bought it because it was at a cheap price when I bought this.</li>
    <li> The product was the exact requirement for my 6 year old razor from Brawn. Price and delivery were excellant and I will probably re-order in another year.</li>
    <li> I looked all over for this foil and cutter. Many diff stores.&lt;br /&gt;thks for having this product on your web site and the price was the best.</li>
    <li> It Works like animal-exellent!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Keep my old Braun going and going and . . .</li>
    <li> I was not 100% sure if it would fit my now older Braun 5770. But after receiving it snapped right in without any problems.</li>
    <li> The product worked as advertised.  Was a bit confusing given they have changed model numbers for the 5000 series and that info was mentioned in some locations but not others.  It is even stronger looking than the original part.</li>
    <li> These blades are cheap imitations of the real thing that I have been ordering from amazon for years. They are worse than my old dull blades. I took my time with Braun&#x27;s confusing part numbers.  This is a compatible but inferior replacement set.  It has the same part number and packaging as past replacement blades.  The rounded blades inside the foil block used to be perpendicular to the foil.  Now they are parallel and have much more surface area.  I had to apply more pressure and repeat strokes on the same area to get all the hair that past replacements handled with one pass and less pressure.  I am returning it.</li>
    <li> Very good purchase happy with the product</li>
    <li> The product was as described and arrived in good time.  Will do business with the vendor again in the future.</li>
    <li> Would buy again and again.  Husband loves the shave it gives.  Easy to replace.  Give it a try. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Authentic product at a much better price than at local retailers.</li>
    <li> Parts are by shaver manufacturer and far less expensive then if purchased in a retail outlet.  Arrived on time and easily replaced the worn parts, so shaver is once again like new.</li>
    <li> Received it over the new year. Definitely not the same build as the original. Tighter fit, different design, and even the blades seems to be different in terms of the composite metal. The original was titanium. That was why I bought it. LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the shaving experience is still pretty much the same. But i cannot vouch if the difference in the blade or foil itself, has somehow make shaving over the same area requiring more repetitions. It cut smoothly for a new blade, but when it misses, it really misses. Overnight stubble or 3 days old makes no difference when it misses. I am putting down to the coil having different hole sizes to catch hair of different thickness. The original foil hole sizes are uniform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, until I can convince myself to get a new shaver, this replacement is good for those still on this model. For older men with thick stubby hair like me, will definitely have to check in the mirror for any misses. Hope this help in your purchase.</li>
    <li> This unit is half the cost of what I pay in other areas of the country at retail. I replace the head and cutters annually and now have used the razor for over 8 years because of that. A great investment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this Braun electric for quite some time.  Every year, I order a new foil and cutter for same.  Still like new.</li>
    <li> It fit my razor perfect and shaves just as good as the original.</li>
    <li> Works Great much easy to use only change and watch the hair fall</li>
    <li> Now my husband can use his favorite shaver again!</li>
    <li> A little cheaper than the original but it seems to work ok.</li>
    <li> The foil and cutter both fit my 5441 perfectly.  What more can I say.  Haven&#x27;t tried a cut yet but will soon.</li>
    <li> My face was starting to look like the ground chuck packages at the local meat market.  Time to replace the 3 year old foil &amp; cutters on the Braun!  I was worried that I couldn&#x27;t find the matching set for a 6 year old Braun shaver.  What was I thinking, I can find ANYTHING on Amazon!  I received the 31S combi pak yesterday &amp; what a difference!  I couldn&#x27;t even tell that I was slicing &amp; dicing 4 days worth of facial bristle.  The face came out smooth as silk.  Now my dog can stop looking at my face like its her next meal.  Ugh.</li>
    <li> I bought my 5,000 contour many years ago and have procrastinated on purchasing a new foil/cutter head because they are so expensive in stores. I&#x27;ve been wasting my money and blood on safety razors and finally had enough of cutting my neck and tossing a razor after two shaves.  I finally ordered a new replacement and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the shave and simplicity of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one has a plastic housing where as my original had a metal housing. But it still works great.</li>
