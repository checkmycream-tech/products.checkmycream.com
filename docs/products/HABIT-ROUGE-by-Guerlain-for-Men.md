      <li>/&gt;Oh, and the best part</li>
      <li>I have been using this fragrance for years and this was a very good price.</li>
      <li>1965 was a very good year indeed.</li>
      <li>Extremely pleasant fragrance with wonderful undertones.  </li>
      <li>and I allways get great products</li>
      <li>Great scent  </li>
      <li>The employee was happy with the gift, but commented that the quality of the pefume was subpar.  </li>
      <li>floral yet leathery, great from morning to night</li>
      <li>Habit Rouge opens up with a good dose of bergamot, orange, and cinnamon.</li>
      <li>My son loved cologne.</li>
      <li>so i was delighted to find it at Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a wonderful soft smelling spray that I find incredible appealing on him!  </li>
      <li>My product came on time, i&#x27;m very satisfied</li>
      <li>I was very pleased by the price at Amazon.  </li>
      <li>You will love it!</li>
      <li>I was quite impressed with the first couple sprays after opening the package.</li>
      <li>The price is quite reasonable and it smells great!</li>
      <li>Make it your own.</li>
      <li>So I was extremely pleased when I one day just decided to check Amazon and lo and behold</li>
      <li>My husband has worn this scent for many years now.  </li>
      <li>It was mostly my fault for not purchasing my cologne in person, but I had been looking all over for vanilla-scented cologne, and Habit Rouge kept getting mentioned.</li>
      <li>I love when he wears it..</li>
      <li>and he has enjoyed it since then.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I describe it as smelling more \\&quot;European\\&quot; or \\&quot;French.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>it glad I looked on amazon</li>
      <li>and I have been using it for many years.</li>
      <li>as have I :)</li>
      <li>But even then it&#x27;s becoming fewer and farther between being able to find any.</li>
      <li>It was amazing how quickly it got here.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the most confident, unapologetic, secure man who wears this.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Whatever the history and beliefs of this fine scent, it wears well on me and has for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Light and refreshing with staying power.</li>
      <li>I received this product as a Christmas gift a couple of years ago, it smell so good that I very rearly used</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a huge 8-oz amber jug of this stuff on my dresser for years.</li>
      <li>I am an addict of de guerlain products and Habit Rouge is yet another de guerlain product that I enjoy using.</li>
      <li>The cinnamon drifts in and out throughout, and at moments you&#x27;ll catch the labdanum, oakmoss, benzoin and sandlewood as a light incense accord.</li>
      <li>I have never found a better oriental male fragrance more perfect than this.&lt;br /&gt;Words are not enough to review it.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>A classic and elegant scent for men!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really smell like vanilla, but it has a wonderful, powdery-floral scent, a little sweet, perhaps, but it is finely balanced, and I love the way it changes and deepens throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Buy this and you will have made the right choice!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s no longer a problem, and I was delighted to rediscover it during a recent trip to Paris.</li>
      <li>As the hours pass, the rose subsides into a chord with powdery amber and soft oiled leather.</li>
      <li>Orange blossom, leather, and personal musk seem to say: I&#x27;m here, I&#x27;m safe, I&#x27;m confident in myself, relax with me.</li>
      <li>I first purchased Habit Rouge at a Duty Free Shop years ago</li>
      <li>Not a blind buy!</li>
      <li>This amazing perfume brings me 10 years back !!</li>
      <li>Later kind of musky.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Fresh scent that has the overtones of a baby powder</li>
      <li>I get compliments on this all the time (mostly from old ladies, but still).</li>
      <li>The citrus and bright floral elements fade pretty quickly, and it settles into a dusty, musky, ambery rose.</li>
      <li>This is a classic scent from the fine perfume house of Guerlain.</li>
      <li>to the point, both my late wife and the new lady in my life loved the scent, and isn&#x27;t pleasing your partner the most important reason to wear a scent?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A woman CAN wear it, but she probably has to be a certain type -- early middle age, brainy, independent minded, but still relentlessly sexy, and proud of it all.</li>
      <li>Habit Rouge Cologne was launched by Guerlain in 1965 as a &amp;#34;refreshing, oriental fragrance.&amp;#34; I sense a pleasant blend of fresh citrus, lemon, mandarin, peppery spices, old leather and vanilla, with some coffee and chocolate notes as it wears off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As a first time perfume purchase, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should go for this, but the reviews of Guerlain perfumes appeared to be positive in general.</li>
      <li>However, this cologne has a very poignant woodsy smell, and it honestly reminded me of something a much older man would wear.</li>
      <li>I first found it in Paris some 20 years ago</li>
      <li>It is the same scent that I know and love and remember.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve only ever been able to find it in the Caribbean on cruisers.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know much about colognes and perfumes, but understand this is something of a &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; scent people used to wear back in the good old days.</li>
      <li>The reviews for this perfume were quite positive as well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is sweet, but not near so sweet as Dior Homme or Dreamer by Versace.</li>
      <li>I get compliments on the scent, more than I&#x27;ve gotten from any cologne I&#x27;ve ever worn, the aroma will stay with you all day and through the evening, but it take a hour or so after putting it on for it to calm down.</li>
      <li>I readily understand that women may enjoy wearing this fragrance, but from a male perspective it retains a positive masculinity.</li>
      <li>Pricing on Amazon was better than I found anywhere else, and the product arrived sooner than expected, as I&#x27;ve come to expect from Amazon.</li>
      <li>Thanks a million.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>thank you so much.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a real perfume, it looks like a lot of alcohol.</li>
      <li>IMO this is THE male oriental, the one that all others must be judged by, and that most later examples of the genre are probably ripoffs of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Habit</li>
      <li>He created Guerlain&#x27;s classic men&#x27;s fragrances V&amp;eacute;tiver (1959) and Habit Rouge (1965).</li>
      <li>But it is a fabulous, long lasting, and well worth the money, scent.&lt;br</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Russian leather\\&quot; is a classic no amateur perfume historian should miss, since it&#x27;s the basis for so many other scents that have been derived from it -- including Gentleman, which I also review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely one of the classic older styles.</li>
      <li>Fantastic add to my slow but steadily growing collection!</li>
      <li>I am 47 years old as well.</li>
      <li>I remember this cologne from the 1970&#x27;s when I was a young man</li>
      <li>As far as I know, these people are making the last of the classic Russian leathers that can be bought at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>the smell would last at least 7 more hours than the one I gave him.  </li>
      <li>People&#x27;s senses operate differently and colognes smell differently on different people, so it doesn&#x27;t really matter what I think of it, but it suits me well.</li>
      <li>I know none of the major stores or chains here in the United States carry it.</li>
      <li>It is definitely much different from the typical \\&quot;American\\&quot; style scent that all seem to have notes of musk/wood/greenery or other extremely strong overtones.  </li>
      <li>Gents - do not be afraid of rose; it was a staple masculine scent well into the 20th century.</li>
      <li>No strange chemical notes.  </li>
      <li>Guerlain apparently did here was to take the classic formula for a \\&quot;Russian leather\\&quot; -- leather, citrus, spices, amber and vanilla -- and add a few floral notes and a lot of sandalwood to turn it into an oriental -- or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> From the initial citrus... not a strong citrus... to the cinnamon spicy and sweet dry down that reminded me of \\&quot;Red</li>
<li> Ladies, if you are tired of getting bowled over by the typical overpowering colognes worn by most men these days, choose this one.</li>
<li> One of my favorites for a long time.</li>
<li> I ran out of mine a long long time ago</li>
<li> The fragrance lasts all day long even when sprayed sparringly.</li>
<li> If the product available here is of the same quality and price, you cannot go wrong in buying this cologne!</li>
<li> /&gt;this product to anyone who likes subtle classic fragrances.</li>
<li> Hots\\&quot; candy, and on to the lingering and scrumptious Shailmar-resembling base, this is an amazing scent that I&#x27;ll wear, often.</li>

    <li> Habit Rouge opens up with a good dose of bergamot, orange, and cinnamon. The citrus and bright floral elements fade pretty quickly, and it settles into a dusty, musky, ambery rose.

    <li> Need another one soon. pleasse</li>
    <li> I received this product as a Christmas gift a couple of years ago, it smell so good that I very rearly used it.&lt;br /&gt;I like it because the smell stays with you all day, no need for a touchup.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> My husband has worn this scent for many years now.  Everyone comments how wonderful it smells when he wears it.  It is definitely much different from the typical \\&quot;American\\&quot; style scent that all seem to have notes of musk/wood/greenery or other extremely strong overtones.  I describe it as smelling more \\&quot;European\\&quot; or \\&quot;French.\\&quot; My nose senses vanilla/lavender/floral undertones with something else (not sure what) that keeps it from being feminine.  I love when he wears it.. Ladies, if you are tired of getting bowled over by the typical overpowering colognes worn by most men these days, choose this one. You will love it!</li>
    <li> My product came on time, i&#x27;m very satisfied thank you so much.</li>
    <li> This cologne seems to have a couple of different scents. Starts out rather like flowers. Later kind of musky.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
    <li> Habit Rouge Cologne was launched by Guerlain in 1965 as a &amp;#34;refreshing, oriental fragrance.&amp;#34; I sense a pleasant blend of fresh citrus, lemon, mandarin, peppery spices, old leather and vanilla, with some coffee and chocolate notes as it wears off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More to the point, both my late wife and the new lady in my life loved the scent, and isn&#x27;t pleasing your partner the most important reason to wear a scent?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent was created by the fourth and last generation of the Guerlain family; from Wikipedia: &amp;#34;Jean-Paul Guerlain was the last family master perfumer. He created Guerlain&#x27;s classic men&#x27;s fragrances V&amp;eacute;tiver (1959) and Habit Rouge (1965). He also created Chant d&#x27;Arômes (1962), Chamade (1969), Nah&amp;eacute;ma (1979), Jardins de Bagatelle (1983), and Samsara (1989), as well as H&amp;eacute;ritage and Coriolan in the 1990s. Jean-Paul Guerlain retired in 2002, but continued to serve as advisor to his successor until 2010, when he was terminated after making a racist remark on French television regarding the inspiration for his scent Samsara.[1] With no heir from within the Guerlain family to take over, the role of master perfumer is no longer tied to family succession.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever the history and beliefs of this fine scent, it wears well on me and has for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert C. Ross&lt;br /&gt;July 2015</li>
    <li> I bought this item for one of my employees.  It was a employee of the month prize.  The employee was happy with the gift, but commented that the quality of the pefume was subpar.  He bought the same pefume from macys and the smell would last at least 7 more hours than the one I gave him.  I trust Amazon and I allways get great products, I was surprise to hear about the poor quality of this item.</li>
    <li> I have never found a better oriental male fragrance more perfect than this.&lt;br /&gt;Words are not enough to review it.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something out of this world, this is what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> I have been using Habit Rouge for years and it has become increasingly difficult to find in department stores so i was delighted to find it at Amazon.com. I am often asked &amp;#34;is that Habit Rouge you are wearing, where did you find it&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband..it&#x27;s a wonderful soft smelling spray that I find incredible appealing on him!  I first purchased Habit Rouge at a Duty Free Shop years ago and he has enjoyed it since then. as have I :)</li>
    <li> Great scent  I first found it in Paris some 20 years ago Its the only cologne I use stores stop carring it and had a hard time fininf it glad I looked on amazon</li>
    <li> It was mostly my fault for not purchasing my cologne in person, but I had been looking all over for vanilla-scented cologne, and Habit Rouge kept getting mentioned. However, this cologne has a very poignant woodsy smell, and it honestly reminded me of something a much older man would wear. It is not an awful smell, but it did not suit my personal chemistry, and I encourage you to try it at a retail store before you purchase it for a reduced price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> IMO this is THE male oriental, the one that all others must be judged by, and that most later examples of the genre are probably ripoffs of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Habit Rouge\\&quot; means \\&quot;red jacket,\\&quot; of the sort that fox hunters wear. This scent is supposed to make you feel like an aristocrat driving off for a week at the family chateau in a Bentley. It assuredly does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Guerlain apparently did here was to take the classic formula for a \\&quot;Russian leather\\&quot; -- leather, citrus, spices, amber and vanilla -- and add a few floral notes and a lot of sandalwood to turn it into an oriental -- or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like this, you should also get a scent that they aren&#x27;t selling on Amazon, so I suppose I can mention it here  -- Elsha 1776. Just type the word \\&quot;Elsha\\&quot; into your search engine and there you&#x27;ll find it. As far as I know, these people are making the last of the classic Russian leathers that can be bought at a reasonable price. I&#x27;ve had a huge 8-oz amber jug of this stuff on my dresser for years. \\&quot;Russian leather\\&quot; is a classic no amateur perfume historian should miss, since it&#x27;s the basis for so many other scents that have been derived from it -- including Gentleman, which I also review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some seem to think that Habit Rouge smells \\&quot;feminine.\\&quot; Well, someone on Basenotes pointed out that Sean Connery was a fan of this stuff, so that settles that. A woman CAN wear it, but she probably has to be a certain type -- early middle age, brainy, independent minded, but still relentlessly sexy, and proud of it all. Heck, my cousin even wears this at breakfast, but then when she was a kid she was a model.</li>
    <li> This is a classic scent from the fine perfume house of Guerlain. My wife introduced me to this back in 1983 or so. I ran out of mine a long long time ago and I&#x27;ve only ever been able to find it in the Caribbean on cruisers. But even then it&#x27;s becoming fewer and farther between being able to find any. They say they don&#x27;t have it leave France anymore. Or that&#x27;s what I was told. I know none of the major stores or chains here in the United States carry it. So I was extremely pleased when I one day just decided to check Amazon and lo and behold it was all over the place. I ordered mine and I got it in a day and a half. It was amazing how quickly it got here. It is the same scent that I know and love and remember. It&#x27;s definitely one of the classic older styles. But it is a fabulous, long lasting, and well worth the money, scent.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the best part, this is the least expensive I&#x27;ve ever seen it.</li>
    <li> REPLACED ONE I HAD USED UP</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know much about colognes and perfumes, but understand this is something of a &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; scent people used to wear back in the good old days. I got it because I was looking for something vanilla-scented, and the name Habit Rouge kept coming up in the forums I was trolling. It doesn&#x27;t really smell like vanilla, but it has a wonderful, powdery-floral scent, a little sweet, perhaps, but it is finely balanced, and I love the way it changes and deepens throughout the day. I get compliments on this all the time (mostly from old ladies, but still). Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Sticks are for a neighbor with Cerebral Palsy. He loves them. The Habit Rouge is the only Cologne I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I am an addict of de guerlain products and Habit Rouge is yet another de guerlain product that I enjoy using. The fragrance lasts all day long even when sprayed sparringly. Fresh scent that has the overtones of a baby powder</li>
    <li> This amazing perfume brings me 10 years back !! I love it thank you for the shipping speed A++</li>
    <li> understated. Does not scream or aggress the nose! and I have been using it for many years.</li>
    <li> Product arrived with a manufacturing defect which has rendered the product useless. Unfortunately Amazon&#x27;s rules forbid you from returning flammable materials leaving me with a bottle of liquid which I can&#x27;t get out nor can I get a refund for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize the manufacturing defect is not Amazon&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s a fault of the manufacturer. Hence the poor review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon needs to review their policy on returning products like this. The return page essentially says &amp;#34;You can&#x27;t return flammable items. Contact your local authorities regarding how to dispose of it.&amp;#34; and has one option, a button which says &amp;#34;Continue Shopping&amp;#34;. No way to pursue a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will include a picture as a warning of what bad QC can lead to. I dislike leaving bad reviews but this is unacceptable.</li>
    <li> We purchased this cologne from a different web site. If the product available here is of the same quality and price, you cannot go wrong in buying this cologne! A classic and elegant scent for men!</li>
    <li> Subtle scent.  Extremely pleasant fragrance with wonderful undertones.  No strange chemical notes.  One of my favorites for a long time.</li>
    <li> As a first time perfume purchase, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should go for this, but the reviews of Guerlain perfumes appeared to be positive in general. The reviews for this perfume were quite positive as well.&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead, check out the perfume reviews online and then make this purchase. The price is quite reasonable and it smells great! I&#x27;m definitely happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a real perfume, it looks like a lot of alcohol. Don&#x27;t stick on your skin for the rest of the day.</li>
    <li> floral yet leathery, great from morning to night</li>
    <li> I have used it for years.Light and refreshing with staying power.</li>
    <li> A beautiful fragrance from beginning to end!  Buy this and you will have made the right choice! 1965 was a very good year indeed. I am 47 years old as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this fragrance for years and this was a very good price.</li>
    <li> I have used Habit Rouge since its arrival. Its scent is delightful but never over powering. It can be worn with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hooked on HR for life.  Keep it coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best wishes,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Stanley Weiss</li>
    <li> Wears and projects well for me.  My introduction into the Oriental genre of the frag world.  Then too I&#x27;m a Guerlain fan and have not gone wrong with any of their scents up to this point, using also Vetiver and Vetiver Extreme</li>
    <li> I remember this cologne from the 1970&#x27;s when I was a young man and it was too &#x27;grown up&#x27; for me. That&#x27;s no longer a problem, and I was delighted to rediscover it during a recent trip to Paris. People&#x27;s senses operate differently and colognes smell differently on different people, so it doesn&#x27;t really matter what I think of it, but it suits me well. I get compliments on the scent, more than I&#x27;ve gotten from any cologne I&#x27;ve ever worn, the aroma will stay with you all day and through the evening, but it take a hour or so after putting it on for it to calm down. Pricing on Amazon was better than I found anywhere else, and the product arrived sooner than expected, as I&#x27;ve come to expect from Amazon.</li>
    <li> My son loved cologne. Thanks a million.</li>
    <li> Mi producto llego sin problemas de ningun tipo, el producto estaba totalmente sellado, lo recomiendo, excelente fragancia, muy agradable para para uso diario.</li>
    <li> I haved used this cologne exclusively since 1980.  I was very pleased by the price at Amazon.  I would recommend&lt;br /&gt;this product to anyone who likes subtle classic fragrances.</li>
    <li> Make it your own. Emit its heritage. It&#x27;s the most confident, unapologetic, secure man who wears this.  Orange blossom, leather, and personal musk seem to say: I&#x27;m here, I&#x27;m safe, I&#x27;m confident in myself, relax with me.</li>
    <li> I just received this late this past week. I was quite impressed with the first couple sprays after opening the package. Later, I wore it for the evening to dinner and on to a movie. From the initial citrus... not a strong citrus... to the cinnamon spicy and sweet dry down that reminded me of \\&quot;Red Hots\\&quot; candy, and on to the lingering and scrumptious Shailmar-resembling base, this is an amazing scent that I&#x27;ll wear, often. It leaves no doubt that it is \\&quot;Guerlain\\&quot;. I bought blind based upon positive reviews and based upon the creator&#x27;s name. Fantastic add to my slow but steadily growing collection! It is sweet, but not near so sweet as Dior Homme or Dreamer by Versace. I readily understand that women may enjoy wearing this fragrance, but from a male perspective it retains a positive masculinity. It bridges the genders exceedingly well. This is an addictive scent to me. I highly recommend!</li>
