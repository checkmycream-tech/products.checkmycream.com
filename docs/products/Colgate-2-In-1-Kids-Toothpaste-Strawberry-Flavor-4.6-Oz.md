      <li>Nice for boy&#x27;s bath set.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s runny when the room temperature is warm.</li>
      <li>This is a very strong berry smell and flavor.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent choice for toothpaste for my two young daughters.</li>
      <li>better than watermelon or mint for 4 and 5 year olds</li>
      <li>My kids love the taste and my nieces have even asked their mom to buy it after they tried it.</li>
      <li>My kid loves the watermelon better</li>
      <li>and I love brushing my teeth after all these years.  </li>
      <li>We waited till 3 to get this &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; toothpaste, to make sure she wasn&#x27;t swallowing it.  </li>
      <li>I was finally able to switch her over to toothpaste with this.</li>
      <li>I imagine most people would find it refreshing - he said it burns.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just ok with this toothpaste, the reason being, it is quite runny.  </li>

      <li>I love this stuff.</li>

      <li>Thx for making our mornings better.</li>
      <li>, my kids love it.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
      <li>Fine workmanship Color is very comfortable</li>
      <li>Brought this for my 6 yr old and she was happy.</li>
      <li>also like the bottle, why I find easy to use (no screw-on, just a snap cap).</li>
      <li>so I guess it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>The Tom&#x27;s toothpaste was more mild.</li>
      <li>Thank you for making it available online.</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste it leaves her breathe smelling fresh</li>
      <li>my 3 and 6 yr old look forward to brushing their teeth since this toothpaste tastes to good.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure this is a good toothpaste as kids are just fussy about things for however long.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s more effective than not brushing, so on a personal level it gets 5 stars.</li>
      <li>it have my teeth clean</li>
      <li>Both my daughter and I like it very much!</li>
      <li>This Strawberry flavor is fresh and more mature.</li>
      <li>and it have my breath fresh.</li>
      <li>, A lot of kids toothpaste does not give them fresh breath in my opinion</li>
      <li>brushing teeth a fun activity</li>
      <li>better way for a complete oral clean.&lt;br /&gt;makes</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel right to brush my teeth with it.</li>
      <li>Very very gooey.  </li>
      <li>Kids didn&#x27;t like it so much at first</li>
      <li>Thanks Colgate!</li>
      <li>Before it was baking soda and hurry and spit out the mouth wash as fast as I could!</li>
      <li>My 4.5 year old and 2 year old both love this</li>
      <li>Less is way better than not using any!</li>
      <li>My toddler absolutely HATES the taste and refuses to use it after the first try</li>
      <li>This one has a little crisp &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; that I don&#x27;t think he liked.  </li>
      <li>I think the taste is a bit too strong for kids, will give it a try again later.</li>
      <li>As described and arrived fast.</li>
      <li>My dad didn&#x27;t brush his teeth much and had very rotten teeth as I recall.</li>
      <li>because I don&#x27;t think this toothpaste is actually quite as effective as the last minty toothpaste I tried (Sensodyne).</li>
      <li>I also often put more on the brush after the first little bit is gone now.</li>
      <li>Granted, I am sure this may be a personal preference thing, but it really was a big miss for both of my kids who were looking for an alternative to those minty style kids toothpastes which they feel are &amp;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my fault for not reading the ingredients, but this toothpaste is full of chemicals and red dye.</li>
      <li>The concept of both a mouthwash and toothpaste in one sounded intriguing, but in the end, this simply did not work well.  </li>
      <li>My kids love this flavor and the way it tastes when they brush their teeth everyday.  </li>
      <li>Finally, a toothpaste that my 3-year old granddaughter likes to use and doesn&#x27;t complain about it being too hot!</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no creativity in toothpaste flavors, for all the money they spend on New and Improved and advertising.</li>
      <li>3-year old daughter loves the taste!  </li>
      <li>My 7.5 year old dislikes minty (spicy!)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 24 years old, but I rarely brushed my teeth as a kid or teenager because I wasn&#x27;t really disciplined to do so.</li>
      <li>The bubblegum and wild berry flavors are just to candy-like.  </li>
      <li>My four year old loves it</li>
      <li>My 3 yr old loves the taste.</li>
      <li>I am an adult who hates mint flavored anything -</li>
      <li>I bought it for my granddaughter than ten years, She loves because it whitens and removes stains your teeth fast.</li>
      <li>I have a child that is sensitive to mint toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>It still has sodium laurel sulfate which I think is used to make it more foamy and less runny, but has the side effect, as it does in all toothpaste it&#x27;s used in, of making food taste odd after you brush.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My chiled didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> My four year old loves it but when I tried it, it feels like I&#x27;m brushing my teeth with sugar... It doesn&#x27;t feel right to brush my teeth with it.</li>
    <li> way expensive for this quality. Does not worth a single buck.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this toothpaste - shes 4 - I love this toothpaste it leaves her breathe smelling fresh, A lot of kids toothpaste does not give them fresh breath in my opinion</li>
    <li> My child loves this stuff. I do however have one small quibble and that is the pink dye in this stuff is not easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste my granddaughters will use.</li>
    <li> My kids love this flavor and the way it tastes when they brush their teeth everyday.  Makes motivating them to brush a lot easier every day.</li>
    <li> Great flavor. Get this for beginners.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 24 years old, but I rarely brushed my teeth as a kid or teenager because I wasn&#x27;t really disciplined to do so. My dad didn&#x27;t brush his teeth much and had very rotten teeth as I recall. So a few years ago I finally became a \\&quot;big kid\\&quot; and started brushing my teeth every day. So yes, basically I&#x27;m a kid, and I have never liked the taste of mint. This is what I have used from the beginning. I find that if I try switching to regular mint toothpaste, I just stop brushing my teeth every day because I dread the taste. Sensodyne left an awful aftertaste in my mouth, too. I don&#x27;t even notice the taste of the kids toothpaste anymore, but at least I don&#x27;t feel negatively toward it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the bottle, why I find easy to use (no screw-on, just a snap cap). I saw some complained about the toothpaste being runny. It&#x27;s runny when the room temperature is warm. During winter, I find the toothpaste is less runny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually want to give this 4.5 stars, if it were possible... because I don&#x27;t think this toothpaste is actually quite as effective as the last minty toothpaste I tried (Sensodyne). But it&#x27;s more effective than not brushing, so on a personal level it gets 5 stars.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this toothpaste and when your kids loves the toothpaste then the fight of brushing their teeth isn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
    <li> My 4.5 year old and 2 year old both love this and I couldn&#x27;t ask for more! They like the flavor and bright color - I just like that they enjoy brushing their teeth!</li>
    <li> We love this toothpaste! My kids love the taste and my nieces have even asked their mom to buy it after they tried it.</li>
    <li> I have a child that is sensitive to mint toothpaste.  This was a good alternative.  The only downside is a couple of my kids don&#x27;t care for the flavor of this toothpaste, so I have to keep both types on hand.</li>
    <li> I hate hate hate toothpaste! I was down to using baking soda or plain water. Not the best way to protect your teeth. I decided to try this and I&#x27;m almost a senior! I love this stuff. I am laughing because someone said it is so runny. Well, lol, yes it is! Use less. Less is way better than not using any! I actually found a toothbrush that vibrates and this toothpaste and I love brushing my teeth after all these years.  Before it was baking soda and hurry and spit out the mouth wash as fast as I could! I also often put more on the brush after the first little bit is gone now. Get the kids the orajel vibrating brush to go with this!  The kids will not want to quit brushing the teeth! I sure hope Amazon doesn&#x27;t let anyone figure out who I am!</li>
    <li> Tough to find a flavor our daughter likes and she likes this one.</li>
    <li> I am an adult who hates mint flavored anything - especially tooth paste so this was a great find on Amazon. It is just a bit more expensive then tube type tooth paste and you have to be a bit careful putting it on your brush as it can squirt out and is a semi liquid gel, but these are minor problems.</li>
    <li> 3-year old daughter loves the taste!  We waited till 3 to get this &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; toothpaste, to make sure she wasn&#x27;t swallowing it.  We used the gentler, swallow-safe pastes before this.</li>
    <li> My daughter likes the flavor but she does struggle a bit to get the toothpaste out. It requires a bit of hand strength.</li>
    <li> This is a very strong berry smell and flavor. One kids loves it and one hates it so I guess it&#x27;s fine. As described and arrived fast.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my fault for not reading the ingredients, but this toothpaste is full of chemicals and red dye. Don&#x27;t believe me? Compare it to Crest Pro-Health Stages Jake And The Neverland Pirates Kid&#x27;s Toothpaste.</li>
    <li> My three year-old didn&#x27;t like the taste.  Ultimately, he did like Silly Strawberry fluoride toothpaste made by Tom&#x27;s.  This one has a little crisp &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; that I don&#x27;t think he liked.  I imagine most people would find it refreshing - he said it burns.  The Tom&#x27;s toothpaste was more mild.</li>
    <li> I think the taste is a bit too strong for kids, will give it a try again later.</li>
    <li> we have re-purchased this flavor multiple times.  better than watermelon or mint for 4 and 5 year olds</li>
    <li> Brought this for my 6 yr old and she was happy. She said mummy it have my teeth clean and it have my breath fresh. Her teeth was&lt;br /&gt;clean and white after using it and she felt happy.</li>
    <li> Good !and smells great!</li>
    <li> My toddler absolutely HATES the taste and refuses to use it after the first try</li>
    <li> Finally, a toothpaste that my 3-year old granddaughter likes to use and doesn&#x27;t complain about it being too hot!</li>
    <li> Fine workmanship Color is very comfortable</li>
    <li> This is an excellent choice for toothpaste for my two young daughters. They love the flavor of it, and the bottle is the perfect size for their hands to be able to brush their teeth on their own.</li>
    <li> Great for kids who don&#x27;t like mint</li>
    <li> My 5 year old loves this toothpast but it is often hard to provide.  Thank you for making it available online.</li>
    <li> Not a real fan, this toothpaste was very runny and difficult to keep on the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Nice for boy&#x27;s bath set. good choice</li>
    <li> Daughter loves the flavor. I was finally able to switch her over to toothpaste with this.</li>
    <li> My kids have a hard time with toothpaste it&#x27;s &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; they say. I even tried flavored pastes like orange but they still protested. even though they like having their teeth brushed. They LOVE this stuff, no mentholation at all, it&#x27;s a liquidy gel that tastes great.</li>
    <li> My Kids love this toothpaste! They say it tastes good, and we don&#x27;t fight to brush teeth. Win/win. Thanks Colgate!</li>
    <li> It seems that 99% of toothpastes are mint flavored. There&#x27;s no creativity in toothpaste flavors, for all the money they spend on New and Improved and advertising. We also use Tom&#x27;s strawberry for the kids, but it&#x27;s a bit hard to find. This strawberry flavor is stronger and peppier, almost peppery. Kids didn&#x27;t like it so much at first but now they do. It still has sodium laurel sulfate which I think is used to make it more foamy and less runny, but has the side effect, as it does in all toothpaste it&#x27;s used in, of making food taste odd after you brush. Wish they would stop using that stuff.</li>
    <li> Great taste, my kids love it.&lt;br /&gt;the better way for a complete oral clean.&lt;br /&gt;makes brushing teeth a fun activity</li>
    <li> My kid loves the watermelon better but I&#x27;m sure this is a good toothpaste as kids are just fussy about things for however long.</li>
    <li> My younger son loves it</li>
    <li> yummy flavor for your kids. my 3 and 6 yr old look forward to brushing their teeth since this toothpaste tastes to good. it&#x27;s like a night time dessert before they go to bed. great buy.</li>
    <li> I agree with others, this stuff is awesome. My son loves the taste, &amp; brushes his teeth more. I plan to order tons more.</li>
    <li> Love it ... I&#x27;m allergic to mint so I need childrens toothpast.  The bubblegum and wild berry flavors are just to candy-like.  This Strawberry flavor is fresh and more mature.</li>
    <li> Brushing was everyday battle with my 3 year old until I found this toothpaste . Thx for making our mornings better.</li>
    <li> My 3 yr old loves the taste. We tried other brands and flavors but this was a winner.</li>
    <li> My 7.5 year old dislikes minty (spicy!) toothpaste. She loves this one though!</li>
    <li> My son is extrememly picky and doesn&#x27;t mind the taste of this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just ok with this toothpaste, the reason being, it is quite runny.  So be prepared if you&#x27;re getting this for your kids, that they will make a mess with it.  It&#x27;s hard not to make a mess with it because it just drips off the brush after you put it on. So beware.  My kids seem to like the taste, but I&#x27;m just not sure I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste!  Of course, my kid will only use the watermelon.</li>
    <li> my kids did not like the taste of this toothpaste. they prefer the watermelon flavor of the same brand.</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and I like it very much!</li>
    <li> Very very gooey.  Makes quite a mess (especially with my four year old -- but even my 7 and 9 year old have a hard time controlling the mess!).</li>
    <li> The concept of both a mouthwash and toothpaste in one sounded intriguing, but in the end, this simply did not work well.  For starters, it&#x27;s runny, so it would simply run off of my kids brush.  Then worse, it had an almost icing-like taste of chemical strawberry; simply awful.  Granted, I am sure this may be a personal preference thing, but it really was a big miss for both of my kids who were looking for an alternative to those minty style kids toothpastes which they feel are &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess we will just keep looking.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my granddaughter than ten years, She loves because it whitens and removes stains your teeth fast. also has a very pleasant taste.&lt;br /&gt;the keep buying for the excellent results.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
