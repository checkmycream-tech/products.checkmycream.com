      <li>I love this perfume.  </li>
      <li>and it smells pretty good in the jar-</li>
      <li>this is for you fast delivery and good price too</li>
      <li>Not too strong just a slight lingering most wonderful &amp;#34;true hippie sweat&amp;#34</li>
      <li>I love this scent and the solid perfume is a great way to have patchouli around.</li>
      <li>but the sent fades very quickly on the skin</li>
      <li>I am so happy I was able to find this fragrance in a solid.  </li>
      <li>The odors not as strong as I was led to believe by reviews.</li>
      <li>I do love patchouli and this is very nice with its wooden casement.</li>
      <li>Barely a scent of musky amber, but not a hint of patchouli to my rather experienced nose...    </li>
      <li>Is smooth and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Really enjoy the container-</li>
      <li>I love patchouli and wished this was a fresh item, not like it had been sitting on a shelf forever.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!!!</li>
      <li>THINK IT IS WORTH WHAT I PAID FOR IT!</li>
      <li>Nice, but not a heavy Patchouli.  </li>
      <li>does fade quickly though.</li>
      <li>The jar is very pretty.  </li>
      <li>This is a wonderful perfume and long lasting if you like Patchouli</li>
      <li>The scent is nice, but the solid perfume looks nothing like in the picture.  </li>
      <li>I found it useful as a substitute for a sachet packet.</li>
      <li>THE OTHER REVIEWS WERE GOOD</li>
      <li>The Patchouli Solid Perfume is a naturally attractive scent, and its effect on women is palpable!  </li>
      <li>Because this is an oil-based solid, it doesn&#x27;t wash off easily, which is nice if you&#x27;re like me and perfumes don&#x27;t seem to last.  </li>
      <li>The item looked lovely from the outside</li>
      <li>The jar is cute, but tiny.</li>
      <li>I was expecting kind of a wet, mulchy forest smell and instead got what I think smells like a moldy basement.</li>
      <li>Will be back to buy more.  </li>
      <li>The hand carved wooden jar is lovely.</li>
      <li>The solid perfume smells wonderful and is long lasting.</li>
      <li>The rosewood jar is a slightly off scent with the patchouli, but once you can smell JUST the patchouli, it&#x27;s nice.</li>
      <li>The packaging is small, elegant and unique.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d never smelled Patchouli before and can&#x27;t really say I like it.</li>
      <li>Tried gently warming jar, but it did not help.  </li>
      <li>To call this thimble sized dollop a &#x27;jar&#x27; is a bit much.</li>
      <li>I really like this jar of perfume.  </li>
      <li>Take a good look at that chain in the photo, it is very very small.  </li>
      <li>bought larger jars of this in the past, but the perfume and the jar was great.  </li>
      <li>Seems to last a fairly long time (6-8 hours) and for the price is really a nice item.</li>
      <li>I was willing to get past the size issue if the scent was good, but unfortunately there was nothing good about this product.  </li>
      <li>Just an older hippie who loves this scent.</li>
      <li>It comes in a cute little container you can throw in your purse and take it anywhere too</li>
      <li>the jar is very lovely, just wish it was a little bigger.</li>
      <li>the container is pretty small, but other than that it smells nice and the container is very original, pretty enough for a present.</li>
      <li>but inside was a dried up waxy stuff with a rancid smell, not the lovely fragrance of patchouli.  </li>
      <li>The scent is deep and rich and the solid form seems to soak into my skin and blend with my body chemistry.  </li>
      <li>Some find this scent to be a natural aphrodisiac, and IMHO, I tend to believe it, as well!  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love my little wooden sachet container!</li>
      <li>Their stock is old.</li>
      <li>Enjoy the little carved box, because there is nothing inside!</li>
      <li>I dab some on my wrists and inner elbows and behind ears and give off such a lovely fragrance.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is fantastic and she said the little jar was the cutest little jar she had seen.</li>

<li> This jar is way too small to have any real use after the small amount is gone.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> nice lite aroma of a usually strong scent. not completely overpowering. does fade quickly though.</li>
    <li> The Patchouli Solid Perfume is a naturally attractive scent, and its effect on women is palpable!  Truly a wonderful fragrance.  Some find this scent to be a natural aphrodisiac, and IMHO, I tend to believe it, as well!  To present this in a wonderful turned Rosewood jar makes this a gift that is unique, beautiful and to be enjoyed by all.  Place it in a sunny window spot and see how its fragrance fills the room with its aromatherapeutic scent!    A Must Buy!!!</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to trying this and received it as a Christmas present but it hardly smells like anything and does not last. When I opened it it seemed to have a darker top layer on it. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s suppose too look like but either way I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> Happy repeat customer. Love the fragrance and love that I&#x27;m able to order it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> this item smelled like wax. could be my nose but I think not. I received a bar of Patchouli soap from the Austin soap co. Austin Tx. really loved that smell. I expected the same smell, was not in this jar...sorry. I sent this back for a refund.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 and one looks discolored old and previously used.</li>
    <li> Smells funky, very solid.  Seems ancient and a little rancid.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality; great diversion from the normal sprays. I&#x27;d never smelled Patchouli before and can&#x27;t really say I like it. I was expecting kind of a wet, mulchy forest smell and instead got what I think smells like a moldy basement. However, the product itself is very nice. The packaging is beautiful.</li>
    <li> It has a wonderful pure patchouli scent. If you are a patchouli lover then you will like this solid perfume.  The hand carved wooden jar is lovely.</li>
    <li> Enjoy the little carved box, because there is nothing inside! Barely a scent of musky amber, but not a hint of patchouli to my rather experienced nose...    How do you hide the fragrance of patchouli? {:&gt;{</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful perfume and long lasting if you like Patchouli this is for you fast delivery and good price too</li>
    <li> OMG. THIS IS SOOOOO SMALL MINE DIDNT EVEN HAVE THE TOP!!! I THOUGHT IS WOULD BE GREAT WHERAS THE OTHER REVIEWS WERE GOOD BUT IM NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH IT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SO I ORDERED TWO ONE TO GIVE AWAY BUT ID BE WAY TO EMBERISSED TO GIVE IT AS A GIFT. IM SORRY TO SAY BUT I DONT THINK IT IS WORTH WHAT I PAID FOR IT!</li>
    <li> This item is very small in size. I also do not like the scent. It smells like cedar wood, not Patchouli.</li>
    <li> I know one star means I hated the product, can&#x27;t say &amp;#34;hate&amp;#34; but the one I received was obviously old, the perfume was dry and had absolutely no fragrance.  I am a long time patchouli user and have a solid perfume from another company and will stick with that.  This was a disappointment and I returned it.</li>
    <li> I put the container in my lingerie drawer and the scent still lingers.  I found it useful as a substitute for a sachet packet.</li>
    <li> Just an older hippie who loves this scent.</li>
    <li> The item looked lovely from the outside but inside was a dried up waxy stuff with a rancid smell, not the lovely fragrance of patchouli.  I was very disappointed and would not recommend this item.  Their stock is old.</li>
    <li> The scent is nice, but the solid perfume looks nothing like in the picture.  It&#x27;s brown and dry looking.  Please send me a replacement that looks like the one pictured.</li>
    <li> Nasty coating on the top that shouldnt be there. I have purchased a bunch of these and i have never seen this crusty coating before.</li>
    <li> I bought this for someone but she says she loves it. It comes in a cute little container you can throw in your purse and take it anywhere too</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  A little goes a long way .. I dab some on my wrists and inner elbows and behind ears and give off such a lovely fragrance.  The only thing is the jar is so very tiny and that was a little disappointing ... the jar is very lovely, just wish it was a little bigger. I placed it on my cologne/perfume tray.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even want to give away my signature scent. Lots of compliments, I buy dozens of these. Love it.</li>
    <li> if you like solid perfumes, yes. Also, box is beautiful and scent is rich and true.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my girlfriend about a week ago.  Last night she asked me to smell her wrist!  I asked,  &amp;quot;What&#x27;s that?&amp;quot;  She said, the Patchouli you bought me!  My response was, that is definitely not Patchouli !!!  I have purchased this product for her a few times now, so I&#x27;m use to the scent.  I think someone made a mistake in packaging. This will be going back!</li>
    <li> This disappointed me.  The solid perfume seems to be shop worn.  I could not smell it after 5 minutes. Not the patchouli I am used to.  Very hard to get any of it to rub on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have bought larger jars of this in the past, but the perfume and the jar was great.  This jar is way too small to have any real use after the small amount is gone.  I have used it three times, but the perfume aroma is missing.  Tried gently warming jar, but it did not help.  The jar is cute, but tiny. I think perhaps I received an old, stale jar.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. If you love patchouli do not be afraid to get this. No buyers remorse here!</li>
    <li> I will be returning this item today.  I&#x27;m not sure what is the problem with it, but it just smells rank.  Not at all like Patchouli.  There is not much smell to it except for a rank, old oil smell.  As if it was very old and had gone bad.  I must say though that the lid was not fastened well, it almost came off in my hand as I opened the box.  There was a dark film on the solid perfume, whether intentionally or not, possibly to preserve it?  Or was it exposed to air?  Anyway, I scraped off the film but the perfume was still rank smelling below that.  I love patchouli and wished this was a fresh item, not like it had been sitting on a shelf forever.  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not good at all sorry</li>
    <li> I love the jar that it comes in- and it smells pretty good in the jar- but the sent fades very quickly on the skin and I had to use a lot to last the day (and it didn&#x27;t even last that long)</li>
    <li> I am sorry to say that this has no real discernible smell of patchouli. I was looking forward to getting it because I was all out, but the small odor that comes from this is not a good smell.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The solid perfume smells wonderful and is long lasting. The packaging is small, elegant and unique. I&#x27;m going to buy a few for gifts to give.</li>
    <li> Patchouli takes me back to a time of blue jeans and fli flops.  I am so happy I was able to find this fragrance in a solid.  Not to mention the hand carved rosewood jar is a jewel in and of it&#x27;s self!!</li>
    <li> I was jazzed to get this until I learned hand made from India meant slave labor. I hope I&#x27;ve heard wrong. The odors not as strong as I was led to believe by reviews. Maybe it&#x27;s the \\&quot;slave labor\\&quot; thought. Maybe it&#x27;s my nose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a quality patchouli perfume, and I think I&#x27;ve found it. The carved rosewood jar is a plus.</li>
    <li> my boyfriend is not a fan of this smell.. but even he liked it... i can rub some on an last all day.  not to mention the beautiful container it came it</li>
    <li> Because this is an oil-based solid, it doesn&#x27;t wash off easily, which is nice if you&#x27;re like me and perfumes don&#x27;t seem to last.  The rosewood jar is a slightly off scent with the patchouli, but once you can smell JUST the patchouli, it&#x27;s nice.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy the container- fragrance is just what i expected. Only thing i did not know as I had not purchased this style of product is there was a thin wax coating over the solid perfume....it took me a couple times of using it before i figured that out and then of course the perfume fragrance was more noticable.</li>
    <li> Take a good look at that chain in the photo, it is very very small.  To call this thimble sized dollop a &#x27;jar&#x27; is a bit much. You could probably fit two of these in a shot glass!  I like the scent, I like the presentation (albeit miniaturized), but for thirteen bucks i was disappointed in the quantity.  I</li>
    <li> was expecting a larger jar but it was very tiny a little disappointing but smelled good also has a tiny amount of perfume.</li>
    <li> I really like this jar of perfume.  The scent is deep and rich and the solid form seems to soak into my skin and blend with my body chemistry.  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I do love patchouli and this is very nice with its wooden casement. Is smooth and easy to apply. My cats for some reason like to push it off the dresser and then knock it around. I explained it&#x27;s not a cat toy but they don&#x27;t listen so I had to wedge somewhere they can&#x27;t do that. Maybe the scent attracts them too.</li>
    <li> The scent is perfect and the tiny jar is lovely. I can see myself collecting more of these to keep at work and home.</li>
    <li> This item is very nice ... with a screw on wooden lid and jar.  Would make a nice inexpensive gift.  It&#x27; has a definite Sandlewood mixed with Patchouli scent.  Nice, but not a heavy Patchouli.  Seems to last a fairly long time (6-8 hours) and for the price is really a nice item.</li>
    <li> the container is pretty small, but other than that it smells nice and the container is very original, pretty enough for a present. different and pretty for someone who likes out of ordinary stuff. three stars because of the size</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when I opened this &amp;#34;jar&amp;#34; and found a nasty, discolored, coating on top and a smell that did not resemble Patchouli at all.  In addition, the size of this is not what I expected - very very small - probably three fingers high. I was willing to get past the size issue if the scent was good, but unfortunately there was nothing good about this product.  I would return it, but the cost of sending back doesn&#x27;t make sense with the price of the product.  Very disappointed and I would suggest to others to do more research on the seller/product before purchasing.</li>
    <li> Fast and great product for price!</li>
    <li> My wife loved this gift. The fragrance is fantastic and she said the little jar was the cutest little jar she had seen.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my little wooden sachet container! The Patchouli smell is absolutely Wonderful! Not too strong just a slight lingering most wonderful &amp;#34;true hippie sweat&amp;#34; smell. THANKS &amp; GREAT JOB. From one &amp;#34;aging hippie to another.&amp;#34;  ( - :</li>
    <li> This product is great.  Love the smell.  Will last a long time.  The jar is very pretty.  Will be back to buy more.  Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> I love this scent and the solid perfume is a great way to have patchouli around. The hand carved box is a lovely touch.</li>
