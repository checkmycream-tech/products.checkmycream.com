      <li>Worked ok, no miracle cure for blemishes.</li>
      <li>The label on top claimed the product was from 2014, however, the label underneath said it was from 2010.</li>
      <li>This does have a strong, woody scent, but I rather enjoyed it.</li>
      <li>I love how easy this roll-on tea tree oil blemish stick is.</li>
      <li>Tea tree oil and with hazel is awesome for clearing skin up, and this little package is so easy to use and effective.</li>
      <li>The oil was too strong, the smell</li>
      <li>I guess if you have only mild acne, tea tree oil may be effective for you, but otherwise it isn&#x27;t very effective.</li>
      <li>shrinks pimples quickly !</li>
      <li>My teen son now uses it and is happy with it also</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, so was worried about trying this, but loved it.  </li>
      <li>I originally ordered the 100% tea tree oil from this brand and got this blemish roller as a freebie.</li>
      <li>I liked the smell and it went on easily and dried nicely, though.</li>
      <li>Yes, it has a bit of an odor when applying, but dissipates quickly.  </li>
      <li>She washes her face with mild soap and then rolls on the tee tree oil.  </li>
      <li>this is portable quick fix kids like it</li>
      <li>This works great on healing acne quickly using more natural ingredients then other products on the market.</li>
      <li>Great helping me clear facial blemishes.</li>
      <li>Also, it ran out pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>It was pretty soothing to my skin, however, I found it to be most effective if you roll it on several times a day (especially for blemishes that are tender and swollen).</li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>The first couple of times she used it</li>
      <li>The roll on allows for targeting the exact spot with drying out surrounding area.</li>
      <li>well Im back to buy more after trying this roll on stick</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used everything there is for many years with varying results but this one works quickly to resolve blemishes without all the side effects other substances can have like over drying the skin and bleaching out fabrics when accidentally applied.  </li>
      <li>Within a day, I noticed some red spots that I feared were turning into blemishes had gone away (after being there for many days) and just a quick swipe on my problem areas has kept my skin clear.  </li>
      <li>It does have a strong odor when initially applied, but it passes.</li>
      <li>I can keep it handy in my purse and use it whenever since it dries fast and doesn&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I have been using tea tree oil for ages for my skin, and this roller ball applicator made my life so much easier.</li>
      <li>I hope continuous use will rid of the scars I&#x27;ve been getting from my acne as well, but I would much rather use this natural/homeopathic route to curing the acne than RX/prescriptions.</li>
      <li>I use it on any blemish I have and it drys up FAST and goes</li>
      <li>It tingles (sometimes burns) when applied, but that subsides fairly fast.</li>
      <li>It dries/tightens the skin, and I have noticed that my skin looks much clearer.</li>
      <li>Dries them out very well without over drying my skin.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>This did absolutely nothing for my acne.</li>
      <li>I use it every other day and it feels good and softens my facial skin.</li>
      <li>I ran out before I could measure the full potential of the product.  </li>
      <li>If you have acne I would highly suggest this product.</li>
      <li>, how easy it is to use and dont need to mess around with the slimy oils.  </li>
      <li>I originally received this product as a gift for ordering other products through Herbal Authority.  </li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t really do a difference to the visible dark marks, but it does however help prevent a lot of ingrown hairs from flaring up if you use it right after you shave or use clippers.</li>
      <li>A non-drying, chemical-free way to clear up pimples.</li>
      <li>THE BLEMISHES STARTED TO CLEAR UP WITHIN 2 OR 3 DAYS.</li>
      <li>and so far it hasn&#x27;t returned.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
      <li>and it has not dried out her skin.  </li>
      <li>it did not dried it out</li>
      <li>plus it didnt irritate my sensitive skin</li>
      <li>WOW is all I can say.  </li>
      <li>My 13 year old daughter was beginning to break out on her forehead, so I tried this.&lt;br /&gt;Dried up her acne</li>
      <li>, she said it tingled, but no other issues</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> AMAZING! This combination in this product is perfect for acne, and I love that it&#x27;s in a roller ball feature! I have been using this and Now Foods: Tea Tree Oil, 4 oz  and my horrible acne that I have been getting is disappearing before my eyes, and it&#x27;s only been a couple of days! I hope continuous use will rid of the scars I&#x27;ve been getting from my acne as well, but I would much rather use this natural/homeopathic route to curing the acne than RX/prescriptions.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as a gift... they loved it!</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t help my acne at all</li>
    <li> They love it instead of dragging proactive over night this is portable quick fix kids like it moms happy.  Yeah</li>
    <li> Best acne roll on, will be buying more, again!</li>
    <li> Check the experation date! I received mine 2-26-15 with an expiration date of 2-2015. Pretty disappointed, money was refunded and product thrown away.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic!  It helps with pimples as well as bug bites.  I have run out and bought a second tube!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using tea tree oil for ages for my skin, and this roller ball applicator made my life so much easier. Tea tree oil and with hazel is awesome for clearing skin up, and this little package is so easy to use and effective.</li>
    <li> This does have a strong, woody scent, but I rather enjoyed it. It is not a lasting scent by any means so don&#x27;t let that deter you from buying this product. It was pretty soothing to my skin, however, I found it to be most effective if you roll it on several times a day (especially for blemishes that are tender and swollen).</li>
    <li> Trust me I&#x27;ve tried every product for acne/blemishes and this stuff works if you use it everyday. I&#x27;d choose this over proactive anyday.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my acne. It was just okay. The smell was not overpowering. It&#x27;s in a convenient tube but I was sort of worried about contamination because it&#x27;s a rollerball, so whatever was on your skin is getting rolled back into the fluid. I bought one but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> BUY ELSEWHERE!&lt;br /&gt;While using this product, I notice part of the label was coming off. I noticed another label underneath. The label on top claimed the product was from 2014, however, the label underneath said it was from 2010. I&#x27;ve gotten this product before (obviously from a RELIABLE seller) and it worked wonders. This time, nothing. Might have something to do with it being 5 years old... very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she now swears by it.  I tried it on pop up blemishes and it is works surprisingly well.  I&#x27;ve used everything there is for many years with varying results but this one works quickly to resolve blemishes without all the side effects other substances can have like over drying the skin and bleaching out fabrics when accidentally applied.  Will buy this for years to come.</li>
    <li> I originally received this product as a gift for ordering other products through Herbal Authority.  WOW is all I can say.  I use it on any blemish I have and it drys up FAST and goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT!!!!!  I discovered that it also cures bug bites, chiggers AND my son&#x27;s molluscum contagiosum!  I spent over $600 dollars on medicine (two rounds of Aldara at $300 a pop!).  It wasn&#x27;t working.  So I had my blemish stick one night and thought what can it hurt?  The bumps are GONE within a month of treatment and he has had them for two years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is I&#x27;m telling everyone about this stuff.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Cleared up my pimples and!!! my dark spots seem to be fading..slow but in the process! I fell in love and ordered six more! Highly recommended!  It has an umm smell..not too bad..i personally love the tea tree smell so..my boyfriend complains about the tast on my face A LOT..so id say it as a bad taste but who cares.it works! haha Im sooo happy plus it didnt irritate my sensitive skin -nor it did not dried it out</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I have never struggled with acne until my 30s. All the products I have tried dried my skin out. This is a simple roll on and works wonders!! My teen son now uses it and is happy with it also</li>
    <li> I love it!!! Definitely feels like it&#x27;s doing the job. I use this with the tea tree oil lotion from the body shop! Amazing!</li>
    <li> Worked ok, no miracle cure for blemishes.</li>
    <li> I use it every other day and it feels good and softens my facial skin. It does have a odor that takes getting used too.</li>
    <li> THE BLEMISHES STARTED TO CLEAR UP WITHIN 2 OR 3 DAYS. GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tea tree roll on product. Works well!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything for me. Also, it ran out pretty quickly. I guess if you have only mild acne, tea tree oil may be effective for you, but otherwise it isn&#x27;t very effective.</li>
    <li> Great helping me clear facial blemishes.</li>
    <li> My 13 year old daughter was beginning to break out on her forehead, so I tried this.&lt;br /&gt;Dried up her acne and so far it hasn&#x27;t returned.&lt;br /&gt;She applies every night religiously.</li>
    <li> I love how easy this roll-on tea tree oil blemish stick is. I can keep it handy in my purse and use it whenever since it dries fast and doesn&#x27;t make a mess. I also find the scent to be rather pleasant.</li>
    <li> It made my skin break out. Tea tree oil never did that to me before so I think. It was another ingredient in it.</li>
    <li> Works! Love this product!</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE!!! this product!!! Wish I knew about it earlier!!! After using this product in one day, my acne drastically minimized!!! For all my acne sufferers out there!! You need to try this! Its a miricle in a bottle!</li>
    <li> Gave this to my daughter and she is happy with it. It is a good roller ball and goes on easily. Has a pleasant scent and it did not cause her any sensitivity.</li>
    <li> This works great on healing acne quickly using more natural ingredients then other products on the market.</li>
    <li> not so good i dont like it plus it stinks and doesnt work</li>
    <li> Wish it lasted longer. Great product over all.</li>
    <li> well Im back to buy more after trying this roll on stick, how easy it is to use and dont need to mess around with the slimy oils.  Works great on raised scars too, I had this ant bite scar on my foot  and I started trying it on there, and with in a couple of days it started itching and its been slowly going away.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a little while, but it does feel like it is working. It tingles (sometimes burns) when applied, but that subsides fairly fast. It dries/tightens the skin, and I have noticed that my skin looks much clearer. I didn&#x27;t really have acne to begin with, just a few discolorations and a small pimple every once and awhile</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, so was worried about trying this, but loved it.  Within a day, I noticed some red spots that I feared were turning into blemishes had gone away (after being there for many days) and just a quick swipe on my problem areas has kept my skin clear.  Yes, it has a bit of an odor when applying, but dissipates quickly.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This stuff will remove a topical blemish overnight. The roll on allows for targeting the exact spot with drying out surrounding area.</li>
    <li> This did absolutely nothing for my acne. I liked the smell and it went on easily and dried nicely, though.</li>
    <li> It really works! Great price at amazon and works really fast on my blemishes. I used to buy the Burts Bees blemish stick but ever since i tried this i won&#x27;t ever change it again!</li>
    <li> A non-drying, chemical-free way to clear up pimples.</li>
    <li> Great for acne ! shrinks pimples quickly !</li>
    <li> I am so happy so have found this product. It has worked wonders for my acne. I don&#x27;t apply it all over just on spots that seem to be forming. Dries them out very well without over drying my skin. I originally ordered the 100% tea tree oil from this brand and got this blemish roller as a freebie. The oil was too strong, the smell and it burned my skin. If you have acne I would highly suggest this product.</li>
    <li> I used it on the blemished portions of my jaws, at least 3x daily.  It did not burn and I actually liked the smell.  It made me relaxed to the point of being sleepy :-)  I ran out before I could measure the full potential of the product.  I will order again and see if it will dry up my whiteheads.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
    <li> I love this product along with the tea tree oil soap it clears the blemishes off your face in no time.</li>
    <li> Great product! My girlfriend loves it</li>
    <li> I use this product before bed. It works well and you can see the difference within hours.</li>
    <li> Love the glass bottle; works great as a refillable aswell</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughters blemishes and it works! It does have a strong odor when initially applied, but it passes.</li>
    <li> I have a few ingrown hair scars and acne scars on my face so I was hoping it would help. Although it makes your skin feel refreshed it doesn&#x27;t really do a difference to the visible dark marks, but it does however help prevent a lot of ingrown hairs from flaring up if you use it right after you shave or use clippers.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 9-year old daughter who was getting a few blemishes.  I didn&#x27;t want to us harsh chemicals on her skin.  This was the perfect solution.  She washes her face with mild soap and then rolls on the tee tree oil.  All of the blemishes are gone and her skin looks great!  The first couple of times she used it, she said it tingled, but no other issues and it has not dried out her skin.  I highly recommend!</li>
