      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Others said it smelled good, like candy, but i feel like it had too much vanilla versus blackberry and lemon meriunge!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very sweet scent without being too overpowering.</li>
      <li>I also love the feel of B&amp;BW lotion, it leaves my skin silky smooth without being too greasy.</li>
      <li>Smells so sweet!</li>
      <li>I was really excited when I was able to find this product Online because Bath and Body Works discontinued this flavor in the store.</li>
      <li>my Friend said it smells like Melons Sweet on paris is the bomb love</li>
      <li>Thanks, Amazon!!!</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite scents because it just the right amount of sweet without overdoing it.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>Definately a dessert fragance a must buy for fans of light but sweet fragrance</li>
      <li>love this lotion so soft and lovely smell</li>
      <li>The name says it all its quite sweet.</li>
      <li>it smell as sweet as the one I received as a gift, and I can&#x27;t stop using and smelling it.</li>
      <li>AND IT IS RIGHT ON THE BUTTON, SWEET AND LIGHT.</li>
      <li>I first heard of this fragrance from a nurse at a doctor&#x27;s office [the light, sweet scent permeated the reception area].  </li>
      <li>very fast delivery!</li>
      <li>Paris Amour is still a little too \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; for my personal taste, but my daughter loved it and it&#x27;s a brighter, more refreshing scent than Sweet on Paris.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and very feminine.</li>
      <li>Decided to order it, and it was a reasonable price with free shipping.</li>
      <li>I even purchased an additional bottle to send to my daughter at work, just to make her smile.</li>
      <li>well worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely its own scent though.</li>
      <li>Sweet on Paris was too sweet for me, and even too sweet for my tween daughter -- which honestly surprised me.</li>
      <li>or i hadn&#x27;t gotten used to the scent, but it was over powering, after a few more days sniffing it was ok.</li>
      <li>Thanks sooo much! !</li>
      <li>good long lasting fragrance too, the lotion!</li>
      <li>Was pleased with the product, arrived on time and was what I expected.</li>
      <li>BETTER THAN I EXPECTED ......</li>
      <li>I really like this fragrance, comparable to cotton candy really.</li>
      <li>I REALLY wish this wasn&#x27;t discontinued.</li>
      <li>Also, the packaging was good, nothing chipped, or broken, brand new!!!</li>
      <li>However, shipping wasnt very quick, but it came within the expected delivery time.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended</li>
      <li>Normally I go in to Bath and Bodyworks needing assistance.</li>
      <li>I live it.</li>
      <li>I consider this a young womans scent teens to early 30s because of the overly candy like smell older ladies may not like.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical at first, but once the package arrived, my GF confirmed that this is the real thing at a substantial discount.</li>
      <li>It was recently 75% off at our local Bath and Body Works and we still both passed on it, despite the allure of getting a decent lotion for just a couple of bucks.</li>

<li> So sad it was only available for a limited time.</li>
<li> I think it smells sweet, like cotton candy or maybe angel food cake; it isn&#x27;t TOO sweet though..not enough to make you sick at least.</li>
<li> Long lasting scent, at least on my skin anyway increases the scent after using the Body wash.</li>
<li> I knew exactly what I was getting and wanted the product although it was too expensive.</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s like I have spent the morning baking!</li>
<li> I drove down to the states from montreal  to pick up my purchase and</li>
<li> My mom got me this lotion a few years ago</li>
<li> at first, i dont know if i was sick</li>
<li> Now I can&#x27;t find it at bath and body no more.</li>
<li> USUALLY I HAVE TO BE AT THE STORE TO SMELL THE PRODUCTS, NOW I GO BY RATINGS</li>
<li> I hope Bath and Body Works brings it back! :(</li>
<li> This came packaged very nicely, no spills.</li>
<li> And I&#x27;m really sad</li>
<li> the scent can&#x27;t go wrong buy it</li>
<li> Sad that i have to buy it here</li>
<li> I randomly picked this out and didn&#x27;t get a chance to smell it until I got home.</li>
<li> Sadly, I will have to order from them again because I cant find anyone else who sells it for this price.  </li>
<li> Too bad Bath &amp; Body Works doesn&#x27;t sell this lotion anymore.</li>

    <li> The description is on point but I was expecting somewhat of a cotton candy smell. It does smell good it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> I like the sweetness of this scent, it&#x27;s like I have spent the morning baking! I also love the feel of B&amp;BW lotion, it leaves my skin silky smooth without being too greasy.</li>
    <li> nice and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents because it just the right amount of sweet without overdoing it. I like that it lingers without being too overpowering.</li>
    <li> Great price for the real thing. I was skeptical at first, but once the package arrived, my GF confirmed that this is the real thing at a substantial discount. Get it while it lasts.</li>
    <li> at first, i dont know if i was sick or i hadn&#x27;t gotten used to the scent, but it was over powering, after a few more days sniffing it was ok. Others said it smelled good, like candy, but i feel like it had too much vanilla versus blackberry and lemon meriunge! IDK, but its ok, try the fragrance mist! it smells awesome!!! good long lasting fragrance too, the lotion! even when i tried scrubbing it off with soap, i could still smell it!!!! Also, the packaging was good, nothing chipped, or broken, brand new!!!</li>
    <li> One of my favorites!! It came quick and nothing broken.  Highly recommended</li>

    <li> I love this scent from Bath and Body Works. I got it here because it wasn&#x27;t being sold in the stores anymore. It&#x27;s a very sweet scent without being too overpowering.</li>
    <li> Always been my fav. Although they don&#x27;t sell it in stores I figured I would find it on here! Thank you</li>
    <li> I got one a a year or so ago and I still have it. It&#x27;s think so you dont have to use alot of it. The smell is long-lasting. When I went to the pool it stilled smell but then it went away. Now I can&#x27;t find it at bath and body no more. And I&#x27;m really sad</li>
    <li> love it!  very fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this and can not believe that Bath and Body Works dicontinued it.  i have bought Bath and Body Works for years and found this one that my Granddaughter had purchased and loved it.  i am so glad that i have been able to find it through Amazon.</li>

I think it smells sweet, like cotton candy or maybe angel food cake; it isn&#x27;t TOO sweet though..not enough to make you sick at least. It&#x27;s definitely its own scent though. I REALLY wish this wasn&#x27;t discontinued. I hope Bath and Body Works brings it back! :( Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This has to be my all time favorite love love and so does my boyfriend I&#x27;m so glad i can find it on Amazon:)</li>
    <li> I first heard of this fragrance from a nurse at a doctor&#x27;s office [the light, sweet scent permeated the reception area].  When I told her how great the fragrance was, she told me she loved it but that it was discontinued by Bath &amp; Body Works.  She suggested I check with Amazon.com ... I was able to get it, and have had many compliments.  It&#x27;s a very light, &#x27;sweet&#x27; fragrance ... which I think would be best during the warmer, summer months, but I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Too bad Bath &amp; Body Works doesn&#x27;t sell this lotion anymore. It is one of my favorites. It smells soooooo good.</li>
    <li> Super delicious scent!</li>
    <li> I was so bummed when I found out Bath &amp; Body no longer carried this scent. I live it. Everyone tells me I smell like cotton candy. Thanks, Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I never smelt it before. Normally I go in to Bath and Bodyworks needing assistance. Everything smells the same to me, but this smells soooo delectable. Lol it makes you want to taste whoever has it on.</li>
    <li> SAME AS ABOVE, ORDER IT, I PROMISE YOU WILL NOT REGRET ORDERING THIS FRAGRANCE.  USUALLY I HAVE TO BE AT THE STORE TO SMELL THE PRODUCTS, NOW I GO BY RATINGS AND IT IS RIGHT ON THE BUTTON, SWEET AND LIGHT.</li>
    <li> My mom got me this lotion a few years ago and I lost it, and found this online. Decided to order it, and it was a reasonable price with free shipping. The package arrived after only four days! Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I love this scent and its my favorite EVER!  This came packaged very nicely, no spills. However, shipping wasnt very quick, but it came within the expected delivery time.  I just ordered several Bath &amp; body works products on the same day  &amp; this one came 4-5 days later than all of the rest of them.  Sadly, I will have to order from them again because I cant find anyone else who sells it for this price.  I wish someone else would lower their prices on this scent so they could have all of my business!</li>
    <li> I love this body lotion ! It has a really nice and sweet smell ! I would recomend this product a lot</li>
    <li> Long lasting scent, at least on my skin anyway increases the scent after using the Body wash. Perfect moisture intensive and the smell heavenly!</li>
    <li> BETTER THAN I EXPECTED ...... IS ORIGINAL, SMELLS DELICIOUS.......VERY SWEET WICH IS GOOD FOR ME.......THE BEST BODY LOTION OF BBW IN MY OPINION. PACKAGE ARRIVED ON TIME AND IN GOOD CONDITION</li>
    <li> love this lotion so soft and lovely smell</li>
    <li> Wow..I am beyond impressed. I drove down to the states from montreal  to pick up my purchase and well worth it. Got all 4 bottles of my favorite discontinued cream and they were in perfect condition..got there quickly and great service.  Thanks sooo much! !</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion.  With out a doubt it is my all time favorite.  I even purchased an additional bottle to send to my daughter at work, just to make her smile.</li>
    <li> Love it. Gave it out to several friends and coworkers.  Bought extra for me for gifts and myself.  Was told it smells like cotton candy.</li>
    <li> Smells so sweet! It&#x27;s like cotton candy! I love this stuff. So sad it was only available for a limited time.</li>
    <li> it smell as sweet as the one I received as a gift, and I can&#x27;t stop using and smelling it. love, love.</li>
    <li> I really like this fragrance, comparable to cotton candy really. The name says it all its quite sweet. I consider this a young womans scent teens to early 30s because of the overly candy like smell older ladies may not like. Definately a dessert fragance a must buy for fans of light but sweet fragrance</li>
    <li> I was really excited when I was able to find this product Online because Bath and Body Works discontinued this flavor in the store.</li>
    <li> I knew exactly what I was getting and wanted the product although it was too expensive.</li>
    <li> Sweet on Paris was too sweet for me, and even too sweet for my tween daughter -- which honestly surprised me. It was recently 75% off at our local Bath and Body Works and we still both passed on it, despite the allure of getting a decent lotion for just a couple of bucks. We purchased Paris Amour instead even though it wasn&#x27;t on sale. Paris Amour is still a little too \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; for my personal taste, but my daughter loved it and it&#x27;s a brighter, more refreshing scent than Sweet on Paris.</li>
