      <li>I was like okay maybe they changed the packaging.</li>
      <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite shampoo of all time.</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>Safe to say I buy them there now.</li>
      <li>Why must companies discontinue every one of my favorite products.  </li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>Every shampoo line has a product that says it gives body and fullness to fine hair and most of them just don&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>Okay shampoo - Was hoping to help  with my thinning but did not see any significant change in thickness at all.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair feeling clean and healthy.</li>
      <li>I first got this a year or so ago and liked it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m already in love with it and this is my new favorite shampoo!</li>
      <li>At age 79, I have a thinning, fine head of gray hair.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair.</li>
      <li>But until we can afford Bossley or they come up with a budget friendly fool proof hair re-growth product, he is happy enough with the results from this shampoo.</li>
      <li>It leaves the scalp feeling clean and itch free.</li>
      <li>w great but thinning grey hair!</li>
      <li>well, leaves hair feeling full... not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t purchase this item from Amazon, but at a Publix Super Market in Orlando, FL.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how quickly it works.  </li>
      <li>bought this shampoo at the super market today and washed my hair with it as soon as I got home (even though I already had a shower this morning)</li>
      <li>it help the little spot on the top of my head I do wish it spelled better its OK</li>
      <li>i used the l&#x27;oreal site and found that it is available at many nearby dollar general stores.  </li>
      <li>I finally got lucky and found these as normal stock in Dollar General stores and the best price</li>
      <li>Fabulous for thinning hair and very lightweight but does condition.</li>
      <li>It was worth a shot.</li>
      <li>I found this shampoo the best to give my hair some volume and not fly around.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo which is no longer in the stores leaves my hair more puffy and with more body than any other i have used.</li>
      <li>The price seemed about right</li>
      <li>cause it just wAsnt laying right on my head.</li>
      <li>The top of my head has very fine hair and thought this might help a little bit.</li>
      <li>You can literally feel the difference right after the first use.</li>
      <li>I ordered some more of this and the difference was apparent after the first wash.</li>
      <li>Husband likes this product very much.</li>
      <li>They came before the time specified on the order, were exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it advertises.  </li>
      <li>Seems to be discontinued from local stores, so I was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t think my hair is thinning, but if it will slow, prevent, or help with that in any way, then that&#x27;s great.  </li>
      <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to do.  </li>
      <li>Just got this a few days ago and man it smells really good.</li>
      <li>I recommend it to anyone with very fine gair (and it doesn&#x27;t have to be grey).  </li>
      <li>i use this product because i have pretty flat hair and it seems to give my hair more body.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty positive</li>
      <li>My husband only wants Vive for sure</li>
      <li>After a shampoo and dry with this product my hair is noticeably thicker with more body.</li>
      <li>It is the only shampoo that I was able to use that left my hair clean, with out matting my hair.</li>
      <li>But some people just can&#x27;t live without it and so are willing to pay the higher price.</li>
      <li>But at the same time I notice a huge difference when I style.</li>
      <li>would highly reccomend this if you care about the way your hair looks and feels !</li>
      <li>and it really fluffs it up</li>
      <li>I used it for a whole month and did not see any results.</li>
      <li>It adds volume, but maybe just a smidge too much.  </li>
      <li>it really</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My preferred shampoo. Leaves hair feeling clean and healthy.</li>
    <li> My hair is not as manageable when I use this shampoo.  I did not use it long enough to evaluate the thickening aspect.  I have stopped using it for now.</li>
    <li> Have not used yet....looks o.k.</li>
    <li> Was in a different bottle than pictured!</li>
    <li> Does what it says.  I tend to like the style infusing shampoo a bit better myself.</li>
    <li> Not the same product!</li>
    <li> this is a great product for mens thinning hair,it also has a conditioner in it as well. would highly reccomend this if you care about the way your hair looks and feels !</li>
    <li> My husband has used this product for 7 yrs now.  Baldness runs in his family so of course his hair line is receding. (It&#x27;s not a miracle product) But in his family the men start loosing their hair at 20yrs old so you can imagine that something this cheap that actually works is a blessing to him.  It does help a lot with thinning possibly the loss too.  We ran out and he didn&#x27;t use it for 3 weeks (we couldn&#x27;t find it in the store anymore) His hair really started thinning badly even with Rogaine.  I&#x27;m so happy for one day shipping, cause I didn&#x27;t realize how quickly it works.  Now a week later you can really see a difference.  We had told his brother (who is only 1 year older than him) back when my hubby first started using the shampoo but he didn&#x27;t want to be bothered with it; and by 26yrs old had completely gone bald.  My  husband is now 27 and has only a receding hair line in the front by the temple but ALL of his hair.  Will it work for everybody?  Probably not.  But until we can afford Bossley or they come up with a budget friendly fool proof hair re-growth product, he is happy enough with the results from this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I really like the L&#x27;Oreal Viv Pro for Men 2-in-1 Daily Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner for Fine/Thinning Hair, 13 ounces.  However the price went from around $5 to over $11 and that is unreasonable, and I won&#x27;t buy it for that.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo, every day, on very thin hair. It does seem to make some difference. Now, it doesn&#x27;t turn baldness into a thick, full head of hair but it does make what you have seem like more. Considering the price, I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Two years ago, the water in Boston because much softer and now when you shampoo your hair the soft water makes your hair flat and lifeless. After a shampoo and dry with this product my hair is noticeably thicker with more body. Apply shampoo three times for best effect and you&#x27;ll see the volume.     The smell is kinda soapy and that&#x27;s the only bad thing about this product. Also, I do not think this has any conditioner in it because the ingredients are exactly the same as L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Daily Thickening Shampoo without conditioner.</li>
    <li> does not work at all, been using it for the past 2 years, i see my hair&#x27;s been getting thinner and thinner, you might as well use regular shampoo</li>
    <li> These are the best shampoo/conditioner for guys who want thicker hair. You can literally feel the difference right after the first use. Your hair looks and feels thicker - it really works!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not like the other so-called thickening shampoos like Head &amp; Shoulders, Vidal Sassoon, etc. that don&#x27;t show any noticeable improvements.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years, and it works great!  I am a woman, by the way.  I also have been using Men&#x27;s Extra Strength for 20 years and that products works great too!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband since we couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else.  I thought the price was a bit outrageous, but purchased anyway.  I can buy a better quality shampoo for this price.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> Great for thickening hair, plus a very good shampoo.  Will use again.  If you have thining or very fine hair give it a try.</li>
    <li> Newer version of this shampoo, will see if works.</li>
    <li> This shampoo which is no longer in the stores leaves my hair more puffy and with more body than any other i have used.</li>
    <li> Best men shampoo I&#x27;ve found so far. Seems to be discontinued from local stores, so I was glad to find it on Amazon. Will order more while supply lasts.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Very good product.  Not sure why local Walgreens and CVS quit handling.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it will do!</li>
    <li> Quality was above expectations.  I have tried other shampoos and they do not compare to Loreal for Men.  I have very thin hair and it really fluffs it up so it looks thicker than it is.  The only thing I found that I can&#x27;t buy this in my local drug stores where Loreal is sold.  They do not carry the Mens shampoo.  I tried Walmart, Rite Aid, Walgreens and CVS to no avail.</li>
    <li> My husband only wants Vive for sure &amp; I can&#x27;t always find it.  It works best for him, he says.</li>
    <li> Like others have stated the bottle I received is NOT as pictured. I got the white one with a sticker slapped on. I was like okay maybe they changed the packaging. I examined the bottle a little closer an the stickers were on crooked. Hmmmm.....okay. Popped it open to smell it, it smelled HORRIBLE! Don&#x27;t recall it smelling bad at all. Hmmmm....okay maybe they changed the packaging AND the formula. Poured some into my palm and it came out drippy/ runny. I have short to medium length hair &amp; it made it ratty. Like I shampooed and didn&#x27;t use conditioner. Approximately 5-10 after showering my scalp began to itch/ tingle. So long story short I&#x27;m pretty positive this isn&#x27;t the stuff I use the LOVE! Returned it immediately.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite shampoo of all time. Fabulous for thinning hair and very lightweight but does condition. He loves it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and how it does with my hair.  It also smells very good and manly as well.  It is super hard to find these except on here but they are way way overpriced by sellers etc.  I finally got lucky and found these as normal stock in Dollar General stores and the best price it is only $2.50 plus tax.  Safe to say I buy them there now.</li>
    <li> Okay shampoo - Was hoping to help  with my thinning but did not see any significant change in thickness at all. Does smell great though but not the results I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I use It to regrow my Hair, It Isn&#x27;t working Yet, But I&#x27;m Still Trying.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo, Too bad it was discontinued.  For those that don&#x60;t wanna pay obscene prices for what was once a modestly priced Product, Run, don&#x60;t walk to your local Dollar General Store and load up.  Just $2.50@ Bottle!</li>
    <li> They never should have discontinued this shampoo. It is the only shampoo that I was able to use that left my hair clean, with out matting my hair. Bring it back ! I have fine hair.</li>
    <li> Smells nice,  cleans great but didnt notice any change in my hair thickness or fullness.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me at all.  I used it for a whole month and did not see any results.</li>
    <li> For the price, I don&#x27;t like how it treats my hair.  It always feels heavy unmanageable after I use it.  This should be a $5 product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item a month ago after reading several reviews online. The top of my head has very fine hair and thought this might help a little bit. However after religiously using it everyday for a month, I have not seen any change in the thickness or fullness of my hair. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle, but it seems completely useless.</li>
    <li> Order received is not same as the picture shown. I got a white bottle with black sticker that says Vive pro. It seems like someone just printed out the sticker and stick it on the bottle.</li>
    <li> Its what I use to by but the bottle I received was white not the black bottle. It seems to work like old.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It may not make thin hair as bushy as they put off. But at the same time I notice a huge difference when I style. My hair does look a tad more &amp;#34;bushy&amp;#34;. The price of the 6 pack was great. I like being able to just have it on hand.</li>
    <li> excellent, thicken your hair.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris Vive Pro for Men 2-in-1 Daily Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner, Fine/Thinning Hair.  This is my shampoo - I am a typical guy when I find something that works we don&#x27;t like to give it up.  Case in point my shampoo.  My local stores stopped stocking it, quick search on the net found it at my Amazon. Just what don&#x27;t they have?  My 61 year old hair is thinning - and I can use all the help I can get.  This works for me, thats it.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful shampoo!!  I will order more for us.</li>
    <li> great shampoo that smells really good, i didnt buy another one but would recommend it, thing is idk if the thickening really worked on me it might have</li>
    <li> I would never use another shampoo.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 years so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to.  It it aint broken don&#x27;t fix it.  I interchangeably use the Thickening Shampoo [not a 2-in-1] and I find that product quite similar.  I sometimes use the Vive Pro Style-infusing conditioner that comes in a similarly packaged black and green bottle.</li>
    <li> Where do I start I was a bit skeptical to buy this shampoo but when I did it was the best investment for my hair. I had thin hair and after using the shampoo it helped thicken and nourish my hair. I hope L&#x27;Oreal start making this again. I recommend this to someone who has thin hair and anyone who wants to have full volume, healthy hair for a long time. Not many cons about this product. Hope this review helps :)</li>
    <li> It sucks that this product has been cancelled.  But some people just can&#x27;t live without it and so are willing to pay the higher price.</li>
    <li> If you have a spouse or son or any male member of your family who is losing hair, this is the product to get.</li>
    <li> At age 79, I have a thinning, fine head of gray hair.  I found this shampoo the best to give my hair some volume and not fly around.  I recommend it to anyone with very fine gair (and it doesn&#x27;t have to be grey).  I have used this for over a year.</li>
    <li> After my shower it felt like a layer of gel in my hair....and all day I was self conscious about my hair cause it just wAsnt laying right on my head. I wouldn&#x27;t bother with this shampoo</li>
    <li> Best shampoo smell great.</li>
    <li> I like this hair thickening shampoo it help the little spot on the top of my head I do wish it spelled better its OK some may love or hate it but I like the thickening enough to keep using it</li>
    <li> Use it since I don&#x27;t like to use a cream rinse.&lt;br /&gt;Lathers well, leaves hair feeling full... not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine anyone \\&quot;loving\\&quot; a shampoo.</li>
    <li> i use this product because i have pretty flat hair and it seems to give my hair more body.  i don&#x27;t think my hair is thinning, but if it will slow, prevent, or help with that in any way, then that&#x27;s great.  i, like many other users recently found that it was impossible to find in local stores.  i used the l&#x27;oreal site and found that it is available at many nearby dollar general stores.  amazon is a great site and i hate to take business away from them (not like they&#x27;ll even feel a pinch) but i thought i would help out others that are having difficulty finding a product they rely on.  i don&#x27;t think the product is discontinued at this point, but the lack of availability at major retailers suggests that the shampoo isn&#x27;t selling well at all.  good luck, and by all means, buy it from amazon if you can&#x27;t find it through the l&#x27;oreal retail finder.</li>
    <li> I am getting older and thinning a bit. I first got this a year or so ago and liked it. When I ran out I did not think much about it. Well, I wanted to get that thicker look again so I bought some other brands. Blah....not the same. I ordered some more of this and the difference was apparent after the first wash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure this stuff works,  but the store no longer carries it,  and it has to be better than Rogaine.</li>
    <li> Using it for years - keeps, makes hair, shine, have thickness. Use every one or two days. Do not need to use hugh amounts to have it be effective. No I do not work for the company that makes it (:--) !</li>
    <li> Great product.  My husband has used this product for a long time and prefers to any other shampoo.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Just got this a few days ago and man it smells really good. I&#x27;m already in love with it and this is my new favorite shampoo!</li>
    <li> As a shampoo it works great. As for the thicker hair, I really don&#x27;t think it does anything.  Oh well. It was worth a shot.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for many years. I have thinning hair, and it does help my hair look fuller. It leaves the scalp feeling clean and itch free. I would recommend this prodUct.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this item from Amazon, but at a Publix Super Market in Orlando, FL. It was priced at $4.99 and it was the only \\&quot;Volumizing\\&quot; type of shampoo/conditioner product I could find specifically for men. I&#x27;m on here writing a review because this was where I researched the product before I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to see that somebody paid $11 for this product. Whoever is charging people that much is ripping them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this shampoo at the super market today and washed my hair with it as soon as I got home (even though I already had a shower this morning) It smells kind of like the products Hair Cuttery, SuperCuts (insert budget hair cutting place here) uses but charge a lot more for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 22 going on 23 and my hair has gotten noticeably thin (men in my family start losing their hair in their early 20s), so I thought I would try this product. At $5 a bottle, the price is reasonable, the smell isn&#x27;t too bad, after a few weeks I will come back and let you all know how it is working</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever for older guy w great but thinning grey hair! We have been ordering on line for over. 2 yrs</li>
    <li> Best Hair stuff on the market - really works.  Excellent price fast delivery</li>
    <li> This shampoo is so hard to find and it works better than any other for my fine/thinning hair.  Every shampoo line has a product that says it gives body and fullness to fine hair and most of them just don&#x27;t work.  This L&#x27;Oreal Paris Vive Pro Thickening shampoo and condditioner is made especially for men and it has always worked for me.  Whether having my hair very short after a haircut or much longer it always adds body and fullness.  It doesn&#x27;t work as a thickening regime meaning it gives my hair volume that develops over time as many seem to think it does.  What it does do is after each use provide a fullness and volume to my hair that gives it new life.  I can&#x27;t find it in any store around here and am very thankful to find it from a third party seller here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> works good thickens hair</li>
    <li> Noticed myself starting to go a bit thin, so I shopped around Amazon and finally decided on a bottle of this shampoo.  It works well as a thickener, but my hair ends up feeling a little dry and running a little wilder than usual when I use it.  It adds volume, but maybe just a smidge too much.  I find alternating between this, Nizoral, and a regular run of the mill shampoo tends to work well for me, though of course everyone&#x27;s hair is different, so YMMV.</li>
    <li> I am 60 and my hair is thinning. I looked for this product locally and could not&lt;br /&gt;find here in L A . So I had to buy online. Does what it says and you can use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;I buy three bottles at a time.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes a noticeable difference for my husband&#x27;s hair. It appears that they have stopped making it. After finding it on Amazon (private seller)  $16, my husband found it at a dollar store !! Same brand just without the conditioner!!</li>
    <li> My husband can feel the difference in the thickness of his hair when he uses this shampoo compared to when he stops. That&#x27;s the only problem, you have to continue using the shampoo to keep any results.</li>
    <li> The smell is surely manly. I don&#x27;t think i noticed a difference? Kinda pricy for shampoo though.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I developed serious scalp folliculitis after using this product. After I switched to another kind of shampoo, the scalp folliculitis is gone in a few days. It is probably not affecting everyone, but it might affect some people like me. Sorry, not recommending this product.</li>
    <li> Husband likes this product very much. It is no longer on tore shelves--figure.</li>
    <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Vive Thickening Shampoo for years. It does what it says. It make my thinning hair feel thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was about out I went to several different drug stores and grocery stores to restock. Could not find it anyplace. So I turned to trusty Amazon and found it. The price seemed about right and I ordered two bottles. They came before the time specified on the order, were exactly what I wanted and I am please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If L&#x27;Oreal has discontinued this line, then I can only see the price of remaining stock going up, up, and up.</li>
    <li> I use this product on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing about it I do not like.&lt;br /&gt;I used to purchase it on a regular basis until all available retail stores no longer stocked it, thus prompting me to go to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will very likely purchase this product through Amazon in the future.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this product in the stores anymore.  It works well and seems to help with thinning hair.  Good price.</li>
    <li> Why must companies discontinue every one of my favorite products.  This works well, smells good... and is discontinued.  It will be missed.  L&#x27;Oreal, please bring this back.</li>
    <li> Great product for thinning hair!</li>
    <li> Made my hair really dry. My hair felt striped</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it advertises.  Works wonders!</li>
    <li> Smells great and certainly adds volume to my hair.</li>
