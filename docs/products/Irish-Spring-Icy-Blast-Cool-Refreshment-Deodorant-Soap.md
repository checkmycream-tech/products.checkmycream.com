      <li>only mention this for people who would be bothered that the scent &amp;#34;escaped&amp;#34; into the outer packaging instead of being contained inside the original plastic wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I picked some up at the grocery store, thinking it was the Original, and only realized my mistake when I got it home.</li>
      <li>Better than other soaps because of the aroma it exudes and the fragrance it leaves the bathroom.</li>

      <li>/&gt;They arrived in a single box, but one of the 8-packs had been &amp;#34;disassembled&amp;#34; so it would fit in the shipping box with</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s soap.  You wash yourself and it makes you clean.</li>
    <li> The packaging of the Moisture Blast Irish Spring looks a lot like the packaging of Irish Spring Original. And it was only because of this that I even became aware of Moisture Blast.

    <li> But at a higher price.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this since his teenage years and, well, I can attest it works as a soap. He has very sensitive skin and this is one of the few soaps that he doesn&#x27;t break out with. We&#x27;ll keep buying!</li>

    <li> It &#x27;s difficult for using.</li>
    <li> I bought three 8-packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrived in a single box, but one of the 8-packs had been &amp;#34;disassembled&amp;#34; so it would fit in the shipping box with the other two 8-packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only mention this for people who would be bothered that the scent &amp;#34;escaped&amp;#34; into the outer packaging instead of being contained inside the original plastic wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in 6 days.</li>

    <li> Love this soap! Tried switching to others, but keep going back. Moisture blast is great for winter, I would go for original during the summer.</li>
    <li> Wow what a great aroma. A friend had a bar of this soap but he did not remember which one he bought. So I found the right one and will buy this one again. It is also as it claims-moisture based.</li>
    <li> Quality product received as advertised.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like horse manure, which is my number one criteria when selecting soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much one can write on the virtues of soap itself, other than to note that, if one wants to be a member of a civilized society, soap is a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works, it smells good, the bars are &amp;#34;durable&amp;#34; (they don&#x27;t dissolve into mush the way some others do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is good, delivery is prompt.</li>

    <li> Nice pack of soap.  I like the scent it leaves on their skin.  I can clearly tell if the little guys washed as good as they need too!</li>
    <li> I like the smell and feel of this soap. If you&#x27;re buying this on Amazon, I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the best idea though. I got it for 50% less by going to a store. Thought that might be helpful to some, as I would have preferred to purchase through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I would not use any other soap...</li>
    <li> Better than other soaps because of the aroma it exudes and the fragrance it leaves the bathroom. It is a moisturizer in soap form .</li>

    <li> Love it ! Great price</li>
    <li> They smell fantastic and I love of the clean sensation I get from using them.</li>
