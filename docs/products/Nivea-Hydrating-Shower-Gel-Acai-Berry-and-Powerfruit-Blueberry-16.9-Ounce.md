      <li>An hour after my shower my husband hugged me and even commented on how good I smell!  </li>
      <li>Nivea always does great with hydrating (anti-dry-skin) soap.</li>
      <li>Plus they all smell great too.</li>
      <li>I love it!!  </li>
      <li>This body wash smells amazing!</li>
      <li>It smells great and foams up nicely.</li>
      <li>it has a good smell, but i didnt feel like repeating it&lt;br /&gt;there</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say there is anything exceptional about this shower gel.</li>
      <li>really great clean!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t run out too fast, and it smells great too!  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s very light and week and fades away soon.&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
      <li>and I love them all.</li>
      <li>and it does hydrate  what more can you ask for</li>
      <li>I love love how this product smells and would buy again and</li>
      <li>are so many in the market, and this one was not like i wanted it again.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
      <li>If it had more fragrance, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
      <li>Could sudds up more</li>
      <li>and I would like it better.</li>
      <li>BUT...I would like it so much more if the scent was stronger.</li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>It is fine though, as are most of the Nivea products.</li>
      <li>Makes your skin silky smooth.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and feel of this hydration gel, the price is also right.</li>
      <li>the added bonus is the amazing soft feel of my skin!</li>
      <li>the price is very low so that makes it a good buy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but not something I can rave about.</li>
      <li>This is a nice body wash and it does not dry your skin out.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t overpowering, but smells good without that &amp;#34;creme&amp;#34; soap feeling, so it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or leaving a film on me.</li>
      <li>I just love the way it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
      <li>SO CONVIENT TO HAVE THIS ITEM DELIVERED RIGHT TO YOUR DOOR</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, if you can find this gel at a good price, it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not drying and, to me, that&#x27;s all that really matters</li>
      <li>I really like this one</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s reasonable price</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really say this one is any more hydrating than Nivea&#x27;s other shower gels either.</li>
      <li>A little does not go a long way, but it smells great.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s a decent soap.</li>
      <li>It happened to be selling at a decent price, but I prefer Nivea&#x27;s citrus (orange) scent to this one.</li>
      <li>I like this body wash because it gives a really nice, subtle scent.</li>
      <li>But this gel is so mild, so I don&#x27;t need to buy the other feminine cleanser.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get any soap residue, however I don&#x27;t think that it leaves my skin as soft as, say, Caress body washes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other Nivea shower gel with success</li>
      <li>I find the quantity somehow too large for a single person use.</li>
      <li>One small squirt was enough to clean my entire body.</li>

<li> Writing review is very annoying, but when I use this &amp;#34;Nivea Hydrating Shower Gel, Acai Berry and Blueberry&amp;#34; yesterday, really love its fragrance, and decided to leave my review.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It is thick</li>
<li> I gave it 4 stars because it has a very subtle scent.  </li>
<li> I put a little on a body scrubby and it foamed like crazy!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve also told a couple of my friends about it and gave them bottles to try and needless to say they are hooked also.</li>
<li> For this price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
<li> shower gel makes my eyes and skin irritated with awkward chemical scents.</li>
<li> originally hate all of the &amp;#34;fruit, vanilla, baby, or chemical&amp;#34; scents of cosmetics and bath products including the scents of Nivea and Johnson &amp; Johns cream and etc.</li>

    <li> This is an excellent product. It rinses off well, unlike some other products I&#x27;ve used.  I gave it 4 stars because it has a very subtle scent.  I wish it was a bit stronger or not at all.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. ..n the added bonus is the amazing soft feel of my skin! And a lil goes a long gggg way!  Love it!</li>

    <li> Writing review is very annoying, but when I use this &amp;#34;Nivea Hydrating Shower Gel, Acai Berry and Blueberry&amp;#34; yesterday, really love its fragrance, and decided to leave my review.&lt;br /&gt;I originally hate all of the &amp;#34;fruit, vanilla, baby, or chemical&amp;#34; scents of cosmetics and bath products including the scents of Nivea and Johnson &amp; Johns cream and etc. So I hesitated to buy this gel cuz it also has berry extracts.&lt;br /&gt;But, it&#x27;s reasonable price and I decided to buy it cuz I wonder Acai smell. It&#x27;s amazing!! Although I hate the fruit scents of cosmetics and bath products, it&#x27;s really fragrant!! Different! I love it!!  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s very light and week and fades away soon.&lt;br /&gt;Many shower gel makes my eyes and skin irritated with awkward chemical scents. But this gel is so mild, so I don&#x27;t need to buy the other feminine cleanser.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say there is anything exceptional about this shower gel. It happened to be selling at a decent price, but I prefer Nivea&#x27;s citrus (orange) scent to this one.

    <li> This particular scent is harsh on my skin.  I&#x27;ve used other Nivea shower gel with success but this one is not of the same quality.  Will NOT buy this again.</li>
    <li> it has a good smell, but i didnt feel like repeating it&lt;br /&gt;there are so many in the market, and this one was not like i wanted it again.&lt;br /&gt;its a good scented though, but lil bit boring after a week.</li>
    <li> SO CONVIENT TO HAVE THIS ITEM DELIVERED RIGHT TO YOUR DOOR</li>
    <li> I put a little on a body scrubby and it foamed like crazy! One small squirt was enough to clean my entire body. BUT...I would like it so much more if the scent was stronger. I have a sensitive nose and could barely tell it&#x27;s blueberry and acai - it smells like plain soap. If it had more fragrance, I would have given it 5 stars. For sudsing, it gets 5 stars. Using a  scrubby definitely activates the foam. My skin didn&#x27;t feel moisturized (or dry) after using it so it&#x27;s a decent soap.</li>
    <li> I find the quantity somehow too large for a single person use. It is fine though, as are most of the Nivea products.</li>
    <li> A little does not go a long way, but it smells great. Could sudds up more and I would like it better.</li>
    <li> This body wash smells amazing! I can smell on my skin several hours after using it. Makes your skin silky smooth. Would definitley purchase again!</li>
    <li> This is a nice body wash and it does not dry your skin out. For this price you can&#x27;t go wrong. This is a Save and Subscribe item for me.</li>
    <li> really great clean! and it does hydrate  what more can you ask for</li>
    <li> A friend of mine gave me a bottle of nivea body wash about a year and a half ago and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since. I use all different types of their body washes and lotion and I love them all. I just love the way it makes my skin feel so soft. Plus they all smell great too. I&#x27;ve also told a couple of my friends about it and gave them bottles to try and needless to say they are hooked also.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and feel of this hydration gel, the price is also right.</li>
    <li> This shower gel is perfect for my uses. It smells great and foams up nicely.</li>
    <li> I love love how this product smells and would buy again and the price is very low so that makes it a good buy</li>
