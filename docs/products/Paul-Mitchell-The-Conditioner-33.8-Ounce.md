      <li>What I receive from E-V Shop via Amazon moved to freely in the bottle.</li>
      <li>When I finally decided to use it - it applied great and detangled and moisturized my hair accordingly.</li>

      <li>It is not as easy to use because it is a larger container, but the product is excellent, I doubt if I would ever use a different conditioner and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
      <li>Really helps maintain moisture and that healthy feeling you want,</li>
      <li>great product - makes hair thick and smooth</li>
      <li>as I said, I rarely wash my hair).</li>

      <li>Keeps my hair soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>I will say that I recognized the blue gel like look in this bottle more than I do from the one I bought from Amazon</li>
      <li>and now I&#x27;m a real fan!</li>
      <li>As stated on PM&#x27;s bottles both in salons and stores: The authenticity of the product will not be guaranteed unless bought in their salons or by their first party vendors so to speak.</li>
      <li>I will say that I recognized the blue gel like look in this bottle more than I do from the one I bought from Amazon</li>

      <li>Although this bottle works, there&#x27;s no way to confirm that the next one will work also so that&#x27;s something to think about. &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>This is the best product I have ever found for my long, curly, frizzy hair., and it is not sticky or greasy or stiff.</li>
      <li>it works just as good as some of my more expensive curl cremes.</li>
      <li>My second daughter has fly away hair, may look cute to momma but not to a little lady that is just become a teen.  </li>
      <li>This the firs itme I have purchased the large 33.8 once bottle.</li>
      <li>It works very well.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
      <li>conditioner is so gentle, you can use it while shaving or use it as a conditioner after you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s much thinner.</li>
      <li>The original is just a bit thicker which means that your curls will last longer.</li>
      <li>product, from this specific seller, is definitely 100% authentic.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I looked this product up on EWG.org&#x27;s skin deep guide and was happy to see that it scored a low rating (less chemicals).</li>
      <li>Needed a gel/ conditioner to style hair with out gel turning into concrete when it dries.</li>
      <li>- 2 months later: The bottle is still going strong but I&#x27;ll definitely need another soon.</li>
      <li>Amazon is a third party vendor and the likely-hood of you receiving a compromised or expired product is higher.</li>
      <li>normally buy on Amazon, but this time I purchased three 33.8 ounce bottles directly from Amazon seller Pharmapacks website for $51.95 shipped.</li>
      <li>Easy to use little dab will do you.</li>
      <li>This works great if you normally use small amounts of gel to style your hair; it won&#x27;t make your hair stiff or crunchy.</li>

      <li>This product keeps my AA curly/kinky hair soft and well moisturized.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this hair care product. Amazing for curly hair right out of the shower. Better than mousse or gel. Makes my hair so soft after a day of using it.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. I shampoo about 2 or 3 times a week and use this afterwards. It is a leave-in conditioner, but it&#x27;s not a spray. I mix this with a little bit of water in my hand to make it easier to evenly distribute. I have fine, thin, normal hair. I avoid styling products since they weigh my hair down and they have to be washed out (as I said, I rarely wash my hair). This conditioner helps my hair hold the style. I find that curls stay a little bit longer when I use this as opposed to just shampoo and no conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love this product and I love this seller.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have used this conditioner for years. Easy to use little dab will do you.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Not greasy.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years. Only need a very small amount to get my hair to lie down when combed or brushed.</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner for years, but the latest delivery had this water downed crap with no taper seal. Amazon has to do better quality control!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Paul Mitchell Moisture Conditioner for years, but my hair was still frizzy and not as soft as it used to be. I tried The Conditioner hoping it would help, and I was not disappointed. This is, by far, the best conditioner I have ever used.</li>
    <li> It is hard for me to rate this product because the authenticity of the bottle I received is questionable. With that said, the product works for my natural hair, so far, but you never know. To get into my review: I received the product a day earlier than expected and that&#x27;s a plus. On to the product - I&#x27;m not sure if it is the conditions (a heated environment) the product was in or if the product is beginning to expire, but the consistency of the PMTC  bottle I received looked as if it was diluted with water. PMTC is a thick leave-in and  when I compared it to a bottle I already had on hand, I became alarmed. What I received was watered down. What I receive from E-V Shop via Amazon moved to freely in the bottle. It swished like a diluted product.  As I further investigated the product, I poured quite a bit of it in a bowl and the color of it was very close to the bottle I already had. I also smelled it and it had more of a floral scent than the bottle I already had. When I finally decided to use it - it applied great and detangled and moisturized my hair accordingly. The downside is that my heavy hand will cause me to go through it faster because the product is thinned.  I can&#x27;t say for sure if the product is compromised, but luckily, I can still use it and my hair is still on my head. BUYERS BEWARE: As stated on PM&#x27;s bottles both in salons and stores: The authenticity of the product will not be guaranteed unless bought in their salons or by their first party vendors so to speak. Amazon is a third party vendor and the likely-hood of you receiving a compromised or expired product is higher. So beware of the risks and be sure to read return policies. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - 2 months later: The bottle is still going strong but I&#x27;ll definitely need another soon. I haven&#x27;t lost any hair and the instant moisture this product gives me serves its purpose. I would love to order another bottle from Amazon or an Amazon vender but I&#x27;m afraid of the quality of product I will receive in the bottle. Although this bottle works, there&#x27;s no way to confirm that the next one will work also so that&#x27;s something to think about. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - 7 months later: Luckily, I&#x27;ve still got some product left, but I recently bought another bottle off Ebay this time and you guys &#x3D;( It too is broken down and not as thick as this particular leave-in usually is. I will say that I recognized the blue gel like look in this bottle more than I do from the one I bought from Amazon but I&#x27;m still feeling some type of way. I want thick gel like leave-in. I think I&#x27;m going to buy a bottle from an Ulta near me and compare. Until then ... Be great!ve in the bottle.

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years!!!  This is not the same product I&#x27;ve bought at salons. It&#x27;s odor is different &amp; it&#x27;s much thinner. Also, when I&#x27;ve used it in the past, it actually makes my hair really curly when air dried. This does not- limp &amp; dry looking. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> This is a great leave in conditioner, have used it for many years now. I would recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> great product - makes hair thick and smooth</li>
    <li> Think this is a i station the writing came off the bottle</li>
    <li> My husband has used this conditioner for his short thick hair for many years.  He doesn&#x27;t use it as a true &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34;, believe he rinses most of it out.  He refuses to use anything else so I always buy the 33.8 ounce size which saves a lot of money if you price it out per ounce.  I have tried using this for myself and my kids - all fine hair - and haven&#x27;t been pleased with the results.  It weighs our hair down too much.  Still, I had to give it 5 stars overall since it has been a great product for many years for my husband.</li>
    <li> I have a long perm and Paul Mitchell leave-in conditioner is the only thing that works quickly after shower to comb through. I also use the detangler in the shower and freeze and shine for styling.</li>
    <li> I was on the brink of straightening my hair when I found this product. I&#x27;ve changed my mind since. This gives a kind of wet-look that stays on your hair for about 8 hours. I love it.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for conditioner to rinse through your hair after a shampoo, this is not it.  This is a leave in conditioner.  Works great, just make sure you know what you are getting.</li>
    <li> Great as always.  My second daughter has fly away hair, may look cute to momma but not to a little lady that is just become a teen.  Tames her hair with out being greasy!  Perfect.</li>
    <li> Needed a gel/ conditioner to style hair with out gel turning into concrete when it dries. Enriches hair in excellent condition . Large container last 6 months.</li>
    <li> This is the only non-shampoo hair product I use.  A very small amount (about the size of a pea) massaged into my hair before brushing does the job.  Originally recommended by the hair salon I patronized for many years.  This size item will last a long, long time.</li>
    <li> It leaves my thick, course, dry hair feeling silkier and adds moisture.  I don&#x27;t have to use much. A little quarter-sized dab works well. I definitely recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner ever!!! My hair was thinning and breaking off (very weak). I couldn&#x27;t get it to grow until I started using this product. Now I have a head full of healthy hair and I love it. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this conditioner for 15+ years. This is a watered down version. I have been meaning to write this review for a while but have been too busy. It smells the same, but it is definitely clearer and not as thick.</li>
    <li> Always go back to Paul Mitchell leave in conditioner. This time we were NOT happy about the condition the product arrived in - that is to say, it had leaked all over the bag into a mess.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily and or greasy, which is great and it really helps to keep my hair from becoming too frizzy.</li>
    <li> I actually use this as my leave in but it doubles as my curl creme. I have loose curls/waves and when I use this I dont have to add a curl creme to hold curl it works just as good as some of my more expensive curl cremes. I also get compliments on the smell of my hair which is always a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner, been using it for years on my natural 4C hair. Really helps maintain moisture and that healthy feeling you want,</li>
    <li> good stuff just after a while it dries out</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t like the gunk that comes with gel and the resultant skin conditions that come from it, this is your saving grace. I use this leave-in conditioner in place of gel and everything holds in the right places without feeling stiff. It looks great, smells fresh, and there&#x27;s plenty of it! Definitely a repeat customer</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I ever used and I&#x27;ll use it the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> It works very well. Don&#x27;t know what people are complaining about.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years ......It just takes a little and the bottle will last forever. It&#x27;s a leave in conditioner, get out of the shower ,put about quarter size in palm of hand work through hair. I have long hair so use less for short hair. Would highly recommend. Thank you, Billie</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying the large bottle of The Conditioner for years from Amazon and the bottle of conditioner that I received on June 3, 2015 smells bad (not like Paul Mitchell) and is diluted.  Do not buy!</li>
    <li> Great conditioner and I am very happy that I purchased it through Amazon!  If you want your hair to look good and smell great, I recommend you try this product!</li>
    <li> I never use anything else.</li>
    <li> Product as described. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Does not keep my hair from frizzing,  Giving to girl friend who recommended it  --  she loves this product.</li>
    <li> Wished the Gallon wasn&#x27;t the same price as buying four separate 33.8oZ.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and always come back to it after trying other products.  I recommend this conditioner and hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.</li>
    <li> Also received a watered down bottle. I have used this product for 10 years now; I know the difference. Stay away.</li>
    <li> This the firs itme I have purchased the large 33.8 once bottle. It is not as easy to use because it is a larger container, but the product is excellent, I doubt if I would ever use a different conditioner and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Wonderful conditioner for my dry hair, very high quality as with all Paul Mitchell products. This conditioner really makes dry hair feel soft.</li>
    <li> This product keeps my AA curly/kinky hair soft and well moisturized. HOLY GRAIL PRODUCT!  I never want to be without it!</li>
    <li> very good product, good hold and no flaking.</li>
    <li> I Love all the Paul Mitchell products I&#x27;ve ever tried.  However, when I purchased thus, I did not realize this was the leave-in conditioner.  I went by the name that was on my conditioner bottle I used recently at a  hotel.  My hair is very dry, thick &amp; course, so I did not return it since I figured I&#x27;ll use it at some point.</li>
    <li> Wonderful leave-in conditioner to protect ends. Recommended by my Mom&#x27;s hairdresser in MI and now I&#x27;m a real fan!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this leave in conditioner for years. It&#x27;s an excellent product that leaves your hair soft and manageable. After you shampoo your hair and while your hair is slightly damp, just put a small amount in your hands and wipe it through your hair. Comb or brush your hair and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is so gentle, you can use it while shaving or use it as a conditioner after you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally buy on Amazon, but this time I purchased three 33.8 ounce bottles directly from Amazon seller Pharmapacks website for $51.95 shipped. They had a $10 off coupon for orders over $40, plus free USPS priority shipping over $49. Excellent deal and lightning quick shipping as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, from this specific seller, is definitely 100% authentic. This was also confirmed by a very nice Amazon member as well. I wanted to mention this because, some members have mentioned authenticity issues in their reviews.</li>
    <li> I looked this product up on EWG.org&#x27;s skin deep guide and was happy to see that it scored a low rating (less chemicals). I was disappointed to find out, however, that it contains wheat germ so I can&#x27;t use it bc I am gluten sensitive. It was really expensive, and I had to give it away.</li>
    <li> The container says it&#x27;s Paul Mitchell The Conditioner, but the contents (the conditioner) is watery compared to any time I&#x27;ve bought the product before. This watery consistency is a total surprise.</li>
    <li> I buy this same bottle all the time and it has enough to hold me over for 6 months of continuous use. I tried the GVC (or whatever its called) version and even though it&#x27;s close, you can tell that it has more water in it. The original is just a bit thicker which means that your curls will last longer. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use this as a leave in conditioner after I get out of the shower every day.  It hardens at first, but once it&#x27;s fully dry it doesn&#x27;t look like there is any product in my hair.  Keeps my hair soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years! It leaves my hair silky and manageable. Everyone always says that they like my hair ... Thank God for this product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product that helps condition and repair damaged hair. Not heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> Arrived as advertised and on time.  Purchase for husband and son who both have coarse curly hair. It helps to soften and weigh down curls. This is a heavy product, not for people with thin limp hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever found for my long, curly, frizzy hair., and it is not sticky or greasy or stiff. It just works! Without this product my hair is straw.</li>
    <li> This works great if you normally use small amounts of gel to style your hair; it won&#x27;t make your hair stiff or crunchy.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is the BEST for curly hair! It controls frizz and brings out the curl - makes them defined and beautiful!</li>
    <li> Unlike other times I have purchased this product on Amazon, this appears to be the real deal. This comes out of the bottle thick and is the correct color blue. It&#x27;s great for my dry hair.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner ever</li>
    <li> Didnt receive the correct bottle</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for years and absolutely love it. It keeps my hair soft, healthy and moisturized. I highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Our young daughter has curly hair and regular kid shampoo doesnt condition enough and neither do detangler sprays.....(one brand even made her hair break off!!) We use this and a leave in at night. For day use, I made a detangler spray by mixing some of this conditioner with water in a spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;No more tangles!</li>
    <li> Great price for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> Best hair conditioner on the market. Everything by Paul Mitchell is excellent product. My husband and I use this daily.</li>
