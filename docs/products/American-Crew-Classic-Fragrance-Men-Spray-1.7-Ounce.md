      <li>My  wife and i love this scent.</li>
      <li>but i&#x27;d imagine you could do better at the dollar store.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure we will be buying more. :)</li>
      <li>My fiancé and I both love it.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for many years.  </li>
      <li>I love it and most important</li>
      <li>If you can smell your own cologne, strongly, after 30min, you put way too much on, and reek, trust me.</li>
      <li>I guess when you buy cheap cologne, you buy cheap quality.</li>
      <li>Not too much more you can really ask for.</li>
      <li>Scent is not too overpowering, just light and fresh.</li>
      <li>Not bad by any means, but it doesn&#x27;t stand out at all.</li>
      <li>Order arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Some people complain that it&#x27;s too mild.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice mild cologne, and the only one I can wear, because my wife and kids are allergic to everything else.</li>
      <li>As a fragrance in it own it was nothing special and a little strong for my taste.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the change of smell but what I really like is the pocket size (and cost).</li>
      <li>The fragrance helps you to feel fresh</li>
      <li>Stetson Fresh By Coty For Men Cologne Spray 1.5 Oz]] and</li>
      <li>This stuff smells great, isn&#x27;t too expensive, and the ladies love it.</li>
      <li>This was not what I ordered, it was the fragrance I ordered but not the right container, nor was it the right amount of ounces, very displeased.</li>
      <li>when you walk in to a room  people dont smell you first</li>
      <li>If you like a clean, fresh scent, American Crew is the one.</li>
      <li>I bought assuming it would smell similar to their classic hair product lines as I really love the smell of their pomade, shampoo, body wash, etc.</li>
      <li>I have used this particular American Crew for many years.</li>
      <li>One negative: scent fades more quickly than a true cologne.</li>
      <li>but i have had previously this same colonge and it smells really good</li>
      <li>Not as strong as some other body sprays.</li>
      <li>it smells wonderful, came on time, drives women crazy, is exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>No different than drug store aftershave smells nice wont go out of my way to buy again its a little pricey.</li>
      <li>A very classy, refined fragrance.  </li>
      <li>My 12 year old boy smelled the scent at a haircut and asked for it for Christmas.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t last the whole day.</li>
      <li>Arrived early.</li>
      <li>It only sticks on you for a few hours at most.  </li>
      <li>At least it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
      <li>so I have only had it for one day and so far it&#x27;s great!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was expecting the product to exude cheapness, but my girlfriend liked it and thought it smelled like expensive cologne.</li>

<li> Has a hint menthol like other American Crew product.</li>
<li> No less, no more.</li>

<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s my \\&quot;mid-tier\\&quot; cologne; not for everyday use, but for things like team meetings and such.  </li>
<li> but disappointing its not like the original scent like the shampoo.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a small slim metal short bottle</li>
<li> cologne seem like it was half way empty</li>
<li> I only have one complaint, its about the longevity of the cologne.  </li>
<li> and then cools down into aquanetesque</li>
<li> like a samplers and smell is little off!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not overbearing, too heavy or smell like all of the rest of the mainstream scents.</li>
<li> stuff is pretty bad.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s subtle but noticeable.</li>
<li> its strange too cause their pomades, washes and shampoos all smell insanely great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Customer service stinks too...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This smells nothing like their hair care products. I use Fiber and was hoping the fragrance would be the same.</li>
    <li> women love the smell its not over powering. when you walk in to a room  people dont smell you first</li>
    <li> I have been using this for many years.  The fragrance helps you to feel fresh and it lasts most of the day.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as advertised!!!</li>
    <li> For the price this is a great cologne.  It smells sort of earthy and spicy, nice scent for the colder months i think.  I only have one complaint, its about the longevity of the cologne.  It only sticks on you for a few hours at most.  If it lasted longer i would have given it five stars.</li>
    <li> Has a hint menthol like other American Crew product. Will last maybe a couple of hours. Not as strong as some other body sprays.</li>
    <li> We have looked everywhere for this and finally find it hope they keep it in stock and it isnt going away!</li>
    <li> My husband and two sons use this spray and it makes them and the house smell so good. We will always keep a supply on hand.</li>
    <li> Excellent Value, fast shipment.</li>
    <li> My  wife and i love this scent. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Order arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> it smells wonderful, came on time, drives women crazy, is exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> This fragrance smells surprisingly good. I was expecting the product to exude cheapness, but my girlfriend liked it and thought it smelled like expensive cologne. Scent is not too overpowering, just light and fresh.</li>
    <li> I have used this particular American Crew for many years. I stumbled across this source on Amazon on a lark. I enjoy the change of smell but what I really like is the pocket size (and cost). I keep one in my truck so that if I&#x27;ve been on a job and a bit musky a couple of squirts and I can walk into a meeting not smelling like a horse or a flower shop.</li>
    <li> This Men&#x27;s Fragrance smells absolutely Great.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great, isn&#x27;t too expensive, and the ladies love it. Not too much more you can really ask for.</li>
    <li> This is an example of \\&quot;You get what you paid for\\&quot;...&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered 5 of them. My family loves this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;All of these fragrance sprays came without a boxes,&lt;br /&gt;look like a samplers and smell is little off!&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;Items was sent to me by  \\&quot;5 star supply\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;PS: Customer service stinks too...</li>
    <li> This was not what I ordered, it was the fragrance I ordered but not the right container, nor was it the right amount of ounces, very displeased.</li>
    <li> i have not recieved this product yet but i have had previously this same colonge and it smells really good</li>
    <li> My fiancé and I both love it. It&#x27;s subtle but noticeable. I&#x27;m sure we will be buying more. :)</li>
    <li> The process from start to finish was a success.&lt;br /&gt;American Crew is a great fragrance, the price was the best I could find and the service was exactly what was promised, the shipment actually arrived earlier&lt;br /&gt;then expected.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this product as I can no longer find it in stores.  It was a great price, and shipped fast.</li>
    <li> This cologne did not meet my expectation the reason why is because the product I purchase wasnt what I received its not the bottle I was looking at and expecting also cologne seem like it was half way empty it&#x27;s no comparison to the product that&#x27;s being advertise the bottle is completely different it&#x27;s a small slim metal short bottle nothing like the glass bottle you guys advertise</li>
    <li> Arrived early. It&#x27;s a nice mild cologne, and the only one I can wear, because my wife and kids are allergic to everything else. Some people complain that it&#x27;s too mild. I&#x27;ve only gotten compliments, and I&#x27;ve been using it for 15 years. If you can smell your own cologne, strongly, after 30min, you put way too much on, and reek, trust me.</li>
    <li> this enchanting musk &amp;#34;opens&amp;#34; with a scent similar to OFF! and then cools down into aquanetesque aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this stuff is pretty bad. im no cologne expert but i&#x27;d imagine you could do better at the dollar store. its strange too cause their pomades, washes and shampoos all smell insanely great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not too bummed as it was only about 10.00 w/ shipping.</li>
    <li> I love it and most important is that my wife loves it. will buy it again good stuff laa laa</li>
    <li> My 12 year old boy smelled the scent at a haircut and asked for it for Christmas.  He loved it.</li>
    <li> This fragrance doesn&#x27;t go a long way. I guess when you buy cheap cologne, you buy cheap quality. I still use it when I travel though.</li>
    <li> very good masculine smell! but disappointing its not like the original scent like the shampoo. but i would still recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> Crew is the only cologne my husband wears. I will definately order again when he runs out. So glad to find it.</li>
    <li> Gives off a citrus/spicy smell that doesn&#x27;t last very long. Not bad by any means, but it doesn&#x27;t stand out at all. At least it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> I bought assuming it would smell similar to their classic hair product lines as I really love the smell of their pomade, shampoo, body wash, etc. If that&#x27;s what your expecting, this product isn&#x27;t for you as it has a totally different scent. As a fragrance in it own it was nothing special and a little strong for my taste.</li>
    <li> If you like a clean, fresh scent, American Crew is the one. It&#x27;s not overbearing, too heavy or smell like all of the rest of the mainstream scents. One negative: scent fades more quickly than a true cologne.</li>
    <li> I order this product Monday and it got here yesterday so I have only had it for one day and so far it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;As the title says &amp;#34;Classic Fragrance&amp;#34;....No less, no more. I personally like how it smells but if you like colognes like the Abercrombie Fierce you probably won&#x27;t like it much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall...Good product. I would recommend it to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review in a couple of days.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my \\&quot;mid-tier\\&quot; cologne; not for everyday use, but for things like team meetings and such.  A very classy, refined fragrance.  Boys and teens; do yourself a favor and ditch the body spray!!!  Fragrances like this, [[ASIN:B002XQ1Y5E Stetson Fresh By Coty For Men Cologne Spray 1.5 Oz]] and [[ASIN:B000EJZ214 Truth by Calvin Klein for men 3.4 oz Eau De Toilette EDT Spray]] are a must have.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. Great size for travel.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last the whole day. But it is a very pleasant fragrance to wear. would I buy it again? Yes. It has a (just got out of the shower smell). Great for keeping it in your gym bag.</li>
    <li> No different than drug store aftershave smells nice wont go out of my way to buy again its a little pricey.</li>
    <li> Like the metal container for travel.</li>
