      <li>Never buy cheap glue.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s a fantastic product.</li>
      <li>looks more natural, holds better.</li>
      <li>And let&#x27;s be real, if you want your hair to stay on your head when it comes time to remove the goo then you should probably pay a bit more for some quality, just sayin&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
      <li>Find a good one, and install your hair carefully, with the minimum amount to securely hold it.</li>
      <li>While I couldn&#x27;t use this glue with my hair color, it did arrive quickly -</li>
      <li>Find a good one, and install your hair carefully, with the minimum amount to securely hold it.</li>
      <li>It arrived new and able to use .. Just as advertised .</li>
      <li>two fresh bald spots, on either temple, were the result.</li>
      <li>two fresh bald spots, on either temple, were the result.</li>
      <li>/&gt;shipped super fast!</li>
      <li>RIGHT</li>
      <li>So be very careful and choose wisely.  </li>
      <li>Finally, no more pack hair from the beauty supply, I got the good stuff like the pros do, and I was excited to install it.</li>
      <li>then their like new!!!</li>
      <li>Many bottles of remover, clarifying shampoo, coconut oil, and oil sheen spray later I was mortified....</li>
      <li>This one is the first glue i have used, i read comments below reading that someone else used it as well.</li>
      <li>If you are buying it for something other than the &amp;#34;lace closure top&amp;#34; then it is probably ok!  </li>
      <li>I love this bonding glue , I actually don&#x27;t wear extensions ; I use this for my eyelashes!</li>
      <li>So I was pretty scared about doing it again</li>
      <li>Then the first time i washed my hair the extensions admittely came out</li>
      <li>Many bottles of remover, clarifying shampoo, coconut oil, and oil sheen spray later I was mortified....</li>
      <li>Weeks (literally weeks) later and many hair washings</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s awesome (even though it smells like booty) holds down my extensions, even when they get wet!</li>
      <li>And this was with MUCH CARE giving, not blindly tearing extensions out.</li>
      <li>And this was with MUCH CARE giving, not blindly tearing extensions out.</li>
      <li>were reasonable.</li>
      <li>AND IT IS SO MUCH EASIER TO USE THE GLUE.</li>
      <li>but this really doesn&#x27;t seem to work.  </li>
      <li>Great for putting false eyelashes on, or sticking gems to face or body.</li>
      <li>when u pull them off later u can then pull the glue right off the lashes!</li>
      <li>I wish they&#x27;d just change the description to add that it is black colored glue for the non hair pro&#x27;s like myself who don&#x27;t know any better.</li>
      <li>I am glad I only used a tiny bit since I was trying a temporary fix until I could get to my hair dresser.</li>
      <li>Not only does it not leave residue on hair but it will dry completely and it very easy to remove.</li>
      <li>Spend a little bit extra on quality glue, remember when you are mulling ovewr the extra two dollars for a better brand that this stuff is going to be first and foremost applied to your HEAD, right on your BARE SCALP...</li>
      <li>Since I spent so much on the extensions I went dirt cheap with the glue, the bottles for 99 cents at my local beauty supply.</li>
      <li>little tube has gone far above and beyond the package promises for me, and I&#x27;m sure many other beauty junkies know exactly what I mean.</li>
      <li>later i still have huge chunks of latex glue stuck in my hair and have even lost a few chunks of hair in the process.</li>
      <li>Extension glue can do so much, as long as it&#x27;s a decent quality one.</li>
      <li>First thing I noticed that unless I put a metric ton of goop on tghe hair it wouldn&#x27;t stay in one place, either peeling up at the ends or just sliding into a slghtly different spot, even with careful, methodical application of the weft to my head.</li>
      <li>Then when I had enough after 3 weeks the epic struggle to remove the glue took 3 entire days.</li>
      <li>Obviously, I purchased the wrong kind.  </li>
      <li>Notice less real eyelashes pulled out</li>

<li> this is the only brand I have ever used only thing is they sent me the 30 sec one instead of the reg.</li>
<li> The glue above this one said it dried clear</li>
<li> (she dips the handle of long eye make up brush into it and applys onto lashes.</li>
<li> And it did not bond tightly, only left the black residue.  </li>
<li> the area can be a bit fragile and a little extra quality goes a long way.</li>
<li> The second bottle was nearly empty!</li>
<li> I couldn&#x27;t leave the house, go to work, nothing, just struggled until my arms were numb trying to gingerly untangle the gobs of black chewing-gum-like substance from my precious scalp.</li>
<li> Smells awful at first but fine when dry.</li>
<li> Not what I expected.  </li>
<li> it came faster then expected.</li>
<li> as for the product it is what I expected I have used this before</li>
<li> Holds for a long time, but black color does tend to smear if you get it on your hands.</li>
<li> I had gotten some expensive extensions online for the first time, a couple years ago, and I was stoked.</li>
<li> Only use this on a tooth pick when I double my false eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
<li> They just didnt want to stay down.</li>
<li> The black glue will need to be either cut out or peeled out of the lace closure front.  </li>
<li> /&gt;PS - you can use it (apply with a q-tip) to apply false lashes too!just struggled until my arms were numb trying to gingerly untangle the gobs of black chewing-gum-like substance from my precious scalp.</li>
<li> But my hair looked fab, and besides a little discomfort, nobody was the wiser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> but after a few times using the glue on my extensions, i could not get the glue out at all.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d probably look like George Costanza if I had impatiently ripped them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;d probably look like George Costanza if I had impatiently ripped them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> so i was shocked when i purchased this one mistakenly and it dried black in my blonde hair.</li>
<li> Silly me just thought the bottle was black because there is nothing that says in the description that this is in fact black colored glue.  </li>
<li> but I Hardly have time to go to the beauty supply - so I purchased from this seller ; and THANK GOD ...</li>
<li> I mean for what it is, it does</li>
<li> i use this glue for my eyelashes and it works so well and last for ever, it does have a unpleasant smell</li>
<li> This glue is black in color, and very difficult to wash out of the closure.  </li>
<li> This Dried up glue that was impossible to use</li>
<li> the smell is not to bad you get use to it (not a strong smell)</li>
<li> Embarassing, randomly my edges would start to creep up and stick out.</li>
<li> /&gt;PS - you can use it (apply with a q-tip) to apply false lashes too!</li>
<li> Did I get a bad batch?</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> can u use this for adding on my own hair for mens mustaches? i need for temp wear for gold tees,stylish mustaches,etc</li>
    <li> I am a regular user of this pro bonding glue. It can be a finishing touch helper for a middle closure piece of a weave.</li>
    <li> Perfect for eyelash glue. Thank you</li>
    <li> I have a love/hate relationship with this stuff, and you know what? Bless the internet, I&#x27;m going to speak on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little tube has gone far above and beyond the package promises for me, and I&#x27;m sure many other beauty junkies know exactly what I mean. Extension glue can do so much, as long as it&#x27;s a decent quality one.

I had gotten some expensive extensions online for the first time, a couple years ago, and I was stoked. Finally, no more pack hair from the beauty supply, I got the good stuff like the pros do, and I was excited to install it. Since I spent so much on the extensions I went dirt cheap with the glue, the bottles for 99 cents at my local beauty supply. First thing I noticed that unless I put a metric ton of goop on tghe hair it wouldn&#x27;t stay in one place, either peeling up at the ends or just sliding into a slghtly different spot, even with careful, methodical application of the weft to my head. By the time I was done I had used up not one, but two bottles. The second bottle was nearly empty! But my hair looked fab, and besides a little discomfort, nobody was the wiser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the slips started. Embarassing, randomly my edges would start to creep up and stick out. They just didnt want to stay down. Then when I had enough after 3 weeks the epic struggle to remove the glue took 3 entire days. I couldn&#x27;t leave the house, go to work, nothing, just struggled until my arms were numb trying to gingerly untangle the gobs of black chewing-gum-like substance from my precious scalp.

    <li> its perfect. for its actual use -- or my roommate showed me how she uses this stuff instead of eyelash glue and its AMAZING for that.!!!! (she dips the handle of long eye make up brush into it and applys onto lashes. looks more natural, holds better. and the BEST PART....when u pull them off later u can then pull the glue right off the lashes! super easy! then their like new!!! reuse reuse reuse!)&lt;br /&gt;shipped super fast! would buy again :)</li>
    <li> Very good product for anyone who wears bonded weave.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second purchase and will not be my last.</li>
    <li> The glue above this one said it dried clear so i was shocked when i purchased this one mistakenly and it dried black in my blonde hair. People told me i had bugs in my hair. (my fault) Then the first time i washed my hair the extensions admittely came out but after a few times using the glue on my extensions, i could not get the glue out at all. Weeks (literally weeks) later and many hair washings later i still have huge chunks of latex glue stuck in my hair and have even lost a few chunks of hair in the process. I mean for what it is, it does it&#x27;s job but there is a lot to be desired.</li>
    <li> this is the only brand I have ever used only thing is they sent me the 30 sec one instead of the reg. one hopefully  it works the same.</li>
    <li> Silly me just thought the bottle was black because there is nothing that says in the description that this is in fact black colored glue.  There are the same products that state &amp;#34;black glue&amp;#34;, so I thought this wasn&#x27;t one of them because it&#x27;s not stated.  While I couldn&#x27;t use this glue with my hair color, it did arrive quickly - I wish they&#x27;d just change the description to add that it is black colored glue for the non hair pro&#x27;s like myself who don&#x27;t know any better.</li>
    <li> I love this bonding glue , I actually don&#x27;t wear extensions ; I use this for my eyelashes! And it&#x27;s a fantastic product. I&#x27;ve purchased hair glue online ONCE and it was a horrible experience ; the seller sent me This Dried up glue that was impossible to use and I was never refunded or anything the seller just ignored me. So I was pretty scared about doing it again but I Hardly have time to go to the beauty supply - so I purchased from this seller ; and THANK GOD ... It arrived new and able to use .. Just as advertised . The item got here safe ; The seller shipped the item within the timeframe indicated - shipping and handling costs were reasonable. HAPPY CUSTOMER HERE ! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟</li>
    <li> Great product for weaves.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping great size. Bought it for eyelashes. Smells awful at first but fine when dry. Works better than lash glue. Dries in a rubbery flexible finish. Notice less real eyelashes pulled out</li>
    <li> I found out about using weave glue for eyelash extensions for longer use of the lashes, so I decided to try. This one is the first glue i have used, i read comments below reading that someone else used it as well. So i decided to give it a try. WORKS GREAT! Doesnt last as long as i hoped, but does the job.</li>
    <li> I love this glue! i just started wearing hair extensions in my hair the smell is not to bad you get use to it (not a strong smell)</li>
    <li> i use this glue for my eyelashes and it works so well and last for ever, it does have a unpleasant smell but i can get over that for the hold it gives</li>
    <li> Great for putting false eyelashes on, or sticking gems to face or body. Holds for a long time, but black color does tend to smear if you get it on your hands.</li>
    <li> Product is as described in the ad, glue can last up to about 2 weeks, after that I would recommend washing it our and re-applying.</li>
    <li> WORKS WONDERS !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> great size for price. came on time.</li>
    <li> Only use this on a tooth pick when I double my false eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t know what you doing go to the mall they have expert to do this.</li>
    <li> Love this glue! Not only does it not leave residue on hair but it will dry completely and it very easy to remove. I used this glue to apply lashes and it worked great!</li>
    <li> GLUE IS SO, SO, SO MUCH BETTER THAN SEWING. RIGHT NOW I&#x27;M INTO MAKING WIGS AND IT IS SO MUCH EASIER TO USE THE GLUE. THEN TOUCH UP AT THE END.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me but this really doesn&#x27;t seem to work.  Whenever I try to bond/glue it just falls off.  Did I get a bad batch?</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  This is for bonding hair tracks not lace front closures.  This glue is black in color, and very difficult to wash out of the closure.  So be very careful and choose wisely.  I am glad I only used a tiny bit since I was trying a temporary fix until I could get to my hair dresser. And it did not bond tightly, only left the black residue.  Obviously, I purchased the wrong kind.  The black glue will need to be either cut out or peeled out of the lace closure front.  If you are buying it for something other than the &amp;#34;lace closure top&amp;#34; then it is probably ok!  Read to verify!</li>
    <li> I used this product before, from a different retailer, so knew what to expect! It was on point and good to work with!</li>
    <li> it came faster then expected. as for the product it is what I expected I have used this before and I think it does it job... thankyou</li>
    <li> is a very good glue. i did not pay for nothing.</li>
    <li> I have read many of these reviews here,  and I think all of these reviews for wigs and wig products are a HOOT!</li>
    <li> I always used this brand! :D! it&#x27;s awesome (even though it smells like booty) holds down my extensions, even when they get wet!</li>
</ol>
