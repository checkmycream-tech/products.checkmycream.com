### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>My husband finds this to be the best product yet.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s truly one of the best scents I&#x27;ve smelled on a mens&#x27; product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and this is the best performing one.</li>
      <li>Best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>Very good product.  </li>
      <li>It has very good fragrance though.</li>
      <li>Smells great though.</li>
      <li>Smells good too.</li>
      <li>is the best, hands down.&lt;br /&gt;Looks flawless, not greasy, not sticky, but no frizz or dry, fuzzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is my husbands favorite hair stuff, so I guess five stars is what it gets!</li>
      <li>So glad to have found it on Amazon!  </li>
      <li>Not oily, smells great, has a strong natural-looking hold with my wavy hair.</li>
      <li>This is amazing stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It also has a nice woody/pin smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Before my visit to my wife&#x27;s stylist I was a \\&quot;just get it cut at the barber and it will eventually look good\\&quot; kind of guy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too sticky on your fingers, and the masculine scent is excellent.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, I mostly buy it for the smell....</li>
      <li>I love most Aveda products</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, but waaaaay over priced.</li>
      <li>Wish I had more hair to warrant continued use. :)</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this is my favorite styling product.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair very manageable with a good unnoticeable hold and texture.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Using this, you can easily run your fingers through your hair, but your hair still remembers what you told it to do hours ago.</li>
      <li>It smells good, my hair stays in place but has a natural look to it.</li>
      <li>it smells like success!</li>
      <li>worth the price!</li>
      <li>tube is better than a canister because it comes out in an exact amount.</li>
      <li>so worth a try!</li>
      <li>He is very sensitive to most perfume</li>
      <li>Looks great after wearing it for a few hours.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was hoping for</li>
      <li>smells and this one has a very nice, subtle smell.  </li>
      <li>When I ran out, I got it on Amazon for much cheaper.</li>
      <li>I paid way too much money for this stuff at a fancy barber shop</li>
      <li>I have straight, average hair, and sport a longer hair style than most men.</li>
      <li>Pretty natural hold.</li>
      <li>Oddly enough, I think the solid version works in better.  </li>
      <li>this product lasts a VERY long time and gives a non-sticky hold that&#x27;s just right.</li>
      <li>It is a stronger hold than mousse, but still leaves your hair malleable (not stiff like hair</li>
      <li>Great goo if youve got at least a little length.</li>
      <li>I think the less viscous cream is absorbed into the hair faster</li>
      <li>My hair is very rough and dense and so it doesn&#x27;t stay in place very well.</li>
      <li>The price is high but one tube will last a very long time.  </li>
      <li>My only wish is that it came in a travel size, because this one is a little too large for my toiletries travel bag.</li>

    <li> My husband finds this to be the best product yet.</li>
    <li> my husband loves this product, uses it everyday, it grooms without looking stiff and keeps moisture in his hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never found anything better.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even used castor oil alone,&lt;br /&gt;olive oil,&lt;br /&gt;argan oil alone,&lt;br /&gt;and various Assorted Crew pomades, fiber, etc.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best, hands down.&lt;br /&gt;Looks flawless, not greasy, not sticky, but no frizz or dry, fuzzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, wavy hair that&#x27;s hard to manage.  This makes me look like a movie star.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  Medium hold.  I like all of the Aveda products that I have tried.</li>
    <li> This is my husbands favorite hair stuff, so I guess five stars is what it gets! I love most Aveda products so worth a try!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks now. My hair is very rough and dense and so it doesn&#x27;t stay in place very well. It has very good fragrance though.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this is my favorite styling product. I&#x27;ve tried American Crew, Woody&#x27;s, etc and this is the best performing one. It&#x27;s not too sticky on your fingers, and the masculine scent is excellent. It&#x27;s truly one of the best scents I&#x27;ve smelled on a mens&#x27; product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube is better than a canister because it comes out in an exact amount. The price is high but one tube will last a very long time.  My only wish is that it came in a travel size, because this one is a little too large for my toiletries travel bag.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair very manageable with a good unnoticeable hold and texture. Wish I had more hair to warrant continued use. :)</li>
    <li> I use this stuff every day. It holds well without making your hair look wet and feel sticky. It is a stronger hold than mousse, but still leaves your hair malleable (not stiff like hair spray).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this when my hair is longer than a couple of inches, and I use Aveda&#x27;s styling clay when my hair is shorter. They are fairly similar, but this is a bit softer of a hold than the clay.</li>
    <li> Great goo if youve got at least a little length. Doesnt give the wet look. Smells good too. I&#x27;ll be honest, I mostly buy it for the smell....becuause it smells like success!</li>
    <li> Oddly enough, I think the solid version works in better.  I think the less viscous cream is absorbed into the hair faster and I can&#x27;t work it around as well.  Five stars for the solid version!</li>
    <li> Not oily, smells great, has a strong natural-looking hold with my wavy hair. I don&#x27;t use anything else anymore.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since my wife recommended I get my hair cut by her stylist. I highly recommend it and have been using it ever since (a few years now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before my visit to my wife&#x27;s stylist I was a \\&quot;just get it cut at the barber and it will eventually look good\\&quot; kind of guy. I also used whatever hair gel was the cheapest at the store. I never liked it because it would make my hair extremely stiff, look unnatural, and if you ever touched your hair your hands would feel sticky even several hours after putting in the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any of these issues with the Aveda product. It smells good, my hair stays in place but has a natural look to it. I can touch my hair and not come away feeling like I was slimed by some alien creature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback I have is that this stuff is expensive. I obviously think it is worth it as I have been using it for years and have tried other alternatives in the mean time.</li>
    <li> worth the price! this product lasts a VERY long time and gives a non-sticky hold that&#x27;s just right. for no-fuss men who you typically wouldn&#x27;t expect to jump on the &amp;#34;hair product&amp;#34; bandwagon- this is the styling gel for you!</li>
    <li> I paid way too much money for this stuff at a fancy barber shop a while back. When I ran out, I got it on Amazon for much cheaper. It does its job. Not too aggressive or sticky of a hold. Looks great after wearing it for a few hours. Pretty natural hold.</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I think this must be what they use in movies.&lt;br /&gt;I hate gel, because it feels sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Using this, you can easily run your fingers through your hair, but your hair still remembers what you told it to do hours ago.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was hoping for</li>
    <li> This doesnt work so well on thick, curly hair. Smells great though.</li>
    <li> I have straight, average hair, and sport a longer hair style than most men. It&#x27;s difficult to find product to just keep my hair in a &amp;#34;controlled&amp;#34; state, without making it overly shiny, crusty, or stiff. This product keeps my hair loosely in place without making it seem unnatural, and at the same time doesn&#x27;t make my hair overly greasy. It also has a nice woody/pin smell.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve used.  Love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but waaaaay over priced.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product!  So glad to have found it on Amazon!  He is very sensitive to most perfume smells and this one has a very nice, subtle smell.  One of the few grooming products he uses.</li>
