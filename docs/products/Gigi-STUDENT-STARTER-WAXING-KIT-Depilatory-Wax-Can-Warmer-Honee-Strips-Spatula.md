      <li>Great kit,  the wife couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
      <li>the wax-off worked great</li>
      <li>Happy with it the waxing kit, the lid was cracked but they replaced it with no problem I would order again from this source</li>
      <li>The muslin strips weren&#x27;t great (hence the 4 stars).</li>
      <li>I am so happy I did because all the things it comes with help me</li>
      <li>This product works as good as when you go get it done at the spa.</li>
      <li>this is a good deal for the money</li>
      <li>and it is super convient to store best waxing kit ive come across yet</li>
      <li>Very nice and easy!</li>
      <li>So good luck girls:))</li>
      <li>I would recommend this for those who have the patience to do their own waxing and can follow instructions.</li>
      <li>any way I liked it..</li>
      <li>I liked this product and it is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t use it that often, but when I do it seems like a good way to clean the area.</li>
      <li>cuz my husband stairs to hert me:)</li>
      <li>I order the ultra senastive and hope that its better</li>
      <li>and you can do it more than once.</li>
      <li>I think even maybe I did a better job with this kit then the salon.</li>
      <li>how-to videos then was able to do it myself.</li>
      <li>- then it ought to work out better :)</li>
      <li>but this kit made it all relatively easy.</li>
      <li>It was easy to use and did the job well.</li>
      <li>The cloths worked fine too.</li>
      <li>quick shipping and does the job!</li>
      <li>The wax is great, the heater works great too, the strips work, the lotions are okay, not sure up to what point they are necessary, but its a nice bonus.</li>
      <li>I used this same brand before and it worked great</li>
      <li>I love this kit it came exactly as shown</li>
      <li>I do have to say that I did not care for the cloth wax strips and bought different ones because the wax would seep through but all in all this is a good kit.</li>
      <li>Other than that it works great</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend to anyone that isn&#x27;t familiar with doing their own waxing.  </li>
      <li>heating pot is great because it doesn&#x27;t cause a mess.</li>
      <li>The only thing about the warmer is that it does take some time to warm up</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product after weeks of searching for something decent to buy. :)</li>
      <li>It comes exactly as advertized.</li>
      <li>I am in love with the pre epilation powder, because it not only helped the wax from not staying on my skin but seems to help take the wax all the way off.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased, the wax is very sticky so be very careful and don&#x27;t drop any.</li>
      <li>Such a superior system will never go back to drug store waxes again.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not as fast to warm as other warmers I have had.</li>
      <li>So much easier, real fabric and wax, takes off all of the hair first try and doesn&#x27;t hurt your skin either.  </li>
      <li>I love the wax remover, because, thats always a problem, and the slow grow is nice too, especially because it seems to cool the area down after and make it feel better.</li>
      <li>But you really need to be using it on someone else or have someone who is going to use it on you.</li>
      <li>The wax can be very sticky.</li>
      <li>I got this complect because it&#x27;s much cheaper to get the warmer with everything else that was included..</li>
      <li>Its much cheaper</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to return the whole product, just wanted a new lid.</li>
      <li>I still have more than half the wax</li>
      <li>Just needs a little bit more instructions.</li>
      <li>I really liked this wax even though hard a bit to do it your self</li>
      <li>I have at least 2-3 more uses out of it</li>
      <li>I really like the product and it works great, was disappointed as I ordered it brand new and expected it to arrive in brand new condition; when it arrived the warmer lid was cracked.  </li>
      <li>I really like this bundle because if you bought everything separate it would be more expensive.</li>
      <li>Make sure to have old cloth or an old towel that you don&#x27;t mind getting dirty/ruined with the sticky wax since it is probably impossible to not drip a bit and the stuff is devlishly sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> If you are a first time waxer like I was, and think &amp;#34;how hard can this</li>
<li> comes with everything you need and lasts a long time.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used other waxing products and had to go over the waxed areas multiple times, which was a pain and time consuming.</li>
<li> I had to practice technique several times, but once I got that down, everything went well.</li>
<li> money well spent</li>
<li> the other hand, it certainly does remove hair (and a thin layer of skin</li>
<li> Other than that, everything works well.</li>
<li> Not sure if it actually makes it grow slower, but who knows.&lt;br</li>
<li> After using this kit though, I&#x27;m convinced that the other kits were just inferior.</li>
<li> So when i started to learn how to wax myself, I was only heating up my wax in a pot, which was getting very messy.</li>
<li> Took a few tries</li>
<li> but I have it down now.</li>
<li> I rubbed the floor with for half an hour to get rid of it</li>
<li> but, its still there leaving black spots on the floor..</li>
<li> All you need is a little guts.</li>
<li> I have to wax my entire body, and going to a waxer became expensive.</li>
<li> This wax is sticky, hard to manage and is really hard to remove.</li>
<li> This set sucks.</li>
<li> At least you think they work until you use something like Gigi.  </li>
<li> The kit comes with a cleanser, powder, wax off, and slow grow.</li>
<li> I rubbed my skin so badly that it turned red and was itching for 4-5 days</li>
<li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the kit.</li>
<li> but I had really really bad experience...</li>
<li> but this one is horrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I liked this product and it is very easy to use. Would reccomend to someone to purchase. Just needs a little bit more instructions.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on my friends suggestion ..she uses it and likes it .. but I had really really bad experience...it left my hands with irritation and rashes.. I faced 2 biggest problems..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I found its tooo sticky.. it doesnt get out of your skin even after applying wax off (it comes with in the kit only), washing  with soap and rubbing with loofah.. I rubbed my skin so badly that it turned red and was itching for 4-5 days..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  If its spilled on floor then just forget even to try for removing it.. I rubbed the floor with for half an hour to get rid of it but, its still there leaving black spots on the floor..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a novice at waxing at home but this kit made it all relatively easy. I had to practice technique several times, but once I got that down, everything went well. The cloths worked fine too. I have tried several OTC waxing kits and none of them seemed to work. I didn&#x27;t know if it was just me or the products. After using this kit though, I&#x27;m convinced that the other kits were just inferior. I would definitely recommend this kit to a friend!</li>
    <li> Great kit,  the wife couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It has everything you need to get started at home and save money</li>
    <li> This set sucks. It&#x27;s either the warmer or the honey. It takes almost an hour to heat up then when it heats up it doesn&#x27;t remove all the unwanted hair. I used this same brand before and it worked great but this one is horrible.</li>
    <li> quick shipping and does the job! I will continue using this product.  it grabs all the hair. the musilin strips do shed at the edges and get everywhere.</li>
    <li> The kit comes with a cleanser, powder, wax off, and slow grow. The wax works well in removing the hair off. I use it for my face, arms, and legs. The wax can be very sticky. Also, the kit doesn&#x27;t come with a post wax soothing gel so I would recommend purchasing aloe vera gel for that.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with the kit. It comes exactly as advertized. But you really need to be using it on someone else or have someone who is going to use it on you. Make sure to have old cloth or an old towel that you don&#x27;t mind getting dirty/ruined with the sticky wax since it is probably impossible to not drip a bit and the stuff is devlishly sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, it certainly does remove hair (and a thin layer of skin - don&#x27;t reapply!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep the kit for when I can have someone else help me or vice versus - then it ought to work out better :)</li>
    <li> Saves money by waxing at home. I purchased different strips becuase I did not like the cloth ones. Took a few tries but I have it down now.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to see the amount of each item in the kit.  I would definitely recommend to anyone that isn&#x27;t familiar with doing their own waxing.  Very nice and easy!</li>
    <li> loved it!  comes with everything you need and lasts a long time. I still have more than half the wax and I ordered it about three months ago</li>
    <li> This wax is sticky, hard to manage and is really hard to remove. This will just end up as a $40 wax warmer because I&#x27;m throwing out this crappy wax!</li>
    <li> I have to wax my entire body, and going to a waxer became expensive. So when i started to learn how to wax myself, I was only heating up my wax in a pot, which was getting very messy. I saw this kit online and got it. I am so happy I did because all the things it comes with help me so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pre epilation wash, I don&#x27;t use it that often, but when I do it seems like a good way to clean the area. I am in love with the pre epilation powder, because it not only helped the wax from not staying on my skin but seems to help take the wax all the way off. I love the wax remover, because, thats always a problem, and the slow grow is nice too, especially because it seems to cool the area down after and make it feel better. Not sure if it actually makes it grow slower, but who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heating pot is great because it doesn&#x27;t cause a mess. I would reccomend this kit to anyone who waxes themself.</li>
    <li> bought this for my daughter she loved it!  and I feel like you get a lot for your money! money well spent</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions. Other than that, everything works well. If you are a first time waxer like I was, and think &amp;#34;how hard can this be&amp;#34;, I suggest looking up a &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; on you tube.</li>
    <li> This kit has everything you need to get started waxing. It was easy to use and did the job well. I think even maybe I did a better job with this kit then the salon. All you need is a little guts.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased, the wax is very sticky so be very careful and don&#x27;t drop any. Other than that it works great and I would reccommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Happy with it the waxing kit, the lid was cracked but they replaced it with no problem I would order again from this source</li>
    <li> I gave this 5 stars because I the warmer has three settings and it came with everything you need. I do have to say that I did not care for the cloth wax strips and bought different ones because the wax would seep through but all in all this is a good kit. I received it within 4 days from ordering it and it was packed well. It also came with instructions on how to use the cleanser, wax remover, etc.. I would recommend this to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I love this kit it came exactly as shown and it is super convient to store best waxing kit ive come across yet</li>
    <li> I really liked this wax even though hard a bit to do it your self cuz my husband stairs to hert me:)) any way I liked it.. But one thing the lotions that comes with it did not work for me.. I got this complect because it&#x27;s much cheaper to get the warmer with everything else that was included.. So good luck girls:))</li>
    <li> I really like the product and it works great, was disappointed as I ordered it brand new and expected it to arrive in brand new condition; when it arrived the warmer lid was cracked.  I chose not to return as it still works and I didn&#x27;t want to return the whole product, just wanted a new lid.</li>
    <li> This is a deal! I really like this bundle because if you bought everything separate it would be more expensive. The only thing about the warmer is that it does take some time to warm up and it&#x27;s not as fast to warm as other warmers I have had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other waxing products and had to go over the waxed areas multiple times, which was a pain and time consuming. This product works as good as when you go get it done at the spa. Its much cheaper and you can do it more than once. I have at least 2-3 more uses out of it (Both legs were done). The wax is great, the heater works great too, the strips work, the lotions are okay, not sure up to what point they are necessary, but its a nice bonus. I would highly recommend this product after weeks of searching for something decent to buy. :)</li>
    <li> I would recommend this for those who have the patience to do their own waxing and can follow instructions. I looked up youtube how-to videos then was able to do it myself. The muslin strips weren&#x27;t great (hence the 4 stars). The wax seeped through the fabric and made my hands sticky. I had to double up the strips to stop the wax from getting onto my hands. The pre wax cleanser and powder helped take the pain away and the wax-off worked great (I will look into buying another bottle after this one is empty).&lt;br /&gt;The all-purpose wax it came with did it&#x27;s job. If you are looking to order this kit, I would order the non-woven strips at the same time because if you plan to wax &amp;#34;everything&amp;#34; (eyebrows, legs, underarms, brazilian) then the srips provided will not be enough.</li>
    <li> I have used lots of drugstore waxing (Sally Hansen for ex) and they work.  At least you think they work until you use something like Gigi.  So much easier, real fabric and wax, takes off all of the hair first try and doesn&#x27;t hurt your skin either.  Such a superior system will never go back to drug store waxes again.</li>
    <li> this is a good deal for the money the only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the wax it came with. I order the ultra senastive and hope that its better</li>
