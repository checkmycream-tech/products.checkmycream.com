      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>So buy it if you are  fair skinned and your trying to achieve that golden brown tan.</li>
      <li>Great price and shipped fast</li>
      <li>This is one of my most all time favorite tanning lotions ever.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t say for sure</li>
      <li>The smell is a lovely sandalwood vanilla scent, but it does have a strong DHA smell at times.</li>
      <li>I always liked this lotion because it smelled great before tanning and even hours later.</li>
      <li>It made my skin silky smooth and gave me a beautiful light brown tan that looked natural.</li>
      <li>Plus in a months time it has really helped create a nice healthy looking tan, not at all orange or streaky.  </li>
      <li>I would strongly recommend anyone to try it.</li>
      <li>The smell is fairly strong as well, though not unbearable.</li>
      <li>Perfect dark tan all over.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to find it online for a better price and still be the same great lotion.</li>
      <li>Smell is fine, texture is fine.</li>
      <li>Best part is, the price - on here is 50% less than at the salon.</li>
      <li>I think it could have a better smell and one that does not fade as quickly.</li>
      <li>Once I was maintaining a good tan I wanted to deepen it and have it still look very natural.  </li>
      <li>I prefer light scents but for the price I&#x27;m not too concerned about it</li>
      <li>I received it within a week and also got a sample packet of a ed hardy brand to try as well free of charge.</li>
      <li>but it does leave your skin feeling smooth and moisturized.</li>
      <li>I will always come to amazon for my tanning lotion needs as I always receive a quality, genuine product.  </li>
      <li>, overall it&#x27;s a great lotion</li>
      <li>so you have a healthy glow right out of the tanning bed.  </li>
      <li>I was using Luminary which I really liked (gave nice color, smelled great, little to no ATO and a great subtle shimmer)</li>
      <li>This lotion is great and gives you a deep bronze quickly.</li>
      <li>I love most Australian Gold products and maybe I&#x27;ll fall in love with this product too.</li>
      <li>Not only do I absolutely LOVE the smell, it works amazing.</li>
      <li>Gives you a really nice glowing tan, that looks natural!</li>
      <li>I have absolutely no complains and am incredibly happy with this product and the customer service.</li>
      <li>I love how it dispenses and you don&#x27;t need that much</li>
      <li>I really like this product, it goes on evenly and leaves my skin smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think this is the REAL Australian Gold.</li>
      <li>well worth it 100%</li>
      <li>I would buy this product again, but I wouldn&#x27;t go as far to say that I love it and am never using anything else ever again.</li>
      <li>So I would say this lotion is worth it.</li>
      <li>I have been wanting to buy this product since it came out but 120.00 for a months worth of lotion is pretty steep.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t get me as dark as I thought it would nor did it smell good.</li>
      <li>Clean smell, blends nicely, and gives a nice bronze tan after only a few uses in the tanning bed.</li>
      <li>This product works magic on your skin, but it will leave streaks if you&#x27;re not very careful.</li>
      <li>The after tan smell is not very bad and it makes your skin feel silky.</li>
      <li>Super fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Both Luminary and Gilded give my skin a satin smooth touch that I love and other people comment on</li>
      <li>The exact sale lotion as the tanning bed places sail for 1/3 the price I say</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now and I&#x27;m always dark. I love how it dispenses and you don&#x27;t need that much so it lasts forever. Smells good too !!</li>
    <li> I just got this lotion off amazon yesterday and it works. I was skeptical at first.  I have been using tmfao and didn&#x27;t care for it much. I just wasn&#x27;t getting dark. I swear I used gilded gold 1 time and got a good tan. I woke up used it went about my day and didn&#x27;t shower until I went to bed. The tan didn&#x27;t  wash off.  So I would say this lotion is worth it. The after tan smell is not very bad and it makes your skin feel silky. So buy it if you are  fair skinned and your trying to achieve that golden brown tan.</li>
    <li> I work for a tanning salon and even with a 50% discount this lotion is still way too expensive in the salon. However, it works! My skin tone is very fair so it&#x27;s hard for me to find lotion that either works, or doesn&#x27;t turn me seven shades of streaky orange. After using this lotion twice i&#x27;m already noticeably darker than i&#x27;ve ever been before. My only issue with the lotion is the smell. It&#x27;s supposed to not smell after you tan, however I think it just plain stinks before and after.</li>
    <li> i got a sample of this from my salon. I didnt care for the scent even before getting in the bed but after tanning i smelled gross and i would expect more from such an expensive lotion. Even $50 on amazon is alot considering its only 8 ounces. Definatly a waste of money unless your loaded and like smelling terrible.</li>
    <li> Ive bought this at salons for $125. Its the best I&#x27;ve ever used and so happy to find it at this price!!</li>
    <li> Amazing! I&#x27;m fair skinned. This lotion did wonders! It made my skin silky smooth and gave me a beautiful light brown tan that looked natural. LOVE.</li>
    <li> I love the product.  Great smell and has great bronzers in it.</li>
    <li> Love the product, came sealed and would have been obvious if it was opened. Super silky and smells very good. Gives you a really nice glowing tan, that looks natural! (I&#x27;m naturally very light skinned, freckles, etc.)</li>
    <li> They sell this at my salon for 125.00 are you kidding me, They told me not to buy it due to it could be fake, however I bought it and I LOVE IT, DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY AT THE SALON..</li>
    <li> I tan during my lunch break sometimes and my coworkers always compliment the way I smell when I come back with this lotion on.  Plus in a months time it has really helped create a nice healthy looking tan, not at all orange or streaky.  My only warning is to use a wet cloth and wipe it off your hands when you&#x27;re done tanning, otherwise you&#x27;ll get those funky orange-y creases in between your fingers.  Once I realized this, maybe after a couple times of doing it, I started wiping the creases and palms when I was done applying it and haven&#x27;t had any other issues like that since.  I started doing the same between my toes too, just in case!!</li>
    <li> My salon sold this brand for much more money, so I was glad to find this here!  Clean smell, blends nicely, and gives a nice bronze tan after only a few uses in the tanning bed.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it goes on evenly and leaves my skin smooth and silky. Best part is, the price - on here is 50% less than at the salon. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Gilded is my favorite tanning lotion of all time!  It has an abundance of self-tanners in the lotion, so it seems like your color lasts longer than with any other lotion.  I&#x27;ve found that I only have to tan once or twice a week to maintain my color.  The smell is a lovely sandalwood vanilla scent, but it does have a strong DHA smell at times.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful before use, but stinks after. Color was instant and looks natural! But be careful with white clothes it will stain them. This would be a good event tanner.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for years. I always purchased it at salon, but the new one I go to does not sell it. I&#x27;m not sure if this specific bottle is near expiration or what, but the consistency is much thicker and it doesn&#x27;t go on as nice as previous bottles. Usually one pump does an entire leg and thigh and with this bottle, I need 2-3 pumps. It also has a very different smell and the lotion color is lighter. I always liked this lotion because it smelled great before tanning and even hours later. This particular bottle smells terrible before and after tanning. It also turned the skin between my fingers orange after using it only twice. I was able to get most of the orange off with rubbing alcohol. I couldn&#x27;t find an expiration date on the bottle, maybe just a bad bottle?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been weary of purchasing tanning lotions online cause I&#x27;ve heard so many stories of people receiving fakes. I bought a sample of Gilded at my tanning salon and then purchased this bottle. Thy smell exactly the same and feel identicle so it&#x27;s safe to say I got an authentic product. I&#x27;ve only been using it a week so I can&#x27;t say for sure how well it works but it does leave your skin feeling smooth and moisturized. The smell is the only bad thing. It&#x27;s a rich, heavy smell, not light or flowery at all. I prefer light scents but for the price I&#x27;m not too concerned about it, overall it&#x27;s a great lotion and I would buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> To me this lotion works pretty well. I feel that it does give me a good color after 1-2 uses. I think it could have a better smell and one that does not fade as quickly. It DOES have the after tanning bed smell which does not bother me, but it might bother other people. It also does stain your hands if your not careful and will leave darker spots on you if not put on evenly. It has a thick consistency which I like. For the price I fell its a good lotion,  however I would not pay the salon prices for this. I will also add, that it came packaged well, but the main seal on the bottle was broken. I am not sure if this is the real deal or not, but it does work even if its not the actual product. I am happy with the results it has given me in the 4 times I have used it.  I would buy this product again, but I wouldn&#x27;t go as far to say that I love it and am never using anything else ever again. If your on the fence about it, I would say to give it a try.</li>
    <li> My Mother swears by this tanning bed lotion. She says it is much cheaper to purchase on Amazon than it is at the tanning salon. We have purchased a couple of times and will continue to purchase from Amazon!</li>
    <li> Was excited to find this product on here since its so expensive in tanning salons. Defiantly not worth what the salons sell it for. Didn&#x27;t get me as dark as I thought it would nor did it smell good.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing!! I received it within a week and also got a sample packet of a ed hardy brand to try as well free of charge.I don&#x27;t tan/hold color as easy as I&#x27;d like but this lotion has great bronzers that does the trick. Also has a great perfume/cologne smell before and after tanning.lI&#x27;ve also tried the australain gold brand sterling and love that just as much! Way chaper to purchase on amazon vs. the tanning salons!</li>
    <li> Not only do I absolutely LOVE the smell, it works amazing. It smells like a perfumed lotion, and I always get complimented after I tan...asking what kind of perfume I am wearing. If you like more of a subtle fragrance, this may not be for you.</li>
    <li> Great smell, great tan.  I will always come to amazon for my tanning lotion needs as I always receive a quality, genuine product.  Gilded is awesome and the dispense is designed so that you are able to use every bit of it.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money! Bought it, tried it, hated it! Not worth the price. . . So not worth it. Would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> The exact sale lotion as the tanning bed places sail for 1/3 the price I say well worth it 100%</li>
    <li> Great product for indoor tanning.  Gives you a deep dark tan.  A small amount goes a long way.  Would reccomend for anyone who wants a deep dark tan.  This is my second purchase &amp; I would buy again.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This has so much bronzer that it left me orange as if I were using a self-tanner.. :( I&#x27;m super disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to buy this product since it came out but 120.00 for a months worth of lotion is pretty steep. So I found the exact same product on amazon.com and saved 50%. The smell, texture and everything about it is exactly the same!!!! LOVE IT, will never buy lotion at PBT again, even though I did used to work there.</li>
    <li> After two weeks of tanning in a salon, I was not getting much color. This was DAILY tanning in preparation for a beach event. I tried this product and got noticeable results in 2 days, and after 4 days I&#x27;m tan. I paid $$$ in the salon and the price on Amazon is great. I didn&#x27;t like the smell at first but after awhile I went back to my Cypher product and after tan I smell BAD. I like the moisturizing effect of Gilded. I have to switch to Sterling now that I&#x27;m bronze enough, I just want to maintain this color.</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion ever! No streaks, no smell, instant dark color. I like it because there is a lot in the bottle. Super fast delivery.</li>
    <li> My favorite tanning lotion yet!</li>
    <li> Gilded is a great bronzer.  It has become my favorite product.  The price is amazing on here and I would not spend the money at salon prices.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using a bronzer, and so far I&#x27;m not impressed.  The only extra color I noticed was on my hands, like with a self- tanner.  It doesn&#x27;t have a typical tanning lotion smell, it&#x27;s more perfumey.  I actually prefer the tropical tanning lotion smell, so this was a negative for me, but may be a bonus for others.  I will try this lotion a few more times and update my review at that time.  I love most Australian Gold products and maybe I&#x27;ll fall in love with this product too.</li>
    <li> Gilded is my all time favorite tanning lotion.  I was so excited to find it online for a better price and still be the same great lotion.</li>
    <li> I am just finishing my first bottle of Gilded.  It is the fifth tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used.  I am using Gilded as a step 3.  I was fair skinned (blonde, blue eyes, freckles, pale skin) when I started tanning so it took months to build a solid base tan.  Once I was maintaining a good tan I wanted to deepen it and have it still look very natural.  I was using Luminary which I really liked (gave nice color, smelled great, little to no ATO and a great subtle shimmer) prior to Gilded.  Gilded gave me the deeper, richer color I was looking for and it was a noticeable difference after the first use.  I really like the smell of the lotion before tanning.  I do find the ATO a bit stronger than Luminiary and Gilded&#x27;s ATO  (after tan odor) is the only down side to the lotion.  Both Luminary and Gilded give my skin a satin smooth touch that I love and other people comment on how silky smooth my skin feels and how great my tan is.</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think this is the REAL Australian Gold. It was opened when I got it. And it DOES NOT accelerate tanning like Australian Gold I&#x27;ve bought at the salon.</li>
    <li> Great packaging. It is a decent lotion. Smell is fine, texture is fine. Does not seem to bronze me as well as the tanning salon employees said it would.</li>
    <li> Great price and shipped fast</li>
    <li> Product looked just like the bottle I paid $100  for in the salon. Thanks to Amazon I won&#x27;t waste my $ anymore. You will see results in the first use.</li>
    <li> Came fast, and works really good! Well worth it! :D The salon wanted to sell it to me for 100 dollars!</li>
    <li> Shipped on time with no problems.  Love this product.  After a few times tanning with it I am already considerably darker.  Love the smell of the lotion.  No problems with streaking or anything else.  Perfect dark tan all over.  Love it, would order again.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product it said brand new authentic and never opened!!! When I received it the seal was broken on the bottle so it had been opened and the &amp;#34;tanning lotion&amp;#34; smells like regular lotion not like the one they sell at the tanning salon! Highly disappointed!!!!</li>
    <li> Not worth the money! Not much lotion in this small bottle! Makes it look at lot bigger than it is!</li>
    <li> Bought this lotion for my daughter and were not pleased at all! very dissapointed. It turns you orange,not a very pleasant smell either. Contacted seller and they will not allow us to return it! Waste of $45.00!!</li>
    <li> I have only used it four times and already have a better tan than with any other brozer I&#x27;ve use</li>
    <li> Not only did this lotion give me the dark golden color I was looking for fast, it has also in the process made my skin extremely soft.</li>
    <li> I bought this in the salon on because I worry about getting a quality product from anywhere else. The product itself is awesome! Others have complained of a smell but I certainly have not experienced any odors. After one use and months of not tanning I noticed a clear change in my skin tone and it has only gotten better each time. I just purchssed my seond bottle and plan to continue using as long as I&#x27;m tanning!</li>
    <li> Def was not Gilded in the bottle.</li>
    <li> Love this tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> This product works magic on your skin, but it will leave streaks if you&#x27;re not very careful. It is also prone to turning dryer areas of your skin obviously darker (ie. hands, shoulders, feet). The smell is fairly strong as well, though not unbearable. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is worried about about their complexion while using tanning lotions, but those who do use this lotion need to apply it perfectly every time in order to avoid streaks. I won&#x27;t call this product a waste of money, as I will cautiously continue using it, but I do not expect I will be buying this lotion again in the future.</li>
    <li> This is one of my most all time favorite tanning lotions ever. I would strongly recommend anyone to try it. And the price is more then half of what the salon charges.</li>
    <li> This product provides a great tan and also has a cosmetic bronzer so you have a healthy glow right out of the tanning bed.  I recommend this for tanners of all experience levels and if you&#x27;re looking to add something to your \\&quot;collection\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Great product and seller! And it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I love the smell! Was not happy with the bleed off from your skin. After tanning there&#x27;s a residue that is left on your skin that rubs off onto your clothing. Kinda like make-up does. I still use it, just more careful.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great and gives you a deep bronze quickly. I love it. My only complaint is that it is thick and takes a while to get it rubbed in everywhere, but then again the thickness is probably a sign of good quality.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I had a very small issue with the product and the seller IMMEDIATELY resolved the issue. I am hands down going to be purchasing this product again. Super fast shipping. I have absolutely no complains and am incredibly happy with this product and the customer service.</li>
    <li> I love gilded. By far the best tanning lotion for smell and for the bronze color you get from it. Great seller.</li>
