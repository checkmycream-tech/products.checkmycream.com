      <li>This is excellent quality.</li>
      <li>Smells great!</li>
      <li>Excellent stuff.&lt;br</li>

      <li>They burn and smell great.</li>
      <li>These smell great.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>If you have no fireplace, or a gas fireplace, this is a great thing to have around the house for those times</li>
      <li>The added burner in the set was a nice treat!</li>
      <li>Good deal.</li>
      <li>Love the scent!</li>
      <li>and I love it!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I would recommend to purchase the variety pack first to find out which scent you like the best.</li>
      <li>Has a nice terra cotta holder.</li>
      <li>I bought the cedar kind</li>
      <li>Make sure you have a good lighter.  </li>
      <li>Lots of cedar incense sold at amazon is junk, but these are the best by far.</li>
      <li>You just can&#x27;t go wrong with Santa Fe incense, it smells wonderful, the bricks burn thoroughly, and fill the house with a wonderful scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, upon burning, they take on a most lovely scent of a roaring fireplace.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve scorched my fingers once or twice when setting a lit one onto the saucer, but that&#x27;s more operator error than a product problem.</li>
      <li>the pi&amp;ntilde;&amp;oacute;n and more of it for a better price...</li>
      <li>and when inside, I light one up with my gas fireplace to make it feel more like woodburning</li>
      <li>It is a bit strong and smoky.</li>
      <li>I am more successful using a wooden kitchen match or a lighter to get these going.</li>
      <li>They used primarily pinon pine and cedar.</li>
      <li>They smell rather indistinctly of wood, not of any particular kind or provenance, but just a compressed powder of wood pulp.</li>
      <li>The Cedar (Alder&#x27;s my favorite) is slightly sweet and tangy and very woody.</li>
      <li>If you like a natural wood scent with very earthy, rich undertones, this is a good choice.</li>
      <li>The cedar incense has a clean, fresh, balsam scent.</li>
      <li>Great for outside use, but a bit much for indoor use.</li>
      <li>Delivered quickly, smells great, but the logs are hard to light.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ordered these twice so far and love them.</li>
      <li>I use a cigarette lighter to light these sticks/logs, which stand up fine on any flat surface.</li>
      <li>Brings me back to wood fires in Colorado early in the morning when the world was all bright and crisp</li>
      <li>and I was many years younger.</li>
      <li>Since my initial order, I have placed four more.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something where I could get more for my money with the same quality.</li>
      <li>It burns for maybe 15 minutes and smells exactly like the indicated wood variety (since it is made of real, compressed sawdust of that type).</li>
      <li>the smell is strong and lasting.</li>
      <li>My real fire fireplace has everything but the scent of real fire burning this takes away that completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have a Real Fire fireplace.</li>
      <li>There are several varieties you can combine or alternate for your own preference.</li>
      <li>Quite simply, I hold one end of the cedar stick above a lighter flame until the stick holds its own brief flame and thereafter I blow on the stick to ensure a continuous ember (a reddish glow like a cigarette, I suppose).</li>
      <li>Then you toss it into a bowl filled with sand or other sturdy incense burner.</li>
      <li>Even though it will smell terrific, it might be a bit too much \\&quot;reality\\&quot; in an enclosed space!  </li>
      <li>must be old stuff.</li>
      <li>The scent is that of a typical fireplace or wood stove and; yes, there is a modicum of smoke - it is an ember after all - however not so much that I am concerned about my PC workstations.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> must be old stuff.Does not smell anything like it should. No resemblance to cedar wood or to any smell of wood for that matter. Product may not be suited for purchase on the web. I&#x27;ll buy in future only on location preferable in the southwest.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly, smells great, but the logs are hard to light.  Make sure you have a good lighter.  This is not a reflection of the people who provide the product.</li>
    <li> the smell is strong and lasting. I like lighting one up when in the Jacuzzi to get the feel of the outdoors. and when inside, I light one up with my gas fireplace to make it feel more like woodburning</li>
    <li> Once I tried this product, I could not go back to any other type of incense. Love the scent! My boyfriend is hooked now also.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have a Real Fire fireplace. My real fire fireplace has everything but the scent of real fire burning this takes away that completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;convient,&lt;br /&gt;masks the chemical scent&lt;br /&gt;natural&lt;br /&gt;comes in variety of scents&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t last for the entire burn, must burn a few of them throughout the burn&lt;br /&gt;little difficult to start the burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to purchase the variety pack first to find out which scent you like the best.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Has a nice terra cotta holder. Good deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I had expected of these bricks. Perhaps that they smell like cedar prior to burning?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, they don&#x27;t. They smell rather indistinctly of wood, not of any particular kind or provenance, but just a compressed powder of wood pulp. Not entirely untoward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, upon burning, they take on a most lovely scent of a roaring fireplace. Excellent stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t last for long, and I had to auger out the burner a bit to help the bricks stay upright during the burn (which is short).</li>
    <li> These smell great. I am more successful using a wooden kitchen match or a lighter to get these going. Paper matches work for me about half of the time. I&#x27;ve scorched my fingers once or twice when setting a lit one onto the saucer, but that&#x27;s more operator error than a product problem.</li>
    <li> The added burner in the set was a nice treat! Didn&#x27;t realize it came with that.  The incense is terrific.</li>
    <li> Since my initial order, I have placed four more. My home office has no fireplace yet in the winter, the scent of a wood-burning fireplace contributes to my concentration. The scent is that of a typical fireplace or wood stove and; yes, there is a modicum of smoke - it is an ember after all - however not so much that I am concerned about my PC workstations. I have not bought other incense products so any difficulty in lighting I cannot estimate. Quite simply, I hold one end of the cedar stick above a lighter flame until the stick holds its own brief flame and thereafter I blow on the stick to ensure a continuous ember (a reddish glow like a cigarette, I suppose).</li>
    <li> If you have no fireplace, or a gas fireplace, this is a great thing to have around the house for those times you want that wood-burning scent in your home. The Cedar (Alder&#x27;s my favorite) is slightly sweet and tangy and very woody. I use a cigarette lighter to light these sticks/logs, which stand up fine on any flat surface. In fact, I flip the incense holder that comes with these incense sticks upside down, revealing the flat underside, and can stand up to four lit incense logs on it at the same time.</li>
    <li> Lots of cedar incense sold at amazon is junk, but these are the best by far. I&#x27;ve ordered these twice so far and love them.</li>
    <li> They burn and smell great.</li>
    <li> Brings me back to wood fires in Colorado early in the morning when the world was all bright and crisp and I was many years younger.</li>
    <li> It is a bit strong and smoky. Great for outside use, but a bit much for indoor use. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is excellent quality. I discovered this when I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Tamaya Resort in Albuquerque. They use several varieties of this wood incense in common areas to give the scent of wood fireplaces, since all their fireplaces are gas. They used primarily pinon pine and cedar. For two days I was trying to figure out which fireplace was the wood burning one. This lights best using a butane lighter for about a minute on one end. Then you toss it into a bowl filled with sand or other sturdy incense burner. It burns for maybe 15 minutes and smells exactly like the indicated wood variety (since it is made of real, compressed sawdust of that type). Just like a wood burning fireplace, the scent lingers in a room for a couple days thereafter. A side benefit is that the carbon particles from the smoke will neutralize other odors (cooking, stale house, etc.), not just mask odors. The cedar incense has a clean, fresh, balsam scent. There are several varieties you can combine or alternate for your own preference. I suggest the sampler pack from the same manufacturer if you haven&#x27;t tried this before. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> Anyone that has ever burned the pi&amp;ntilde;&amp;oacute;n incense from NM, well this stuff is just as comparable and yummy smelling.  I was looking for something where I could get more for my money with the same quality. .. well this it! I bought the cedar kind and I love it!  To me it&#x27;s just as great as the pi&amp;ntilde;&amp;oacute;n and more of it for a better price... woohoo!</li>
    <li> These bricks smell absolutely wonderful, especially on a cold winter evening.  This is the second batch I&#x27;ve ordered and I&#x27;ll order more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, if you burn one in a smallish space, you may get run out of the room by the smoke.  Even though it will smell terrific, it might be a bit too much \\&quot;reality\\&quot; in an enclosed space!  Still, that&#x27;s a manageable issue.  If you like a natural wood scent with very earthy, rich undertones, this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong with Santa Fe incense, it smells wonderful, the bricks burn thoroughly, and fill the house with a wonderful scent.</li>
