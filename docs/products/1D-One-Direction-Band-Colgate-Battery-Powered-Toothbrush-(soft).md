      <li>It&#x27;s still going strong</li>

      <li>While my daughter does enjoy looking at the cute boys at toothbrushing time, we were both disappointed that the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t play a song.</li>

    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well, sometimes the on button works and sometime you have to play with it to get it to turn on.  I thought it played music like tooth tunes.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this!</li>
    <li> I found this at big lots for 2 bucks. I thought it plays music while brushing. But no. Still a cool brush. Bought it for some one else</li>
    <li> great stocking stuffer</li>
    <li> Thought it had music. Bought another one at Walmart that did. Not worth the $</li>
    <li> It broke after 1 day.</li>
    <li> This was a great stocking stuffer for Christmas! It&#x27;s still going strong and she still loves it! And still have not had to replace batteries!</li>
    <li> Christmas gifts for 2 granddaughters - they love all things One Direction!</li>
    <li> disappointing, you can not change the head</li>
    <li> I was really happy with the toothbrush!! I love looking at one direction and everything. But i was a little disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t sing. But either way it is amazing.</li>
    <li> I assumed that this was the 1D toothbrush (made by another brand?) that plays music.  While my daughter does enjoy looking at the cute boys at toothbrushing time, we were both disappointed that the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t play a song.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for my daughter&#x27;s friend. She was absolutely thrilled. She is a big One Direction fan!</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s just a toothbrush. I honestly thought it played music.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed because I thought it was going to be like the one I bought her last year that played a 2 minute song and it does not play any song at all.</li>
