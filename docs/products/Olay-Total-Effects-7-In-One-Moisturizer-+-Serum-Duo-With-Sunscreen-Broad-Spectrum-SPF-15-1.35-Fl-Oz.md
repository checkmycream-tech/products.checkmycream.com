      <li>And this has the good broad-spectrum protectants you want in a sunscreen.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Maybe good for others, not for me</li>
      <li>/&gt;To be fair</li>
      <li>Good product,</li>
      <li>maybe if I didn&#x27;t take good care of my skin</li>
      <li>I am giving it 4 stars because it feels lovely on my skin and goes beautiful with the make-up again</li>
      <li>You would think a product with so many claims could never accomplish them all, but Olay does what it says!</li>
      <li>I love that it has sunscreen in it!  </li>
      <li>liked the smell.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice moisturizer/sunscreen to wear under my foundation and having anti-aging properties</li>
      <li>The moisturizer is clean feeling, non-greasy, didn&#x27;t clog my pores and the sunscreen is great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to use alone or under the makeup, specially during the Winter when we forget that the sun is still out there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It is a very nice texture and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>I love being able to go to one bottle and get the effects of three or more!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Instantly gives skin a healthy radiance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Olay makes some of the best of these products and appears to have combined the benefits several of skin products with a combination lotion and sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay</li>
      <li>The make-up properties are interesting.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, pleased with the product</li>
      <li>appears more youthful and has a radiance&lt;br /&gt;Minimizes pore appearance</li>
      <li>My skin has become moist but not greasy, more elastic, the texture is something I thought I&#x27;d never see in my life, and the tone has evened out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love Olay products and at my age, I feel like I need them.</li>
      <li>Mostly.</li>
      <li>,  I noticed more of a difference on my hands than face.  </li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, pleased with the product</li>
      <li>but if you DO want sunscreen, wouldn&#x27;t you want more than a 15 SPF?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this would have happened anywhere</li>
      <li>I love Olay products.</li>
      <li>I love the feel of this moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>My wife&#x27;s comments about this product are that she likes it, she wishes she could have more</li>
      <li>I put it on, and my makeup goes on more evenly.</li>
      <li>Maybe :)  </li>
      <li>Plus I love the fact that the sunscreen is built in.</li>
      <li>Definitely magic in a bottle.  </li>
      <li>I think if you need a robust sunscreen you might be better choosing a product that you could apply more liberally.</li>
      <li>I was pleased with all that this claims to do.</li>
      <li>I love how this makes my skin feel.  </li>
      <li>It seems to act as a sunscreen more than anything else.</li>
      <li>Olay Total Effects  7 in One Moisturizer is another excellent product from Olay.</li>
      <li>do have to say that the moisturizer balances skin tone, which means that you get a more uniform color of skin.  </li>
      <li>the loose powder would cover it beautifully if applied right away of course .... and together it just gave me this healthy beautiful glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>think it does a pretty good</li>
      <li>So, if you use Olay products and they work fine for you, this moisturizer/sunscreen might work okay as well.</li>
      <li>Overall, I thought it was a very good product.</li>
      <li>I love this for light makeup days</li>
      <li>I love this lotion because it has built in SPF, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and feels light when you put it on.  </li>
      <li>so you have to make sure that you smooth it into your skin well.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps in the right lighting conditions, the moisturizer helps to reduce the sight of the lines, but honestly, I don&#x27;t notice any difference.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice silky feel and rubs in pretty easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>claims to:&lt;br /&gt;Visibly reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles</li>
      <li>It appears that Olay has incorporated those features in this product, which accounts for benefit #1 and it might have something to do with #3, since contracting skin, which reduced wrinkles and fine lines, would also decrease pore size.  </li>
      <li>also has a product, which I did not go out and look up, that supposedly reduces wrinkles and fine lines.  </li>
      <li>There was no improvement in my pores, redness, fine lines or even dryness</li>
      <li>(I am in my mid-30&#x27;s and have fine lines, I can still see them, but they may appear less)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>Lines and Wrinkles - Visibly reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It absorbs relatively quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking oily, just healthy.</li>
      <li>The moisturizer rubs on smoothly and absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Has a &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; smell to it (I prefer the fragrance free version for this reason).</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and it leaves my skin smooth and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>This moisturizer is creamy, with a light scent, and goes on evenly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightly scented, but not too obnoxious.</li>
      <li>This one feels silky smooth and doesn&#x27;t go on greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly, I had no reaction to it (sometimes my eyes are bothered by products), and was packaged well.</li>
      <li>If you have very light skin, you can see the moisturizer when you first apply it, but as you spread it out, the color evens out and eventually your skin looks \\&quot;natural.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>the higher SPF is very important to me.  </li>
      <li>The product smells nice, mainly like sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>Nowadays, most people prefer to travel light and this Olay Total Effects 7 is a perfect solution for women who need lotions on a daily basics (like my mom).</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will be interested to see if it makes my skin too greasy in the summer, but right now, in the harshest time of winter, it has just been amazing.</li>
      <li>I have noticed that the tonal qualities of my face is more consistent.  </li>
      <li>I am never disappointed.</li>
      <li>Probably because cheeks were no longer dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winter is great time to test moisturizers and this winter the air has been particularly dry.  </li>
      <li>the positive side, it did minimize my pores, and it worked okay as a moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>The moisturizing effect is good, the product contains enough oil that is does hydrate and prevent drying of the skin.  </li>
      <li>moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the true test of any product is, would you buy it after you try it?  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product makes my skin so soft, and smooth I love it.  I use it everyday. A little goes a long way. People have told me my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price - Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this moisturizer.  the bottle is very small, but it doesn&#x27;t require much per application.  Just wish it would dry up my oily skin.</li>
    <li> Definitely magic in a bottle.  Like it.  The texture is perfect and the difference in my face is noticeable.  Just needs to be constant in using it and that s it!</li>
    <li> This product has sunscreen so you have to make sure that you smooth it into your skin well.  I works great on wrinkles but not fine lines.  It also has a great smell.</li>
    <li> SUPER FAST SHIPPING. PERFECT !!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it is helping with skin discoloration on my face and my skin pores are looking a lot smaller. It is perfect under my foundation makeup and I don&#x27;t seem to be as oily in the afternoon, even on a hot summer day, as I do with other products. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have bought many of the olay total effects line in the past and had no problems. My favorite being olay total effects 7 moisturizer with tint. This was the first one with serum I had tried, that&#x27;s the only thing different I can think of that might have made a difference. It caused me to break out in hives after 2-3 applications. They were so bad that i had to get a shot at the hospital to remedy them. Benedryl did not help at all.  Please know this is not a reflection on the seller. I&#x27;m sure this would have happened anywhere I would have bought this product. It came sealed and packaged perfectly.</li>
    <li> I really expected more from Olay as my mom is a loyal fan but this did not work well on me. First off the smell is reminiscent of cold cream which I did not enjoy. The second is that it does go on smooth but stays on with a greasy feeling. There was no improvement in my pores, redness, fine lines or even dryness which was my main concern. It seems to act as a sunscreen more than anything else. Maybe it will work for others but I definitely would not pay the high price for this product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the olay products. I am never disappointed.</li>
    <li> Perfect stuff!!! I use it daily and at 55 years of age, I have no wrinkles or lines showing up where I would have by now expected them to.... The first bottle was broken due to very ill-conceived packaging. The second bottle was packaged the same way, but survived the trip.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about 2 weeks. My favorite thing is the soft, fullness of my skin. I have an extremely simple \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; regimen, and I love that this has sunscreen and the anti-aging stuff. It is a very nice texture and absorbs quickly. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Olay Total Effects 7 in One is a silky feeling moisturizer that also provides SPF 15 sunscreen.  The active ingredients listed on the box are the following:&lt;br /&gt;Avobenzone (Sunscreen)&lt;br /&gt;Homostate (Sunscreen)&lt;br /&gt;Octisalate (Sunscreen)&lt;br /&gt;Octocrylene (Sunscreen)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the moisturizer for about a month or so on my slightly dry skin, I have come to the following conclusions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft silky feeling skin&lt;br /&gt;Skin appears more youthful and has a radiance&lt;br /&gt;Minimizes pore appearance&lt;br /&gt;*May* have slightly reduced the appearance of fine lines (I am in my mid-30&#x27;s and have fine lines, I can still see them, but they may appear less)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have breakouts (mild) at the beginning of using this moisturizer, but it seems my skin has gotten used to it.  I do not have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;It seems like if I put my foundation on it was flaking the moisturizer a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;Have to be careful around the eyes (where most of my lines are) my eyes are a little sensitive to this formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I like the moisturizer and will continue using.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this through the Amazon Vine program to review.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice moisturizer/sunscreen to wear under my foundation and having anti-aging properties never hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is very nice and the pump works well.  The product smells nice, mainly like sunscreen.  The moisturizer rubs on smoothly and absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination sensitive skin that breaks out easily though and this product just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I put it on in the morning and by afternoon my skin was starting to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that but it was very greasy.  My foundation was almost melting off of my face this product was so greasy.  I wanted to use this in the summer months because of the sunscreen, but this is incredibly greasy on my dry skin in the dry MN winter...I can&#x27;t imagine what would happen if I wore this in the humid summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in the health of my skin or reduction of wrinkles..of course I didn&#x27;t use it very long.  It took about a week to recover from the breakout caused by my one day use of this product.  So, for now, my search for a moisturizer/sunscreen continues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think those with incredibly dry skin might find this a useful product.  I would recommend those with sensitive skin look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair I&#x27;ve had trouble with Olay products breaking out my skin in the past.  So, if you use Olay products and they work fine for you, this moisturizer/sunscreen might work okay as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oil of Olay products since my dermatologist / skin care beautician best childhood friend praised them in 2010. I had been all over expensive skin care and then down to a healthy brand I was buying at my local Whole Foods and she talked about all the research and development behind the Olay line and I started out with their Regenerist moisturizer and I loved it. Rather, my skin loved it. I use Bare Minerals line for make-up and the loose powder would cover it beautifully if applied right away of course .... and together it just gave me this healthy beautiful glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was anxious to try this new product from Olay. I am giving it 4 stars because it feels lovely on my skin and goes beautiful with the make-up again but I am just a tad bit disappointed that it has only SPF of 15. We need more sun protection and that&#x27;s very low even though our make-up adds a little bit; that&#x27;s my only regret! Otherwise: LOVE this new Olay product.</li>
    <li> Have been using this ever since it cameon the market. And will not change it for anything else out there. And the price is just perfect for me as well :)</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my wife to use and this is her review: I have been using Oil of Olay products for several years and really like them. I had been using the Regenerist line, so the Total Effects line was new to me. I was pleased with all that this claims to do. I liked having 7 facial helps in one product, especially the sunscreen. It goes on smoothly, I had no reaction to it (sometimes my eyes are bothered by products), and was packaged well. Overall, I thought it was a very good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay products for many years, and every time a new Olay product comes out, I usually give it a try, but I always go back to Olay Regenerist moisturizer, which is my favorite of their products and in my personal opinion the best.&lt;br /&gt;That been said, after trying the Olay Total Effects 7 In One Moisturizer, I will use both from now on. I like how Olay Total Effects 7 feels on my skin and that its performance lasts all day. It&#x27;s great to use alone or under the makeup, specially during the Winter when we forget that the sun is still out there.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product without makeup during a very cold day, and when I went for a walk, my face was frozen, but my skin wasn&#x27;t achy due to dryness. And after a few minutes inside the house, I didn&#x27;t need to apply more, the moisture level on my skin was all right for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I tested the Total Effects 7 in on my face and hands.  I applied the lotion/serum on the right side of my face and on 1/2 of each hand (because my skin near the thumbs tends to be more wrinkly than the outside and I wanted to compare &#x27;apples to apples&#x27;).  What follows are my observations versus what Olay says this product will accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)Lines and Wrinkles -- Surprisingly (at least to me),  I noticed more of a difference on my hands than face.  On my face, I didn&#x27;t notice a reduction of tiny lines (you know those little &#x27;happy&#x27; creases at the corner of the eye).  I did, however, notice a big difference on my hands.  Perhaps it&#x27;s more dramatic because our dishwasher recently broke and we&#x27;re waiting for parts and I&#x27;ve been torturing my hands doing the dishes for four people, 2 dogs and an ancient cat.  In any case, you could definitely determine a difference between the lotioned and un-lotioned sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)Loss of Firmness -- I didn&#x27;t notice anything obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)Visible Pores -- I didn&#x27;t notice anything obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)Uneven Tone -- Possible improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5)Uneven Skin Texture -- Didn&#x27;t notice any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6)Dryness -- definitely.  The Olay Effects 7 not only made my face stop feeling dry and itchy, it also protected it when I went outdoors for walks.  When it&#x27;s as cold as it&#x27;s been, and the wind&#x27;s blowing I usually come in with chapped skin.  Didn&#x27;t happen with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7)Dullness -- I found reduced dullness.  Probably because cheeks were no longer dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winter is great time to test moisturizers and this winter the air has been particularly dry.  What I observed was that this lotion-serum provided good protection, although I would hardly say that it&#x27;s a miracle cure for aging skin.  I speculate that the effects might be more dramatic during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the smell.  It was scented much like some of the suntan lotions I use, and it wasn&#x27;t overpowering.  The creme itself was thick and I thought ever-so-slightly gritty: again like creme suntan lotions that contain coco-butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was going to put it on under a foundation, I would plan on waiting for it be absorbed and dry a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, pleased with the product BUT I would not pay an exorbitant price for it.me itself was thick and I thought ever-so-slightly gritty: again like creme suntan lotions that contain coco-butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was going to put it on under a foundation, I would plan on waiting for it be absorbed and dry a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, pleased with the product BUT I would not pay an exorbitant price for it.</li>
    <li> Olay products never fail, in my opinion. I&#x27;ve been using them for years, and never been disappointed. In fact, my mother has been using them for years, and has always recommended their products. So, I really wasn&#x27;t surprised when I tried Olay Total Effects 7 in One Moisturizer and Serum Duo, and loved it. You would think a product with so many claims could never accomplish them all, but Olay does what it says! The moisturizer is clean feeling, non-greasy, didn&#x27;t clog my pores and the sunscreen is great. I love being able to go to one bottle and get the effects of three or more! Olay does it again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several weeks and like other Olay products I have used it does what it says it does.  For two years I have used Olay Regenerist moisture face cream at night but I needed something with an SPF factor for day wear.  Olay Total Effects 7 gives me that needed sunscreen plus the moisturizer my skin craves. As an added incentive to keep using this product, a person just the other day commented on how my skin is so wrinkle free for my age (68 years). I do credit the Olay products for this result.</li>
    <li> Skincare is becoming complex with individual applications and now new combinations of products.  Olay Total Effects is an example of the latter, combining skin cream with sunscreen.  There are other products on the market, but this one combines the proven results of Oil of Olay with sufficient sunscreen for most people.  The 1.35 fl oz size, while fitting within airline carry on requirements, is quickly consumed so you may want to consider a larger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good combination for people looking to protect their skin from the ravages of time and sun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay products for years now. Prior to using Olay Total Effects, I used the no frills Olay moisturizer with SPF 15 (non-anti-aging). So I was intrigued by this particular product, especially for its claim to address the seven signs of aging.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, and I have found the right size of the cream to use is about three pumps of the tube.  Anything more, you will notice that the moisturizer is a bit on the heavy side.  You&#x27;ll have to do a little trial and error to determine how much to use.  As mid-30-something year old, I have developed fortunately only a few lines on my forehead and one smile line.  I haven&#x27;t seen any changes in my wrinkles after moisturizing.  Perhaps in the right lighting conditions, the moisturizer helps to reduce the sight of the lines, but honestly, I don&#x27;t notice any difference.  I do have dry facial skin, especially during the winter months.  The moisturizer does its job very well to hydrate my face.  I have noticed that the tonal qualities of my face is more consistent.  As for firming my skin, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference, nor has the product reduced the size or even the sight of my pores (I do have noticeable pores).  The price of the product is a bit steep for a product that works a lot like the no-frills Olay moisturizer that I had been using prior to this one.</li>
    <li> My mom usually has to a few bottles of lotion that she uses everyday. When she goes out, she needs sunblock. At night, she needs body lotion. And when the weather is dry, she needs moisturizer. There&#x27;s no problem with it until she travels. Nowadays, most people prefer to travel light and this Olay Total Effects 7 is a perfect solution for women who need lotions on a daily basics (like my mom). It works as advertised, nothing to complain about. When you have an all-in-one thing, you&#x27;ll gain convenience. However, there&#x27;s always a trade off. And in this case, it&#x27;s money. The product is a little pricier than stand-alone Olay products. So, it&#x27;s all up to you. I would recommend you have one for travel and use the stand-alone products on daily basics.</li>
    <li> I thought my wife might like this product as it contains moisturize and sunscreen all in one.  It reminded me of a product she was watching an infomercial on TV with some French guy out in the fields picking melons to put in the skin cream.  This product is of the same category but not as expensive as the TV one.  There is only one problem, she really doesn&#x27;t like the smell of the product.  She put it on, didn&#x27;t care of the smell, and said she could smell it all day.  Others may not have the same issue as she is sensitive to smell but something to keep in mind.</li>
    <li> Olay appears to be trying to provide one product with a multitude of purposes.  Moisturizing, make-up and sun screen.  The moisturizing effect is good, the product contains enough oil that is does hydrate and prevent drying of the skin.  The make-up properties are interesting.  If you are light skinned by the time you thin this product on your skin I would not trust the SPF-15 claim.  I think if you need a robust sunscreen you might be better choosing a product that you could apply more liberally. Maybe good for others, not for me</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it is the sensitivity of my skin or that this item has been sitting in the storage for years and waiting to be sold online, but immediately after i applied the moisturizer i felt a burning sensation and itchiness on my face. I have to wash it off right away and reapply what my usual moisturizer. If you have sensitive skin, please no not purchase this item. Or just dont purchase skincare products from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m biased, the women in my family have used Olay products for generations. This is the best one yet! The formula feels wonderful on the face, smooth and non-greasy. My face looks (and feels) great after application, I also like that there is little to no shine on most days. Great product</li>
    <li> Thick and creamy but not greasy.  I like it.</li>
    <li> + I am horrible at remembering to put on any type of sunscreen, so that it&#x27;s included in this moisturizer is a definite bonus for me (just daily errands type of being in the sun, not sunbathing or anything).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ I love the pump and how it empties from the top (like other products from Olay) so you don&#x27;t have to store it upside down towards the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ It has a nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ It has a nice silky feel and rubs in pretty easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ You only need maybe a pea-sized amount so the bottle should last long, which is good because...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now and don&#x27;t notice any major differences in my skin like evening my skin tone or decreasing my pores--but I&#x27;m guessing it takes longer than two weeks. But I still really like it so it gets four stars.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer and was able to tell a difference in my skin after several days. This moisturizer is thick, and to me that&#x27;s a sign that it is a good moisturizer. Also, a little goes a long way, versus other less thick moisturizers I have used. I put it on, and my makeup goes on more evenly. Plus I love the fact that the sunscreen is built in.</li>
    <li> My wife never met an Olay product she didn&#x27;t like.  Using Olay is definitely always better than doing nothing.  My wife&#x27;s comments about this product are that she likes it, she wishes she could have more (Amazon is OOS at the moment), and that she felt like it minimizes wrinkles and made her skin feel soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the true test of any product is, would you buy it after you try it?  In this case the wife says yes.  This is a good product, at least for her.</li>
    <li> I use other Olay products that I&#x27;m fairly happy with but this one didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  When I applied it, it just sat on top of my skin, and then would come off in little balls.  I have very dry skin and I do use a moisture surge first (Clinique) so I don&#x27;t know if that affected the use, but I have a whole bottle of this stuff that I can&#x27;t use.  I did like the dispenser.</li>
    <li> Has a &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; smell to it (I prefer the fragrance free version for this reason). But the product works well. Some women&#x27;s moisturizers are such heavy moisturizers that they cause me to break out. It&#x27;s been a while since I was prone to teenage breakouts, and I don&#x27;t want my moisturizer regressing me to that stage. This Olay product keeps my skin from drying out and from breaking out. Mostly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Olay Total Effects Moisturizer for years.  I have extremely fair &amp; sensitive skin that tends to be oily in some spots and dry in others.  I love this lotion because it has built in SPF, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and feels light when you put it on.  It absorbs relatively quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking oily, just healthy. I usually use it in the morning before applying my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it really fight seven signs of aging?  Maybe :)  Like I&#x27;ve said I&#x27;ve been using this for years and I like to think that my skin looks younger than my age, and when people ask how old I am they often think that I am about 10 years younger than I actually am.  So for me this is worth every penny, because while I am willing to use a good moisturizer to delay the signs of aging I am definitely not going to go the route of medical procedures to try to stay looking young, I just want to age gracefully (and as slow as possible, LOL) :)</li>
    <li> I normally use Loreal Revitalift as my daily moisturizer. This product falls short in several areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First it is greasy when it first goes on and feels tacky and heavy. That dissipates for the most part after it is absorbed but the Loreal is much lighter feeling. Second, perhaps because it is a heavier, greasier lotion but it does not sit as well under my foundation. (Covergirl Aquasmooth)It presents a less natural appearance and the makeup tends to cake on. Third, it only offers half the SPF, 15 compared to 30. I have very fair skin and am prone to freckling so the higher SPF is very important to me.  And finally, the smell is much too strong for a facial product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally did not see any benefit that it added over my current lotion and it had too many negative aspects for me to recommend it.</li>
    <li> The Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Moisturizer was a disappointment. I found the cream to be heavy and greasy, and didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin well at all. Additionally, the added sunscreen/SPF gave it that dreaded slippery texture and heavy feelingon the skin. It did little to mitigate seasonal dryness, and left my skin too shiny to properly apply makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a very good product, and did not meet my needs.</li>
    <li> I love Olay products. I use them all the time and think they are wonderful. So I tried this one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a change in my face. For one I thought the lines were not as sever, so that was good, but I also noticed that my forehead broke out. I didn&#x27;t have hives as other people did, but I did get pimples. There was no burning sensation or itching or anything like that. A few days later I broke out with six pimples on my forehead. I normally never get pimples; and I never had them as a teenager either.  When I stopped using the product they went away.  I do have sensitive skin, so I wonder if that had something to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product worked, but my skin broke out. I wonder if people with sensitive skin should not using this product.</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this moisturizer&#x27;s effect on my early-40s skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, applied every morning straight out of the shower, and I can&#x27;t believe the difference! My skin has become moist but not greasy, more elastic, the texture is something I thought I&#x27;d never see in my life, and the tone has evened out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be interested to see if it makes my skin too greasy in the summer, but right now, in the harshest time of winter, it has just been amazing.</li>
    <li> You generally can never go wrong with Olay products, and this is no exception. My wife&#x27;s been using it for a while now and really likes it. Her skin looks and feels great when this is applied. Not only does it moisturize, but the sunscreen protection is an added bonus. Whereas some products take a long time to be effective, you will feel the effects of this product within a few days. A huge benefit is that this one product substitutes for use of multiple products to get the same results. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife through Amazon Vine, and she was a bit confused when she started using it.  Is this an age-fighting cream?  A moisturizer?  A sunscreen?  All of the above?  The description touts, \\&quot;Fights 7 signs of aging--line and wrinkles, loss of firmness, visible pores, uneven tone, uneven skin texture, dryness, and dullness.\\&quot;  However, all 4 of the active ingredients are listed as sunscreen.  In addition, under \\&quot;Uses\\&quot; the box only says \\&quot;helps prevent sunburn\\&quot; and \\&quot;if used as directed with other sun protection measures, decreases the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging caused by the sun.\\&quot;  So according to the \\&quot;Active Ingredients\\&quot; and \\&quot;Uses,\\&quot; this is simply an SPF 15 sunscreen.  Therefore, is Oil of Olay making the claim, \\&quot;Use sunscreen over time and it will help fight the 7 signs of aging?\\&quot;  She feels this product is making false claims about age-fighting and thus duping consumers.  While this product smells fresh and goes on smooth, she expected the moisturizer to live up to the description, \\&quot;intense serum to fight 7 signs of aging\\&quot; which will result in \\&quot;visibly younger looking skin.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I had high expectations for this product because I liked another Olay face cream I tried, but I didn&#x27;t like this one nearly as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, either you want sunscreen in your face cream or you don&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t really want it (I don&#x27;t typically spend much time in the sun, so for me it&#x27;s unnecessary chemicals, and a LOT of them), but if you DO want sunscreen, wouldn&#x27;t you want more than a 15 SPF?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And since this cream does have sunscreen, it behaves like it.  It is slow to rub in; it wants to just kind of sit on your skin, and further rubbing creates putty-like white smudges on your face that bead up and get in your hair.  Well, that&#x27;s what it did to me, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, it did minimize my pores, and it worked okay as a moisturizer.  As a sunscreen, it wasn&#x27;t as greasy as a lot of them are, and it wasn&#x27;t irritating to my skin, so if I DID want some light sunscreen protection, this would be okay for that.  And this has the good broad-spectrum protectants you want in a sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of this product, I would recommend [[ASIN:B0000536P3 Olay Total Effects Moisturiser]], unless you REALLY want that 15 SPF.</li>
    <li> I love Olay products and at my age, I feel like I need them. This one feels silky smooth and doesn&#x27;t go on greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It claims to:&lt;br /&gt;Visibly reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;Hydrate for firmer skin appearance&lt;br /&gt;Instantly minimizes the appearance of pores&lt;br /&gt;Instantly balances skin tone&lt;br /&gt;Instantly smooths and evens out skin texture&lt;br /&gt;Provide nourishing moisturization&lt;br /&gt;Instantly gives skin a healthy radiance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it does a pretty good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it does have the sunscreen in it as well, but note, the instructions tell you to use water resistant sunscreen if swimming or sweating.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Has sunscreen, just one pump, that will be enough for face and neck. Really works.</li>
    <li> I love this for light makeup days</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is creamy, with a light scent, and goes on evenly.  It blends in well and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  A little goes a long way.  I love how this makes my skin feel.  I don&#x27;t know if it is working on the fine lines and toning, but I&#x27;m not sure how long it takes for it to start making a difference.  I love that it has sunscreen in it!  I am always looking for a nice moisturizer with sunscreen, however, I&#x27;m not sure how well the sunscreen works, as we haven&#x27;t seen sun in my town in months.  It doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and it leaves my skin smooth and moisturized.  I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This leaves my skin well moisturized but not greasy. It&#x27;s lightly scented, but not too obnoxious. I don&#x27;t know about all those seven effects... maybe if I didn&#x27;t take good care of my skin already I&#x27;d notice more of an improvement, but certainly this is as good and effective as any other high-quality facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is with the sunscreen. SPF 15, really? I know I&#x27;m, ah... pigmentally challenged... but I don&#x27;t expect to get a sunburn outside in the winter after a couple hours of exposure if I&#x27;ve got SPF 15 on. Yet, I did. So I would have to suggest using a real sunscreen along with this, if you need one.</li>
    <li> Moisturizer has one basic purpose; it makes your dry skin seem wet by helping to hold in moisture.  By making your skin seem wet, which is done with a combination of water and oils that somewhat mimic your skin&#x27;s natural oils and provide a barrier to escaping water, your skin should itch less in dry weather and should appear to be healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we all know, the skin that you see is already dead.  That skin has to be dead because it provides a barrier between the cold, cruel world and all the good stuff that is inside your skin, like, well, you, and all your soft body parts that have nerves that would not feel good if directly stimulated.  As several manufacturers have discovered, while your skin may be dead, it responds to certain chemicals in ways that we humans consider cosmetically beneficial.  Olay makes some of the best of these products and appears to have combined the benefits several of skin products with a combination lotion and sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay claims or brags that this moisturizing product does seven things all at once.  Here is this list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Lines and Wrinkles - Visibly reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;2. Loss of Firmness - Hydrates for firmer skin appearance.&lt;br /&gt;3. Visible Pores - Instantly minimizes the appearance of pores.&lt;br /&gt;4. Uneven Tone - Instantly balances skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;5. Uneven Skin Texture - Instantly makes your skin texture smoother and even out skin texture.&lt;br /&gt;6. Dryness - Provides nourishing moisture.&lt;br /&gt;7. Dull - Instantly gives skin a healthy radiance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always amused at marketing departments as they try to hype a product, and this product is no different.  I was also amused that Olay&#x27;s marketing uses one word, smoothes, which is not a real word.  I wonder if there are any English majors employed in their marketing department.  Incidentally, I replaced that word in my list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s dissect these marketing statements just a little bit.  This moisturizer is colored, and it is colored a sort of tan color that it functions as makeup.  If you have very light skin, you can see the moisturizer when you first apply it, but as you spread it out, the color evens out and eventually your skin looks \\&quot;natural.\\&quot;  The only problem is that if you have very light skin, like I do, by the time you spread the moisturizer to the point where it no longer looks like an alien parasite attacked your arm, then the claimed SPF 15 benefit is pretty much gone.  Oh, wait, the SPF 15 claim is not on their list of benefits in the 7 in 1.  I have to wonder why?  Is \\&quot;8 in 1\\&quot; not as catchy?  Perhaps Olay was concerned about people like me who spread the moisturizer to the point where the SPF 15 is closer to SPF 0.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say that the moisturizer balances skin tone, which means that you get a more uniform color of skin.  Of course, you can achieve the same effect using other products that are less expensive.  I am unable to say that my skin achieved a \\&quot;healthy radiance,\\&quot; but I suspect that the color and chemicals that provide the moisture also make your skin slightly shinier, so in appearance your unhealthy skin looks healthy, or a little bit healthier.  So we do see benefits #4 and #7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay also has a product, which I did not go out and look up, that supposedly reduces wrinkles and fine lines.  My recollection is that this product is relatively pricey.  It appears that Olay has incorporated those features in this product, which accounts for benefit #1 and it might have something to do with #3, since contracting skin, which reduced wrinkles and fine lines, would also decrease pore size.  I am walking on thin ground here because I am not 100% sure how this feature works.  I know I have heard of people using Preparation H to reduce wrinkles because I have heard it has a similar effect.  I do not recommend trying Preparation H on your wrinkles, I am just saying that is what I have read and seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this product is supposed to be a moisturizer, so it has some kind of oils in it somewhere to provide benefit #6, and these oils in combination with water and some other fun chemicals provides benefit #2.  Incidentally, a moisturizer has oils and other stuff that help hold water in your skin by providing a barrier to the water escaping.  Unfortunately, moisturizer can also block pores and can cause skin irritation for some people.  So the water in this product makes your skin \\&quot;wet\\&quot; or hydrated, and the moisturizer takes a stab at keeping the hydration in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only benefit I have not covered is #5, evening out skin texture.  Skin texture has two different aspects.  One aspect is what you see, which can be partially due to color differences and partially to dryness variations.  The other aspect to texture is what you feel.  The coloring part of this product helps even out the visible differences in color.  The moisturizing and hydrating parts of this product help address the variations you feel.  So, benefit #5 may not be a separate benefit, but a result of achieving the other benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor of this product is barely noticeable to me, though some people have described the odor as strong, powerful, and even overwhelming.  Different people have different levels of ability to smell an odor.  I could hardly smell this product, even when holding the product close to my nose, so I apparently am unable to smell the ingredient(s) causing issues with others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this product claims all sorts of benefits, and actually does seem to provide them, though the sunscreen part is not something I personally would write home about.  While having seven benefits in one product (eight if you count the SPF 15 sunscreen) may have a high convenience factor, I have to wonder whether it is worth the price.  After all, this product has 1.35 ounces; some ends up wasted because you can never get it all out of the bottle and some ends up in places where it becomes useless.  Because prices change, I will not mention the price here, but you do the math.  I can get a decent moisturizer with hydration in a local store for a fraction of the price per ounce of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We seem to place a high value on convenience, and Olay appears to be trying to capitalize on that value by throwing a bunch of stuff into one product.  Then they are charging you for the convenience.  Whether you are willing to pay that price for convenience is up to you.  You should also consider whether you are sensitive to the odor of the product and you may also wish to consider whether your skin is sensitive to this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!roduct is supposed to be a moisturizer, so it has some kind of oils in it somewhere to provide benefit #6, and these oils in combination with water and some other fun chemicals provides benefit #2.

After all, this product has 1.35 ounces; some ends up wasted because you can never get it all out of the bottle and some ends up in places where it becomes useless.  Because prices change, I will not mention the price here, but you do the math.  I can get a decent moisturizer with hydration in a local store for a fraction of the price per ounce of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We seem to place a high value on convenience, and Olay appears to be trying to capitalize on that value by throwing a bunch of stuff into one product.  Then they are charging you for the convenience.  Whether you are willing to pay that price for convenience is up to you.  You should also consider whether you are sensitive to the odor of the product and you may also wish to consider whether your skin is sensitive to this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> Olay Total Effects  7 in One Moisturizer is another excellent product from Olay. Unlike their regular moisturizers, this one has a much thicker consistency which glides on smoothly.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling like other lotions. The scent is very pleasant as well. This product also has a broad spectrum SPF for total sun protection. The women in our family have been using Olay products for three generations.</li>
