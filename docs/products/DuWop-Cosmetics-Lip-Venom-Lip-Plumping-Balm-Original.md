      <li>Venom does smell good though.</li>
      <li>This is a good moisturizer but won&#x27;t change the size of your lips.</li>
      <li>but my lips feel good when I put it on</li>
      <li>I loved this stuff for about a year, but now its all about the Buxom lip plumping line for me.</li>
      <li>and it does bring a good deal of color to my lips,</li>
      <li>It does taste good but that&#x27;s not a reason to spend all that money.</li>
      <li>It smells nice, isn&#x27;t too sticky, and is the perfect size to fit in any make up bag or purse.</li>
      <li>I had great expectations which have been met by another product I found in Spain but have not been able to trace it again.</li>
      <li>The gloss is nice and looks good, and the scent is nice too.</li>

      <li>i love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>I must say I LOVE this stuff!</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t even give me lips a nice shine.  </li>
      <li>lips are already nicely plump, not overly so, and</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own or over lip pencil color.</li>
      <li>Its a warm tingling feeling that works.</li>
      <li>Honestly, for the price, it&#x27;s not all they hype it up to be</li>
      <li>cinnamon flavor is nice but the plumper could be stronger.</li>
      <li>No tingling sensation nice scent.</li>
      <li>I tried it for a week and no results.. it does feel warm when you put it on your lips for about 15-20 minutes</li>
      <li>tingles and plumps lip nicely.</li>
      <li>However, it does have a very strong cinnamon smell.</li>
      <li>Very strong cinnamon taste</li>
      <li>The amount of cayenne pepper is very light.  </li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t going to give you sausage lips or anything, but it&#x27;s an okay product.  </li>
      <li>I think you should get more product..</li>
      <li>I have tried many lip plumpers</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>Interesting product to have on hand,</li>
      <li>If you want it to work better you can exfoliate your lips before putting it on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d love to find one</li>
      <li>I love this gloss</li>
      <li>Will be ordering more of this item soon.</li>
      <li>it was hilarious but he was humiliated as he&#x27;s a dude.</li>
      <li>It was always a thinner liquid, more like a lip gloss that stings, but I like the sting as I feel it is working.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have a plumping effect more than a stinging/burning with redness effect.</li>
      <li>For me this product has a lot more \\&quot;sting\\&quot; in it than most lip plumpers do</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hooked for life :) </li>
      <li>but I would recommend Sally Hansen&#x27;s clear lip plumping stuff just as much, it&#x27;s cheaper too!!- Happy Plumping!)</li>
      <li>I was excited to get this, it almost seems the &#x27;standard&#x27; of lip-plumpers, but I wasn&#x27;t that impressed.  </li>
      <li>Might be too strong for some people.</li>
      <li>One of the cool things I love is that I can apply it under or over any lip color if I am going to wear color and it doesnt alter the look I am going for.</li>
      <li>and it seems that people with already full lips get much more plumping.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping!</li>
      <li>With an addictive, spicy tingle, this magic goop leaves my lips soft, shiny and pouty perfect.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this product is worth the money, I got another one called luscious lips that works better and costs about $7.00 cheaper.</li>
      <li>Clear gloss has a good weight to it, works well on</li>
      <li>The best natural way to plump up your lips to look &amp;#34;bee stung&amp;#34; and full of natural color.  </li>
      <li>At first it was okay -</li>
      <li>Nothing special about this stuff.</li>
      <li>It certainly tingles and was one of the first of its kind.</li>
      <li>And with gloss, not bad.</li>
      <li>I absolutely loovvee my DuWop Lip Venom!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used in the past and always loved it!</li>
      <li>My brother put some lip venom on when i first bought it and just wanted to have him feel the nice tingle and his lips got so huge and red</li>
      <li>If anything it&#x27;s a little tingly but people claiming this lip gloss is like rubbing a fireball on your face need to grow a pair lol.</li>
      <li>I wish it will come in a bigger size cause its amazing.  </li>
      <li>the &amp;#34;stinging&amp;#34; is more like a warm tingle of cinnamon to me and it stops after a few minutes max.</li>
      <li>; However, the scent aside, it is definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t kiss anyone with sensitive skin with this on.:)</li>
      <li>In need of fresh gloss, i purchased it.</li>
      <li>so fun to have on.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>Some people&#x27;s lips are more sensitive to it.</li>
      <li>Bought it for fun none of this stuff ever works, i just like the tingle it has.</li>
      <li>Love the tingly feel and the look of lush lips.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like lipstick and this actually makes my lips feel better than chap stick.</li>
      <li>well I guess it makes a nice lip gloss until it&#x27;s used up, but I&#x27;d be careful before kissing anyone</li>
      <li>so I was able to wear it on a daily basis instead of just a once in awhile one.</li>
      <li>My favorite lip plumper, just wish they offered larger vile size.</li>
      <li>but this makes them really noticeable!</li>
      <li>Stings at first.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It depends on how often you put on lip-gloss but for the most part I only had to apply once</li>
      <li>You can get a better plumper from a drugstore brand for a third of the cost.</li>
      <li>The only positive thing I can say about this product is that the packaging is cute.</li>
      <li>taste is not bad, sting not bad, it will last about 20 min but does not plump.</li>
      <li>The price is also pretty reasonable.</li>
      <li>minor tingling, as opposed to most plumpers.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t notice much plumping and the bottle is very small, however, the gloss is so shiny and it has a great cinnamon-like flavor.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s glossy not sticky and gives your lips a plump lift enough for a noticeable difference and the color you get from the tinglyness is quite lovely and natural looking!  </li>
      <li>Kind of a little spicy ride for the lips.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I thought it would plump my lips, but it really didnt. It&#x27;s though I like to try new things always!</li>
    <li> Although it does smell great it&#x27;s simply nothing more than over priced clear lip gloss. There is a slight tingle but nothing more. You could get the same effect by putting toothpaste on your lips. I tried it several times and took photos each time and saw zero change. But if your looking for just simply a clear lip gloss there you go!</li>
    <li> Did not work at all for me. Maybe people&#x27;s physiology is different with this product but there was no tingling, burning, no change in circulation and no lip plumping or enhancement whatsoever. Such a waste of money -- and it is a teeny weeny container that could be used up in a week or so with daily use. It does taste good but that&#x27;s not a reason to spend all that money. This is a joke.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d read the other reviews and thought I&#x27;d still go forward and shell out the money to see for myself. Well I got nuthin&#x27;... nuthin&#x27; meaning results. Yeah it tingles, kinda like minty toothpaste when it&#x27;s on your lips so it&#x27;s not actually painful nor that unpleasant. And it tastes kinda, oh I don&#x27;t know \\&quot;cinnamon-y\\&quot;? I don&#x27;t notice any plumping action going on, or any coloration from any reaction or what-not. It&#x27;s also a much smaller bottle than I think I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe we&#x27;re programmed to expect miracles from some of these too-easy/good-to-be-true products and end up hoping they really work. The reality is most are just gimmicks and not worth the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well I guess it makes a nice lip gloss until it&#x27;s used up, but I&#x27;d be careful before kissing anyone, they might find it an unpleasant surprise.</li>
    <li> comes in a really tiny bottle, but a little will go a long way. minor tingling, as opposed to most plumpers. tastes like fireball. its my 3rd day in a row using it and my lips do look fuller and smoother</li>
    <li> Me being the silly optimist i am, i was looking for a real (at least noticable) plumping in my lips. This product when applied didnt really sting or tingle hardly at all. I was disappointed. The gloss is nice and looks good, and the scent is nice too. It just didnt give me the noticable difference i was looking for. If anything, it maybe made my lips slightly darker. I was also slightly suprised at how small an amount the bottle held. Honestly, for the price, it&#x27;s not all they hype it up to be and i don&#x27;t think i will be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> Product does nothing, slight tingle barely even noticeable. The bottle is tiny tiny tiny!! Does not plump lips... total rip off DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I spent about two weeks researching plumpers and ended up buying Lip Venom and Too Faced Lip Injection... both are CRAP! I feel like and idiot for wasting my money. Dont be fooled ladies!</li>
    <li> meh. no &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; besides the optical illusion caused by wearing a high gloss lip gloss. the &amp;#34;stinging&amp;#34; is more like a warm tingle of cinnamon to me and it stops after a few minutes max. its very pretty but very overpriced for essentially a TEEENSY bottle of shiny clear lip gloss (since there isnt any plumping action). I also didnt find it hydrating either - it was as hydrating as any regular lip gloss. for REAL hydration i like Eminence strawberry kiss lip gloss. All the glossy action PLUS lasting hydration.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used in the past and always loved it! Works great! Product came on time and just as described. You may feel a little tingle and burn but that&#x27;s all plumpers when you kiss someone they will feel it too i love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice much plumping and the bottle is very small, however, the gloss is so shiny and it has a great cinnamon-like flavor. It&#x27;s tingle feels fabulous, but only lasts about 3-4 minutes on the lips.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Ordered from Amazaon, as usual. I never received it and went to Post Office as it showed it was delivered, to whom I don&#x27;t know. This is not so much about the product, but how Amazon stands behind its consumers.  I had a credit within the week from them and will buy from them over and over again.  Much cheaper prices than you&#x27;ll find on e-bay as well. Check with Amazon before you buy, you&#x27;ll be glad you did if anything goes wrong. As for the Lip Venom, I use it and like it as a glosser, it stays on. Doesn&#x27;t poof your lips out like Angelina or anything, I just like the product. Too bad I didn&#x27;t get it, because it was the best price on the web.  Just think I have a screwed up post office, perhaps.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how much \\&quot;lip plumpers\\&quot; normally go for but this tiny, tiny bottle was 16 dollars and did absolutely nothing.  Didn&#x27;t even give me lips a nice shine.  Waste of money</li>
    <li> Very sticky. Didn&#x27;t notice a major difference but better than other lip plumpers I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> Read about the lip gloss in a book written by former madame. In need of fresh gloss, i purchased it. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as other lip glosses I&#x27;ve purchased off the shelf @ discount or drugstores. It&#x27;s a &#x27;plumper&#x27; as well, but i noticed when i used it over a deeper color, my color feathers into the thin wrinkles beneath and above my lips. Now i use it only with lighter, pinker colors, not deeper hues.</li>
    <li> Lip Venom and lip plumper from mica bella cosmetics are so far only lip plumpers i have found that actually plump the lips. Its a warm tingling feeling that works.</li>
    <li> This product is one of my must haves. I have small lips and don&#x27;t expect anything to actually plump my lips. I don&#x27;t like lipstick and this actually makes my lips feel better than chap stick. I like the tingle and it does bring a good deal of color to my lips, and of course it is the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; color. Some people really do plump up big. I&#x27;ve seen it do different things on different people. If you want it to work better you can exfoliate your lips before putting it on. I have let numerous friends try it and it seems that people with already full lips get much more plumping. Some people&#x27;s lips are more sensitive to it. Some people prefer the cayenne pepper formulas ie Too Faced Lip Injection which I dislike immensely because it makes me look like I just ate crawfish or something how the redness bleeds outside of my lip line and not in a \\&quot;sexy\\&quot; way. My brother put some lip venom on when i first bought it and just wanted to have him feel the nice tingle and his lips got so huge and red it was hilarious but he was humiliated as he&#x27;s a dude.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this trying to it at Sephora only to find it is no longer being carried there.  I must say I LOVE this stuff! I am a very pale person with naturally full lips but my lips are very pale. A lot of lipsticks and glosses cause my lips to dry out and then my lips look even worse.  This gloss works wonders for me. Within a few seconds of applying it my lips have color again! I love the sensation that comes along with it and the taste is not strong or overpowering either. I am definitely addicted to Duwop Lip Venom and have recommended it to my friends and they love it too! One of the cool things I love is that I can apply it under or over any lip color if I am going to wear color and it doesnt alter the look I am going for. This is a wonderful product. The only thing I dont like is the price for the amount you get. I will be buying this again in the future.. I definitely have no regrets with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Duwop Lip Venom uses essential oils stating that it ^Plumps^ by increasing circulation. I did feel a bit of \\&quot;sting\\&quot;, but I didn&#x27;t see any real plump. I&#x27;ve tried many plumpers, and they do make use of the oils to deliver a sting, and increase circulation, but I&#x27;m not sure they really plump. I&#x27;d love to find one that really does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste of DuWop isn&#x27;t bad - you get a lot of the cinnamon taste coming thru, which is okay in the DuWop, but you have to be careful with cinnamon oil because it can cause swelling of the throat - and that&#x27;s not exactly where I&#x27;m trying to plump! LOL&lt;br /&gt;DuWop isn&#x27;t one of those that makes the throat swell, thank goodness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is another thing. At first it was okay - it didn&#x27;t really bother me, but as time went on, as I used it day after day, the smell began to bother me. Smell is a really personal thing though! What bothers me might not bother someone else at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DuWop didn&#x27;t have a lot of staying power. But it&#x27;s a gloss - and glosses don&#x27;t usually have much staying power. They&#x27;re used for shine - so you reapply, reapply, reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased my DuWop for $16.00 - which I feel is a bit high for the little container, but it is considered a moderate end plumper - not a drug store product, but not a high end product either - like a quality lip stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars for staying power, smell, no visible plumping, and price.</li>
    <li> Ehhh...doesn&#x27;t seem to work like it used to when I would get it from a local Sephora.  Boo!!!</li>
    <li> On the up side it isn&#x27;t sticky and it does bring a tad more color to your lips but be warned: if you have any sensitive skin on or around your lips at all it will burn like crazy.</li>
    <li> This lip gloss is absolutely amazing! It&#x27;s smells delicious and doesn&#x27;t burn. If anything it&#x27;s a little tingly but people claiming this lip gloss is like rubbing a fireball on your face need to grow a pair lol. It&#x27;s glossy not sticky and gives your lips a plump lift enough for a noticeable difference and the color you get from the tinglyness is quite lovely and natural looking!  I&#x27;m hooked for life :) </li>
    <li> It is possible that this product is just not for me, but I wasn&#x27;t blown away by it.   I didn&#x27;t have a plumping effect more than a stinging/burning with redness effect. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so I was surprised.  Interesting product to have on hand, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Gives you a bee stung look. You only need a tiny bit because it can be a kind of sticky. Might be too strong for some people.</li>
    <li> This was the first plumper on the market and Du Wop is the expert when it comes to making a lip plumper gloss and they use essential oils and it is long lasting.</li>
    <li> The tingle sensation is fun, but I didn&#x27;t see any big change.  I loved this stuff for about a year, but now its all about the Buxom lip plumping line for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit sticky. It does plump through</li>
    <li> Did not do what was promised. For me it was a very expensive lip balm.</li>
    <li> Bought it for fun none of this stuff ever works, i just like the tingle it has.</li>
    <li> You can literally feel this plumper working. It smells nice, isn&#x27;t too sticky, and is the perfect size to fit in any make up bag or purse. It really, really works. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this, it almost seems the &#x27;standard&#x27; of lip-plumpers, but I wasn&#x27;t that impressed.  Especially for the size of it.  I&#x27;ve gotten other products that seem to have worked much better for me, such a &#x27;sexy mother plumper&#x27; and Victoria&#x27;s Secret&#x27;s plumper. It might work better for other people but the tingling doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long for me.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and I cannot use scented or colored soap on my face.  My lips have never had problems with lipstick, face paint, or other cosmetics before, so I decided to go ahead and try Lip Venom.  I was very nervous upon my first application, because I had read that the burning sensation was intensely painful for some people.  Well, I had little to worry about.  When I applied Lip Venom, I barely felt anything.  It took awhile for the tingling to kick in, and even then it burned only a little.  I am also extremely sensitive to spicy foods, and I cannot stand \\&quot;medium\\&quot; salsa, but the spiciness of Lip Venom was absolutely tolerable and felt rather sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lips are already nicely plump, not overly so, and all the Lip Venom did was redden them and make them shine.  Despite no increase in size (at least no noticeable increase), I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.  It is NOT painful, even if your pain tolerance is only at a two or three.  While it may not significantly plump your lips, it is nice to have a non-sticky lip gloss that brings out the natural color in you lips.  Also, it smells delicious.  If you have doubts about buying this product, forget them and go for it!</li>
    <li> Great product! Just be careful to keep the lid clean to prevent a poor seal and leakage.</li>
    <li> did not do what I expected.  Hardly noticeable.</li>
    <li> Really doesn&#x27;t plump them. Tastes like Cinnamon</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like it promises. It definitely tingles, but I don&#x27;t notice a different in lip color or size. I do like it but for $25 I wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Great Item very handy. Fits great in my purses too. Use it all the time. Dont leave home with out it. Recommend it to all. Thank you.</li>
    <li> As a lipgloss it does give the illusion of a fuller set of lips. For a short period of time of course. Not a long wear gloss. A little sticky. But overall not a bad plumper.</li>
    <li> Good gloss but WTH its so small! For the price you pay for it I think you should get more product..</li>
    <li> I have tried many lip plumpers and I think this one does work the best. The texture is great - it is thin and glossy and doesn&#x27;t become too sticky like Buxom. The price is also pretty reasonable. However, it does have a very strong cinnamon smell. When I was wearing it and my boyfriend was sitting next to me, he said &amp;#34;Oh, did you just eat a Clif bar?&amp;#34; However, the scent aside, it is definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> Wearing Lip Venom is a lot like eating something sumptuous. Nourishes my lips and ohhh so fun to have on.</li>
    <li> Great product and it taste very good.  I wish it will come in a bigger size cause its amazing.  Smiles</li>
    <li> I have tried EVERY and I mean EVERY lip plumper out there and this elixir of lip plumper is &amp;#34;Da Bomb&amp;#34; baby. With an addictive, spicy tingle, this magic goop leaves my lips soft, shiny and pouty perfect. My only complaint is the small size and extremely expensive price. DuWop is &amp;#34;UNFAIR TO LIPS,&amp;#34; because this Venom is SOOO addictive and so fabulous that after you get addictive, you will find yourself shelling out $80 a month because you will be terrified to run out of your Venom! I don&#x27;t use it any more, because I can&#x27;t afford it, but my friends and family are welcome to buy me Lip Venom for my birthday, Christmas and anniversary, PLEEEEEASE! Miss my &amp;#34;Venom!&amp;#34; Waaaaaaaaaaa!</li>
    <li> The best natural way to plump up your lips to look &amp;#34;bee stung&amp;#34; and full of natural color.  Expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! You can get a better plumper from a drugstore brand for a third of the cost.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past but not ordered from Amazon.  This tube that I rec&#x27;d is so thick that it is difficult to apply and uses so much each application that it will not last long.  It was always a thinner liquid, more like a lip gloss that stings, but I like the sting as I feel it is working.  Don&#x27;t know if I will order again as it was not the way I have rec&#x27;d it in the past</li>
    <li> taste is not bad, sting not bad, it will last about 20 min but does not plump.Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loovvee my DuWop Lip Venom!! It does exactly what it is supposed to do 😍 even though it is a little pricey, it is definitely worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Does not plump, but the formula warms the lips. It tastes kinda funky, to tell you the truth. Not worth the money to me. Be wary that it might be a trial size lipgloss, that&#x27;s the dinky size I got in a big pink cardboard tube.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, works okay.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on a how to video and wanted to try it.  I have to say, i didnt notice any &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; of my lips.  I tried it for a week and no results.. it does feel warm when you put it on your lips for about 15-20 minutes but that&#x27;s about it.  Very dissapointed, due to the price being somewhat higher than similar products I thought this was going to be a good buy.</li>
    <li> The only positive thing I can say about this product is that the packaging is cute. It didn&#x27;t plump my lips at all, it&#x27;s really sticky and shiny which is not my preference, and the amount of actual gloss in the tube is almost insulting. Complete waste of $18. DuWop makes a roller-ball lip venom which I had used in the past and really liked. It&#x27;s not sticky and actually made my lips look bigger. I recommend trying to find that one. DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is strange. Not worth the money. It does not do what it claims.&lt;br /&gt;But I like how it feels.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is worth the money, I got another one called luscious lips that works better and costs about $7.00 cheaper. Venom does smell good though.</li>
    <li> This definitely tingles your lips and gives u the feelings that it will plump but unfortunately it must not be made the same bc it doesn&#x27;t plump my lips much.</li>
    <li> Very strong cinnamon taste but I like that. tingles and plumps lip nicely.</li>
    <li> Stings at first.  Not sure what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Lips are very shiny and sticky.  Kind of a little spicy ride for the lips.</li>
    <li> I naturally have plump big lips but this makes them really noticeable! Don&#x27;t kiss anyone with sensitive skin with this on.:)</li>
    <li> For me this product has a lot more \\&quot;sting\\&quot; in it than most lip plumpers do and my lips took a longer time to build up an immunity to the product so I was able to wear it on a daily basis instead of just a once in awhile one. My only issue is that it really doesn&#x27;t do a whole lot to enhance any colors in my lips and the other colors offered in the line really aren&#x27;t my thing. Applying it over or under other lipsticks is a big no no to boot since it can eat through just about anything.</li>
    <li> Wanted MORE puff! But it does do a little, for the price, it&#x27;s OK. And with gloss, not bad.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Quick shipping!</li>
    <li> I like Oplump by smashbox better even though it&#x27;s more expensive. I have to keep the lip venom on my desk in a jar because it leaks if it&#x27;s not straight up and down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; cinnamon flavor is nice but the plumper could be stronger.</li>
    <li> I expected it to be a pencil stick sort as this appears to be but it came in a tiny bottle with a brush.</li>
    <li> Love the tingly feel and the look of lush lips. Tastes a little like cinnamon. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> The bottle is very small and it&#x27;s pretty sticky. I like the tingle, but wish it was a little stronger. Didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; my lips at all.</li>
    <li> It certainly tingles and was one of the first of its kind. It does work but results are short lived.</li>
    <li> Still the only one that works!  Nothing else compares! Love it!</li>
    <li> This had no effect at all and was not worth the purchase price. There was no problems with the vendor, just the product.</li>
    <li> it does not pout my lips as it promises. I had great expectations which have been met by another product I found in Spain but have not been able to trace it again.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot, it has a cinnamon feel/taste.&lt;br /&gt;It depends on how often you put on lip-gloss but for the most part I only had to apply once &amp; it lasted for hours.</li>
    <li> Use to buy this all the time in the store, but they don&#x27;t carry it anymore. I love this gloss it looks great on its own or over lip stick.very happy!</li>
    <li> This product had really great reviews on other websites and I&#x27;m not sure why. In no way did this product do anything other than make my lips glossy.</li>
    <li> It works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found it cheaper on eBay.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, tingles when it goes on, is small enough to keep in your pocket and I like the results. It&#x27;s a little pricy but my lips feel good when I put it on and I like the way they look. I don&#x27;t know if they plump my lips or not, but I like it all the same.</li>
    <li> Nothing special about this stuff.</li>
    <li> Only works  for like 10min</li>
    <li> My favorite lip plumper, just wish they offered larger vile size. I&#x27;ve recently purchased and tried several varieties of plumpers - this one really goes the job. Clear gloss has a good weight to it, works well on it&#x27;s own or over lip pencil color. Love it!</li>
    <li> Very thick, almost the consistency of honey.... And yes, it burns for a second, didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; a whole lot but I wasnt expecting to get the &amp;#34;just injected look&amp;#34; I think it&#x27;s a reasonable product for its price.</li>
    <li> This is a good moisturizer but won&#x27;t change the size of your lips. It tingles until it dries a bit and tastes like the old red hot cinnamon candies. Comes with a brush applicator and doesn&#x27;t take much to make your lips feel really gooey. It WILL leave a thick lip print on your glass or cup when you drink so a lot of it gets wasted and must be constantly reapplied. Won&#x27;t take up much space in your bag; the bottle inside the packaging is about the size of my pinky.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Tingles, plumps up lips (I wish it would do a little bit more.  Will be ordering more of this item soon.</li>
    <li> Great lip gloss as well as lip plumper.</li>
    <li> Gives you Angelina Jolie lips</li>
    <li> The amount of cayenne pepper is very light.  It does plump the lips a small amount but it does not last long.</li>
    <li> ... but it&#x27;s way over hyped.  This isn&#x27;t going to give you sausage lips or anything, but it&#x27;s an okay product.  (This might be a horrible thing to do but I would recommend Sally Hansen&#x27;s clear lip plumping stuff just as much, it&#x27;s cheaper too!!- Happy Plumping!)</li>
    <li> No tingling sensation nice scent. No flavor and would not buy this if you want bigger lips.  Also very small container</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this product measures up to other lip plumpers since it&#x27;s the first I have tried.... I do notice a small difference but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s also kind of expensive for such a tiny little bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff.  It makes my lips feel so good and the tingling sensation when I put it on is awesome 🙆.</li>
