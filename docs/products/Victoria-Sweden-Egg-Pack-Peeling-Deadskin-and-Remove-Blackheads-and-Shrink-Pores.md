    <li> I see nothing to write home about no more then to say that was some very pricey soap on my counter</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any &amp;#34;peeling&amp;#34; but the soap is strong without being irritating.  I have started to use it just on my oily areas, since I think it has, however, made the skin around my eyes tender.  It leaves you squeaky clean, that&#x27;s for certain!</li>
    <li> If you are over 50-60 do not use this daily.  Destroyed my forehead with dry patches and caused a flareup as well.</li>
    <li> This soap has done wonders to help my 16 year old granddaughter&#x27;s acne.  I have rosacea and tried it a couple days and it did not hurt my skin.  Its a great soap</li>
    <li> I have very weak and sensitive skin for every product especially cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleansed very smoothly and never irritating my problemic skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is awesome.</li>
    <li> This product is now part of my daily routine.  You lather it up and rub it on your face  Keep lathering until you can actually see it on your face.  Let it dry for about 4-5 min (while you&#x27;re prepping for your shower or bath) - then rinse really well.  I was totally surprised by the scent which is really nice and certainly gets you going in the right direction for the day.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> This soap feels wonderful and I believe it helps my complexion.  I will be ordering it again soon.</li>
    <li> This soap really does tighten the skin and makes it feel soft and clean. I am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a thorough but more delicate soap for post-menopausal skin.  This stuff is it--and you can use it like a mask, too.  Rinses away cleaner than anything, none of the harsh tingles from soaps like Noxzema I used when younger.</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely wonderful soap. My father bought it for me and it is really perfect for my skin (combination skin in a humid climate). I used it almost every night and it leaves my skin feeling soft and clean. Best to moisturize with a light cream afterwards if you have dry skin. A great buy!</li>
    <li> Awesome soap for any age of face. It cleared up blackheads and freshened my face. So awesome.. I will defiantly buy more. Came packaged well too. Thank you</li>
    <li> I used this soap many years ago and then forgot about it as it is hard to find.  I came across it again and ordered it right away. it is as wonderful as I remember it. leaves my skin with a lovely glow</li>
    <li> Lovely soap, a must for oily skin.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, mild facial soap. I use this exclusively at night as a first or second cleansing step. This soap contains no lanolin so it&#x27;s vegan/hippie safe!</li>
    <li> As I get older it gets difficult to find a perfect fit for my skin....still oily, wrinkles...etc.  This product has been wonderful to use, it last a long time and has actually been good for my skin!</li>
    <li> It is a bit dry on my skin after I used it to wash my face. I found it can&#x27;t remove sunscreen completely.&lt;br /&gt;It is lather well. But I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement on my open pores. maybe I need to use it for more longer time.</li>
    <li> this is the only face wash that doesnt seem to irritate my skin. however, it is a bit drying, so you may need a heavier moisturizer. i do feel like it refines pores. every once in a while my skin gets a little itchy if i leave it on too long, but i think thats just me, like if i already have a break out. it also makes my pores seem clearer.</li>
    <li> No miracles, but feels good, lathers well, and doesn&#x27;t upset my sensitive skin. Not the best for removing makeup, but would work well in the bath. You rub it in then leave it on for a few minutes. Great packaging, it&#x27;s in a very cute little box.</li>
    <li> The delivery was SUPER fast because the company is about a mile from where I live LOL. Had no idea until I saw the address on the package. I was tempted to purchase the 6 pack since the cost per bar is cheaper than the individual, but was worried it would break my skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the soap for less than a week and I like the way it leaves my skin feeling. I have caught myself looking in the mirror because my skin looks refreshed. I have oily skin so my face isn&#x27;t overly dry after washing. This is a VERY small soap compared to the likes of Dove, Aveeno, etc. It is about the size of the palm of my hand and I consider myself to have an average size hand. The smell is mild and pleasant. Not fond of the cost.</li>
