<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Unfortunately a straightening process done to my hair left it severely damaged.  My below the shoulder length blonde hair was actually breaking off! I was in such distress over it when a friend at work overheard me talking and recommended this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 weeks now and it has helped tremendously! I wash my hair only about twice a week now and usually use a cleansing conditioner (as shampoo really makes my hair crazy).  After towel drying my hair, I apply this product using a generous amount and comb it in with a wide tooth comb.  I leave it in for a while, depending how much time I have (at the very least 20 min., but sometimes an hour). I rinse it out really well and the end result is really lovely. I spend a lot of time at the gym and it is really hard not to wash my hair often with all the sweating.  I found what works in between washings is to just rinse my hair well and condition it, using this product. I can truly say this is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used.  My particular problem was very severe and this stuff did not disappoint and its probably one of the reasons I am not completely bald!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this twice and I really like it! I have natural kinky curly hsir and this makes it so smooth and soft!</li>
    <li> I used this after using my Ultra Black Hair conditioner. Made my hair feel like silk. Did not weigh it down.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for a lower price on another website after using the garlic conditioner from alter ego, which I love.  I began using protein treatments for my damaged hair and wanted a deep moisture only conditioner....enter this product!  Super large container, smells great and leaves my hair shiny and bouncy! Wonderful!!!!</li>
    <li> Good experience.  Leaves hair soft.</li>
    <li> I really like this product!</li>
    <li> Instant softness after just one use, but no difference with detangling. The smell is pleasant but not really much of a coconut smell. The jar is huge, I&#x27;m sure will get many uses in order to see and feel results.</li>
    <li> Tried this on freshly shampooed hair. Used an ample supply and sat with a plastic cap under the dryer for about 20 minutes. Rinsed out with lukewarm water and finished with a cold rinse to closed the cuticles. Blow dried and was amazed at the sine and softness. Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> One of he best hair products that I have ever purchased!!!! Totally Amazing.....Since I periodically color my hair, it can get dry and dull. But no matter how dry &amp; brittle my hair may get, once I use Alter Ego, my hair is soft and silky.It even has a shine to it . I always keep this product in my house....Totally LOVE tis product.</li>
    <li> Used it before.&lt;br /&gt;works great.&lt;br /&gt;would continue using it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;good for all types of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;must try</li>
    <li> Best conditioner for natural hair. Very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product 2 times already and I must say that it smells wonderful and leave my hair untangled, light and moisturized. They ship to APO AE locations but my only complaint is the cost but which means i have to use it carefully.</li>
    <li> Thanks i like this product</li>
    <li> My hair loves this conditioner. Best results after sitting under a dryer.  Don&#x27;t worry, the coconut scent is very faint.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner, a beautician used it on my hair in New York and I just had to order it. My hair is soft and luxurious and the conditioner was perfectly packaged.</li>
    <li> Amazing results! Even after the first use my hair was softer, shinier, and less damaged. Will be buying more products from Alter Ego.</li>
    <li> I use this as a leave-in conditioner.  A small amount rubbed into hands  and through the hair.  Comb it thorough and no freezies</li>
    <li> I love it. It makes my hair very soft and its detangling too. Nice smell.</li>
    <li> It took about two months before I noticed less hair loss but I do believe this product works along with a hair vitamin.</li>
    <li> In Colombia, this bottle cost at least 60 dollars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks! I bought 3 bottles, my daughter and my wife uses it. It really, really works!</li>
    <li> Perfect deep conditioner for my hair. My hair is down to my lower back and it&#x27;s often difficult to keep root to ends equally moisturized. I&#x27;ve used this twice and didn&#x27;t need to touch my hair for almost two months in between treatments (meaning, I did not wash or condition my hair for two months. This is my norm. It&#x27;s what works for my hair). It&#x27;s a staple. Will never be without it.</li>
    <li> This by far is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve tried. I am a product junkie and will try anything once. I am in the process of transitioning from relaxed to natural and have not had a perm in a year. This conditioner has made my hair soft and manageable.  I use it for co-wash, deep condition and even a small amount as a leave in.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate try it you won&#x27;t regret it and your hair will love it.  I&#x27;ve grown 3 inches in and retained it using this conditioner.</li>
    <li> i like this conditioner i just use a little i makes my hair soft and builds up my hair no breakage here it also smells so good also came faster than expected i would purchase from seller again</li>
    <li> Great product, smells nice and hair feels smooth and soft!</li>
    <li> Very Very Good. Leave the hair shining and manegeable. Restore sit ends and damage hair. Definetly i recomend it. Also help with tinted hair.</li>
    <li> Made my hair very soft and smell great! Had to sit under the dryer with it to get the best effects.</li>
    <li> It smells really nice and leaves my hair very soft. I&#x27;m African American with relaxed hair I  the middle of my back. I usually use Nexxus but decided to switch for a while.  The jar is huge</li>
    <li> i love this product i have very dry damaged hair and and this product definitely helps, i tried using it every week after ive treated my hair,to give it back moisture.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried this it was a gift.  I received this one when expected.  It was very well packaged and protected.</li>
    <li> Quick Background: I&#x27;m an African-American woman with relaxed hair.  I go to the Dominican salon once per week and use Organix Shea Butter and Argan Oil Shampoo and Condition and Alter Ego Nequal Intensive Energizing Lotion as a leave in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes my hair SO soft and manageable.  It smells like coconut and the jar is huge.  My ends look noticeably better, my hair feels really good, and I use less moisturizer because of how moisturized my hair is after using this product.  I would highly recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Best hair conditioning product ever!</li>
    <li> the best conditioner I have ever used will recommend it to everyone use and hair is silky and soft more manageable.</li>
    <li> Not only does this smell nice it has made my hair extremely soft. I have no split ends. even when i wash my hair myself and use it my hair has such bounce and flows. I love love love this and will purchased a second bottle once the one I have is done.</li>
    <li> Love the easy comb-thru-- this product also works well restoring moisture after swimming in chlorine and salt water. Check out Thehairgirl.com for healthy relaxed hair!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. WORTH EVERY PENNY! This will make your hair feel like silk.I was my hair, leave this on for 30 mins under a dryer, put in my rollers..when the rollers come out my hair feels like silk. My hair is very damaged so this is a miracle for me. Buy it. You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> My favorite hair conditioner ever!</li>
    <li> Love it! Good for ALL types of hair!</li>
    <li> Love this product... It keeps my hair soft and easy to manage... I wish these products were readily available in the US.</li>
    <li> The product itself is a little thinner than I expected.  My normal conditioner is actually more of a paste than this product.  That being said, I&#x27;ve been using it once a week and it does leave my hair moisturized.  I&#x27;d use it more often, but I don&#x27;t have time during the week to really leave it on to soak in.  I have a LOT of VERY long fine hair that has been battered by sun, salt, and sand for the last 3 years.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this for anyone looking to revive dry hair.  The coconut smell transfers pretty nicely to my hair too.  I&#x27;m always disappointed when I use a coconut product and don&#x27;t get that awesome coconut smell.  I forgot to measure the container, but I will mention that this is a pretty generous amount of product.</li>
    <li> Very good product lov it , it&#x27;s magical how your hair looks after using mansechera , I really recommend this fabulous product</li>
    <li> leaves the hair soft and smelling good. I coat my hair in it, put on a plastic cap, and sit under the hairdryer for 30 min to an hour to deep condition. Works great.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Great delivery</li>
    <li> After shampoo, I use this conditioner and leaves my hair very soft and manageable. Great results! I recommend it, specially for people who relax their hair.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to write a fair review.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to use it with my hair steamer...&lt;br /&gt;I will be sure to come back n review properly in due time.</li>
    <li> em.. I don&#x27;t see any difference.. :(</li>
    <li> Completely hydrates natural hair. A must have</li>
    <li> Ok but not the greatest. Smells good</li>
    <li> This Mask is amazing, as well as most products from Alte Ego on my opinion. again works wonders on straighten hair like mine :)</li>
    <li> Great price for great product</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It quenches my thirsty hair&#x27;s thirst. It is a great deep conditioner.  Why pay for a deep conditioner at the salon when you can do it yourself? Also the price is great!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is wonderful , my hair feels like silk after using it&#x27;s , a great moisturizer , smells so good , I will repurchase this conditioner again without a doubt.</li>
    <li> Smells absolutely wonderful! Leaves my hair super soft.</li>
    <li> This is my first time purchasing and using this product. I am very happy with the results. My hair is soft, like really soft and no breakage. Even my hair stylist noticed the change, especially when I was getting roller set. My hair is light and full of body. I am hooked. Definitely worth the money.</li>
