<li> This product was delivered on expected delivery date.</li>
<li> Only complaint is that I got two necklaces, two pendants and chains, but only one had that weird clip that you need for these ball chains and I had to take another one from a different necklace.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not a light little plastic necklace....</li>
<li> It feels heavy in your hand, but not on your neck.</li>
<li> I think the pendant is just a little to small and the it comes with two pendants but one chain.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a prefect small pendant that neither man nor women would be embarrassed to wear.</li>
<li> the one negative is it didn&#x27;t come with two chains :-(</li>
