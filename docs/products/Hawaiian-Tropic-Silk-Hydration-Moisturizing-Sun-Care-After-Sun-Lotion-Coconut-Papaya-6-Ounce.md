<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used other after tanning lotions before, but I was so impressed with the light touch that this product leaves. It was moisturizer  that refreshed my dry skin as well. The delivery was prompt as well. I will be ordering this again</li>
    <li> Great product, smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Great smell and works!</li>
    <li> Immediately takes out the burn sting, smells great (sweet and fruity like a tropical vacation) and is easily absorbed and non-sticky.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!</li>
    <li> I have fair skin so when I burn I need intense lotion.  This lotion I bought at the beach and I loved it, couldn&#x27;t find it local once I got home so I came to trusty Amazon!  Leaves skin feeling silky soft, smells great, and with the aloe in it helps heal sunburns</li>
    <li> This is a great after swim, sun and bath lotion.  My only problem is that if I wear it before a massage, it balls up like rubber when mixed with the oils.  Other than that, pleasant scent and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> works great, not greasy.  Light fragrance not over powering.</li>
    <li> The moisturizer is awesome and the fragrance is wonderful, not to strong of femine. Great for both guys and ladies.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, ready helps sunburn heal exponentially quicker</li>
    <li> I love this product!! For one, it smells amazing ( which is a must for me) lol. Secondly, it didn&#x27;t leave residue on my skin which is also important to me. I am ready for my vacation now.</li>
    <li> smells super good, and leaves skin super soft!</li>
    <li> This stuff is very nice smelling and goes on easily. It does have a very slight stickiness to it, not quite as smooth as a straight lotion product, but with the aloe swirled in, it is to be expected. I used this following a 3 day fishing trip in the sun just to ensure my skin stayed moist and happy. Have not applied this to a burn yet to see how it performs, hopefully I never will have to!</li>
    <li> This stuff saved me on my honeymoon from sun burns!  does a great job hydrating the skin and has a fantastic smell</li>
    <li> This product lives up to it&#x27;s name.  It hydrates your skin to a silky soft texture even smoother than it was before you went out into the sun.  I highly recommed it for all  your after Sun activities.  You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Smells nice,but poor moisturizer</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It smells like summer and moisturizes skin without a greasy feel on your skin. Great for after the beach.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Product is as described.</li>
    <li> I cannot brag enough about this product. Any time I have a sunburn from mild to moderate, I use this product. Very soothing.</li>
    <li> This stuff goes a long way with just a small amount. It keep my skin from drying out and pealing after a long motorcycle ride. It smells good also.</li>
    <li> Great product I must say. Leaves skin feeling hydrated, moisturized, and fresh. It smells really good as well.</li>
    <li> Works well, a bit tacky after application and smells a bit feminine. Prefer the neutrogena after sun over this one.</li>
    <li> I got a trial size for free with a VoxBox a while ago. My skin is very fair, and I&#x27;m outside all day with kids (I work at a daycare), so I burn a lot. This stuff not only smells good, but it IMMEDIATELY soothes the burning and stinging. HIGHLY recommended. I&#x27;ll never use anything else!</li>
    <li> I love Hawaiian tropic brand sunscreen and lotions. Ordered this in February for my honeymoon- as most stores where I live didn&#x27;t have much of a sunscreen selection. unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t delivered in time for my trip. However, it was delivered eventually and I will use it this summer!</li>
    <li> My nine-year-old daughter actually requested that I go online and give this product a good review.  First, the product smells amazing.  It goes on smoothly, does not feel overly greasy, and is absorbed quickly.  On our last day in Hawaii, my daughter&#x27;s legs were a bit burnt and dry from a week&#x27;s vacation in the sun and water.  We were shopping and I mistakenly put a sample of lotion from the store (not this product) on her legs to make her feel better.  Her legs began stinging and she was in pain and near tears during the walk back to the hotel.  I felt terrible!  When we got back to the hotel, I remembered that I had packed this product- just in case.  I whipped it out of the suitcase and put it on her.  INSTANT relief!  If you could see the expression of pain on her face before this went on, and the sigh of relief that happened afterwards, you would be sold.  I loved this product before because of the smell, but now after seeing its power in action, I am a committed customer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s silky and smooth. Nice after a hot day in the sun.</li>
    <li> I tried this out on my arm today, even though it is for a trip.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on like silk and I know it will keep my skin moisturized,&lt;br /&gt;while in Jamaica.&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff, and it came on time and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Works well, not greasy, and absorbs quickly into the skin.  Used it after sun at Galveston Beach, and cooled the skin, plus we didn&#x27;t get burned!</li>
    <li> Just as with the protective lotion: the smell is amazing! I love Hawaiian Tropic, I must say; it keeps my skin perfect after some hours under the sun; and because it has aloe vera I have also use it after getting my lex wax: I assure you, great results</li>
    <li> I received a sample size from INflenster and I love love LOVE it! it smells great and feels great on my skin after I just spent time in the sun. I defiantly will be using this a lot more!</li>
    <li> When I received the smaller size for testing for Influenster, I immediately tried it after I smelled it - such a light and good smell! This is probably the best feeling lotion I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t leave a thick feeling on your skin and is very cool and soothing. I&#x27;d probably use it every time I got out of the shower!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this for testing purposes through Influenster. The smell is absolutely delicious. This helped soothe my very fair skin after my shoulders burned. They did not peel after using this as they would if I didn&#x27;t apply anything on the burn.</li>
    <li> Really nice scent and gives a nice relief so it works well, no need to apply over and over again.</li>
    <li> So soothing after a long day in the sun. Smells really yummy, too! I will definitely buy this again and again!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this and loved it so much I had to have more!  It smells like summer first of all!  I absolutely love the scent.  The lotion is thick and it immediately cools the skin when applied.  It left my skin feeling smoother than it has felt in forever.  We go swimming at the pubic pool a lot which is highly chlorinated so my skin was getting very dry and flakey and irritated when I shaved.  This lotion saved me!</li>
    <li> I received a tester from Influenster to test this product out. It just so happened that I had spent all day in the pool! It is great. It smells good and really hydrated my skin. I will purchase this in the future.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it helps keep tan when I buy it. Not too bad for me, but won&#x27;t buy it again. I also bought the Hawaiian Tropic Cool Aloe After Sun Burn I.C.E. Gel, which works better for my situation. Smells like summer and I like it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s funny how I got burnt the same day my free sample (complimentary of influenster.com) came in the mail. It really does sooth your skin of burning. I never would have tried this product if it wasn&#x27;t sent in my Voxbox</li>
    <li> I was looking at a couple of different aftersun/burn lotions like cocoa butter products, sun bum, etc. I used this and sun bum and they both smell so amazing. This one is more of a gel - aloe feel, whereas sun bum is like an actual lotion. I have both because sometimes I want a different type of lotion. I use this to keep my tan longer. If I burn, I use this a ton to prevent peeling. Remember to exfoliate before you start peeling to keep the tan longer!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells AMAZING &amp; is exactly what I was looking for - use it every time I spend a few hours in the sun and no more dry skin :)</li>
    <li> It worked great with soothing and cooling mine and my daughter skin after a long day in the sun!  I would buy this again and recommend it</li>
    <li> When I put this on I actually saw the ribbons in the gel- which was cool! It feels like what it is, a cross between aloe gel and lotion. It dried smooth, not sticky. The fragrance itself is hard to put my finger on. It&#x27;s light, not overwhelmingly fruity. If I hadn&#x27;t known better I might not have picked up on the coconut scent at all. I actually really like it. This one will be staying in my beach bag from now on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received this product from Influenster for testing purposes. All opinions are my own.)</li>
    <li> Did not smell as good as I thought when I first smelled the product and it is a little greasy but it does hydrate your skin</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaves your skin hydrated and silky smooth! Hard to find in stores, so i purchased online.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product. It rubbed right on my skin it was smooth and soft and silky. It also has a great smell. I tend to have itchiness and redness if I am in the sun for too long and it relieved both the redness and the itchiness away.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! I got it courtesy of Influenster to try and I absolutely love it! I will be repurchasing it in the future!</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this. It is almost like a gel. It smells great and helped keep my skin tan and soft  after a day in the ocean while on our cruise.</li>
    <li> First off, the smell is so good, I&#x27;ve gotten tons of complements on how good it smells!  Second, it rubs in really well without a greasy residue unlike many other products that tried in the past.  Overall, it&#x27;s a great product for the price and I will continue to purchase for my after sun skin ritual.</li>
    <li> I received this product free for testing purposes from Influenster.  After a day in the sun, I hadn&#x27;t reapplied my sunscreen so got a little sun burn.  Used this product and it soothed my skin right away.  Will be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> I recently tried this product for the first time, when it was sent to me in the surfsupvoxbox via Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Hawaiian Topic products because they always smell just like a tropical paradise, and remind me of my favorite vacations from the past. This after sun lotion is hydrating, and has made my skin feel great. After a day in the sun, my forehead and nose were a bit sunburned-I used the silk hydration after sun lotion, and it made my skin feel silky, soft, and re-hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smells amazing and leaves my skin feeling wonderful! I will definitely be using it before and after being in the sun!</li>
    <li> love this! Smells great and really soothes skin after being in the sun.</li>
    <li> This after sun lotion worked wonders after hours on the beach and a pretty bad sun burn. It worked well to moisturize the skin and relieve the pain. The only other thing I could have asked for was if it prevented all of the peeling that followed.</li>
    <li> Overall, good product.  But the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.  I still like it though.</li>
    <li> I worked outside in NY, she had a week at the beach in Maine, but in the end, both me and my girlfriend looked like lobsters. Aloe was good in the short-term, but she asked that I order the Hawaiian Tropic lotion -- and I&#x27;m glad we did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, the sunburn just healed faster and hurt less. Aloe is messy and sticky, but this has a nice, thick consistency that rubs in well. It smells nice, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s best to avoid a burn in the first place, but I&#x27;m happy knowing that we&#x27;ve got a product that will soothe and heal if we get too much sun. It&#x27;s worth paying more for this than for cheaper aloe because it just plain works better.</li>
    <li> Saturday received, waiting for is always so long. Amazon&#x27;s service is very thoughtful, have email reminder.&lt;br /&gt;Taste fresh, the summer after the trouble will not burn.</li>
    <li> I take this to our cabin for the people who forget sunscreen.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I received this product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes! I absolutely love this product!! I used it one day after I was out in the sun all day and I got a sunburn and I used this product and I didn&#x27;t peel at all like I normally do! I would use this product again! It feels so go going on and makes your skin feel so soft! It smells good as well!</li>
    <li> I was happy to receive my  prompt order! After my sunbath I applied Hawaiian Tropic Silk Hydration. It left my skin cool, light, and airy. Soft, Without a sticky feeling. I didn&#x27;t sweat out the lotion,as I normally would immediately after applying skincare products. I was really happy and impressed about that!&lt;br /&gt;The sweet aroma and bright pretty colors of the lotion, is very inviting. After using it I feel like I have a little piece of Hawaii with me :)  Thanx Hawaiin Tropic</li>
    <li> As someone who burns easily I found this lotion a great help!  I apply it after being out in the sun and avoided dry spots and it kept areas that got a bit burned hydrated and soothed.  I generally don&#x27;t like aloe creams because they can feel greasy or thick but this went on light and kept my skin from getting worse! I&#x27;d buy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Hawaiian Tropic Silk Hydration After Sun Lotion in my Influenster #SurfsUpVoxBox</li>
    <li> we took this on our cruise this srping and it worked well no pealing and soothed those red tan lines nicely</li>
    <li> This has such a nice smell and it is thick. I use both after sunbathing and after tanning in the tanning bed (gets rid of after tan odor).</li>
    <li> This stuff really is a 5 star product.  I find it makes my skin silkier than regular lotion and the scent is terrific. If you are using this for after sun it works better than the green gel stuff.  I recently burned on a beach vacation and kept putting this on every time I felt warm which was often. I never peeled. I like it so much I signed up for subscribe and save and use it as a daily moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Have used it during my last vacation to the Dominican Republic.  I have gotten seriously burned and although my skin is now peeling I feel like it would have been much, much worse had I not used this after sun lotion.  It provides superb hydration and has a very nice and light scent.  Would def. buy again!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It makes my skin feel very hydrated after being in the sun .I highly recommend this to anyone that spends time in the sun, whether working in it or playing in it.</li>
    <li> This lotion is excellent! It smells yummy but isn&#x27;t overbearing, it&#x27;s moisturizing, and prevents peeling. But, best of all, it absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t sticky!! I love it.</li>
    <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing and it was one of the best after sun items I have ever tried! It smells great, isn&#x27;t too sticky like a lot of after sun products can be and it left my skin feeling so lovely! I will be purchasing again for sure!</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this product.  It feels so amazing on my skin after a day at the beach and it smells wonderful!!</li>
    <li> I was burnt after 4 hours walking under the sunshine and skin kept peeling off my face, really hurts. Then I bought this product and put a decent layer on and left for a while, like a mask, such a big relief! It soothed my face and brought a cool minty feeling too. Face stopped peeling the next morning, got back to smooth. The dual effect of aloe gel and moisturizer really works well!</li>
    <li> The best after sun lotion I have ever used! It smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> Great after sun product. I used on my face because it was non greasy and put the moisture back after laying in the sun. I live in NY, I am in my mid fifties with fair to medium skin and went on a cruise in October. I am not a sun person so was concerned about my skin especially my face. I used Hawaiian tropics hydration tanning lotion on my face and this afterwards. Helps heal the sun exposed skin and maintains the tan longer.  I continued to use for a period of time after the cruise to keep my tan a little bit longer.it keeps the skin from flaking. Have used Hawaiian tropic products since I a teen and would not use any other brand.</li>
    <li> I love this after sun skincare. I have always used normal aloe vera but a friend introduced this to me when I got a horrible sunburn. First, let me just say I wanted to sniff my skin all day! It smells soooo good. Also, it really made my burn this painful. I put this on and the next day most of the burn was gone.</li>
    <li> Nice.  Smooth.  Very smooth.</li>
    <li> This make my skin so buttery smoov and the smell just brings in the ladies</li>
    <li> Living in Florida makes sunburns more than a rare occurrence so aloe vera is essential to alleviate the soreness from burns. This lotion works really great. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different aloe veras for sunburns and this one works just as good as any other. The lotion applies smoothly and doesn&#x27;t spread too thick. The best part is that it is not sticky and goopy like aloe vera gels. I also really like the smell of it (something I didn&#x27;t expect). The scent smells good without coming off as too potent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really liked this lotion and plan on using it for all my sun burns and irritations. I recommend it if you are a frequent tanner or just somebody who spends a lot of time in the sun.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I am a very sun sensitive red head and recently took a trip to Jamaica. I used this product every day after sun bathing and it was my life line! With the cooling aloe and 24 hour moisture; I never needed any other lotion to keep my skin feeling hydrated and there was no sticky residue. It smells INCREDIBLE! Everyone should have this product in their beach bag!</li>
    <li> i use this on a regular basis. i do not have dry skin when i use this product. will order more in the future.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to those icky sticky aloe vera gels after a bit too much sun. This stuff rubs in and feels silky, not greasy or sticky, and it smells amazing. It seems to provide the moisture needed to keep your skin soft and your tan even and pretty.</li>
    <li> Hoping it was a decent substitute for the old yellow HT After Sun i loved years ago. It&#x27;s not. The scent is over the top sweet and the cream sits on top of your skin rather than nourishes it. Oh well!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, glides on effortlessly, sinks into skin quickly. I can&#x27;t speak for it soothing sunburn, because I&#x27;m very careful not to burn, but this is such a great summer moisturizer. I use it after I bathe or when my skin just needs a little moisture. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times someone has told me, &amp;#34;You smell just like summer!&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m wearing this. I will definitely repurchase when I run out! Which will probably be a while, because even though it&#x27;s a pretty small bottle, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for and at a great price!</li>
    <li> I received a trial size complementary from voxbox and I must say I love it!! Wast sure about it at first because I normally just use aloe but this stuff works fast and has a nice smell. Makes you want to go somewhere tropical!</li>
    <li> The smell of this is amazing.  The way it makes your skin feel is wonderful.  I even use this when I am not out in the sun.  It works great at any time.  I love love love love loveee it!!!</li>
    <li> cream pleasant to use! stunning light tropical flavor, weightless texture, literally melts into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;perfectly absorbed and moisturizes, no sticky residue, no feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;just wonderful! no doubt, take it! you will love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Not only does my skin feel better but I smell like island paradise! I always like to use after sun lotion when I get done at the beach for the day. Hawaiian Tropic products are not tested on animals and always go further than I imagined a small bottle would. The travel size that I received from influenster for reviewing purposes lasted throughout my week long beach and will probably last through my next trip!</li>
    <li> Great after sun product!</li>
    <li> The best after sun!! It totally rubs in and keeps your legs looking silky smooth and hydrated! I love to use this after a shower after a day at the beach. It also smells AMAZING!!!! I love all Hawaiian Tropics sun care products but this one is my favorite!!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this lotion after reading great reviews regarding it&#x27;s sunburn relief qualities. I was trying to decide between the Banana boat version and this one at Target. I used this one 2 times per day (morning and evening) in place of my normal Cetaphil lotion (which I only use once per day and my skin is silky smooth) following my first summer sunburn. Growing up in California, I&#x27;m not stranger to sunburns. Peeling is inevitable after a sunburn, but the reviews showed promise that I may not peel if I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every evening and morning in bed I couldn&#x27;t figure out why I was so sticky. I attributed it to the hot weather (even though the a/c was running continuously), until after a few days I realized it was because of this lotion. The smell was nice at first, but after 2 days it became nauseating. My wife wouldn&#x27;t hug me anymore it was so bad... and I shower 1-2 times per day, just because I like to stay fresh, and it just instantly made me gross until my next shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On day 4, I began peeling. Now day 6 and I&#x27;m still peeling. So it didn&#x27;t prevent the peeling at all, like I had naively believed it might. I peeled the same amount as I always have in the past, and the same amount as my family who got the same amount of sunburn as I did. So if you count them as a control group, there was no benefit to using the lotion over those who didn&#x27;t. And I was sticky, gross and smelly the whole time for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its one redeeming quality was a perceived slight relief upon application when the sunburn was still hurting. So for that purpose it may be slightly beneficial; just don&#x27;t expect it to prevent any peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched back to my Cetaphil, and my skin is once again soft, moisturized, and non-sticky.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I had 4 people in my family with all kinds of skin types including a hair head with very fair skin.  Everyone loved how it last for a long time and the sun burn was gone in 3-4 days.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work as well as other aloe products I&#x27;ve used before.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I used this after I got a little bit of sun while white water rafting. It is a great alternative to sticky Aloe Vera gel. It rubs in nicely like a lotion, feels silky, and not greasy or sticky. I really liked how my skin felt moisturized and kept my skin soft and my tan even. I also love the smell. My 8 year old niece wanted to put some on just because it smelled so good.</li>
    <li> I received my free sample of Hawaiian Tropic Silk Hydration After Sun Lotion in my Influenster #SurfsUpVoxBox and used it after I got a bad sunburn from a cloudy day at the pool.  I loved the scent and how it seemed to make my skin feel hydrated without feeling greasy.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sticky and smells like a child&#x27;s cheap chapstick. You&#x27;re better off with regular lotion than this.</li>
    <li> It smells good, it&#x27;s light/not greasy, and it works...there isn&#x27;t much else to say about it!</li>
    <li> I live at the beach and keep stocked up on this lotion. My skin loves it. On the rare occasion that I get burned or over do it in the sun, this is the answer to my prayers. Cools but isn&#x27;t dramatic or tingly just smooth and soothing. I used to use aloe gel, but this mix of gel and lotion is the perfect combination.</li>
    <li> bought this for our Feb. trip to Florida... and just as I thought we all got burned really bad..my family was fighting over this stuff.. it relives to pain of the burn ALOT. its makes it bareable.. I dont think there is any thing that will take out the pain for ever but this help us get through the night enough to go back to the beach the next day.. we all still peeled but that was minimal.. I would buy this again.. only down side.. was appling it when you are burn hurt wish this formula came in a spray...</li>
    <li> I love this after sun lotion. It smells like summer and moisturizes the skin very well. Great for after a long beach day. Immediately takes out the burn sting and is easily absorbed and non-sticky.</li>
    <li> What a fabulous product.  It smells wonderful and makes my skin soft as butter.  I have put it in my subscribe and save program.  The best is the shimmer which is hard to find. BUT I won&#x27;t give it 5 stars because the packaging is so dopey.  It takes the strength of Hercules to squeeze it out of the bottle, the plastic is so hard. What were they thinking anyway? I will buy it anyway</li>
    <li> This is my favorite after sun lotion. No oily residue, smells great, and keeps you glowing and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Love the smell! Fresh but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the texture. Soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works very well. I didn&#x27;t get sunscreen on a small section my leg and this worked very well.</li>
    <li> Smells great and is a great moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I received this from Influenster in the Surf&#x27;s Up Vox Box. I really loved it. I have dark skin so it tends to hold on to heat from the sun hours after. But with the HT After Sun lotion it was instantly cooled by the aloe vera and it was very light. But despite being light it moisturized very well. This was very important because again the sun dries out dark skin. I totally recommend this for a day out in the sun.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great beside the fact that it is a little sticky.  After it drys the stickiness goes away but I feel like there may be a slight film on my skin.  It smells pretty good, not overpowering.  I used it after the beach and I did not peel so I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this but it left my skin a little stickier than I wanted/expected. It was also difficult to rub in, especially if using when you&#x27;re skin is sunburned. Smells great though!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this when purchasing a 2-pack of their tanning dry oil 12spf (I recommend this as well). That last day of vacation I didn&#x27;t put anything on and ended up getting extremely burned all over. I decided to give this aloe/moisturizer a try since it&#x27;s all I had. I put it on for the next 4-5 days in the burned areas and I never ended up peeling, except for in the small of my back where I couldn&#x27;t reach well. Since I did end up peeling in the non-aloed part I missed, I can honestly say this product prevented the rest of my skin from peeling. It also helped to sooth the burn pain. I highly recommend this product and will be using it on all future burns. Not to mention it smells great.</li>
    <li> I got a moderate burn after a 7 hour canoe trip in late spring.  I was desperate for relief besides from aloe with lidocaine and found this at the store.  It smells great and has an instant cooling effect that I love.  Unfortunately, everywhere I applied this lotion peeled horribly and the areas I didn&#x27;t apply did not peel (like thigh area, just due to accessibility).  I used this stuff religiously because I did not want to peel, almost the entire bottle.  I also found it cakey when re applying, and it seemed to dry and flake off.  While I like the cooling effect and smell, I did not find it effective in preventing peeling.</li>
    <li> I was hopeful for this product because I like the cooling benefits of an after-sun gel but I also want the hydration of an after-sun lotion. I thought this product would be able to deliver both. Unfortunately that was not the case. While on vacation, I got a little too much sun on the back of my neck one day so I thought that would be a great time to try this out. I will admit that the product did help initially sooth the burn, but after it dried, it felt like the dried on film that you get with any other after-sun gel. I felt like I needed a shower after using it. It also did not seem to hydrate like I thought it would and it even seemed to dry out my skin. If you are looking for an after-sun soothing gel, this product would work, but if you want something with hydrating benefits, do not use this product.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  My husband got sunburnt and I used it on his back.  It worked really really well.</li>
    <li> This is admittedly my runner up for after sun, or after sun-burn days. My first is usually a pure aloe but it is sticky. The Hawaiian Tropic works well and makes my skin feel moist after a day at the lake or just out in the sun. I will continue to purchase it and use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is mild and not overpowering. It dries nice and there is no greasy or wet residue after applying.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It smells great and it keeps me from peeling after a sunburn.</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion not greasy</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Hawaiian Tropic &amp; I have dry skin.  This stuff is great but it is getting expensive &amp; the bottle is shrinking.  The product is great but overpriced</li>
    <li> This smells great. It soothes and cools the skin. Very nice.</li>
    <li> I adore this stuff! It goes on just like a lotion, and doesn&#x27;t give you that sticky-tacky aloe feel. I have very fair skin, but during my attempts at developing a base tan, I swear by this stuff to help prevent me from peeling or my skin getting too try and agitated. Will definitely continue to use all summer long. It has a nice smell too! :)</li>
