      <li>My dermatologist recommended this product and I love it!</li>

      <li>The product I love.  </li>
      <li>I am 67 and my skin has never being better.</li>
      <li>I love Neova products.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>Love this product..  </li>
      <li>Like many others, I always used the lotions thai-sicl  and just can&#x27;t understand why the company discontinued it.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>Too cool to test the pool yet!</li>
      <li>Very pleased and really like that it has no color, the ti silc had a creamy beige color (like make-up)and sometimes stained the clothes.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and not too greasy, but a bit liquidy</li>
      <li>I apply this product daily in all seasons and my skin looks great.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I am aware of the controversial use of parabens, the fact that they have discovered in a handful of patients trace amounts in breast cancer tumors and that parabens mimic estrogen.</li>
      <li>I recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin and who needs good skin protection.  </li>
      <li>it really will stand up better than most to water.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
      <li>Good consistency for a physical sunblock.</li>
      <li>Visible when it first goes on, it is easy to see the spots you&#x27;ve missed.  </li>
      <li>This product creates a beautiful highlight under your make-up, and makes your skin feel really soft and smooth: While acting as a sunscreeen.  </li>
      <li>The protection is still excellent if you use enough, the sweat proof factor still works and it is still the only sunscreen I thrust to put all around my eyes and not feel it sting.</li>
      <li>It accomplishes exactly what the aesthetics person said it would accomplish.  </li>
      <li>( maybe that was their plan ; )</li>
      <li>My first time order this product &amp;#34;Neova DNA Damage Control&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>My eyes really get irritated.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m really allergic.  </li>
      <li>Give me back the original Ti-Silc Procyte...</li>
      <li>It does not spread evenly or easily over my face and within 10 minutes my face feels dry.</li>
      <li>I started using Neova after I first begun IPL laser treatments to remove sun/brown spots near my cheekbones.</li>
      <li>new version ( paraben free, such bs! ) is not emollient enough, the bottle is smaller and therefore you have to use more</li>
      <li>It seems to protect better than other products in my opinion!</li>
      <li>so when you open lid it sometimes drips out too quickly.  </li>
      <li>Use it everyday, only once and gives great lasting protection</li>
      <li>I live in Florida</li>
      <li>This is the new sport one</li>
      <li>They go on smooth and don&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like heavy greasy products as my skin is oily enough and have bought many that I can&#x27;t use..  </li>
      <li>Quick drying, odorless, non- sticky, leaves a slight shimmer to the skin.  </li>
      <li>I put Neova SPF 43 on daily after I shave and it protects my skin all day under normal activities.  </li>
      <li>( Not a single age spot or wrinkle on my face, hands or d&amp;eacute;colletage! )</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands that are a lot thicker and leave a very noticeable white film on your skin, but this does not.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands that are a lot thicker and leave a very noticeable white film on your skin, but this does not.</li>
<li> I have sensitive skin and get blocked pores when I use other SPF products, but not with Neova.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t had this long enough to give a review on the anti-aging qualities, however I had planned to wear this under makeup- however this cream is greasy...</li>
<li> I always use this when I expect to have a long day outside, for example, if out golfing.</li>
<li> I have used this for a few month and can&#x27;t live without.</li>
<li> I am SO disappointed that after 12 year of using this amazing product (formerly Sheer Ti-Silc 45), Procyte would succumb to political pressure and change this formula!</li>
<li> Gives the protection it promises- long walks in the spring sun and no sunburns!  </li>
<li> I have used &#x27;Neova DNA Damage Control Silc Sheer&#x27;, so when I saw Neova DNA Damage Control Active was on sale, I decided to try it.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little thicker then the Neova DNA Damage Control Silc Sheer, but I like it for the Arizona sun.</li>
<li> I expected it to be like ti-silc.</li>
<li> At first I was sad about T-Slic product that used for 15 years.</li>
<li> Will return as this active formula contains retinyl palmitate (vitamin A)&lt;br /&gt;Why risk using a product that could cause skin cancer when exposed to UV.</li>
<li> It also still always me to achieve the dark tan I want.</li>
<li> the other arm with another product.&lt;br /&gt;You will feel and see it!  </li>
<li> BUT, I have ordered twice through this seller and both times the product has arrived with a broken top so that it doesn&#x27;t stay closed (the first time I figured it was random bad luck).  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve previously used this product and like it.  </li>
<li> Cream was very thick, from the last one I had purchased.</li>
<li> Received product in error for the everyday formula.</li>
<li> I am one of those people who cant wear regular sunscreen because I always burn worse wherever I put it.</li>
<li> I wear it everyday!</li>
<li> This sunscreen doesn&#x27;t thin out when you perspire and drop down your face or into your eyes.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a bit thick (not greasy)</li>
<li> They introduced a new tinted version of another formula this year that has received terrible reviews so I need to continue using this product.</li>
<li> Works well but to expensive</li>
<li> So sad : (</li>
<li> Still disappointed that this manufacturer who bought Ti Silc has discontinued the tinted version.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product creates a beautiful highlight under your make-up, and makes your skin feel really soft and smooth: While acting as a sunscreeen.  Awesome !!!</li>
    <li> I use this all the time when I go outdoors especially for and extended period of time.  It seems to protect better than other products in my opinion!</li>
    <li> Good consistency for a physical sunblock. I&#x27;ve tried other brands that are a lot thicker and leave a very noticeable white film on your skin, but this does not.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product as a replacement for Ti-silc. Very pleased and really like that it has no color, the ti silc had a creamy beige color (like make-up)and sometimes stained the clothes.  Will continue to order</li>
    <li> The product I love.  Not greasy and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts even when worn during sports.  BUT, I have ordered twice through this seller and both times the product has arrived with a broken top so that it doesn&#x27;t stay closed (the first time I figured it was random bad luck).  Since, I want it for my gym bag I need to tape it shut which is a pain.</li>
    <li> I put Neova SPF 43 on daily after I shave and it protects my skin all day under normal activities.  When playing golf, I will reapply after the first nine holes and have received great protection of my skin.</li>
    <li> I used their sunblock before and I love it.  This is the new sport one and I&#x27;m really allergic.  The last 3 times input it on...I broke out.  My eyes really get irritated.  Wish I could get a return.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen doesn&#x27;t thin out when you perspire and drop down your face or into your eyes.  I love it!  This is a reorder.</li>
    <li> My first time order this product &amp;#34;Neova DNA Damage Control&#x27;.  I have used &#x27;Neova DNA Damage Control Silc Sheer&#x27;, so when I saw Neova DNA Damage Control Active was on sale, I decided to try it.  It&#x27;s a little thicker then the Neova DNA Damage Control Silc Sheer, but I like it for the Arizona sun.</li>
    <li> This product is untinted, I did not realize this when I ordered it. I expected it to be like ti-silc. It does not spread evenly or easily over my face and within 10 minutes my face feels dry. I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> My 87-year-old skin  is maintaining acne-free status for 25  years.  It accomplishes exactly what the aesthetics person said it would accomplish.  Thank You.</li>
    <li> Cream was very thick, from the last one I had purchased.</li>
    <li> Received product in error for the everyday formula. Will return as this active formula contains retinyl palmitate (vitamin A)&lt;br /&gt;Why risk using a product that could cause skin cancer when exposed to UV. Just my thoughts.</li>
    <li> This is a great sport sunscreen - it has awesome coverage and is very water repellant.  I always use this when I expect to have a long day outside, for example, if out golfing.</li>
    <li> I like this! I don&#x27;t like heavy greasy products as my skin is oily enough and have bought many that I can&#x27;t use..  This is light, blends in well and is excellent sun protection with the added benefits of being anti-aging and good for my skin.  I would definitely reorder this.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I am one of those people who cant wear regular sunscreen because I always burn worse wherever I put it. I have used this all summer and have yet to burn. It also still always me to achieve the dark tan I want. Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin and who needs good skin protection.  My dermatologist recommended it to me and all the Neova products have been great for my skin.</li>
    <li> Works well but to expensive</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this long enough to give a review on the anti-aging qualities, however I had planned to wear this under makeup- however this cream is greasy... It is not a product that just dissolves into the skin.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product and I love it! I wear it everyday!</li>
    <li> I am SO disappointed that after 12 year of using this amazing product (formerly Sheer Ti-Silc 45), Procyte would succumb to political pressure and change this formula! It was perfect the way it was and has protected my face, d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; and hands while also moisturizing. I have used Ti-Silc and retin-A and nothing else for years. I am 44 and look 34! ( Not a single age spot or wrinkle on my face, hands or d&amp;eacute;colletage! ) I owe this to Ti-Silc! Now I have to look for another moisturizer to \\&quot;glob\\&quot; on with my sunscreen...bummer! Give me back the original Ti-Silc Procyte...PLEASE!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This new version ( paraben free, such bs! ) is not emollient enough, the bottle is smaller and therefore you have to use more ( maybe that was their plan ; ) The protection is still excellent if you use enough, the sweat proof factor still works and it is still the only sunscreen I thrust to put all around my eyes and not feel it sting. ( even after a sweaty 5 mile run! )&lt;br /&gt;So...I am giving this a 3 star instead of 5. I have never written a review, but I really loved this product!!!! So sad : (&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I am aware of the controversial use of parabens, the fact that they have discovered in a handful of patients trace amounts in breast cancer tumors and that parabens mimic estrogen.</li>
    <li> Love this product..  I have been using it for years.  My skin looks lots younger than my age..  People always comment on how great my skin looks..  I did a test..  One week with Neova DNA damage..  the other arm with another product.&lt;br /&gt;You will feel and see it!  It&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Like many others, I always used the lotions thai-sicl  and just can&#x27;t understand why the company discontinued it.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday, only once and gives great lasting protection</li>
    <li> I use this sunblock when I plan to engage in activities that cause me to sweat a lot or when I go to the beach or pool. I live in Florida and I trust this product for protecting my skin on the hottest days! I reapply often to keep the protection going.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve previously used this product and like it.  It goes on smoothly and not too greasy, but a bit liquidy so when you open lid it sometimes drips out too quickly.  However, I thought if I bought a set of two it was cheaper than buying individually but it wouldn&#x27;t have been.  I saw it for $24 with shipping for one.  I paid $60 for a set.</li>
    <li> Still disappointed that this manufacturer who bought Ti Silc has discontinued the tinted version. The sizes get smaller, the price goes up and the variety still isn&#x27;t there. They introduced a new tinted version of another formula this year that has received terrible reviews so I need to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent none greasy sunscreen with zinc oxide for great protection</li>
    <li> Visible when it first goes on, it is easy to see the spots you&#x27;ve missed.  Quick drying, odorless, non- sticky, leaves a slight shimmer to the skin.  Gives the protection it promises- long walks in the spring sun and no sunburns!  Gave it five stars, as I&#x27;m betting it really will stand up better than most to water.  Too cool to test the pool yet!</li>
    <li> I love Neova products.  They go on smooth and don&#x27;t feel heavy. I have sensitive skin and get blocked pores when I use other SPF products, but not with Neova. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few month and can&#x27;t live without. I am 67 and my skin has never being better. Love it !!!</li>
    <li> At first I was sad about T-Slic product that used for 15 years. However, I use this produc for an year now and I&#x27;m happy with it. It does not absorb into the skin so well but I wait for couple minutes and it&#x27;s ok. I apply this product daily in all seasons and my skin looks great. I will continue to order.</li>
    <li> At the recommendation of my dermatologist, I have used this 43spf daily (rain or shine) for almost 10 years now. I started using Neova after I first begun IPL laser treatments to remove sun/brown spots near my cheekbones. I use about a tablespoon (not teaspoon) all over my face following my daily moisturizer.  It&#x27;s a bit thick (not greasy) but when you rub it well, it dissipates nicely.</li>
