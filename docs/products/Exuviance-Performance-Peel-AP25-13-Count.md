      <li>This product is worth the $$.</li>
      <li>A bit on the pricey side but worth the results.</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t have the money right now.</li>
      <li>Even those with larger pores will notice a big difference immediately, I use before applying makeup -there&#x27;s no drying or burn, makeup goes on like a breeze-  GREAT product, but I happen to find all Excuviance products well worth the money.  </li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d start leaving real ones to help balance it out!  </li>
      <li>I love it and will continue usuing it in the future.</li>
      <li>and unfortunately I do not see immediate results like that one reviewer did.</li>
      <li>facial wish I used years ago :-)</li>
      <li>The full effect lasts two days but if you do it regularly there is a marked overall improvement and the effect always looks great.</li>
      <li>I have been using them for about 3 weeks now and notice a big difference in the smoothness of my skin, minimized pores, discoloration a fading and fine lines smoothing out.  </li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>This did absolutely nothing for my face.  </li>
      <li>This product is better than I expected.</li>
      <li>Love the exuviance products eBay even sells shows results for less than spa prices of a one time</li>
      <li>so I would definitely purchase them again because they are easy to use and actually work</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
      <li>Results are evident in a short amount of time.</li>
      <li>I got these to get rid of fine lines that have appeared all over my forehead from the use of proactiv that was too harsh on my skin</li>
      <li>Has not really resolved some of my dark spots, but overall I am satisfied with what it has done.</li>
      <li>so the average wouldn&#x27;t change, since I can&#x27;t really tell yet.</li>
      <li>use the peel first to remove the dead skin cells.</li>

<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> I wasted what I feel a lot of money for a product that did nothing for me.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t used to post reviews, but I feel like Amazon&#x27;s reviews have been sketchy lately...</li>
<li> It was a bit expensive</li>
<li> I never had troubled skin</li>
<li> After using the product for six weeks I was very disappointed with the results.  </li>
<li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>

    <li> I got these to get rid of fine lines that have appeared all over my forehead from the use of proactiv that was too harsh on my skin and I am pleased with the results from using the all the pads twice a week, but I still have fine lines but they are a lot more diminished than they were before I used them so I would definitely purchase them again because they are easy to use and actually work I just don&#x27;t have the money right now.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works very well. Results are evident in a short amount of time. A bit on the pricey side but worth the results.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, works nicely</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have rosacea and blackheads. This does a nice cleaning job.</li>
    <li> I waited and hoped this product would show some type of difference.  I followed the instructions and I seen no difference...I wasted what I feel a lot of money for a product that did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> Shrinks pores perfectly. The full effect lasts two days but if you do it regularly there is a marked overall improvement and the effect always looks great. LOVE this product.</li>
    <li> These work great!  I have been using them for about 3 weeks now and notice a big difference in the smoothness of my skin, minimized pores, discoloration a fading and fine lines smoothing out.  I love this product and will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product 2x a week for 3 1/2 weeks. I definitely notice a smoother texture to my skin and some tightening. Has not really resolved some of my dark spots, but overall I am satisfied with what it has done.</li>
    <li> Thought it would work faster than a lemon, Nope.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Combined with Needling it works. I don&#x27;t do this alone. I do it along with &amp;#34;needling&amp;#34; (using a &amp;#34;derma roller&amp;#34; with needles that is rolled over the face and neck, scars, cellulite to diminish fine lines, wrinkles, scars and dimpling in the skin. It is like a laser treatment such as Thermage or Fraxil only you do it manually). Alone? It is OK. However, combined with needling the differences are noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the peel first to remove the dead skin cells. Then I wash my face again to remove the Exuviance acid and neutralizer. I sterilize the derma roller with rubbing alcohol. My skin is clean. The derma roller is clean. Then I do my needling. Then apply a moisturizer or serum. This combo has given me fantastic results. Derma rollers are available on Amazon or eBay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By doing the combo I get much more effective results and faster results. People tell me I am aging in reverse.</li>
    <li> I did alot of reviewing before I ordered this product. It was a bit expensive and I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money. I never had troubled skin but I wanted to improve my complextion and tone. This product did so. I love it and will continue usuing it in the future.</li>
    <li> Used this for years.  Wonderful for any type skin. Does a nice exfoliation without stripping the skin.</li>
    <li> This did absolutely nothing for my face.  I have leftover acne scars from my teens, 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s so I was hoping for just a little improvement.  Used it faithfully and used the entire box, but no change.</li>
    <li> I had hyper-pigmentation from laser treatments I had gotten years ago as a teenager for my acne. It completely cleared my skin of the weird orange color, but it took about 2 boxes for it to be fully gone. It really makes my skin look great, smooths the texture and clears my pores/acne.</li>
    <li> A must have for your skincare routine.  Keeps skin fresh, healthy, glowing and beautiful.  Can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
    <li> This product is insanely good for keeping your skin exfoliated and clear if you suffer from hormonal acne or routine breakouts.  I use the whole line and love it.  I do this twice a week, leave the peel on for about 15 minutes and afterwards my skin is like silk.  The price versus retail is unbeatable.  Great value.</li>
    <li> I love love love Exuviance products- and the Performance Peel, is the best!! Instant results! Instant gratification~ I will caution you, it is an acid, and the scent does resemble that off Nair or any of the hair removers, but not as strong- Simply clean your face. Open packett 1, wipe the pad (do not scrub) all over your face, and wait.  The recommended max time is 10 minutes, but as soon as you feel a little tingly or if your face starts to redden or blush, it&#x27;s time to remove.. There should be no burn-itch or discomfort. To remove you open packett 2 which is a neutrilizer, again, wipe, not scrub, then rinse your face- The minute you feel your face even during the rinsing, you will be amazed at the texture, the smoothness, the softness and the glow- It doesn&#x27;t dry you out, although mositurerizer is recommended after use- Your skin looks and feels wonderful. Even those with larger pores will notice a big difference immediately, I use before applying makeup -there&#x27;s no drying or burn, makeup goes on like a breeze-  GREAT product, but I happen to find all Excuviance products well worth the money.  I was a little concerned the product might be old since not buying it retail, but found no difference at all. SO this is a MUST try ladies- you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> Nice mild home chemical peel...</li>
    <li> I have been using since turning 50 and it gives my skin a glow. Sefunatwlt see a difference when i don&#x27;t use it!</li>
    <li> This is a great peel. I have been using it for several years now and recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> My second box of these peel pads. I love how the give a glow to my skin the day after application, and have seen brown marks and pores fade as I keep using.</li>
    <li> This product is better than I expected. I used Exuviance twice weekly as directed and I love my skin. I&#x27;m moving up to every other day,I&#x27;m starting to use it as a thorough cleansing. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Love the exuviance products eBay even sells shows results for less than spa prices of a one time facial wish I used years ago :-)</li>
    <li> Bought this product because it was recommend by a skin care sales person in Ulta&#x27;s.  It was quite pricey there so I bought it on line.  After using the product for six weeks I was very disappointed with the results.  I have hyper pigmentation on my cheeks and chin and was hoping to lessen the discoloration.  There was no visible change.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I can see a difference after only three uses!</li>
    <li> My first box I did twice a week and saw good results on for head and melasma but then when I started using less my results went away. Didn&#x27;t do anything for around my mouth area.</li>
    <li> After one use I can tell a difference in my skin. It looks much more even and \\&quot;refreshed\\&quot;.  This product is worth the $$. I have purchased it more than 3 times.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Ulta bc they do free returns if it doesn&#x27;t work.  I used it today and unfortunately I do not see immediate results like that one reviewer did. It didn&#x27;t sting and I was able to leave it on for the full 10 minutes, and now, a few hours later my face is slightly red but doesn&#x27;t feel bad or anything.  I put on some skin repair/anti aging stuff that I love and hopefully I will look amazing in the morning!  Haha, I bet it will take a few weeks to see results but I&#x27;ll keep you updated.  I didn&#x27;t used to post reviews, but I feel like Amazon&#x27;s reviews have been sketchy lately...like companies are enticing people to leave good ones, so I thought I&#x27;d start leaving real ones to help balance it out!  I gave it a 4 so the average wouldn&#x27;t change, since I can&#x27;t really tell yet.</li>
