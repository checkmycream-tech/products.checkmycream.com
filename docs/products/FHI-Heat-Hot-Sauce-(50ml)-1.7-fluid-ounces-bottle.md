### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I have purchased this product before and have been very happy with it.  </li>
      <li>However; this product is excellent.</li>
      <li>I have all the best products for frizz and straightening.</li>
      <li>After getting it out, It worked wonderfully.</li>
      <li>This stuff is GREAT!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s no Runway, but if it lasts more than a year, I&#x27;ll take my chances!!!</li>
      <li>It does help with the frizz and management of fly aways.</li>
      <li>I thought this was a great product when I received a sample with my FHI flatiron.  </li>
      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>Absolutely love it and the price is great!!!!</li>
      <li>Loved this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;FHI is a good company, but they don&#x27;t seem to be paying attention to Quality Assurance in their manufacturing process.</li>
      <li>Good luck</li>
      <li>Although I loved the product, I won&#x27;t purchase again unless they change the bottle.</li>
      <li>, it makes it even better!  </li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>I especially love the fast shipping from \\&quot;merchandise\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>its very easy if you wash your hair at night.</li>
      <li>But if you want some protection thrown in there when you use hot tools once in a while, this is a great choice</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t love it more for the price...</li>
      <li>I used to use the FHI Runway, but it&#x27;s honestly a wonderful flatiron with an EXTREEEEEMELY short shelf life.</li>
      <li>It also straightens my hair better than any straightner---I won&#x27;t do without it.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff I am hooked.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
      <li>FHI flat irons are awesome also, I know because I used to be a CHI user.</li>
      <li>best product to use when flat ironing hair</li>
      <li>this is the best product for dry and/or frizzy hair!  </li>
      <li>But, this is not about the runway, it&#x27;s about the Hot Sauce, which is amazing.</li>
      <li>My hair reverts perfectly with this though I will admit that if I keep my hair consistently straight for a month or more, the effect is an overall stretching of my curl pattern.</li>
      <li>After putting the product on my hair as directed and getting fabulous results.</li>
      <li>I wondered how it could have been so cheap.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, though, no actual DAMAGE, which is why I think this stuff is the absolute best.</li>
      <li>Inexpensive product that made my hair very smooth for flat ironing, I highly recommend, loved it.  </li>
      <li>They need to fix these problems, or risk losing their loyal customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Omni was quick to respond and sent me a replacement right away.</li>
      <li>after i wash my hair, it drys naturally, and its frizz free and smooth when i take it off.</li>
      <li>Great product if you have short hair that is in need of heat styling weekly such as mine!</li>
      <li>Thanks Omni for the quick response and no nonsense service.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love hot sauce - you don&#x27;t need to put much in your hair and it adds moisture and volume... a ton of volume that&#x27;s touchable and soft.  </li>
      <li>I am obsessed with Rihanna&#x27;s hair chameleon styles, so this product is great if you also like that short, funky and trendy spot on look!</li>
      <li>This has made my hair so healthy--and so pretty.</li>
      <li>It works great on thick hair.  </li>
      <li>When I ordered this product online it was shown in a hot sauce-looking bottle</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m sure there was a lot left in the bottle that I couldn&#x27;t get out.</li>
      <li>then i take my ponytail put it up on top of my head, and tie another bandana the opposite way and tie it by my forehead.  </li>
      <li>;)  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend HOT SAUCE for your hair!</li>
      <li>I got it and first of all you got to use a whole lot just to cover the hair</li>
      <li>For the first time, my straightened hair has body thanks to this product.</li>
      <li>No product residue; smells nice; cut straightening time by half.</li>
      <li>(make sure its dry though)  </li>
      <li>This is a very good product, just to expensive for me.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why hair products cost so much.</li>
      <li>I think it may not be the real product.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>my hair is super super dry and damaged and I am in the process of repair (hence buying this product).</li>
      <li>I noticed inmediately how smooth my hair was as I used my flat iron.</li>
      <li>In fact, ive stopped using any hot tools completely and my hair length and health has improved drastically.  </li>
      <li>there are real problems with the new 1.7 oz pump bottle.  </li>
      <li>and i highly reccommend it.  </li>
      <li>Also, when they did replace with new one, it is not an affective item.  </li>
      <li>This is apparently a new pump design that works on pressure rather than the old-fashioned straw.</li>
      <li>My first bottle of FHI Heat Sauce did not work properly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m rethinking the touch up I have scheduled with my stylist and may go natural now since the product has made my hair soooooo soft from tip to root, no kidding!</li>
      <li>and you certainly don&#x27;t want to run out since you will be instantly hooked.</li>
      <li>My hair feels soft and is shiny.</li>
      <li>so I the verdict is still out, but honestly I&#x27;m not quite sure what all the hype is about.</li>
      <li>The old formula in the 2 oz squeeze bottle was terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Theres a few chemicals that can be expected, but it also contains several ingredients that are good for the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you think that this is going to magically save your hair from the effects of a hot iron, your wrong.  </li>
      <li>One major flaw is that the pump DOESN&#x27;T WORK.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Better yet, they should just forget the pump bottle and bring back the old squeeze bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The ingredients seem well enough, not fantastic, not bad.  </li>
      <li>This is the only heat protectant that I&#x27;ve ever used that allows my natural 3c/4a hair to revert to its curls easily without random straight pieces hanging out.</li>
      <li>The new one needed to be pumped several times before it was \\&quot;primed\\&quot; enough to dispense.</li>
      <li>This product must be for caucasian folks because it certainly did nothing for my black ethnic hair.</li>
      <li>Previous products left my hair lifeless - this left it bouncy and shiny - all day (yet still pin straight!).</li>
      <li>Just keep in mind that if you hot iron your hair everyday, even with deep conditioners, and protective products such as these, your still not going to fully protect your hair from the damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Because my hair is so thick, I have to use a little more</li>

<li> However, the product I received from Amazon does not appear to be the same product I got with my flat iron.  </li>
<li> This product left me with super extra dry hair and also, the tube was open when I received and the pump is broken.</li>
<li> I will try it with a flat iron and see what happens but until then, this product does not work for nothing.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if I was using it with a curling iron and should have tried it with a flat iron</li>
<li> I purchased this product more for the bottle, as crazy as it sounds we all have collection of different items.</li>
<li> 1.7 fluid ounces idk why I expected it to be bigger) and the spray pump did not work.</li>
<li> I applied to my damp hair, then moisturized and sealed when dry and flat ironed.</li>
<li> In this line of hair product 10mls per bottle would have gone a long way.</li>
<li> There was nothing wrong with the old squeeze bottle in the first place.  </li>
<li> I mean, who wants to spend $450 for a flatiron that lasts one year?</li>
<li> I thought it would be a noticeable improvement to my hair after using a heated dryer, does not live up to it&#x27;s advertised description.</li>
<li> /&gt;Alternatives: This may sound crazy, but instead of flat ironing my course, curly hair, i use two bandanas.</li>
<li> i tie the first one around my forhead and tie it behind my ears then pull it back slightly.  </li>
<li> I used this product for two months, however my hair remained very dry and the amount of breakage did not improve.</li>
<li> My hair tends to be very dry and prone to breakage.</li>
<li> I only used a little but</li>
<li> At least Chi leaves my hair soft and shiney.</li>
<li> even so, it left a heavy waxy feel to my hair</li>
<li> It is expensive, but since it works its worth it.</li>
<li> big waste for me...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Inexpensive product that made my hair very smooth for flat ironing, I highly recommend, loved it.  I am going to order it again.  If you order, buy two, it&#x27;s not very big and you certainly don&#x27;t want to run out since you will be instantly hooked.</li>
    <li> Great product if you have short hair that is in need of heat styling weekly such as mine! I am obsessed with Rihanna&#x27;s hair chameleon styles, so this product is great if you also like that short, funky and trendy spot on look!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I noticed inmediately how smooth my hair was as I used my flat iron. My hair feels soft and is shiny.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It works great on thick hair.  I especially love the fast shipping from \\&quot;merchandise\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT!  Because my hair is so thick, I have to use a little more but that&#x27;s okay.  And for the price I got it at, it makes it even better!  I highly recommend HOT SAUCE for your hair!</li>
    <li> This product has worked wonders for my hair. I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for products but I feel compelled to do so. I am African American with relaxed hair in 10th week. After putting the product on my hair as directed and getting fabulous results. I&#x27;m rethinking the touch up I have scheduled with my stylist and may go natural now since the product has made my hair soooooo soft from tip to root, no kidding! Ps. FHI flat irons are awesome also, I know because I used to be a CHI user.</li>
    <li> This product must be for caucasian folks because it certainly did nothing for my black ethnic hair. After reading all the reviews on it I just had to have it. I got it and first of all you got to use a whole lot just to cover the hair and it does not make it shine. I don&#x27;t know if I was using it with a curling iron and should have tried it with a flat iron but it should have produced the same results. I will try it with a flat iron and see what happens but until then, this product does not work for nothing.</li>
    <li> For the first time, my straightened hair has body thanks to this product. Previous products left my hair lifeless - this left it bouncy and shiny - all day (yet still pin straight!). No product residue; smells nice; cut straightening time by half. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I read all the other reviews and decided to try this product. I only used a little but even so, it left a heavy waxy feel to my hair, I&#x27;m going to stick with Chi even though I don&#x27;t care for the way it smells. At least Chi leaves my hair soft and shiney.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why hair products cost so much. However; this product is excellent.I will continue to purchase it even at such an inflated cost.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for my hair. Nothing what so ever... I am African american with permed hair. big waste for me...</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of this.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product before and have been very happy with it.  This time i was sent a different product.  When I complained about it I was told that the packaging had changed, which is incorrect.  I have purchased both products and the packaging had nothing to do with it.  The product I requested was the Fhi Heat with crystalized jojoba and what I received was Fhi heat thermal heat-activated conditioner.  I am not a satisfied customer!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product.  I did not notice any improvement in using heat and the sauce.  I thought it would be a noticeable improvement to my hair after using a heated dryer, does not live up to it&#x27;s advertised description.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this once so I the verdict is still out, but honestly I&#x27;m not quite sure what all the hype is about. Caveat: my hair is super super dry and damaged and I am in the process of repair (hence buying this product). However, the bottle was teeny tine (1.7 fluid ounces idk why I expected it to be bigger) and the spray pump did not work. The product is a relatively thick (like a lotion) so I&#x27;m not sure why there is a spray to begin with-- the straw feeding into the bottle also only goes to the neck so I was just really confused and annoyed by the damn thing. I also did not use it to blowdry my hair (which is the only use listed on the bottle) because I airdryed. I applied to my damp hair, then moisturized and sealed when dry and flat ironed.</li>
    <li> The old formula in the 2 oz squeeze bottle was terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are real problems with the new 1.7 oz pump bottle.  One major flaw is that the pump DOESN&#x27;T WORK.  It has no central tube to feed the product to the pump.  You could pump all day, and it wouldn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FHI is a good company, but they don&#x27;t seem to be paying attention to Quality Assurance in their manufacturing process. They need to fix these problems, or risk losing their loyal customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better yet, they should just forget the pump bottle and bring back the old squeeze bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In trying to \\&quot;update\\&quot; their product with a pump bottle, FHI has messed things up.  There was nothing wrong with the old squeeze bottle in the first place.  IF IT AIN&#x27;T BROKE, DON&#x27;T FIX IT.</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d this item today and saw that it was different amount of Ounces than advertised. Advertised as 2 oz equalled to 60 mls. It comes as 1.7oz equal to 50mls. Considering the cost and I bought 2 bottles. Each one is shorted 10mls. than advertised. That is a total of 20mls of this expensive hair product Im out, since I bought 2 bottles. Not such a deal when added up.In this line of hair product 10mls per bottle would have gone a long way.</li>
    <li> Ingredients:  The ingredients seem well enough, not fantastic, not bad.  Theres a few chemicals that can be expected, but it also contains several ingredients that are good for the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:  If you think that this is going to magically save your hair from the effects of a hot iron, your wrong.  In fact, ive stopped using any hot tools completely and my hair length and health has improved drastically.  But if you want some protection thrown in there when you use hot tools once in a while, this is a great choice and i highly reccommend it.  Just keep in mind that if you hot iron your hair everyday, even with deep conditioners, and protective products such as these, your still not going to fully protect your hair from the damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternatives: This may sound crazy, but instead of flat ironing my course, curly hair, i use two bandanas. i tie the first one around my forhead and tie it behind my ears then pull it back slightly.  then i take my ponytail put it up on top of my head, and tie another bandana the opposite way and tie it by my forehead.  I then bobby pin them so it doesnt fall off while i sleep. i do this after i wash my hair, it drys naturally, and its frizz free and smooth when i take it off. (make sure its dry though)  then you can preceed to style your hair. its very easy if you wash your hair at night.</li>
    <li> Love the product but hate the container.  Has never pumped from day one.....I have to shake the product onto the counter.  Even too thick to shake out on my hand.  Messy and I won&#x27;t order again....</li>
    <li> This product left me with super extra dry hair and also, the tube was open when I received and the pump is broken. Not cool...</li>
    <li> I absolutely love hot sauce - you don&#x27;t need to put much in your hair and it adds moisture and volume... a ton of volume that&#x27;s touchable and soft.  It is expensive, but since it works its worth it.</li>
    <li> This item did not have the pump to get the lotion out.  Also, when they did replace with new one, it is not an affective item.  I don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
    <li> this is the best product for dry and/or frizzy hair!  Absolutely love it and the price is great!!!!</li>
    <li> Loved this product. But I&#x27;m sure there was a lot left in the bottle that I couldn&#x27;t get out. The pump dispenser broke shortly after I started using it.  So I had to pound it in my hand to get the product out. After getting it out, It worked wonderfully. Although I loved the product, I won&#x27;t purchase again unless they change the bottle. Since it is a hard bottle and can&#x27;t even squeeze out the remainder. So that&#x27;s why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a great product when I received a sample with my FHI flatiron.  Made my hair shiny and I had several compliments since I started using this product.  However, the product I received from Amazon does not appear to be the same product I got with my flat iron.  It seems like hand lotion in a bottle.  I think it may not be the real product.  I will not order items like this again. I wondered how it could have been so cheap.</li>
    <li> My hair tends to be very dry and prone to breakage. So, I was looking for a product that would condition, strenghten and protect my hair from heat damage. Which is what this product claims to do. I used this product for two months, however my hair remained very dry and the amount of breakage did not improve. Just not for me!</li>
    <li> I used to use the FHI Runway, but it&#x27;s honestly a wonderful flatiron with an EXTREEEEEMELY short shelf life. I mean, who wants to spend $450 for a flatiron that lasts one year? Not this girl. But, this is not about the runway, it&#x27;s about the Hot Sauce, which is amazing. This is the only heat protectant that I&#x27;ve ever used that allows my natural 3c/4a hair to revert to its curls easily without random straight pieces hanging out. I mean 450 degrees is a lot of heat. My hair reverts perfectly with this though I will admit that if I keep my hair consistently straight for a month or more, the effect is an overall stretching of my curl pattern. Otherwise, though, no actual DAMAGE, which is why I think this stuff is the absolute best. Also, I&#x27;m using the FHI Platform Plus and I couldn&#x27;t love it more for the price...it&#x27;s no Runway, but if it lasts more than a year, I&#x27;ll take my chances!!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff I am hooked. way cheaper to buy on amazon than in stores. i got mine in the mail shortly after ordering it. best product to use when flat ironing hair</li>
    <li> This is a very good product, just to expensive for me.  It does help with the frizz and management of fly aways.</li>
    <li> My hair was a scare crow rats nest! I have all the best products for frizz and straightening. After using FHI, all products went in the trash and to friends.  This has made my hair so healthy--and so pretty. I get compliments daily-- It also straightens my hair better than any straightner---I won&#x27;t do without it. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> My first bottle of FHI Heat Sauce did not work properly. The pump didn&#x27;t dispense, so I contacted Omni. After following their advice and pumping for over a minute, I finally gave up. This is apparently a new pump design that works on pressure rather than the old-fashioned straw. Omni was quick to respond and sent me a replacement right away. The new one needed to be pumped several times before it was \\&quot;primed\\&quot; enough to dispense. It initially came out in fits and starts, but it finally worked. Thanks Omni for the quick response and no nonsense service.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product more for the bottle, as crazy as it sounds we all have collection of different items. ;)  When I ordered this product online it was shown in a hot sauce-looking bottle but when I received my package it was just the typical bottle AND  broken. When I contacted the seller they were unhelpful, rude &amp; careless! To the point that they lost this valuable customer&#x27;s service! Good luck if buying from them, hopefully you&#x27;ll get what you thought you are/were paying for.....if not, don&#x27;t expect any customer service. :(</li>
    <li> It will make your hair sticky.  It also didn&#x27;t hold back the frizz or make it shine. I don&#x27;t understand the hype , I would not recommend this product .</li>
