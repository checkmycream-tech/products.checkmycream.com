      <li>So this review is a good assessment of the product, I&#x27;ve used it three times before posting the review.</li>
      <li>every time I go.&lt;br /&gt;It is so good that I have not used a &amp;#34;cream rinse&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34; in years, either.</li>
      <li>I loved the amount of leather i got with this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d read online that this was a good clarifying shampoo</li>
      <li>This is a real great product I have been using all there products and it works very very very well</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>Nice shampoo for all hair types.</li>
      <li>I tend to get kind of carried away about stuff.</li>
      <li>Either way, my hair is healthy and very happy when it gets what it wants, and I guess it likes this.</li>
      <li>Finding a great product at the right price makes you want to break out the confetti and champagne.</li>
      <li>Just read the list of ingredients on the picture I uploaded, and I should not have to add much more...</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>There are many organic, stimulating-claiming shampoos out there</li>
      <li>Ok, wait.</li>
      <li>By the way ladies, hair growth DOES mostly have to do with genetics</li>
      <li>and I love it</li>
      <li>I love it when products do what they say they&#x27;re going to do.</li>
      <li>Its true when they say you should have a dynamic trio together for the best results.</li>
      <li>Provides great cleansing and my hair was soft and clean after shampooing.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel a tingle which is fine</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product and I will be ordering more in the near future.</li>
      <li>My hair was not manageable or tangle free.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a sulphate free shampoo girl</li>
      <li>My hair is in transistion, so when I was given a product sample I was eager to try another ORS product as the conditioner and moisturizers are fantastic for my hair.  </li>
      <li>super easy detangling and my hair NEVER detangles this easy...</li>
      <li>It was a good thing that this was my deep conditioning day.  </li>
      <li>I have psoriasis of the scalp and it can get extraordinarily out of hand--</li>
      <li>This shampoo is much better and cleanses your hair much more effectively than some of the more expensive shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>And yes, the first time I used it my scalp and hair broke into a ringing chorus of \\&quot;Ode to Joy\\&quot;!</li>
      <li>I bought this shampoo online at amazon because the price is worth it &amp;</li>
      <li>Personally for this product to work effectively there must be a lot of build up in your hair.</li>
      <li>Definitely makes my scalp squeaky clean, and I love the minty smell.</li>
      <li>I started combing my hair and the comb just slid right through my hair....</li>
      <li>my kids have very fine hair, and so, I&#x27;m going to try it on them, to see if it does the same for them!</li>
      <li>size I would love to buy larger quantities!</li>
      <li>I liked the smell and for me, the tingle some people wrote about, it was minimal.</li>
      <li>My hair had so much body after using this shampoo on the first try.</li>
      <li>I have tried many  dandruff shampoos including Kerecare dry and itchy scalp.  </li>
      <li>I am on a healthy relaxed hair journey and suffer from dry and oily scalp.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a dry scalp or need repair to my hair, so I&#x27;m not quite sure how I came to use this one in particular, but, I was amazed to find that after using it for a couple of weeks, my hair feels so much fuller!  </li>
      <li>Thanks for reading, and reply if you think I can answer any questions about my experience with the shampoo or conditioner.</li>
      <li>It really cleanses.</li>
      <li>The Uplifting Shampoo cleans the scalp very well and does NOT irritate it.</li>
      <li>I have used this for years, and my hair is silky, shiny and very healty.</li>
      <li>They have several plant mixes, and all of it is plant-based, animal cruelty free, and organic.</li>
      <li>it cleaned my hair very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but when I need that extra clean I use this.  </li>
      <li>My hair loves this product and it is now going to be my main shampoo.</li>
      <li>First of all, this shampoo has a gentle minty scent, just enough fragrance to smell up close rather than across the room.</li>
      <li>Furthermore, the two items I would use separately and sometimes together only led to more buildup and no real moisture to my hair and scalp.</li>
      <li>I completely recommend the Organic Root Stimulator products!     </li>
      <li>it also has to do with daily trims &amp; moisture, regardless if your hair is VERY oily or not!</li>
      <li>anyway, my hair is long, thick, and nearly to my waist, and the suds were gentle but rinsed out thoroughly, leaving it soft and very fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The list of unpronounceable ingredients is very long, and they are on the top of the list, which means that the few plant-based extracts are in the absolute minority in this mix.</li>
      <li>I DEVELOPED AN ALLERGY TO ONE OF THE INGREDIENTS.</li>
      <li>has never been so soft.</li>
      <li>I only hope that it will soon be available in a size larger than the current 9 oz.</li>
      <li>I know the ingredients are not ALL natural, but I decided to give it a try on my natural hair.</li>
      <li>My natural hair is color treated with a 3c/4a curl pattern.</li>
      <li>My hair does not get stripped of its natural oils.</li>
      <li>I am not big on any particular brand of shampoo unless it strips my hair beyond belief and makes it feels like straw.</li>
      <li>1 year later I used it on my 5 year old brother</li>
      <li>I was so surprised I actually went back to read the bottle because I didn&#x27;t realize it detangled.</li>
      <li>This product caused my relaxed hair to be overly dried after the first use.</li>
      <li>Not only does it relieve the itching and reduce oil production, it does not dry out my hair!  </li>

<li> Hands down</li>
<li> Other than that, it does the trick!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> ONLY USED ONCE. I DEVELOPED AN ALLERGY TO ONE OF THE INGREDIENTS.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t order this again ...</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the ONLY medicated shampoo that I can use and get the results I need and WANT! I have psoriasis of the scalp and it can get extraordinarily out of hand--dry scalp, flakes, itchiness, etc. The Uplifting Shampoo cleans the scalp very well and does NOT irritate it. In extreme cases, my scalp irritation can affect my face. After using the shampoo alone, even my facial skin is no longer inflamed. People who have other dry scalp issues can also benefit from its use.     Hands down, I&#x27;ve been to dermatologists and the medicated shampoos they&#x27;ve prescribed have not worked, were over-rated, and way too expensive..I completely recommend the Organic Root Stimulator products!     I only hope that it will soon be available in a size larger than the current 9 oz. size I would love to buy larger quantities!</li>
    <li> I tried this product along with the almond oil scalp moisturizer and the Chinese herb-containing oil.  This product was suppose to remove buildup from hair and scalp, not leave it dry and my hair hard.  Also, the ingredients listed dries the hair and scalp and can also cause irritation.  Furthermore, the two items I would use separately and sometimes together only led to more buildup and no real moisture to my hair and scalp. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the labels or the commercials, and I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s Black-owned.  Quality over B.S.</li>
    <li> I bought this for 1 year ago and I love it the minty smell  and the tingling sensation.  I&#x27;m a sulphate free shampoo girl but when I need that extra clean I use this.  However fastforward 1 year later I used it on my 5 year old brother he has a scalp condition and we constantly have to keep his hair low. Tea tree oil didn&#x27;t help even shampoos with salicylic acid.  But this shampoo did he&#x27;s so happy he doesn&#x27;t get teased anymore.  I&#x27;m so happy I decided to use it on him.</li>
    <li> This product caused my relaxed hair to be overly dried after the first use. My hair was not manageable or tangle free. This item was on sale at a beauty supplies store. I will not use this product again but still like other Olive Oil products.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Gives a deep cleaning n you can feel.the difference</li>
    <li> I like the way it feels on my scalp. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a real great product I have been using all there products and it works very very very well</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product and I will be ordering more in the near future.</li>
    <li> Personally for this product to work effectively there must be a lot of build up in your hair. Otherwise it just stripping your hair. But I do like the hair fertilizer and hair mayonnaise. Its true when they say you should have a dynamic trio together for the best results.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have found this shampoo.  I am on a healthy relaxed hair journey and suffer from dry and oily scalp.  I have tried many  dandruff shampoos including Kerecare dry and itchy scalp.  All dandruff shampoos dry out my hair and don&#x27;t seem to give me the result I need to relieve the itching.  OMG, this shampoo is awesome.  Not only does it relieve the itching and reduce oil production, it does not dry out my hair!  I still follow up with a moisturizing shampoo, however if I didn&#x27;t my hair still doesn&#x27;t feel dry while using this shampoo.  I will definitely continue to use this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I recently was suffering with a very irritated scalp and started using this shampoo again after using it in the past and within two days of using it the discomfort in my scalp was gone and my hair wasn&#x27;t left feeling hard, dry or brittle.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know that these products were created for women of color.  I don&#x27;t have a dry scalp or need repair to my hair, so I&#x27;m not quite sure how I came to use this one in particular, but, I was amazed to find that after using it for a couple of weeks, my hair feels so much fuller!  I love it!  my kids have very fine hair, and so, I&#x27;m going to try it on them, to see if it does the same for them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d read online that this was a good clarifying shampoo so I expected it to strip my hair completely and leave it dry and brittle. After washing my hair with this product, the results were quite the opposite. I started combing my hair and the comb just slid right through my hair....super easy detangling and my hair NEVER detangles this easy...and this is with new growth which is very kinky and tough! I was so surprised I actually went back to read the bottle because I didn&#x27;t realize it detangled. My hair was not left dry or brittle. I was greatly impressed! I now use this shampoo on a weekly basis. I love it when products do what they say they&#x27;re going to do. This one will be a definite keeper!    So this review is a good assessment of the product, I&#x27;ve used it three times before posting the review.</li>
    <li> I get an itchy scalp if I shampoo too often or not enough but I hate all those dandruff shampoos since I don&#x27;t have dandruff.  I had a lot of hair shedding and it has now stopped I use it every other day in combination with WEN conditioner and my hair has never been so soft.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo for all hair types. Provides great cleansing and my hair was soft and clean after shampooing.</li>
    <li> First of all, this shampoo has a gentle minty scent, just enough fragrance to smell up close rather than across the room. And yes, the first time I used it my scalp and hair broke into a ringing chorus of \\&quot;Ode to Joy\\&quot;! You should have been there...anyway, my hair is long, thick, and nearly to my waist, and the suds were gentle but rinsed out thoroughly, leaving it soft and very fresh and clean. And it leaves your scalp tingling with life. This shampoo is much better and cleanses your hair much more effectively than some of the more expensive shampoos I&#x27;ve tried. Finding a great product at the right price makes you want to break out the confetti and champagne. Ok, wait. I tend to get kind of carried away about stuff. My WonderCat Donut just looks at me sometimes, but I don&#x27;t think you can embarrass a cat...can you? But I intend to stick with this shampoo. Oh, if I could get the time back I&#x27;ve wasted on inferior products in my life! I also follow it up with either the OR Hair Mayonnaise or the Aloe Conditioner. Either way, my hair is healthy and very happy when it gets what it wants, and I guess it likes this. Give it a try! Thanks for reading, and reply if you think I can answer any questions about my experience with the shampoo or conditioner. I&#x27;d be happy to.</li>
    <li> Just read the list of ingredients on the picture I uploaded, and I should not have to add much more... but...&lt;br /&gt;I tried the shampoo this morning, and it did burn my eyes.  Note to folks who are allergic to nightshade plants: there is capsicum in it, which translates to peppers, as in chilli peppers, for example.&lt;br /&gt;The list of unpronounceable ingredients is very long, and they are on the top of the list, which means that the few plant-based extracts are in the absolute minority in this mix. I would like an explanation as to why items like &amp;#34;disodium dimethicone copolyol&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;olealkonium chloride&amp;#34; can be called organic, just to pick two of this endless list of unpronounceable items.&lt;br /&gt;The worst and truly unnecessary part is the color. Why oh why do people who claim to manufacture anything &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;,  think they also have to put colorants into the mix?? A clear, non artificially product is preferable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And because there will be readers who want to know what product I use, here it is: Nature&#x27;s Gate. They have several plant mixes, and all of it is plant-based, animal cruelty free, and organic. I have used this for years, and my hair is silky, shiny and very healty. I get compliments from hairdressers every time I go.&lt;br /&gt;It is so good that I have not used a &amp;#34;cream rinse&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34; in years, either. No need. My hair does not get stripped of its natural oils. Hence, there is no need to regularly strip-wash it. You only need to do that if you use commercial conditioners.</li>
    <li> As described! This Shampoo leaves your scalp tingling like a peppermint perm! ahhhh</li>
    <li> I got this product for my husband. I bought 2 bottles for him and he used them both. Well, no results at all, we weren&#x27;t expecting miracles but at least something.</li>
    <li> My hair is in transistion, so when I was given a product sample I was eager to try another ORS product as the conditioner and moisturizers are fantastic for my hair.  I felt the Uplifting Shampoo stripping my hair during the wash (but not as badly as Hair One does).  During the wash my hair went from wet and slippy to filling like a wet brillo pad.  It was a good thing that this was my deep conditioning day.  But, I have been suffering from itchy patchy flaky skalp all week.  Can&#x27;t stand the burning and itching.  This didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I always research products a thousand times over before I buy them! There are many organic, stimulating-claiming shampoos out there so I was very careful as to which one I wanted to purchase. I bought this shampoo online at amazon because the price is worth it &amp; it TRULY does do what it says! I have a very, dry, somewhat itchy BUT oily scalp! This is a great clarifying scalp shampoo as well as an AMAZING scalp stimulator! If any of you are wondering about hair growth, this shampoo is for you! I have only been using it for a month now, and my hair grows very slow! I just got about 4 inches (of split ends) chopped a month ago and my hair has already grown 1/2 an inch this month! I use it every other day and use the emu oil conditioner. By the way ladies, hair growth DOES mostly have to do with genetics it also has to do with daily trims &amp; moisture, regardless if your hair is VERY oily or not! I recommend this shampoo for anyone with dry, stubborn hair! It will remove any dead skin cells blocking hair follicles in pores and open up those stubborn pores! &amp; When pores open up, your blood vessels (inside the pores) are given oxygen, which further stimulates the hair to finally GROW! I just wish there was a bigger bottle. I just found out that you may also purchase this shampoo at Sally&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Got this shampoo in a recent hairbox subscription. I know the ingredients are not ALL natural, but I decided to give it a try on my natural hair. My natural hair is color treated with a 3c/4a curl pattern. I am not big on any particular brand of shampoo unless it strips my hair beyond belief and makes it feels like straw. This does NOT do this at all. My hair had so much body after using this shampoo on the first try. I could not believe how it made my curls pop and it is hard to find products that pronounce my curls. I liked the smell and for me, the tingle some people wrote about, it was minimal. My hair loves this product and it is now going to be my main shampoo.</li>
    <li> No it did not do anything at all this is not a good product</li>
    <li> This product was great . I loved the amount of leather i got with this product. it cleaned my hair very well.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> It really cleanses. I don&#x27;t feel a tingle which is fine and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> i broke the \\&quot;green head\\&quot; of the shampoo. sad. smells like the jam that i eat.... lol. anyway, just i hate the \\&quot;head\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. I didn&#x27;t know about anyone else but I like it</li>
    <li> Definitely makes my scalp squeaky clean, and I love the minty smell. After I use it though, my hair feels drier than it was, so it&#x27;s not exactly a conditioner. Other than that, it does the trick!</li>
    <li> i just started using this product and it feels great.  initially i did feel a tingley sensation but not after continued use.  i would recommend this product because of the way my hair feels after shampooing.</li>
