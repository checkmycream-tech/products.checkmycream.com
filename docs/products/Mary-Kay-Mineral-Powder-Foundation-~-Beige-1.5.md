      <li>It is certainly a close second, if you want to save some money this will be a fine powder to try.  </li>
      <li>As advertised, shipped fast.</li>
      <li>It also blends with the skin color very well.</li>
      <li>I really need</li>
      <li>I love this product lasts all day and night matches my extremely tanned skin I am always in the sun getting my bronze on.perfect</li>
      <li>The price is reasonable if you compare it to the high end brands and for the quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use a light Mary Kay foundation and then gently, loosely powder over with this mineral product that helps set my makeup.  </li>
      <li>Thumbs up, highly recommended.</li>
      <li>First I use Mary Kay Moisturizer, then Mary Kay Primer, and then a little cover up on a few tiny red veins, and then this beautiful light powderly foundation.  </li>
      <li>I believe the coverage is a little better than what I have used, but I don&#x27;t feel this lasts through the day.</li>
      <li>love the Beige 1.5, I usually wear Beige 1 in the winter and 2 in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Looks very natural and not heavy, if you use it this way.</li>
      <li>I really like this because it is so light feeling , almost feels like you have no makeup on at all , the only thing I don&#x27;t like is after a few hours my oily skin starts to show as with any makeup I have used .</li>
      <li>natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I would have tried a different shade, but I really didn&#x27;t care for the amount of coverage...or lack thereof.</li>
      <li>It was a good product, just ordered the wrong color.</li>
      <li>I think, overall, this product may be a good product, but to use it is extremely difficult; especially if you are concerned about shaking too much out and then wasting it.</li>
      <li>I ordered it too dark at 1.5 beige, thinking that since I&#x27;m olive toned with a bit of summer tan, it would be just right.</li>
      <li>The seller was very expedient, and I received the product before expected delivery.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so light that there are no lines, and I don&#x27;t look dirty with too much bronzer.</li>

    <li> I have been using a different, popular brand of mineral powder for eight years. I wanted more coverage, so I have been trying different brands. I believe the coverage is a little better than what I have used, but I don&#x27;t feel this lasts through the day. I will probably not reorder.</li>
    <li> Just as expected, excellent product.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay mineral powder is absolutely perfect for my skin. It Is applied smoothly onto my skin giving out a flawless look. I&#x27;ve tried other mineral foundation which always thens to dry or irritate my delicate skin. But nothing compares to this product. Although Mary Kay is quite expensive throughtheir website, I always suggest to buy from amazon. But make sure the seller is truthful with their products.</li>
    <li> I really like this because it is so light feeling , almost feels like you have no makeup on at all , the only thing I don&#x27;t like is after a few hours my oily skin starts to show as with any makeup I have used . But other than that it&#x27;s great !</li>

    <li> This is my favorite foundation for the summer. Light-weight and easy to reapply as needed.</li>
    <li> great foundation to set makeup especially in the summer</li>
    <li> It was a good product, just ordered the wrong color. Ill have to find out wat color I really need</li>

    <li> This foundation makes my skin looks great. It does not make me look cakey. It also blends with the skin color very well. Excellent foundation.</li>
    <li> I like this foundation.  First I use Mary Kay Moisturizer, then Mary Kay Primer, and then a little cover up on a few tiny red veins, and then this beautiful light powderly foundation.  I don&#x27;t look &amp;#34;made up!&amp;#34;  Just nice smooth skin.</li>
    <li> I totally love Mary KAY minerals ..looks so natural and feels so light..easy to apply with the right Kabul brush ....I rate 5 Stars with a big smile!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome foundation. Goes on very light and is pretty unnoticeable. Not too great if you&#x27;re trying to cover something up (even after concealer) but I just needed it to even out my skin tone.</li>
    <li> As advertised, shipped fast.</li>
    <li> With the foundation that I used of Mary Kay, this product gives me a perfect natural look at my face and it blends very easily.</li>
    <li> good quality. A little bit goes a long way. great value. Feels like I have nothing on but the results were just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this product. The product itself is very good. However, it is a pain to get out enough to use it. I had to flip the tabs, and shake vigorously just to get a little bit to come out. I think, overall, this product may be a good product, but to use it is extremely difficult; especially if you are concerned about shaking too much out and then wasting it. The seller was very expedient, and I received the product before expected delivery.</li>
    <li> Price is UNbeatable!&lt;br /&gt;The coverage can be varied based on the type of brush you use, and how you apply.&lt;br /&gt;This product works great by itself or with foundation underneath.&lt;br /&gt;Very natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I love the Beige 1.5, I usually wear Beige 1 in the winter and 2 in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;This product is perfect for spring when I don&#x27;t quite have a tan, but I also don&#x27;t want to look like a ghost. It&#x27;s so light that there are no lines, and I don&#x27;t look dirty with too much bronzer.</li>
    <li> Smooth! color blends well with other shades for perfect match.</li>
    <li> I bought this foundation to try in comparison to BareMinerals powder.  It is certainly a close second, if you want to save some money this will be a fine powder to try.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to last quite as long as bareminerals and color seems to be a tiny bit darker than the comparable beige of bareminerals.  Good medium light shade though, feels light on the skin.</li>
    <li> This is a nice big size, not small like the BMs and others sold in high end dept stores. The cap measures 2-1/2 inches across the top. That&#x27;ll give you an idea of the size. I&#x27;ve been impressed as it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve tried Mary Kay&#x27;s mineral foundation. The price is reasonable if you compare it to the high end brands and for the quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had was in choosing the color. I ordered it too dark at 1.5 beige, thinking that since I&#x27;m olive toned with a bit of summer tan, it would be just right. Next time, in winter, I will go lighter a notch to the 1.0 beige. It&#x27;s hard to tell from the color samples online. I kept it and am using it mostly as a blush/bronzer and liking it a lot. I ordered the primer for it which another reviewer recommended, and it glides on like silk. Glad I bought that too. I love it and it makes your foundation blend better and stay on. Thumbs up, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this product lasts all day and night matches my extremely tanned skin I am always in the sun getting my bronze on.perfect better than bare minerals cheaper too</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a number of years and love it! Comes in several shades as my skin color changes with the season. Light weight on my skin - my skin care specialist was pleased that I was using this.</li>
    <li> The color was a bit on the orange side.  I would have tried a different shade, but I really didn&#x27;t care for the amount of coverage...or lack thereof.</li>
