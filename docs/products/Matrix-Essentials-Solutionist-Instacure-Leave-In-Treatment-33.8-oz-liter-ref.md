      <li>&gt; #winning</li>
      <li>It was a great product before; Since they are now making gallons of it, it is too diluted and does not work much at all.</li>
      <li>Love that I can get this on Amazon.</li>

      <li>love this stuff fast shipping</li>
      <li>use of this &amp; my hair has grown SO much !!</li>
      <li>Instantly feels better after each use , will not go without it !</li>
      <li>/&gt;That said, I think it will be useful</li>
      <li>This  product is more of a liquid with a not very user friendly opening.  </li>
      <li>I have used it for years and was glad to find it in this larger size.</li>
      <li>Really helps with the knots when brushing!</li>
      <li>Great product for my daughters thick &amp; curly hair.</li>
      <li>This is a great value for the size and price since stylist sells it more expensive !</li>

      <li>So much cheaper than getting it in the salon.  </li>

      <li>I spray this in my bleached hair every day when I&#x27;m getting ready.  </li>
      <li>Get the big size to refill your own spray bottle and it will last forever.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this.  </li>
      <li>just an open (and very runny) bottle opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have had another product with a similar name that was useful for this but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere when the bottle ran dry.  </li>
      <li>Have long curly hair, and curly hair can be kind of dry and hard to deal with.</li>
      <li>and it really help to tame this wild mane.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Arrived on time and was just what I  ordered.  The price was also good.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item to help with my hair&#x27;s static electricity , but I cannot tell any difference in using it.</li>
    <li> I use this after every shampoo to condition and protect the color in my hair.  My beautician recommended it and I use it all the&lt;br /&gt;time.</li>
    <li> good product, good price</li>
    <li> These products are fantastic I will continue to use and buy!</li>
    <li> I spray this in my bleached hair every day when I&#x27;m getting ready.  It&#x27;s mild but really helps with dryness both in my color treated hair and the desert air I live in.  I highly recommend this.  Get the big size to refill your own spray bottle and it will last forever.  You&#x27;ll need a spray bottle for refiling.  Fabulous product and a good price.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It&#x27;s great!  Gives my curly hair body and keeps away the frizz!</li>
    <li> Have used this under another name some years ago.  It is great stuff.  It used to be called Perm-Fresh and it does what it says it will do.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with product.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that has ever helped my hair and it is a must have for me!  And I am very happy with the size of the bottle, the item was received quickly and the price was great.</li>
    <li> Great product for my daughters thick &amp; curly hair. Really helps with the knots when brushing! My daughter loves the smell too!</li>
    <li> Great product. Timely delivery.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this leave conditioner!! I have used it for years on my hair and it has helped my hair so much to keep it from drying out.  This is the best product on the market for my hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing product ! My brittle damaged bleached hair has been transformed by this leave in treatment my hair stylist got me using ! My hair would not grow and continue to break in a vicious color and bleach cycle , then I used this and it has grown so much over past 3 months ! Instantly feels better after each use , will not go without it ! This is a great value for the size and price since stylist sells it more expensive !</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff! Have given samples to my friends for their kids&#x27; hair. Great detangler that I use on my daughter&#x27;s hair wet or dry.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  That is all that needs to be said.  Just buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and bought this from my hair lady who retired recently.  I was hoping to find it at Amazon and once again, I was not disappointed.  Love this product, use it every morning, and you don&#x27;t have to rinse it out.  It helps me - I have fine hair and it gives it a bit more body.</li>
    <li> Have long curly hair, and curly hair can be kind of dry and hard to deal with. Been using this product for years and it really help to tame this wild mane. Love that I can get this on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair so I get perms about every 4-5 months I use this product to help with the frizz, works great</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff</li>
    <li> I have used Matrix Instacure for at least 6 years. It was a great product before; Since they are now making gallons of it, it is too diluted and does not work much at all. I probably will stop buying after these two bottles are gone. I hope I can find something as good as this product used to be two years ago.</li>
    <li> Instacure is a wonderful product. I use it as a detangler, I freshen up my curly hair with it. But the best part is what it does to your hair. It fills in the pores of your hair and protects it, makes it healthy with continuous use. I just can&#x27;t be without it!</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this on Amazon.  It costs a bit more than I wanted to spend but it was just what I needed.</li>
    <li> This product totally reconditions hair that is chemically treated so well.  I have used it for years and was glad to find it in this larger size.</li>
    <li> This leave-in treatment is very good at controlling frizz.  It does not make your hair dull and does not take a lot to do it&#x27;s job. Have used for MANY years...glad they still make it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, it&#x27;s the only thing I have found that works on static electricity in my hair and bonus it&#x27;s a leave in conditioner that also works great.  It is hard to find as I haven&#x27;t found it anywhere other Martrix products are sold. So glad I found it here! Will be reordering it when I run out.  If you live in a cold climate you need this, especially if you have gas heat!!</li>
    <li> Terrific - couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the stores by me</li>
    <li> I thought this was a mousse like cream I could use to tame frizzy hair.  I have had another product with a similar name that was useful for this but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere when the bottle ran dry.  This  product is more of a liquid with a not very user friendly opening.  No spray, no nozzle, just an open (and very runny) bottle opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I think it will be useful once I get a spray bottle to transfer it into.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT, WHEN IT COMES TO HAIR STYLE, A GOOD QUALITY PRODUCT IS WHAT YOU NEED. IT WILL MAKE YOUR JOB EASIER.  I STRONGLY RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT. A++++++</li>
    <li> Love the price and the product.  So much cheaper than getting it in the salon.  I refill a small squirt bottle for travel, too.</li>
    <li> love this stuff fast shipping</li>
    <li> I have curly hair - it defines the curls - keeps them longer - a stops the end of the day frizz.</li>
    <li> daily user.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t function without this !!&lt;br /&gt;as soon as I get out of the shower, I put this in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I changed hair stylists about 3 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;my hair wuz SO Damaged.  (thatz another story)&lt;br /&gt;daily use of this &amp; my hair has grown SO much !!&lt;br /&gt;my new hair stylist doesn&#x27;t need to trim my ends every visit now !!&lt;br /&gt; #winning</li>
