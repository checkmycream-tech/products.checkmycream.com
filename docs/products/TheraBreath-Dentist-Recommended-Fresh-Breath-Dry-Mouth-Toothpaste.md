<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No good at all ,taste very bad</li>
    <li> My wife says my breath smells better. It does smell better. And so, I&#x27;ll continue to use this product. I also use the mouthwash, and follow the directions as stated.&lt;br /&gt;Sure, it&#x27;s more expensive than 99 cent colgate, but I believe it&#x27;s a better product.&lt;br /&gt;It, as the label says, DOES NOT contain detergents, not SLS or any other derivative. Some of the reviews here are wrong.</li>
    <li> I bought this due to it&#x27;s claim for canker sores. I gave the toothpaste a good trial at around 3 months and only at the beginning did I not have a canker sore. After that I often had multiple sores. Works well on breath, but for canker sores it was worse than regular toothpaste. After giving up on the toothpaste I went back to Sqigle and have been almost canker free since. I just wish Sqigle had a better whitening property.</li>
    <li> Is it effective? No way.</li>
    <li> Works very well. The toothpaste takes some getting used to since its flavorless and clear. I&#x27;ve been using crest since birth. Cures morning breath.</li>
    <li> Used to clean tone is useful. But after pregnancy, sometimes feel after brushing my teeth want to retch, suitable for pregnant women to do not know.</li>
    <li> this stuff works.  drys your mouth a little but it is good.  i will definitely recommend&lt;br /&gt;it to anyone who has breath issues</li>
    <li> Excelent product, Ill definitly buy other again , it looks as it will  last for ever great buy,thanks again amazon for a great product</li>
    <li> The BEST!  Saved me from putting my husband out of the bed.</li>
    <li> Another of the Biotene users that were left searching for a new toothpaste. This product performs far better than the Biotene ever did! Brush at night and I can wake up with breath that&#x27;s pretty darn fresh! The taste is pleasant, and the formula is mild. As someone who suffers from dry mouth, I&#x27;m glad to have found this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I get tonsil stones sometimes and I feel like my breath smells like the stones (which is awful!) The instructions on the back say to use on a dry toothbrush. This toothpaste does not foam up so it is quite harsh on your gums if you use a dry brush. The taste is neutral, but it does help with keeping bad breath away. As far as using it for tonsil stones, I would suggest the mouth wash instead. This toothpaste would be good to use after a regular toothpaste just for the breath aspect. I never felt like my teeth were really clean when using this alone. But again, it does help with bad breath. So this is why I have mixed emotions on it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle.  Have been using for years, and I will never use anything else.  People never back away because of my nasty breath anymore!</li>
    <li> We have used this toothpaste and the mouthwash for 5+ years. It has worked wonders to get rid of bad breath. I love using the mouthwash after my morning coffee. I wish they made a small travel brand that I could keep on me at all times.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Makes my breath taste like nothing. I used to suck mints all day, especially when I was talking with people. Now, I don&#x27;t need them at all. My breath is fresh all day long. It is truly amazing. You must try this if you have any breath problems. It&#x27;s changed my life. I&#x27;m so much more confident. Thanks Dr. Katz!!</li>
    <li> After suffering almost two weeks with 14 canker sores in my mouth I went to the doctor to see if it was infected and it wasn&#x27;t but he told me they would have to go away on their own or he could give me a prescription for a mouth rinse that would not cure it but make it feel better i said ok...until i was told at the pharmacy it would cost me $50, i said they could keep it. I tried drinking everything with a straw, using benzocaine non stop, popping aleve and other pain killers, gargling constantly with hydrogen peroxide and or salt water, and some would go away just to have new ones pop up. after 3 weeks i could not take it anymore and researched online. i saw people said to avoid sodium lauryl sulfate and i saw some people recommending therabreath. I went to walgreens late that night to find this and bought the toothpaste and the mouth rinse. following all directions, i felt IMMEDIATE  relief. the next day i woke up and they are practically all gone..can only feel one, just slightly! need relief...buy this! my experience is true! i cannot believe it myself.</li>
    <li> good product, would buy again.</li>
    <li> I wish the make Bigger Sizes, a  bit too Spence, But good!</li>
    <li> I do not like the taste. My teeth sermed more yellow afyer using this toothpaste fir a few weeks.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste does not create a foam like other brands however; so far it appears to be effective in helping with bad breath. You have to get used to the taste. it is horrible at first especially since it does not foam. I agree with another posted comment to where some foods and drinks can taste different after using it which is not neccessarily a bad thing because I noticed it with sodas which I should not be drinking anyway. Beware-it can make drinks etc. taste funny. Other than that I really like it and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to open the snap top closing on the tube.  I even cut myself doing so. Other wise I  love the toothpaste.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist commented at my latest cleaning that she could find absolutely nothing to remove from my teeth.  This is a superior product that is worth its higher than normal cost.</li>
    <li> The mouth wash is great,  perfect.  But this toothpaste is not,  it says recommend by #1 dentist,  lol no dentist will recommend this tasye is nasty and u dont fell clean.  Sucks.</li>
    <li> I really loved the therabreath mouthwash so I decided to try the toothpaste and after brushing for 2 minutes, my mouth still tastes like I havent brushed at all.</li>
    <li> I think the extra strength is a better quality product and would spend the extra money on that instead.</li>
    <li> Effective product for persisent bad breath odors.  It actually kills the bacteria that causes the bad odors.  As opposed to more common commercial \\&quot;mouthwashes\\&quot; that usually cover and mask the bad odor for a time, when used regularly in conjuction with the Oral Rinse, this product is very effective in controlling and eliminating chronic bad breath.</li>
    <li> Their toothpaste is formulated to help stop bad breath, help with gum health and fight cavities. Their toothpaste is also designed to control the anaerobic bacteria which is what causes bad breath. With this my hubby and me both tried this out. I was super surprised how well it worked with bad breath with the season right now sinus problems are pretty bad which is where our bad breath comes from. After using this we really were able to tell a difference in our breath. Plus how clean our teeth was afterwards was amazing.</li>
    <li> This tooth paste really do not do anything for me.  But the mouth wash has completely helped to get rid of my tonsil tones.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is a temporary remedy for what people think are bacteria. You will use the product for at least 4 times a day for the rest of his life and so have bad breath even after a long dinner with wine.    In my case the problem is with tonsil stones and you can see a video related to this issue on youtube! I hope this can serve you!    [..]</li>
    <li> The best toothpaste I have tried yet to keep my breath smelling sweet, clean and fresh for a long time and tastes good too!</li>
    <li> Amazing product for dry mouth , a lifesaver for me</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first to try this product. Sometimes I don&#x27;t trust a product that gets 5 star ratings all the time!  After doing a bunch of research, I decided to give both the rinse and toothpaste a try. It is well worth the price and works really  well.  I have had bad breath for over a year now and just recently discovered the reason was tonsil stones. As I researched these stones, TheraBreath kept popping up as a method to combat both bad breath and tonsil stones.  Yes, it does work. Both my partner and I are extremely pleased and relieved.  The bland taste is the only con but you have to realize there is no &#x27;junk&#x27; in these products as opposed to regular commercial dental products.</li>
    <li> Quality is very good, also buy this next time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for this toothpaste.  It does not remove plaque and leaves white residue around the lips that is difficult to remove.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste, along with the mouthwash, really helped fight gum disease. More than one dentist has commented on my healthy mouth.</li>
    <li> I was kind of Shocked to see that the paste is a clear gel. I&#x27;m used to the minty white and red in toothpaste. My mom uses this for my grandfather whom is in a nursing home. It has worked very well for him.</li>
    <li> The initial flavor &amp; texture are pleasant, less imposing than ordinary toothpastes. Unfortunately I am left with a sensation of my mouth being too dry afterwards which puts me off from the next use.</li>
    <li> Very weird toothpaste. I would say that it is effective. Leaves my mouth feeling clean. It is clear and somewhat flavorless. It is definitely the weirdest toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. Buy it if you want.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve lived on the face of this planet and used other well advertised toothpaste products for over four decades - I hope to never return to those products that exacerbated my nagging tonsil stone issues and appeared to have allowed coffee and tea products to stain my teeth - Twice daily use of TheraBreath toothpaste and TheraBreath rinse along with nightly tongue scrapping completely eliminated the tonsil stones, kept stains at bay, and has given me the freshest breath - THANK YOU TheraBreath!!!</li>
    <li> Purchased it together with the mouth wash It really works!!  I have been using it for two weeks and it worked the second day I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish i found this 10 years ago. I have tried many others, but this is the most effective.&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend said she loves me all again.&lt;br /&gt;This is a life saver.</li>
    <li> The bubble is not too much</li>
    <li> Pleasant taste, doesn&#x27;t burn, doesn&#x27;t gum up the tooth brush.  Beside that  my wife says it really works on the bad breath.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste ever!!</li>
    <li> I bought this toothpaste after reading about it online.  I used to get canker sores in my mouth and I haven&#x27;t had any since using this toothpaste.  It&#x27;s been several months.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t get that fresh minty taste like in other toothpastes. There may be other options out there, but this one worked for me!  I don&#x27;t travel without it!</li>
    <li> We started using this product with my then 10 year old son. He is on the autism spectrum (mild/Asperger&#x27;s) and I&#x27;ve read that kids on spectrum do have a bad breath problem that is biological. He was also getting teased at school for it and kids wouldn&#x27;t sit next to him even though we made sure he was brushing his teeth twice/day. I saw this product with the mouthwash at the grocery store one day and even though it was more expensive than I was used to paying for toothpaste/mouthwash, I decided we needed to try it. I am so happy to say that it WORKED!!! Now, the stores around us are not carrying the toothpaste and so I&#x27;m buying it at Amazon. For chronic bad breath sufferers and for parents of kids with this issue, definitely try this product--using BOTH the toothpaste/mouthwash together.</li>
    <li> After I used this toothpaste my bleeding gum stopped  and it is really help me lot to recover from the gum problems</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong...I am a big fan of the Therabreath products (although the only other I&#x27;ve tried is the mouth rinse). However, I think it is quite misleading that this product advertises a reduction in canker sores. Yes, it doesn&#x27;t use the harsh detergent known as Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, which is always good thing. Instead, they use a different detergent, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, which after my experience with this toothpaste, is just as bad as the former SLS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using Rembrant&#x27;s Canker Sore Sufferers toothpaste for months, and absolutely loved the stuff because I never got canker sores. I wanted to try the TheraBreath toothpaste after discovering the amazing mouth rinse, which I thought would work better in conjunction with this toothpaste than it would with my Rembrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big mistake on my part. After a day of using the TheraBreath I had already developed 3 canker sores (yes, three!). I figured it was merely a coincidence, or had to do with what I was eating, or maybe because I was brushing too hard. Nope, nope, and nope. Why? Because when I used the TB toothpaste it stung my sores like hell, just like all the SLS toothpastes I used in the past did. This only made the sores grow. Finally, I went back to the Rembrant. Although I had huge sores still, the Rembrant didn&#x27;t irritate or exacerbate the sores in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing a quick Google search, I found that Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate actually causes canker sores as well. I think in order for this to be a good product, you need to be the kind of person who never gets canker sores to begin with. It would be great if TheraBreath got rid of all detergents in their toothpastes...until then, I would highly recommend Rembrant for Canker Sore Sufferers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/7/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noted in the comments that since Rembrandt has inexplicably discontinued their miraculous toothpaste, I&#x27;ve been using Squigle. It definitely has prevented the canker sores, but I can&#x27;tsay that it is the most effective toothpaste hygienically. I feel like my teeth stain more easily, and the minty taste doesn&#x27;t stick as long. I still only use Squigle, but I&#x27;m longing for something like the Rembrandt to return. :(</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this at first. And when I got it, it came with literature that listed several other Dr. Katz products that were recommended for really getting rid of bad breath. So I thought that it was just a marketing tool. But I started using it twice a day, and it worked. My wife tells me that I no longer have bad breath. I&#x27;m pleased and amazed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years and it is terrific, but somebody needs to help them with their packaging.  All I want is a tube of toothpaste, not all the wasteful plastic and cardboard and promotions that I toss in the wastebasket.  It is really annoying.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect any of that Minty taste in your mouth after brushing. This  stuff just kills the odors and gets it over with. It leaves my mouth feeling actually clean, not just like my breath has been masked by some mint flavor.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recall anyone writing in their review that this toothpaste, while leaving you teeth feeling really clean, just doesn&#x27;t foam - at all.  If you&#x27;re used to feeling foam on your teeth, and you need that experience, don&#x27;t buy this one.  This looks like a gel but it basically coats your teeth and then you scrub and you get very little bubbling action.  I&#x27;m getting used to using it because I always associated foaming with clean.  So far though this does seem to work effectively.</li>
    <li> The toothpaste when you first start to brush with it has a mild baking soda taste to me.  Once I spit (sorry for the visual) and rinsed a slight hint of mint could be tasted.  My teeth felt clean and my mouth felt fresh.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This a  great toothpaste that helps with those that have halitosis. (Bad breath) It is something that is a toothpaste that I would not need. I will stick to Crest.</li>
    <li> Pricey but it works. Gluten free.</li>
    <li> Tastes good and if you follow exactly the instructions the toothpaste works very well eliminating bad breath.</li>
    <li> Bottom line: it works miraculously. I had cracked a molar while on travel, and over time, it turned into a horrible infection. To my chagrin, even though I resolved the infection my breath was not normal. I felt like every time I spoke to someone in the conference room I needed to crack a window.  I have spent hundreds of dollars on products, traditional and holistic experts to curtail what seemed to be chronic halitosis. Let alone popping in a new piece of gum on the hour, and was literally chewing my molar&#x27;s down. Within the first time I used the toothpaste, and mouthwash my breath was different.  I am convinced it worked the first application. I feel like I am back to normal, and don&#x27;t have a lingering stench in my office like I used too. Not only does it work, but it is also good for you</li>
    <li> This works better than scraping or brushing or regular mouthwash.  If you&#x27;re looking to eliminate bad breath, just cut to the chase and buy the TheraBreath products!</li>
    <li> Been using this for over 12 years and it continues to work well but I still prefer the original one we used to get.</li>
    <li> I use this toothpaste with a Philips Sonicare toothbrush.  I like the way it feels and tastes, but I do wish it was a bit mintier.  I like that there are no sulfates or harsh detergents.  I have very sensitive teeth and I used to use Sensodyne, but I was able to switch to TheraBreath without re-developing any sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this produce for a long and it is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blanche</li>
    <li> So far, I cannot distinguish what is different with this product compare to other cheaper toothpastes that are offered in grocery stores.  It has less flavor and less refreshing feeling compare to the other products.  I still do get bitter mouth after sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, this product is okay but I am not sure it worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It is supposed to be good since it kills sulfur-producing bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Less flavor, less refreshing feeling.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me &amp; you&#x27;ve always used conventional brand toothpaste like Crest, than the lack of of SLS will take a little getting used to since this paste won&#x27;t create the same sudsing effect.  However, once you get used to that, you realize that you aren&#x27;t really missing anything w/ the SLS.  It really does work in combating bad breath as well, we tried it for my son &amp; it worked when no other toothpaste, mouthwash or breath mints had.</li>
    <li> I like the oxygen flavor, it is not abrasive. Once you use it for a while you don&#x27;t want to come back to the other common brands.  It is, however, extremely expensive. It is about 5 to 6 times more expensive than the regular ones. Each sachet is only 4 Oz.</li>
    <li> Use the effect is not very good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using TheraBreath Toothpaste for over 7 years, but lately the toothpaste is not very effective.  I used to have very fresh breath just after using it but now it doesn&#x27;t feel that way anymore.  I believe it&#x27;s something to do with the change of formula.  The consistency of the paste used to be thick and now it&#x27;s runny.  The change in the consistency was probably done because the toothpaste used to dry out too fast, so much so that you could feel hard areas inside the tube before I had a chance to use up the entire tube.  Drying out too fast no longer happens but now the toothpaste is not very effective.  Too bad!  I may stop using this and start looking for an alternative.  Any suggestions?  UPDATE:  I did a search online for alternatives and came up with CloSYS.  It got overall higher ratings than Therabreath Toothpaste.  I ordered it and it&#x27;s arriving tomorrow.</li>
    <li> My husband love it so much！It is very useful！</li>
    <li> It works. Plain and simple.  Dr. Katz has done his research and create a product that has made a huge difference in people who has suffered lifelong hilatotis.  He has done where no big companies such as Colgate, Crest or Sensodyn could.  It&#x27;s shameful that with their vast amounts of research and development, they couldn&#x27;t come up with an effective toothpaste or mouth rinse to combat bad breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that Therabreath products can be found in various local retailers, I do hope the prices of various TheraBreath will decrease and be more competitive as well as affordable so more people can use them.  Here&#x27;s hoping to find 4oz TheraBreath toothpaste and 16oz TheraBreath Oral Rinse for about $4 each by 2015!</li>
    <li> The formulation of this toothpaste is based on the premise that we should not expose our gums to the detergents present in typical toothpastes.  I think this paste cleans well, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m buying the notion that detergents irritate gums.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both hated it.  Did not leave a clean feeling.  I was fooled by the reviews!</li>
    <li> I usually have pretty fresh breath but, for about a year now that has changed. When I talk to people I always notice they cover up their nose with their hand.I have even had close people to me tell me my breath stinks and even a ex boyfriend and, it very embarrassing! I started talking to people with my head down, or when I talk I would barley open my mouth hoping the smell doesnt come out, or I would chew gum back to back to back or use halls(only because the smell was really strong so it helped). One day I said this has got to stop!! I started off by cleaning my tongue (which I never did) and it seemed like it worked until I smelled my own breath one day while I was in the car by myself. So, next I noticed how dry my mouth was and figured the bad breath was from my dry mouth so I started using biotene mouthwash which did help my dryness but the bad breath was still there. I went and got a cleaning at the denist which was free w/my insurance but that still didn&#x27;t work. It was like even RIGHT after burshing my teeth my breath would STINK. So I stumbled across Therabreath one day and thought this product has got to be like any other product but, I was willing to give anything a try at this point. I got the toothpaste,mouthwash, and mints. AWESOMENESS!!!!!!!!!! It was almost liked it work that very day. Only con I have is the taste of the toothpaste but, if it cures my bad breath WHO CARES!!! This is a great product I am over joyed I found something to help my bad breath!</li>
    <li> I like that it does not contain sodium lauryl sulfate which is hard to find in a toothpaste. It&#x27;s also nice when people don&#x27;t turn their head away from you when you speak due to bad breath. Yes it is expensive but Amazon has the best price I have found.</li>
    <li> Product is okay. Nothing special like other reviews claim, they must work for the company or own stocks in it.</li>
    <li> it works. I love it. It leaves your teeth felling so smooth and clean. If you have bad breath get this product. Come back my confidence.</li>
    <li> OMG that tooth paste really works . It fights bad breath&lt;br /&gt;Dr Katz Thera breath is the best tooth paste</li>
    <li> Dr. Katz has nailed it!  After struggling with bad breath for many years, TheraBreath is like a prayer answered.  No more terrible morning breath!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t taste like regular toothpaste but the wife no longer complain about bad breath.  Expensive compare to regular toothpaste but worth the extra dollars.</li>
    <li> Taste of toothpaste is very important to me and this is not so good. It becomes very thin and messy in your mouth as you brush. Very little lather, as you are used to when using most other tooth pastes.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever found that does not irritate my mouth.  It&#x27;s soothing when I have cancer soars, and I think it actually helps prevent them because there is no irritation on the soft tissues of my mouth when I use TheraBreath.</li>
    <li> I discovered Dr. Katz TheraBreath mouthwash about 5 years ago. It worked ok, but when I combined it with this toothpaste, the bad breath I&#x27;ve been combating completely disappeared. I don&#x27;t follow the directions to the letter. I do brush first (i try to get some on my tongue, but I don&#x27;t necessarily scrape it on per the directions), then floss, then rinse. I sometimes rinse at night and I have zero bad breath in the morning (and my mouth is never dry when I do this). If I skip the rinse at night, I sometimes notice that stale taste in the morning. But a morning brush/rinse and I&#x27;m set for the day! This is an amazing product. I&#x27;ve tried several - Listerine, Tom&#x27;s, Rembrandt, BreathRx, SmartMouth. Only the SmartMouth works as well, but that leaves a harsh, almost gritty, aftertaste, while TheraBreath has a very mild flavor, and no real aftertaste (even orange juice tastes normal right after brushing).</li>
    <li> I bought this item because it said It would help fight bad breath. It doesn&#x27;t. Aquafresh extreme clean is way better helping fight mouth odor. However, when I returned the product I received great customer service from Dr.Katz&#x27;s office. I hope this review helps!!</li>
    <li> Product was great. Shipping was fast. Product really works.</li>
    <li> In conjunction with a toungue scraper and Dr. Katz&#x27;s mouthwash, this toothpaste makes my bad breath disappear. I&#x27;ve suffered from bad breath for a long time but my new regimen w/ Dr. Katz&#x27;s products really works at fighting bad breath - and it does last an entire day.</li>
    <li> Works great for my son!!!! Regular toothpaste did not help. Even Listerine made it worse.Therabreath products actually do what they say!</li>
    <li> Not a terribly good tasting toothpaste....didn&#x27;t really do much for me...and worst of all, never really had that &#x27; really clean&#x27; just brushed feeling.</li>
    <li> I like using this product. I use the toothpaste and mouth rinse. It has a mild minty taste. I don&#x27;t have dragon breath in the morning and lasts throughout the day.</li>
    <li> The toothpaste with the feel good, mouth feeling really fresh. I will buy again.Oral cavity ulcer did not come to have a look, can be used for a long time, what change about the teeth.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a fake / knock-off product, but this one tastes totally different. It tastes like a tube of sugar mint and doesn&#x27;t even froth up like the old one. This has to be either a fake knock-off or Therabreath changed their product pretty drastically. It was really bad to the point that I need to throw it away. I&#x27;ve been using Therabreath for over a year and have been happy with it up until now.</li>
    <li> I can not find a better mouth wash. I started using it because I was fed up with harsh alcohol products.</li>
    <li> Great product. love it.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  The toothpaste really cleans teeth.  Since using it my dentist asked what I was using.  I had no cavities.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste works very well. It is worth the price that you will pay for it.</li>
    <li> This and their Mouthwash solved bad breath issues</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is like water soluble gel.  Completely disintegrates the minute you put it in your mouth.  You may as well be brushing with just a wet toothbrush.  As far as breath freshening, please!  You can&#x27;t freshen breath with barely a hint of mint.  This was practically the equivalent of a quarter of a tic tac to freshen breath.  Never felt like my teeth and mouth were being cleaned.  If dentists are recommending this, then I&#x27;d really like to meet these quacks because they obviously haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
    <li> You should use it this toothpaste and the TheraBreath Oral Rinse.  It really kills bad breath almost instantly! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Totally cured my breath issue!</li>
    <li> This products is truly a life saver and breathesteem booster. I&#x27;ve tried many products that did not give me the confidence on fresh breathe with lip smacking results. If you desire the effectiveness of the same I suggest you use with their other products.</li>
    <li> I have been using Biotene for years but they changed their formula.  The new Biotene bothered me so I tried the TheraBreath and it is working great.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday, useful and comfortable!</li>
    <li> …my fav toothpaste…no fluoride brands allowed in my cabinet…the matching mouthwash gives long lasting fresh mouth…next time will try perio...</li>
    <li> Using this toothpaste has changed my life.  I use it in conjunction with mouthwash and it is definitely worth buying.  It doesn&#x27;t have the artificial crap that other pastes have and it leaves your mouth clean and fresh.  The taste is subtle and pleasing with no bad after taste 5 minutes after you brush like most pastes seem to do.</li>
    <li> Have been using this toothpaste for a few years now. I no longer get repeatedly asked by my significant other, &amp;#34;Did you brush your teeth today?&amp;#34;, so it&#x27;s definitely working. I use this in conjunction with the TheraBreath Fresh Breath Oral Rinse. Definitely a strange experience going from normal toothpaste to this kind, but I am used to it now and find normal toothpaste weird. When I use normal toothpaste, I often forget to rinse the remnants from my mouth I am so used to this! (As per the directions, you should spit but not rinse the toothpaste out. It interacts with the oral rinse).</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a very short time along with the rinse and tongue cleaner. It is different as it does not foam like most toothpaste and leaves a little salty taste initially.  From what I had researched an ingredient that they put in toothpaste making them foam up apparently they say is not a good ingredient (?)  Never knew that before.  I did take the toothpaste to show my dentist and she did like the ingredients that this one has.  After using all 3 items, I am noticing a good difference in my breath but not overnight.  I have a feeling it takes a while to get impressive results.  Also I have not been faithful in gargling with it which they do tell you to do with the rinse.  So it most likely works the best when you follow the directions.  I do admit that after trying multiple toothpastes these products were the first to make my breath better!</li>
    <li> Really helps with dry mouth.</li>
    <li> This is the MOST vile toothpaste I have ever tried.  EVER.  It tastes exactly the way those pucks one finds sitting in the bottom of a urinal smells.  There&#x27;s no foaming action and it coats the mouth with a really weird feel.  Each time I&#x27;ve used this (totally as directed) I end up feeling like I have a big ol loogie sitting at the back of my throat.  The mouthwash is really wonderful but this stuff is NASSSSTY.  Skip it.  I use Tom&#x27;s of Maine with the mouthwash.  Oh, the mints are really nasty too.</li>
    <li> I have never had halitosis, but I am a coffee drinker and no matter what toothpaste or mouthwash I used or how hard I brushed, I would always wake up with dragon breath. Not cute at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I stumbled upon this product while searching for something else and read a few of the reviews, and figured why the heck not. It wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this product comes in a two-pack, the price is good for what you get in my opinion. The toothpaste itself has a slight minty taste to it, VERY slight. The instructions that came with the box were extremely helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say that to smell your breath you shouldn&#x27;t cup your hand and breathe into it like most people do. Dr. Katz recommends that you lick the back of your hand and let it dry and then smell it to get an idea of how your breath smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said I woke up the morning after using this product and the mouthwash for the first time, tried the above technique, and was extremely surprised that my breath didn&#x27;t smell at all. It was completely neutral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had bad taste/breath problems for a couple of years.  I had tried a variety of things that dentists recommended: flossing, scraping my tongue, avoiding certain foods/drinks, drinking lots of water, chewing sugar-free gum...I think each thing had a very small effect, but generally I was forced to chew gum constantly to mask the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste and the oral rinse together immediately fixed the issue.  I only use it in the morning before heading out, as it is more expensive than big brand toothpastes, but even the once a day application leaves my mouth feeling completely fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave a little aftertaste for some time after, but guess what--EVERY toothpaste does!  Go use any random toothpaste and drink a glass of orange juice right after and tell me there&#x27;s no weird flavors there.  The aftertaste lasts the same length of time as regular toothpaste&#x27;s aftertaste, and it&#x27;s no more unpleasant.  The advantage is that this stuff actually keeps your breath smelling good WAY after the regular toothpaste \\&quot;wears off\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to get my teeth quite as smooth.  I have a top of the line electric brush with a built-in timer and all that and I notice I have to spend a little more time getting everything clean with TheraBreath.  It might be that regular toothpaste has more abrasives that help break up plaque more.  This is why I still use my regular kind before sleeping, when I&#x27;m not really concerned about my breath.  I took off one star because removing plaque is still really important, and this causes a little inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this toothpaste did what I wanted, and I&#x27;ll continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Keeps my mouth fresh and clean all day.</li>
    <li> first time using this product, it really does solve the dry mouth and i feel my breath is not bad or good but neutral, i am very curious to see the long-term effects.</li>
    <li> This product is incredibly effective in cleaning the white layer that forms on my tongue. Cannot comment on its effect on my teeth, though. I only brush my tongue with this toothpaste, and use another for my teeth.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. I found out in less than a minute after useing this stuff and a trip to the ER that I can&#x27;t  use aloe vera.</li>
    <li> I noticed it when my dentist told me that my dentine feels noticeably softer after at a regular check up.  It also works for about 2 hours that&#x27;s it.  I&#x27;d say go with something else.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste in conjunction with the mouthwash is a miracle, highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price on Amazon is a lot less than at the local drug store!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing you have to get used to, or at least I did, this doesn&#x27;t foam up like your normal Crest or Aquafresh,,,,,but it works!</li>
    <li> leaves lips chalky even after rinsing face, so double the after rinse time to clear it up.  bothersome, but love the no-mint-just-clean taste it leaves</li>
    <li> This 2 pack toothpaste is awesome it also comes with mouthwash and mint. Best thing for someone with dry mouth</li>
    <li> no flavor or taste to this product at all. doesnt help with bad breath its a waste of time and effort. now i have 2 tubes going to waste</li>
    <li> Ok, Ok I know I might have exaggerated a little on the title but let me tell you, this stuff really DOES WORK. I&#x27;ve been married for 16yrs. and around 8 years ago for some unknown reason I started to develop bad breath(yuck) and this started to affect my relationship with my wife. I noticed she would not kiss me as often and would usually turn away when I tried to get face to face close up with her. I thought she was being cold and insensitive but when she broke down to tell me the true reason why she would avoid kissing me because of my bad breath I was a little hurt but mostly upset at myself because of this nasty breath problem. I couldn&#x27;t blame her I wouldn&#x27;t want to kiss me either if I would have known how bad my breath was. She said it was so bad that I would stink up our bedroom and it got to the point where my own kids where afraid to come near me!! I was desperate and determined to cure this horrible problem so I tried everything! I went to the dentist and got a $300 \\&quot;Deep cleaning\\&quot; but that didn&#x27;t work, I tried numerous so called \\&quot;Bad breath eliminator products\\&quot; they didn&#x27;t work. I tried the Pro Fresh program and that was ok but it was too expensive and it left a bleachy taste in your mouth. I tried home made remedies, but nope, nada! I gargled vinegar, peroxide, and was almost willing to gargle bleach!! but NOTHING seemed to work. Until about a month ago I happened to be strolling down the toothpaste aisle at Walmart and noticed this weird looking green bottle that had claims of \\&quot;eliminating bad breath\\&quot; I thought to myself ,\\&quot;Ya right, just like everyone else\\&quot; but as I read the label I was intrigued by the \\&quot;Guaranteed\\&quot; claim they had and also because these are natural ingredients. So I thought,\\&quot;Oh well I should try this, what do I have to lose any way a few bucks and my bad breath?\\&quot; and let me tell you, to my amazement after just using this in one day my wife noticed a difference, boy was I happy! after two days I no longer had bad breath!! since then I have been using this daily, it is easy and effective to use, but most of all I have my wife back, lol. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO SUFFERS FROM BAD BREATH, trust me or my wife and maybe my kids this stuff REALLY DOES WORK!! I only wish they would have come out with this product sooner so I wouldn&#x27;t have to make my family suffer, or co workers or anyone else! THERABREATH I WILL BE A LIFE LONG USER, YOU SAVED MY MARRIAGE. I can now give my beautiful wife a BIG FAT JUICY KISS without her turning away. She told me the other day while we were cuddling, \\&quot; Honey, I am so glad I can kiss you again I sure missed kissing you\\&quot; That there is enough reason to give this product 5 stars, heck I would give it 10 stars if I could!!!........P.S. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you purchase the Oral Rinse to compliment this toothpaste. TRUST ME ( AN EX-BAD BREATHER..LOL) YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT, THIS WILL BE THE BEST INVESTMENT YOU EVER MADE!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely Putrid taste, but mostly effective. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 10 years, and I haven&#x27;t found a replacement for it, but I&#x27;d happily give it up if I could.  It&#x27;s utterly impossible for me to brush two minutes without gagging. I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t make it taste better, or why they don&#x27;t put a little flavor in it. They brag that a minty taste &amp;#34;covers up&amp;#34;, which is why TheraBreath isn&#x27;t minty or fresh tasting.  Still,  it would be nice if my mouth tasted better after brushing, like it does with regular toothpaste. When I need it to taste better, I often put a couple of drops of &amp;#34;Ora Wellness healthy mouth blend&amp;#34;  essential oils on the toothbrush along with this toothpaste. Makes it palatable.  I use this twice a day, before work, and before bed, but still use regular toothpaste,  for when I need a clean taste, like first thing in the morning, or after lunch.</li>
    <li> Husband&#x27;s breath smelled like death or poo for years. After many others brands and dental visits, nothing helped. This helped in a few weeks! Along with using the mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also makes my teeth feel cleaner all day and less sensitive!</li>
    <li> Dr. Katz&#x27;s toothpaste is not cheap, but it really fights bad breath and dry mouth. Blah blah blah blah blah</li>
    <li> No mouth sores, sensitive teeth or bad breath after using TheraBreath. I am back to purchase more!</li>
    <li> the paste it self could use a little more substaints to it, act and feels more like a gel-mouth wash a very soft tooth paste however still effective as a toothpaste but  follow up with the lozenges and you will love your mouth</li>
    <li> My teeth feel cleaner than when I used biotene!</li>
    <li> Great product, great taste, works advertised.  I use in conjunction with lozenges and mouth wash.  I am on two prescription drugs that dry my mouth out and it has been a constant battle.  Will reorder!</li>
    <li> If you want your breath to not stink ALL day, get this and the oral rinse! Even if you eat onions or something, your breath doesn&#x27;t smell horrible! I love this stuff! It is really great for those long days you know you&#x27;re not going to be home and be able to brush after lunch. Honestly I do not use this everyday, because I&#x27;m not sure how effective it is against cavities, but I more so reserve it for those long days!</li>
    <li> Maybe i don&#x27;t use it rignt,have no bubble?And i think it don&#x27;t clean the tooth.I want to read  the instructions carefully.</li>
    <li> This arrived in good time and is as described.  I haven&#x27;t noticed that my breath is any fresher or moister.  I have braces, and I have trouble with sores in my mouth at times.  I was hoping it would help with those, but it has not.  I wouldn&#x27;t order again</li>
    <li> I am writing this review as someone who gets tonsil stones, tonsiloths, if you get them you know what I am talking about. This and the whole line of therabreath did not help prevent my tonsil stones. I used the oral rinse, the toothpaste, and the throat spray. If you suffer from this read on because I will tell you what did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the above being said, this did work for general bad breathe. The gross white film on my tongue disappeared, and I dipped my floss into this before flossing to get rid of the smell between my teeth. I could tell there was a smell there because when I flossed I could smell it.&lt;br /&gt;The method I used was&lt;br /&gt;1. prerinse&lt;br /&gt;2. floss&lt;br /&gt;3.tongue scrape&lt;br /&gt;4. brush teeth&lt;br /&gt;5.post rinse&lt;br /&gt;6. throat spray&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you suffering from tonsil stones I am going to provide you to my reviews of two products that did work to significantly reduce the amount of tonsil stones I get. Please read my reviews as I discuss how I use them. I do not know why this helped to prevent my tonsil stones but I do know that I went from getting them several times a week to a few times a year. I don&#x27;t discuss my tonsil problems in my review of the ear oil but I do believe that the ear oil and peroxide in the ears provided a huge impact on my tonsil health. (I started thinking there was a relation because when I would clean my ears with a wet q tip and smell it, it had a similar smell to tonsil stones, not nearly as bad, but something similar to it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/review/R26OSUEX71PB1X/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B0001TNCK0&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HAYQERRJ10XQ/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B001E11CPQ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a tonsil stone sufferer and this helped you please vote it up so I can help others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comment if you have any questions at all, I would be happy to respond and answer any questions you have.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked on therabreath products. They&#x27;re light and almost tasteless, yet they neutralize bad breath so well. I use the toothpaste with the mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Helps breath but doesn&#x27;t clean teeth well even with my sonicare</li>
    <li> It is good, however If used alone without the rinse it does&#x27;nt do much.</li>
    <li> No extra foam, and no irritating odor, mouth after brushing their teeth is very refreshing, adding mouthwash for bad breath and dry mouth have a good role, I will stick with it, because it allowed me to see results</li>
    <li> From put of nowhere my wife informed me that it smelled like something died in my mouth. This took me by surprise because I brush twice a day and floss every night. The smell came on quickly and would not go away, I don&#x27;t know what brought it on. I began using Listerine but that did not help and from what they say at therabreath, it may have made matters worse. I got the mouthwash, toothpaste and breath mints on Monday and began using them right away as directed (brush, mouthwash, floss and mouthwash again) twice a day. Last night (Wednesday) I asked the wife about my breath...she said it smelled fine. I went from constant detectable odor from 4-5 feet away to no odor even when close up in three days. It may have even worked faster but I never asked if my breath smelled until Wednesday and considering that she does not hesitate to tell me if it does smell I believe that it did work faster. It leaves your teeth felling so smooth and clean. If you have bad breath get this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the TheraBreath Toothpaste and Mouth wash along with Tonsil Stone kit for over 2 months now. It has not helped me. Maybe it has helped me improve my breath NOT SURE!!! it is difficult to say. At this point of time I&#x27;m planning to use these products for few more months before making a decision to use or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons&lt;br /&gt;Very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have discontinued using Therabreath products. I have tried their Toothpaste and Mouthwash products for over an year and found no improvements. Just waste of money.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using this product. I dont think I noticed any difference. maybe it was not the right product for me. But I think going to the dentist fixed it.</li>
    <li> Good item, TheraBreath products are good.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is amazing. It really gives you long lasting fresh breathe. You will literally go to sleep and wake up with fresh breathe. I&#x27;ve been sold on this toothpaste and mouthwash from the very first use. Morning breathe is no longer an issue since I stated using therabreathe products.</li>
    <li> Dr. Katz products are the only products we&#x27;ve ever found that really work for chronic bad breath! Toothpaste &amp; mouthwash work.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this. It&#x27;s a wonderful thing to never at any time of the day or night, no matter what you ate, to have bad breath. Moistens your mouth, too, helping avoid tooth and gum disease. I&#x27;ve recommended it to skeptics before and now they&#x27;re firm believers, too!</li>
    <li> Therabreath is the best!</li>
    <li> Pricey compare with the other over the counter toothpaste but worth the money that my family would like to used as well! Oxygenating solution seems to work to prevent dry mouth.</li>
    <li> This is the best! I love it and I am a happy customer!</li>
    <li> Terrible allergic reaction on lips.....many blisters, dry,swollen,super red and inflamed....had to go to my dermatologist for diagnosis and treatment. Very frustrated as reaction just kept getting worse. I would not recommend this to my worst enemy. It has to have some very harsh ingrediants in it to do what it did to me and who wants that in a toothpaste? STAY AWAY! I use Trader Joes toothpaste,with no SLS ....very inexpensive and absolutely no canker sores or reactions whatsoever.</li>
    <li> My favorite! Wish it was sold in more stores.</li>
    <li> Unique product that I highly recommend - the toothpaste and mouthwash have to be used together. The approach uses chemistry to remove sulfur/sulfides from mouth and tongue that cause bad breadth.</li>
    <li> Works well. Not used to not having bubbles like regular toothpaste though</li>
    <li> Bad breath eliminator! Great product to go along with the TheraBreath mouth wash and Lozenges! Remove bad breath immediately. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I started using this toothpaste last year when my wife told me that I needed to do something about my bad breath. Using this toothpaste and the oral rinse does the job.  I highly recommend the products.  It may cost a little more but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothpaste for over a year now. I tried going back to the standard toothpastes sold in-store, and they just taste like chemicals and made me gag. Does the toothpaste work as advertised? I never really noticed a difference in the freshness of my breath, or the reduction in dry mouth, but it is a very healthy replacement for the name brand toothpastes.</li>
    <li> A blessing straight from Heaven. I have used numerous mouth wash but only this product could stop my embarrassing bad breath.  I can now whisper in my wife&#x27;s ears without worrying about her  frowned face</li>
    <li> Works GREAT to take care of bad breath.  When used regularly, and especially in conjunction with the Therabreath Oral Rinse, the bad breath is GONE!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I stumbled upon this line of products after I had a cold that left a bad taste/smell in my mouth.  This toothpaste and the mouthwash completely eradicated that bad breath.  Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I first tried the toothpaste last year and have found that it really does eliminate bad breath. I&#x27;m impressed at how effective the product is and would gladly recommend it to others. I would give it a 5 star rating if the toothpaste had a &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; effect to it. In my opinion that would make this product perfect.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t foam up, tastes disgusting. It didn&#x27;t do what it was supposed to do. I wouldn&#x27;t use it again. Might work for someone else.</li>
    <li> I love it ,it is very gentle and economical ( you don&#x27;t need to much),and the result is amazing with the use of oral rinse together&lt;br /&gt;  great</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I pair it with the mouthwash from the same company.  Completely eradicates bad breath.  I had pretty bad breath that made me self conscious.  This really neutralizes bad breath.  It does not taste minty or anything, kind of bland tasting, but the odor is gone.  I buy this regularly now, it is my only toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Noticed difference immediately!</li>
    <li> I get nothing but compliments when I have my teeth cleaned.</li>
    <li> Mouth is still fresh and not dry and takes care of morning breath. However, it is not as foamy as the usual toothpaste we are normally used to while brushing. It feels like you are using salt as a toothpaste. I don&#x27;t like the texture but it is effective for bad breath.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste for sensitive teeth and mouth. It doesn&#x27;t clean as well as I thought it would, so I alternate with another toothpaste once a week. However, I notice less irritation and makes breath smell great!</li>
    <li> I always have these in my pocket so I don&#x27;t victimize the innocent with airplane breath,  snack breath,  church breath, and so on. They work cuz I give them to friends!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says it will do. Noticed a vast improvement of dry mouth (from medication) after FIRST use! Expensive, but it has worked for me.</li>
    <li> Great for dental hygiene. SLS free.</li>
    <li> Not very good. Does not produce sufficient foaming so it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re brushing properly. Very pricey too, Biotene is much better.</li>
    <li> Absolutely disgusting. The flavor and texture make me vomit.</li>
    <li> Very fresh, leaves a very clean sensation</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying this product saved my life and I&#x27;m not exaggerating either! I&#x27;ve been a lifetime bad breath sufferer and have tried EVERYTHING! I thought it was a lost cause. I actually thought the bad breath was coming from my digestive system. I&#x27;m still in disbelief this product have worked and worked 100% for me! I use this together with TheraBreath Oral Rinse and after the very first use, NO MORE BAD BREATH!! I couldn&#x27;t believe it and still surprised!&lt;br /&gt;I also started taking Now Foods Oralbiotic Blis K12 when I started the Therebreath toothpaste and rinse but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the Therabreath products that did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, if you have suffered from bad breath and nothing have ever worked, trust me, if it worked for me, it will work for you!! I can&#x27;t describe how much these Therabreath products have changed my life!!</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste.  Worked for me.  Pleasant taste.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful toothpaste for those of us who suffer from dry mouth.  I like the losanges too.  I plan to order the mouthwash next.</li>
    <li> Does what it says effectively. Really happy that I decided to order this after reading so many reviews of other consumers. Just feel it is a bit expensive for the quantity. Me and my husband both use it and 2 mouth rinse bottles lasted 15-20 days. But we are re-ordering because we are satisfied with it!</li>
    <li> Dr. Katz&#x27;s breath treatment was recommended by my dentist.  I was astounded by the results; but, I am sure you must follow their recommendations.&lt;br /&gt;I have been impressed with their products; however, a little bit pricey......</li>
    <li> If you know someone who has a breath problem and nothing works: this is your product.  It is the best!</li>
    <li> I can not believe how this product help me. I love coffee and I have some false tooth, that combination is infallible for bad breath. With this toothpaste plus the rinse my breath is nice, I feel more confident. My next purchase was on bed bath and beyond with 20% off coupon... :)</li>
    <li> Seems to be pretty effective at preventing or greatly reducing morning breath.  I wish it had a more robust flavor or maybe a cinnamon variety.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this works or not, but it does give me a fresher feeling in my mouth. I also bought the mouthwash, which I definitely feel a change in oral breath.</li>
    <li> This product works well but is unpleasant to use for me. I love this line because it eliminates tonsil stones.  I&#x27;m very loyal. But the stuff comes out like a clear ointment and not a paste and EVERYTIME I have to stick in my mouth I flinch. The fact that I am using it at All gives good testimony to the loyalty I have to this product line and brand.</li>
    <li> Thank you TheraBreath. I bought this for my husband. Now I can kiss him again!</li>
    <li> I am now on my second tube of toothpaste and third bottle of mouthwash.  It works great, not only for my breath but also for my gums and my teeth seem whiter.</li>
    <li> I was having &amp;#34;burning mouth syndrome&amp;#34; and with using the toothpaste 2x daily, using a salve on my lips and watching what I ate, managing stress, I am much improved.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had any issues with bad breath, but I recently underwent chemotherapy and found that my mouth felt really disgusting during treatment.  I didn&#x27;t have thrush, but I had a nasty white coating on my tongue that my usual diligent dental care did not budge.  I heard of TheraBreath as being helpful for dry mouth, so I thought I&#x27;d try it.  I use both the toothpaste and the dental rinse in Mild Mint (the green bottle), and they are excellent.  I much prefer that there isn&#x27;t a strong, minty taste (it&#x27;s kind of watery over minty), as chemotherapy does odd things to your taste buds.  Regular toothpaste was triggering some nausea for me, so this is perfect for me.  My teeth look and feel great (they seem whiter than ever), and no more dry mouth/nasty white coating on my tongue.  I am very careful to not get the toothpaste or dental rinse on my lips, as the corners of my mouth do get really dry and even small splits in them if I do.  I rinse my mouth and face carefully and apply lip balm after use, which prevents this.  I really think this is the best toothpaste ever for me, as I don&#x27;t love a strong taste or a burning sensation in my mouth.</li>
    <li> I had no idea what tonsil stones were until I ran across the reviews for this toothpaste.  I had been having an issue with feeling like there was something in the back of my throat, so I googled tonsil stones &amp; was horrified at some of the pics.  I took out my purse size flash light &amp; a mirror &amp; sure enough there were 2 little white dots on my tonsil.  They were barely there, but my throat knew they existed.  I ordered this stuff, along with the mouthwash, immediately.  Within a day or so of use, they were gone...like magic!  It was hard to get used to the very subtle taste of this product...most mouthwashes are very strong, but that doesn&#x27;t mean its not working.  It is more expensive than any other brand I have tried before, but well worth it.  My mouth feels great!</li>
    <li> eh..... didn&#x27;t really make my breath as fresh or clean as I had hoped</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first- it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; like it&#x27;s working as you brush your teeth, but it has completely taken care of bad breath related to eating foods that cause a sulfur smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen all the hype on the product and decided to give it a try since I&#x27;ve been getting tonsil stones really bad and battling with the odor that comes along with it and I found that regular toothpaste does nothing at all--in fact in makes it worse. Therabreath toothpaste is good in that doesn&#x27;t have all the abrasive qualities of other toothpastes and isn&#x27;t sugary. I noticed that the toothpaste neutralized my mouth. That is to say that my mouth felt rather clean and wasn&#x27;t stick. I do wish, however, that there was some kind of minty-ness to the product. The neutralized mouth thing doesn&#x27;t last that long though. This toothpaste does not help with tonsil stones. I don&#x27;t even think it&#x27;s meant to unless coupled with a multitude of other products, which is frustrating. It seems that this toothpaste used alone is pretty good but when used with the mouthwash my taste gets messed up. I like the toothpaste enough to continue using it until I find something better.</li>
    <li> This USED to be a good product.  Unfortunately around 1.5 years ago, the formula was changed and it is now mostly snake oil.  The old product came in blue and white packaging, the new product is in green packaging - the new formula has much less of the active ingredient (oxyd8) than the old one.....I think this formula has it as the 10th ingredient while the old formula had it as the 4th.  Hopefully these guys will revive the old product again, until then AVOID.</li>
    <li> This product is great. Had problems with bad breath for years. Definitely use with the oral rinse. Don&#x27;t even get morning breath anymore. Take my word. Its a life saver!!!!</li>
    <li> Finally my tonsil stones have gone away. I encourage using twice a day as when I have forgotten and only done once my tonsils bother me again. The mouthwash after using toothpaste is a must. I try to gargle for 2-4 minutes twice a day. Life savor and now I rarely even get morning breath.</li>
    <li> I bought it together with Dr. Katz TheraBreath mouth linse. For me, mouse linse is much better and effective than the Toothpaste. But still it is good product and I am happy using it.</li>
    <li> Someone had the courage to tell me about my breath. I tried Dr. Katz products and had immediate and long lasting results.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste really works.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several years.  It is great!  Doesn&#x27;t have a strong flavor and I use it with the mouthwash as well.  Does the trick.</li>
    <li> Ulcers (mouth sores) have unfortunately been a huge part of my life. They are absolutely NO fun. After a month-long bout of one breakout after another, I started researching ways to reduce them. Turns out some people are sensitive to the sulfate in most toothpastes. So, I looked for other toothpastes....a lot of the so-called natural toothpastes taste horrible so I was glad I found this one. It isn&#x27;t as strong or minty as regular toothpaste and it doesn&#x27;t get as sudsy as regular toothpaste, but it helps my teeth feel clean longer than regular toothpaste (most days, by dinner time my teeth feel &#x27;furry&#x27;???) and it helps get rid of the dry mouth taste from my allergy medicine. My daughter struggles with tonsil stones and TERRIBLE breath....(I am serious, it is AWFUL) and when she uses this toothpaste as she is supposed to, along with the mouthwash it gets rid of her bad breath!!! I keep it in stock now, and rarely ever get mouth ulcers. My husband still hates it and thinks it taste horrible, so we always have two toothpastes -- If you need something for breath or sensitivity to sulfates, it is worth the &#x27;different&#x27; taste!!</li>
    <li> Does what it says, provides great mouth health for your teeth and gums. I plan to keep on using these products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and no one has accused me of having bad breath since then. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Waste of money. No taste to this. My mouth didn&#x27;t feel clean when done brushing with this.</li>
    <li> I use this toothpaste with mouthwash by Dr. Katz as well. I can feel the cleanliness of my mouth afterwords for hours.</li>
    <li> Had problems with bad breath my entire life.  These products changed all that.  I can confidently talk to people up close and not worry anymore, even after eating onions.  I would recommend using the mouthwash after brushing with the TheraBreath toothpaste,  These two together kill bad breath everytime.  LOVE this product! Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Never leave the house with funkbreath. This product works!</li>
    <li> Good product.  It really helps!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for about three months now and I feel it has helped.  My dentist even said to keep doing whatever I was doing because he has seen a big change in my gum disease,so I showed him this toothpaste,  he said he couldn&#x27;t say it was what&#x27;s helping however he couldn&#x27;t say that it wasn&#x27;t the toothpaste, but he did say if I feel it&#x27;s working then continue using it.  my gum disease isn&#x27;t as bad as it was in the past so I have to give this product an excellent rating.</li>
    <li> This leaves my teeth feeling very clean. It is almost neutral in flavor to me. Make sure to read how to use it...no water for best results. I am very impressed with this line..worth the cost to me.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done, but leaves a funny taste on mouth (not the reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars). It&#x27;s way too expensive.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste has been great it does wonders for your breath there&#x27;s nothing else like it out there so if you need to control bad breath this is the 1 to buy .</li>
    <li> This stuff is weird. I wish it foamed. It cleans well but doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s in your mouth so. i always use a ton more than I would with regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a number of years and it is the best. It will remove the bad breath that was so embarrassing. Plus use the mouthwash to complete the cleaning.  I was very pleased to find that I could order it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> A new kind of product with amazing results, worth everybody&#x27;s time and money.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t really help with the bad breathe as they say.  Better luck with cheaper toothpaste to have fresh breathe.  Didn&#x27;t help with dry mouth either.</li>
    <li> Becomes very runny as your brushing and runs down your chin into the sink. Is not thick enough to cling to anything. There is a lot of waste  for a fairly expensive product.</li>
    <li> It was a waste of money, sorry for me, plus they don&#x27;t take it back, even the one that is sealed from the manufactured.</li>
    <li> I definitely noticed a change. My gums tend to bleed a little with regular toothpaste but whenever I use this it never ever bleeds. Also I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong flavor.</li>
    <li> A give this product a bad review basically because besides the fact that it didn&#x27;t work for me at all, the brochure that is included with the toothpaste states that the main reason you have bad breath is because of the volatile sulphur compounds in your mouth.Furthermore, It clearly states that you can&#x27;t have any bad breath due to problems in your digestive system. well, they are wrong, you can get bad breath from plenty of different medical conditions such as GERD, food allergies, tonsillitis, candidiasis, liver issues etc.&lt;br /&gt;If this product works for you beware that while it may help get rid of the bad smell on your mouth it may actually just temparly &amp;#34;hide&amp;#34; any underlying medical condition you may not be aware of.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent toothpaste for controlling bad breath. I&#x27;m very satisfied with it after two years of use. Recommended.</li>
    <li> At first it seems not to freshen the breath esp if you used to using those menthol tooth pastes but trust me it works!! If nothing works for you this surely will!!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, good service quality first-class Meiya, commodity。With the long time feel good</li>
    <li> this product works really well and i dont have bad morning breath anymore i will be buying this again its great</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothpaste for a couple years now and will never use anything else. The sulfates in regular toothpastes dry out your mouth and cause sores. This stuff is the way to go!</li>
    <li> Been using for years.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Great product, does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Good deal here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> All these products work, but are expensive. I love the mints, too.</li>
    <li> We got this for my son&#x27;s dry mouth issues (due to medications) and now our whole family likes it.  The taste does not overwhelm your mouth and your mouth feels clean afterwards.  Most toothpastes are very heavily minted.  This past does not froth as much as regular pastes, so you need to expect that - but we don&#x27;t mind it at all.  We also got the mouthwash, which is good for a rinse or two, mid-day.</li>
    <li> great product, recommend</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t make your mouth feel clean at all.  I switched to Dentisse, an old favorite.  Sometimes I add a little of this stuff to my Dentisse toothpaste, mainly, just to use it up.&lt;br /&gt;TOO BAD!</li>
    <li> Expensive, but it only takes a bit.  Kill bad breath and seems to work well together with TheraBreath Mouthwash (highly recommend).  It has helped a lot with eliminating tonsil stones.</li>
    <li> Excellent price. My husband uses this.</li>
    <li> I bought therabreath rinse first and it really works immediately! So I bought the toothpaste to strengthen the effect. It is Okay but the experience of brushing teeth is not that good as it does not create any bubble. Yes I know that&#x27;s one of the selling point as it is said the bubbles are not good....Last, not sure if anyone has the bad effect that the teeth are getting not that white with the rinse?</li>
    <li> It works sometimes, other times it doesn&#x27;t.  Not sure why.  I have to brush twice, with a lot of toothpaste to feel that my mouth is clean. When I use at night with the mouthwash, most times there&#x27;s NO morning breath, but few times there is.</li>
    <li> I seemed to have an allergic reaction in back of throat causing me to continually clear throat. It does stop bad breath.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this tooth paste. It is effective without all the strong flavor of more commercial products. He can&#x27;t be without this brand, he swears by it. I found that it does not have the bubbling of other tooth pastes, which I found hard to get use to at first. . . but soon started to notice how it leaves your teeth with a smooth and extra clean feel.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Walgreen&#x27;s originally just to see how it was. I really like it, I can&#x27;t stand the strong minty ones and this doesn&#x27;t have that. I have noticed a big difference in the looks of my teeth and I just had a cleaning apmt and the dentist said my teeth were great.  I will order from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> Out of nowhere I started having bad breath at a month at a time and then it would go away. I tried different toothpastes from the grocery stores. I tried tongue scrapers. I tried a multitude of mouth washes. Then I finally found Therabreath. It has taken care of my bad breath at those times dramatically. I also use the mouth wash after I brush my teeth which I believe helps too. You don&#x27;t use water with it and you don&#x27;t rinse your mouth from toothpaste to mouthwash as it is supposed to act together. Recently I ran out of toothpaste and tried my wife&#x27;s Colgate and still used the mouthwash and within 2 days my bad breath was noticeable hours after brushing. I will be a long time customer for sure as when I got my shipment in the bad breath went away that day.</li>
    <li> I had some massive bad breath and was super self-conscious about it.  Now c&#x27;mon, I&#x27;m a cute lady and the bad breath was killing me and was completely embarrassing.  I did my due diligence as I do with all new products I use (who&#x27;s anal???...me).  I came upon TheraBreath, read the reviews (the good, the bad, the ugly), and decided it was a $10 investment I was willing to make.  Actually, I spent more than $10 because I got the tongue scraper, the mouth wash, the lozenges, the tongue spray (umm yes, that&#x27;s how paranoid I was), basically the whole nine.  Used the toothpaste and all the other products and I was cured!  I know, I know...really? was I cured?  You have to diligently use the toothpaste, don&#x27;t switch back to your old stuff, because the bad breath will come back.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3-4 years now and no longer need the other stuff, just the toothpaste.  I have fresh breath ALL the time, except of course after I first wake up, eww.  Don&#x27;t expect minty freshness, that sensation is put in regular toothpaste to play with your head and get you thinking your breath and mouth are fresh, they are not.&lt;br /&gt;Just a side note: if you have tonsil issues (aka craters in your tonsils where food accumulates and rots), this will contribute to your bad breath.  TheraBreath has a product that you gargle and swallow and this helps neutralize the the odor causing agents in your tonsils.&lt;br /&gt;Give this product a fair chance, follow the directions to the T before you get give up on it.  There is hope for you and you deserve good breath and to rid yourself of that paranoia.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> I love the Dr. Katz toothpaste; it really works to help curb bad breath, especially when used in combination with the mouthwash.  I&#x27;ve been using these for about four years, and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> The best on the Market. I say no more!!!</li>
    <li> like many products inside a box, the actual size is much smaller---and I think that regular baking soda toothpaste would be comparable and much less expensive</li>
    <li> the product works and I would recommend it to who ever needs it.  I also use the oral rinse and the lozenges</li>
    <li> When I first tried this item, it was a little unusual. First, it doesn&#x27;t foam up like regular toothpastes, but you still don&#x27;t need a lot. It has very little flavor, but still seems to work great.&lt;br /&gt;It whitens better than the Crest, Colgate, and Aquafresh types I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like my breath is far better than ever before (especially when combined with the mouthwash), and dry mouth is a thing of the past.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and don&#x27;t rinse the toothpaste (which leaves a gritty feeling for just a minute - easily remedied by using the mouthwash immediately after). Don&#x27;t expect a &#x27;traditional&#x27; highly-foaming, over-flavored toothpaste; but, it&#x27;s highly effective anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using for 2 months now, and the only time I felt my mouth was back to dry and smelly was when I was taking Sudafed because of a cold. It seems like the Sudafed changed the chemistry of my mouth, but after I stopped the medication, Dr. Katz worked just as well as before.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have always had issues with sensitivity due to exposed root - meaning I could never use the strong toothpastes (Crest, Colgate, etc.) for more than a week without pain and having to switch to a &#x27;sensitive&#x27; which never left my mouth feeling clean. Been using Dr. Katz for 2 months and haven&#x27;t even had a twinge of pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons (or rather, adjustments to my thinking):&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t foam. Discovered that it doesn&#x27;t need to, and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;* Tastes very plain. If it didn&#x27;t work so well, I would almost swear there was nothing in it.&lt;br /&gt;* A little gritty. Totally worth it for fresh breath. Also easily remedied by using the Dr. Katz mouthwash after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Leaves breath feeling great! (Just follow instructions and don&#x27;t rinse with water)&lt;br /&gt;* Is great for sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;* Haven&#x27;t found a better whitener, ever! Teeth haven&#x27;t been this white since high school.&lt;br /&gt;* Removes coffee stains well.&lt;br /&gt;* Resolved dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;*Was expecting it to be expensive but with brushing 4 times a day, a tube lasted just over a month which is cheaper than the Crest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be using this toothpaste from now on!</li>
    <li> This works great for dry mouths and bad breath, it really does. However, it falls short on cleaning power. Even with using a sonicare brush for the full two minutes until it shuts off automatically using this toothpaste leaves a little bit of something on my teeth. I have to use another brand to get my teeth feeling completely clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they just added some more abrasives to this toothpaste I&#x27;m sure that would fix the problem. That one issue i have is the only reason I took a star off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, best toothpaste and mouthwash I&#x27;ve used for dry mouth and bad breath. It made a gigantic difference in that department for sure. I even notice the fact that other toothpastes do indeed burn my mouth and leave them dry when I use them. I really wish they would add more abrasives, or offer a toothpaste with the same goal that has more abrasives to address this issue. I have recommended this toothpaste to several friends and family and they all have the same gripe with the toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Dr. Katz for years.  If you, or someone you know has breath that can get offensive, (most of the time the offender does not know he has bad breath), use this product.  It eliminates bad breath.  This toothpaste and mouthwash changed my life.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this toothpaste made my breath any fresher. And it tastes weird!!! Tastes like the gel on the crest whitening strips, weird! It also made my teeth very sensitive after using it for only 2 days. I may try it just to clean my tongue that way I can use up the bottle. I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s even worth it but I&#x27;ll give it a shot. I will leave an update if I change my mind about this product, although I doubt I will.</li>
    <li> Really does clean the breath. For use along with its mouthwash. The toothpaste is mild tasting and will not burn your mouth with harsh chemicals or flavors.</li>
    <li> Use with Dr. Katz TheraBreath Oral Rinse (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ET76AI/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_135).  These two with throughout-the-day mouthwashing with TheraBreath Oral Rinse (other non-alcoholic-containing rinses can be used), finally addressed my terrible bad-breath.  If I ever fail in this approach, the bad-breath always returns.</li>
    <li> I have been fighting bad breath for years; I mean YEARS.  Nothing has worked.  I heard a commercial about this product and decided to try it.  It is the first time in my life that I haven&#x27;t had bad breath.  I use it with the mouth wash.  My only problem is that I have to wear a mouth piece at night (TMJ) and when I wake up, the mouth piece smells like my breath use to smell.  I do understand Dr. Katz&#x27;s explanation about the lack of saliva during the night.&lt;br /&gt;Well, that&#x27;s okay, I guess.  The main thing is that my students don&#x27;t back away from me when I&#x27;m talking to them.</li>
    <li> Removes the embarassment of bad breath!</li>
    <li> After trying the mouthwash only for a while it was good, and no it didn&#x27;t rid me of my tonsil stones like some users said it did, but it did it&#x27;s job of decreasing but not removing, my bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;but now that I am using the toothpaste, it is just simply greeeeaaaaat, I have no more bad breath, which now I know was mainly caused by my dry mouth and my tongue, so please do brush your tongue and you will get the results directly...&lt;br /&gt;As also some users said the only problem is that you miss the feeling of minty toothpaste, I solved this problem by giving my teeth a quick brush with my normal toothpaste after I finish with Therabreath toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;to make things short, GET THE TOOTHPASTE!!!</li>
    <li> it works awesome&lt;br /&gt;no more bad breath and it last long, about 12 hours&lt;br /&gt;great product&lt;br /&gt;recommend it to anyone who has breath problems</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is not as potent as advertised. It didn&#x27;t really do much. The mouthwash works a lot better. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product on Groupon and was skeptical about, but figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  It really really works!!! It doesn&#x27;t mask bad breath, as a matter of fact, it doesn&#x27;t even have much taste. It simply leaves your breath smelling fresh, even when you wake up in the morning. Worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> I received one pack with one toothpaste when it is clearly said that I should have a pack of 2. So I am confused.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t work, just waist of money SCAM</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months and it&#x27;s been quite refreshing with long lasting fresh breath. for whatever it&#x27;s worth, I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> My husband has had a horrible problem with bad breath for years.  Since using this product, he has not had one day of bad breath!  Wish we had found this product years ago!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using these toothpastes for years. They are the best. No artificial stuff. Fights bad breath.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste absolutely helps with bad breath and dry mouth. The only issue is it doesnt whitened teeth much. I use a different paste, use Baking soda etc, and then brush with this after. My teeth are white and smell good all day.</li>
    <li> I struggled with bad breath and since using this product and the Oral Rinse plus Lozenges, I&#x27;ve not had a problem.</li>
    <li> my husband has used these theraBreath products for years (along w/mouth rinse) and swears by them. He will not go without them. His monthly subscription ran out early, so we had to buy a couple extra! These are essentials in our house.</li>
    <li> I use this daily now in conjunction with the mouth wash from them. I used to have dry mouth and bad breath all the time - even after brushing... I tried a lot of different products including tongue brushes... nothing seemed to work. Within days of using the mouth wash my bad breath was gone so I decided to try the toothpaste as well... My mouth feels fresh all day long now... highly recommended for anyone... it&#x27;s expensive but one tube lasts about as long as a tube of regular toothpaste did.</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s ok.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a nice takes in my mouth; doesn&#x27;t even make my mouth taste fresh.  I can&#x27;t say I like the chalky feeling I get after brushing with it either.  However, when I use it at night, my mouth doesn&#x27;t have the dreaded morning breath the next day, so for that I will be happy enough with it.  I&#x27;ll use this product before bed and stick with my other toothpaste for the morning.  I like my mouth to feel moist and fresh in the mornings; can&#x27;t give that up.</li>
    <li> So this toothpaste has cleared my &amp;#34;dragon breath&amp;#34;. I used to brush my teeth 3+ times a day with regular toothpaste and STILL have bad breath. I would also floss and use mouth wash to no avail. This stuff is golden! Get it ASAP if you have a breath problem. I have noticed it is also sold at my local Wal-Mart (just fyi if you don&#x27;t want to order online). Seriously, can&#x27;t give this product enough praise. It has been a life changer. I am no longer self conscious at work or social events worrying about my breath and if it is bad or not.</li>
    <li> Good but expensive toothpaste!</li>
    <li> The nastiest, overpriced toothpaste known to man.  Did not get to the second bottle.  The inside of my cheek experienced a chemical burn from whatever&#x27;s in there.  Do not buy if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great price! Great product!</li>
    <li> There is a little salty, after brushing feeling tone has improved, but not last.Overall you can. He felt it。Good。I hope you can help</li>
    <li> Please do not buy this product. The ingredients differ from the actual therabreath toothpaste. I noticed this when i purchased the multi syptom probiotic. I recieved some toothpaste in the kit and when i used it it frothed up and work so much better then the toothpaste i bought here. So i looked at the ingredients and noticed the this product is a fake all around. Do yourself a favor and order these products from the therabreath website.</li>
    <li> After reading the instructions that came with the toothpaste, I found out that you need to order additional Dr. Katz rinsing liquid after brushing the teeth with the TheraBreath toothpaste. Anyway, I did not bother ordering the rinsing liquid so I can&#x27;t say for sure if the toothpaste is doing what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;If this rinsing liquid is mandatory then it should be sold as a package with the toothpaste so the consumer does not get a surprise after reading the instructions on how to use the toothpaste.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my 7 year old boy. Dont smell bad breathe. Its instant results.</li>
    <li> This rinse is not strong or to minty or artificial tasting, but it does the job. I always use it.</li>
    <li> I personally do not really like the taste of this. It could be because I am so used to brushing with something very minty, but this toothpaste just doesn&#x27;t leave me with that fresh feeling. It works though.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is a game changer. Not only for dry mouth but getting rid of bad breath. It&#x27;s amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggle with bad breath for a while now. Even after I brushed my teeth my wife would notice a bad smell. The first time I used the product my wife noticed an immediate difference. Now my entire family uses this along with the mouth wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply follow the instructions provided and your breath will be fresh the entire day. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> love how this toothpaste uses natural ingredients and oxygenating compounds to keep my breath fresh.  my 9 yr old loves its gentle flavoring, and it is the only toothpaste she likes to use.  my mother with cancer even says it helps get the bad &amp;#34;chemo&amp;#34; taste out of her mouth.</li>
    <li> Very good product and works well with water and mouth wash. It dry&#x27;s the mouth and leaves a taste in the mouth.</li>
    <li> I love TheraBreath mouthwash, so I thought I&#x27;d try their toothpaste. I was a bit disappointed. First of all, the toothpaste has pretty much no flavor. Maybe I&#x27;m brainwashed by &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; toothpaste, but I didn&#x27;t feel like my mouth was clean after brushing.</li>
    <li> The longer I used the toothpaste, the more I noticed I was getting sores.  Stopped using for a couple weeks, started again and the same thing happened.  I ended up throwing it away, what a waste.</li>
    <li> stuff is a little pricey but I choose it  over the generic stuff you find elsewhere</li>
    <li> Best mouthwash there is!!!</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well. I smoke cigars and it really helps kill the odor. Both mouthwash and toothpaste work pretty well.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this toothpaste makes my mouth feel!  I&#x27;d used Therabreath from QVC for years, but they stopped making it, and this is just as good!  Thank you!  I wish everyone used this and had sweet smelling breath!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather at all or create a &amp;#34;patented oxygenating effect&amp;#34; when combined with TheraBreath mouthwash as claimed.  Feels like you&#x27;re brushing with plain aloe vera gel, teeth don&#x27;t feel clean at all, still fuzzy with plaque.  Went back to old toothpaste after 2 weeks.  Mouthwash does work very well, though.</li>
    <li> I tried other products , when I have allergy and sinus, so taking antihistamine makes dry mouth, , this is the best</li>
    <li> This stuff works.  I don&#x27;t know what was happening in my mouth lately, but all of a sudden I started developing bad breath.  It was embarrassing for my husband to tell me my mouth stinks.  I brush twice a day, gargle and floss and that didn&#x27;t help.  I decided to spend the money on this.  The toothpaste taste like hydrogen peroxide mixed with baking soda, but it wasn&#x27;t bad.  The toothpaste was fine and I use it twice a day.  You put the toothpaste on a dry toothbrush, then brush away.  I bought the TheraBreath Oral Rinse too, and rinse my mouth with that.  After just 2-3 days of using this regimen, it WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste seems to last me a long time-- I&#x27;m still on my first tube.  However, the TheraBreath Oral Rinse, doesn&#x27;t because instead of using water to rinse your mouth, you use the Oral Rinse twice a day; so I am now in my second bottle.  I found the best prices and deals to be on Amazon for these products.&lt;br /&gt;Just a note, there are many reasons why bad breath happens.  I was shocked to read that depression, stress, and hormonal changes affect your breath, among some of them.</li>
    <li> I do like this toothpaste and it does feel like it guards against bad breath, especially residual coffee breath and that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
    <li> This takes some getting used to. It&#x27;s mint flavored but doesn&#x27;t have color or sweetness. It doesn&#x27;t lather or foam up either. While brushing, my mouth feels like it&#x27;s just full of saliva. If you&#x27;re used to your normal toothpaste, you may or may not like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this toothpaste does clean teeth and helps with freshening the breath. TheraBreath products doesn&#x27;t just mask bad breath. It kills the bacteria that causes the problems by oxygenation. The freshness is lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this toothpaste with the mouthwash from the same line and got great results. I also had great results with just the mouthwash alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So because I like my bubbles, I went back to my Crest toothpaste. But I stuck with the TheraBreath mouthwash which is a 5 star product. Actually, I&#x27;d give the mouthwash more stars if I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend trying the mouthwash first. If you find that you need to add the toothpaste to your oral hygiene regimen as well, then get it.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste.  Can&#x27;t always find it at Wal Mart.</li>
    <li> It really works all day!</li>
    <li> Not really sure if it worked or not.</li>
    <li> Nice clean mouth, without residual sweeteners, or detergents left behind in your mouth, and is neutral on the palate.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Smells like peroxide with soda and maybe a little mint. I don&#x27;t think it cleans well, it is not foamy. I will not buy again</li>
    <li> Used this toothpaste and the mouth wash the same company sells and I was surprised. My teeth will literally stay clean for 12 at least. The toothpaste itself is a little different - it&#x27;s more like gel than it is paste, but it works, so I&#x27;m fine with it.</li>
    <li> My review is easy: my son needed a toothpaste to help with this daily bad breath... then I found this toothpaste (and oral rinse). IT WORKS, that easy. Use as directly and bad breath is gone, instantly. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The toothpaste is great at getting rid of bad breath. Also, I have sensitive teeth and don&#x27;t have any trouble with this toothpaste. It cleans your teeth too :)</li>
    <li> So faar I think it&#x27;s going to help me more than Biotene.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Has a clean, fresh taste, with no after taste (always a plus); Does leave my mouth feeling clean right after using; Does not irritate my sensitive gums.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The fresh feeling does not last long; This does not foam up at all, feels &amp; looks, like I&#x27;m brushing with flavored water; I&#x27;ve had a couple of issues with mouth dryness since using this, but I&#x27;m not convinced yet if this isn&#x27;t working, or if it was just &amp;#34;one of those things&amp;#34; that happen for no apparent reason  :-)</li>
    <li> By utilizing this product it quickly increased my level of confidence. I will continue to recommend this product for years to come</li>
</ol>
