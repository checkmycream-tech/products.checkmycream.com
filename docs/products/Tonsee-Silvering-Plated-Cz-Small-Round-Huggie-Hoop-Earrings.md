<li> I know that someday I will loose that due to the lock/snap is weak or not deep enough.</li>
<li> /&gt;Where is my other set?</li>
<li> Very small.</li>

    <li> Very curved post. Caused some difficulties to put on</li>

    <li> Way too big for cartilage but it works for earlobes!</li>
    <li> Came faster than I thought and they fit great I never take them out :)</li>
    <li> Just got them and there a little but bigger than I expected but I bought them as  cartilage earrings, they a very sparkly and shiny an pretty</li>
    <li> I ordered and paid for two sets and I received ONLY one.&lt;br /&gt;Where is my other set?</li>
    <li> They are quite pretty. The Cz shine really well. Can&#x27;t beat the price if your willing to wait for delivery.</li>
    <li> Very pretty and shine</li>
    <li> Beautiful but I can&#x27;t wear them. They make my ears itchy. I&#x27;ve cleaned them with alcohol but still itchy. Unusual because I have worn other silver earrings and even costume jewelry with no problem, but I can&#x27;t use these.</li>
    <li> To tiny they are like for baby or toddlers.  But they are darling.</li>
    <li> Very small. I can&#x27;t even get them in my ears plus they don&#x27;t stay closed</li>
    <li> Love them. I thought that they were kind of little when I got them. Thought they were a good fit for my daughter. But I tried them on and are the perfect size. I shower and sleep in them. No color change and barely feel them when sleeping. I would definitely buy again if I need too...</li>
