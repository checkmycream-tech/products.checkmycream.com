### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is GREAT!  </li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>Love this stuff !!!</li>
      <li>Great.  Very effective.</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied and feel confident to wear skirts and dresses again!</li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>After many internet searches I found this product with lots of good reviews....</li>
      <li>It covers very well and the color is just perfect.  </li>
      <li>This product may work for someone with very smooth skin, but for me it was blotchy and cakey.</li>
      <li>I tried Leg Magic with a lot of doubt but I am pleased with the way it smooths onto my skin and it covers blemishes quite well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I stumbled across this product..</li>
      <li>Undoubtedly with some expertise, the product could go on more evenly, just not my luck.</li>
      <li>Be sure you put it on by &#x27;patting&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than using makeup foundation to cover up unwanted veins</li>
      <li>, then pat on the leg magic, and pat/blend the two areas that meet.  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;I ordered Leg Magic</li>
      <li>Just make sure to read the instructions and pat, pat, pat.</li>
      <li>This works better than dermablend for covering up tattoos.  </li>
      <li>I find I am able to wear shorter skirts without feeling embarrassed.  </li>
      <li>and you can tell the leg magic was on it because it did not blend into with my skin tone.</li>
      <li>I use it in my legs mostly.</li>
      <li>3 stars as easy to apply and some coverage.</li>
      <li>It does a credible job of covering the blemishes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a true beige in indoor lighting but pinkish in sunlight.  </li>
      <li>It stays well and is very quick and easy to apply and I don&#x27;t feel that I&#x27;m wearing anything; my legs feel natural and free.</li>
      <li>At first I ordered a light color and darker color and blended them, but eventually found the right shade.</li>
      <li>I think one may want to try blending 2 colors together for a more natural look, but that really depends on your skin tone.</li>
      <li>For the price I was definitely expecting something better.</li>
      <li>The line is gone, goes through hot summer days of golf and sweating.</li>
      <li>I tried many products to cover the line on my lower chin, upper neck area....</li>
      <li>You can find a munch better color match/quality from regular water proof foundation!</li>
      <li>Trying it for the first time just one tone is all that&#x27;s needed.</li>
      <li>and i think more obvious.</li>
      <li>You really should moisturize first and then apply it.</li>
      <li>and nothing really worked.  </li>
      <li>It just goes on so much easier that way.</li>
      <li>Very rude!\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Really works so well.</li>
      <li>it covers really well.</li>
      <li>but well worth the experimenting of different colors.  </li>
      <li>So for other problems maybe it would be fine.</li>
      <li>but that hasn&#x27;t seem to have helped to clear up the lower \\&quot;superficial\\&quot; veins.  </li>
      <li>Although these are not completely hidden</li>
      <li>only complaint is that I wish someone would manufacture a leg cover that allows a natural shine to be sustained on the skin because it would look more natural.</li>
      <li>What I didn&#x27;t like about the product is the fact that even after letting it dry really well it still smeared my clothes.  </li>
      <li>I apply my other face make up first</li>
      <li>I have had medical procedures to clear up larger veins on my upper leg</li>

    <li> Maybe I needed a lighter shade and will test it again with a tan. It could work well for other pronlems but I was trying to cover spider veins. It made them appear raised and i think more obvious. Maybe i did it wrong or my shade was too dark?  So for other problems maybe it would be fine. 3 stars as easy to apply and some coverage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I stumbled across this product..it covers really well. I think one may want to try blending 2 colors together for a more natural look, but that really depends on your skin tone. Trying it for the first time just one tone is all that&#x27;s needed. Just make sure to read the instructions and pat, pat, pat.</li>
    <li> I tried many products to cover the line on my lower chin, upper neck area....and nothing really worked.  After many internet searches I found this product with lots of good reviews.... I tried it! It is GREAT!  Be sure you put it on by &#x27;patting&#x27;.  I apply my other face make up first, then pat on the leg magic, and pat/blend the two areas that meet.  Works great! The line is gone, goes through hot summer days of golf and sweating. It is hard to find your &#x27;color&#x27;, but well worth the experimenting of different colors.  At first I ordered a light color and darker color and blended them, but eventually found the right shade. I have used it for 8 years in this manner.</li>
    <li> Great.  Very effective.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I ordered Leg Magic and it did not work at all. I bought it to cover up a birthmark and it did not work. I still saw the mark and you can tell the leg magic was on it because it did not blend into with my skin tone. I contacted the seller twice to see if i can get a refund and they never answered me. I am so mad that I did not ever get a response. They could of at least told me no. Very rude!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I ordered this product in hopes of covering up some dark veins on my lower leg and ankle.  I have had medical procedures to clear up larger veins on my upper leg but that hasn&#x27;t seem to have helped to clear up the lower \\&quot;superficial\\&quot; veins.  If applied by \\&quot;patting\\&quot; it does an unbelievable job of covering up the veins.  I was skeptical that is was going to look like \\&quot;make up\\&quot; but after it dried, it really blended in with my skin.  I am very satisfied and feel confident to wear skirts and dresses again!</li>
    <li> I know I&#x27;ll be ordering this product again. Really works so well. I use it in my legs mostly. You really should moisturize first and then apply it. It just goes on so much easier that way. Love this stuff !!!</li>
    <li> I only use it on occasion .but it does the trick.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a true beige in indoor lighting but pinkish in sunlight.  Whether you&#x27;ll like it depends on where you&#x27;ll be wearing it.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this order. Not only was it late but the box was open and the product has been used.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with my purchase. The coverage was bad (didn&#x27;t even cover my very minor spider veins), the color looked orange, and didn&#x27;t blend in well. For the price I was definitely expecting something better. You can find a munch better color match/quality from regular water proof foundation!</li>
    <li> It covers very well and the color is just perfect.  What I didn&#x27;t like about the product is the fact that even after letting it dry really well it still smeared my clothes.  You can&#x27;t use this and wear white !</li>
    <li> This works better than dermablend for covering up tattoos.  I love this product!  I put the product on, let it dry, and then put pantyhose on.  You cannot even tell I have makeup on my legs through the panty hose.</li>
    <li> This product may work for someone with very smooth skin, but for me it was blotchy and cakey. Couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it off, I mean scrub! Undoubtedly with some expertise, the product could go on more evenly, just not my luck.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s better than using makeup foundation to cover up unwanted veins</li>
    <li> I have used other products that claim to cover blemishes on the legs and they do...but they&#x27;re difficult and messy to apply and left my legs feeling sticky and &amp;#34;caked&amp;#34; and the colour rubbed of onto furniture if I put my legs up..  I tried Leg Magic with a lot of doubt but I am pleased with the way it smooths onto my skin and it covers blemishes quite well.  I&#x27;ve had varicose veins and although I had treatment for them spider veins appeared as a result of the procedure.  Although these are not completely hidden I find I am able to wear shorter skirts without feeling embarrassed.  It stays well and is very quick and easy to apply and I don&#x27;t feel that I&#x27;m wearing anything; my legs feel natural and free. I&#x27;ve discovered that it doesn&#x27;t rub Off!  This is GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I wish someone would manufacture a leg cover that allows a natural shine to be sustained on the skin because it would look more natural.</li>
    <li> This is a waste  of money!!!! This product doesn&#x27;t not work as they said, I applied on my skin I my scars and vein still show , I just tried once and I discarded,</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually use it all over, just on spots I want to blend in. As summer progresses, I mix it with a darker shade and sometimes apply all over legs.</li>
    <li> I have a circular burn on my leg along with a long scar from my partial knee replacement.  It does a credible job of covering the blemishes.</li>
    <li> I was not pleased with this product at all - it had a very very thick substance and did not go on very well.  I looked like I had chalk on my legs. I returned the product.  Thank you</li>
