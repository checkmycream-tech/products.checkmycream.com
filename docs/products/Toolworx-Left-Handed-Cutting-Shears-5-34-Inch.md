      <li>Didn&#x27;t make my wife a better barber though.</li>

      <li>You can easily pull them out if you have fat fingers.  </li>
      <li>They do not look or feel like pro-level shears, but for home use, they work just fine.</li>

      <li>Excellent cutting edge, well balanced and not cumbersome.  </li>
      <li>The tips are not made to cut very close to the ends like some shears and this can be a disadvantage with close trimming.  </li>

<li> Very sharp tip, be careful.</li>
<li> Very sharp hoping it holds an edge.</li>
<li> These scissors are sharp and have maintained their edge over the past year or so of use.</li>
<li> On the other hand they are not so expensive that they are unaffordable or that the increase in price is not worth the difference in performance.</li>
<li> They were unable to replace with correct ones</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price of these scissors.</li>
<li> you get what you pay for though and pprofessional shears are very expensive.</li>
<li> any lefty will not be disappointed</li>

    <li> Good product use just a few times now and they work great thank you for a quality product like this</li>
    <li> Contrary to a few reviews I read prior to purchasing these scissors, they \\&quot;ARE\\&quot; left handed scissors.  Sharp and solid build.  They come with plastic finger sizing inserts.  You can easily pull them out if you have fat fingers.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price of these scissors.</li>

    <li> I received these but they are not the offset as pictured. They were unable to replace with correct ones so I have to assume they do not carry the offset shears.</li>
    <li> I am a barber and I own a barber school and one of the guys i am teaching is left handed i order these shears for him and when i opened them up they looked great. the went to open and close the they where smooth till they got to the end and the stopped and they was not all the way closed yet the tips are bent in</li>
    <li> They are perfect! I use them to trim show dogs&#x27; paws and ears - not one problem with them!</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair - she&#x27;s a lefty. These scissors are sharp and have maintained their edge over the past year or so of use. They do not look or feel like pro-level shears, but for home use, they work just fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an amateur hairstylist and didn&#x27;t want to spend big bucks on hair scissors. These were a great buy and cut my husband&#x27;s hair just fine. He has thick, curly hair and the scissors are sharp enough to give him a good and precise cut.</li>
    <li> Overall better quality than I was expecting. Didn&#x27;t make my wife a better barber though. Very sharp tip, be careful.</li>
    <li> They were bought to trim my kids hair on occasion. Bangs, etc. They are built well and cut nice and clean with no need to adjust so far. I wish they came with a case but for the price, I&#x27;ll improvise. The shear tips are pointy, so care around the eyes is important. As a man with large hands I&#x27;ve been able to use them comfortably without taking out the trim rings. But keep in mind I&#x27;m not doing full hair cuts.</li>
    <li> I bought this prodcut for my girlfriend who is left handed, so that she could cut my hair.  I have no way to personally review this product except t o say that she said they were very nice, the same pair that her sister owned, who IS a professional stylist.  She mentioned they were very nice and comfortable, and the tightening screw allows for exacting sharpness.  I give 4 of 5 stars only because I will never really be using them on anyone else myself. Pleased with the product</li>
