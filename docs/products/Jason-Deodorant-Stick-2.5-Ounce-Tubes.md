### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Not the best or what i come to expect from the Jason brand</li>
      <li>Their scents are great too!</li>
      <li>All in all, the price is good... try it!</li>
      <li>The feel and smell are great.</li>
      <li>and it smelled great but did nothing to mask body odor.</li>
      <li>scent is great.</li>
      <li>I ended up getting dessert essence tea tree deodorant and it works great.</li>
      <li>It used to smell so wonderful and like a light lavender</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>Nice smell and texture</li>
      <li>The Jason Lavender smells good to me, works fine, and causes me no bumps.</li>
      <li>This is the best one I have found do far, but you&#x27;ll need to reapply.</li>
      <li>Smells lovely, is perfect for sensitive skin and glands, but lasts 18 hours rather than 24.</li>
      <li>I also really love the smell.</li>
      <li>I would smell better if I put on nothing at all.</li>
      <li>This is more healther without causing any under arm problems.</li>
      <li>so perhaps they work a bit better than this one.</li>
      <li>I also wanted to love this.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Crystal Rock Deodorant is much better at keeping away smells and sweat, but is unsented.</li>
      <li>and I love the smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many, more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants over the years and found that while they never make me itch, most of them just don&#x27;t work and need to be reapplied throughout the day.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is kind of strong when you first apply it</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what is in this, but it makes your B.O. super concentrated!</li>
      <li>This has been the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth and comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>Also what is the deal with corn starch in the aluminium free deodorant?</li>
      <li>I was super excited about this being paraben free and vegan.</li>
      <li>stuff keeps me dry and smelling great all day (6-12 hours).</li>
      <li>I wanted to try this deodorant because I liked the all natural aspect.</li>
      <li>If I could find something else this easy that was more natural, I&#x27;d be all over it.</li>
      <li>but it is more important to be health conscious than smell good for a short period of time</li>
      <li>Seriously, this thing is impressive on how smelly and sticky it makes you!</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, the first day I used it at work was a disaster!</li>
      <li>and I was smelling like a freshly cut onion,</li>
      <li>, then apply a ton of the deodorant (I think I use 4-5 passes or more each time I apply) and let it completely dry/set before you put clothes on.</li>
      <li>This is right for me cause store brought deodorant break me out.  </li>
      <li>, however it wears off pretty easily, and i am not a heavy sweater....</li>
      <li>There were days that I forgot to put on deodorant, and didn&#x27;t have much odor at all!</li>
      <li>Because it&#x27;s natural, I don&#x27;t expect it to work like the bad-ingredient filled stuff.  </li>
      <li>The first day I used it</li>
      <li>Many non-antiperspirant deodorants rub on wet/damp, and you just start off feeling gross.</li>
      <li>I have an allergy to something in most commercial deodorant/antiperspirant sticks.</li>
      <li>(Parfum).&lt;br /&gt;The first ingredient Butylphenyl methylpropional is a synthetic fragrance that is used in a number of beauty products.</li>
      <li>It is considered safe only within recommended use of concentration.</li>
      <li>huge plus is that It&#x27;s a nice, solid material, so you&#x27;re not all wet immediately after you put it on (</li>
      <li>I give this 4 stars mainly because so far, it&#x27;s the best natural, non-antiperspirant deodorant that I have ever tired by far, and for an average day at work, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
      <li>huge plus considering that it is not going to prevent you from sweating, only from smelling).</li>
      <li>I really want to like this product, believe me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;P.S. who wants to put a methyl under their arms?&lt;br /&gt;Methyl and Propyl and Butyl and Ethyl Paraben -- Used as inhibitors of microbial growth and to extend shelf life of products.</li>
      <li>I really did.</li>
      <li>It is very bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I purchased this deodorant and it DID NOT keep me fresh as it suppose to do being a supposedly natural deodorant.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really detectable after that</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this</li>
      <li>It is really sticky, but I was willing to live with it for the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a skin irritant and there have been tests that found that skin applications of BM at high concentrations in animals caused sperm damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly toxic.</li>
      <li>Still better than all the other natural ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>First, let me say I am retired and not very active.</li>
      <li>I use natural deodorant because I am very cautious with products that I put in or on my body.</li>
      <li>You will notice it does get on shirts, but after a few hours it seems to rub into your skin more like lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>right now I&#x27;m stuck with 2 extra things of it, ha.</li>
      <li>It has changed now to a new and improved formula (so called).  </li>
      <li>My armpits are not my mouth, and they definitely would not like to be a breeding ground for yeast, thanks!</li>
      <li>I am sure they would say it is a small amount.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m now waiting for it to clear up.</li>
      <li>is kind of a cross between the white chalky annoying deodorant and the nice clear alternative.</li>
      <li>A report in the January-February 2004 issue of the Journal of Applied Toxicology states that when several breast tumors were examined by researchers, high levels of methylparaben were found in the tissues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parabens, including methylparaben, have estrogenic affects on the body, which means they can affect the reproductive glands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I do have to freshen up a few times a day, but I don&#x27;t mind since it&#x27;s not bad for me.  </li>
      <li>and I am a pretty active person who  spends a lot of time walking and moving around throughout the day.</li>
      <li>It also gave me a red rash kind of thing.. no good!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been off the bad stuff for about five years now and am happy to have found this one.  </li>
      <li>I will continue to search for a natural deodorant that actually works.</li>
      <li>(However, note that apparently it does contain zinc?</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t even barely mask the smell of body odor and in fact, I chaffed and my arm pits turned red.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve yet to find a natural stick that lasts long enough.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve even tried several other JASON deodorants but the lavender scent is the only one that works.</li>

<li> I smelled gross after a few hours of daily tasks.</li>
<li> I have done nothing even remotely strenuous and can literally smell myself.</li>
<li> It seems they are cutting costs, just like many other companies, and using very little lavender oil, and lots of substitutes to give it a smell.  </li>
<li> If I wear them for more than one day in a row my skin itches like crazy, which is not fun because walking around desperately scratching your underarms isn&#x27;t exactly ladylike.</li>

<li> I have tried a couple of other alternative deodorant sticks, but none provided the protection of Jason&#x27;s without the harmful aluminum.</li>
<li> (it doesnt hold off sweat very long)!!!</li>
<li> last ingredients, as well as the first, contribute to the awful smell of the new and improved deoderant.</li>
<li> The accompany needs to do something to make it keep odorous down not mask it with lavender.</li>
<li> If I could give it half a star I would.</li>
<li> &quot;  Sorry to slam this new and improved product</li>
<li> So perhaps they are cheating a little bit?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve yet to find a natural stick that lasts long enough. This is the best one I have found do far, but you&#x27;ll need to reapply.</li>
    <li> Although this is not marked as an anti-perspirant, it seems to work as one. I did notice Zinc in the ingredients, which is commonly used for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff keeps me dry and smelling great all day (6-12 hours). Depending on the humidity/heat/etc. Re-applying 2-3 times a day may be necessary as natural products dissolve and evaporate faster than complex (often toxic) chemicals designed for a specific purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is great. I&#x27;m a big fan of lavender and in my opinion Tom&#x27;s lavender deodorant smells a bit like fruity pebbles and feels sticky under the arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opacity/texture:&lt;br /&gt;This is kind of a cross between the white chalky annoying deodorant and the nice clear alternative. It has a milky lotion feel and look. You will notice it does get on shirts, but after a few hours it seems to rub into your skin more like lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t feel like chalky paste, wet cold gel, or like a watery roll on. It&#x27;s smooth and comfortable to wear.</li>
    <li> the scent doesn&#x27;t last all day like other Jason products. Even my wife didn&#x27;t like it. Not the best or what i come to expect from the Jason brand</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this deodorant because I liked the all natural aspect. Well, I took a shower and I used the Jason Lavender Deod. It did not work at all. Boy, was I stinky! It was only about four hours and I was doing nothing in an air conditioned house. I could only imagine if I was in the heat or working at my job. I&#x27;m VERY disappointed. If I could give it half a star I would. I&#x27;ll go back to Secret I guess. Sigh.</li>
    <li> I bought this on vacation because I forgot my baking soda/coconut oil concoction that I&#x27;d been using, which was obviously a pain to make and use. But all the commercial products didn&#x27;t work, and the easier homemade stuff was irritating. The Jason Lavender smells good to me, works fine, and causes me no bumps. The one-star dock of this product is because there are definitely a few unpronounceable ingredients. If I could find something else this easy that was more natural, I&#x27;d be all over it. In the mean time, this does the trick.</li>
    <li> The feel and smell are great. But keep in mind this is a DEODERANT, not an ANTIPERSPIRANT.</li>
    <li> I used this product and it did not work for me. It didn&#x27;t even barely mask the smell of body odor and in fact, I chaffed and my arm pits turned red. I used it for an entire week before giving up and going back to what I was using. I will continue to search for a natural deodorant that actually works.</li>
    <li> I have an allergy to something in most commercial deodorant/antiperspirant sticks. If I wear them for more than one day in a row my skin itches like crazy, which is not fun because walking around desperately scratching your underarms isn&#x27;t exactly ladylike. I&#x27;ve tried many, many, more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants over the years and found that while they never make me itch, most of them just don&#x27;t work and need to be reapplied throughout the day. This one is the exception, I get all day odor protection and don&#x27;t have to reapply unless I shower or exercise. I&#x27;ve even tried several other JASON deodorants but the lavender scent is the only one that works. The fragrance is kind of strong when you first apply it but I don&#x27;t notice it after it dries and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really detectable after that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the trick to getting these products to work is to completely dry your underarms after you shower, then apply a ton of the deodorant (I think I use 4-5 passes or more each time I apply) and let it completely dry/set before you put clothes on. Works every time for me and I am a pretty active person who  spends a lot of time walking and moving around throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I showered, applied this deodorant, and went to run a few errands. After returning home an hour later, I realized I was already stinky. I don&#x27;t smell this bad when I wear nothing all day!  I love other Jason products, but this one is just awful. It left a horribly sticky residue as well. Gross!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now.  I love it!  I do have to freshen up a few times a day, but I don&#x27;t mind since it&#x27;s not bad for me.  Because it&#x27;s natural, I don&#x27;t expect it to work like the bad-ingredient filled stuff.  This has been the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found so far.  I&#x27;ve been off the bad stuff for about five years now and am happy to have found this one.  Their scents are great too!</li>
    <li> I really want to like this product, believe me. I&#x27;m crunchy, what can I say? However just because I am crunchy doesn&#x27;t mean I want to smell funk-a-licous! Seriously... I would smell better if I put on nothing at all. I don&#x27;t know what is in this, but it makes your B.O. super concentrated! You can be sitting at home on your butt all day... and you&#x27;ll start to smell like you&#x27;ve been running a 5k in 90 degree weather. Seriously, this thing is impressive on how smelly and sticky it makes you! It also gave me a red rash kind of thing.. no good! Also what is the deal with corn starch in the aluminium free deodorant? My armpits are not my mouth, and they definitely would not like to be a breeding ground for yeast, thanks! All in all, the price is good... try it! Hopefully it works out for you.. cause right now I&#x27;m stuck with 2 extra things of it, ha.</li>
    <li> I had ordered this deoderant for years due to it was  natural. It has changed now to a new and improved formula (so called).  It now smells like men&#x27;s deoderant and it is loud smelling and not light and feminine.  The ingredients Butylphenyl Methylpropional, citral, eugenol, hydroxycitronellal, limonene, linalool, fragrance (Parfum).&lt;br /&gt;The first ingredient Butylphenyl methylpropional is a synthetic fragrance that is used in a number of beauty products. It is considered safe only within recommended use of concentration. It&#x27;s a skin irritant and there have been tests that found that skin applications of BM at high concentrations in animals caused sperm damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last ingredients, as well as the first, contribute to the awful smell of the new and improved deoderant. It seems they are cutting costs, just like many other companies, and using very little lavender oil, and lots of substitutes to give it a smell.  It used to smell so wonderful and like a light lavender smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. who wants to put a methyl under their arms?&lt;br /&gt;Methyl and Propyl and Butyl and Ethyl Paraben -- Used as inhibitors of microbial growth and to extend shelf life of products. THE FRONT LABEL ON THIS DEODERANT SAYS NO: PARABENS.....huh....it has one. I am sure they would say it is a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Methyl paraben combines benzoic acid with the methyl group of chemicals. Highly toxic. Methylparaben is widely used as a preservative in women&#x27;s cosmetics, such as skin creams and deodorants. One of the physical dangers associated with methylparaben is its connection with tumors in the breast. A report in the January-February 2004 issue of the Journal of Applied Toxicology states that when several breast tumors were examined by researchers, high levels of methylparaben were found in the tissues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parabens, including methylparaben, have estrogenic affects on the body, which means they can affect the reproductive glands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what are chemical preservatives such as methyl, propyl, butyl and ethyl parabens doing in personal care products labeled \\&quot;organic?\\&quot;  Sorry to slam this new and improved product but it is more important to be health conscious than smell good for a short period of time (it doesnt hold off sweat very long)!!! I will find another brand that cares about the health of women.</li>
    <li> I give this 4 stars mainly because so far, it&#x27;s the best natural, non-antiperspirant deodorant that I have ever tired by far, and for an average day at work, it&#x27;s pretty good. (However, note that apparently it does contain zinc? So perhaps they are cheating a little bit?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A huge plus is that It&#x27;s a nice, solid material, so you&#x27;re not all wet immediately after you put it on (huge plus considering that it is not going to prevent you from sweating, only from smelling). Many non-antiperspirant deodorants rub on wet/damp, and you just start off feeling gross. And then they don&#x27;t work after that and you also stink. Not this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a react negatively to aluminum-based antiperspirants and I definitely do not react to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things to consider:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I just go ahead and use an actual antiperspirant if I&#x27;m going to be exercising, as this product can&#x27;t keep you from sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) As for smell, yes, I do have to reapply it a 2nd time some days (usually summer days) for it to really work (which I think it does). Still better than all the other natural ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I use natural deodorant because I am very cautious with products that I put in or on my body. I love it and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this and it smelled great but did nothing to mask body odor. I smelled gross after a few hours of daily tasks. I ended up getting dessert essence tea tree deodorant and it works great. The accompany needs to do something to make it keep odorous down not mask it with lavender.</li>
    <li> This is right for me cause store brought deodorant break me out.  This is more healther without causing any under arm problems.</li>
    <li> Makes your armpits stick and creates this awkward musty smell. No hint of the lavender, at all. Super disappointed :-C</li>
    <li> Smells lovely, is perfect for sensitive skin and glands, but lasts 18 hours rather than 24.</li>
    <li> I have tried a couple of other alternative deodorant sticks, but none provided the protection of Jason&#x27;s without the harmful aluminum.</li>
    <li> Nice smell and texture, however it wears off pretty easily, and i am not a heavy sweater.... Crystal Rock Deodorant is much better at keeping away smells and sweat, but is unsented.</li>
    <li> First, let me say I am retired and not very active. I don&#x27;t jog, garden, or do much of anything to work up a sweat other than a little housework.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to get away from the aluminum in antiperspirants, and someone recommended this, so I purchased the 3-pack. This is the worst deodorant I have ever used. By the end of the day, I have odor that is stronger than anything I&#x27;ve ever had before. It is very bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this is worse than nothing at all. There were days that I forgot to put on deodorant, and didn&#x27;t have much odor at all! I finally decided to get rid of the 2 unused containers, along with the partial one that I can&#x27;t bring myself to finish. What a waste! On to a different brand!</li>
    <li> I also wanted to love this. I really did. I was super excited about this being paraben free and vegan. I also really love the smell. The first day I used it I was just hanging around my house and didn&#x27;t really have a bad experience with it. It is really sticky, but I was willing to live with it for the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the first day I used it at work was a disaster! I have always used Dove deodorant and have NEVER had an issue with sweating... until today. I feel like I smell gross and am actually quite embarrassed to be around anyone. I don&#x27;t have a physical job by any means but am required to move around a bit. I have done nothing even remotely strenuous and can literally smell myself. I am not impressed. I have not tried any of the other Jason deodorants so perhaps they work a bit better than this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this deodorant and it DID NOT keep me fresh as it suppose to do being a supposedly natural deodorant. I used it twice and I was smelling like a freshly cut onion, oh how disappointed and displeased I was and in addition it had my armpits a bit sticky. Thankfully I only purchased one!</li>
    <li> After the second day of trying this product, a rash broke out on both of my armpits. I have since stopped using and I&#x27;m now waiting for it to clear up.</li>
