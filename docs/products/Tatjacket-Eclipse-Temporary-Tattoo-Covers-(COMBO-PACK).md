### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and when I put sandals I need to use the cover up,and for me people it works wonderfully, to take it off</li>
      <li>I use it to blend with these temp covers and they work great together and lasts 3-5 days depending where it is used</li>
      <li>It sounds too good to be true, and it is.</li>
      <li>I have a better chance of people not noticing my tattoo because this product just makes it so much more noticeable that everyone will be staring.</li>
      <li>And it is not to easy to get off</li>
      <li>But, it worked fine for an event I had where I needed to cover up for a gala.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I applied it correctly.</li>
      <li>Better to get real make up instead of this.</li>
      <li>the product is ok if you dont have to use the whole sheet because it don&#x27;t seem to stay on it</li>
      <li>in second place it looked nice and aesthetic.</li>
      <li>first place the cover protected the area from the sun&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I really only find that I can use 1 of the many colors.  </li>
      <li>It pretty much is a temporary tattoo (like the kind you got as a kid and would apply by wet it to your skin).</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t cover very well</li>
      <li>I really like the concealer</li>
      <li>To further frustrate, applying pressure did not reattach said sheet, but attempts to peel it off were poor at best as the sheet was still sticky.  </li>
      <li>Although the application was easy they need more instructions on how best to apply, you don&#x27;t want to move the area to apply,  you want to stretch the skin if a wrist area and wait for it to dry, also once dried very difficult to remove with soap or baby oil.  </li>
      <li>Theres no blending or matching skin because the colors it comes in aren&#x27;t even realistic to anyone&#x27;s skin tone.</li>
      <li>It actually made the area I was trying to hide more noticable because now I had a big white square on my arm.</li>
      <li>The instructions suggest applying a second coat to address the bleed through, but with the poor quality of the first application, adding a second layer only served to make it more sticky/</li>
      <li>If you were to have a sheet of paper, and watered it soaked and placed it over your skin, that is how these Tatjackets look when applied except not pale white...</li>
      <li>I figure I&#x27;d have to use several covers to get anywhere near my shade</li>
      <li>It did at least provide a smooth and faded enough surface that I could use concealer to cover the rest of the way.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s misleading because you think that the color on the border of the tattoo is the color that will appear on you skin, wrong, the color on the main part (which for all of them is pretty much a variation of white) is what sticks to your skin, which obviously does not match your skin or make your old tattoo &amp;#34;disappear&amp;#34;.</li>

<li> And although there are several choices for colors there not a real match, and only two of each choice so after two you need to reorder..</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t hide tattoos at all, just leaves and odd looking white patch over it.</li>
<li> Total waste of money, it does not cover at all, looks like a see thru bandaid.</li>
<li> I should&#x27;ve lstened to other reviews</li>
<li> Does not work well with dark skin.</li>
<li> just peels off and after a few days or wear the product</li>
<li> Not satisfied at all.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t believe I wasted my money on this!</li>
<li> but instead it&#x27;s a VERY pale version of it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed with the purchase, I had high hopes for it.</li>
<li> I would not recommend this to anyone who needs serious cover up for a tattoo.</li>
<li> It also cracks right away and just looks terrible.</li>
<li> PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
<li> These immediately crack after being applied and failed to cover my tattoo.</li>
<li> Worst money ever spent.</li>
<li> The worst part is that it doesnt even fully hide a dark tattoo under it.</li>
<li> At the wedding I tried to cover it up at everyone kept asking if I had a skin condition it looked so bad.</li>
<li> Worst Cover up experience of my life!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not goddess at all. When applied it looks wrinkled &amp; cracked. Waist of my money. Don&#x27;t recommend at all.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t cover my tattoo</li>
    <li> Did not work correctly and then took forever to get off! Not satisfied at all. At the wedding I tried to cover it up at everyone kept asking if I had a skin condition it looked so bad.</li>
    <li> I got this to cover a hip tattoo for an outfit I was wearing so that it wouldn&#x27;t show. I thought that the color on the border would be what would actually be applied - but instead it&#x27;s a VERY pale version of it. I figure I&#x27;d have to use several covers to get anywhere near my shade but I only had the sample combo pack. I wound up scrubbing it off and just using tattoo makeup concealer. I&#x27;m disappointed with the purchase, I had high hopes for it.</li>
    <li> does n ot match skin at all, and even doing two sheets still show tattoo</li>
    <li> this is the biggest joke ever!! I should&#x27;ve lstened to other reviews I can&#x27;t believe I wasted my money on this! would give ZERO stars if i could!!! PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I applied it correctly. It pretty much is a temporary tattoo (like the kind you got as a kid and would apply by wet it to your skin). It&#x27;s misleading because you think that the color on the border of the tattoo is the color that will appear on you skin, wrong, the color on the main part (which for all of them is pretty much a variation of white) is what sticks to your skin, which obviously does not match your skin or make your old tattoo &amp;#34;disappear&amp;#34;. It actually made the area I was trying to hide more noticable because now I had a big white square on my arm.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t cover very well</li>
    <li> Total waste of money, it does not cover at all, looks like a see thru bandaid. I just threw them away!</li>
    <li> Although the application was easy they need more instructions on how best to apply, you don&#x27;t want to move the area to apply,  you want to stretch the skin if a wrist area and wait for it to dry, also once dried very difficult to remove with soap or baby oil.  And although there are several choices for colors there not a real match, and only two of each choice so after two you need to reorder..</li>
    <li> I have a tattoo on my foot and I have to cover it for work and when I put sandals I need to use the cover up,and for me people it works wonderfully, to take it off I use alcohol, it stays on too for a couple of days,</li>
    <li> colors are soooooooooo off, wont match any skin color at all.</li>
    <li> Lots of colors so I really only find that I can use 1 of the many colors.  But, it worked fine for an event I had where I needed to cover up for a gala.</li>
    <li> the product is ok if you dont have to use the whole sheet because it don&#x27;t seem to stay on it just peels off and after a few days or wear the product makes rhe area sticky on big ares</li>
    <li> If 0 stars was an option thats what I&#x27;d have picked. This product is just a beige temporary tattoo. Theres no blending or matching skin because the colors it comes in aren&#x27;t even realistic to anyone&#x27;s skin tone. I have a better chance of people not noticing my tattoo because this product just makes it so much more noticeable that everyone will be staring. The worst part is that it doesnt even fully hide a dark tattoo under it. Worst money ever spent.</li>
    <li> I really like the concealer I use it to blend with these temp covers and they work great together and lasts 3-5 days depending where it is used</li>
    <li> Regarding the color listings: I applied &amp;#34;tan,&amp;#34; and in actuality the cover pad&#x27;s color is &amp;#34;fair.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the longevity of the product: I followed the instructions given on the back of every sheet.  The tattoo bled through and within five minutes the sheet began to peel away (think sunburn peel).  To further frustrate, applying pressure did not reattach said sheet, but attempts to peel it off were poor at best as the sheet was still sticky.  The instructions suggest applying a second coat to address the bleed through, but with the poor quality of the first application, adding a second layer only served to make it more sticky/gooey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I am thoroughly dissatisfied with this product and would give it zero stars were such possible.</li>
    <li> I had an injury and a doctor will remove it with lasser&lt;br /&gt;in two months, but for my vacations I had the problem&lt;br /&gt;of a temporary scar. The product worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;In first place the cover protected the area from the sun&lt;br /&gt;and in second place it looked nice and aesthetic.</li>
    <li> None of the colors were my color and I had a gala to attend and it took everything I had in the medicine cabinet to get it off before the gala. Worst Cover up experience of my life! Plus, it had wrinkles in it and it was on my upper arm so every time I moved my arm you could see it wrinkle up and it looked gross.</li>
    <li> This product does not work like the description says or the pictures show. It doesn&#x27;t hide tattoos at all, just leaves and odd looking white patch over it. It basically looks like the adhesive is stronger than the cover-up material. It also cracks right away and just looks terrible. I would not recommend this to anyone who needs serious cover up for a tattoo.</li>
    <li> Does not work well with dark skin. Better to get real make up instead of this. And it is not to easy to get off</li>
    <li> If you were to have a sheet of paper, and watered it soaked and placed it over your skin, that is how these Tatjackets look when applied except not pale white... The matching of skin color was acceptable but the texture and overall appearance just does not work out</li>
    <li> These immediately crack after being applied and failed to cover my tattoo. It did at least provide a smooth and faded enough surface that I could use concealer to cover the rest of the way. It sounds too good to be true, and it is.</li>
