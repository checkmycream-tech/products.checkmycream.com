### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This product is also great because it doesn&#x27;t have a scent to it!</li>
      <li>All BWC products I&#x27;ve tried are excellent.</li>
      <li>The sunscreen is zinc, so be prepared for that while look after you apply it...not really attractive.</li>
      <li>Great sun protection.</li>
      <li>Great product and</li>
      <li>My skin looks great</li>
      <li>BWC is an amazing line of products and the CoQ10 with Vitamin C face lotion is the best I&#x27;ve tried for years.</li>
      <li>She really liked it, so now I need to get another bottle for myself and her too!</li>
      <li>Still, BWC makes a great product and this sunscreen made the EWG&#x27;s list for safe sunscreens, so I will use it up!</li>
      <li>Nothing so good</li>
      <li>but without the SPF, for a good night face cream.</li>
      <li>It is a great moisturizer with SPF, but most of all I like the company because there is no testing  on animals.</li>
      <li>Love this moisturizer !  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Seems more like a zinc sunscreen than  moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I use the BWC Vitamin C with CoQ10 moisturizer (sans sunscreen) at night, and I love it.</li>
      <li>I love how protective this cream is.</li>
      <li>I love the Beauty Without Cruelty SPF 15 lotion</li>
      <li>I love all bwc products, except this one.</li>
      <li>Seems to be more of a sunscreen than a moisturizer or skin softening agent.</li>
      <li>Not the best for under makeup, but I was overall satisfied.</li>
      <li>The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because it is best used during the day because of the SPF protection.</li>
      <li>so I know it is safe for me and my kids.</li>
      <li>and I love it,</li>
      <li>BWC makes an EXCELLENT one called Beauty Without Cruelty Organic Vitamin C With Coq10 Facial Renewal Cream.</li>
      <li>Coq10 SPF 17 lotion is good but doesn&#x27;t blend in very well.</li>
      <li>Seems to do the job and not wash off easily.</li>
      <li>and Vitamin C keep my skin smooth and taut.</li>
      <li>This fit the bill.</li>
      <li>The BWC facial lotion is great.  </li>
      <li>so I was excited to find this product.</li>
      <li>The texture of it might work okay for a hike, but the spf 17 doesn&#x27;t really cut it for hiking.</li>
      <li>It is a good facial lotion.</li>
      <li>I love BWC normally, but not this one.</li>
      <li>I ended up giving this one to my sister because she has very sensitive skin and most lotions sting her.</li>
      <li>It feels more like I&#x27;m putting on old liquid foundation.</li>
      <li>so finding the right products is tricky.</li>
      <li>My skin absolutely LOVES it!</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased the moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>And the sunscreen mixed with the natural oil gives my skin a nice glow when I&#x27;ve been in the sun for an extended period of time.</li>
      <li>and I know I&#x27;m keeping myself healthy in the long run.</li>
      <li>it is so cool that it is environmentally sensitive and not toxic to people...</li>
      <li>but as you keep rubbing it clears up and feels really moisturized</li>
      <li>I have purchased two types of cleanser in the past and was very pleased with both.  </li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>It IS thick, but it really evens out your skin tone and is great for people with dry or sensitive skin - I have both!</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and so far, it is not clogging pores or causing breakouts.</li>
      <li>It does not spread easily onto skin and makes skin look ghostly pale.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s greasy, like, really greasy, and goes on chalk white.</li>
      <li>have sensitive to combination skin and cystic acne</li>
      <li>I would recommend to anyone who wants simply to improve their skin routine.&lt;br</li>
      <li>formula is thick (thanks to the SPF 17) and may clump makeup if layered before mostly absorbed; I&#x27;ve found I&#x27;m using less makeup as the lotion has a bit of tint to it after it has set.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> The sunscreen ingredient makes it nearly impossible to spread on your face.</li>
<li> so I was really disappointed with this one.</li>

    <li> I bought this and I really like it. It is a good facial lotion. Not the best for under makeup, but I was overall satisfied. I ended up giving this one to my sister because she has very sensitive skin and most lotions sting her. She really liked it, so now I need to get another bottle for myself and her too!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a facial lotion that won&#x27;t break out my skin, has SPF, and no harmful chemicals (like fragrance or parabens). This checks all those boxes. My skin looks great and I know I&#x27;m keeping myself healthy in the long run. I&#x27;ll be using this for years.</li>
    <li> Heavy, unpleasant, and pasty white. It does not spread easily onto skin and makes skin look ghostly pale. I will not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Very thick moisturizer, but I feel like it&#x27;s actually protecting my face when I put it on.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It is a great moisturizer with SPF, but most of all I like the company because there is no testing  on animals.</li>
    <li> This B W C Vitamin C with Coq10 SPF 17 lotion is good but doesn&#x27;t blend in very well. I walk around with a white face.</li>
    <li> Seems to do the job and not wash off easily. I found the consistency to be a little thick and hard to spread out. Seems to be more of a sunscreen than a moisturizer or skin softening agent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really thick when you first put it on but as you keep rubbing it clears up and feels really moisturized</li>
    <li> All BWC products I&#x27;ve tried are excellent.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased the moisturizer.  I have purchased two types of cleanser in the past and was very pleased with both.  I try to purchase products made with organic ingredients that are not tested on animals and contain no parabens or thalates.  This fit the bill.</li>
    <li> Great sun protection. It is Zinc based so it only takes a little and is hard to rub in, especially with facial hair. Therefore I do not use it as every day lotion, just as a facial sunblock. Great product and it is so cool that it is environmentally sensitive and not toxic to people... I learned of the product on the Environmental Working Groups website so I know it is safe for me and my kids.</li>
    <li> I have the BWC moisturizer and I love it, so I was excited to find this product. I like it and will definitely use it throughout the summer, but it is heavier/greasier than I expected. Still, BWC makes a great product and this sunscreen made the EWG&#x27;s list for safe sunscreens, so I will use it up!</li>
    <li> I have dry/combination skin on my face, but BWC keeps my skin moisturized all day. And the sunscreen mixed with the natural oil gives my skin a nice glow when I&#x27;ve been in the sun for an extended period of time. I hope BWC never stops making this product. My skin absolutely LOVES it!</li>
    <li> This is a very heavy moisturizer, very heavy. It&#x27;s thick and feels a bit greasy. The sunscreen is zinc, so be prepared for that while look after you apply it...not really attractive. The texture of it might work okay for a hike, but the spf 17 doesn&#x27;t really cut it for hiking. Not really usable for a daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Seems more like a zinc sunscreen than  moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t rub in. I love BWC normally, but not this one.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this, I just can&#x27;t. I use the BWC Vitamin C with CoQ10 moisturizer (sans sunscreen) at night, and I love it. I thought, hey, why not add SPF to the mix? So I looked into combining my efforts and unfortunately I am going to have to toss most of the tube. It&#x27;s greasy, like, really greasy, and goes on chalk white. Your makeup will not blend well over it, and there isn&#x27;t enough powder in the world to cover up the shine. You can try though, and you&#x27;ll get zits. Well, I did. Two days wearing this (one day with makeup, one day without) and I looked like a zitty teenager again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it smells like sunscreen. Like, that touristy, let&#x27;s-go-to-the-beach smell that you might get at say, Disney World. So it&#x27;s greasy, gives me zits, leaves me pasty white, and smells like tourist... and it&#x27;s only SPF 17 to boot! I&#x27;m sorry BWC, I&#x27;m a big fan of your products, but this one needs to be reformulated.</li>
    <li> I have been using for about a month--I got the recommendation from the EWG. I have very sensitive skin, and so far, it is not clogging pores or causing breakouts. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love how protective this cream is. The SPF ingredients protect me from the sun and the COQ10 and Vitamin C keep my skin smooth and taut. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because it is best used during the day because of the SPF protection. It just feels weird putting on a sunscreen product at night. I would recommend using a different cream that still has the Vitamin C and COQ10 but without the SPF, for a good night face cream. BWC makes an EXCELLENT one called Beauty Without Cruelty Organic Vitamin C With Coq10 Facial Renewal Cream. Check it out! ;)</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is not very moisturizing. When I put it on, it has a chalky residue. I love the Beauty Without Cruelty SPF 15 lotion so I was really disappointed with this one. It&#x27;s not the worst lotion, but it&#x27;s definitely not the best. I probably won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This does NOT moisturize my skin. My face is flaking all over, especially my cheeks and forehead. It feels like I&#x27;m putting some sort of paste all over my face. It doesn&#x27;t have that silky smoothness that you expect from a lotion. It feels more like I&#x27;m putting on old liquid foundation. NOT GOOD! Please avoid this product.</li>
    <li> Hard to apply but then it does have sunscreen in it.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer !  I only wish it didn&#x27;t go on so white.</li>
    <li> I wasted money on this. Nothing so good</li>
    <li> I love all bwc products, except this one. The sunscreen ingredient makes it nearly impossible to spread on your face. I have to mix this with other face moisturizer to get it on.</li>
    <li> BWC is an amazing line of products and the CoQ10 with Vitamin C face lotion is the best I&#x27;ve tried for years. I would recommend to anyone who wants simply to improve their skin routine.&lt;br /&gt;The formula is thick (thanks to the SPF 17) and may clump makeup if layered before mostly absorbed; I&#x27;ve found I&#x27;m using less makeup as the lotion has a bit of tint to it after it has set.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive to combination skin and cystic acne so finding the right products is tricky. Since using this lotion I&#x27;ve had reduced flare ups while staying hydrated all the while.</li>
    <li> Sorry, I could not tell any difference after using. Will not buy again. Total waste of money, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> The BWC facial lotion is great.  It IS thick, but it really evens out your skin tone and is great for people with dry or sensitive skin - I have both! This product is also great because it doesn&#x27;t have a scent to it! I&#x27;m not a fan of facial lotions that attract bugs because of how they smell! This one doesn&#x27;t!</li>
