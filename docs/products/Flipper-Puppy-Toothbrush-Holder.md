      <li>These are wonderful for traveling and easy for kids to use.  </li>
      <li>The suction works best on mirrors and doesn&#x27;t slide off easily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the &amp;#34;Flipper&amp;#34; - My son loves this one for his toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The puppy toothbrush holder is very cute.</li>
      <li>A great clean way to store your toothbrush!</li>
      <li>The kids love them, too!</li>
      <li>Functional, durable and cute!</li>
      <li>I love the toothbrush holder!</li>
      <li>Would be a nice stocking stuffer for kids.</li>
      <li>My kids love them.</li>
      <li>and it sure looked alot like mine, but it couldn&#x27;t be- because everyone loves it....</li>
      <li>We love these toothbrush holders.  </li>
      <li>Adorable love it</li>
      <li>Really happy with my purchase, my son loves his doggie friend holding his toothbrush for him, thank you so much</li>
      <li>Although I know these were designed for children, I&#x27;ve given them to more adults than kids.  </li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re really cute.</li>
      <li>-(so says the banner at the top, provided by amazon-love that feature)</li>
      <li>absolutely adorable...</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Now I clean the holders once a week by using warm water and soap.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my girlfriend because I purchased a similar one in Israel and when she moved in, she would just rest her toothbrush on top of my dog-holder, so I bought her this one to symbolically welcome into my house.</li>
      <li>Be sure to clean it as it will mold if you leave it</li>
      <li>It attached easily to the mirror.  </li>
      <li>Works smoothly, my son loves it</li>
      <li>It is a guaranteed smile!</li>
      <li>If you want to keep your kids toothbrushes clean and out of the way...you want this product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not the smartest way to clean them.</li>
      <li>The description says it is great for traveling, but it won&#x27;t stay closed!</li>
      <li>It opens and closes very easily even for my two-year old.  </li>
      <li>well made fun to use</li>
      <li>Make sure you clean it every so often because whatever water and toothpaste is left on your brush will drip and get stuck inside, which can then lead to mold.</li>
      <li>They open and close very easily and keep the toothbrush sanitary.</li>
      <li>I have bought several styles as gifts and they are all cute and durable.</li>
      <li>The first time, I ruined the holders by boiling them and allowing the plastic to morph.</li>
      <li>This is not a problem for us, because my toddler is able to use it himself,  which makes him feel like a big boy.</li>
      <li>But sure enough, I click on it and</li>
      <li>, I have tried many, I am back looking again for a way to hold my tooth brush, keep it sanitary, and not have it sitting in a brush holder on the counter that eventually gets gunky inside the bottom.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Keeps things off the counter top (limited counter space in my bathroom)&lt;br /&gt;Closes around the toothbrush (cleanliness)&lt;br /&gt;Still has vents</li>
      <li>this is the very puppy holder, the one that fell off the tile, then fell off the wall, then fell off the mirror.</li>
      <li>The only problem would be for some people is it doesn&#x27;t close securely.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s played   with by a 3 year old,who now wants to brush his teeth all the time.  </li>
      <li>its the very one I bought</li>
      <li>While chairing a committee to raise money for a new Children&#x27;s Hospital, I handed these out at the first meeting.  </li>
      <li>One can cover a tooth brush near a toilet while enticing a child to brush with the cute design.</li>
      <li>7 year old loves it easy to use sticks well to the mirror its simple and  </li>
      <li>The concept of this tooth brush cover is clever.</li>
      <li>I purchased this cute little toothbrush holder to hold my daughter&#x27;s tooth brush.</li>
      <li>- I tried the smallest brush thinking my super brush with the big head was maybe a bit heavy (giving the dog too much credit, but he was cute), but no, it didn&#x27;t matter if I left it empty, eventually in the night I would hear the clink-clink of the puppy falling from wherever it was.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad for everyone who seems to have no problem with it staying up for for those who don&#x27;t mind laying it on the counter, but I truly do not know how all of these people got it to stay on the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a strong suction holding it,it has never fell down.</li>
      <li>I saw the 5 stars on this brand and new</li>
      <li>I wanted the committee to think about the children &#x27;first thing in the morning, and last thing at night&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves this.</li>
      <li>I had a similar one for about 5 minutes last yr or the year before, but thought this one must be different or new because it was rated so high - and mine went right in the garbage by the end of a week.  </li>
      <li>you really have to place it on a mirror or other glass surface for it to stick really well.  </li>
      <li>My only problem - not really a complaint because the packaging does specify this -</li>

    <li> We have a small bathroom and not a lot of counter space.  This is a great idea, in my opinion, got that reason alone.  I also like that it keeps the brushes away from the germs and ant splatter from the sink.  The kids love them, too!</li>
    <li> Great gift!  These are wonderful for traveling and easy for kids to use.  They open and close very easily and keep the toothbrush sanitary. The only problem is they do have a tendency to open exposing toothbrush sometimes if not packed properly. I have bought several styles as gifts and they are all cute and durable.</li>
    <li> Functional, durable and cute!</li>
    <li> This turned out to be a great purchase.  It opens and closes very easily even for my two-year old.

My only problem - not really a complaint because the packaging does specify this - you really have to place it on a mirror or other glass surface for it to stick really well.  On our tile, it falls off too often.  Unfortunately, the mirror is too far for the two-year old to reach.</li>

    <li> The concept of this tooth brush cover is clever. One can cover a tooth brush near a toilet while enticing a child to brush with the cute design. Unfortunately this dog&#x27;s arm broke off in the first five minutes without dropping it or anything. This caused my 7-year-old to cry. Unfortunate.</li>
    <li> If you want to keep your kids toothbrushes clean and out of the way...you want this product.&lt;br /&gt;It sticks on the mirror and is teriffic!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the &amp;#34;Flipper&amp;#34; - My son loves this one for his toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Keeps things off the counter top (limited counter space in my bathroom)&lt;br /&gt;Closes around the toothbrush (cleanliness)&lt;br /&gt;Still has vents so the toothbrush can dry thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None!</li>
    <li> I purchased this cute little toothbrush holder to hold my daughter&#x27;s tooth brush. The description says it is great for traveling, but it won&#x27;t stay closed! I am really disappointed that the product does not perform as the description stays closed. I am not going to pack this for a trip because the toothbrush will fall out!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend because I purchased a similar one in Israel and when she moved in, she would just rest her toothbrush on top of my dog-holder, so I bought her this one to symbolically welcome into my house. It is very cute and functional, and I was really happy with it when I got it.</li>
    <li> Be sure to clean it as it will mold if you leave it shut all the time.</li>
    <li> The puppy toothbrush holder is very cute. It attached easily to the mirror.  There&#x27;s a strong suction holding it,it has never fell down. It&#x27;s played   with by a 3 year old,who now wants to brush his teeth all the time.  He has a cars toothbrush that he says he parks in his puppy gargage.  The only problem would be for some people is it doesn&#x27;t close securely.  This is not a problem for us, because my toddler is able to use it himself,  which makes him feel like a big boy.</li>
    <li> 7 year old loves it easy to use sticks well to the mirror its simple and  well made fun to use</li>
    <li> absolutely adorable...BUT they do not stay put.  There&#x27;s no way around it, I have tried many, I am back looking again for a way to hold my tooth brush, keep it sanitary, and not have it sitting in a brush holder on the counter that eventually gets gunky inside the bottom. I saw the 5 stars on this brand and new I had a similar one for about 5 minutes last yr or the year before, but thought this one must be different or new because it was rated so high - and mine went right in the garbage by the end of a week.  I saw the puppy and it sure looked alot like mine, but it couldn&#x27;t be- because everyone loves it....But sure enough, I click on it and its the very one I bought -(so says the banner at the top, provided by amazon-love that feature) this is the very puppy holder, the one that fell off the tile, then fell off the wall, then fell off the mirror. I decided to finally write a review because I cannot believe that nobody else had this problem and people should be warned at least by one person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep a stash of toothbrushes, because I rotate from hard to medium to soft - I tried the smallest brush thinking my super brush with the big head was maybe a bit heavy (giving the dog too much credit, but he was cute), but no, it didn&#x27;t matter if I left it empty, eventually in the night I would hear the clink-clink of the puppy falling from wherever it was.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad for everyone who seems to have no problem with it staying up for for those who don&#x27;t mind laying it on the counter, but I truly do not know how all of these people got it to stay on the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have a dozen and switch them based on my mood if they did what they are supposed to do</li>
    <li> Adorable love it and it works great!</li>
    <li> We got wo of these. What a great idea!  They work welll snap open and closed well and they&#x27;re really cute. My kids love them.</li>
    <li> We love these toothbrush holders.  Great for home and travel</li>
    <li> I actually use this to store my dog&#x27;s toothbrush, so the opening is a bit small (I can&#x27;t close the housing area completely with the dog toothbrush inside) for a typical dog toothbrush that is larger and angled, but it does the job. The colors are a bit chipped too, so not the greatest quality, but satisfactory.</li>
    <li> Received as expected in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> My son loves this toothbrush holder, sticks to the mirror in the bathroom, keeps toothbrush out of the sink. Would be a nice stocking stuffer for kids.</li>
    <li> I love the toothbrush holder! This is the 2nd time I bought these cuties. The first time, I ruined the holders by boiling them and allowing the plastic to morph. Not the smartest way to clean them. :) Now I clean the holders once a week by using warm water and soap. The suction works best on mirrors and doesn&#x27;t slide off easily. A great clean way to store your toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Works smoothly, my son loves it</li>
    <li> I have a tiny bathroom in an NYC apartment.  There isn&#x27;t any room on the sink for anything, so this at least helps by getting my toothbrush out of the way.  Make sure you clean it every so often because whatever water and toothpaste is left on your brush will drip and get stuck inside, which can then lead to mold.</li>
    <li> My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves this. it stays suctioned, and holds the tooth brush perfectly and is very cute!</li>
    <li> Really happy with my purchase, my son loves his doggie friend holding his toothbrush for him, thank you so much</li>
