      <li>However, the scent is a little strong and sweet for my taste, although the scent is not at all offensive or overly feminine -- just tropical, a bit like sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if the bottle still mentions this, but LESS IS MORE with this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>A thin layer will not only make each bottle last forever, but it also gives you the best shave.</li>
      <li>:) IMO, The cream actually gives a closer shave than less natural shaving \\&quot;creams\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that it is a bit light in consistency and disappears too quickly.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought a tube of Alba coconut lime shave cream on the half price shelf in a Safeway in Middleburg VA.  </li>
      <li>you can get at the trader&#x27;s near you.</li>
      <li>It lasts for a long time, you don&#x27;t need much at all; It has reduced the amount of nicks you get while shaving legs and arms.</li>
      <li>It is very creamy and doesn&#x27;t have the chemicals that cause other products to foam.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite shaving cream.  He prefers it over everything else.  I have used it for shaving my legs.  It does a great job, helps give you a close shave, leaves your skin conditioned and soft.  However, the scent is a little strong and sweet for my taste, although the scent is not at all offensive or overly feminine -- just tropical, a bit like sunscreen.  I just prefer no scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Environmental Working Group cosmetics database gives this stuff a 4, which is a fair rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware Trader Joe&#x27;s version of this shaving cream.  The container looks the same, but if you read the ingredients, it is NOT the same stuff.  The Trader Joe&#x27;s version uses more chemicals that one should avoid.</li>
    <li> This is the best shave cream for sensitive skin.  I have tried countless gels, foams, creams, etc.  None have made shaving easier or had better results.  That simple.  Also - Fast Shipping.</li>
    <li> I originally bought a tube of Alba coconut lime shave cream on the half price shelf in a Safeway in Middleburg VA.  This was on the way home to Fallingwater area for my usual Christmas break.  I started using the Alba for my daily shave and was amazed by the comfort and closeness of the shave.  By the time the holidays were over, I was a convert.  It is now more than two years later and I am a devoteed convert.  My only complaint is that it is a bit light in consistency and disappears too quickly.  But I get another tube to continue the saga of the well kept cheek.  Bravo, Alba!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect this product to have the same texture as typical shaving cream.  It is very creamy and doesn&#x27;t have the chemicals that cause other products to foam.  Works great for both my husband and me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years.  I have an issue with certain products affecting my skin(sensitive skin).  However, I have never had a problem.  My younger son(20) uses it too and he does not complain.  If it was not good he would definitely complain.</li>
    <li> Works well, smells good, keeps my skin nice and irritation-free.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could have gotten a smaller pack, but at least I have a lifetime supply now!&lt;br /&gt;Alba suggests you use this sparingly, and I agree. It doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
    <li> Have tried these in Mango Vanilla and Coconut Lime and am super happy with the product. Both smell amazing; I am buying in bulk and alternating fragrances. :) IMO, The cream actually gives a closer shave than less natural shaving \\&quot;creams\\&quot;. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> YOU WILL NEVER HAVE RAZOR BURN. A LITTLE BIT GOES A LONG, LONG WAY. USE WITH GILLETTE THROW AWAY RAZOR.</li>
    <li> This gives a wonderful close shave. I feel so soft and smooth after. I don&#x27;t know if the bottle still mentions this, but LESS IS MORE with this product. A thin layer will not only make each bottle last forever, but it also gives you the best shave. This isn&#x27;t one of those shaving products that foams up as it comes out and that took a bit for me to get used to but now I much prefer it.</li>
    <li> Not good. Maybe it would be good if you havent tried he Kiss my Face shaving cream. Once you have tried the Kiss my Face shaving cream nothing is better. The alba smelled awesome. But you had to use a ton of it, and it wasent very slick.&lt;br /&gt;Again go for the Kiss my Face, much better product. I have personally used it for years, and occasionally I try something else, but always go back to the Kiss my Face.</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic; feels like I am in the tropics! Better than normal shave cremes for smoothness of shaving and is all natural and or organic to the face and body at a better price! How can you beat that combination? I&#x27;ll keep using in the future.</li>
    <li> Alba revised the formulation of this in 2012 or 2013, and it&#x27;s no better than the knock off copy you can get at the trader&#x27;s near you. ALBA -- go back to the better quality you used to make!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Love the scent and my skin is so soft after every use.</li>
    <li> There is nothing like this product on the market - if you do know of something I&#x27;d Love to know.</li>
    <li> I like and use Alba shaving cream. However Mango Vanilla smells sickening-sweet to me. The good news is that my teenage daughter likes it (for shaving her legs), so I gave it to her.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to foams.  We use a wet/dry electric shaver and this is a great product to smooth over face before shaving. A staple in our cabinet!</li>
    <li> I Highly recommend this product. It lasts for a long time, you don&#x27;t need much at all; It has reduced the amount of nicks you get while shaving legs and arms. The scent of this is fabulous. I will never use a can again. I bought several at one time and the cost was fantastic. I can&#x27;t say enough about this brand. Legs feel very smooth after using this.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product and I like the way it smells on him!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a shaving cream that makes NO foam (Zero, Zilch, Nada). I found It! Very smooth. NO Cuts.</li>
