<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The best purchase process i have ever made!!Arrived long time before i expected it!!+ the products are great and go on smooth!!I love doing makeovers on my mom and friends so i get to flaunt my makeup!!LOL!!Shiny and the rule that i love in MAKEUP is defenitly applied here!!A little does go a long way!The makeup was wrapped well and i was so excited to show my mom the makeup!!Now she comes in everyday and asks me to do her makeup LOL!!</li>
    <li> I Received them a couple of days ago and it gos on so smooth and the color is great easy to blend too and shimmery but not to exaggerated. They come in small bottles as shown which is kinda annoying but worth it for the price but the quality is great. I put it on with Urban Decay Primer, stays fresh all day.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SET ITS EVEN BETTER IF U APPLY PRIMER ITS A MUST AND I LOVE TO PUT WATER OR EYEDROPS AND MIX THEM SO THE COLOR CAN POP U WILL GET A LOT OF COLORS AND THE GLITTERS R SO BEAUTIFUL THEY WORK WELL IF U USE CLEAR LIPGLOSS THEN A STIFF MAKEUP BRUSH AND PAT ON</li>
    <li> First of all I wanna say I love Nyx cosmetics its worth the $60 really. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating is because the brush that comes with it is very CHEAP!!! The moment I took it out of the package it had fallen apart. You would think it would be in better shape after what your paying. Not m.a.c quality of course but even the cheap brushes you can get at walmart or target are better. But hey I rather pay $60 for a set of 40 eyeshadows than 2.99 each  at a beauty supply store where I live so its a steel!</li>
    <li> I received my order really fast..good thing. The colors are wonderful and I love the glitter selections. Like a lot of the reviewers have made mention, the bottles are really small..looks a lot bigger online but oh well..it is good for traveling I will take it to events where I do not want to carry an entire large kit. The pigments are great and stay on all day. I am African American and the color stayed on all day without primer, which is a great thing.</li>
    <li> The quality of these eye pigments is excellent - sticks well to eyelid without dropping tons of little pieces onto your cheeks. However, many of the colors look the same when applied. For example, there are three shades of gold/bronze/brown that look different in the container, but go on as exactly the same color. I think this is because there is so much pearl in the pigments that the color doesn&#x27;t come through as well. Also the blues, pinks, lilacs/purples, grey/silver/blacks, they all are very similar on the eyelid.     It&#x27;s the same thing with the glitters - several of them have the same mix of pink/gold/green/blue/silver pieces, so they pretty much look the same when applied. Although very pigmented, the color of the pigments are overpowered by the pieces of glitter and don&#x27;t show up very well.     I don&#x27;t regret this purchase, but if you are expecting to get 40 very different colors, that is not the case.</li>
    <li> I received this bundle a little over a week ago and  i am verrry impressed! All of thr colors are very unique and go on so smoothly. They all blend together so well. I got all of these for a fantatic price as well! I highly recommened this as a uture buy for anyone!</li>
    <li> Having spent high school in the midst of the True Colors fanaticism, 15-year-old me was quite excited to come across a bundle deal like this. I always liked the loose powder shadows, and the ones I bought in high school lasted forever. If I recall correctly, they ran about $10 or so for a pack of 6, and I think the volume was about equal...so being over 10 years later, the price is pretty great. I had expected the containers to be slightly larger, but a little goes a long way with this stuff, so it should last quite awhile.    As others have said, the included brush doesn&#x27;t fit into the bottle, but mini brushes do. I cannot say I have a use for all the colors (bright orange? really?), but maybe with some creative blending they will find their purpose. Halloween is an annual thing, after all.</li>
    <li> The top holes are too small that you can&#x27;t fit a brush in. You have to pour some blush into a small container, and waste the rest that you don&#x27;t use. As far a pigment, some colors are great and last all night; others are too light and fade away easily. Hit or miss I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I received, they gave me 3 different colors because they were out of stock. Wish they would have emailed me before asking which colors I wanted instead. Because I really wanted the bright orange and didn&#x27;t get it. :/</li>
    <li> I used to model quite a bit. Now I am happy being a mom and working a corporate job. I was looking for a makeup that I could use on a regular basis without paying an arm, leg and baby toe for it and this was it. It gives me the same quality that I can use whether I am walking down the runway or walking down the hallway off the elevator. I am in love with my eyeshadow and love all the different looks that I can do with them. I am not really a fan of the glitter but the restassists in giving me the desired look that I want that changes from day to day.</li>
    <li> It is very hard to get the shadow out of the tubes since the hole is so small. The shadow does not stay on well unless you use a primer or vaseline and I also mix the shadow wit mac fix finishing spray and that seems to hold very well. The colors are amazing, now I just need to find a way to make them stay on!</li>
    <li> My first purchase on Amazon.  I placed the order on Thursday and received it on Monday!!! Super fast processing and shipping!! Perfectly packaged!! It has a lot more glitter shadows than I thought but I can work with that! Would definitely buy from her again!!</li>
    <li> I was incredibly excited to receive this package of eye shadows. There is a great variety of colors, and the shadows are high quality with a gorgeous luminescence without looking too \\&quot;disco\\&quot;. The brush is cute and has very nice quality bristles. I won&#x27;t run out of eye shadow any time soon, and I got this bundle for an incredible price.</li>
    <li> These are so amazing! They are great for doing Halloween makeup or just for a casual day! They are great for any occasion! They aren&#x27;t that super messy and they are easy to remove with some makeup remover or just water. The brush is also super cute, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for this kind of makeup just because the brush is to big and narrow. I recommend a pencil brush or something skinnier. Hope this helped :)!</li>
    <li> I odered NYX 40 pc set with brush. I did not recieve a brush with my order. It was packaged in a manila envelope with bubble wrap lining but they looked as if they were just thrown in there. I do love all the colors but I thought the glitter would be almost like a shadow or somethign and it was just glitter. The bottles were cute but almost impossible to use for eyeshadow. The packaging needs to be better and the bottles in which it come need to be more user friendly. Glitter needs to be labeled as something else, kind of misleading, made me think it was glittershadow..</li>
    <li> I purchased these as both my daughter and myself like to experiment with colors and these have turned out to be just what we needed. I do suggest that you also purchase the eye shadow primer if you want the colors to be a vivid as they are in the bottles. Do be careful in handling, opening, and storing these or you will lose excess amounts of powder as these are loose powders and tend to cling to the lid and lid threads. Once you open one, you might want to use an eyeshadow BRUSH to collect the excess and try to return it to the bottle and then be sure to store them upright and do not shake! I love the variety of colors, and while the bottles are small, they hold enough eye shadow powder to last for a long time. Great product if you like experimenting, or just want a wide variety of vivid and core colors!</li>
    <li> These pigments ,I know that they&#x27;re \\&quot;loose eyeshadows\\&quot; but I call them pigments :P , are so beautiful!! Better than I had expected!! I wear the colors using MAC&#x27;s mixing mediums, and they look gorgeous!! I have tried to apply them dry, and the outcome is ok. If you are a beginner or into subtly matte looks, applying them dry is easy. Just beware of fallout. But applying them wet and foiling (with mediums) only enhances the colors look! I love the vibrant colors and the glitters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few colors that are very similar, (WHEN APPLIED DRY). but when foiled (mixed with mediums), you can slightly tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As commonly known, NYX packaging is not the best... BUT it can easily be fixed by depotting them into jars. I personally love the Darice 24 jar Beading system product. It comes with 24 clear jars and they hold a little over an ounce of product. And these nyx eyeshadows fit in one of these jars perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was amazing! Great communication and easy transaction.  I strongly recommend this seller and these pigments!!</li>
    <li> Is very little and very messy lol no brush fits inside and if u spill it its jst very messy. If you have patience you will love it. I have it for over a year and I tried to use it once or twice</li>
    <li> Iv always been a fan of NYX products, However this is my first go around with their loose pearl eyeshadow. It&#x27;s long lasting and the colors are great. the only thing I would say is I got a lot more glitter then I was expecting and the powder is really hard to get out of the containers so I just dumped it out into little bead jewelry containers.</li>
    <li> im kind of a beginner to the whole makeup thing and these are simply amazing to use, they look great and are super easy to use and youtube/google have a lot of tips and tricks on how to use them, there are way more uses then just eye shadows. these are great for the money and the brush is really cutee too.  soon of the comments on here complain about it being \\&quot;messy\\&quot; and well duhhhh! its powder obviously if you&#x27;re not carefully and throw them around there are going to get everywhere.  and also some people are complaining about brushes not being able to fit, and thats another simple thing that i dont understand how someone cant figure out, to use the u need mixing trays or you can just use the cap of the pigment like i do.  if you search google you can find a lot more tips (:</li>
    <li> These are by far the BEST eyeshadow I have ever used.  The colors come in a variety of beautiful shades and effects.  From shimmery, pearlescent and glittery.  Every color under the rainbow is there including those you did not know that existed.  They are so easy to apply with a brush (not the one included since it is too large to fit in the bottles).  It goes on smoothly, evenly and the colors blend easily.  I can use these for work and play. If you want that \\&quot;stand out\\&quot; and \\&quot;look at me\\&quot; appearance, you can apply more coats and colors to get a more dramatic/glam look.  The colors last all day without any lines or oily separation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I stated before, the brush it comes with is way too big.  I use [[ASIN:B002ZQ9COM EcoTools Bamboo 6 Mini Brushes]], they are small and the perfect size to slide into each bottle instead of dumping some on a surface and wasting any of the \\&quot;magic\\&quot; dust.  :-)</li>
    <li> The colors in this palette are absolutely gorgeous and vibrant!  The wide selection of colors in every single shade look wonderful when combined or by themselves on your eyes.  The brush that came with the set is also so adorable; all my friends were so jealous when they saw it.  For the price I paid for these colors and the brush, I feel like I got a really great bargain and definitely my money&#x27;s worth and more.  Fabulous shades and easy application due to the colors each being separated into individual containers.  Came well within the estimated arrival time and great products overall.  NYX is a great brand to buy from, and good products overall.  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> i absolutely love love this make up!! the colors are so rich! and you only need a little dab and it goes a long way!! The seller was so nice and very professional! She answered all my question before shipping out this item to me! The package came super quick and in excellent condition! 5 stars all around. whoever buys this you wont be disappointed!! :)</li>
    <li> Love these colors and the price even more.  I also purchased the NYX primer and my eyes look the same as they did this morning when I applied it.  I have been to school, went to the gym and have a 2 hour work out, followed by 20min in the sauna and not even a crease very impressive! I have read all the reviews on this one and some one else is selling this same product, so let me set it straight.  These are small bottles yes, but no smaller than the ones you already have in your make-up bag, go and check, 6oz is 6oz, no surprise there.  If you are having problems with the brush VS the bottle either dip the brush on the side of top of the opening (you will see lots there) or put the lid on and turn sideways (be careful this may take some practice) it should give you just enough to apply if there is extra than tap it back into the bottle or toss it out.  If you are having a creasing problem you are using too much primer. After what I did today I should have a major crease problem, but not even close, did I mention I have very oily skin? Remember it is primer not a shade of cream eye shadow. There are lots of colors and yes you may not like them all, but that is why they show you a picture of the contents so there are no \\&quot;surprises\\&quot;. For the price you can&#x27;t beat this deal and color variety.  If some of the colors are not \\&quot;you\\&quot; than just give them to a friend and not complain, after all you did get a smokin deal here.</li>
    <li> This product is crap.  Maybe I have been spoiled by using quality powder eyeshadow.  The product has very poor pigment.  I absolutely regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I sometimes tap too much out of the bottle when I&#x27;m trying to do my make-up because the hole is too small. The colors are great I use the glitter and the regulat colors. I use a NYX eyeshadow base and its stays on great and last long. I love MAC but I love NYX as well. I honestly use these shadows more then my MAC eyeshadows, or I use them both. Great buy!!</li>
    <li> the make up I recieved was not all nyx products as picture.I was given 35 nyx eye shadow and 5 Jcats eyshadows which were of a lower quality. Also the brush was not as pictured, and very cheap in quality</li>
    <li> They are very messy to work with and I don&#x27;t find myself reaching for them at all because of the whole process that you have to do to use them. The pigmentation is okay so colors aren&#x27;t very pigmented. I wouldn&#x27;t buy all of them I would just get a few</li>
    <li> I Recieved this item a on the expected date. The brush it came with is kind of cheap. It&#x27;s good price and good quality eye shadow, good for sensitive skin and acne prone skin. Has no talc which was really nice. But i recieved a few duplicates glitters and pinks the same color. I contacted the company and havnt recieved nothing back. I guess they dont really care. So I give it a 3 star. Poor customer service. But nyx products are good. But bad customer service :(</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a few days ago and received it in the mail pretty fast. I love all the colors... not too thrilled with the glitter ones but can still used them.... the colors are so very vibrant, and blend well... even without the eyeshadow primer... the colors stood out on my skin tone (Im African American)... but it does help to have the primer... I would recommend this product to anyone who loves going for a drastic look!!!!</li>
    <li> Like all of the other reviewers I really liked what i received. The colors don&#x27;t pop as much as i expected, they aren&#x27;t ridiculously bright, This i didn&#x27;t mind because I want the shadows to blend in with my face more then consume it. I did notice that two of the black, and two of the reds looked a lot alike, almost identical.</li>
    <li> SO CONVENIENT to have these products. The price was unbeatable and yo get so much! Thanks so much for selling this!</li>
    <li> I love glitter - everything always looks better with a bit of glitter everywhere!!  The selection of colors are great although there are a few that I may never use but for the money this was an awesome deal - and fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product just to have some variety with my eyeshadows. The bad: The jars are very small. I really dont know how my brushes will fit into them when I have used most of it. They are very dusty, so BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN OPENING THEM! also use a primer before applying shadow bc they are so dusty it doesnt seem to last long but with a primer its amazing. With the sparkly ones use some kind of glitter glue bc the spartkles just fall off. The Good: Like the title says the pigment is very good. I really like the colors. As long as you use a primer or glitter glue you should have beautiful results.</li>
    <li> Let me just first thank Misspinkcat and Amazon for their exceptional product, packaging, and customer service! Over the past five years, I have spent over $10,000 on beauty products, $7,000 on make-up alone. I have purchased beauty products from almost every retailer out there and tried a versatile selection of brand name products. I guess you can say that I am a beauty queen who takes her make-up very seriously. I consider myself a pro when it comes to applying make-up, so no false advertisement here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, my husband wanted to purchase a Valentine&#x27;s Day gift for me and I knew exactly what I needed. I was looking for a complete make-up kit with the works (bright colors, product quality, price, &amp; versatility). I had researched for hours, coming across pricey and monotonous kits, until I discovered the NYX eyeshadow, lipstick, and glitter shade kits. (Now, I have used NYX products before, they have always been a fav, but I never invested in complete kits like these.)  So after reading the reviews and deciding to make a $150.00 investment with standard shipping (35 eyeshadow kit, 36 lipgloss kit, 78 eyeshadow kit, &amp; 40 eyeshadow glitter) I was excited, but nervous because of the reviews I had read about shattered eyeshadows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After waiting only four days, I received my shipment. As I carefully opened the box, I said to myself \\&quot;here we go; I really hope I don&#x27;t have to make a return due to a lemon product.\\&quot; Once the box was open, I noticed that everything was neatly placed and wrapped in bubble wrap; I was relieved and grateful all at the same time.  Now when people refer to these products as \\&quot;crack\\&quot; or \\&quot;magic dust,\\&quot; they&#x27;re not kidding.  Once I tried every color, lipgloss, bronzer, powder, and glitter dust I knew I had made a life-time investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS:&lt;br /&gt;35 pc. Eyeshadow Kit: Amazing! Glides on perfect, with a variety of colors, and last all day! Good Beginner kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;78 pc. Eyeshadow Kit: Dress-up or dress down, this kit will offer you everything you need for eyes and cheeks. Can be used for work or play!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;40 pc. Glitter Eyeshadow:  Perfect for the glam girl! Love glitter, just can&#x27;t get enough of it? Then this is a must, believe me it will be one of the best purchases you will ever make! Added Bonus: Make-up brush (too big for bottles, but is great for applying concealer or other shadows).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;36 pc. Lipgloss Kit: I especially like that these lipglosses are fragrance free because they never feel sticky, always make my lips feel smooth and shiny. Plus, great colors and will last forever! Perfect for gifts as well. Added Bonus: Free Lipgloss Bag!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;m hooked now, saving a fortune and continue to be impressed with the quality and versatility of these products, the kits are as big as they look don&#x27;t be fooled! I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase that I would recommend this to anyone who wants to look fabulous.</li>
    <li> I really really love the eye shadow. A little bit of powder goes a long way and it shows up bright and beautiful. The only downside is the jar has a very small opening, which makes it hard to get the product out but that&#x27;s not enough to lose a star lol</li>
    <li> I like NYX products. I own 3 of the eyeshadow base pencils. I saw a video regarding all of the different uses for M.A.C. pigments and decided that I wanted to buy a ton of them. When I realized that I could buy like 40 NYX pigments for the price of two M.A.C. pigments, I was excited. The shipping took 2 days and I was really happy with the product at first. When I started to mix the pigments in with mixing mediums, I noticed that a lot of went into the air instead of in the mixing medium (I have a couple of M.A.C. pigments and they are much more substantial). I have mild asthma and I always worry about what is in the air around me so that I know when to get my inhaler. Anyways, in addition to the pigment being thrown into the air, after about 15 minutes, my throat started to become scratchy and sore. I don&#x27;t know if its just my asthma or what but that was kind of disappointing for me. I just have to be a little more careful but make sure to not blow away extra pigment, always wipe it up with a damp tissue or paper towel.</li>
    <li> I have been pondering back and forth for a year now about buying myself NYX pigments (currently use only BE makeup)- but finally decided to treat myself to something and this is what it was.  I paid close to 60 bucks for 40 pigments - 30 of the loose pearl and 10 glitter ones.  Was thrilled when the package arrived 2 days earlier then the expected date.  Shipment came from AZ to MT and nothing at all was broken and I also received exactly what was in the picture including the free brush.  Love the colors a few do look to be alike but they are not (the browns).  The openeing on the containers yes are small but for 8 bucks at Walmart I got a nice bead case that fits them all in seperate screw top containers (was not all that messy transferring them took a little time though).  I actually love the brush (so far have not had to clean it so dont know how good it really is) I use body butter as a primer and the brush works perfect for a smokey look on the eyes or I use it w the black shadow like applying eye liner.  My only COMPLAINT (really just bummed) is the Glitters- Buyer beware the glitters are not eyeshadows and even say on the containers themselves that you are not to use them near the eye area.  They are just glitter, pretty glitters but thats it.  If I had known this to begin with I would have just purchased the 30 shadows for the lower price.  I will say though that they can come in use, you can mix them with clear nail polish and paint your nails with them.  I also do acrylic nails and they work just fine with the materials I use so I just mix them together and you have the glittery acrylic tiped nails.  Also I guess if you got kiddos you could make glitter glue (lol).  In the end I am so far satisified since for a BE eyeshadow I pay up to 13 bucks for .02oz and for this set I basically paid like 67 cents a piece for .06oz.  Yes messy if your not use to using loose powders but even if I buy a pressed one I break it up myself to make it a loose powder because it just goes on better for me.  Also these shadows are going to last me a long time as long as I dont spill them (still have not tried them all but am excited too), I also gave my mom a little so she can try them out so she is set for quite some time now too.</li>
    <li> Great deal on this set, love the brush that comes with it, pretty color eyeshadows however some of the colors don&#x27;t blend well and end up streaky.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing deal - i am a big fan of NYX products so when i found this i jumped on it. The colors are really beautiful, my makeup looks really nice every day and its because of these. The wide color variations allow you to do and try a bunch of different things. A little goes a long ways, i tap a pea- sized amount on my palm and sometimes its too much! (for both eyes) these work if you want to have a more subtle look or if you want a look that stands out. One tip though with this product, is when picking out your color combos, OPEN IT lol. I assumed they all looked the same as the container and i learned different. The brush it comes with is whatever, i keep it in my purse to touch up any creme eyeshadows im wearing. The eyeshadows came in decent time, in a plastic thing, undamaged and all there. BUY IT. :D</li>
    <li> Thank you for this!!! I absolutely love the colors, and I especially like how the make up blends very well! I&#x27;m not sure what the other customer means by the color fading. I have tried 9 of the colors so far and have worn the make up the whole day. The make up stayed in tacked and came off very easily with my eye make up remover when I was ready. I suggest using an eyeshadow primer I find this helps the make up go on smoother, prevents creasing and helps the make up stay on longer. Goodluck!</li>
    <li> My fiances review:    These are great eyeshadows! great variety of colors and goes on very well. The only thing is that you have to pour it out to get it on a brush. so I pour it on my little compact mirror and then use the brush. but still great!!</li>
    <li> It is worth your money shadows go a long way and the pigments show up on dark skin (yes I am a dark woman). I love the brush to really be honest!! I wish I could buy a set of those as well, it has honestly became my primary brush that I use!! Great set for great price!! I think if it was any larger in size, with all the colors you get it would have been too much for me...lol..I don&#x27;t wear make-up everyday, only when needed.</li>
    <li> I ve had this product for some time now ..1st off i had to buy to buy containers to put the shadows in because none of my brushes or the brush it came with fit inside the container. And dumping it out each time is just a waste to eye shadow. 2nd the colors are nice but it come with 10 giltters bottle i ve only used  it once for my nails otherwise shipping was good</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors at a great price. I didnt realize how small the jars are so thought I&#x27;d write it here since I didn&#x27;t notice it anywhere.   They are .06fl oz.  Its smaller but there is a lot there. Should last me a very long time!!    Quick to ship the product .. so over all very happy!</li>
    <li> I love this product. The color payoff is great. It was an amazing deal and I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I like the pigments!!! not very happy with the small size of the bottles, was exspecting bigger ones and the brush fell apart before i even took it out of the case. The shipping was quick</li>
    <li> they are a good size and really cute! i dont regret it buying this. i love the brush,i use that everyday</li>
    <li> My order came in a week ago. I was happy to revived the package also I&#x27;m happy with my purchase also. Most of the pigments were NYX but, found five to be from J cats. I not mad or disappointed the colors are still very pretty overall and there were two pigments of the same color as well. Just wish that they didn&#x27;t do that.</li>
    <li> Highly pigmented and a little will last a long time</li>
    <li> they looked gorgeous already just when taking them out of the package&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they are so colourful, pearl-shinny i dont even know how to describe them correctly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the tones are so vivid and stunning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they did seem a little small at first glance , but when you actually realize how much product you get inside of each little flask, then its really worth the money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;they will probably last until the day i get married :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;absolutely gorgeous&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;d buy them again anytime&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;totally recommended</li>
    <li> From looking at the picture of the eye shadow set it appears that the bottles are somehow stacked on/in something.  But when they arrived, they were loose and I had to purchase something to put them in so that they were not all jumbled together.  The products themselves, however, are nice colors and my daughter loves them.  Basically I was just put off by their packaging, I guess.</li>
    <li> it is loose powder eye shadow.  thought it was going to be creams.  however the colors are great.  every color you can imagine.  they are very pretty and they last  love the sparkly ones</li>
    <li> This is worth the $$. i love every color and they are so shimmery. the colors are bright and last all day</li>
    <li> the colors are super pigmented and so pretty!!! It was totally worth the price! I would definitely recommend this to all makeup lovers!!</li>
    <li> I love the loose powder eyeshadows the colors r amaziing n pop easily I would totally buy them all over agaiin!</li>
    <li> OK for those of you who are seeing people post about how small these jars are... get over it. There is WAY more pigment than one person could feasibly use in a very, very long time. The colors I can differentiate from without a problem. Even the brush is useful.  Great product, very professional looking and really good pigment.</li>
    <li> The eyeshadows came a day early and in nice packaging. The eyeshadow brush is very soft and held up under the first cleaning. The only problem I have is that the opening of the bottle is too small. So I just put the eyeshadows in different containers. For the price the pigment is good quality.</li>
    <li> These pigments and crystal eyeshafows are divine.. I loved the collection sooooo much and would recommend them for every makeup addict</li>
    <li> I love mixing these together to make customized colors. I always use a stick type under eye concealer on my lids when I wear these to make it last longer and be more vibrant.I used the glittery shades to add to clear polish and make my own fun top coats.</li>
    <li> These are great! the containers are a bit small and i will be transferring them to new ones but I just love the colors and cant wait to use them for my next photo shoot!</li>
    <li> I love the selection of colors, some of which I have used a lot, some others not so much, but they are fun and I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments when I match the clothes I am wearing with the same color glitter.</li>
    <li> great buy don&#x27;t like the glitter ones but they have came in handy for holiday and prom great when applied wet too</li>
    <li> I got this today love it very nice like all the color&#x27;s very nice good price. Love it recomand this.thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these pigments. Got this as a Christmas gift and I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments whenever I do my makeup with these. As others have said, the brush that they give you does not fit into the bottles, so you might want to get a pack of makeup brushes to go with it. The colors are vibrant, it comes with 3 primers so that the shadow stays on your eyes, and you can do really creative things with them. I feel like I have enough eye makeup to last me the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> I purchased this set because I love to experiment with colors. The colors are very vibrant and easy to apply with a primer. The only thing I would complain about is how small the bottles are. The brush that came with it doesn&#x27;t fit in the bottle opening so I have to poor a little out everytime. Needless to say, I get eye shadow all over but I learned to use an empty eye shadow to make this process a little less messy.  Definitely worth the $ for such variety. I don&#x27;t use the glitter ones but they are nice to have around for halloween.</li>
    <li> If you want true pigment colors that will actually show up on your eyes like they do in the bottle, these are the shadows for YOU. For best results use some sort of eye primer ( I recommend NYX eye primer in the little jars~ last foreva and keeps eye shadow on for good). The shipping was handled perfectly and all the colors came as expected. I get complements on my makeup on a daily basis, I look forward every morning to do my makeup, but its SOOO hard to choose what colors to wear that day, there are just so many. These colors will last you a very long time and the combinations are endless.  I recommend also buying the NYX eyeliner pencil set. It also comes in 40 radiant colors. You will never need to buy another eyeliner or shadow after you try these.</li>
    <li> All colors are great. You can combine the diferent colors according your clothes. The brush allow a profesional look. I love it.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto, llego en excelentes condiciones, lo recomiendo al 100%. Vendedor Excelente y serio. Saludos y que dios los bendiga</li>
    <li> YESSSSS GOD, I LOVE THEM</li>
    <li> Great shadow, but extremely irritating packaging. Powder falls out everywhere and wastes. It&#x27;s just an extremely small bottle with no type of sifting lid. If you buy them, plan to depot them.</li>
    <li> I have not got it yet and looks like to much fun and so look forward to useing it in my new makeup trunk.</li>
    <li> I was looking for eyeshadows that were different. I wanted to get alot for a small price and I sure did that. They were really small but their worth it. Love them all. The only problem is that the bottles are so small that you cant put a normal size eyeshadow brush in it. The eyeshadow last really long as long as you put pimer on before it will last all day.</li>
</ol>
