      <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
      <li>This stuff is great for reducing pore size and calming down acne.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is great for acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> LOVE anything pumpkin, and this pumpkin skin mask is the best! The&lt;br /&gt;pumpkin in the mask will give you a light peel, leaving your skin&lt;br /&gt;soft and smooth.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff. Originally bought it in a boutique in Canada and when I tried it at home I couldnt believe the burn! It says it de-gunks your face and pores and IT FEELS like it really does! I always feel like I&#x27;ve done my skin a service after I use this. But usually I get pores open before using it with gentle exfoliate and hot water.  The smell is divine and its just feels so good when its on. I bought the Sundae Best flavor thinking it served the same purpose but that one is a skin softener, so now I need to buy this again- but it is a must have, so ! :)</li>
    <li> my skin become soft and moisture</li>
    <li> had this put on at a spa then found it on amazon for half the price. once a week application. works great.</li>
    <li> thank U, Initially appeared to be an excellent product; and I am now under experimentation</li>
    <li> The smell is yummy. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I  use a lot of masques and this one feels great and my skin looks great after using it. My skin is really sensitive in the winter, but summer it toughens up. The products states not to use it on sensitive skin so I pretty much avoid the areas outside the T-Zone with masques like this. It temporarily reduces your pores which I like as when you get older your pores enlarge. I&#x27;ve used this masque, moisturized, put on a primer and then a foundation and my pores look &amp;#34;like new&amp;#34; for an evening or day.</li>
    <li> The previous reviewer is absolutely right - this mask smells SOOOOO good. It smells like you just coated your face in pumpkin pie so, fair warning, using it might make you hungry.  I love this mask! It tingles/stings a little but leaves your with soft, glowing skin. I think the difference is noticeable, particularly on pore size. I highly recommend this mask.  They say it lasts 14-16 applications, but I think it may last longer. I&#x27;ve already done three masks with it and have barely made a dent in the jar.</li>
    <li> This is a great face mask! The smell is amazing and my face looks and feels radiant after each use!</li>
    <li> OH MEE OH MY! i received my order today . I just couldn&#x27;t wait to try it! wow! what is this divine stuff they put in this wonderful beauty product that just makes you wanna eat it like a delicious decadent dessert! simply divine! i love it! i love the way it makes my skin so soft and so smooth! wow! SPLENDID  indeed!!! Thank you Farmhouse. :)</li>
    <li> This mask really does what says it should do - minimizing pores, clearing the skin. I definitely like this product.</li>
    <li> Shipping for this Item was great I got it way before the product should have gotten to me.&lt;br /&gt;As for use it worked great. Smells wonderful and is a beautiful color.&lt;br /&gt;I think with the perfume or whatever was a bit too strong for my skin which tends to be on the sensitive side. so when I washed it off my face was super red. I took an hour nap and when I woke up The red was gone and my face looked great.</li>
    <li> They look and sound amazing, until i used them.This is the second FHF product i have purchased and was disappointed with. The smell is so overpowering and the color is very rich, making me think that there are alot of dyes and perfumes in this mask. The tingling feeling is that of an allergic reaction. I have spent $75 on these products and they sit on my shelf. Not pleased at all.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift, and upon opening it was incredibly pleased by the scent! It&#x27;s a truly lovely pumpkin spice smell that quickly puts you in a fall mood. I was surprised by the tingle until I read on the tub that it&#x27;s supposed to happen, and after that it wasn&#x27;t worrying but rather enjoyable. My skin feels fresh and clean. So far this is a great mask!</li>
    <li> I have used this several times. The smell is great, it can be put on evenly, and doesn&#x27;t flake off my face as it drys. It does the normal slight sting as an enzyme product. My face can be a little pink after using it, but it is smooth and fresh. But, I have noticed no change in size of pores, or breakouts whatsoever. I just use it to relax.</li>
    <li> This mask is amazing, the best I&#x27;ve used.  I had a pumpkin enzyme treatment at a pricey spa, but this mask actually works better for my skin.  I use this mask about once or twice a week and my skin is smooth and glowing after. I also have Sundae Best and Pajama Party (both of which also work quite well), but I think Splendid Dirt is the best of the three.</li>
    <li> My skin definitely feels soft and very clean afterwards. I even enjoy the &amp;#34;oxygenation&amp;#34; that occurs... your face kind of tingles and is a little flushed but it&#x27;s refreshing (and the flush doesn&#x27;t last long).</li>
    <li> LOVE! I have this mask and the yogurt and they are equally wonderful!!</li>
    <li> Nice pumpkin mask. I wanted something with pumpkin for the scent. It does have a good smell but notice I get a slight burn when I first put it on but its not a problem for me. This mask cleans out pores and enhance the appearance of my skin. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This mask is by far my favorite mask ever! It smells like a pumpkin pie and has a slight tingling sensation when you&#x27;re wearing the mask. I also love what it does for my skin leaving it bright and soft! Love Fhf masks!</li>
    <li> There is almost an instant tingle when you put it on. I like that you only need a thin layer. I even put it on zits over night. I will purchase other masks from Farm House.</li>
    <li> This review will compare 2 different pumpkin enzyme masks I purchased on amazon. I have used both masks for several weeks and am sharing my own personal experience. The two masks I used were FHF splendid dirt and IQ Natural glycolic acid pumpkin mask in 5%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FHF Splendid dirt-&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Spreads easily and evenly&lt;br /&gt;Smells lovely&lt;br /&gt;Nice quality glass container&lt;br /&gt;Generous amount in the jar&lt;br /&gt;Tingly burning sensation feels like it&#x27;s really working!&lt;br /&gt;Dries quickly but doesn&#x27;t dry hard and can be rinsed off with just water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;It does smell lovely, but it doesn&#x27;t really smell like natural pumpkin. More like a pumpkin candle.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not super obvious how much of the mask to use or how long to leave it on. I found that applying a thick layer caused more of a burning sensation than a thin layer.&lt;br /&gt;Though it feels like it&#x27;s working to remove a dead layer of skin, my skin didn&#x27;t look any brighter, cleaner or clearer after using the mask consistently. I&#x27;m questioning the quality/ true strength of the glycolic acid in this mask.&lt;br /&gt;Though it does rinse off with just water, I always felt that it left an oily film on my skin and didn&#x27;t rinse clean. Even after washing with my facial cleanser there was still an odd &#x27;moisture&#x27; texture left on my skin. In turn, my skin began producing more oil than usual and I noticed a few extra breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IQ-&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Looks and smells like real canned pumpkin&lt;br /&gt;IQ makes several glycolic strengths of this mask (5%, 12%, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;IQ has a clear detailed description and instructions on the packaging and on their website&lt;br /&gt;I noticed very litter/ almost not burning sensation&lt;br /&gt;After 1 use my skin was softer, brighter, and my pores were clean&lt;br /&gt;Rinses easily and leaves no film after washing with a cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Breakouts are calmer and heal very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to spread evenly. FHF mask spreads beautifully compared to IQ. You will not get even coverage with the IQ mask.&lt;br /&gt;Plastic packing. FHF has glass.&lt;br /&gt;Small quantity. The 1 oz. size is tiny! You will get maybe 3-5 masks out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall opinion is that the IQ mask works much better than the FHF. I think the FHF mask is &#x27;fun&#x27; to use due to the tingly sensation and the pumpkin candle smell, but the results just aren&#x27;t nearly as good as the IQ. IQ wins for me.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping! Love this mask</li>
    <li> So far has worked well for acne. I have been to a dermatologist and tried many other products in the past.</li>
    <li> This burned my face when I applied it.</li>
    <li> I used this a few times a week and it stings a little bit when you first put it on (it is a peel after all) and I&#x27;m a teeny bit red in certain places after rinsing it off. It&#x27;s a bit of a pain to rinse off because you have to rub hard with your hands and use alot of water; sometimes I just use a washcloth (which isn&#x27;t as gentle) and boom, its all off. My face did get more radiant, clear and my acne scars were reduced after one use; they get better after each. It&#x27;s not a huge difference, this mask lightened them about 5% after each use. So it was noticeable but not like a 40% glycolic peel or other chemical peel. I use a 40% glycolic peel by Skin Obsession and then this peel 1 week later; every month; because you are only supposed to use chemical peels monthly. I do sometimes leave it on for a few hours(2-4) and if I have any acne on my face, its completely gone or way shrunken down after I wash this mask off. I like this product as a part of my skin care routine and use it once a week. I will probably continue to use a FHF mask/peel about twice a week every week from now on. I love that it comes in a jar because I can get out all of the product and not waste product or money when its near empty. Also I can recycle the jar by putting Q-tops, cotton balls, bobby pins or whatever inside after all the scrub is gone.</li>
    <li> Once a week I will have a &amp;#34;mini spa day&amp;#34; I will wash my fash using my clarion sonic (which I only use once a week) with an exfoliating cleaner. Once that is rinsed off and my face is dry I will use this mask for roughly ten mins then apply my Josie maran argan oil. And it makes all the difference. My skin has been awesome. It was good without the mask but now it&#x27;s AMAZING. Recommend this to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also says there is 14-16 applications but it seems to far more than that.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of pumpkin. This mask delivers on not only the scent but also the exfoliation benefits. Beware, this stuff makes your skin sting and tingle, but that&#x27;s the active part of the mask. Afterwards, the skin is soft, refreshed and squeaky clean. LOVE!</li>
    <li> Very effective yummy smelling product! My skin is brighter</li>
    <li> Quick deliver with prime at a reasonable price.  I was first introduced to this product when the spa I work at brought it in as a promotional item to sell.  I&#x27;m an Esthetician and we even used it as an add on item in our facials.  It&#x27;s a great mask!  Exfoliates, tightens pores and leaves your skin feeling fresh and radiant.  It does have a tingly factor and may be a little too intense if you have extremely sensitive skin. Smells fantastic! Great at home pumpkin enzyme mask!</li>
    <li> This product is as described. I love the fact that it is made out of Texas and that it is a quality product. I use it regularly as both a face mask and a spot treatment for pimples.</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE mask. I am on my second jar and also sent one to my sister. I love how I can really feel it working! My boyfriend and I both use it weekly. Our concerns are acne, hyperpigmentation, wrinkles, oiliness, and flakiness. I always use this mask before I extract the blackheads. It makes it so much easier by getting rid of the dead skin cells and softening the debris. My skin looks clear and bright.</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT! I&#x27;m an obsessive user of face masks, and I have a collection that borders on embarrassing. Okay, it IS embarrassing. While nearly every mask has visible benefits after use, some are better than others ... this being one of the best I&#x27;ve tried. The only drawback is that it smells so scrumptious you will have a hard time not licking it off while you&#x27;re wearing it. Stings a little bit on application, but in that strangely pleasant way devoted maskers will be familiar with. My face was slightly flushed after washing it off, but it quickly subsided into a pore-less glow that transcends comparison to the many other masks I&#x27;ve used. Definitely highly recommended, good stuff here.</li>
    <li> Bought this at the spa the first time and found it on Amazon for way cheaper with free shipping, can&#x27;t go wrong there!!! This stuff is great for reducing pore size and calming down acne. Smells like a pumpkin pie for my face, love it!!!</li>
    <li> great for any skin, leave a nice clean finish, should buy if need to get clear felling , unclogs pore,</li>
    <li> The smell is so good you want to eat it!  It has a nice warming effect and leaves your skin looking bronzed.  I suffer from acne and this does not make me break out.  Great product.  I will buy again and would recommend.</li>
    <li> I am in my 30s and still deal with oily skin and breakouts. Lately I&#x27;ve been using masks twice a week to help keep everything under control. This mask helps shrink pores, reduces oiliness and breakouts, and leaves my face with a nice glow. It does slightly tingle and can be a little difficult to remove but soooo worth it! I like it better than some other brands I&#x27;ve tried that are more than double the price. Definitely worth buying.</li>
    <li> Great mask, does the jog well cleaning pores and skin surface. Smells wonderful .&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for holidays at home  &amp;#34;facials&amp;#34;</li>

    <li> Got this for my wife as one of her Christmas gifts. She LOVES it. She said that its got a slight tingle that turns to hell fire and she says she feels like it&#x27;s working and shrinking her pores. Mission accomplished!</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m using it about a week now and I luv it&lt;br /&gt;The smill is amazing and yummy :)&lt;br /&gt;It cleared my face from some breakouts and it tightened my face .&lt;br /&gt;First when applied it will tingle a bit but It will go away after a couple of seconds, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin .&lt;br /&gt;M going to try the yogurt mask because so far M in love with all of FHF products</li>
    <li> Looove the way my skin looks and feels after using this. The warm tingly burn opens your pores, cleans up your skin and after a few uses I noticed a difference in my complexion</li>
