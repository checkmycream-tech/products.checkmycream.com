      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>This item was waiting for me when I arrived and it is successfully overseas with me now.  </li>
      <li>It is a good substitute.</li>
      <li>With its cool aloe and lanolin and medicated properties, Perfect for the skin.</li>
      <li>When I couldn&#x27;t find at store years ago, I just assumed 1 more product I loved was no longer being made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have yet to find a better product than Nozema&#x27;s medicated shave cream with aloe and Lanolin, for value for money and a good shave.</li>
      <li>Great for a clean, close shave without nicks and cuts.</li>
      <li>Also Noxzema has a pleasant smell and is easy to rinse off.</li>
      <li>but by far, this is the best.  </li>
      <li>and this is fantastic!</li>
      <li>and it didnt cost as much as the store does - great price</li>
      <li>Who knew that something so inexpensive and basic could be the best product out there?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an okay shaving cream, but for the price there are better.</li>
      <li>so i may develop more of a preference for it as time goes on.</li>
      <li>and I am not someone who has to shave as often as most.  </li>
      <li>Sure there are brands of shaving cream with thicker lather</li>
      <li>I will be stocking up on these more often.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this shaving cream to anyone who wants their skin to feel great after a shave.</li>
      <li>i was expecting much more.  </li>
      <li>It has a very light, very clean smell that doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
      <li>Nicely lathers and leaves your face feeling soft and smells pretty good too!</li>
      <li>It is a good shave cream, but Noxzema for Sensitive skin is better.</li>
      <li>Goes well with all skin types, Rich foamy lather for smooth shave and refreshing feel.</li>
      <li>The trick--with any shaving foam--is to exfoliate first (with a washcloth and some good facial soap is perfect) and then to apply far more of the shave cream than you think you&#x27;ll need.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to have shipped right to your door if you can&#x27;t find it at your local drugstore, and it&#x27;s the brand and the formula that has been providing great shaving results for many many years.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t clump up, goes on smooth and is easy to rinse off.</li>
      <li>The ingredients are fantastic for your skin: Dimethicone, Glycerin, Aloe Vera and Lanolin.</li>
      <li>Then when it stopped being available in stores, I just knew Amazon would have it</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
      <li>This shaving cream is very nice for the legs and such.  </li>
      <li>I am not usually picky when selecting shaving creams, in most cases any shaving cream works better than soap and water.  </li>
      <li>In an age where there are so many products to choose from, I choose the one that is simple, trusted and reliably effective.  </li>
      <li>Noxzema works wonderful as an aid for shaving, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Simple is sometimes best, and that&#x27;s what this provides, simple, quality results.</li>
      <li>Over the years I have tried many different shaving creams and foams, including those that cost many times that of this product.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely keep using and recommending Noxzema for many more years to come.</li>
      <li>The thick lather is great and the aloe and lanolin formula provide a smooth, comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>Noxzema Shave Creams lather up much better, but do not have that Old Spice Essence.</li>
      <li>The can is a nice size too, so it should last awhile.</li>
      <li>It works even better than the plain that I&#x27;ve used for many years.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much - I can shave in comfort for another 6 months.</li>
      <li>I had no irritation after using the shave cream and it left my skin very smooth.</li>
      <li>This was my first time using this shaving cream</li>
      <li>I first purchased it on a trip to North Carolina.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always used the plain Noxzema but this was available for Prime shipping and I love it.  </li>
      <li>and I have found that the results are far superior to any other product I have tried.  </li>
      <li>hard to find, glad its available on line, have ordered before, only product that makes shaving easy on the face</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>Specially in the approaching summer season.</li>
      <li>It not only foams up well, but leaves you with a very soft and smooth shave.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Noxzema and will be using these from now on.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The aloe is very soothing and we&#x27;ve had less nicks/cuts/razor burn since using this, I love the way it smells and how soft it makes his face/my legs.</li>
      <li>Leaves his face very moisturized and soft.</li>
      <li>For any man with sensitive skin, this product works !</li>
      <li>The product was received in short time and was exactly as advertised.  </li>
      <li>This actually makes my face feel less smooth and makes it break out more than any other shaving cream i have tried.</li>
      <li>leaves skin soft and moisturized after every use.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and shaving my face and neck has always been a problem.  </li>
      <li>I do have somewhat sensitive skin and the Noxzema shaving cream</li>
      <li>I used the product and found it completely satisfactory.</li>
      <li>Now that I can no longer find Old Spice Shave Cream at the store I have turned to Noxzema for Men Shave Cream.</li>
      <li>My old brand skintimate is now using vegetable oil instead of olive oil</li>
      <li>The smell is more of a personal preference/problem simply because it smells like a bar of soap other than that the problem would be that after I used it, it felt as if I had soap gunk stick on my skin, but that feeling goas away after about 10-20 minutes.</li>
      <li>But, the last few years, I have not been able to find it at local retail stores.  </li>
      <li>really caused little to no irritation or itching and left my face feeling smooth and not too dry.  </li>
      <li>A long time ago in a galaxy far far away, I had a doctor who recommended this shaving cream for my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I have only used it once so far</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend, especially for people with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>They have an essence similar to the old days of your local neighborhood barber shop.</li>
      <li>The foam creates a generous thick lather, and after my shave my skin feels smooth and that it&#x27;s been left hydrated.</li>

    <li> A long time ago in a galaxy far far away, I had a doctor who recommended this shaving cream for my sensitive skin.  Then when it stopped being available in stores, I just knew Amazon would have it and they did.  For any man with sensitive skin, this product works !</li>
    <li> It is a good shave cream, but Noxzema for Sensitive skin is better. I bought this item expecting the same result of the red one.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and shaving my face and neck has always been a problem.  Over the years I have tried many different shaving creams and foams, including those that cost many times that of this product.  I have been using this for several months now (purchased at a local drug store) and I have found that the results are far superior to any other product I have tried.  The trick--with any shaving foam--is to exfoliate first (with a washcloth and some good facial soap is perfect) and then to apply far more of the shave cream than you think you&#x27;ll need.  Shave very slowly in short strokes and rinse your razor between each one.  It also helps to shave in the shower, where your pores are open from the steam, then wash the excess from your face with cold water, thereby closing your pores.  I have done this with lots of expensive \\&quot;designer\\&quot; and department store brand shave products, but by far, this is the best.  No more bumps, red marks not to mention much less irritation.  Who knew that something so inexpensive and basic could be the best product out there? I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this saving cream for 30 years.  But, the last few years, I have not been able to find it at local retail stores.  So, now I buy it online.  Sure there are brands of shaving cream with thicker lather but this one works well for me.</li>
    <li> Well, i wish i would not have gotten this.  i was expecting much more.  This actually makes my face feel less smooth and makes it break out more than any other shaving cream i have tried.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years, it is great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used the plain Noxzema but this was available for Prime shipping and I love it.  It works even better than the plain that I&#x27;ve used for many years.</li>

    <li> Great product. Specially in the approaching summer season. With its cool aloe and lanolin and medicated properties, Perfect for the skin. Goes well with all skin types, Rich foamy lather for smooth shave and refreshing feel. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> The best that I have had.9</li>
    <li> This product works wonders! Great for a clean, close shave without nicks and cuts.Nicely lathers and leaves your face feeling soft and smells pretty good too!</li>
    <li> Now that I can no longer find Old Spice Shave Cream at the store I have turned to Noxzema for Men Shave Cream. It is a good substitute. Noxzema Shave Creams lather up much better, but do not have that Old Spice Essence. They have an essence similar to the old days of your local neighborhood barber shop. I have tried Noxema&#x27;s Medicated Shave Cream with Aloe And Lanolin and I really like it. It not only foams up well, but leaves you with a very soft and smooth shave. I highly recommend Noxzema and will be using these from now on.</li>
    <li> The thick lather is great and the aloe and lanolin formula provide a smooth, comfortable shave. I had no irritation after using the shave cream and it left my skin very smooth. The can is a nice size too, so it should last awhile. I would definitely recommend, especially for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> bought this product for hubby he loves it and it didnt cost as much as the store does - great price</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. leaves skin soft and moisturized after every use. doesn&#x27;t clump up, goes on smooth and is easy to rinse off. leaves no residue after you&#x27;re done. I would recommend this shaving cream to anyone who wants their skin to feel great after a shave.</li>
    <li> In an age where there are so many products to choose from, I choose the one that is simple, trusted and reliably effective.  I have yet to find a better product than Nozema&#x27;s medicated shave cream with aloe and Lanolin, for value for money and a good shave.

It&#x27;s easy to have shipped right to your door if you can&#x27;t find it at your local drugstore, and it&#x27;s the brand and the formula that has been providing great shaving results for many many years.</li>
    <li> This shaving cream is very nice for the legs and such.  I have used it for a long time, but the local grocery and drug stores do not reliably sell it.</li>
    <li> This is my shaving cream of choice. I first purchased it on a trip to North Carolina. Upon returning to San Antonio I discovered that no drugstores/pharmacies carried this Noxema product. So, I ordered through Amazon. This is my second order of this product from Amazon, and I will continue to order as long as you carry. This is the best shaving cream I have ever used! in 65 years of shaving.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay shaving cream, but for the price there are better. The 2 problems I had were the feeling after as well as how it smells. The smell is more of a personal preference/problem simply because it smells like a bar of soap other than that the problem would be that after I used it, it felt as if I had soap gunk stick on my skin, but that feeling goas away after about 10-20 minutes.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item prior to a visit to the US so that I could avoid spending valuable time shopping for shaving cream.  This item was waiting for me when I arrived and it is successfully overseas with me now.  Great service!  Thank you very much - I can shave in comfort for another 6 months.</li>
    <li> hard to find, glad its available on line, have ordered before, only product that makes shaving easy on the face</li>
    <li> This was my first time using this shaving cream and I am not someone who has to shave as often as most.  A canister like this is bound to last me for the next 6 months.  I am not usually picky when selecting shaving creams, in most cases any shaving cream works better than soap and water.  This brand was not much different than other brands i have used in the past like Gilette Edge, Barbasol, basically whatever the local gas station or drugstore carries.  I do have somewhat sensitive skin and the Noxzema shaving cream really caused little to no irritation or itching and left my face feeling smooth and not too dry.  I never see this brand at the store otherwise i would probably buy it occasionally.  I have only used it once so far so i may develop more of a preference for it as time goes on.</li>
    <li> It leaves RUST STAINS…I specifically asked the seller if this product leaves rust marks and he said no.</li>
    <li> Noxzema works wonderful as an aid for shaving, especially if you have sensitive skin. It&#x27;s components of Aloe and Lanolin assist in moisturizing your skin after you shave. Also Noxzema has a pleasant smell and is easy to rinse off. I will definitely keep using and recommending Noxzema for many more years to come.</li>
    <li> I know this is marketed for men and I always bought this for my hubby (he loves it but it&#x27;s very hard to find in local stores although I&#x27;ve had luck at rite aid) and when my shaving cream ran out I used this to shave my legs. My old brand skintimate is now using vegetable oil instead of olive oil so I needed to switch shaving creams ASAP and this is fantastic! It&#x27;s my new go-to shaving cream to shave my legs EVERYDAY. It has a very light, very clean smell that doesn&#x27;t linger. The ingredients are fantastic for your skin: Dimethicone, Glycerin, Aloe Vera and Lanolin. The aloe is very soothing and we&#x27;ve had less nicks/cuts/razor burn since using this, I love the way it smells and how soft it makes his face/my legs. GREAT product here! FYI its VERY hard to find in local stores but I sometimes find that rite aid has it for $2.99 a can.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Hard to find, but my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaving cream. Leaves his face very moisturized and soft. The shaving process is way smoother now, no more cuts on his face. I will be stocking up on these more often.</li>
    <li> When I couldn&#x27;t find at store years ago, I just assumed 1 more product I loved was no longer being made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason (aloe?) this has always been the only shave cream that has protected my legs from feeling dry and tight and slightly irritated after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this again and it hasn&#x27;t changed in how great it works for me.</li>
