### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>So awesome.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy to find it online.</li>
      <li>A great tasting toothpaste which agrees with my wife&#x27;s gum problems.</li>
      <li>so I did not pay attention.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product.</li>
      <li>The grapefruit mint flavor is refreshing and pleasant.</li>
      <li>I like the package design, the smell is nice.</li>
      <li>Nice taste, but</li>
      <li>Also, best flavor toothpaste I&#x27;ve found--I loathe most mints, but this had a crisp citrusy flavor.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m glad to have found it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite toothpaste ever.</li>
      <li>Got this on sale at CVS for my toddler because he mostly eats his toothpaste</li>
      <li>Even my picky kids love it:)</li>
      <li>The flavor turned out be interesting, for sure.  </li>
      <li>Not terrible, but could be better.</li>
      <li>Purchased this because I thought that 99% natural sounded great.</li>
      <li>One would think that the design would lend itself to easy application of the product onto the toothbrush, but that is not the case.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>just wish there was a fluoride free version</li>
      <li>they enjoy brushing with it.</li>
      <li>My kids enjoy using this toothpaste each day...</li>
      <li>I like the flavor, but my teeth never feel clean after using this.</li>
      <li>I like it because it is more natural and chemical free for my children!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too sticky to slide down on its own, and the best way to get more down to the bottom is to hit it against something.</li>
      <li>You will like it if you are not crazy about super strong mint flavored toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Fun stuff.</li>
      <li>What really makes this toothpaste stand out for me is how clean my teeth and mouth feel afterwards.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other flavors by this brand, and this is pretty good.</li>
      <li>Not much like real grapefruit but refreshing, plus not too strong that feel like brushing with fragrance paste.  </li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste, our local pharmacy stopped selling it</li>
      <li>First of all I will not suggest buying this online.</li>
      <li>they change their packaging to a more traditional/usable toothpaste tube, they&#x27;ll get me back as a customer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m allergic to something that is in pretty much all toothpastes.</li>
      <li>The mint is there but subtle, the citrus is more prominent.</li>
      <li>I actually rather enjoy the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Better than expected.  </li>
      <li>I originally found it at a drugstore, but I moved and can&#x27;t find it anywhere locally.</li>
      <li>The grapefruit mint has a strange taste to it, not one that I particularly enjoy waking up to each morning.</li>
      <li>love the toothpaste, but the bottle just makes it not worth it in the end.</li>
      <li>Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a fresh change.</li>
      <li>Normally I don&#x27;t buy any toothpaste with mint in it</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;There is not much too special.</li>
      <li>This is the first one I have found that I can actually use.</li>
      <li>so I wanted something all natural and companies charge you an arm and a leg for kid&#x27;s toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Pleasantly surprised by minty fruit flavor.</li>
      <li>It needs the soft sides so you can squeeze the remainder out, and unless that happens, I&#x27;m going to have to try something else.</li>
      <li>my 10 year old daughter doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I love that the product is natural and doesn&#x27;t have unnecessary dyes.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pleasant but not so strong as to make my coffee taste nasty afterwards.</li>
      <li>The case is stiff and doesn&#x27;t bend, so you can&#x27;t force toothpaste from the top down towards the bottom.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care one way or the other about the packaging.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve broken the caps multiple times trying to get more toothpaste out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> I was sold on the Pink Grapefruit flavor just from seeing an ad in a magazine.  </li>

<li> There are quite a few comments here about both the packaging and the taste.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this product.</li>
<li> As an added plus, the small squeeze bottle stands on it&#x27;s cap neatly in your drawer or medicine cabinet.</li>
<li> Not sure about the whitening effect since I didn&#x27;t bought it for that purpose</li>
<li> It&#x27;s minty, just not overwhelming.</li>
<li> Yes the after taste can be weird, but I&#x27;ll take the few minor cons over gum swelling and pain I get from others!</li>
<li> I do not like mint, and that leaves me with very few options for toothpaste.</li>
<li> My three-year-old hasn&#x27;t complained, and doesn&#x27;t have any cavities or dental problems.</li>
<li> The price and shipping is ridiculous.</li>
<li> I would say we wasted about 30% - which makes it just as expensive as &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>
<li> /&gt;However, I will second everyone on this website, the packaging design is awful.</li>

    <li> I do not like mint, and that leaves me with very few options for toothpaste. I&#x27;ve tried other flavors by this brand, and this is pretty good. The mint is there but subtle, the citrus is more prominent. I actually rather enjoy the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I will second everyone on this website, the packaging design is awful. You simply cannot get all of the toothpaste out. The case is stiff and doesn&#x27;t bend, so you can&#x27;t force toothpaste from the top down towards the bottom. It&#x27;s too sticky to slide down on its own, and the best way to get more down to the bottom is to hit it against something. I&#x27;ve broken the caps multiple times trying to get more toothpaste out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the toothpaste, but the bottle just makes it not worth it in the end. It needs the soft sides so you can squeeze the remainder out, and unless that happens, I&#x27;m going to have to try something else. Maybe there&#x27;s a mint flavor out there that I can tolerate...</li>
    <li> Nice taste, but I don&#x27;t know if this can whiten my teeth. Overall. it is an above average toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t like the design of the cap, very hard to open.</li>
    <li> My kids enjoy using this toothpaste each day...they enjoy brushing with it.</li>
    <li> There are quite a few comments here about both the packaging and the taste. I like the taste. It&#x27;s pleasant but not so strong as to make my coffee taste nasty afterwards. I don&#x27;t really care one way or the other about the packaging. What really makes this toothpaste stand out for me is how clean my teeth and mouth feel afterwards. And I mean CLEAN, not like a mint bomb has gone off and left nothing but mint behind. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a fresh change.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to something that is in pretty much all toothpastes. This is the first one I have found that I can actually use. It&#x27;s fantastic. Yes the after taste can be weird, but I&#x27;ll take the few minor cons over gum swelling and pain I get from others! I do prefer targets packaging over this though</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toothpaste ever. I originally found it at a drugstore, but I moved and can&#x27;t find it anywhere locally. I&#x27;m so happy to find it online. The grapefruit mint flavor is refreshing and pleasant. You will like it if you are not crazy about super strong mint flavored toothpaste. It&#x27;s minty, just not overwhelming. As an added plus, the small squeeze bottle stands on it&#x27;s cap neatly in your drawer or medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> Purchased this because I thought that 99% natural sounded great. The grapefruit mint has a strange taste to it, not one that I particularly enjoy waking up to each morning. One would think that the design would lend itself to easy application of the product onto the toothbrush, but that is not the case. Gravity does not pull the toothpaste to the bottom where it is to be dispensed. For some reason it is stuck up inside. If you bang it on the counter to attempt to bring it down all you&#x27;ll do is break the lid. Yeah. Fun stuff. Don&#x27;t waste your time with this product. Try Tom&#x27;s of Maine or Kiss My Face.</li>
    <li> Even my picky kids love it:)</li>
    <li> So awesome.  I only use this and avoid all the brand names</li>
    <li> Got this on sale at CVS for my toddler because he mostly eats his toothpaste so I wanted something all natural and companies charge you an arm and a leg for kid&#x27;s toothpaste. My three-year-old hasn&#x27;t complained, and doesn&#x27;t have any cavities or dental problems. But they have GOT to change the packaging. It dispenses messily, requiring you to clean off wasted toothpaste with every squirt and once you near the end of your tube, it is impossible to get the last fifth or so out of the tube. I would say we wasted about 30% - which makes it just as expensive as &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I like that it has low sodium lauryl sulfate but does have fluoride. Also, best flavor toothpaste I&#x27;ve found--I loathe most mints, but this had a crisp citrusy flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that the packaging is pretty inconvenient: it&#x27;s pretty hard to get the toothpaste out once you get down to under half of the bottle or so, and it seems wasteful. I&#x27;m not going to spend $6 on toothpaste again until I can actually USE all of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they change their packaging to a more traditional/usable toothpaste tube, they&#x27;ll get me back as a customer.</li>
    <li> First of all I will not suggest buying this online. The price and shipping is ridiculous. I bought at my local CVS at $5.99&lt;br /&gt;There is not much too special. I like the package design, the smell is nice. Not much like real grapefruit but refreshing, plus not too strong that feel like brushing with fragrance paste.  Not sure about the whitening effect since I didn&#x27;t bought it for that purpose so I did not pay attention.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product. Will continue using it and considering try the Mouthwash product.</li>
    <li> Better than expected.  Normally I don&#x27;t buy any toothpaste with mint in it but the grapefruit flavor intrigued me.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste, our local pharmacy stopped selling it so I&#x27;m glad to have found it on Amazon.  I guess the taste isn&#x27;t for everyone though, my husband doesn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> tastes terrible and my teeth never feel clean no matter how much i brush my teeth.</li>
    <li> I like the flavor but my 10 year old daughter doesn&#x27;t. She does like this brands monitor mint mouthwash. I like it because it is more natural and chemical free for my children!</li>
    <li> I love that the product is natural and doesn&#x27;t have unnecessary dyes.  I was sold on the Pink Grapefruit flavor just from seeing an ad in a magazine.  The flavor turned out be interesting, for sure.  It&#x27;s just on the threshold of being like drinking OJ after brushing your teeth.  Not terrible, but could be better.</li>
    <li> A great tasting toothpaste which agrees with my wife&#x27;s gum problems.</li>
    <li> I like the flavor, but my teeth never feel clean after using this. 2 months in and my teeth are starting to feel grimy, ditching this product.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised by minty fruit flavor. .. just wish there was a fluoride free version</li>
