<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ahhh....the smell of the old barbershop. Manly and subtle. An essential powder for those of us who wear powder. Great price on Amazon as well. Will always keep this in stock</li>
    <li> It arrived on time. Packaged well. I love the smell of this powder. As a kid the barber would use this when he finished up a haircut so the smell brings back memories but really smells clean.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product for years at Walgreens, but they stopped carrying it several years ago. Superior after bath and after shave powder.  Extremely fine talc with a light, clean scent.  Reminds me of the barbershop I went to as a kid.</li>
    <li> Good powder! It&#x27;s the same as the one my barber uses. Love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> It smells good and is easy to use.  It functions well as talc powder.  My only complaint and this is a show stopper for me is for some reason they put a red coloring in it.  This means if it gets on the floor it leaves red residue.  If it gets in your clothes it will turn anything white to pink and it doesn&#x27;t wash out.  Take out the color and I may consider buying again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clubman Talc for several years and I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product anywhere near where I live.  Amazon came through again!  The product is excellent.  I highly recomment it for those looking for a good body talc that does not have an offensive flowery fragerance.</li>
    <li> Love the scent! No talc smells like it, or smells as nice. That&#x27;s why I bought a three pack, so I won&#x27;t be without it. Also, Amazon&#x27;s price was a bargain compared to the rip off drug store price I used to pay. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
    <li> This is easily the best solution to almost all of the problems you may encounter in your life. Living in the absurd humidity of Okinawa, this product made life bearable against the relentless moisture. I suppose you could always substitute it with simple baby powder, but this has a most profound scent that makes me wish to dress more as a gentleman and less of a hobo.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Best talc ever. Old fashioned manly scent. If you use this on your baby, it&#x27;ll grow chest hair!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I want to by more for my father and my friends.</li>
    <li> Keeps you dry wherever you use it. Excellent product with nice scent. Will definitely be keeping this on hand at all times</li>
    <li> My Husband loves it and it is a very nice scent compared to other Men&#x27;s powder on the market, but one of the bottle was open and spilled all over the other two! Not having any luck with my recent Amazon order!!</li>
    <li> Remember that barber shop smell?  This light powder is the perfect product to keep you fresh all day long.  Does not turn into a paste when you start sweating.</li>
    <li> Pinaud is the best Men&#x27;s talc on the market! Just like in the Barber Shop. I highly recommend this to any man!</li>
    <li> Guys if you sweat more than usual this is for you! Especially if you&#x27;re a big boy like me. I put this on my neck, chest, and other censored areas. It smells great, keeps me dry, and LADIES WILL LOVE THE SCENT.</li>
    <li> top doesn&#x27;t seal perfectly so powder ends up everywhere</li>
    <li> Smells like the barber shop. Great talc, beats baby powder by a lot.</li>
    <li> Love this talc. I love any product that gives me ol&#x27; timey barber days shop flashbacks. The scent is wonderful but not too strong and it&#x27;s a real good quality talc.</li>
    <li> My balls have grown accustomed to the nice, crisp scent and clean feel of this powder.  I will be a customer for life.</li>
    <li> This talc is wonderful! We use it after new haircuts, to keep the hairs from irritating us, and regularly to keep us cool in the Texas heat. Smells great, and feels great on our skin. It does not get all gunky when wet either. We like this brand of products and were not disappointed in this item. It does have a pink tint to it, instead of being white like most powders. We have had a great experience with it, and would encourage others in the market to try it for themselves.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I use it every day.  It reminds me of a trip to the barbershop of my youth.</li>
    <li> Classic. This stuff is so much better than any other talc powder. It has that classic barber shop scent. Amazon is almost the only place to find it these days, and at a great price!</li>
    <li> I began DE shaving recently and looking into products that, frankly, just work. Tired of the fancy garbage at the stores. Not only is this a great deal but it works and smells better than the store bought brands. Do yourself a favor and give it a try.</li>
    <li> Classic barbershop Pinaud.  It&#x27;s the same powder that your dad and or grandfather used or got used on them when they went to the old barber shops.  Works great, smells great.</li>
    <li> Ummmm....smells really great.  Real \\&quot;manly\\&quot; type smell without knocking over everyone in the room.  Helps absorb sweat, too.  If you&#x27;re looking for something different that doesn&#x27;t have a disgusting strong smell...this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this talc for over 45 years. I use nothing else.</li>
    <li> Has a nice fragrance, similar to Canoe cologne.  It&#x27;s reasonably priced.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Perfect as always.  I&#x27;ve been using this talc with its classic scent for years after showering to help me stay dry all day long.  With a hot summer finally here, it&#x27;s time to use it liberally!</li>
    <li> I dont know why it took me so long to get this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many a great memories due to the quality</li>
    <li> I am completely sold and will probably never go without Clubman Powder for the rest of my life; It&#x27;s that good. BTW, I hate the smell of baby powder, and yet I like the smell of this stuff. Lasts hours, to be frank my \\&quot;junk\\&quot; is never stuck to my leg or crammed together, and also I swear that I feel twice as clean after I use it.   So it&#x27;s like this... shower... feel clean for 20 mins while I completely dry off, then apply talc and POW... everything feels fresh and practically sterile. Plus, hours later, I&#x27;m not concerned if a woman puts her head near my crotch -which bizarrely happens to me more times that one would think. Before, I always worried how \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; I was and now I welcome it with no concern, lol.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It smells awesome!  I will never be without it.  Does not feel like icy hot the way gold bond does.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice powder and smells good, without being over powering, it&#x27;s not anything special. I&#x27;ll buy it again, because the price is very good, and it&#x27;s a masculine product. (I mean it doesn&#x27;t smell like Aunt Susie).</li>
    <li> Another product no longer on the local drugstore shelf.  Our fav.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clubman for years. I like the manly scent. It reminds me of the barber shop of my youth!</li>
    <li> Excellent value on a hard to find product. Can&#x27;t find this at Walgreens. This talc powder has been around for decades and has a uniquely male fragrance. Priced right and a pack of three will last a reasonable time.</li>
    <li> Back in the 80s, I used to buy this at the finer clothing stores, but as fashion got less and less stylish for the general public, I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore.  The internet as we know it was still years away, so I completely lost track of this product.  By chance, I searched the name to see if there was any mention of it on the net and I found it available and on Amazon.  I was wary at first because I didn&#x27;t know if it would be the same as it was and the $13 price tag for three containers seemed a little unrealistic.  The tin I used to buy was pretty big and it was over $20.  I assumed that this price for three would be for very small amounts.  To my pleasant surprise, The containers were pretty big and it is still the same elegant quality it always was.  Because it was pricey before, I didn&#x27;t wear it every day, but now I can.  It&#x27;s nice to know that something of great quality CAN actually be of great value as well.</li>
    <li> These three bottles will last me for a bit/</li>
    <li> This is very nice talcum powder to use!  It has A nice clean scent to it and is A barbrer shop classic!</li>
    <li> I ordered the three pinaud Clubman powders and I recieved them very quickly.  I was happy with it and would order again from this merchant.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I consider Pinaud talc the best.  In my area it is almost impossible to buy it unless you go to a barber supply store.  When I discovered I could get it on line from Amazon I jumped on it.  Package arrived on time and I am a happy fellow.  Smell good too.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Larry</li>
    <li> Clubman products are always great but this is one of our favorites. This smells like a barber shop and is a great price!</li>
    <li> Makes you smell like a barbershop every day. I got this a couple months ago and am still on the first bottle. This stuff goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This powder smells great, barber shop scent. The price is much better than buying in a drug store or specialty store. I will definately order again when I run out.</li>
    <li> nice fresh smelling talc. , not overpowering . The price was great and the delivery was fast.  The three containers will keep me smelling fresh for quite a while</li>
    <li> Great powder; looked for this for a long time. My boys&#x27; hairstylist used this on them when they were little, and I always loved the smell-a little nostalgia, maybe?  Now they are teens, and they are using this-still smells great!!  Clean, slightly masculine, without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> This stuff gets and goes everywhere because it&#x27;s so finely ground (yes it&#x27;s &#x27;talc&#x27; so not good for you to breathe), smells like baby powder, and is overly expensive... The much thicker cheap riteaid powder that has no smell is far better in my opinion. If you&#x27;re looking for a good scent look elsewhere for a nice cologne or old spice body spray.</li>
    <li> if you want:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the finest most absorbent, non-clumping talc on your body&lt;br /&gt;to feel like you just walked out of a professional, old-tyme barber shop&lt;br /&gt;cool, fresh feeling balls all day&lt;br /&gt;to carry on the tradition of using old fashioned, best quality products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buy this stuff</li>
    <li> Brings back memoriea of sitting in the barbers chair and. The scent last a good amount of time over the course of the day.</li>
    <li> I use this talc in the morning and by the time I get to the gym at the end of he day I can still smell it. The scent is the traditional \\&quot;Clubman\\&quot;, so you know its good. This should be used after you shower as part of any man&#x27;s grooming arsenal.</li>
    <li> The product is real, arrived fast. 3 pack for the price of one to me was a great bargain. Fresh scent like the old school barber&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> what can I say, there&#x27;s a thousand uses for this stuff. I used it with peroxide to get stains out of granite.</li>
    <li> Best stuff on the market for keeping you smelling and feeling fresh after a shower. Same stuff your barber used when you were young.</li>
    <li> This is the nostalgic barbershop fragrance you are looking for. You almost want a piece of stale bubble gum after you put this on. Though I don&#x27;t have hair that requires cutting anymore, I use this everywhere else after a shower. And yes, it&#x27;s great for powdering the doughnuts; keeps me dry all day. The fragrance is an adequate strength to enjoy but not overwhelm. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it compared to the new men&#x27;s powders that have come out- which do the same thing, but this is the original and way more manly. My brother got me my first bottle as a gift, and though I used it almost everyday since Christmas, I am just now ordering. A three pack!? Hell yeah! I&#x27;ll be set for a couple years for thirteen bucks! Beat that hipsters!</li>
    <li> Average talc. I&#x27;m not so sure about \\&quot;clubman\\&quot;. The talc is pink, which doesn&#x27;t bother me so much besides the fact that it&#x27;s advertised for men. It also has a very feminine odor to it. Much like a perfume or perhaps more accurately a flower scented soap. It absorbs just fine. I think next time ill try Ballz Talc Powder. I got this instead b/c it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> Tired of smelling like a baby just because you want to use a little talc, well here is your answer.  Stay cool, dry and comfortable all while smelling like a man!</li>
    <li> this powder is pink and leaves pink stains all over my undershirts.  I used it years ago and don&#x27;t recall having this problem.  Love the smell, but hate the color effect!</li>
    <li> Love this talc and the scent.</li>
    <li> Great smell, and really goes a long way. I use it daily, and regret the days that I don&#x27;t</li>
    <li> Lets be honest here.  Eliminates &amp;#34;swamp ass&amp;#34; while allowing the boys to hang freely. I used this every day before work.</li>
    <li> Wonderful lightly scented talc that keeps your bits and pieces cool and dry during hot and humid conditions. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of the barbershop when I was a kid.  Great stuff!!!  I would highly recommend this to anyone that is interested.</li>
    <li> I thought I was purchasing three containers of 3 oz each that would equal a total of 9 oz. However, I received three containers of 9 oz each, a total of 27 oz. Great deal. However, I&#x27;m not sure I love it that much. I might give some away.</li>
    <li> What can I say about Clubman Pinaud Talc? My first experience with this was in the bathroom of our local Country Club.  The bathroom attendant would offer some and the scent was intoxicating to me.  After that when I found my barber of the last 20 years he always used it after the end of my cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t get enough of this scent.  It is so powdery and pleasant I wish I could re-apply all throughout the day! Does a great job of absorbing moisture and really helps to reduce friction in this private places.</li>
    <li> It reminds me of the days when we went to the barber shops and came out with that scent. Good memories.</li>
    <li> If you grew up with this stuff from an old school barber shop and liked it- then this is for you. Same distinctive scent and the powder works just fine...</li>
    <li> Using this powder most soitenly takes my mind back to the days when my dad took me to the village barber shop. Nowadys my wife cuts my hair in the back yard with the classic Oster 76 clippers. So when the cutting is done, my wife uses an old time barber&#x27;s neck brush and some of this powder just to make me feel good about getting my hair cut.</li>
    <li> It really is the &amp;#34;finest powder&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve been using Clubman Talc for years, and cannot go a day without it.</li>
    <li> This talc works great!  It get&#x27;s the job done right, it feels good on the skin, and it smells good too.</li>
    <li> I like this talc, it smells pleasant, and yet still masculine.  The only negative is that it is expensive for what you&#x27;re getting.  Even worse, now that Amazon no longer offers this as an &amp;#34;Add-On Item&amp;#34; to get free shipping.  Hopefully that will change.</li>
    <li> This is a great smelling talc!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my disabled son to keep him dry during the hot summer months it smells good but it turned my sons skin pink!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me - and I hope you&#x27;re nothing like me, for your sake - certain areas tend to get a little soggy in the summer.  (Who am I kidding?  It happens in the winter, as well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the longest time, I used the name-brand medicated talc for those areas and I loved it, until I found Clubman talc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clubman products are great and this talc is no exception.  It makes you feel clean and dry and you smell like a king.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will warn you, though, I have experienced some pinkish coloring on the underclothing of the areas where I sweat the most.</li>
    <li> Buy this for my beloved because I like him to smell like a new haircut!  The price for 3 was very good compared to other sights online.</li>
    <li> This is a great product I love it. it smells great and very soft powder. I&#x27;m going to reorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
    <li> Product has relieved problem caused by repetitive exercise.  I will continue to use it especially during the summer,spring,&lt;br /&gt;and fall.</li>
    <li> This is the finest talc I have ever used!  It has the most pleasant aroma and does the best job with absorbing moisture!  This is a must have for any gentle mans washroom!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Great for evenings before going to be bed to stay dry.  The scent is good and you get quite a bit for the money.  A good purchase.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hubby dry and smelling good.</li>
    <li> great men&#x27;s body talc.  Very comfortable, enjoyable and keeps you dry through out the day.  It is, however, not an underarm deodorant</li>
    <li> I use this daily to help stay dry as I tend to sweat profusely.  This helps keep the back of my undershirts from getting soaked and also keeps me from the sweat smell.</li>
    <li> Remember goin to the barber w/your father.This smells GREAT and the price for 3pkgs,GREAT deal!!</li>
    <li> Great smell, using every day. Sorry it took me nearly 48 years to find talc as part of my daily routine. Smells great and works with many manly aftershaves.</li>
    <li> Really like this product. It smells great, keeps you dry anywhere you put it.  Can be used as an underarm or anywhere deodorant.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  The scent it emits is pleasing and the feel in the crouch area is cool, literally.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast ,is pretty inexpensive and smells great. A clean smell like comming home,as a kid, on a Saturday afternoon from the barbers.&lt;br /&gt;A classic.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and use this everyday after my shower. It is getting hard to find in the drug store so I had to resort to on-line ordering. Everything came in as expected with no problems.</li>
    <li> my husband has used this for years. can&#x27;t seem to find it locally so thrilled that it came in a 3 pack. have purchase before and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great stuff at a great price.  Shipped fast,too.</li>
    <li> The smoothest, finest powder used by my barber and now I have it at home!  Citrus aroma, but smells manly.</li>
    <li> It smells so good, I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to get it! I Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Not bad. Not quite as good as goldbond as far as how good it works. Smell in my opinion is not great. Smells almost exactly like the old man cologne &amp;#34;brut.&amp;#34; That is all...</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. I won&#x27;t need any more for a while, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> one of the very few men&#x27;s face powders available for those of us alergic to alcohol lotions. Lo e the smell, too.</li>
    <li> I really like the Clubman products. This talc has a nice sent to it and is effective throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Very good talc powder in a classic barber shop scent.  Fairly good price for the pack of 3 which should last me a while.</li>
    <li> Old fashioned gentleman&#x27;s fragrance this talcum has!  A product of longstanding to gentlemen of distinguished tastes!  Ha!  It does what I want and was a great value, allowing me to buy 3 at a good price.</li>
    <li> I used to use this stuff all the time and  really liked it. Then I could not find it no matter where I looked. I&#x27;m glad I can order this fine product online. One thing I don&#x27;t understand. If most men really like this product, why the can&#x27;t I find it in stores like I used to?</li>
    <li> I bought this out of nostalgia mostly from when I was a kid at the barber shop.  I use a body powder every day.  (Usually the cheap house brand Walmart sells.)  I really like the fragrance of this, but realized after I got it, it was 100% talc.  Most others are mostly corn starch these days.  There are many articles about the dangers of using talc, so that worried me a bit, but mostly it didn&#x27;t seem to dry and comfort as well as the product I was using.  I bought 3 cans to get free shipping, so I gave them to my barber.  She still uses the stuff.</li>
    <li> This has an old school barber shop smell. The absolute best for keeping the manhood fresh. Buy this if you value your manliness.</li>
    <li> Best stuff on market!</li>
    <li> After my operation in my abdominal area that was shaved I need something to give me comfort. Using this powder in many conditons I find it is soothing, non-caking and offers comfort and a nice fragrance. Good product. Good price.</li>
    <li> Love the clean scent of this - my husband has been wearing this for over 30 years!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this powder.  He used to use baby powder until he tried this at a friend&#x27;s club.  This is all he uses.  He even pours it into a small travel container of baby powder to keep in his shaving kit when he goes out of town.  I&#x27;ve bought from this seller before and will again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Smooth, smells great and provides great comfort</li>
    <li> This powder is nice and clean smelling.It keeps you dry and fresh.(Not antiperspirant dry.) It&#x60;s good for after shower sprinkle all over.I keep one in my locker to stay fresh at work.</li>
    <li> Great for sweaty private areas :-) keeps you nice and dry. Also absorbs oil, I put it on my back and it helps with break outs.</li>
    <li> Love Clubman Pinaud reminds me when I would go the barber shop with my dad!</li>
    <li> awesome scent. takes me back to when I had my hair cut by actual barbers (which are increasingly hard to find nowadays).</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has confirmed this cures all swamp ass while maintaining its manlyness for a powder cosmetic.</li>
    <li> This is the best I with I could find it locally smells great</li>
    <li> Have used this powder for 40 years. Couldn&#x27;t find it for awhile then I started using amazon. Used in barber shops in the old days. My Italian barber always described it as the best made.</li>
    <li> Great classic barber shop scent that doesn&#x27;t smell like an old man. Can be used for younger adults or old men.</li>
    <li> Use it daily, wonderful product, brings back the smells of a barbershop when I was  kid.</li>
    <li> Great smell (reminds me of my great grandfather and barber shops) and terrific value.  Highly recommended companion to the Clubman after shave.</li>
    <li> after shower and shave it feels like I just left the barber shop.  very clean and pleasing sent wife really likes it too.</li>
    <li> Works great for Drysuit seals, plenty to share. Great price.</li>
    <li> treat your junk right. Be classy as heck.</li>
    <li> I love this Men&#x27;s talc. It has the rich smell of a quality talc without the any hint of &amp;#34;baby powder&amp;#34;. Helps keep me dry in the places that I need to be dry.</li>
    <li> One of the best purchases of my life. I put it on &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; after I take a shower and I&#x27;m fresh and dry all day. The smell is amazing. It smells just like a barber shop.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re dealing with foot or jock itch, like I was, this powder will dry out those areas so fungi can&#x27;t grow.  It also helps reduce sweat and keeps you smelling great.  My only complaint is that the holes on the cap are too large so a lot of powder comes out even when you&#x27;re trying to only get a little bit.</li>
    <li> This powder should be in every gentleman&#x27;s collection.  It is real talcum powder, not a cheap, corn starch substitute, The fragrance is also very elegant.  The three-pack is the perfect quantity for mail order, and the price was very good.</li>
    <li> While the texture of the powder is very smooth and silky, the fragrance is a bit too strong for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best for after shaving particularly in the summer. Keeps you cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it in your shoes etc. great all purpose powder that smells like an old barbershop in the best sense of the word.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Good price.</li>
    <li> Another product I have been using for years and have yet to find anything better.  I will continue purchasing and using this talc.</li>
    <li> feeling dry !!!!  The kids like it after their hair cuts, stops their itching and it makes mama happy so i am happy</li>
    <li> Love the refreshing smell after I shower...</li>
    <li> I really like the smell.  This is exactly the same stuff my barber uses.  I have to stop using it, however, because although it does a great job at keeping my skin dry and stink-free, I find that the chemicals that make it smell good tend to irritate my skin.  And since I&#x27;m using it on a sensitive area, that matters.</li>
    <li> I use this daily to powder my boxer briefs in the morning. I used to suffer from some chafing and now it&#x27;s totally resolved, when exercising etc. Where has this been all my life. Also, it smells amazing. Plus I smell like a grown up and not like baby powder.</li>
    <li> been using baby powder for years.  no longer.  This Clubman Pinaud is sensational.  After applying I can not stop touching myself.  Feels so smooth.</li>
    <li> It is Pinaud.Need I say More.Yes I must .They force you to type at least 5 sentences.So hey it is powder .It dries me up.It smells wonderful.The Ladies love it.Makes my Kielbasa look like a Big Casper the Friendly Ghost.It he is Friendly to the Ladies.That is all I have to say about that.I give it Ten Kielbasa&#x27;s.Toall my followers .I am starting my Ratings to Pierogies .From My Mom&#x27;Famous Cheese which will be Ten Stars to Saurkruat.Which will be Do Not Buy.This will be implemented in 2014.Or until I drop dead whichever comes 1st.

    <li> I really can&#x27;t get over how good this stuff smells.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s talc and it smells nice.  The price is right.  What more is there to say?</li>
    <li> Pleasant scent. I use it along with the Clubman aftershave and hair gel. Its hard to find a lot of the Clubman products locally and appreciate Amazon for making them available.</li>
    <li> This is the only talc powder my husband will use.  Have purchased others when he would run out and he always stopped using as soon as the Clubman came in.</li>
    <li> love this powder.  way better value for this 3 pack than the individual bottles in the store.  bought two 3 packs - kept one for myself and gave out the others to some guys in the family as part of the stocking stuffers</li>
    <li> Sorry, but I can&#x27;t give this one a pass. I have most of the Clubman products, and like quite a few of them, but not this one. I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or something, but when I wear it, I swear it smells like rotting meat or something along those lines. No other talcum powder has exhibited this that I have used.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s talc- not much more to say.  Smells like the after shave which smells like an old school barbershop.  If you don&#x27;t like that smell, this is probably not for you.  Doesn&#x27;t smell like baby powder or Gold-bond if that helps.</li>
    <li> This is the powder that my barber shop uses. I think it smells great, and it really does keep me feeling fresh all day. You can use it anywhere you want. I use it on my feet and to prevent swamp arse.</li>
    <li> Have loved the aroma of this talcum since childhood.  It&#x27;s hard to find in local pharmacies, especially now that they seem more interested in selling food.  Three cans at a very fair price was a plus.</li>
    <li> It is strong and pleasant but not too much so.  Will buy again if the company still makes the product.</li>
    <li> Got this about a week ago, using daily since and while I haven&#x27;t read every one, I do agree with all the many 5 Star ratings that I have read.</li>
    <li> I have used this powder for many years thanks to my barber.  At the end of every haircut he always dumped a little into a brush and applied the powder to my neck.  But I purchased it here because of the price.</li>
    <li> Of all the things you hope to be dependable in your life...this item remains tried and true. I use it all the time... wouldn&#x27;t walk a mile without it and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance ! Definetly reminds one of a barber shop . Great for overall body application and is a wonderful way to start your day ! Highly recommended ! Great value so be sure to stock up !</li>
    <li> A must for anyone in summer or a hot, humid climate.  The old guys knew what they were doing.  This will refresh you a couple of times a day in the heat of August.\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the best part is rekindling memories of barber shops as a kid.  There&#x27;s nothing like the smell of a vintage neck duster.</li>
    <li> This is really great.  It keeps you very comfortable and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this product</li>
    <li> The same rating applies to the talc as well as the after shave. Wonderful product. Good to have it back in my life.</li>
    <li> For years, I&#x27;d used Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s baby powder after the shower for...well...my johnson. I decided to try the Clubman based on the rave reviews it receives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m putting some reality into this review that may be lacking in so many other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as cost is concerned J&amp;J baby powder and Clubman are comparable; though, the baby powder may be slightly less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Physcially, I found Clubman to be slightly more tacky than the baby powder--meaning that the talc seemed to stick to my hands more than J&amp;J baby powder does.&lt;br /&gt;Also, J&amp;J baby powder has a much more faint scent. Clubman has a much stronger scent with far more sillage than baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the scent is concerned, because of the nostalgic association with barber shops, we perceive Clubman as a man&#x27;s scent. However, putting nostalgia aside and simply smelling this powder as it is, it&#x27;s quite \\&quot;powdery\\&quot; and could very easily pass as a unisex scent. It IS a fresh scent, but it&#x27;s not especially masculine as an odor. We perceive it as masculine because of it&#x27;s association with barber shops. In reality, the smell is mediocre, but it certainly does smell like an old time barber shop. It doesn&#x27;t really smell too different from baby powder; however, the baby powder scent is associated with infants. So we don&#x27;t perceive it as masculine. While on comparing tacls, I might as well mention that I&#x27;ve used Gold Bond medicated powder as well. I place Gold Bond in between Johnson&#x27;s Baby Powder and Clubman talc in regard to smoothness vs. stickiness (or tackiness). Clubman seems just sticky enough to sort of clump in the bottle so that when you go to pour it out, it behaves a little like the ice cubes in the bottom of your glass. It doesn&#x27;t pour out smoothly, but waits at the bottom until you shake it. When you shake it, it all at once shoots out of the openings in a pink cloud. Clubman tends to cling to your hands more than baby powder or Gold Bond. Gold Bond has a menthol coolness that some men find \\&quot;invigorating\\&quot;. If you like rubbing Ben-Gay on your nuggets, I guess you&#x27;ll really enjoy the Gold Bond experience. For those of us without that fetish, Gold Bond can be a little much in the beginning. Gold Bond works GREAT as a talc and it does the job of keeping the skin dry and lubricated; however, it does have a distinct medicine-like odor. It smells like something you&#x27;d put on a sports injury or something you&#x27;d buy at a pharmacy. Still, it&#x27;s a great talc and I&#x27;ve used it from time to time; however, I&#x27;m not a fan of the icy/hot feeling it gives my on my delicates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being the case--and setting Gold Bond aside because of the icy menthol tingle, I prefer the smoothness and subtlety of Johnson&#x27;s baby powder to Clubman in a blind comparison. However, reality is that we live in a world of connotations, perceptions, and associations. So while I think J&amp;J baby powder is a superior talc, I may continue to wear Clubman for awhile until I find a better smelling talc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, Clubman is no slouch of a talc. It is a fine talc and it definitely lives up to the job of keeping the skin dry and lubricated. It does have a decent odor too; thought, I don&#x27;t particularly care for it. It smells like a fresh haircut at a traditional barber shop. It may be inferior to J&amp;J baby powder but it&#x27;s definitely a close race between the two and any man can wear Clubman with confidence. If you want to smell like an 88 year old man, then Clubman is the talc for you. You have to be REALLY confident and sure of yourself to wear Johnson &amp; Johnson baby powder. Even then, you&#x27;ll still smell like a baby and while the other guys in the locker room might be afraid to say anything, they&#x27;ll be thinking you smell like a baby--not a man.menthol coolness that some men find \\&quot;invigorating\\&quot;. If you like rubbing Ben-Gay on your nuggets, I guess you&#x27;ll really enjoy the Gold Bond experience. For those of us without that fetish, Gold Bond can be a little much in the beginning. Gold Bond works GREAT as a talc and it does the job of keeping the skin dry and lubricated; however, it does have a distinct medicine-like odor.

    <li> I bought this after reading reviews. After a shower, there is nothing quite as satisfying as sprinkling this anywhere you may sweat. If you want to keep your junk dry and funk free, this is the way to go, particularly when it&#x27;s hot out.</li>
    <li> i love the smell of this product. it brings back memories of the old days of real barbershops. some reviews mentioned that this would make your clothes turn pink, but that&#x27;s only true if you over powder yourself. if you are moderate you will not have any problems. my bottle came as is picture.</li>
    <li> Pleasant scent,  feels clean,  ready to go in a jiff</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I use this daily.  It does smoothen places that need to be smooth.  Very soft and not-greasy or feeling sticky.  Will definitely buy more when I run out.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  Manly smelling and does a good job of keeping you dry.  It is faintly pink as some people have commented, but its not a big deal.</li>
    <li> Clubman talc has a nice aroma. It keeps you dry in warm weather.</li>
    <li> I use this when I get out of the shower and before I hit the bars so I can keep moisture levels to a minimum. I&#x27;m a big strong powerlifter and my downstairs mixup gets moist at the first sign of degree above freezing.</li>
    <li> It works great.  It also has a nice manly fragrance and doesn&#x27;t smell like medicine like Baby Gold-Bond does. It&#x27;s also 1/3 the price compared to CVS.  Walmart doesn&#x27;t sell it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be a smelly guy. Use this stuff.</li>
    <li> It smells great, it feels great. It is just Great :)</li>
    <li> Hope the manufacturer reads this.  Too fine.  Too easy to make a mess.  Difficult to clean up because it&#x27;s TOO FINE  The aroma is good.  The price is fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Just like my barber uses, great smell makes me barber shop fresh every morning. Very good quality best price I have found.</li>
    <li> my husband of almost 22 years has worn this since the day we met.....and continues to do so even today.  i hope it never goes out of stock.......</li>
    <li> My husband uses this product all the time.&lt;br /&gt;I love the silkiness and scent..&lt;br /&gt;He is very happy to have received it...</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Clubman Talc\\&quot; is a great product .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 65 + years old and find Clubman makes me comfortable where I sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the mild scent is just right.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband over two years ago, and have reordered it because he likes it so much.&lt;br /&gt;So, what&#x27;s the problem?  It&#x27;s the container which is poorly made.  The holes are way too large and dispense too&lt;br /&gt;much talc.  There should be a slide opening to control the amount of talc that comes out, or at the very least the holes should be smaller!  It isn&#x27;t healthy to inhale talc.&lt;br /&gt;If this can be accomplished by the manufacturer I&#x27;ll come back with five stars.</li>
    <li> My husband never tried this before- he LOVES it!  To be honost, I do too.  It smells great and works fantasticly!</li>
    <li> Smells great going on,  but does not hold up as a deodorant. I get compliments on the smell of the aftershave though. I&#x27;ll buy the aftershave again. Jim</li>
    <li> If you like the smell and feel after a haircut at a &#x27;real&#x27; barber shop, then you&#x27;ll love this powder. It takes me back to the days as a boy when my Dad and I would go together for a cut. This powder is also perfect for keeping cool and smelling great all over, anytime. After I started using Clubman Pinaud Talc...again, my wife said to me &amp;#34;Now that&#x27;s what a man is supposed to smell like.&amp;#34; It doesn&#x27;t get much better than that. Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years, but it&#x27;s  hard to find around here.  Nice, old timey, masculine smell.  Like the 3-pack.</li>
    <li> Other positive reviews on this items are correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My facial skin is a mixed skin; some areas are dry, and other areas are oily.  My solution is, I use my suntan lotion.  Wait few minutes, follow it up with a very thin layer of clubman.  The powder absorbs the excess oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This helps prevent the pimples I used to get in the oily areas on my face.</li>
    <li> Pretty good deal for 3 of these at the tune of 13$. I use the talc twice a day and go pretty much overboard with it. Have only been been told about it once by the wife. She likes it too</li>
    <li> This is an excellent powder for those like me who a good fresh feeling after showering and before getting dressed.</li>
    <li> Clubman has been around for a long time, and it lives up to its reputation. I use it as a skin refresher and deodorant and prefer it to sprays and deodorant sticks. The fragrance is traditional,  masculine barbershop which fits my  lifestyle and maturity.  I use Clubman for my everyday product, but switch to other products for special or more formal occasions  Also, Clubman is well priced and affordable. I definitely feel its a good buy.</li>
    <li> I put this all over after spray tanning, this also smells great</li>
    <li> I use this to give myself a break from using a antiperspirant before going to bed. Smells great and keeps me dry and comfortable all night.</li>
    <li> simply love it , been buying it for years , the only complaint I have is the top of the bottle . I think it needs to be redesigned or simply made to have better control over the way you shake it on , also once your done with it the flip cover does not clip closed correctly which is very annoying. But other than that I do recommend it .</li>
    <li> Is lasting forever, a little goes along way. I only give it a 4, because it turns my white undershirt pink, but that does wash completely out.</li>
    <li> You know I&#x27;m not really much of a after bath or shower powder kind of man.I&#x27;ve given Clubman Talc a shot and it smells great...just can&#x27;t stick to applying powder afterwards.As for myself Clubman Pinaud&#x27;s Talc Powder has one awesome purpose...kills foot odor in a shoe on a monumental level.I&#x27;ve tried Gold Bond and yeah it leaves that medicated scent but you can still smell foot odor under that layer of medication..just doesn&#x27;t work.The Talc Powder I&#x27;ve been using it for eight years now and it just leaves your shoes smelling clean and fresh with no foot odor.It&#x27;s hard to explain the scent of this stuff maybe mint and a little lilac.When you put your shoe on you cool that cooling sensation it leaves through your socks that&#x27;s why I claim menthol is in this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why not for &#x27;down there&#x27;?&lt;br /&gt;Well for starters it&#x27;s not a new fact or anything as it&#x27;s quite old but you don&#x27;t put talc on your privates region.It can reduce your sperm count and in cases the talc gets in your semen and has led to the cause of birth defects.I&#x27;ve heard testicular cancer but don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true but the rest IS FACT look it up.So I guess if you&#x27;re trying to stray from condoms just rub this on everyday for a decade.Can&#x27;t say you&#x27;ll be sterile or won&#x27;t jeopardize yourself or future children...but at least you&#x27;ll smell fresh.Oh and by the way I&#x27;m sure the lady (as another reviewer mentioned) putting her head in your lap will be able to &#x27;taste&#x27; the powder.Shower and trim fellas with a light spray of cologne...that&#x27;s the best both sexes can do.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of clubman talc, I also purchased a cheap duster that has a cap on the top so that you can fill it up with talc and apply it without getting it on your hand.  I use this product every morning after showering.  My barber also uses it on the back of my neck after a haircut.  If you want the old school barber shop smell that ladies love, buy this product.  I bought the 3 pack of talc so that I would have two on hand and my girl wanted some also.  I would also recommend clubman shampoo also if you like this scent.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I have been looking for in nice smelling talc. I use it every day and find it works well.</li>
    <li> The only talc I use.  Smells nice...Lasts all day.  Been around for years.</li>
    <li> If you need a talc then look no further than this product. It works great and the smell is not overwhelming. Plus if you are a old guy such as me, this will take you down memory lane to the time of your youth when you went to the barber for a cut and he put this talc on when you were done. It may even bring back memories  of your  youth  when life was so simple (games, swimming, bike riding, bugging girls, etc.)</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to open and use. Maybe less holes needed to dispense since it comes out a little quicker than needed most times. Great to use on humid days. Refreshing.</li>
    <li> Smells soo nice--back to the barber shop in the 1960s when men smelled like men.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I love it. A very masculine but mild scent and it really is comforting when the weather is hot and humid. My wife said &amp;#34;you smell some good&amp;#34; which pretty well says it all. It does remind me of the &amp;#34;barber shop&amp;#34;  smell also. I would recommend it to anyone and the price is fantastic.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, Clubman is the best talc out there for men to use on their body. It has a pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t have any menthol like Goldbond does. dont pay more than 5.00 for 9 OZ bottle. Sally&#x27;s is best place I found to get it.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for this product. If i&#x27;m in a hurry getting out of bed I just put the powder on and Bam!</li>
    <li> Not sure if I like the pink color to it.  The smell is not quite what I expected....I&#x27;ve smelled better powders.  Also, the talc is a bit gritty it seems.  Guess I&#x27;ll have to like it for a while...got a 3 pack.  Will probably try something else next time.  God Bless.</li>
    <li> It has an old fashioned barber shop smell, but really what I use it for is swampy groin.  The men out there know what I&#x27;m talking about.  Enough said.</li>
    <li> Smells great, good talc.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great to use after a close haircut.  This brand has been around almost as long as Hair cuts.  Your neck will love you for using it.</li>
    <li> No other talc comes close to this !</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product, he will not use anything else.  I hope it will always be available to purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Smells like my Grandfather did. But that&#x27;s ok, since I&#x27;m now a grandfather too! Last forever!</li>
    <li> Decent deal I could have gotten a little cheaper locally, but I was lazy. Great talc and use it in a dispenser brush. Great for after giving myself a haircut or powdering my balls after a shower. Smells great.</li>
    <li> This talc is everything it claims to be - finely ground (excellent post-shave), fragrant (smells like Pinaud Clubman after shave) and absorbent. The lock is the price. This powder runs over $11 per unit at the Wal**reens here in town. Like a three for one sale.</li>
    <li> We love this talc and usually buy it at the flee market but Amazon had a good price for this three pack.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years for dog smell and really works after a good bath and keeps the dogs smelling good for a long time</li>
    <li> Keeps my sweaty man-bits perfectly dry for hours on end in the most ridiculous humidity known to man! Even in the 99.9% humidity that is the great state of Florida! 5/5 would purchase again!</li>
    <li> Best powder ever, smells great!!!</li>
    <li> Pretty much exactly as advertised.  It&#x27;s talcum powder, it&#x27;s great for keeping your bits and pieces nice and dry and free of smelly sweat, and it smells like a barbershop.  It&#x27;s bright pink, oddly enough.</li>
    <li> I use this in place of deodorant</li>
    <li> Tough to find talc powder. The product is fine, though the name and graphic are not appealing at all. Ladies may also use this fancy powder.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just the best.  Whatever your mood, it will lift you up, and that&#x27;s without even inhaling it.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this for him many times!  I would recommend it to anyone who likes a fine talc with a light fragrance.  It&#x27;s a great produce and great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linda</li>
    <li> The talc powder is very fine and hiqh quality, very soft and not gritty at all.  Also the fragrance is nice and clean smelling, but subtle enough not to be over powering.  I use this with a neck brush when getting dressed in the morning.</li>
    <li> The smell brings me back to my childhood and trips to the barbershop. The smell is just as I remembered. I like the clean smell. It&#x27;s not overpowering, it&#x27;s the right balance. I bought the 3-pack which is a better deal than getting just 1.</li>
    <li> ...and those Grampa-gulches that need a bit of dusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is neither overwhelming nor offensively perfumy.  Perfect.  A+, and the price is great!</li>
    <li> If you love the smell of the barber shop and the fresh feeling of baby powder buy this product. That is all.</li>
    <li> I love it, it is just what the doctor ordered.  I powder daily with it. i wish i had found this product sooner</li>
    <li> This was just what I thought it would be.  Terrific smell, super fine talc.  Love it and will order it again.</li>
    <li> Been using the product for years and love it</li>
