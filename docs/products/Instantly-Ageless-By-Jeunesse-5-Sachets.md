      <li>All in all, this product would be good for a man who doesn&#x27;t want to wear makeup or a women who doesn&#x27;t want to wear make up and enjoys resting b***h face all day, every day.</li>

      <li>Good</li>
      <li>This is perfect for those special occasions like a class reunion.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even have very many wrinkles around my eyes, but I tried it out to see if it did anything for me.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased.</li>
      <li>It works great most of the time.  </li>
      <li>Great products, I love them.</li>
      <li>Okay not as great as I hoped.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>

      <li>Absolutely love it!  </li>
      <li>Amazing results which I had doubts that it work so well.</li>
      <li>Works really good, better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before</li>
      <li>so when I smiled it accented my wrinkles</li>
      <li>Wish I could say I liked it</li>
      <li>Kind of overpriced  </li>
      <li>It would have been really nice to have received some sort of instructions with this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s effective for that time.</li>
      <li>but the minute you hydrate your skin - it kind of reverses.  </li>
      <li>There were no instructions or written material of any kind.  </li>
      <li>So the two sachets were, without a doubt, the most effective cosmetic I have ever tried the</li>
      <li>A bottle of Elmer&#x27;s glue is more cost effective.</li>
      <li>it does diminish wrinkles but it is more effective if you do not have a severe case of them.</li>
      <li>I have very fine lines around my eyes and forward</li>
      <li>My mother was super excited to try this out, since it had such wonderful reviews and a video proving it was awesome! ...</li>
      <li>Great product and very fast shipping.</li>
      <li>They are super pasty, buy the vials not these !!</li>
      <li>he asked me to buy a huge box for her!</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Where have you been all my life :)</li>
      <li>Probably best used for deeper wrinkles that aren&#x27;t as affected by facial expression.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Will be buying more.</li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>Make sure the product is wetter rather than drier when applying</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Absolutely LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>I guess I need more bags under the eyes.</li>
      <li>It sure did not work as well as they said.</li>
      <li>Maybe I need more training, takes a lot to cover my problem areas.</li>
      <li>It felt more like i put elmers glue on my face.  </li>
      <li>Oh sure, the liquid does minimize winkles and bags.</li>
      <li>I love the product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad this product exists</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product does not work.  It just le aves a white paste mark on your face.</li>
    <li> The item would be great. It really does work but it only last about an hour. If it could last at least 8 hours it would be great.</li>
    <li> I love the product. I will buy it again in the future.</li>
    <li> The shipping, packaging etc was excellent.  The product really does work very well.  My only complaint is it does tend to cake up a bit.</li>
    <li> Wonderful results. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> This product is a SCAM.  Do not waste your money</li>
    <li> A great product. It really worked as well as they said it would. But, don&#x27;t put too much on or it turns white!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money - seller is great but product is not.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work like the u tube video showed</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this item! It didn&#x27;t work at all!</li>
    <li> I did not receive vials I received samples that said not for sale! Total rip off!</li>
    <li> It does get rid of the winkles, but one you start smiling they seem to come back, also when it drys on your face it leaves a film,</li>
    <li> The product is good but don&#x27;t expect changes on deep lines without leaving a white film residue from having to over apply the product.</li>
    <li> Works really good, better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before</li>
    <li> Not really for older women. I found that it just pulled my sagging bags a little. I can see where it would work for younger women. Not for me. I&#x27;m 65.</li>
    <li> Oh sure, the liquid does minimize winkles and bags. What isn&#x27;t mentioned is that it dries to a thin she&#x27;ll-like coating. It doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; to the touch and the minute any facial muscles are flexed, it forms tiny cracks that are visible. Makeup? Don&#x27;t even try to put any type of make on over this stuff. It is NOT invisible. And the cracks show clearly through any powder makeup applied. Creams of any kind (including eye and face makeup), remove this worthless product, as do water and tears. Waste of $$$</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.  I saw a very small improvement. The product leaves a white residue on the area applied and my dry skin was even drier after application.</li>
    <li> i DID NOT WORK FOR ME THE WAY IT SHOWED IN THE VIDEO.</li>
    <li> Does make a visible difference but after aboutique 4  hours it tends to crystallize a bit and get grainy looking</li>
    <li> it does diminish wrinkles but it is more effective if you do not have a severe case of them.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works and it is reasonably priced.  Timely delivery</li>
    <li> This is perfect for those special occasions like a class reunion. It helps reduce those wrinkles. Also it helps to brighten up those tired eyes. I tried it over makeup and got the same effect. Love!</li>
    <li> Did a very good job on lines and great job on puffy eyes....took a couple times to get it right but it was me not the product ......once got the how to down , great job....have told friends to buy it.  Just wish it was in stores but it came in a few days but would be nice to go to Walgreens to get.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s was awesome I really liked it !!!</li>
    <li> Love the product so far.</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely nothing for me except make my skin feel tight like I had applied glue</li>
    <li> Okay not as great as I hoped.</li>
    <li> Garbage. It leaves a white powdery residue no matter how tiny of an amount I try to use. It might shrink your bags by 5% but then it gives you a million little wrinkles under your eyes instead. Just like all the other garbage I&#x27;ve tried for bags, same exact crap. Im 32 years old and suffer from hereditary bags, so no matter how much sleep I get I always look tired. I wish I could find a product that actually works and doesn&#x27;t leave residue and give you wrinkles you didn&#x27;t have in the first place</li>
    <li> This product does work but......flakes off after a few hours!!&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy this product again!!</li>
    <li> this product is amazing!  really works!</li>
    <li> I received &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; packages instead of &amp;#34;vials&amp;#34; that I ordered.  Also it&#x27;s not identified on the product that is indeed by Jeunesse, and the product itself seems old.  When I went to use it, it turned a light chalky color on my face &amp; cracked, making it obvious there is something there.  I used one packet, and let my boyfriend use another, and haven&#x27;t touched them since.  Definite waste of money, and super disappointed with the product.  However I&#x27;m unsure if I was delivered the quality product, or just some old free samples that were lying around :(</li>
    <li> Did not care for the texture. It was pasty and I did not notice it lift and smooth as I thought it would.  Had seen it in a video and was impressed. Did not deliver as in the video at all.</li>
    <li> Misleading, these are not vials as the title and description states, these are sample packs that are not supposed to be sold.</li>
    <li> It worked exactly as it said it would.  I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! It really works!</li>
    <li> This product really make diference in your face, but the reason why I give 4 stars is the application is too small and you can use 2 or 3 times each tube. But its work</li>
    <li> Did nothing I would never purchase it again.  Still have three unused.</li>
    <li> Lasts about a day. It&#x27;s effective for that time. And I think maybe it has decreased the overall dark circles to some degree.</li>
    <li> If you had a zero stars rating that is what it deserves No change at all. Terrible rip-off.</li>
    <li> excellant!  Where have you been all my life :)</li>
    <li> It tightens well but the sachet dries up by the next application and it leaves your skin yellow</li>
    <li> Horrible. Burned my eyelid.</li>
    <li> This works well but is difficult to get the exact amount needed to tighten the skin without overdoing it. I had to wash it off and start over after using too much, which tightened the skin under one eye so much that it pulled the skin at the outer corner and made my eye appear droopy.</li>
    <li> temp results but they are noticeable.  will buy again</li>
    <li> made me look worse!  Weird ... like a dried out face mask????</li>
    <li> Although you can feel the tightening effect there is NO difference in appearance.  Used for several days and took pictures before and after.  Pictures were taken at make up mirror and a different day lying down.</li>
    <li> Took a long time to get here.  There were no instructions or written material of any kind.  Felt it working a bit, but nothing really helpful.</li>
    <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t buy more.</li>
    <li> I got a sample and Yes it tightened my skin temporarily and felt a little weid because I onlly used it under my eyes and not on the rest of my skin.  It feels just like egg whites.  Take egg whites whip them up and smear it on your face.  As it dryes your face will tighten up real tight.  That;s what it feels like.</li>
    <li> First off the packaging was different than in the photo! Secondly printed all over the sample packets was clearly written NOT FOR RESALE!!! And the product is just a tacky dry blob. I&#x27;m very disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! At first I ordered a 5 packet trial and I was sold. This cream is worth the price and that is saying a lot from me because I won&#x27;t even spend more than $10 on foundation.</li>
    <li> This is nothing special. used it for a few days and it was okay but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  j</li>
    <li> Good but don&#x27;t use too much because you going to have white residu and makes your under eyes dry.</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  Product seemed old.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work! Such a waste of money!</li>
    <li> this anti-aging serum(jeunesse) not good at all, like we see it in the video, I think they give the rhong serum</li>
    <li> I GOT LIKE SAMPLE PACKETS. Not at all like what was pictured. smaller amount in this packet,&lt;br /&gt;very disappointed in the supplier and the misleading info about the size and what&#x27;s pictured.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come in the package advertised.</li>
    <li> as a supposed &amp;#34;miracle product&amp;#34;  I have used hemorrhoid cream with better results.  DON&#x27;T  waste your money.</li>
    <li> This product is a joke. I would never purchase it again. It is basically a concealer with a glue type consistency.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. Very clumpy and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> It works beautifully...took a couple try&#x27;s to apply correct amount, but over all the product performs well!</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference</li>
    <li> Not a great bargain, you don&#x27;t use much but it dries in the open tube to fast to use it all.</li>
    <li> Bought product for a relative who absolutely loved it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it!  100% worth every penny for sure!</li>
    <li> It worked for about 20 minutes and then everything was just back to normal.  Also, there is no &#x27;cap&#x27; on it so it dries out immediately and is really only good for a couple of uses.  Not something I would purchase again!</li>
    <li> Terrible,  Horrible, worthless product!  Don&#x27;t buy unless you like wasting your money!  I&#x27;d give this product NO stars if it have me the option!</li>
    <li> No it&#x27;s not even a gel. It a lotion that dries up horribly! Do my wastes your money.</li>
    <li> Poor, there was no difference for me and I have minimal eye bags</li>
    <li> looked like Elmer&#x27;s glue on my face.</li>
    <li> This product definitely works but after 20 mins or so, I was left with a dry, crusty film under my eye.&lt;br /&gt;Wish someone would tell me how to get rid of that, then the product would be perfect.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good stuff...Kind of overpriced  though ..20 dollars for 5 tiny vials</li>
    <li> The video of this PRODUCT was good it worked great on her .&lt;br /&gt;You need to try it .</li>
    <li> I purchased this for myself but after doing some research I did find out this is for older people. With a lot more bags and deep wrinkles. not for younger skin with fine lines and small wrinkles. I did however use this on my mom. It truly does work. I really wanted to post the pic of my mom but she asked me not too. lol...but this really mad her look 10 years younger. the few things we didn&#x27;t like is we noticed it dried on her forehead and left residue and you could see it just a bit. and I do not like the new packets. It took 3 just to do her entire face. you do have to pat it and not rub it in. I would like more product for the price. my dad was in shock he couldn&#x27;t believe how she had no more wrinkles. he asked me to buy a huge box for her! lol...she did look great and you do get a good amount of time of wear with this product. we did not however put makeup on after this because my mom very seldom wears makeup. so i can&#x27;t say it holds up after putting makeup on because we did not test that. over all great product. very impressed!</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t use anything else on your face (like moisturizer) you can see a difference but the minute you hydrate your skin - it kind of reverses.  I can&#x27;t imagine anyone with lines/wrinkles doing away with their moisturizers so I can&#x27;t recommend it.  WAY overpriced.</li>
    <li> Great product and very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered on time and as usual I like the results it provides.</li>
    <li> These are one time use, they are samples (not for resale ) So you don&#x27;t get more that one use . U can actually buy viles with caps for less $ .</li>
    <li> Crap! Don&#x27;t buy! They are super pasty, buy the vials not these !!</li>
    <li> It does leave a cakey type residue. But it does work!!!!</li>
    <li> Waste of time and money. Customer service was good though.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I gave it one star for trying. Terrible product</li>
    <li> Overrated. The skin under my eyes looked salt stained as if I had been crying. It was an expensive lesson.</li>
    <li> Arrived early than expected. Great.</li>
    <li> Instantly ageless serum is worthless,wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I used the item as described, first with a small amount, to insure that it didn&#x27;t go on in a &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; like fashion as some people described. There were no noticeable results. I used more the next time, there was a slight stiffness from the product, so I didn&#x27;t want to exceed that amount. There was minimal, if any difference. The area directly below my eyes that I most wanted improved did no change at all. I tried a few more times, with the same outcome. I am only 30, and have minimal eye baggage or wrinkles, so perhaps this product would work better on those with more lines, but it hardly seems worth it to me, as even when I only do one eye, you can&#x27;t see a visible difference between the two, and the area I wanted improved does not firm up or change at all.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I feel the need to do it this time. I was very disappointed with the product, because when you applied it it&#x27;s great but as soon as you put make on it disappears, specially if you use a liquid foundation. Also it doesn&#x27;t last 8 hours, even with no make up, the bags come back 2 or 3 hours after.</li>
    <li> It totally works! But each packet can be used only once. It drys out. Love the product.</li>
    <li> After viewing the ad for this product, I ordered seven sachets to try them out.  They arrived quickly and there were 2 connected sachets and 5 connected.  I tried one of the packets of two first.  I have allergies and SERIOUS baggy eyes with dark circles--usually I wear glasses to hide my eyes.  When I tried this product the first time, there was a tingling, almost stinging sensation for a few minutes and the results were unbelievable fantastic!  The bags and dark circles under my eyes disappeared in 10 minutes.  My family was amazed.  I was thrilled! However, after using the two sachets (they lasted about 3 days each), I moved on to the strip of five and sadly, they are not effective.  They look the same, the product appears to be the same, but there is no tingle and it feels like the ingredient that makes it work is weak.  There is a slight improvement but not sufficient to justify the cost.  So the two sachets were, without a doubt, the most effective cosmetic I have ever tried the but next five were not.</li>
    <li> Ok, but not much different than another product available at drug store.&lt;br /&gt;If you are just curious, buy one or two tubes and try if first before buying it in quantity.</li>
    <li> waste of money complete garbage total lie. when putting on the product it definitely tightens and changes the look of your face. however once face is tightened you can not smile, laugh, or even talk. If you do the product starts to flake and you wind up looking like you have cap all over your face.  Do not purchase</li>
    <li> It made feel like the area where I applied it was burning my skin</li>
    <li> Did not  meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very sticky and leave the film on your face</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a plastic surgeon in a packet this product is not for you! I saw noticeable results which made me happy! I did not experience any flaking as I read In Previous reviews. It made me happy and suggest you give it a try it&#x27;s not expensive and I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Love the price I got on this.</li>
    <li> Was ok until I put foundation and it seemed to be flaky under my eye</li>
    <li> Omg it worked! I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it had I not done it myself! Only bought the product out of curiosity because I saw it on fb. But it really worked wonders on my 63 yr old mom!!!!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the results.  It sure did not work as well as they said.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Did not do what was shown in the video</li>
    <li> I like it, and it does diminish the bags and wrinkles, but it dries white and flaky, I even tried putting moisturizer on and it didn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> Wow, I totally fell for the videos online! this product does not work!  I do not even have much for bags under my eyes.  If it did anything it was gone once my skin moved then I looked more wrinkled! DON&#x27;T BUY!</li>
    <li> Prduct was a little dried out didn&#x27;t work very well, had white  flaky residue once it set.</li>
    <li> Have tried 4 of the 5 samples .. Maybe I need more training, takes a lot to cover my problem areas. Like the way it feels.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in aluminum sample packs containing approximately 2 applications instead of tubes as shown in the advertisement. This is very misleading.</li>
    <li> Did exactly as it says it would!  Was quite amazed.</li>
    <li> High hopes were let down. Only gave two stars cause... maybe I could see a tiny bit of improvement. I am searching for something fantastic and this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do nothing for me. It&#x27;s like it glues my face exactly how it was.</li>
    <li> When you first apply it, it feels like a miracle but, once you put on your make up it breaks down the effect. Not worth the money spent.</li>
    <li> Not quite as dramatic as the video but there are some changes when applied, but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fake !!! Make my eyebag more darker!!!!</li>
    <li> Big disappointment. Definietly not worth the money the money</li>
    <li> Does  not do as it says.  Mary Kay works as well and is less expensive</li>
    <li> it was thick n pastey, if you didn&#x27;t use all of the vital at once it dried out overnight, won&#x27;t be getting any more</li>
    <li> Waste of money! Glad I only bought 5 sachets. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. It does not work at all.</li>
    <li> Product works but not as drastic as it shows on the videos. Goes on smooth under make up</li>
    <li> Unfortunately got really bad allergies...&lt;br /&gt;Itching, swollen, puffy eyes.&lt;br /&gt;So if you think you have sensitive eyes like me.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> I like the product, it does help.  It is not the miracle product it claims to be and It leaves a residue behind.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes wrinkles go away until U smile or laugh then it looks HORRIBLE!</li>
    <li> Although this is a good price to sample this product, Its very hard to get the right amount on for it to work, or look right. In my opinion its too much trouble, to do, and it doesn&#x27;t last. Plus, the bigger box of them is much more expensive, it works out to about 5.00 a vile.  I&#x27;d rather have something to put on my face that would help over time to get rid of wrinkles, and something that is more natural. I will keep trying to find something that works for me.</li>
    <li> This did not work at all!</li>
    <li> Did not, in any way, meet my expectations! Lasted about 20 minutes as long as you don&#x27;t move your face or try to put foundation on over it!</li>
    <li> It worked great for my sister.  Me not so much.  I guess I need more bags under the eyes.</li>
    <li> It did work but only for a few hours. I don&#x27;t wear make up and it left a white powdery residue around my eyes. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I recieved the product and it wasn&#x27;t what I expected was a very small sample packet not like the picture. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> It does work, but it takes the whole vile per use, unlike the video claimed (2-3 uses per vile).&lt;br /&gt;And it dried my skin out a lot.&lt;br /&gt;But I WILLl use it on certain occasions.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with results</li>
    <li> This is a great product when used sparingly.  It took a couple of applications before I got the hang of how to apply.  Once you open a tube, plan to use it all, over the next couple of days.  I opened a tube to use it and saved the remainder for the weekend.  By the time I got around to finishing it off, it was hard as a rock and almost impossible to get out of the packet.</li>
    <li> Dryed skin like an invisible mask so when I smiled it accented my wrinkles</li>
    <li> This product is terrible! Looks like you have glue on your face! I tried using less/more and it didn&#x27;t work. Hate it! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Was very thick and flesh toned.  Did not do as well as the videos claim.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t same item as shown. Small littke packets that cannot be closed. Def not as advertised</li>
    <li> worked better then I thought it would</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but the product does work very great, watch the videos to make sure you put the right amount on though.</li>
    <li> If you put this on before makeup and then put your makeup on you rub off the product. If you put your makeup on first and then the product you look like some put glue under your eyes.</li>
    <li> we received the package- it was described as 5 vials but in actuality it is in several sample packets. The description for this product is misleading.</li>
    <li> Disappointed.  Product didn&#x27;t work.  Waste of money</li>
    <li> This was very disappointing. It is essentially the same result as putting egg white on your face. It leaves a strange glossy layer on your face that tightens, lessening the appearance of wrinkles....Until you move your face, or put makeup on, then it&#x27;s over.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trial pack after seeing so many miracle videos on social media.  I have minimal bags and very little to no dark circles.  Since the videos I watched starred women with much worse under eye problems I thought this may work really well on my small problem.  I saw some results but very very little.  I am glad there are people out here offering the trial pack and I didn&#x27;t spend my money on the more costly version.  I will admit there could be some operator error on my part since there are no directions on how to use the product.  After seeing so many videos I figured that I could figure it out.  I used varying amounts at different times just to play around with this and had the same results.  It does feel tighter under my eyes and leaves a chalky feel which I would gladly take if the results were like what I&#x27;ve seen on social media but they just aren&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see much difference except that it leaves residue</li>
    <li> not really what it claims to be, not near as good as seen on ads</li>
    <li> PRODUCT DOESN&#x27;T WORK AND WASN&#x27;T PACKAGED AS EXPECTED</li>
    <li> Did not see that much difference and it crumbled off when I applied concealer</li>
    <li> Was not pleased and for the price, way over- priced .</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and the product is amazing!! Thank you</li>
    <li> Worked great for my need.</li>
    <li> Followed directions and was amazed at how quickly it worked - problem is it only lasted about 30 minutes and my eyes looked even worse than they did to begin with. Glad I only got a small order.</li>
    <li> Did not work.  Left skin looking ashy.</li>
    <li> This product works exactly as it claims. My only complaint is that it does not work long enough...my results lasted only 4 hours per application.</li>
    <li> I tried wearing makeup it flake up it looked bad.</li>
    <li> Wow!!! It truly works, I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Works just like stated!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product.  Takes the wrinkles away before your eyes.</li>
    <li> Glad I only bought the sample! This product left a residue making makeup application impossible. I didn&#x27;t even notice a difference in my wrinkles either. It felt more like i put elmers glue on my face.  Don&#x27;t waste your money. Unless you have great skin and don&#x27;t require makeup, this will be a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I am Using and marketing L&#x27;dara now. L&#x27;dara active ingredient is LBP-5 derived from the Goji Berry. Your child can use it and works on all your wrinkles and perfects young skin. Day,Night,Eye.Imperfections and Primer all in one. Amazing!  L&#x27;dara!  Go to. Texas.Ldara.com</li>
    <li> It works great! does exactly what they claim. Sadly, after waiting more than 20 minutes to guarantee it was completely dry, as soon as I  made any type of facial expression it cracked and made the area look more wrinkly :( I guess if you don&#x27;t plan on squinting or showing any expression at all it would be fine. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Left a white film (old product?)</li>
    <li> I did not see any change.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, time to reorder</li>
    <li> Great product, prompt delivery</li>
    <li> Was not happy with product, did not last very long. I least expected a few hours.</li>
    <li> It leaves a slight film which is ok - otherwise, it delivers and firmed up my under eye.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after seeing all the videos for it online. My mother was super excited to try this out, since it had such wonderful reviews and a video proving it was awesome! ... Well, it wasn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s horrible &amp; DOES NOT WORK!! I don&#x27;t even have very many wrinkles around my eyes, but I tried it out to see if it did anything for me. NOPE! It just made my face more wrinkly than what it was and made me look so much older!! I would NOT recommend anyone trying this product out. It&#x27;s a TOTAL FAIL!!!</li>
    <li> People..........the simplest way to get these small sachets to last is to poke a needle or pin into one side (do not go all the way thru both sides of package) and then when you use what you want place a piece of scotch tape over the hole.  The product stays moist and fresh and can be used several more times.  It will last you ALOT longer this way!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the dryness and powdery residue that sometimes shows up....I lightly layer &amp;#34;Maybelline Baby Skin Instant Pore Eraser&amp;#34; over it.  I dab and rub the pore eraser lightly over the white spots and it gets rid of the residue without totally removing the product.  Then I put my foundation on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works to instantly improve lines....but of course it&#x27;s temporary.  You just need to play around a bit so it works for you and doesn&#x27;t come out caked looking.  I&#x27;ve also seen people put a dab or two on over foundation for the deeper wrinkles we get between the eyes.  Make sure the product is wetter rather than drier when applying and I usually blow dry my face on COLD till it dries.</li>
    <li> I could not tell any difference.</li>
    <li> It didnot work as shown . i advice others not to buy it</li>
    <li> Wrinkles gone, now look like a $1.98.</li>
    <li> This product does work but it leaves a white residue and when trying to apply make-up it then removes. So I wont be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> It leaves a dry looking film on your face that flakes up and cracks.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time but the listing is a little misleading. It should state that these aren&#x27;t full vials, but rather samples.</li>
    <li> i like it but once open and you just use what you need for that day the small tube stays open...  So when i go back to use again it&#x27;s dry and falky...</li>
    <li> Not impressed, have not seen any changes</li>
    <li> It did not work period terrible product</li>
    <li> It does work until you change expressions .also the shop I got mine from listed vials and then informed me it was little pouches she took 15$ off not sure that was comparable to others for same product . I ordered twice 1 was for 10 sachets half of those were empty</li>
    <li> I really didnt see any difference besides a dryness around my eyes.</li>
    <li> worked great. i will continue to order more.</li>
    <li> it not what it say .. flakes off  dont buy it</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t live up to all the hype. I have fine lines and it looked great after application on a straight face, but as soon as I smiled, it made my wrinkles look worse. Probably best used for deeper wrinkles that aren&#x27;t as affected by facial expression.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first. But once I learned how much to put on ( It&#x27;s a fine line between not enough and too much) it was fantastic!! I could feel it pulling in my skin! It really does work and removes any wrinkles and bags.</li>
    <li> Was advertised as 5 vials. Came in 5 tiny sample packs like out of a magazine insert..should have returned it !!  Did NOT work!!</li>
    <li> I figured spending $15 for a few of these samples was worth it instead of dropping $60.  I WOULD NOT buy this product again.  It came with instructions and I followed them to a tee.  Yes, it minimized the appearance of wrinkles.  However, what it fails to tell you is its like putting glue on your face.  Did you ever put glue on your skin when you were a kid and when it dried, your skin was sucked tight where the glue was?  This is EXACTLY what it does.  If I wanted a product like this, I would go and buy a 50 cent bottle of Elmer&#x27;s and pat some of that on under my eyes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great if you never want to smile or make any other expression. Look amazing while being completely stoic. Once you smile or laugh everything looks worse. Might work well in areas that don&#x27;t have movement?</li>
    <li> If I could have given a lower rating I would have. This stuff is crap! It was like having a mask on! You could not have any sort of facial expression after it dried,it was like having super glue in your face. I rate this a negative100!! I was robbed of my money!</li>
    <li> Really does work! Love it! Definitely didn&#x27;t think I would! Haha</li>
    <li> Worked a little on puffiness. Tube dries out before you can get multiple uses out of it.</li>
    <li> The samples arrived on time and were exactly what I ordered. The product works well but it&#x27;s probably not wise to wear it without makeup because it leaves a little white residue on your face.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for us even after following all the youtube tutorials.  Oh well..at least we gave it a shot.</li>
    <li> I saw a difference right away! I try all anti aging products constantly! For an instant fix it is worth it!</li>
    <li> Worked great, but reason for only 4 stars is that it is very drying to the skin.  If you want to get rid of fine lines &amp; wrinles, undereye bags and puffiness and such for a special occasion Definitely order as it does this within minutes of application and lasts about 10-12 hours, so it will definitely last even thru an all day wedding. Possibly if you have very oily skin, the dryness would become a benefit and you could use it everyday.  If you normally have dry skin, I would moisturizer your skin really well before applying.  My skin is usually neither oily or dry.  If you want more than 1 use out of the tube don&#x27;t cut the top off, pierce the tube near the top with a safety pin and squeeze the lotion out of this hole then when done, put a piece of tape over the pinhole.  I also wish it came in a squeeze tube with a cap. Bottom line is that I have tried everything under the sun to try to get rid of the bags under my eyes and this is the only product that I&#x27;ve tried that instantaneously got rid of them (at least for 12 hours.)</li>
    <li> Did not work as expected, and it did not last the 8 hours like it was suppose to.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> It works great most of the time.  Very expensive for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> These were not Vials, they were sachets.  Fortunately, because of the picture of the items, I expected sachets. I love this product.</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t what it appears to be.  My husband has used it faithfully and the bags are there.</li>
    <li> Absolutely awful. Do not buy this cr@p paste! Does not even work in the slightest, after applying it it feels like drywall pulling you skin tight but doesn&#x27;t actually show any signs of making your skin look better! It looks pasty and powdery when it drys like a baking soda paste would! Terrible, terrible, terrible! I even tried to keep applying it for a few days to see if it would have any positive effect if I was consistent with it, but nope! Waste of money. I&#x27;m quite irritated the videos and advertisements show such beautiful results, wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if it actually did that? Also it&#x27;s pricey! For a packet of gunk!</li>
    <li> Amazing results which I had doubts that it work so well.</li>
    <li> I bought the smallest amount because I was skeptical.  It&#x27;s amazing!!!!!!  I will definitely buy again!!</li>
    <li> This worked but is very drying for my skin.  I have an issue with alcohol content.  I also had the issue with it turning white, which was weird...but it does work.  You have to use a fresh packet every time, using the day old when the packet was opened is when it turned white</li>
    <li> To me, this is liquid gold ! I have bags every morning and this does the trick and lasts almost all day! Used to use Sudden Change, but this stuff makes Sudden Change look awful ! The residue from it is terrible, but instantly ageless is a cream and no rough residue under eyes ! Try a sample and you will see</li>
    <li> This product did not help.  I would give it zero stars.  It does nothing for the under eye bags but create a crusty film. Ugh a big waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product works, it does leave a white chalky look.  If you work with it, it is easier to use with a fan for faster drying and faster results.  Put it on before your makeup and no worries with the white dry powder, if you use liquid foundation it will blend in.  It works great with lines also.  You dont get much in these sachets the vials are better.</li>
    <li> Horrible product used as directed, very cakey even using the small amount and did absolutely nothing for forehead lines.  Would not recommend and save your money!</li>
    <li> Results only last 1/2 hour</li>
    <li> This product works very well - and requires no attention during the day. I am very pleased. It is not a permanent fix and is not intended to be but it does minimize the bags under my eyes. I apply it over my makeup.</li>
    <li> It does what it claimed to do, but as soon as you make any kind of facial movement, it stops working. I&#x27;ve also found that you can&#x27;t use liquid foundation with it because it stops working. If you put it on over moisturizer it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  It also leaves a film under your eyes after a few hours.  All in all, this product would be good for a man who doesn&#x27;t want to wear makeup or a women who doesn&#x27;t want to wear make up and enjoys resting b***h face all day, every day.</li>
    <li> this is nothing special its the same stuff that you could order on HSN it does tighten a little bit but really not that big of a deal would not waste my money again. a tiny bit is all you need but if you use too much it will leave white crusties feels like paste on your eye. I mixed it with my own moisturizer and on its own. Better mixed. but still would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Very impressed! Will be buying more. It works!!</li>
    <li> I wish they include the gel how to use instructions.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work  Don&#x27;t waste money</li>
    <li> It works great! Makes face feel tight. It looks great!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING and really works.  I have very purple bags under my eyes and I look ten years younger when they go away.  I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Not at all like the pictures shown, and the product doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I have very fine lines around my eyes and forward and this product did absolutely nothing.  Very upset customer.</li>
    <li> Was not as good as I saw it on previews.</li>
    <li> Do not like this product at all....makes your skin under your eyes dry and feels rough gave me more wrinkles I would not recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> Will buy again worked great</li>
    <li> Perfect this product works great!</li>
    <li> Works great just like it says!</li>
    <li> 2 minutes after patting this product under my eyes, the bags are gone!  AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Extremely drying.  It felt like glue.  Packaging featured in listing was not what I received.  I did not receive the blister pack as pictured, but rather a small foil envelope containing the product.  I would not recommend this product for any reason.  A bottle of Elmer&#x27;s glue is more cost effective.</li>
    <li> Save your money. What a ripoff</li>
    <li> I do not like the residue thats left on your face. It does do a great job reducing the bags, just looks like you never washed your face when you woke up!</li>
    <li> This product was NOT the miracle it claimed to be, much too expensive, Sudden Beauty make close to the same thing and its much less expensive. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing bought them for my wife and it didn&#x27;t help the under eye puffiness like it said it would. She used it for a week straight. Not the results she was looking for.</li>
    <li> I love it! it works! My friends and family notice the difference when I wear it/ You just need to use moisturizers and make up with no oil base. I do want to say one thing here, This product is not supposed to be sold on Amazon. It is sold through Jeunesse Global Independent Distributors. That being said why buy this product at these prices when you can sign up and purchase them wholesale! If anyone wants to do that they should google Jeunesse Global and find a Distributor. You can get a lot more for your money than buying it here.</li>
    <li> Works just like they claim and the service was remarkable!</li>
    <li> Worked okay, but with this type of packaging you end up wasting a lot of the cream.</li>
    <li> Received promptly and they work like expected.</li>
    <li> This does work but doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.  Creates a tightness on the applied area.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me at all. I am glad I started with the small 5pk instead. It was dry and became sandy on my fingers before I can even put in on!</li>
    <li> I really like this product it really helps</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I figured I could afford to lose $20. so that&#x27;s why I chose to purchase only five little tubes.  It does get rid of the &amp;#34;puffy bags&amp;#34; under your eyes in the time it takes for the product to dry but within half an hour it starts to look powdery and flakey....not a good look with a summer tan or even &amp;#34;winter white&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I will continental to buy this product. After learning how to apply correctly it takes off about 10 years. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This product really worked. I put it on my bags and they disappead. I just put it on. I am waiting to see how long it will last. So far it is amazing.</li>
    <li> Great product, great delivery and great packaging. Love it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Even after 3 treatments I didn&#x27;t see a difference in bags under my eyes. Maybe after awhile it will start working?</li>
    <li> Really works instantly!! Going to order more!! Took years off my face! Applied under my eyes and instantly my puffiness &amp; bags were gone!</li>
    <li> Wish I could say I liked it but it didn&#x27;t do anything</li>
    <li> Did not do what the product was supposed to do.  If I put it before or after makeup application, the product caked and had to be washed off.</li>
    <li> Product does  not work...it leaves a thin film on the skin and seems to make it look more wrinkled.</li>
    <li> This product does make the under eye bag disappear but the return within minutes not 8 hrs.  I maybe doing something wrong but it came with no instructions.  I just followed the video I found online.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Instantly&amp;#34; is the perfect word to describe the results of this product. I will admit that I was quite skeptical the first few times I heard about and saw this product, but after hesitantly purchasing a small amount to try it out for myself, I cannot express enough how amazed and pleasantly surprised I still am to know that my skepticism was completely unwarranted. This is a miracle product, and you can quite literally see it working in real time a few seconds after application. I&#x27;m so glad this product exists and I will be purchasing Instantly Ageless for years to come.</li>
    <li> I bought 5 sample vials of this product to see if it really worked before I spent &amp;#34;big bucks&amp;#34;.  My initial reaction was WOW, and I still feel that way!!  I read many reviews on this before purchasing, and the one thing people did not like was the tight feeling or the white residue it left.  Yes, it does leave your face feeling very tight, but isn&#x27;t that the idea!  Also I found if you use too much in one spot, you will end up with the white residue.  Once you apply your moisturizer that tight feeling disappears and your face looks and feels great the rest of the day.  I will probably spend &amp;#34;big bucks&amp;#34; now to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> The item was not as in video. Instead of being a creamy white in color it was a very firm dark orange and hart to squeeze out of tube. was just small amount in tube . Not near as much as shown on finger in video. Wasted my money. will never buy again</li>
    <li> Left a film on skin, and I think it made my wrinkles more obvious. It was very dry, so had to wash off. Tried it several times and it never got better.</li>
    <li> This product works but is tricky. You must moisturize first and let dry. Take small amount and warm up between fingers to make it creamier. Pat don&#x27;t rub in.  Don&#x27;t dry with hair dryer!  Use a hand fan even a book to dry for 2 minutes.  Gently wipe off white residue with baby wipe. Sounds like a lot but if you don&#x27;t want dark circles that&#x27;s what it takes.</li>
    <li> Received the product not even in the box.  I was so excited to try this and when I went to squeeze the little tube it came out so thick like play doh.  At first did not think nothing of it.  When I went to put on my circles and tried to rub it in the cream rolled into a ball.  I could feel a slight tightness but on a scale of a change 1 being the worst and 10 being the best.  I would say a 2 and that is only because I think if it was not old and dried out it might of worked.  I still want to try but am leary.  Sent letter to seller and will wait for a response.  Sad 😔</li>
    <li> it does tighten your skin around your eyes but its feel like paste ,  its very dry and you can tell there is something on your skin and if you wash it off the effect goes away , i don&#x27;t wear make up so i cant tell you how it looks under make up sorry , if your looking for a quick right now effect of tight skin this is it</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I did not see any difference in my skin after using this product.</li>
    <li> Received sachets instead of the vials, (with a letter explaining 2 sachets equals 1 vial) this was a disappointed as I ordered THIS item over others specifically for the vials that I could recap after use...As for success with actual product; I did see some results (nothing dramatic)...I tried it a couple different times and some times there would be a white residue left behind, which from other readings that could mean is applied too much, however when I didn&#x27;t apply enough I didn&#x27;t see any results...Also the main thing I did not like was when I would later smile for a pic, there were a TON more visible fine lines due to the part of my skin with the cream crinkling up, that I just prefer to wear makeup over this.</li>
    <li> Very,very flaky and does not work at all</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how you put it on, it dries white and does not do well with any type of foundation.</li>
    <li> Received sample packets not viles as  advertised! Isnt it  illegal to sell sample packets ?? I want a refund!</li>
    <li> It would have been really nice to have received some sort of instructions with this product.</li>
    <li> They were not vials and each little whatever they are called was hardly enough for 1 application.</li>
    <li> love the effect on my eyes</li>
    <li> The product was gritty and did not perform like the video I saw online.  It does tighten the skin, but not enough to really see a difference.</li>
    <li> It was great! It arrived quickly and all vials were brand new unopened condition.  I still have the last tiniest bit left.  Will order the whole box next time!</li>
    <li> Not happy with this product, the cost is too expensive for the amount of product received.</li>
    <li> Got it very quick great stuff thanks</li>
    <li> I would not advise anyone to purchase this product.  Mine did not come packaged as described or shown.  I wouldn&#x27;t have minded the packaging if the product actually worked.  Even a little bit.  I saw no change in appearance.</li>
    <li> Does not work.don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Would NOT recommend this product didn&#x27;t work at all like the commercials</li>
    <li> Product works as stated. Dry s skin and not t long lived but good. However sender sent samples not vials. Not as described</li>
    <li> I love it. I dont need much, I mostley need it for my neck but you can feel it tighten and a little does go along way. For people who say it is hard to cover up you cant use an oil base product. Also a thin layer is all you need, for me it last about 7 hours and though it was subtle my husband notice a diference as my eyes didnt look as tired as they do normally. I wish this was a product that came in a bottle instead of these little packets.</li>
    <li> I bought this for 23.00 and change and only received 3 vials !!! yes it works really well but I should get what I paid for , maybe it&#x27;s 3 for me and 2 for who ever packs it !!</li>
    <li> Far to small and I have a small frame!</li>
    <li> Works for about an hour and when dry it leaves a white film.</li>
    <li> saw instant results as represented, could feel and see tightening of skin, wrinkles but within an hour of facial movement, talking, all fell back, very disappointing.  glad i did not buy the $70 order, only the five pack for $22+</li>
    <li> Jeunesse Instant Ageless is definitely not botox, so don’t set your hopes too high. It did soften my wrinkles a bit though and made my skin more hydrated. I just bought Skingenixx moisturizer [[ASIN:B00VSCKY1E Skingenixx Hyaluronic Acid Facial Moisturizer.]], and I absolutely love it – it makes my skin smooth, soft and supple and has even made my wrinkles less visible! Great products, I love them.</li>
