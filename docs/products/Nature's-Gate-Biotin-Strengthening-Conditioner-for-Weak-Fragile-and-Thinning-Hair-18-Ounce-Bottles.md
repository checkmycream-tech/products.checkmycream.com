### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
      <li>I do use non-natural hair care products as well, but these have been working the best.</li>
      <li>I have witnessed this product produce great results!</li>
      <li>No dandruff, my hair is thicker, my hair has grown a great deal!</li>
      <li>This, coupled with the Pomegranate Sunflower shampoo makes my hair very happy, and they both smell great too!</li>
      <li>Gate has very good products and quality ingredients.</li>
      <li>But, it still isn&#x27;t very good.  </li>
      <li>Not to mention that it works great too</li>
      <li>and I needed a good handful of this to even make a dent</li>
      <li>Nice product.  </li>
      <li>It is also infused with hair healthy vitamins.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this and the feel.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I think as we most hair care products, how well it matches your hair matches</li>
      <li>i love mint</li>
      <li>Great price, love the smell, and my hair is very soft!</li>
      <li>When I was using it several years ago, I got good results, but not this good.</li>
      <li>It makes a huge difference in added body and volume and leaves my hair smooth.</li>
      <li>Sulfate free is the way to go.</li>
      <li>It is a gentle cleaner that is perfect for oily scalps, but doesn&#x27;t strip it or dry it out.</li>
      <li>I was so excited when I got this product.</li>
      <li>My hair is so soft and is much more manageable now!</li>
      <li>Although this has a rather thick consistency, once you apply it to your hair, you have a very refreshing mint scent and a coolness to your scalp that is extremely pleasant.</li>
      <li>Makes my scalp cool and tingly.</li>
      <li>Right now, this conditioner does the best for adding volume to my fine, middle-aged, thin, blow-dried, color treated hair.  </li>
      <li>In the shower, my hair is very smooth and nice but upon drying it is stiff.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, for the relief my scalp has had, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>However, this product is more like a protein treatment, and while the product DOES do what it says which is strengthen, naturally your hair will stiffen as it&#x27;s fortified.  </li>
      <li>works great makes my hair thick and shiny using both conditioner and shampoo.</li>
      <li>it really works wonders!</li>
      <li>Firstly, it depends on what you want to do with this product.  </li>
      <li>it is a good conditioner left my hair really soft my hair has really improved after using it .</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I really like the fact this does not contain sulfate, which damages your hair follicles.</li>
      <li>I took off one star because I normally have very curly hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this shampoo off and on for about 17 years - since I was in high school</li>
      <li>I recently had my hair dyed purple using pure pigment color, and needed to switch to sulfate-free shampoo.</li>
      <li>other things that help my hair tremendously are putting coconut oil in it overnight and a drop of argan oil before blow drying.</li>
      <li>Nature&#x27;s Gate might lead you to believe it is an all natural product.</li>
      <li>For those of us who are chemically sensitive and even those of us who aren&#x27;t this is not helpful when dealing with thinning or weakening hair.</li>
      <li>My scalp was dry and this has really helped.</li>
      <li>Due to health issues I have lost a substantial amount of hair and it is very discouraging!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The conditioner does not contain \\&quot;Sodium Laureth Sulfate\\&quot; as was stated by another reviewer (that&#x27;s probably the shampoo).  But, it still isn&#x27;t very good.  I have shoulder length hair that soaks up conditioner and I needed a good handful of this to even make a dent and then I needed another handful when that just disappeared like water into my hair. And I followed that up with a leave-in conditioner.  I gave it to my husband who has really short hair and he didn&#x27;t like it either.  He said, \\&quot;It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s extremely water soluable\\&quot;.  Returning this for store credit at WF.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this off amazon but at a store for 3.64. I&#x27;m returning it. My experience is this didnt do a thing for my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Makes my scalp cool and tingly. I really like the fact this does not contain sulfate, which damages your hair follicles. It is also infused with hair healthy vitamins. Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I recently came across this product looking for something to help with my thinning/weakening hair! Due to health issues I have lost a substantial amount of hair and it is very discouraging! I was so excited when I got this product. Unfortunately when I looked at the ingredients list \\&quot;Sodium Laureth Sulfate\\&quot; was the second ingredient listed! The name of this product is deceiving calling itself Nature&#x27;s Gate might lead you to believe it is an all natural product. Anyone who has done any research knows that Sodium Laureth Sulfate is a chemical agent that is NOT good for you. For those of us who are chemically sensitive and even those of us who aren&#x27;t this is not helpful when dealing with thinning or weakening hair. Sodium Laureth Sulfate has actually been proven to CAUSE hair thinning! Just another company trying to exploit on the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; thing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo off and on for about 17 years - since I was in high school (I&#x27;m 33 now!).  It is a gentle cleaner that is perfect for oily scalps, but doesn&#x27;t strip it or dry it out. It also helps keep your hair nourished if you are someone who has dyed it or lives in a dry climate.   It is a terrific buy - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> works great makes my hair thick and shiny using both conditioner and shampoo. slowed down the hair loss and no sulfates</li>
    <li> i love mint so i would purchase this for just the smell alone. Not to mention that it works great too</li>
    <li> Right now, this conditioner does the best for adding volume to my fine, middle-aged, thin, blow-dried, color treated hair.  It makes a huge difference in added body and volume and leaves my hair smooth. When I was using it several years ago, I got good results, but not this good. I think as we most hair care products, how well it matches your hair matches the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other things that help my hair tremendously are putting coconut oil in it overnight and a drop of argan oil before blow drying. I do use non-natural hair care products as well, but these have been working the best. Oh, plus Phomollient from Aveda for styling.</li>
    <li> I will be buying this product again it is a good conditioner left my hair really soft my hair has really improved after using it .</li>
    <li> Great price, love the smell, and my hair is very soft! Helps with damaged hair</li>
    <li> I have witnessed this product produce great results! I would not stop using it for anything. This the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used! No dandruff, my hair is thicker, my hair has grown a great deal! I am an Afro American woman...it really works wonders!</li>
    <li> Firstly, it depends on what you want to do with this product.  In the shower, my hair is very smooth and nice but upon drying it is stiff.  Therefore, I use this conditioner as a shampoo every so often for my damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nature&#x27;s Gate has very good products and quality ingredients. However, this product is more like a protein treatment, and while the product DOES do what it says which is strengthen, naturally your hair will stiffen as it&#x27;s fortified.  I don&#x27;t suggest  using every day, but treating this conditioner as a weekly protein treatment, following up with moisture because your hair needs BOTH to be strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not bad for the price, there are plenty of high end hair products that do the exact same thing eg Redken&#x27;s  extreme CAT</li>
    <li> I recently had my hair dyed purple using pure pigment color, and needed to switch to sulfate-free shampoo. The first wash or 2 was weird, because my hair was adjusting from using Pantene for 15 years to this completely new hair philosophy, and I will never go back. Sulfate free is the way to go. This, coupled with the Pomegranate Sunflower shampoo makes my hair very happy, and they both smell great too!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this and the feel. My scalp was dry and this has really helped. I took off one star because I normally have very curly hair and this straightens me out a bit and I wish it didn&#x27;t. Otherwise, for the relief my scalp has had, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I have such thin and straight hair, this product I purchased due to being alergic to &amp;#34;Sulfa&amp;#34; and even though conditioners do not normally have alot (if any) that in it, this one specified it didn&#x27;t have any.  So I use this regularly and cannot be happier!  My hair is so soft and is much more manageable now!</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Fast shipping. Would order again</li>
    <li> Although this has a rather thick consistency, once you apply it to your hair, you have a very refreshing mint scent and a coolness to your scalp that is extremely pleasant. would not trade this for another conditioner.</li>
