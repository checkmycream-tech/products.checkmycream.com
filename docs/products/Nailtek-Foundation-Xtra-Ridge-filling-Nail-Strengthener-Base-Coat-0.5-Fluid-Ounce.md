      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>This leveled the damage after a good buffing and cleaning.  </li>
      <li>love nailtek products--this is great for my beat up nails.</li>
      <li>Also makes for a good nail polish remover if you happen to be out of your own remover.</li>
      <li>I liked it so much (its a great product!)</li>
      <li>The final pedicure looked excellent.</li>
      <li>It is, indeed, a pretty good ridge filler.</li>

      <li>Makes a smooth surface for nail polish or mani.</li>
      <li>I have to order more and will be doing so very soon.</li>
      <li>Did a really good job filling a pretty deep &amp;#34;ditch&amp;#34; from a minor injury -- I will be able to keep it nicely disguised until it finishes growing out.</li>
      <li>Put it on clean dry nails then add your own colored or non colored polish.  </li>
      <li>In the photo, the item to the right is what I received the first time.  </li>
      <li>First time I ordered I got what is in the picture.  </li>
      <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed</li>
      <li>I hope it continues to be as good as it has been these past 5 days.</li>
      <li>Nailtek makes them strong and they actually grow!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really fill in ridges on my nails.</li>
      <li>My nails are much stronger and no ridges</li>
      <li>This really works wonders for me.  </li>
      <li>I was unable to find it in stores and was so pleased that it was available on Amazon!  </li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product based on the reviews, and it did not disappoint.</li>
      <li>Apparently the seller got it right only once......</li>
      <li>It dries quickly, so you can do multiple coats in a short time.  </li>
      <li>My nail polish last much longer because of it</li>
      <li>I have not had this long, and this is my first use of it.</li>
      <li>Excellent base coat.</li>
      <li>nails are not showing the deep ridges that come with age, and my nails are not weak feeling with it</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will take off the old and put on a new coating of it tomorrow or the next day.</li>
      <li>This formula is white in the bottle but dries almost clear.</li>
      <li>This works very well, and provides a good base for polish.  </li>

<li> This works very well, and provides a good base for polish.  </li>
<li> Due to a period of heightened stress in my life, my thumb nails were an awful mess, with many, many deep ridges.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a good base coat too.</li>
<li> I put a coat on, let it dry and then buff.  </li>
<li> What arrived was a ripped up dirty, old, grimy, ancient package design that didn&#x27;t even look remotely like the picture of the product on the amazon website and didn&#x27;t look anything remotely like what I received the first time.  </li>
<li> Great product, terrible seller.  </li>
<li> than the other time.  </li>
<li> Has a slight sheen.  </li>
<li> I may have to do it a few times, but it comes off so I can freshen it up once again.  </li>
<li> Not sure I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
<li> The 2 items to the right are what I received (incorrect item in a filthy ripped package)</li>
<li> This hides my thick ridges and protects my nails from breaking, so they get longer when i use this.  </li>
<li> My nails are ordinarily thin and weak.  </li>
<li> I have a terrible habit of picking my thumb nail cuticles--damaging the nail bed and causing deep ridges in the resulting finger nails that grow in after the damage.</li>

    <li> Great product.  It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed and, these days, that&#x27;s quite a compliment!</li>
    <li> This works very well, and provides a good base for polish.  It dries quickly, so you can do multiple coats in a short time.

    <li> Excellent base coat. My nail polish last much longer because of it</li>
    <li> This product works well.</li>
    <li> I have not had this long, and this is my first use of it. I put it on 5 days ago, and then polish over it and no chips nor anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails are not showing the deep ridges that come with age, and my nails are not weak feeling with it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will take off the old and put on a new coating of it tomorrow or the next day. I hope it continues to be as good as it has been these past 5 days.</li>
    <li> This is NOT a stand alone product.  Put it on clean dry nails then add your own colored or non colored polish.  My nails are much stronger and no ridges</li>
    <li> Leaves nails strong like it says. Makes a smooth surface for nail polish or mani. Also makes for a good nail polish remover if you happen to be out of your own remover. Do have to apply again though.</li>

    <li> This stuff works great.</li>
    <li> First time I ordered I got what is in the picture.  I liked it so much (its a great product!) that I immediately ordered it again as a gift for someone.  What arrived was a ripped up dirty, old, grimy, ancient package design that didn&#x27;t even look remotely like the picture of the product on the amazon website and didn&#x27;t look anything remotely like what I received the first time.  Undeterred, I ordered it yet again, and this time the package was even more beat up and old and dirty etc. than the other time.  Apparently the seller got it right only once...... Great product, terrible seller.  In the photo, the item to the right is what I received the first time.  The 2 items to the right are what I received (incorrect item in a filthy ripped package)</li>
    <li> love nailtek products--this is great for my beat up nails.</li>
    <li> Toes had taken a beating moving into a four story walk up.  This leveled the damage after a good buffing and cleaning.  The final pedicure looked excellent.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really fill in ridges on my nails. Not sure I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
    <li> This hides my thick ridges and protects my nails from breaking, so they get longer when i use this.  Has a slight sheen.  It&#x27;s a good base coat too.</li>
    <li> This is the best for the severe vertical lines in some of my nails.  If I don&#x27;t use this the ridges created by the lines in my nails keep pealing and catch on things all the time.  I&#x27;m allergic to regular nail polish and the remover, so I can&#x27;t use that to solve the ridges  problem.  This really works wonders for me.  When I have to remove it to freshen it up, I just put it on the nail and wipe it off immediately.  I may have to do it a few times, but it comes off so I can freshen it up once again.  I like that it&#x27;s not shiny so it look the same when finished as the rest of the nails.  I have to order more and will be doing so very soon.</li>
