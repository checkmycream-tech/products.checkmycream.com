<li> Back to my review though, my hair is very soft and moisturized and yet it is not weighed down.</li>
<li> My daughter is natural and due to wearing natural styles, her ends became very dry and brittle!!</li>
<li> If your hair I damaged, dry, brittle and/or needs constant moisture</li>
<li> I finally found the product I&#x27;ve spent years looking for.  </li>
<li> This conditioner rinses easily and doesnt leave a greasy heavy residue behind.</li>
<li> but I am concerned that it does not smell the same as my other conditioner.</li>
<li> Dry hair with no gloss?  </li>
<li> and now I will air dry my hair anywhere between 85% &amp; 95% and then finish off the drying process with my hair dryer.</li>
<li> so my hair can get a little dry and frizzy, but when I used this conditioner I instantly saw results.</li>
<li> The Moisturfusion Silk Cream is a very thick consistency and it felt very moisturizing going on immediately after I rinsed the MF Milk Bath from my hair.</li>
<li> I highly recommend to those that may be skeptical.  </li>
<li> I have hair that becomes oily if not washed everyday, yet it also becomes dry and dull.  </li>
<li> I hate the scent so much</li>
<li> I really believe that you won&#x27;t be disappointed!  </li>
<li> I HATE the smell!</li>

    <li> Great product and seller, My girlfriend and I enjoy the product and perfect service !</li>
    <li> I finally found the product I&#x27;ve spent years looking for.  After so many years of coloring my hair, I was looking for a product that restores the softness to my dried-out hair.  This, combined with the Milk Bath (shampoo) has been perfect.</li>
    <li> Well I am out from under my Tyche Pro Conditioning Heat Cap and I have already rinsed my hair and I have applied my leave in of choice and now I will air dry my hair anywhere between 85% &amp; 95% and then finish off the drying process with my hair dryer. This is something I always try to do to keep my hair from being excessively dry and brittle from the too frequent use of heated styling appliances. Back to my review though, my hair is very soft and moisturized and yet it is not weighed down. The Moisturfusion Silk Cream is a very thick consistency and it felt very moisturizing going on immediately after I rinsed the MF Milk Bath from my hair. This conditioner rinses easily and doesnt leave a greasy heavy residue behind. The entire Moistufusion System will be used heavily by me this winter to keep my tresses in top shape.</li>
    <li> It was great but I am concerned that it does not smell the same as my other conditioner.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling silky but no greasy also has a nice scent to it</li>
    <li> this product breathes life into my hair really would purchase over and over the item arrived packaged nicely too!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great and helpful if your hair got damaged as mine did recently.</li>
    <li> While I think this conditioner is good for hair I HATE the smell! The scent is off-putting while it&#x27;s on my hair and even after it&#x27;s rinsed. It&#x27;s been more than a week since I used that conditioner and when I sweat I can STILL smell it in my hair. I hate the scent so much I quite literally threw away an almost full 33.8 oz bottle. If Mizani can make this product smell better I would use it once again.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel so soft. I love this product and will recommend. I will be buying more and the price is great too.</li>
    <li> Works ok bit the smell is aweful.</li>
    <li> I have hair that becomes oily if not washed everyday, yet it also becomes dry and dull.  This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used.  It makes my hair soft, shiny, and fuller.</li>
    <li> My daughter is natural and due to wearing natural styles, her ends became very dry and brittle!! This product here was the only to help repair those ends!! I would let this product sit on het hair for 30min!! Shipping was fast as well!!</li>
    <li> I love it! No matter what I try to condition my natural hair I always come back to this product. If your hair I damaged, dry, brittle and/or needs constant moisture this is the product for you. This product works well on all types of hair.</li>
    <li> My twin daughters are mixed kids (I am white and their father is African) and they have tight ringlets but still pretty coarse in the back of their head.  I have ordered just about every conditioner from Mizani to make sure I could find them the best for their hair and the Moisturfusion Silk Cream Conditioner is definitely their match.  It leaves their hair so soft!  They only wash their hair once each week but they use the conditioner every time they take a shower.  We love it!</li>
    <li> This is a really good conditioner! I have naturally curly hair so my hair can get a little dry and frizzy, but when I used this conditioner I instantly saw results. My curls were bouncy and full of life and best of all not frizzy. I went to work the next day and someone at work commented on my hair looking different and all I did differently was use this conditioner.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at a local retailer on accident!  I decided to try this product after I freshly shampooed my hair first.  This is excellent for those who may have dry, brittle hair.  I sat underneath a warm hooded dryer for about 20 minutes and it makes your hair very silky!  My hair has really improved after continued use of this product.  I highly recommend to those that may be skeptical.  If so try a smaller bottle of this and see if it works for you.  If it does, continue to use for the future.  I really believe that you won&#x27;t be disappointed!  Great product will order again!!  Also, I used it on my mother&#x27;s hair it made it gorgeous afterwards!</li>
    <li> Good price! Thanks Amazon.com</li>
    <li> This product is a great product, especially for naturalista&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Dry hair with no gloss?  Mizani is great -- especially for aging hair and curly-heads.  Better than any other product out there for moisturizing.</li>
