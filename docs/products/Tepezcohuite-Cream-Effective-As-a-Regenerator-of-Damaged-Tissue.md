    <li> Not for my faces maybe  for the body but smells good.</li>
    <li> First off I will say that I was disappointed in the fact it contains mineral oil and parabens. I bought this because I thought it was all natural. Regardless. IT WORKS. I&#x27;m using it for better overall facial appearance. It tones an tightens. Not greasy and absorbs instantly. My pores disappear, my skin is radiant and smooth. I also bought one for my teenage daughter who struggles with acne and dryness. Her transformation has been amazing. After one week of using this cream it made a huge difference. Now her face is smooth, and all of her redness and acne scares are gone. This has all happened in the course of just over 2 weeks.  Seller was very quick to ship. Will buy from again!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this trying to save money instead of buying the one I normaly purchase. The ingredients were not natural and it contained mineral oil.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it anyway and have expeireinced multiple breakouts, I will be ordering my old standby ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand I am a firm believer in the Tepezcohuite herb for healing the skin, just make sure you check the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Excellent regenerator for your skin, when I get out of the shower I love the way it makes my skin feel and look.</li>
    <li> I have been using it about a week or so and I thought this was going to be a product to correct some skin issues that I had from scarring. So far it hasn&#x27;t done that....too bad I was really hoping it was going to be the answer.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My face feels so smooth.  It smells good too.  I will continue to buy it.  This is my second jar.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> very good cream, I will buying more</li>
    <li> Nice texture and aroma, I am using on my neck and d&amp;eacute;colletage !</li>
    <li> this stuff is ridiculously amazing - truly</li>

    <li> ...very nice cream and d saw a slight change after 2 weeks of use.  It is a good product I will always use for the tops of my elderly hands.  Smells very nice and is skin toned colored.  I wish it came in a larger jar for my body.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know about the regeneration part but it took away most of my breakouts! I have adult acne and at 52 I can&#x27;t say enough how embarrassing it is so I used this product after hearing positive reviews and gotta say, love it! My face is so clear now. I will continue buying and using this product!</li>
    <li> Awesome cream, feels good right away.</li>
    <li> Great stuff ! Very effective on a leg wound.</li>
    <li> It was recommended to me for stretch marks but I am so surprise it has not only stared fading my ugly looking red stretch marks but also it has faded Olmost completely a bad looking surgery scar i&lt;br /&gt;had.  I am very happy. Oh and I been using it on my face and has also started fading my black skin spots off my cheeks. 👍</li>
