      <li>I love it ..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad it gave it a try.  </li>
      <li>My favorite for a light coverage foundation powder!</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and stays on nicely all day.</li>
      <li>After using this a couple more times I&#x27;ve noticed it does accentuate the wrinkles around my eyes</li>
      <li>Love this powder.</li>
      <li>the coverage- does not settle into wrinkles and it feels light and clean!!</li>
      <li>The creamy natural is my perfect shade that matches my skin tone- the lighter colors (even when they are &amp;#34;translucent&amp;#34;)</li>
      <li>it is a good size, and it is a REAL mirror.</li>
      <li>This was my original review- Love</li>
      <li>The price is fabulous and the quality is as good as anything I&#x27;ve tried, including high end products.</li>
      <li>The powder that is not powdery, I&#x27;ve tried so many compacts, but this one never fails me, it does what its supposed to do and never gets cakey doesn&#x27;t sink into fine lines and wrinkles, been purchasing this product for years while I try other brands, I always seem to come back to this one for a good reason, it works great!</li>
      <li>I do prefer Cover Girls Clean Powder to this and won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
      <li>Nothing special about product except the price.</li>
      <li>It is fresh and clean with a light amount of coverage.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty loose powder but looks great.</li>
      <li>Good mineral powder that goes on smoothly and matches my complexion color better than most, even far more expensive brands.</li>
      <li>Smooth appearance not heavy, light weight.</li>
      <li>But worth it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t spread well even with a brush and gets pretty cakey.</li>
      <li>I have used many brands of makeup including the big names that cost a fortune.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>so I really like how I can put it on in the afternoon and take away the shine on my face.</li>
      <li>I guess you really do just get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use this when I get ready at home.</li>
      <li>It was everything I had hoped for and more than I expected.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep buying it, especially when I can find great deals on Amazon like &amp;#34;buy two, get one free&amp;#34; for stocking up as when I bought this past time.</li>
      <li>it covers really well, and it was the right color, but i may need to get the next one, one shade darker because here comes summer soon.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and have never had any issues with this powder.</li>
      <li>But I need a little darker shade as this shade is lighter than the Cover Girl Clean Pressed Powder in Classic Beige.  </li>
      <li>Works fine, doesn&#x27;t clump up or unevenly spread on the face.</li>
      <li>my face looks so natural</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like but is cheap enough for me to buy often if I need to frequently apply it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 48, and although my skin is not as oily as it once was (and has even become dry in places), this powder kills the shine and is very pretty/effective.  </li>
      <li>Much lighter than expected.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The only foundation powder that actually works to cover my skin. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like but is cheap enough for me to buy often if I need to frequently apply it.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for using it as a touch up product.  I don&#x27;t use this when I get ready at home. However,  if I am out and about,  and need a touch up, this does the trick. Blends perfectly,  rids your face of shine, and smells fabulous!  I like the mirror,  it is a good size, and it is a REAL mirror. The sponge is great to and cleans nicely.</li>
    <li> I love it .. my face looks so natural</li>
    <li> This powder was very chalky and dry not good coverage at all.very bad product,dont buy</li>
    <li> Have used it for years - a no brainer!</li>
    <li> I use this product as a finishing powder and carry one in my purse for touch-ups.  The price is fabulous and the quality is as good as anything I&#x27;ve tried, including high end products.</li>
    <li> The powder that is not powdery, I&#x27;ve tried so many compacts, but this one never fails me, it does what its supposed to do and never gets cakey doesn&#x27;t sink into fine lines and wrinkles, been purchasing this product for years while I try other brands, I always seem to come back to this one for a good reason, it works great!</li>
    <li> The creamy natural is my perfect shade that matches my skin tone- the lighter colors (even when they are &amp;#34;translucent&amp;#34;) give me a &amp;#34;white out&amp;#34; fake/ridiculous look. I&#x27;ve always used CoverGirl pressed powders, and the Advanced Radiance is very nice. I typically apply it a couple of times a day at work to knock out the shine on my nose and forehead. I&#x27;m 48, and although my skin is not as oily as it once was (and has even become dry in places), this powder kills the shine and is very pretty/effective.  I&#x27;ll keep buying it, especially when I can find great deals on Amazon like &amp;#34;buy two, get one free&amp;#34; for stocking up as when I bought this past time. When the powder puff becomes too used and gross, I also have extra puffs on hand (also bought on Amazon) so that I can continue to use the powder and not have skin issues/breakouts.  Highly recommended! And I love the newer look of the these compacts- nice!</li>
    <li> I have used many brands of makeup including the big names that cost a fortune.  This is as good as any and better than most. I&#x27;m liking a lot of CoverGirl&#x27;s formulas lately. This is the best powder out of the bunch.  It is fresh and clean with a light amount of coverage.  I use it as a finish to the liquid foundation. The price is a big bonus. too.</li>
    <li> Smooth appearance not heavy, light weight.</li>
    <li> it covers really well, and it was the right color, but i may need to get the next one, one shade darker because here comes summer soon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nothing great....I think I prefer the silky Revlon products much better...  just so so for me....would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I should start by saying that I usually buy pretty pricey makeup, so maybe my view is skewed. I figured I&#x27;d give this a shot based on the reviews and I&#x27;m not terribly impressed. It doesn&#x27;t spread well even with a brush and gets pretty cakey. I guess you really do just get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin so I really like how I can put it on in the afternoon and take away the shine on my face.</li>
    <li> This has god coverage; I don&#x27;t even need to wear foundation.</li>
    <li> Works fine, doesn&#x27;t clump up or unevenly spread on the face. Good product!</li>
    <li> This was my original review- Love the coverage- does not settle into wrinkles and it feels light and clean!! But I need a little darker shade as this shade is lighter than the Cover Girl Clean Pressed Powder in Classic Beige.  UPDATE- After using this a couple more times I&#x27;ve noticed it does accentuate the wrinkles around my eyes so I&#x27;m giving this a lower score. It&#x27;s too powdery if that makes sense. I do prefer Cover Girls Clean Powder to this and won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> If you are over 40, this is the best powder you can buy.  It goes on smoothly and stays on nicely all day.</li>
    <li> It goes on easy &amp; looks great.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> My favorite for a light coverage foundation powder!</li>
    <li> Great coverage and awesome color without looking flaky or pastey.  I&#x27;m so glad it gave it a try.  Also give great coverage throughout the day.</li>
    <li> i like it. great product</li>
    <li> Nothing special about product except the price.</li>
    <li> Much lighter than expected. I get this same shade by Loreal, so I expected the Cover Girl to be closer in tone than it is.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! In my forties and was looking for powder that won&#x27;t cake up or sit in wrinkles. Feels like silk and stays on well.</li>
    <li> Good mineral powder that goes on smoothly and matches my complexion color better than most, even far more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using cover girl for years- love it!</li>
    <li> I definitely would recommend this product and the quality of the item.  It was everything I had hoped for and more than I expected.  Very happy with the product and the purchase through Amazon.  A win-win purchase.</li>
    <li> Was the wrong make up compact</li>
    <li> Love this powder. Doesn&#x27;t last very long though. But worth it. It&#x27;s a pretty loose powder but looks great.</li>
    <li> Love it! The color is perfect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this powder for years!! I have very oily skin, this keeps the oil way down!! I love how it gives me that perfect matte finish. It doesn&#x27;t not make me break out. I have very sensitive skin, and have never had any issues with this powder.</li>
