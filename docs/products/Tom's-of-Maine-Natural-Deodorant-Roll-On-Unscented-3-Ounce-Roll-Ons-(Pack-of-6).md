### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a win win.</li>
      <li>Smells great.  </li>
      <li>Stops stinky naturally, good price</li>
      <li>Sent to UK from USA but arrived surprisingly promptly.</li>
      <li>This works fairly well, but sometimes discolors my underarms.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just glad I can still find it online!  </li>
      <li>so I was happy to find this still available.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product that really works.</li>
      <li>still provides effective deodorant protection.</li>
      <li>What more is a deodorant supposed to do?</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything better though.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m allergic to most types of deodorants</li>
      <li>what more do you need.</li>
      <li>Hands down the best deodorant I have found.  </li>
      <li>Tackles damp and odor in a guy that would otherwise not be fit for company.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect deodorant I looked for my whole life and finally found.  </li>
      <li>can&#x27;t get good results on a regular basis and now my pits are becoming irritated within minutes of rolling some on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m allergic to most deodorants and most &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants</li>
      <li>This product addresses that issue and is very effective without the waxy feeling of other products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve researched for hours and investigated all the stores and not come up with anything good that prevents smell and makes you feel truly dry without stains on your clothes.</li>
      <li>While the results of various studies haven&#x27;t really confirmed or disproven a lot of the fears or concerns regarding aluminum based deodorants I feel better using this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And most importantly, it will last you all day.</li>
      <li>Not natural like Tom&#x27;s, but it works for more than 4 hours and doesn&#x27;t irritate me.</li>
      <li>This \\&quot;Unscented\\&quot; product does have a very slight lemongrass fragrance on application, but it&#x27;s minimal and very pleasant.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s performance is really inconsistent.</li>
      <li>or if it&#x27;s how finicky the deodorant can be with the amount of time it wants to dry.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My husband (and other members of our family) have been using Tom&#x27;s Unscented Roll-on Deodorant for many years.</li>
      <li>Their Roll-On lasts significantly longer than their stick, yet mysteriously the Roll-On has vanished from stores.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;While this roll-on doesn&#x27;t last a full 24 hours, I don&#x27;t really stink at the 20-24 hour mark.</li>
      <li>I tend to like the Tom&#x27;s of Main products for both of those reasons.  </li>
      <li>Most underarm products make my husband break out in a rash, and this is the only natural deodorant that he feels works well enough for him.</li>
      <li>I mainly used Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s Natural option for a while.</li>
      <li>If you have dry or very sensitive skin, apply body lotion first, then the Roll-On, and it won&#x27;t sting at all.  </li>
      <li>Completely kills odor; doesn&#x27;t irritate; doesn&#x27;t smell; doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.</li>
      <li>The kids are young enough where they still have fun running around naked before bath time anyway.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I switched to this because I developed an allergy to antiperspirant.  </li>
      <li>This one does works for me, and it&#x27;s fairly natural, as befits Tom&#x27;s brand.</li>
      <li>My wife has extremely sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I am not particulary sensitive, but I cannot use this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all natural and helps with odors.</li>
      <li>With so many products and companies  it should not be this hard to find something  as simple as something that doesn&#x27;t wreck your clothes or make smell like you haven&#x27;t washed in the last 24 hours.    </li>
      <li>and so far there&#x27;s been no staining on my white undershirts or dress</li>
      <li>I loved the old one. :-(</li>

    <li> I have a lot of allergies, so I have to choose my products carefully.  And I also want quality.  I tend to like the Tom&#x27;s of Main products for both of those reasons.  Their Roll-On lasts significantly longer than their stick, yet mysteriously the Roll-On has vanished from stores.  I&#x27;m just glad I can still find it online!  This \\&quot;Unscented\\&quot; product does have a very slight lemongrass fragrance on application, but it&#x27;s minimal and very pleasant.  If you have dry or very sensitive skin, apply body lotion first, then the Roll-On, and it won&#x27;t sting at all.  And most importantly, it will last you all day.</li>
    <li> Love this. I&#x27;m allergic to most deodorants and most &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants I&#x27;ve tried simply don&#x27;t work. Sent to UK from USA but arrived surprisingly promptly. Amazon always refund excess import duties too.</li>
    <li> My husband (and other members of our family) have been using Tom&#x27;s Unscented Roll-on Deodorant for many years. Most underarm products make my husband break out in a rash, and this is the only natural deodorant that he feels works well enough for him.</li>
    <li> I have been using Tom&#x27;s products for years and wanted to try the roll-on, unscented deodorant.  Although it worked really well, by the fourth application, I had this really bad burning sensation under both arms.  I am not particulary sensitive, but I cannot use this product.</li>
    <li> This is the same stuff as the deoderant except it&#x27;s a roll-on. I WISH THEY&#x27;D MAKE A ANTI-PERSPERANT!! This is the only stuff I know of that doesn&#x27;t stain/clump on my clothes and wreck them. I&#x27;ve tried different gels and whites. I&#x27;m dying for a anti-persperant by TOMS!! Everything else leaves white residue on the pits of my clothes. I&#x27;ve been having complaints about smelling bad and I realized it&#x27;s because this is only a deodorant and not an anti-persperant. I need an anti-persperant. Even other roll-ons leave white residue. I&#x27;m tired of wasting money trying different products. Tom&#x27;s is supposed to be the future. They need to do an anti-persperant. I don&#x27;t care if it contains aluminum or not!! Gives me something that prevents odor!! I&#x27;d even pay a few dollars extra. I&#x27;ve researched for hours and investigated all the stores and not come up with anything good that prevents smell and makes you feel truly dry without stains on your clothes. With so many products and companies  it should not be this hard to find something  as simple as something that doesn&#x27;t wreck your clothes or make smell like you haven&#x27;t washed in the last 24 hours.    Make an anti-persperant, TOMS!! Hurry.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for past 20 years without disappointment.  No fragrancence to compete with, dry underarms...what more do you need.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best deodorant I have found.  Works all day.  Smells great.  And you do not have to worry about all the chemicals in standard deodorant.  Thank you Toms of Maine!</li>
    <li> Completely kills odor; doesn&#x27;t irritate; doesn&#x27;t smell; doesn&#x27;t stain clothing. What more is a deodorant supposed to do? Everyone is different, so what works for one person might not work as well for another. This one does works for me, and it&#x27;s fairly natural, as befits Tom&#x27;s brand. I&#x27;m sticking with this.</li>
    <li> I switched to this because I developed an allergy to antiperspirant.  This works fairly well, but sometimes discolors my underarms.  I haven&#x27;t found anything better though.</li>
    <li> I switched to this product years ago when I found my shirts were getting stained from the aluminum in other deodorants.  This product addresses that issue and is very effective without the waxy feeling of other products.</li>
    <li> I used to get this all the time before the label change. For some reason, I am getting a bad reaction to this.  I get itchy with patches that start peeling, like from a sunburn. It&#x27;s too bad the formula changed...I loved the old one. :-(</li>
    <li> This is the perfect deodorant I looked for my whole life and finally found.  After carrying it for a few years, the stores I could get it in all stopped carrying it for some unknown reason (or maybe it was just Murphy&#x27;s Law).  Thank goodness you had it, and got it to me in very short order.  I hope you keep carrying it, as long as Tom&#x27;s keeps making it.</li>
    <li> Maybe this chemical blend just doesn&#x27;t work with my body. Burns my skin, roller ball catches my pit hairs and pulls them, and then I instantly stink upon application. This was supposed to be unscented, but I may as well have rubbed my underarms with a pair of gym shorts. Very disappointed. Worst \\&quot;natural\\&quot; one I&#x27;ve tried yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to most types of deodorants so I was happy to find this still available.</li>
    <li> My wife has extremely sensitive skin and this is the one deodorant that prevents her from breaking out yet still provides effective deodorant protection.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all natural and helps with odors. This is a wonderful product that really works. It goes on clear and no sticky mess on your shirt.</li>
    <li> This deodorant burned my underarm skin and caused massive peeling and flaking in addition to being very painful. I stopped using it immediately, 3 days ago, and I am still peeling. I can&#x27;t use this product and have never had a reaction like this to anything else. It also did nothing for odor. Shortly after applying it, there was B.O. There is something wrong with this one, and I normally love Tom&#x27;s of Maine products.</li>
    <li> Stops stinky naturally, good price</li>
    <li> ... because it gets the job done, without perfumes etc. Tackles damp and odor in a guy that would otherwise not be fit for company.</li>
    <li> I played around with a number of different deodorants. I mainly used Arm &amp; Hammer&#x27;s Natural option for a while. While the results of various studies haven&#x27;t really confirmed or disproven a lot of the fears or concerns regarding aluminum based deodorants I feel better using this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of my routine in the morning is to go about my business after a shower with my shirt off. The reasoning being that this deodorant rolls on wet and dries with time. I&#x27;d rather have the salt deposited on my skin and pores than my shirt so if it requires that I go about the morning sans shirt for a few minutes longer then so be it. The wife and kids don&#x27;t mind. The kids are young enough where they still have fun running around naked before bath time anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this roll-on doesn&#x27;t last a full 24 hours, I don&#x27;t really stink at the 20-24 hour mark. I&#x27;m sweating far less than I usually do and so far there&#x27;s been no staining on my white undershirts or dress shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a win win. 1 star taken away because it doesn&#x27;t last 24 hours and you have to wait after applying it for it to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Had to drop this deodorant 2 stars. It&#x27;s performance is really inconsistent. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a combination of the roller providing uneven application or if it&#x27;s how finicky the deodorant can be with the amount of time it wants to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t get good results on a regular basis and now my pits are becoming irritated within minutes of rolling some on. I&#x27;m going back to Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials. Not natural like Tom&#x27;s, but it works for more than 4 hours and doesn&#x27;t irritate me.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to deodorants with scents. This and Crystal Body Stick are the 2 I regularly use. The stick goes through airline security visibly in a tray. Don&#x27;t leave it in your carry-on. It looks to suspicious.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  No harmful chemicals.  No unwanted fragrance.</li>
