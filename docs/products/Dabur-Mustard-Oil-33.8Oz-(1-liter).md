### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have the best smell, but its for emergency hair saving.</li>
      <li>This product does a magnificent job on my hair.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product, I use it for my skin and hair.</li>
      <li>great product and delivered on time</li>
      <li>great product.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>In the beginning I loved this for my scalp</li>
      <li>This seems to be good quality oil.  </li>
      <li>it isn&#x27;t good ..</li>
      <li>It is true about the smell not being very good, but after a while you get used to it.</li>
      <li>I love dabur mustard oil,except it was leaking when I bought it .</li>
      <li>we are enjoying it.</li>
      <li>it was no longer a favorite</li>
      <li>Love this oil.</li>
      <li>you need teaspoon and warmed and massage area help alot most in your hands,</li>
      <li>OK I am going to give away my secret:&lt;br /&gt;Add</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t read the fine print when it arrived....</li>
      <li>Now it&#x27;s also very good for hair once you get past the smell, but I bought it to make authentic Goan Indian food.  </li>
      <li>While the description listed at the top has this as pure mustard oil, it does contain TBHQ as a preservative.</li>
      <li>Came quickly in the mail.</li>
      <li>I made great vindaloo and will use it for other things as well, BUT items not intended for comsumption should not be listed and sold from the grocery section!</li>
      <li>This size is more affordable than the smaller bottles</li>
      <li>so I decided to go with this as my first time ordering it.</li>
      <li>Perhaps it has more and that is why it says for external use.  </li>
      <li>Your legs definitely warm up when the oil hits them, but so far I have not seen any change in the status of those pesky red lines.</li>
      <li>So... I followed the advice of Julie Sahni&#x27;s cookbook and heated it on the stove in a ceramic pot until it smoked and then let it cool completely to temper it before cooking with it.  </li>
      <li>As I learn more about hollistic healing, my main goal is to ultimately never use any prescription narcotic or westernized medicines.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s not 100% pure mustard oil as there&#x27;s TBHQ, a preservative.</li>
      <li>This is a VERY mellow mustard oil.</li>
      <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t frizz as much when I don&#x27;t use leave in conditioner</li>
      <li>soooo very soft.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it feels so much healthier already.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I use this along with other oils for my hair and it really helps my hair become softer and more manageable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very compulsive about trying new things</li>
      <li>I then place a plastic bag over my hair for 3 hours and shower normally afterwards.</li>
      <li>I use it on my hair as a deep conditioner for thirty minutes before washing (always before, the smell is REALLY strong) and in my facial oil cleanser.</li>
      <li>It was great in helping to calm my eczema, some say the smell is a little strong, but it did not smell bad at all to me.</li>
      <li>Items like these should clearly state this in the description.</li>
      <li>but so far I like what it does.</li>
      <li>deliver wow use this product help with arthritis,smooth your skin you use for arthritis</li>
      <li>Smells funny but the benefits out weigh the smell, plus the smell only last a short while.</li>

<li> This bottle will last me a long time.</li>
<li> The product arrived to me, leaking into the contents of other products packaged with it.</li>
<li> I purchased this from grocery... for cooking, but when I got the bottle it said in small print &amp;#34;for external use only&amp;#34;.  </li>
<li> but this is a very bitter oil</li>
<li> I start off spraying my roots, down to the ends, and then massage my scalp for about 15 minutes.</li>
<li> but my hair sheds less now.</li>
<li> Who knows if this product has less than that amount in it.</li>
<li> It is a little too pricey for the amount you recieve.</li>
<li> After just TWO weeks my hair is growing faster than usual</li>
<li> I, like another customer stated, had purchased this oil for a dual purpose for cooking as well as a topical solution, so I was quite disappointed to read on the label that it was &amp;#34;for external use only&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> It was a very messy ordeal.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s way too late to return this, but the Amazon listing for the liter bottle did not say it was for hair.  </li>
<li> The cap was loose and it made the delivery very unpleasant and messy.</li>
<li> Sad that I can&#x27;t return this.</li>
<li> TOTALLY OILY AND WORTHLESS!</li>
<li> isn&#x27;t this illegal, kidding.  </li>
<li> Now, I am afraid to use it.  </li>
<li> It smell bad</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ordered a liter of it as a cooking oil ,when arrived it was labeled for external use only as a hair product. This is the second time I was misled by shipper.</li>
    <li> I love dabur mustard oil,except it was leaking when I bought it . I do not consume this oil , I use this oil in my hair.</li>
    <li> i rating 5 ++++ fst deliver wow use this product help with arthritis,smooth your skin you use for arthritis you need teaspoon and warmed and massage area help alot most in your hands,thank you price is graet I will do business in future price is wright,</li>
    <li> RECEIVED IT----GOOD PRODUCT</li>
    <li> This is a VERY mellow mustard oil. Also, it&#x27;s not 100% pure mustard oil as there&#x27;s TBHQ, a preservative. Sad that I can&#x27;t return this.</li>
    <li> This seems to be good quality oil.  It is well packed in a plastic bottle covered with cellophane.  I would prefer a glass bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
    <li> Will last me for a while...</li>
    <li> Smells funny but the benefits out weigh the smell, plus the smell only last a short while.</li>
    <li> My partner wanted this as he was having problems with his gums.  He began to use it and immediately his gums improved.  I used it on my gums when they were bothering me.  It worked!</li>
    <li> I thought this was for cooking, but it was for massage. I didn&#x27;t see this in the info, I guess I missed it. But I probably missed it because I was in the section looking for food cooking, not massage. Don&#x27;t put the cooking stuff mixed in with the non edible stuff. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I use this regularly in my hair conditioner.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I, like another customer stated, had purchased this oil for a dual purpose for cooking as well as a topical solution, so I was quite disappointed to read on the label that it was &amp;#34;for external use only&amp;#34;. Items like these should clearly state this in the description.</li>
    <li> TOTALLY OILY AND WORTHLESS!</li>
    <li> I purchased this from grocery... for cooking, but when I got the bottle it said in small print &amp;#34;for external use only&amp;#34;.  Now it&#x27;s also very good for hair once you get past the smell, but I bought it to make authentic Goan Indian food.  So... I followed the advice of Julie Sahni&#x27;s cookbook and heated it on the stove in a ceramic pot until it smoked and then let it cool completely to temper it before cooking with it.  I made great vindaloo and will use it for other things as well, BUT items not intended for comsumption should not be listed and sold from the grocery section!</li>
    <li> I use this along with other oils for my hair and it really helps my hair become softer and more manageable.</li>
    <li> Came quickly in the mail. Used last night no problems.</li>
    <li> OK I am going to give away my secret:&lt;br /&gt;Add this to your conditioner. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your hair and skin, just from it washing off on your body in the shower, will be soooo very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have the best smell, but its for emergency hair saving.</li>
    <li> The product arrived to me, leaking into the contents of other products packaged with it. It was a very messy ordeal. The cap was loose and it made the delivery very unpleasant and messy. I have yet to see any medicinal improvement use using this product. I purchased it as a remedy for the arthritis in my hands. I have used it for 2 weeks now and I see no change. It is a little too pricey for the amount you recieve.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for my hair. It smell bad but so far I like what it does. I have to keep using it but my hair sheds less now.</li>
    <li> While the description listed at the top has this as pure mustard oil, it does contain TBHQ as a preservative. I had bought this to use for cooking, but since I can&#x27;t return it I&#x27;ll see if it helps my hair any.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s way too late to return this, but the Amazon listing for the liter bottle did not say it was for hair.  I bought it for making Indian food.  Now, I am afraid to use it.  It contains the additive TBHQ and when I looked it up there was an upper limit allowed by the FDA.  Who knows if this product has less than that amount in it. Perhaps it has more and that is why it says for external use.  What a rip off.  I didn&#x27;t read the fine print when it arrived....maybe someone I know would like it for their hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I was told rubbing mustard oil on your legs will remove spider veins. Your legs definitely warm up when the oil hits them, but so far I have not seen any change in the status of those pesky red lines.</li>
    <li> Love this oil. I use it on my hair as a deep conditioner for thirty minutes before washing (always before, the smell is REALLY strong) and in my facial oil cleanser. This bottle will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  This product does a magnificent job on my hair.  I will definitely purchase Dabur Mustard Oil again!</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading and Asian Recipe in a Doctors office or somewhere and forget it&#x27;s use&lt;br /&gt;.. I&#x27;m very compulsive about trying new things but this is a very bitter oil -- that&#x27;s not to&lt;br /&gt;say it isn&#x27;t good .. i just am unsure of it&#x27;s purpose!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I use it for my skin and hair. It was great in helping to calm my eczema, some say the smell is a little strong, but it did not smell bad at all to me.</li>
    <li> isn&#x27;t this illegal, kidding.  great product and delivered on time</li>
    <li> As I learn more about hollistic healing, my main goal is to ultimately never use any prescription narcotic or westernized medicines. I rub this on my sinus and it clears me up and works . I will buy this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> great product. we are enjoying it.</li>
    <li> This size is more affordable than the smaller bottles so I decided to go with this as my first time ordering it. It is true about the smell not being very good, but after a while you get used to it. I bought this product for my hair. After some research, I decided to use this once a week. I start off spraying my roots, down to the ends, and then massage my scalp for about 15 minutes. I then place a plastic bag over my hair for 3 hours and shower normally afterwards. After just TWO weeks my hair is growing faster than usual (I dyed my hair a few weeks before starting to use this, so it&#x27;s easier to tell by the roots how much my hair has grown). My hair doesn&#x27;t frizz as much when I don&#x27;t use leave in conditioner and it feels so much healthier already. Will DEFINITELY be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> In the beginning I loved this for my scalp but then things changed it was no longer a favorite</li>
