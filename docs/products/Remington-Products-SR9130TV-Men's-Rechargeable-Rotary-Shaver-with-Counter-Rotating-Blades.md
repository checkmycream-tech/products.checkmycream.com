      <li>He does not have mustache; but, he found a good use for the trimmer.</li>

      <li>This is good because you can travel with just a cord, not</li>
      <li>The pivoting rotating blades really do a good job on the neck and jaw line.  </li>
      <li>Over all the product is good and is recommended.</li>
      <li>I like the quick shave with this Remington the best.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t matter because the shave is very good; close and comfortable.    </li>
      <li>He loves to look great and likes to try out the latest grooming products on the market.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t use any kind of pre-shave product -</li>
      <li>The best part of the product is how easy it is to clean.  </li>
      <li>I decided to go with this product to see if remington was as good or better.</li>
      <li>the multi-voltage charger and LCD capacity display are nice touches.</li>
      <li>Gives a nice close shave.  </li>
      <li>If I can get a good two or three years out this unit I will be satisfied.</li>
      <li>Gave this to my son to use and he isn&#x27;t thrilled.</li>
      <li>Honestly it gives a closer shave than any of the Norelcos</li>
      <li>He liked the appearance and feel of the shaver.</li>
      <li>While I won&#x27;t often use the rotary portion, the pop-up trimmer is definitely effective, making this a quality backup electric shaver.</li>
      <li>for an electric razor, it is the best I have ever used thanks to its simplicity.  </li>
      <li>That said, the trimmer does work very nice and the more I use the razor the better I get at controlling the shaving blades.  </li>
      <li>This product is an attractive shaver, and I was impressed by how long the charge lasted.  </li>
      <li>I have mostly been a manual razor guy for most of my life because I have yet to find a quality electric shaver that gives as good a shave as a blade.  </li>
      <li>It is a fine razor and a good value.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not so good on fine hairs.</li>
      <li>I bought this shaver about a month ago, and so far it&#x27;s been the best one I&#x27;ve had.</li>
      <li>So far it has been perfect.</li>
      <li>No tearing, no patchiness, just a good clean shave.</li>
      <li>It is easy to keep clean, and it has a very nice look to it.</li>
      <li>So it isn&#x27;t very accurate.</li>
      <li>I would have to say it shaves as close but requires a couple more circuits.</li>
      <li>This shaver seems to be better at preventing the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but this is probably more of an issue concerning me as opposed to the razor.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used electric shavers that do a better job w/ dense beards.</li>
      <li>I was expecting a better</li>
      <li>Eventually I started to use the better quality Norelcos and was fairly satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>I like the razor and would give it 5 stars if I knew I would become a better judge of the control issue over the coming weeks...</li>
      <li>However, he felt it could have done a better job at shaving the area between his nose and top lip.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for over a year and enjoyed using it every time.</li>
      <li>Spoke to Remington customer service; they said Top portion is not under warranty</li>
      <li>His comments, \\&quot;I love the fact that it holds a battery charge for about 60 minutes.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a display showing how many minutes of charge remains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This model has nice battery life and is comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not heavier but it still feels better in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;-long battery</li>
      <li>Of course, most electric shavers aren&#x27;t as close as razors, but I do like the attachment and quality of the device.</li>
      <li>I feel I get a better shave with the Mach 5</li>
      <li>Here are a couple of more problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this razor because it was recommended, and it does perform better than the one I had.</li>
      <li>outstanding.</li>
      <li>Well-built shaver, but better for some than others.</li>
      <li>This shaver quietly &amp; quickly delivers a good, comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>using electric shaver to avoid buying blades is a great reason to try this new Remington Razor.  </li>
      <li>He believes the best result will probably be achieved by a wet shaver, but hasn&#x27;t tried one of those yet.</li>
      <li>provides a great shave even on 2 -3 day old stubble with a course beard.  </li>
      <li>The product is OK, not great!&lt;br /&gt;It does not have case or stand and the box was not the original box.</li>
      <li>Easy cleaning of shaver heads under running water.     </li>
      <li>The plastic cover that protects the blade area falls off easily</li>
      <li>The razor is light, and easy to hold.  </li>
      <li>This is fine for me, but I don&#x27;t have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
      <li>It is also easy to use and easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>Is it accurate?</li>
      <li>When I saw it was available through the Amazon Vine program, I ordered it for a family friend.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a reason you can&#x27;t buy Remington shavers in the stores - because then, you&#x27;d have the opportunity to pick one up, hold it and see and feel how cheap it is.  </li>
      <li>The razor worked great and gave me a close enough shave where I did not have</li>
      <li>Razor shaves well, is comfortable, not too noisy but there are a couple of things that lower its rating for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The shaver is comfortable.</li>
      <li>I did review the manufactureers of different electric shavers, both rechargeable and not rechargeable and have had no problem with charging of this unit and quite happy with my decision to purchase this one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s comfortable, won&#x27;t knick or cut the skin.</li>
      <li>It does not pull on my beard and glides over my face smoothly.</li>
      <li>Also great is the simple, no-fuss cleaning.</li>
      <li>If you have more &#x27;regular&#x27; hair, it seems to be a good buy.</li>
      <li>So far this has done a good job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>trimmer has worked fine for trimming&lt;br /&gt;-easy to clean</li>
      <li>The razor recharges quickly for easy use.</li>
      <li>This is the second remington rotary that I have owned, and while the prior one was excellent, this one is even better.  </li>
      <li>Rich~</li>
      <li>Besides, the chrome finish looks cool and fits comfortably in the hand.</li>
      <li>Shaver cleaning is fast &amp; easy, too!</li>
      <li>followed the manual as to how to clean it</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since getting this Remington it&#x27;s my preferred way of getting clean shaven.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This shaver simply does not eliminate or overcome the shortcomings of electrics: that is, it doesn&#x27;t shave close, and it is big and bulky.&lt;br /&gt;There is not much to say about the closeness issue (but I will say it anyway).  I have a thick beard, so take that into consideration.  I like a close, smooth shave, and while it always seems like my \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; comes in quicker after even the best electric shave, I have used some electric shavers (e.g., Braun) that will cut close enough to count as \\&quot;smooth.\\&quot;  This one just doesn&#x27;t do it.  The shave was uneven after multiple passes, and I just could not eliminate the rough stubble.  If it matters to your research, I shaved with this thing before showering and I didn&#x27;t use any kind of pre-shave product - but hey, if I have to take extra steps to get this thing to work, why not just shave the hard way?&lt;br /&gt;And, this unit is bulky.  It cannot pack easily and takes up too much space in an office drawer or briefcase.  In action, it seemed like I was rubbing a chrome toaster over my face.&lt;br /&gt;If you need an electric, look at the Brauns.</li>
    <li> This gets four stars because it does shave well, but not five because it is a bit bulky and the time remaining indicator is a bit useless.    I&#x27;ve only used Norelcos all my life, so that is my point of comparison. The one I have is likely 10 years old and still working fine (I&#x27;ve replaced the rechargable battery a few times).     The Remington gives a very good shave. I don&#x27;t know if the counter-rotating blades do anything (I think they don&#x27;t) but it doesn&#x27;t matter because the shave is very good; close and comfortable.    On the downside, the head of this is much bigger, perhaps to accomodate the counter-rotating mechanism. Regardless as to why, the distance between the cutting blade and edge of the head is much bigger on the Remington compared to the Norelco. This matters if you are shaving under your nose and find the cutting survace cannot reach the are 1/4 inch or so below your nose. You end up having to cram it into your nose to reach. I&#x27;ve uploaded a picture to show the relative dimensions. One line is shown where the cutting surface starts, the other where the shaver ends. No cutting happens between these two lines. Note the difference in distance between the two models.    The second gripe is the digital display of time. When you recharge it it starts at 60 minutes left. It goes down little by little as you use it. However at about 10 minutes or so, the razor stops and needs to be recharged. So it isn&#x27;t very accurate. You don&#x27;t have 10 minutes (2 shaves) left when it says you do. Luckily I brought the charging cord on my last business trip.    The charger cord is a bit bulky. The Norelco just has a simple cord while the Remington has a \\&quot;wall-wart\\&quot; on one end. This makes it a bit bulkier. With the razor itself being large, it makes for a much bigger overall package to pack if you&#x27;re traveling. On the plus side, the charger handles both 110 and 220, so it is convenient for overseas travel.    It is a fine razor and a good value. It just isn&#x27;t as comforatble touse or as compact as the Norelco and you might consider if the price difference is worth it.</li>
    <li> Just my two cents. I&#x27;ve been using a norelco rotary shaver for the last few years. It finally gave out. I decided to go with this product to see if remington was as good or better. I was just a little disappointed. I would have to say it shaves as close but requires a couple more circuits. It is a little bit bulkier than my previous one plus it won&#x27;t set on its back so the heads remain facing up. That&#x27;s a little thing but I was so used to it with my norelco. The plastic cover was a little bit bothersome to put back on after each shave so I&#x27;ve kinda quit using it. I like the digital display showing the amount of time left on the battery. I do plan on using this one for a while.</li>
    <li> I was a little surprised at the close shave this shaver gives. Of course it is not as good as a regular blade razor, but for an electric razor it is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s comfortable, won&#x27;t knick or cut the skin. Doesn&#x27;t tug on skin at all and cuts right through hair or stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bulky, but not difficult to manage. It charges quickly and feels like a solid build. I expect it to last and not fall apart on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts long enough to get a full shave in and the blades do not get hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good buy, even though I still prefer a regular blade razor.</li>
    <li> I have mostly been a manual razor guy for most of my life because I have yet to find a quality electric shaver that gives as good a shave as a blade.  But I like to keep one on hand just when I need a quick save because I do not have time for shaving cream and all the other rituals that come along with a blade.  This Remington Rechargeable Shaver gives me about as good a shave as other electric shaver.  It has the same flaws that I have experienced with other electric shaver like it is hard to shave the hair on the upper lip just under the nose and the shave is no way near close as one you get with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for an electric razor, it is the best I have ever used thanks to its simplicity.  It is rechargeable and what is really nice is that it counts down the amount of time you have left on your change so it should never die mid charge.  But you can use it while it is plugged in if you need to.  The best part of the product is how easy it is to clean.  All you have to do is rinse with water after every use then once a week put some liquid soap on the blade and run under water.  No need for any pricy replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative trimmer that is include it pretty flimsy making it hard to get a straight trim of the sideburns.  Thankfully I have other products that trim much better, but be warned if you do not.  It should also be noted that, this really only works well on stubble and anything over three or four days worth of growth will be hard to shave with this product.</li>
    <li> As others have pointed out, this razor has some great features:&lt;br /&gt;- can run with or without cord&lt;br /&gt;- washable&lt;br /&gt;- good trimmer feature&lt;br /&gt;- clear batter remaining feature&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, though, the 3-head rotary style just doesn&#x27;t work well, as compared to the straight line foil style.  I generally shave parts of my face, and leave other parts unshaven, and it is pretty much impossible to get this kind of control with the 3-head rotary style of razor.</li>
    <li> My husband says that he likes this a lot. As we head out to a dinner, he uses Remington to quickly shave off the afternoon shadow. He does not have mustache; but, he found a good use for the trimmer. He uses the trimmer to trim the hair around his ears. Over all, he says that the product feel solid. Since he doesn&#x27;t care for bells and whistles on his grooming devices, this does its job and it does its job well. The only reason it did not get five star is that it is a bit loud. When he shaves, the noise doesn&#x27;t bother him. However, when he uses it to trim the hair around his ears, the noise does bother him a bit. Over all the product is good and is recommended.</li>
    <li> I have a Norelco 7800xl which was my first electric razor. I&#x27;ve been using an electric for over a year and I know it&#x27;s what I like. The thing that I liked the least about my Norelco is that it was slow to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I like the quick shave with this Remington the best. It is a tradeoff in that it doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close. This is fine for me, but I don&#x27;t have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. I don&#x27;t know if there is a perfect electric razor--but take a look at my pros and cons and see if it&#x27;s for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-shaves quickly. Takes me less time than my previous shaver with fewer passes.&lt;br /&gt;-big size-- it&#x27;s a lot bigger than my Norelco. It&#x27;s not heavier but it still feels better in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;-long battery -- I think I only charge it about once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-not as close shave as my previous shaver. But again, I trade that for the speed.&lt;br /&gt;-battery not replaceable (I&#x27;ve never replaced a battery in a shaver or most other devices with replaceable batteries--but I like knowing I could if I wanted to. Is&#x27;nt that stupid?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other:&lt;br /&gt;-popout trimmer has worked fine for trimming&lt;br /&gt;-easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;-cord is long enough and is the same plug as my old shaver so it seems to be standard&lt;br /&gt;-the heads aren&#x27;t as flexible as my norelco, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues where it didn&#x27;t reach.</li>
    <li> Being the caretaker of my father I knew he needed a new razor. He had a Norelco that needed to be buried. It was very old and literally on its last charge but he was too stubborn to try anything else. I asked him if he would try the Remington. He has only used Norelco or Braun in the past. Having used only electric razors his whole life, and in his mid 60&#x27;s, I knew he would like the Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington is clearly superior to his other razors. The titanium blades do a good job without the cutting and pulling feeling of the other brands and I expect they will last longer than the others have. While not exactly a compact razor, the increased head size allows him to shave more quickly than others and the larger battery size allows you to go longer between charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He travels to Germany a few times a year and the multi-voltage charger and LCD capacity display are nice touches. Besides, the chrome finish looks cool and fits comfortably in the hand. I would not hesitate to recommend this razor to anyone who uses electric razors and wants a quick, painless, and quick shave.</li>
    <li> The Remington Shaver has a very attractive appearance and looks like a great way to get rid of the whiskers. When I saw it was available through the Amazon Vine program, I ordered it for a family friend. He loves to look great and likes to try out the latest grooming products on the market. I knew he could add a lot to the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product came packed in a plain cardboard box, I assume this was because it was a Vine item. It has a solid feel in the hand and is rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend tried it on his whiskers and overall his comments were very positive. He liked the appearance and feel of the shaver. He was also pleased that it holds a battery charge for a long time. However, he felt it could have done a better job at shaving the area between his nose and top lip. His comments, \\&quot;I love the fact that it holds a battery charge for about 60 minutes.  The closeness of the shave is just as close as any other electric shaver that I have used before on my chin.  The only negative I would say is that it doesn&#x27;t get a close shave on the area between my nose and top lip, because of the round head of the shaver..my old shaver that has a flat head gets a much closer shave in that area. I would recommend it to a friend\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a solid shaver at an affordable price point.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This shaver is the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  Gives a nice close shave.  The pivoting rotating blades really do a good job on the neck and jaw line.  I was really surprised as to how well it worked.  Very happy to recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I hate shaving and I hate buying razor blades and using electric shaver to avoid buying blades is a great reason to try this new Remington Razor.  Because I hate shaving I always have 3-4 days worth of facial hair and thus using my Mach 5 takes awhile because there is so much hair to remove.  I was hesitant to try an electric razor because about 20 years ago I got my grandfathers old razor and it took half the skin off of my face.  The Remington was very smooth and did not pull my 4 day growth the few times I have used it.  I feel I get a better shave with the Mach 5 if I shave on a daily basis but the Remington is my go to razor when I have a few days of growth.</li>
    <li> Had this for 3 months and  since I cleaned it  last week it&#x27;s become VERY loud whenever I turn it on .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the manual as to how to clean it so I&#x27;m confused as to why it&#x27;s gotten so loud . Has  anybody else experienced this with this model ? .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feedback would be  greatly  appreciated .</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with this razor.  The only issue I have is the shave control around my moustache.  I find the three rotary heads to be a bit clumsy as I shave around the edges.  That said, the trimmer does work very nice and the more I use the razor the better I get at controlling the shaving blades.  I previously used a Remington two-bladed razor before I switched to this Remington rotary blade shaver and experienced the same issue with that before I developed a sense about the path of the blades.  I think the same will be true for this razor.  The charge lasts for a long time.  I have gone on a week long trip without the power cord and the charge seemed to be as strong at the end of the trip as it was at the start.  No pulling, no drag and still a very smooth shave.  I like the razor and would give it 5 stars if I knew I would become a better judge of the control issue over the coming weeks... but this is probably more of an issue concerning me as opposed to the razor.  For those persons who don&#x27;t have a moustashe or goatee this razor is a great purchase that provides a great shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several electric shavers over the years, and after a few months, always eventually went back to blades. Electric shavers never seem to shave closely enough, and always have trouble shaving in the more difficult areas (under the nose, primarily). For me, this one is no exception, unfortunately. It&#x27;s a decent shave, but it&#x27;s still not a complete shave, so to speak -- I still need to spend extra time trying to get the same type of shave as a blade, and even more time using a blade to shave the areas that the electric shaver can&#x27;t handle. I imagine if you have a light, soft, sparse beard, this may work well for you, but if you have a &#x27;normal&#x27; to heavy beard, this one probably won&#x27;t do well for you, either.</li>
    <li> Razor shaves well, is comfortable, not too noisy but there are a couple of things that lower its rating for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it say corded/cordless.  It&#x27;s my experience that when the cord is connected it will only charge, you have to remove the cord to power the unit up.  Not that big a deal unless you forget to charge, and it takes a lot of neglect to let the battery get that far down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bigger issue is the hinge mechanism  where the shaver head attaches to the body.  Easy to flip open for cleaning, but extremely flimsy, especially compared to previous Remingtons.  As everyone does from time to time, I accidentally dropped the shaver (head closed) and it fell three or four feet to the floor.  I must admit this is not the first time, I have done this over the years.  However, with every other shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned, including Remingtons, this is not a problem.  With this unit, though, the itty-bitty hinge broke immediately, and so now the shaver is useless unless I&#x27;m willing to duct tape the head assembly to the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ve got to buy a new head.  Problem is that this unit doesn&#x27;t use a head compatible with any other Remington shaver, and it costs $30.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months now. It&#x27;s as close a shave as you&#x27;ll get with an electric. It does not pull on my beard and glides over my face smoothly. The battery easily lasts for week-long trips with extra battery to spare. I&#x27;m very happy with this razor.</li>
    <li> Battery life is good. The shaver is comfortable. It&#x27;s not so good on fine hairs. You really have to press hard to get them picked up and cut.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical to get this razor, having tried many in the past.  The razor worked great and gave me a close enough shave where I did not have a five o&#x27; clock shadow buy the end of the day.  The razor is light, and easy to hold.  It has about a 60 minutes charge which is long enough and is indicated on the display of the razor.  Overall I think this product is great, and has become my shaving solution instead of the old shaving cream and disposable.</li>
    <li> I get good shaves with this Remington shaver. Though, as another reviewer noted, it does leave a little stubble behind which (for me) can be removed with very slow and concentrated circular motions. The pop-up trimmer works nicely, though a bit awkward to use at first because the shaver itself (which comfortably fits in your hand shaving, but not so much trimming) becomes the \\&quot;handle\\&quot; when you switch to the much smaller trimmer which pops out of the back of the shaver. Also great is the simple, no-fuss cleaning. Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the Remington SR9130TV shaver. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll get right to the point:    Positives:  1. \\&quot;Floating heads\\&quot; follow the curves of the face and neck well for a close shave  2. Easy cleaning of shaver heads under running water.     Negatives:   1. Although lightweight in the hand, plastic shaver body may break if dropped.  2. Entire shaver head needs to be replaced when dull: blades are incased in plastic.  Other review cites cost of shaver head at 1/2 cost of new shaver.  3. Question whether inside plastic parts will be as durable as metal.    Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I had been using a Norelco for about 6 months that just didn&#x27;t give a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;With the Remington, my face is smoother after 12 hours than the Norelco immediately after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with it. No tearing, no patchiness, just a good clean shave. And I forgot to take my charger on a two week international business trip but the battery lasted with no problems.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my son to use and he isn&#x27;t thrilled. To be fair, he does have a heavy beard and unfortunately, this shaver isn&#x27;t getting close enough to be worthwhile. It also tugs a bit at the face which isn&#x27;t fun. He went back to his regular razor and has given up on this electric.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend wanted to try this one, so I grabbed it for him. He has been looking for an electric shaver that works for his face forever without much luck. This one was no different in performance than any of the others he has tried over many years. It provides a reasonably close shave on his cheeks and chin, but any attempt to get a close shave on his neck results in some razor burn. He believes the best result will probably be achieved by a wet shaver, but hasn&#x27;t tried one of those yet. Frustration with the various offerings makes it hard to try new products since they tend to be fairly expensive and you can&#x27;t do much with them if you use them long enough to give them a fair trial before deciding they aren&#x27;t for you.  The more recent five blade razors provide him a much better result than any electric he has ever tried. They shave smoother on cheeks and chin while also shaving his neck without cuts or burns. As a result, it&#x27;s time to buy more blades until an opportunity to try a wet razor arises.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor for several reasons.  It&#x27;s easy to use wirelessly or with the charger cord, there is a timer that tells how much time is left on the current charge (each charge gives you 60 minutes of shave time), it has a trimmer on the back that he uses to trim his sideburns, and it provides a close shave.  He went from a corded shaver to this, and much prefers this.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and travel with and has quiet operation.  The only thing he doesn&#x27;t like about it is that the trimmer does not lock into place and tends to flip back into the storage position when he is using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver about a month ago, and so far it&#x27;s been the best one I&#x27;ve had. I get a closer shave than any I&#x27;ve tried so far. It is easy to keep clean, and it has a very nice look to it. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because I haven&#x27;t had it long enough. However&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this one .</li>
    <li> Even though it seems a bit big and heavy, it does a wonderful job getting the whiskers to disappear. I like it!</li>
    <li> So far this has done a good job.&lt;br /&gt;I thought the rotating heads might be a gimmick, but I believe they actually wear more evenly and cut more consistently as a result.</li>
    <li> The razor recharges quickly for easy use.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave is closer.  ( I notice this too, his 5 oclock shadow shows up a couple hours later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less ingrown hairs. My husband has difficulty with some stubborn hairs that shaving irritates.  This shaver seems to be better at preventing the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charge indicator is in minutes, this is much more useful than the \\&quot;percentage\\&quot; left circle on his old razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is even easier than the Norelco, quick rinse and it is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The cover is flimsy and no stand is included.  A stand is nice, especially after it is cleaned to allow it to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The surface area is larger, this is good for the flat planes of the face but harder on the curves. He finds shaving around his chin and upper lip harder with this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good shaver at the price point.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend or \\&quot;significant other\\&quot; and he really likes it. He previously had a Norelco triple-head razor which he&#x27;s had for at least 25 years so it was difficult prying that away from him since it has done a great job for him all these years.  He just had to replace the heads/blades on that Norelco and it continued to work great.  So.. compared to this Remington, which is cordless, unlike his Norelco, it has some added features that he likes.  First of all is the freedom from the cord, of course.  It is also easy to use and easy to clean.  He doesn&#x27;t use water to clean it, personal preference, I think, but he just blows it out after each use.  The charge seems to last a long time and the power indicator on the handle is handy and a really nice added feature.  The pivoting head doesn&#x27;t really seem to make a big difference to him, he says, but he adds that is not a negative as it still provides a nice, close shave and kissable skin (okay, that last part was my addition, but it&#x27;s true!)  So, ladies, this makes a great gift and guys, you&#x27;ll like it!  :)</li>
    <li> The shaver works fine; however as having used only a razor for the past 55 years it did take 7-10 days to feel totally comfortable using an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the internet I did review the manufactureers of different electric shavers, both rechargeable and not rechargeable and have had no problem with charging of this unit and quite happy with my decision to purchase this one.</li>
    <li> This is a good shaver if you like the rotary style. I am partial to the foil style because those are easier for precision, but overall this is a handy item. While I won&#x27;t often use the rotary portion, the pop-up trimmer is definitely effective, making this a quality backup electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I am the skinniest man alive, and my face is rough, craggy and uneven. Worse yet, I don&#x27;t shave every day. This shaver quietly &amp; quickly delivers a good, comfortable shave. Shaver cleaning is fast &amp; easy, too!</li>
    <li> I find that if you&#x27;re willing to spend this much on an electric shaver, you might as well go the extra mile (i.e. spend the extra money) to get a Philips Norelco -- something alongs the lines of the 1290x/40 Senso Touch. Something like the Norelco will ultimately provide a smoother, closer shave in fewer strokes than this and offers better features, such as longer battery life and a Jet Clean system which cleans and ultimately increases the product life of your shaver. This is not to say the Remington is a bad product, for it stands up to its competition in this price range. I just think that if you are someone who has to shave on a daily basis, you owe it to yourself to think big and think in terms of not having to replace your shaver after only a couple years of use. I actually own this and the aforementioned Norelco shaver (the Norelco I keep upstairs in our main bathroom and the Remington I keep downstairs in the guest bathroom for company, but I&#x27;ve used both regularly).</li>
    <li> It works OK to begin with, with the beginning lasting about 3 months.  After that, it&#x27;s a really tedious job trying to get all your stubble mowed down.  Now it takes 10 minutes to get a decent (and I do mean merely decent, with shadow still readily apparent) shave.  Not only that, but it&#x27;s starting to make a rattling noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had thought my previous Norelco was crappy because it was about half the price of this Remington.  Turns out that cost is no factor in being burned by crappy merchandise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I buy 3 or 4 of these per year, I can get a so-so shave for a mere $600 or so.</li>
    <li> I need to shave every day. While I tend not to shave on weekends, I find the remington does a better job than blades or other electric razors I have owned over the years.  This is the second remington rotary that I have owned, and while the prior one was excellent, this one is even better.  I posted the first paragraph when I first purchased this shaver. after five months, I still think it is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned and while a blade may be better the difference is not worth the occasional bleeding.  It is a little large and unwieldy perhaps on the upper lip but since I have a moustache and never shave my upper lip, this doesn&#x27;t matter to me.  The shaving part is washable in water and soap, but since it is not supposed to be detached, cleaning it can be a bit strange.</li>
    <li> Well-built shaver, but better for some than others. I have dense facial hair. This razor doesn&#x27;t pick up enough hair from my skin to be so effective. Of course, most electric shavers aren&#x27;t as close as razors, but I do like the attachment and quality of the device. It&#x27;s just not for my hair type. I&#x27;ve used electric shavers that do a better job w/ dense beards. If you have more &#x27;regular&#x27; hair, it seems to be a good buy.</li>
    <li> The product is OK, not great!&lt;br /&gt;It does not have case or stand and the box was not the original box. I was expecting a better presentation.&lt;br /&gt;I will go with a Norelco next time ... if there is a next time!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Shipped this to my husband in Afghanistan after his broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He likes it but has stated \\&quot;it could be smoother\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;But either way, he likes it for it&#x27;s uses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 57 year old man, for the first 20 years of my life I shaved only with a blade because I could never find an electric that was comparable. Eventually I started to use the better quality Norelcos and was fairly satisfied with the results. I had never changed the blades on any of the Norelco shavers, I would basically keep them for three years and then get a new one.  In the past few years though Norelco became confusing with theirs varying models and the pricing kept increasing. I thought I would step up to one of their models that was well over $150 and though it&#x27;s design and features were sleek I actually felt the shave was not as good as the \\&quot;lesser\\&quot; models, so I went back to the $70 Norelco and was happier with the results. This year I was in the market for a new shaver and although I have always liked the Norelco products their product line has become even more confusing and more expensive with models near or beyond $200 and I don&#x27;t want to pay that much. I was about to commit to one of their over $100 dollar models when I was at the store and stumbled across the Remington model that was around $70, I hesitated a bit because I had unfavorable experiences with Remington in the past but eventually bought it. I guess the biggest selling point for me was the digital time display, I really like having that feature and to get that on a Norelco you are over the $100 dollar mark and also I like the corded/cordless option that you don&#x27;t get on the upper end Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;About me: I shave every other day, I have a thick beard but fairly sensitive skin, I never shave in a hurry so can&#x27;t really compare time.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve used Norelcos before you will find the ergos on the Remington a bit awkward and clunky at first and as other reviewers have stated the flex head makes some noise as it moves but you will get used to it. Honestly it gives a closer shave than any of the Norelcos I have used and seems no better or no worse at shaving under the nostrils (which is alwaysan issue with this type of shaver) but with a few contortions of the face it is all doable. Like I said, time is not really an issue for me when shaving but I do like the digital readout so as to know when to charge. Is it accurate? I didn&#x27;t compare it to a clock, that doesn&#x27;t matter just as long as you know when you are down to 5 or 3 minutes you need to recharge and the recharge is very quick, less than a couple hours it seems. And as far as the digital readout going down to the last few minutes the shaver felt at full strength with only 3 minutes left. The shaver itself feels like it&#x27;s not made as sturdy and the cord plug in is not as positive as the Norelco but I guess time will tell how these issues play out. If I can get a good two or three years out this unit I will be satisfied. I have been using this shaver for about 4 months, no problems. Oh yeah, the flip up trimmer is the same as on any shaver and you can rinse the head off in the sink with hot water.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Remington products, bought this shaver few months ago. When received i immediately noticed its very bulky. After using few weeks the top start to come off. The lock mechanism does not work properly and it opens up randomly making shaved hair come out flying. Bad design. Spoke to Remington customer service; they said Top portion is not under warranty only the body has manufacturer’s warranty. I would not recomed this product to any one. Better put your money in other company shavers.</li>
    <li> This product is an attractive shaver, and I was impressed by how long the charge lasted.  Unfortunately, it does not shave close enough for me.  It was also rather irritating for my skin, although I do tend to have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Works great at  a good price</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my hubby and it is very nice.  It gives a ultra close and smooth shave and the floating head plate with couter rotating action blades provides a great shave even on 2 -3 day old stubble with a course beard.  The trimmer is adequate and the only draw back is it is a bit heavy and bulky but I would certainly not let that be a negative factor against this great razor.  A 5 star items as far as I am concerned and a good value at the price with what you ultimately get. It also is a rinse and go shaver which makes cleaning a snap.  Rich~</li>
    <li> Got this as a replacement for my other Remmington. So far it has been perfect. Got it before last Christmas.</li>
    <li> Works well and well surpasses the razor that replaced it.  Recharges extremely fast and erases even the stubble left from not shaving for days.</li>
    <li> I rarely used electrics in the past - wanted to try one again. Nice for occasions when I need to dash out at the end of the day or when the sink is not handy for the traditional shaving method.  This model has nice battery life and is comfortable to use. The plastic cover that protects the blade area falls off easily so I just recycled it. This model was chosen because it did not need to sit in a large charger that takes up space. It can also be used while on the charging cord.</li>
    <li> Junk.  There&#x27;s a reason you can&#x27;t buy Remington shavers in the stores - because then, you&#x27;d have the opportunity to pick one up, hold it and see and feel how cheap it is.  It seems they resurrected an industrial design team from the 70s to design this gear.  It&#x27;s large.  Fake chrome abounds.  The wide bezel surrounding the shaver heads makes shaving under your nostrils a chore.  Here are a couple of more problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. No carrying case - one of the main reasons I selected this model is its simple cord that plugs straight into the shaver for recharging.  This is good because you can travel with just a cord, not a charging stand the size of a microwave.  But without a case, the only thing protecting the heads is a cheap plastic cover that will be lost or broken in short order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. No power switch lock to keep the unit from turning on inadvertently in your luggage.  Of course, the lack of carrying case exacerbates this.  It&#x27;s a good thing the cord is small, because you will need to take it for those times you get to your destination with a totally discharged shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaves OK, is reasonably priced, and it ultimately is a shaver, hence the fair-and-balanced three stars.  But if your asking yourself, \\&quot;Are the Phillips-Norelco shavers really worth $100 more?\\&quot;  My opinion is:  yes, in this case, you get what you pay for.  I fell for a consumersearch.com review.  No need for you to do the same.</li>
    <li> I am extremely well satisfied with the razor. It shaves very close and smooth. I charge it once a week and it always has power to spare. I bought this razor because it was recommended, and it does perform better than the one I had. The power charger is good, but I would just as soon have one that does not have a stand with it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have super-thick facial hair, so I usually don&#x27;t have problems with electric shavers. It&#x27;s no surprise then that this is an effective enough shaver for me. It pulls at the occasional hair more than my [[ASIN:B006W2SZT8 Norelco shaver]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave, though not as close as you&#x27;d get with a blade, is plenty close for me. The shaver itself is a bit large and clunky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sideburns shaver is a bit lame. It works, but it&#x27;s awkward to operate and not as effective as my Norelco shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a recommendable shaver, if not outstanding. I&#x27;m not abandoning my Norelco any time soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for over a year and enjoyed using it every time. Once fully charged I&#x27;ll get an hour usage out of it, enough for about 20 shaves. There&#x27;s a display showing how many minutes of charge remains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head moves easily, making it easy to shave the edge of my face, and the blades are close enough to the edge that getting those stubborn hairs right beneath my nose is fairly easy. It feels solid and well-balanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like being able to quickly clean the shaver by popping open the top and putting it under a running faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found two minor downsides. The provided charger will NOT plug into the standard 2-prong outlet in most bathrooms. It requires a 3-prong socket. The second issue is that I&#x27;ve opened the top sometimes when grabbing the shaver by the head, spilling dust over everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since getting this Remington it&#x27;s my preferred way of getting clean shaven.</li>
