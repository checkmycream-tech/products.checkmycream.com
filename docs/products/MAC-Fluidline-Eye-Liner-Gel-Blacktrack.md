      <li>I absolutely love this eyeliner, it was given to me as a gift.</li>
      <li>The $2 brand from the department store works better, and that&#x27;s saying something.</li>
      <li>and I think its ok</li>
      <li>I should know better than to purchase a name brand makeup online, but this product seemed, and looked legit.</li>

      <li>Jemma Kidd I-Tech Liquid Liner - available at Target and Amazon</li>
      <li>The eye liner gel goes on smooth with the Mac&#x27;s angle brush and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>This gel eyeliner is practical, small and best of all it does not smear; it is what every women dreams of.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried similar products and the results weren&#x27;t as good as this.</li>
      <li>unlike many reviews have stated because I&#x27;ve bought the real thing in a store before and</li>
      <li>Great product, can&#x27;t see myself buying any other product for eye liner!</li>
      <li>I love the color the gel glides on smooth, the color lasts a long time, easy to remove, I recomment to everyone.</li>
      <li>It washes off easily when I am ready to remove it.  </li>
      <li>But its worth the money.</li>
      <li>I added some contact solution (from a mac rep&#x27;s suggestion) and it made it more of a water like fluid-line leaving it more gray than black.</li>
      <li>This is amazing eyeliner and my second favorite overall</li>
      <li>It is exactly as I bought it</li>
      <li>I used it for the first time</li>
      <li>Save your money and visit the real thing not imposters like this seller!  </li>
      <li>First one was the MAC slanted brush.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what i was looking for.</li>
      <li>It stays in place all day and you can make so many different looks with it!</li>
      <li>Many of these third party sells counterfeit brands and the ones that are real can be out of date.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m positive</li>
      <li>The title pretty much says it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The M.A.C Cosmetics website sells this exact (3g, 0.1oz) product for $15.00, and you KNOW you&#x27;re getting the real thing.</li>
      <li>However, it goes on easily and will last all day with nary a smudge.[[ASIN:</li>
      <li>The heat is frequently on very high and classroom teachers don&#x27;t have control over the room&#x27;s temperature.</li>
      <li>I really liked it, my eyes were a little itchy all day.</li>
      <li>I have bought REAL Mac fliud line before and it is nothing like this.</li>
      <li>and I could&#x27;ve bought the real item.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I really like this gel pot.</li>
      <li>You can verify what the real product looks like on the MAC site and it is not what you get .&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m scared to use the product because I know it isn&#x27;t real by the packaging,real mac has a sticker on the box</li>
      <li>The eyeliner doesn&#x27;t leak out of your eyes (that much) by the end of a work day.</li>
      <li>with the money u spend just get the real one -_-  </li>
      <li>Going back to my old favorite - don&#x27;t know why I strayed from something I already knew works.  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s easy to use, and stays on for a long time.</li>
      <li>At the end of the day the way it does the line is perfect because it is not too black or too thick.</li>
      <li>I was very happy with that because I have a hard time getting an eyeliner that does not rub off after a few hours.</li>
      <li>Now with MAC I spend about forty dollars or less every three months, this is definitely a better deal than the others.</li>
      <li>When I bought it, I compared it to the real one I had bought from MAC, and everything looked exactly the same.  </li>
      <li>I love the fact that it lasts a long time even with daily use.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product because I used to use both pencil and liquid eyeliners from NYC, Clinique and other brands that will not last the whole day</li>
      <li>Forget the product, the packaging was not even the same as real Mac Gel liner!</li>
      <li>The one I have looks exactly like the one in this picture, not the one on the actual MAC website.</li>
      <li>these are the exact same.</li>
      <li>(My holy grail is Bobbi Brown)but order from MAC or get from a trusted place like Macy&#x27;s to make sure it&#x27;s the real product and not some fake copy and also that it is still fresh.</li>
      <li>The only tricky part is teaching yourself how to keep your hand steady enough for a straight line, but after the first week I was almost a</li>
      <li>I washed my face 3 hours ago put cucumbers on my eyes and they are still red and irritated but a little better.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>it is not easy to draw a precise line with ANY brush.  </li>
      <li>I was really excited about this product, but after a few times using it</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even know why these resellers are trying to charge such high prices, GAH.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for cheap fake MAC makeup that won&#x27;t last then I would purchase it, otherwise it is just worth it to pay the few extra dollars for a product that will last you a year or more and not dry up or look funny.</li>
      <li>I usually get the cheap stuff from walmart and make it work.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My order has received perfectly on time. This is the second time I bought the same item over amazon. The same item on MAC&#x27;s official website is $16 [...] SO I dont think that this item is a fake one as some people said while leaving a poor star and review about this item. I would definitely recomment it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner it stays on great and lasts all day long no smell as well.</li>
    <li> with the money u spend just get the real one -_-  this is not real mac nor should be it advertised as it.</li>
    <li> LLEGO A VENEZUELA EN PERFECTAS CONDICIONES. LO RECOMIENDO. SIN SUDA VOLVERE A COMPRARLO. NO SE CORRE Y DURA TODO EL DIA.</li>
    <li> i buy this to wife and is not orignal MAC !!!!</li>
    <li> This is a horrible version of the real thing.  The brush it came with literally fell apart when I opened the box.  Save your money and visit the real thing not imposters like this seller!  I&#x27;m scared to use the product because I know it isn&#x27;t real by the packaging,real mac has a sticker on the box so u know the name of the color of your product not a krazy number like this wack imposter. If you don&#x27;t mind the possibility of getting an unknown product and using it on your delicate face stay far away from MAC on Amazon.  P.S. why isn&#x27;t there an option to rate this seller with no stars</li>
    <li> Amazing gel eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I should know better than to purchase a name brand makeup online, but this product seemed, and looked legit. When I bought it, I compared it to the real one I had bought from MAC, and everything looked exactly the same.  But when using it, you could tell it wasn&#x27;t like the normal fluid line eyeliner from MAC, and it also dried out quick, and seemed to ball up.  I would not recommend this product!  If you are looking for cheap fake MAC makeup that won&#x27;t last then I would purchase it, otherwise it is just worth it to pay the few extra dollars for a product that will last you a year or more and not dry up or look funny.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get this liner at all...unless you have the manual artistry of Leonardo Da Vinci it is IMPOSSIBLE to get a good, clean, straight line - and I bought the expensive MAC brush to go with it.  I thought with practice I would get the hang of it but it is just too awkward to apply.  I bought it because I have oily skin - the type make-up melts off of - and I had read that gel liners are the best for long smudge-proof wear.  Going back to my old favorite - don&#x27;t know why I strayed from something I already knew works.  Jemma Kidd I-Tech Liquid Liner - available at Target and Amazon; not cheap and somewhat limited palette.  However, it goes on easily and will last all day with nary a smudge.[[ASIN:B001BO204S JK Jemma Kidd I-Tech Liquid Eyeliner - Covert]]</li>
    <li> This is a product review, no reference to the seller. I really like this gel pot. It can be tricky to apply, but once in place it stays in place. I love most MAC products.</li>
    <li> Arrived in 3 days even after coming from across the country! MAC is my favorite brand. I&#x27;m positive it&#x27;s authentic MAC eyeliner unlike many reviews have stated because I&#x27;ve bought the real thing in a store before and these are the exact same. Will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> I got the best make up solution, stress free!!! The black gel eyeliner from MAC is the women&#x27;s best friend.This gel eyeliner is practical, small and best of all it does not smear; it is what every women dreams of.  I absolutely love this product because I used to use both pencil and liquid eyeliners from NYC, Clinique and other brands that will not last the whole day and I will always have to be reapplying throughout the day. I hate it doing it, until one day my friend bought gel eyeliner from MAC and she told me how good it was so I went out and tried it.The eyeliner is great; though it has its downfall; it is expensive compare to other brands. However, when I used my other eyeliners I spent up to thirty dollars monthly because they broke, ran out or I just did not like them. Now with MAC I spend about forty dollars or less every three months, this is definitely a better deal than the others. Also at first it is not easy applying it, but as long as you try in front of a mirror a couple times you will get use to it. At the end of the day the way it does the line is perfect because it is not too black or too thick. So if you are tired of having bad make up days, go and buy some MAC!</li>
    <li> The M.A.C Cosmetics website sells this exact (3g, 0.1oz) product for $15.00, and you KNOW you&#x27;re getting the real thing. Don&#x27;t pay more!!!! I don&#x27;t even know why these resellers are trying to charge such high prices, GAH.</li>
    <li> Stay away!!! Forget the product, the packaging was not even the same as real Mac Gel liner! 6 more dollars and I could&#x27;ve bought the real item. What a waste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this pot since March 2011.  I love the fact that it lasts a long time even with daily use.  I don&#x27;t pile on makeup maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s lasted so long.  However, I have to agree with someone&#x27;s previous review- it is not easy to draw a precise line with ANY brush.  I&#x27;ve switched brushes three times.  First one was the MAC slanted brush.  Second one was something I got from Sephora but it was about $20.  Third one is a $14 ULTRA brush.  Even when brand new, the line is never perfect.  And I have had about 8 months of practice.  I&#x27;m only using it because it seems a waste to not use it.  I&#x27;ve not had many complaints about MAC products so I trust their quality but for eyeliner I might go for another brand now.</li>
    <li> Nothing &#x27;fluid&amp;#34; about this. Arrived with a thick, dried out texture. Impossible to get a good line with it. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> It is of high quality and if you want to jazz up your eyes, with the look of a professional make up artist, you cannot go wrong with this Mac product.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product and the seller finest Kmalk shipping has a very fast and Recommend product purchase is an excellent price and it does use Ptwhit eye area&lt;br /&gt;Very Excellent</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner.  The eye liner gel goes on smooth with the Mac&#x27;s angle brush and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Have not tried on it but my daughter has one too. She is happy with it and I think its ok</li>
    <li> Awesome product!  Glides on easily and stays all day no matter what.  Come off easily with eye makeup remover.  The little jar lasts and lasts.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t stick as well as usual. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and this jar needs to be applied carefully or it smears and doesn&#x27;t cover..</li>
    <li> Product looks completely different from the picture. It comes in a square pot when the picture shows a round one. I have bought REAL Mac fliud line before and it is nothing like this. I tried a little out on my waterline using the included brush and it hardy shows up!</li>
    <li> I love the color the gel glides on smooth, the color lasts a long time, easy to remove, I recomment to everyone.</li>
    <li> BEST GEL EYELINER I HAVE FOUND</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eyeliner, it was given to me as a gift. I would never pay 15 or 20 bucks for an eyeliner so I will probably not get another one...unless it&#x27;s a gift. But if you are into expensive brands you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This eye liner is so great!! It goes on easily and stays put all day - even until the next morning if I happen to be too tired to wash it off at night.  It washes off easily when I am ready to remove it.  The color is beautiful!</li>
    <li> This gel liner goes on so smooth it feels luxurious! I love MAC products!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner! I work an average of 12 hours a day through the week and all of the other pencil eyeliners I have tried didn&#x27;t make the cut! My friend is a hair stylist and recommended this product to me and I have never looked back! It stays in place all day and you can make so many different looks with it! The only tricky part is teaching yourself how to keep your hand steady enough for a straight line, but after the first week I was almost a pro! Great product, can&#x27;t see myself buying any other product for eye liner!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this eyeliner for years and have always LOVED it.  Unfortunately, my recent purchase of it came to me old, dry and unusable.  I will never purchase this from Amazon again as I wasted the money and my time.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this product, but after a few times using it I realized that it was showing up on my face and not staying on my eyes!  Won&#x27;t be getting this again.</li>
    <li> Basically the title says it all folks. This is amazing eyeliner and my second favorite overall (My holy grail is Bobbi Brown)but order from MAC or get from a trusted place like Macy&#x27;s to make sure it&#x27;s the real product and not some fake copy and also that it is still fresh. Many of these third party sells counterfeit brands and the ones that are real can be out of date. Do not risk it.</li>
    <li> The best eye liner that I had used.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It is exactly as I bought it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a kindergarten teacher, so I&#x27;m very active and don&#x27;t have time to touch-up my make-up during the work day. The heat is frequently on very high and classroom teachers don&#x27;t have control over the room&#x27;s temperature. The excessive heat causes my drug-store brand eyeliner to smudge and eventually rub-off by the time my students are dismissed at the end of the school day. The MAC Fluidline Eye Liner is the ONLY product that stays in tact through excessive heat and exercise. LOVE this eyeliner! Thank you, MAC!</li>
    <li> It is awesome! It&#x27;s very dark just the way I like it but you need to make sure you have a good brush to put it on with or else you&#x27;ll be wiping off more than u put on.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on one night to go to the club. Came home and woke up with it still in perfect condition. I was very happy with that because I have a hard time getting an eyeliner that does not rub off after a few hours.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t arraive to me !!!!! i have problems . How can i call u to see my problem ?</li>
    <li> Buyer beware. This is not the same as what you would purchase at the Mac department in Macys. It is a small sample size container with a small amount of liner in it. This is overpriced and misleading.</li>
    <li> After reading some other reviews I found some people saying this is not the real thing. IDK I got this as a gift and thought cool expensive makeup I usually get the cheap stuff from walmart and make it work. The one I have looks exactly like the one in this picture, not the one on the actual MAC website. I used it for the first time yesterday, it went on great and looked good I really liked it, my eyes were a little itchy all day. Then this morning I woke up and under my eyes was puffy, I blew it off as I didn&#x27;t sleep well and did my make up this morning, by this afternoon my eyes were terribly puffy and red and itchy( no I wasn&#x27;t rubbing my eyes) I washed my face 3 hours ago put cucumbers on my eyes and they are still red and irritated but a little better. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and I have never had this problem before trying this product.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner does a great job of making very even, perfect lines with the right brush. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is if you have sensitive eyes, it may be harsh. I try not to use it everyday because sometimes my eyes become a bit sore in the morning. But it&#x27;s easy to use, and stays on for a long time. The texture of the gel is creamy and thick. I usually have to dip my eyeliner brush a few times for each eye.</li>
    <li> the best eye liner ever!!!</li>
    <li> Love it.  I previously used the MAC Prowear gel pencil and hated how it would smear.  This Fluidline Gel Liner is awesome!  It stays in place all day, doesnt irrritate my eyes, and NEVER smears.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed at this purchase. A little goes a long way leaving the fluid-line usable for a while. After three months of use and making sure I kept the lid on tight, it still dried up :( I added some contact solution (from a mac rep&#x27;s suggestion) and it made it more of a water like fluid-line leaving it more gray than black. All I can say is I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> The title pretty much says it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is hard to apply, it runs, it smudges easily, and it does not have even color application.  The $2 brand from the department store works better, and that&#x27;s saying something.</li>
    <li> i love using this product</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is awesome, you need to buy the mac eye liner brush to use it. But its worth the money. The eyeliner doesn&#x27;t leak out of your eyes (that much) by the end of a work day. I&#x27;ve tried similar products and the results weren&#x27;t as good as this. The eye liner gets dry if you leave the cap open, so always close the cap immediately after use.</li>
    <li> This is the only eyeliner I will use, even for brows</li>
    <li> The product that arrives when purchasing from this listing is not real MAC product. It is counterfeit! I would hesitate to use it not knowing what I was truly using. You can verify what the real product looks like on the MAC site and it is not what you get .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can google \\&quot;fake MAC gel liner\\&quot; and will see examples of counterfeit MAC. I ended up with the square package with the brush.... a fake!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Fast shipping and good price!</li>
    <li> really goes on nice, and did not irritate my eyes..</li>
