### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works well and smells great!!</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t be without this product for the best results money can buy.</li>
      <li>This is a great value!  </li>
      <li>but the product works great!</li>
      <li>Great price.  </li>
      <li>Nail Remover works great with some cotton balls and foil to remove gelish polish.</li>
      <li>Great for all soak off gel polish</li>
      <li>(in fact you can feel it get really warm in there!).  </li>
      <li>This remover is amazing.  </li>
      <li>I do my own gel manicures at home.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m kind of upset</li>
      <li>I think if it was a gallon I would have given it more stars.</li>
      <li>I love this remover</li>
      <li>so glad i got a refill now...</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>, I guess i thought i was getting more for my money</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Love the gelish products</li>
      <li>Very quick shipment.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had manicurists comment at how strong my nails are after they have taken the polish off.  </li>
      <li>I thought the bottle would be bigger but its still a great product and a better price than you can find in stores, plus its shipped to your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gelish makes me really happy, I&#x27;ve always had brittle easily broken nails and since I&#x27;ve started using Gelish polishes my nails have gotten significantly stronger!</li>
      <li>I will use this formula from now on; it was so worth the money because it saved my nails AND my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I do not think it is worth what I paid for it</li>
      <li>and I had to try it right away.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It takes 20-45 minutes to get all the polish off, and that&#x27;s even with sanding off the first layer before soaking and chipping off polish periodically as it soaks.  </li>
      <li>This is really good,the most I like is not dry you nails at all.</li>
      <li>So happy i got this because my small bottle was running out!</li>
      <li>The reason for the 4 stars is due the lid not quite fitting right.  </li>
      <li>SO, I needed this large bottle of remover.  </li>
      <li>Just received my product and for the price i thought it would be bigger and a tad bit more full but at least it was wrap with plastic on top so their would be no spills on its way to me.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I don&#x27;t need as much as I use, but anytime I remove my Gelish polish, I use a LOT of remover on the cotton ball.  </li>
      <li>and I really had to file the balance of the gel off my nails as it didn&#x27;t quite do the job</li>
      <li>I go through this stuff fast because it evaporates if not sealed well.</li>
      <li>She loves it and its so much cheaper than going to the salon.</li>
      <li>After only 15 minutes of soaking some of the polish on my finger nails had come COMPLETELY off without me touching my nail with a tool.  </li>
      <li>This is worth the money to me because I only use it two times a month.</li>
      <li>I use it to soak off the gelish Polish and it works fast and does not dry out my nails or skin .</li>
      <li>i used to spend 45 minutes with my nails wrapped up soaking off the gel polish i used with this stuff and the darn polish still wouldn&#x27;t come completely off.  </li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my cuticles as much with the added vitamins.</li>

    <li> I love this remover I use it to soak off the gelish Polish and it works fast and does not dry out my nails or skin .</li>
    <li> Works well and smells great!! I hate the smell of standard nail remover. This is worth the money to me because I only use it two times a month.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try it to take off the gel polish...it took too long and I really had to file the balance of the gel off my nails as it didn&#x27;t quite do the job</li>
    <li> This is really good,the most I like is not dry you nails at all.</li>
    <li> I thought the bottle would be bigger but its still a great product and a better price than you can find in stores, plus its shipped to your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gelish makes me really happy, I&#x27;ve always had brittle easily broken nails and since I&#x27;ve started using Gelish polishes my nails have gotten significantly stronger!</li>
    <li> it leaked when arrived to me. but not a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using 100% acetone to soak off my gel polish for months now, and I&#x27;ve been ruining my nails.  It takes 20-45 minutes to get all the polish off, and that&#x27;s even with sanding off the first layer before soaking and chipping off polish periodically as it soaks.  The worst part was this process always took some of the top layers of my nail with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gelish soak off formula arrived last night and I had to try it right away.  After only 15 minutes of soaking some of the polish on my finger nails had come COMPLETELY off without me touching my nail with a tool.  I will use this formula from now on; it was so worth the money because it saved my nails AND my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Another trick I picked up for speeding the time it takes to soak off is to put your hands in plastic baggies AFTER you wrap your nails/finger tips in foil.  It speeds up the soak off process (in fact you can feel it get really warm in there!).  I&#x27;ve had manicurists comment at how strong my nails are after they have taken the polish off.  Yep!  NO damage here, ladies!  :)</li>
    <li> Love the gelish products</li>
    <li> This remover is amazing.  Works on all of my gel polishes.  Definitely worth buying the bigger jug as it is cheaper than constantly buying multiple small bottles!</li>
    <li> picture look like it would be like a gallon size but its much smaller than that, I guess i thought i was getting more for my money but the product works great!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I do my own gel manicures at home. I go through this stuff fast because it evaporates if not sealed well. There is plenty in the bottle to last me a while. I do notice this takes of the Gelish polish easier than plain Acetone and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my cuticles as much with the added vitamins.</li>
    <li> I know the description said it was a liter but for some reason I pictured this item being a lot bigger. I do not think it is worth what I paid for it especially sense it&#x27;s just like nail polish remover which I can buy at the dollar store for way less. I think if it was a gallon I would have given it more stars.</li>
    <li> This is a great value!  I don&#x27;t know if I don&#x27;t need as much as I use, but anytime I remove my Gelish polish, I use a LOT of remover on the cotton ball.  SO, I needed this large bottle of remover.  The reason for the 4 stars is due the lid not quite fitting right.  It could just be the bottle I have though.</li>
    <li> Just received my product and for the price i thought it would be bigger and a tad bit more full but at least it was wrap with plastic on top so their would be no spills on its way to me.When I use it I be back to answer of it work well.</li>
    <li> Great for all soak off gel polish</li>
    <li> This is a repeat purchase. Wouldn&#x27;t be without this product for the best results money can buy.</li>
    <li> So happy i got this because my small bottle was running out! im so glad i got a refill now...</li>
    <li> I bought the Gelish kit for my mom. She loves it and its so much cheaper than going to the salon. Nail Remover works great with some cotton balls and foil to remove gelish polish.</li>
    <li> The jar had a hole in it and leaked had to pour it in to another jar.</li>
    <li> Very quick shipment. Great price.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> i used to spend 45 minutes with my nails wrapped up soaking off the gel polish i used with this stuff and the darn polish still wouldn&#x27;t come completely off.  i have discovered that if you get a coarse grain nail file and just sand the stuff off it&#x27;s much quicker and less annoying.  i&#x27;m kind of upset i bought a gallon of the the stuff that i will probably never use.</li>
