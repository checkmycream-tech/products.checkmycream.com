      <li>My recipient said it was &amp;#34;exactly&amp;#34; what she wanted and was so happy to get it.</li>

      <li>I love this mirror!</li>
      <li>On the right surface, this is a great product.</li>
      <li>it is ok, could be taller, it has the magnification that  is needed, easy to take with you on a trip</li>
      <li>to make sure it&#x27;s secure.  </li>
      <li>About a year later, my husband found this on Amazon and I am one happy camper.  </li>
      <li>This mirror is a very effective magnifier, but keep in mind that the suction cups only work on a perfectly smooth surface.  </li>
      <li>Good enough construction; sturdy; lightweight; opaque plastic is kinda cool; I haven&#x27;t used the suction cup thingy</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without this mirror!!!  </li>
      <li>Otherwise this is exactly what was promised.</li>

<li> don&#x27;t work, the magnification is poor quality, the gooseneck is inferior quality...and so forth.  </li>

    <li> Light enough to travel</li>
    <li> Bigger than thought, returned!</li>
    <li> Does the job exactly as intended. The suction cups work very well - it has never fallen off. Quality is good.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this mirror to anyone who has poor or failing eye-sight.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this mirror for years and if I did not have it, it would be more&lt;br /&gt;difficult for me to apply makeup, pluck eyebrows, etc.  I keep mine attached to&lt;br /&gt;the bathroom mirror as this works best for me and I have never had the suction&lt;br /&gt;cups loosen or the mirror fall off.  I do from time to time press on the base of the&lt;br /&gt;mirror to make sure it&#x27;s secure.  The only drawback I see with this mirror  is the&lt;br /&gt;neck.  If adjusted too often it weakens and will not hold its position.  When that&lt;br /&gt;happens I buy another mirror.  This has only happened twice since I started using&lt;br /&gt;this mirror about ten years ago.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I have 3 of these now for use at home, at cottage and for travel - can bend enough to pack in suitcase padded by clothing - have never used the suction cups but like the bendable neck - great buy for the price with no distortion.</li>
    <li> I had this mirror before and it accidentally got broken.  Couldn&#x27;t go a day without it. So glad to find the exact same mirror on Amazon. Perfect for applying make up in the morning.  I love this mirror!</li>

    <li> I love this mirror, except that one of the two I bought is defective in that the gooseneck turns around (not supposed to) and is not properly connected to the base. So there is no way to keep it from falling downward and in place.</li>
    <li> When you look at yourself in the mirror, your face looks deformed, the quality of the mirror is bad, a high price for cheap quality, unfortunately, I cannot return it because I placed the order to be shipped to USA and someone brought it for me to South America.</li>
    <li> I thought it would have a regular mirror on the reverse of the magnifying one, the suction cups included to attache it to the bathroom mirror don&#x27;t work, the magnification is poor quality, the gooseneck is inferior quality...and so forth.  Very bad quality in every way. I would like my money back.</li>
    <li> This magnifying mirror was a good buy for the money and just what I hoped for.  7x magnification is the perfect level of magnification for putting on make-up.  The suction cups work well.</li>
    <li> This mirror is perfect for putting on eye makeup.  If installed properly with the suction cups, it will not fall down.</li>
    <li> it is ok, could be taller, it has the magnification that  is needed, easy to take with you on a trip</li>
    <li> This is a terrific mirror for travel and aging eyes!  Easy to mount on another mirror or flat surface, and the goose neck allow adjustment for any height or angle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very dissatisfied with this mirror yes i knew it was magnified buy this is too much. I brought this to see the back of my head to curl it but you can&#x27;t see it unless you hang the mirror on the other side of the room. i&#x27;m returning this &amp; don&#x27;t advise anyone to buy this mirror .</li>
    <li> I had a very similar mirror for 15 years that required replacement.  I looked all over the net to find another one without success.  About a year later, my husband found this on Amazon and I am one happy camper.  This is a requirement for make-up application.  I love it!  (Mine goes on the large mirror in my bathroom and extends out over the marble counter.  Couldn&#x27;t be easier.)</li>
    <li> Was a gift.  My recipient said it was &amp;#34;exactly&amp;#34; what she wanted and was so happy to get it.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this mirror!!!  I would recommend it for everyone who wants to look the best they possibly can, especially for those who need a higher magnification than the usual 5x.</li>
    <li> It was just what I thought it would be. It helps me to see better,.since I have bad eye sight problems.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to any one struggling with eye sight problems.</li>
    <li> I really like the flexibility of this mirror - and it looks neat in our bathroom - its just the right size.</li>
    <li> Bought for wife and she loves it for make up.</li>
    <li> This mirror is a very effective magnifier, but keep in mind that the suction cups only work on a perfectly smooth surface.  The mirror is not free-standing, as the base is too lightweight in comparison with the top portion and it tends to fall over unless secured by the suction cups.  On the right surface, this is a great product.</li>
