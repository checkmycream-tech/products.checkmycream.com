      <li>I am on my second jar and very pleased.</li>
      <li>My new favorite skin line.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin Brighter and feels soft love this product</li>
      <li>I am in my middle years of life and have tried many moisturizers for my face, originally I had ordered this from Origins but found it cheaper on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Been using this product now for 2 months - i have noticed that my eyes feel a bit &amp;#34;brighter and more awake&amp;#34; in the mornings and have noticed the dark circles diminish a bit, but not as much as I like - hopefully more use will</li>
      <li>I used the Perfect World over winter (very dry and low temperatures where I live -</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;m not breaking out  from it, so a huge plus for me.  </li>
      <li>Positively adore this moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>So that really bothered me.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed much of an awakening sensation with the morning application.</li>
      <li>It really moistrizes my face and it doesn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>Really didn&#x27;t see any difference in my complexion though.</li>
      <li>so it does go a bit fast.</li>
      <li>Also used Origins face wash and drink it up mask during past few months - I&#x27;m really a fan of this brand by now, perfect price to quality ratio, will stick with it for long!</li>

      <li>It makes my face feel alive in the morning.</li>
      <li>The smell is a little overly sweet-citrusy and takes some getting used to, but overall I really like how smoothly this goes on and absorbs, leaving my face silky and not greasy, a great base for makeup.  </li>
      <li>it just dried too quickly for me.</li>

    <li> This is my absolute favorite moisturizer and it is worth every penny! It smells delicious, and leaves your face so smooth. It&#x27;s not oily and it is light and refreshing. This is simply an amazing product and I will continue to buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin Brighter and feels soft love this product</li>
    <li> My new favorite skin line. Feels great on my face in the morning. Absorbs quickly before putting on makeup.</li>
    <li> This product smells good but did not work on my face . May work different for others the consistency of this product was not very thick felt like I had to reapply it or it just dried too quickly for me.</li>
    <li> I love it! This is the second time I bought it. It is not oily. Moreover, after I used it, I feel my face is very soft. I really love it, and I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great! Feels good on your skin and makes it very dewy looking when you wake up in the morning.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good words about this moisturizer! The previous one I used was Perfect World by Origins, and that one is also excellent though a little bit heavier but still super absorbent and leaves your skin very fresh and awakened. I used the Perfect World over winter (very dry and low temperatures where I live - so it&#x27;s been life saving for my skin!) and I switched to ginzing for spring /summer since its lighter but still provides a boost of soothing moisture to my skin. Also used Origins face wash and drink it up mask during past few months - I&#x27;m really a fan of this brand by now, perfect price to quality ratio, will stick with it for long!</li>
    <li> Great Moisturizer for both day and night! I have oily/sensitive skin and it does not clog my pores, nor does it leave me feeling greasy. It also smells just like oranges. :)</li>
    <li> Been using this product now for 2 months - i have noticed that my eyes feel a bit &amp;#34;brighter and more awake&amp;#34; in the mornings and have noticed the dark circles diminish a bit, but not as much as I like - hopefully more use will help!&lt;br /&gt;I put it on every morning and every night so it does go a bit fast.</li>
    <li> Best smelling moisturizer on the market.  My skin runs dry and I&#x27;m allergic to about everything it seems.  So far, I&#x27;m not breaking out  from it, so a huge plus for me.  I think time will tell if it actually shows a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer. Haven&#x27;t noticed much of an awakening sensation with the morning application. Noticed a little help healing old marks from prior blemishes.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with moisturizer...:(&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use the rest of the product but won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>

    <li> The smell is so uplifting! I cannot wake up without putting this on my face.</li>
    <li> Love this product. BUT it was not sealed at all.. The box wasn&#x27;t sealed nor was the product itself.. So that really bothered me.</li>
    <li> To those of you who don&#x27;t know, the same size of moisturizer is being sold at the actual origins store for about $26.50. If it&#x27;s close to you at all or you&#x27;re able to do it online, I would recommend that :) just a helpful tip</li>
    <li> Save your money and just drink water.  This product is a complete waste of money, like so many others out there.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried overcommitted</li>
    <li> I am in my middle years of life and have tried many moisturizers for my face, originally I had ordered this from Origins but found it cheaper on Amazon. It smells wonderful and works  great for your skin.</li>

    <li> Very creamy and feels good on the skin. Has an orange zest fragrance. Smells great! Skin does feel softer, less dry.</li>
    <li> I saw rave reviews of this moisturizer on Amazon and Birch Box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily, sensitive skin and have seen great improvement in my moody skin and keeping my make up stationary throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually makes my skin feel fresh and awake in the morning, which sounds silly but there is no better way to describe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was cute, they wrapped it in wrapping paper which was a treat!</li>
    <li> Not for senstive skin</li>
    <li> Big fan of their GenZing collection. I use the face wash as well as the lotion and they work great. A little on the expensive side but a little goes a long way with this lotion.</li>
    <li> it was ok..for the price.&lt;br /&gt;it does not make your sick feel oily&lt;br /&gt;that what i like about it.&lt;br /&gt;so it &#x27;s ok</li>
