      <li>Love, Love, Love this flat iron.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t really get as hot as I would like it to be but for the most part it works ok.</li>

      <li>Good travel flat iron.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s product quality or the fact that I had to take smaller hanks of hair to properly flatten, but it worked great!</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly.</li>
      <li>I have tried it a couple of time and it heats quickly.  </li>
      <li>Extremely small, but ideal for bangs.</li>

      <li>Fast and easy transaction.  </li>
      <li>Well this one gets plenty hot!  </li>
      <li>Works fine, doesn&#x27;t do a whole bunch of hair at one time, but I didn&#x27;t need it to do that.  </li>
      <li>Great little straightener.</li>
      <li>Better for short hair because of the size, but it is fine for my medium length hair -</li>
      <li>The size is good for travel, but I prefer 1&amp;#34; wide because it takes longer to straighten with this one.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t worth the space it saves...</li>
      <li>Worked very well and doesn&#x27;t take up much room as it is used mostly on motorcycle trips.</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>this straightener was just right for my trip to Europe.</li>
      <li>Small but great for travel</li>
      <li>spoiled by my full size straightener, this one was pretty wimpy, but doesn&#x27;t take up much space in a suitcase</li>
      <li>Got hot</li>
      <li>Its exactly what I was looked for and needed.  </li>
      <li>Very portable!</li>
      <li>My first straightener.</li>
      <li>There is one setting...very hot...</li>
      <li>Although small, it&#x27;s perfect for short hair.</li>
      <li>I have  a lot of hair and it&#x27;s past my shoulders, so this was not really the best for my hair needs, but it heats up quickly and works well.</li>
      <li>Most dual-voltage irons are full-size, and take up too much room &amp; weight if flying internationally.</li>
      <li>On the plus side, they do seem to get hot pretty fast.</li>
      <li>Perhaps if you only wanted to use this on your bangs, it&#x27;d be fine.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Just what I needed for travel.  Works fine, doesn&#x27;t do a whole bunch of hair at one time, but I didn&#x27;t need it to do that.  Love that it will not take up a bunch of space in my suitcase.</li>
    <li> WORKED WELL FOR TRAVEL</li>
    <li> This little flat iron is great.  Nice and compact so it&#x27;s perfect for home or travel.</li>
    <li> This product does straighten your hair but it is VERY small.  You can only do small sections of you hair.  It is good for travel.  When I don&#x27;t need it for travel, I keep it in work for touch ups.</li>
    <li> Great little straightener. I use it curl my hair. It&#x27;s about 3 inches long (yes, I&#x27;m a guy that uses a straightener) and it does the job perfectly</li>
    <li> This broke after 6 months. It just stopped turning on. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Perfect size, cute and functional storage sleeve, and product worked just like it should.</li>
    <li> spoiled by my full size straightener, this one was pretty wimpy, but doesn&#x27;t take up much space in a suitcase</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Travel size..would take forever to straighten any substantial amount of hair..was not expecting it to be this small</li>
    <li> My second one. Travels great, works fast, and comes with heat proof sleeve, which is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I have a short (pixie) cut and this works perfect!</li>
    <li> I love this!  I have short hair (1-2 inches) and this is perfect.  Its exactly what I was looked for and needed.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> no voltage switch, it auto changes to the voltage of your location. Worked great in Poland, Hungary and Czech Republic. So compact, it was easy to pack.</li>
    <li> Perfect for just what I needed - straightening my bangs. Heats up quickly and also comes with an insulated case which is convenient since there&#x27;s no waiting for cool down before you put it away.</li>
    <li> Works great on the go and for bangs.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and the metal plates aren&#x27;t big enough to really fix hair at all. Perhaps if you only wanted to use this on your bangs, it&#x27;d be fine. Otherwise, just take your regular size straightener with you. This isn&#x27;t worth the space it saves... If anything, it&#x27;s a complete waste of space since I didn&#x27;t wind up using it at all.</li>
    <li> Waited 30 minutes to warm up and it never got hot enough to straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> It is very small like the other reviews say.&lt;br /&gt;I will see how it does on my upcoming cruise.</li>
    <li> Got this for a backpacking trip through Japan, totally works on my fine hair. I use it mostly to straighten my ends as they can flip in weird directions when my hair air dries. I got the 1 1/4&amp;#34; curling iron in the same size by conair. I found that one to work better than the straightener and used it more.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife to use on our vacation in Australia and New Zealand.  It is dual voltage and tiny (think fits in a purse tiny).  She hooked it up to an outlet adapter (not voltage converter!) and it worked as expected.  She was a happy camper to be able to use her straightener on vacation.</li>
    <li> Wish it was a little bit bigger because I have a lot of hair,  But it packed small and worked great.  Helped with my unruly hair on a trip to Spain.  Great price too.</li>
    <li> Love it. Very small, but I only need it for bangs. Heats quickly, works great. Come with zebra print case too.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my 62-year-old mom, and she loves it. I had to show her how to curl her short hair with it. She took it to Europe and it worked great. She likes it better than her curling iron because there is less risk of burning herself while styling her short hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect for traveling and small touch ups at home! Used it for three weeks in Italy and had no problems! Heats up fast and the traveling pouch it comes with is fantastic for keeping the cord and everything together! Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this for my trip to Spain based upon other reviews. When it arrived I was amazed how small it was. I took it with me this past weekend out of town to try it out and thank goodness I wasn&#x27;t doing anything other than skiing because my hair looked awful! It doesn&#x27;t get very hot and I felt like it was ripping my hair out. I have a textured chin length cut that is fairly straight with a very slight wave and it did nothing for my hair other than make it flat and wispy. I threw out the packaging upon arrival (silly me) so rather than try to return it I left it in the trash at our hotel this weekend.</li>
    <li> This straightener works well for international travel and even though the blades are shorter than the one I use at home, it is great for taming my hair in humid climates.</li>
    <li> Yes, for my wife and her short hair, this is exactly what she wanted, and needed to use in finishing her hair in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;thx</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Had seen comment about this unit not getting hot enough but I thought I&#x27;d try it anyway.  Well this one gets plenty hot!  And it heats up really fast too.  Thanks for great service and a great product.</li>
    <li> I took this to Europe and Great Britain this spring, along with adaptors, and it worked great.  It&#x27;s small, compact and lightweight. There is one setting...very hot...so care must be taken to lay it on a heatproof surface while using and after unplugging.  It will definitely go with me on the next international trip.</li>
    <li> Dual voltage was perfect for travel abroad. Got hot and I like the heat resistant pouch it comes with. The size is good for travel, but I prefer 1&amp;#34; wide because it takes longer to straighten with this one. Overall I was happy with this product.</li>
    <li> this straightener was just right for my trip to Europe. Very small, lightweight, worked great! All I need to straighten is my bangs, so the small size was exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> This product works okay but I I think if I were to have really curly hair and I would try to straighten it it wouldn&#x27;t really work. it doesn&#x27;t really get as hot as I would like it to be but for the most part it works ok.</li>
    <li> This item shipped super fast which was wonderful but its just ok.  It is small which is what I was looking for but it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.  I have thick wavy hair and its going to be a chore to straighten my hair.  Not sure that I will be taking it with me on my trip</li>
    <li> Had one of these before but could not find another one in the store but found it on Amazon, great for travel or just a quick curl for the beach wave look.</li>
    <li> Small and easy to use</li>
    <li> this is shorter and thinner than i expected which made me think that it wouldn&#x27;t work well/it would take a lot of time to get my hair done, but suprisingly it works really good. it gets hot really fast (1-3min to get to its hottest state) and it&#x27;s perfect for traveling cause of the size. i&#x27;m just in qualms about how long the lifespan of this product. it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t seem too sturdy and it feels like it could break easily.</li>
    <li> Although small, it&#x27;s perfect for short hair. I use it for travel and at home.</li>
    <li> This straighner is the perfect size for any suitcase or bag. It heats very quickly and straighten your hair beautifully.</li>
    <li> Bought this for someone taking a trip and it worked great for them. Very portable!</li>
    <li> My first straightener. So far, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> Way too small! Took forever to do whole head.</li>
    <li> works really well.  Small but great for travel</li>
    <li> Good travel flat iron.</li>
    <li> These work great and do what you want them too.  Very compact, heat up fast, and work great for your BEARD!</li>
    <li> This straightener is great, works very well and travels well.  It also comes with a pouch, which was a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> Extremely small, but ideal for bangs. You couldn&#x27;t possibly use these to straighten and style your whole head, especially if you have long thick hair. On the plus side, they do seem to get hot pretty fast. I guess I&#x27;ll keep them.</li>
    <li> A must have for me.  This is my second one.  The first one only lasted one year, but it is something I will continue to reorder if this one stops working.</li>
    <li> It hangs up on my hair.  I have a full size flat iron with titanium that does not pull at all.  Not sure if it is the ceramic or ??</li>
    <li> This was a purchase for a trip to Europe. I needed something smaller than my regular straightener and this was certainly smaller! I have  a lot of hair and it&#x27;s past my shoulders, so this was not really the best for my hair needs, but it heats up quickly and works well. I keep this in my travel bag, but it&#x27;s not my day to day straightener for sure.</li>
    <li> Prodcut cheap..Not hot enough. Please don&#x27;t waist your money</li>
    <li> I have long thick hair, several inches past my shoulders.  This technically worked- but it would take 2 hours to straighten my hair instead of the usual 15 minutes it takes.  1/2 inch is TINY.  It&#x27;s half the size of my chi.  This might work if you have really thin short hair but for someone with long thick hair you are better off bringing the real deal.  Save on luggage space somewhere else.  I gave it 2 stars because yes the product works, but it just takes forever and isn&#x27;t really practical.</li>
    <li> Love it. Heats super fast and is such a space saver for travel.</li>
    <li> The outside become hot when used.</li>
    <li> This is a great travel hair dryer! It has two speed/heat settings and works pretty much like a regular hair dryer. I wish it had a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; setting, but I won&#x27;t complain because of the price!</li>
    <li> This was great for my backpacking trip through the UK. I have bangs and I used this to straighten them in the morning. It is not really meant to do your entire head, because it is so tiny, but if you have a weird bump in your hair, you can definitely straighten it using this...you just need to use really small sections to get it done. This worked great for being so small. :)</li>
    <li> Great little flatiron for SMALL jobs. I have thick hair down the middle of my back and there is NO WAY I would tackle the job of straightening my whole head of hair with this little guy. However, if I blow it dry straight and then finish it off with this, it works quite dandy. I mainly used this for my bangs.</li>
    <li> Great mini straightener for my trip to Italy. Worked great for quick straightening (e.g. my bangs). If you have long/thick hair, it&#x27;ll be a challenge to do your whole head, but it worked great with a simple adapter (you don&#x27;t need the heavy duty converter to make this work in Europe at least).</li>
    <li> I purchased this for an upcoming trip to Iceland and Norway.  I don&#x27;t want to take a hair dryer and am hoping this will tame my wavy hair after air drying.  I have tried it a couple of time and it heats quickly.  I have short hair and it works fine for me.  I like to travel case as I can pack it away immediately after using and not wait for it to cool down.</li>
    <li> Fast and easy transaction.  Easy to use and compact</li>
    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s so cute heats up fast and since I have thin hair I can do my entire hair :-)</li>
    <li> Worked great when traveling abroad. Only need adapter plug. Runs on 110/220 so no voltage converter is needed. Heats up fast. Is very compact so if you have a ton of hair, it&#x27;s going to take you a while. I have shorter hair and it was perfect. Comes with insulated case so you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to cool to put in your suitcase.</li>
    <li> I have had mine for 4 years now. I bought a expensive one at the same time that only lasted 1 year. This one is still going strong.</li>
    <li> Worked great in the UK! Just need to plan some extra time if you have long hair. Love the travel pouch!</li>
    <li> Great travel iron both domestically and in Europe.  So easy - no need to switch between 110 and 220.  Better for short hair because of the size, but it is fine for my medium length hair - just takes longer.</li>
    <li> I put this away for my vacation trip, this spring, but as I was going out of town last weekend, I packed it to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly? I think it does a better job than my full size one! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s product quality or the fact that I had to take smaller hanks of hair to properly flatten, but it worked great!</li>
    <li> I have short hair that tends to wave in spots. I use this to straighten bangs and sections that need it. It heats up quickly. I love it!</li>
    <li> I just needed it for my bangs which aren&#x27;t that long but it didn&#x27;t really do a very good job... Will do in a pinch, though.</li>
    <li> Worked very well and doesn&#x27;t take up much room as it is used mostly on motorcycle trips.</li>
    <li> I bought this last year to take to Paris. At home I use a CHI, which is 110V--and appliances that generate heat (hair dryers, flatirons, kettles, curling irons) will burn out even if used with a voltage convertor.  This one is dual-voltage, tiny, and my hair is long (below shoulder blades); but itâ€™s been keratin-straightened and all I need a flatiron for on the road is to straighten out the smallest bends &amp; crimps after sleeping with a sweaty scalp. This is perfect for that, as I need pass it through only one or two sections (and only part way at that). Most dual-voltage irons are full-size, and take up too much room &amp; weight if flying internationally. Gets hot enough to do what I want, cools down fairly quickly as well. Doesnâ€™t come with an insulated pouch, but if you have an Ove Glove, thatâ€™ll do just fine!  No convertor necessary--just the proper adaptor plug for the country youâ€™re visiting (taking mine to Spain next month).</li>
    <li> Bought this for the girlfriend for travelling and she loves it. Super light and quick to heat up.</li>
    <li> This is just adequate for use while traveling as long as your hair isn&#x27;t too thick or long.</li>
    <li> Takes longer to heat up than my last mini flat iron but does the job.  Dual voltage a plus.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for traveling with. It heats up quickly, works well, and even comes with it&#x27;s own storage insulated holder.</li>
    <li> Wayyyy too small. I have very fine hair and even then this was way too small and would take too long to straighten my hair. I bought it to travel internationally, but I am just going to get a converter and bring my regular straightener</li>
    <li> It did okay.  If you have a lot of hair and its long this would be tedious to use; but if your hair is short and fine I believe it would do well for you.</li>
