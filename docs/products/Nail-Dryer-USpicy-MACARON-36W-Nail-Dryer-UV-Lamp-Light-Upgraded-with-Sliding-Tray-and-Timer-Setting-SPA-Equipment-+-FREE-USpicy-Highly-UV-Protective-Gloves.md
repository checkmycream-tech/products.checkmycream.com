<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When the first I got these I&#x27;m so excited  to use it and omg my shellac came very perfect. .</li>
    <li> Was running late and I needed to do my nails badly before going out of town.. This machine works so good!  Can&#x27;t get the drawer to come out easily but will mess with that later. Did my nails in a breeze. I previously had Nailuv and all the bulbs burned out fast and it was super small and took forever to harden my nails. Love this machine! Hope it lasts..</li>
    <li> Works great. Definitely worth the money</li>
    <li> It works but came with two bulbs out</li>
    <li> Got this UV Drier for the Soak off Gel nail colours i bought from PerfectSummer. Works like a charm and comes with gloves to protect your hands. It arrived before it was scheduled to. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> LOVE this lamp! Great product! Great price! Fast shipping! Thanks so much!!</li>
    <li> Dried my nails quickly and efficiently! I was also pleased with the price.</li>
    <li> Great product Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Love it. At home gel manicures are going to save me a ton!</li>
    <li> I am loving this!  Will save you sooo much money by DIY gel nails. I would advised anyone to watch a couple youtube videos on DIY gel nails if you have never had them before. The most vital thing is to do thin coats and wipe with alcohol after base coat , nail color coats and top coat. My gel nails last 2 weeks and I could go 3 but some of your nail beds will be showing by this time and I did have some peeling on pinky finger going into the 3rd week but that&#x27;s because I was doing a lot of yard work. Yes, it does take about 45 min to an hour to do them which is the same amount of time you will spend at a nail salon. I f you have small hands like I do you can even cross one hand over the other and insert both into the lamp but I prefer to do one hand at a time, that way I can use the free hand to use my phone , browse through a magazine, etc. The shut off time is wonderful too!  I do all 3 min for my cures just to be on the safe side. I have yet to do the gloves yet bc I forget but will do that next time.  This is a must have for ladies who love to keep their nails up!!</li>
    <li> The package arrived on time and was very well packed.  I received a free nail file, and the free UV gloves came separately.  Was very pleased that the lights were already installed.  I followed the directions given by the manual on how to work the timer.  Unfortunately, both the 120 and 180 sec timer did not turn off. :(  I purchased this item because I wanted a lamp with a timer and for this price I thought, what a deal.  I will keep the lamp only because it does work thus far and I can use an egg timer I guess.  Just disappointed.  The hastle of returning and waiting for a new one that the timer may or may not work, is not ideal.</li>
    <li> Love this lamp, so glad I can do my own nails at home! Fast shipment &amp; product was just as described!</li>
    <li> I love it ! I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it, works perfectly and the shipping was really fast ! 😉😊</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now and it is just perfect! Great price and I have had zero problems with it.</li>
    <li> Wife says it works great.</li>
    <li> This is a real money saver.  I can paint my own nails and the paint job lasts as long as when I have it done at the salon.  I was bummed to learn it didn&#x27;t have a blower when I received it but that hasn&#x27;t seemed to make a difference.  I have been using it for several months and have had no issues.</li>
    <li> Really happy with my purchase.  It cures the gel quickly.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.  Bought it a couple months ago when my old lamp stopped working</li>
    <li> I purchased this to do gel nails at home. I&#x27;ve always been a DIY girl when it comes to my nails just because I enjoy it. I was nervous about this light because it&#x27;s so cheap but I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year and haven&#x27;t have a single problem with it. It works great and is small and easier to store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this purchase! No unfulfilled expectations on this product and the price was right!</li>
    <li> I expected the nails to dry faster than this</li>
    <li> Exceeds expectations. It&#x27;s huge but I didn&#x27;t need a portable one anyway. Arrived well packaged and in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with CND Shellac. While waiting on my CND shellac to arrive, I used it with Sensationail Gel polish, top&amp; base coat. It cured perfectly! I love the timer and the size. I can fit in my entire hand or my toes. I&#x27;ve only used this for one manicure and one pedicure so far, but I liked it so much, I ordered another one for my mom! So far, so good!</li>
    <li> LOVE my Uspicy Nail Dryer. $$$ well spent. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love doing my own nails at home. This is perfect!At a fraction of the cost you would pay purchasing this product from a beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> My husband got this lamp and all accessories for me for Christmas (one lucky gal here) .... And I love it!!! Works just like the salon minus the enormous expense. This lamp is super easy to use and provides curing times. My toes are all pretty and will do my fingers later this week. Love Love love this product!&#x27;</li>
    <li> I can not get it to cure the gel nails! Not sure if I got a fauly machine, but am disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with my Nail Harmony Gelish Nail products. It works great and I found it to be the best bargain of the lamps offered. Product arrived on-time and neatly packaged, thank you.</li>
    <li> the lightbulbs were easy to install. its just the right size and you can fit one hand at a time in the lamp. its much easier for me to do my own nails at home than to try and make an appointment or walk in at the salon.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife as a Christmas gift. It was recommended by a few friends who work at a salon. The wife absolutely loves it! I would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she love it! Easy to use! She now does her own nails instead of paying to get them done.</li>
    <li> Item arrived ready to use and in perfect condition! It has ample space for one hand or one foot. I used it to cure IBD builder gel and it worked great! Only thing I wish is that there was a one minute option on timing or that if you pressed the timer start button again it would turn off lights rather than having to turn off entire power, this is not an inconvenience just don&#x27;t know if it will be hard on machine in the long run. I have only used machine once thus far, so can&#x27;t speak to longevity of bulbs etc. but this machine was packaged well, doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, and gets the job done for a lot less money than others.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried all of the polishes yet from BMC, but I did use another gel polish, and I&#x27;m pleased with the appearance, the fast arrival of the lamp, works well, and Saves a lot $ !!  I think that anyone who does spend the time and money to get their mani/pedicures done should, think twice, and try this. This uv dryer works great, simple to use, and arrived in just a few days. This was packaged well so to ensure protection of the bulbs and dryer. I&#x27;m happy and would definitely recommend this brand to others!.  I see this product as an excellent value, plus the cost of 1 manicure / shellac, or gel nails, costs the same as this nail dryer!  how  can you go wrong? By the time a person buys the dryer and polish you have paid for a mani/pedicure. To me taking the time to do this myself, saves hundreds of dollars , especially  if you&#x27;re someone that does this every 3-4 weeks!? and really it&#x27;s not that hard. Great product and there&#x27;s a year warranty!!! I also like the name !! U Spicy!! :)</li>
    <li> Love it! So fast, easy and compact ~ Thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> Got this for a present and it is GREAT! Works good!</li>
    <li> This is an absolute piece of garbage.  I bought it to use with the shellac polish I bought.  Does not work.  It heats up, dries regular polish a little bit, but does not cure the shellac as advertised.  Very upset with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This UV lamp from USpicy works wonders on gel nail polish is really sets it nicely-without going to a salon and paying the big bucks. With a little practice you too can have nails that look like they&#x27;ve been done professionally. This is a great product, with the options of the timing buttons and the back. Though it would be nicer if the buttons were not on the back of the lamp, though because this is a smaller unit its still very nice. Doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space. Comes with everything you need to set and dry your gel polish and its packaged nicely. I think that anyone that has their nails done, should consider buying one of these lamps.</li>
    <li> Thank you for offering this inexpensive nail dryer.  After a little research I figured out how to use it and am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Loved the product so far.  Only used one time, but found it to work very well.</li>
    <li> Bought this lamp, 1 of 4 bulbs doesn&#x27;t work (it&#x27;s not the bulb, its the socket). Emailed company, they promptly responded by refunding my $$ but not shipping. I asked them for a shipping label to return it, have never heard back. Still works, I use it for longer minutes to cure polish since a bulb is missing. Nothing fancy, only has a 2 minute timer but that is fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a few days so I can&#x27;t speak to long term reliability.  I was nervous that other brands failed within the first few uses, but this unit has worked through several sittings.  The inside is lined with reflective metal, and the bottom (also lined with very thin reflective metal) has a pull-out tray.  It&#x27;s handy to remove the tray for cleaning and to install the tubes, which snap very snugly and securely into their fittings.  I&#x27;ve been using this with a gel nail overlay product that is available online for home use (not with Shellac or Gellish yet) and the acrylic gel sets very well under this light.  The unit looks much like the ones you see at professional salons.  The back of the unit has several switches for complete control.  There is a basic on/off switch, a toggle switch to set the timer to 120 or 180 seconds or to &amp;#34;no timer,&amp;#34; and another push button to start the timer (or start the lights if &amp;#34;no timer&amp;#34; is selected). There is also what appears to be a fuse but I haven&#x27;t checked it or needed it.  This unit is very effective and I&#x27;m pleased to be able to do my own gel overlays at home.</li>
    <li> Great lamp for a good price. I upgraded to an LED one for the faster curing time, but this one is great for when I do any UV building/sculpting gels.</li>
    <li> Very nice looking product. It came with a branded pink and white nail file, as well as anti-uv gloves that reach the elbow. Both extra items look and feel like they are made of good quality materials and they use very well too. The lamp itself is very nice, brand new and in perfect working condition. So much better than what i expectedly so a pleasant surprise o both occasions. The only comment i would make is a prompt email to those in EU countries to buy a woltage converting electrical plug. A good idea could be to link some extra items to your product like: You might also be interested in this: US to UK electrical plug. I burnt the first machine because of a voltage shortage because i used to wrong plug so , heads ups on that. Otherwise, super happy with the product, great and reliable seller - the product arrived in just three days. *Thumbs Up*</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, Good price. Works as well as my old professional one.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend got me a gift card from Amazon and I decided to buy this lamp. The price was super awesome taking in consideration what  the package includes. I was afraid at first but decided to give it a go. For now I&#x27;ve only used it 1 time and it works like a charm. For all the people that said that it leaves the gel uncured, in my case it did not happen at all. I used Sensationail gel polish and it cured like it is supposed to. The only bit that does not cure is the tacky layer that every gel polish leaves behind. Back to the lamp, I will post an update when I buy more gel polishes from other brands and will post my results. The only thing I would change is the nail file that comes with the lamp, it feels cheap and does not work one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;My lamp is still going strong and everyone at Beauty school loves it. So far the brands I&#x27;ve used are:&lt;br /&gt;Bundle Monster&lt;br /&gt;Sensational&lt;br /&gt;Ibd&lt;br /&gt;Christina Gel Polish&lt;br /&gt;Elite 99&lt;br /&gt;Gelish&lt;br /&gt;They all cure like they&#x27;re supposed to and within the recommended time (2 min). I really love this lamp and I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already used this lamp many times since receiving it and I&#x27;m very pleased with it&#x27;s performance.  Works well.  Packaged well.  Arrived right on schedule.  You have to insert the bulbs, but they aren&#x27;t difficult.  Just make sure you get that &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; or they won&#x27;t be seated properly.</li>
    <li> First time I used my USpicyUV dryer it exploded and shorted out with my foot in it. Very scary experience. I cannot now get replacement as I didn&#x27;t use it until after the replacement time. DO NOT BUY!!</li>
    <li> I bought this UV lamp by USpicy with the hopes that I would have salon-looking nails at a fraction of the cost. I&#x27;m still experimenting, but I do like this lamp, but keep my nails in it for at least 3x to make sure that the gel is set. Most times it still isn&#x27;t, so I&#x27;m assuming this is my error (using too much gel polish at once?) and will continue using it until I have it properly. Overall, I really like it. It&#x27;s very sturdy, not cheaply made.</li>
    <li> I give this product 10 stars not 5 because it has been my best beauty investment ever!! I used to get my nails done every 2 weeks and now I don&#x27;t have to because I do it all at home. When paired with Gelish base and top coats, this bad boy works like a charm. My nails have lasted a full 2 weeks without any chipping and now my girlfriends come over and do their nails too! I should start charging!</li>
    <li> SUPER easy to use, solid built as well. The seller took a LONG time to send it but it was a good purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> Just used it and it worked just as I hoped! I&#x27;ve only used it once but it works great. It came very nicely packaged. It came with gloves and a nail file which is always a plus when you didn&#x27;t expect that!</li>
    <li> I just purchased this UV lamp to use for my gel manicures. It works great!  It has a timer for 2 minutes and 3 minutes.  It cures the polish really well, no problems. When you get the package, you have to snap in the lights, but it&#x27;s really easy. If you&#x27;re looking for a light that will cure your nails, and is cheap, this is it!</li>
    <li> As many people do,  I read many reviews on Gel/Shellac nail lights. I decided on this one.  I used it with Harmony Gelish products. My first try and the lamp worked perfectly!!!!!!!!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on a more expensive lamp. If you really look around, you will notice this one  rates as high as many that cost more money. Quite simply, it has to be a 36 watt lamp to cure the polish.  If you are a person that gets your nails done professionally with Shellac/Gel, you can save yourself a ton of money doing them yourself with this lamp.</li>
    <li> So far so good! Timer is helpful, just wish it had more incriments,</li>
    <li> I bought this because I couldn&#x27;t afford to get my nails done professionally anymore.  Now I can do it on my time.  This little guy is very helpful.  I also really like that the bottom tray slides out for cleaning.</li>
    <li> The order is just as described.  I&#x27;ve used it twice with no problems or complaints at all.  Great price for this item!</li>
    <li> Great little machine - has a timer on it, gloves to protect your hands.  Works great!</li>
    <li> I love my light, I had to wait for my other product to use it,not this sellers fault. But I have used it twice. I can have pretty nails and not have to spend an arm and a leg. I am so glad I got it!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after debating buying the Creative Nail one, which was $150. I almost threw it away after my first attempt because I did not think it worked; my nails felt sticky and I thought it was not curing the polish. After reading reviews, I played around with it and found if you do the following it works great and lasts for at least 2 weeks- Once you put each THIN coat on, cure it for 2 minutes, do NOT touch the polish because it will smudge, instead put the next coat on. Once you have your base coat, 2 coats of polish, top coat and cured each for 2 minutes between, use a cotton ball saturated with alcohol on the top to remove sticky residue, wait 30 seconds and your nails are completely dry and wont smudge. Good luck, hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Great item!  Worked great!  Don&#x27;t worry about the lower reviews where they say it doesn&#x27;t set right.  That&#x27;s a user error, not the fault of this dryer.  Usually 1 minute per coat does the trick.  Perfect size for at home use.  I had the U-Spicy older model and it worked for a good 3 years.  It&#x27;s good for the money!</li>
    <li> As I stand near the kitchen counter with my hand under the light (the gloves are a nice addition), I try to do some exercises , bends, etc.</li>
    <li> Got it fast and it works great so far.</li>
    <li> I love it it came on time very clean looking and it works great with my gel polish</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how good of a product this is. When I turned it on only 2 bulbs worked and I had to jiggle one of the other one just to get it to show some light. The light from the bulbs is hot so make sure you use the gloves.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my mum for Christmas and she was floored. (Favorite daughter, right here.) She used it just the other day and called me to let me know how happy she was with the gift and the results. I saw her nails the other day, and they looked the same as a salon. I would highly recommend this for a gift or for yourself. I know I will be getting another for myself very soon.</li>
    <li> I love the UV light. I just recently started doing my own at home Gelish mani&#x27;s and pedi&#x27;s and after reading the reviews, I decided to go with this light and I&#x27;m glad I did. No complaints here. I love it!</li>
    <li> I returned this product as it did not dry any of the gel nail polishes I used that came with it. Very Disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> Came as advertised. and works great!  Great seller.</li>
    <li> This is between a 4 and 5 star review. I like this lamp A LOT! But it takes a whole 3 minutes to cure my nails. I&#x27;m thinking of buying an LED for faster drying time. The machine fits your entire hand so it&#x27;s great. The gloves that are included are too long (go to your elbows) and I don&#x27;t use them. The machine works wonderfully for curing UV polish. This is a good machine to have at home.</li>
    <li> Perfect, just like the salon!</li>
    <li> This is FANTASTIC. I have gotten my money back many times over since I purchased this. I use it with Bio Seaweed Gel products (AMAZING non toxic, non stripping, no sanding/buffing gel). I absolutely love this nail dryer. No more manicures outside, saving $15 every 3 wks AND my nails are healthier &amp; stronger.</li>
    <li> Everything was what I expected</li>
    <li> This UVA Light is better than the first one I ordered.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m redoing this review. If you wipe with alcohol after you dry, it removes the stickiness. Otherwise, you think your nails are still wet. The only reason I found out was from another review. Not in directions. Dryer seems to work just fine. Last night after 3 hours of drying, however, I really thought it was defective.</li>
    <li> This UV Nail Lamp works perfectly and was priced much lower than I expected.  I especially like the timer feature.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and it really did a great job of setting the regular polish</li>
    <li> The lamp works great. It came double boxed which makes for easy, safe storing.  The lamp is larger than it appears, so be prepared to store it.  Read the measurements below. You really have to follow the directions on your polish, exactly!  If not, be prepared for the paint to fall off as a whole.  Most polish&#x27; call for 30 seconds.  This light has a timer for 120 or 180 seconds.  I just left the light on while I painted a second coat and it was fine.  Overall, now that I have it figured out, I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I love it, It has saved me SOOO much money doing my own nails, as well as my 5 daughters.  Well worth it!</li>
    <li> excellent product, affordably priced</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with the first lamp I got, customer service rep was amazing, my new lamp works great, thank you Amily!</li>
    <li> Love this product, works like a charm</li>
    <li> Works just like the ones they use at salons when I would go.  Easy to use, and included gloves are a great addition.  Definitely worth buying if you use gel polish.</li>
    <li> I had to try this. I got some gel nailpolish and top coat to test it out. I really liked it. I liked the time on it. With kids running around I don&#x27;t have time to let my nails dry and this so easy to used and dried them fast. I am not the best at doing nails but my nails looked good. I just turned it on, set the time and let my nails dry.</li>
    <li> Works great with my CND and Gelish nail products. Fast delivery. Acceptable price</li>
    <li> I love this lamp, it&#x27;s everything I was hoping it would be and then some!  I just did my first gel nails this past week and the lamp cured them fast and it was so nice to be able to have all 5 fingers done on each hand all at once.  I&#x27;ve looked at and priced many lamps here on ebay and many other sites and the price on this one is great!  Thank you for offering a quality product at an affordable price!!</li>
    <li> This worked great!!! I don&#x27;t like the gloves because I have short hands and they kept slipping down but the light itself is fabulous!  My CND Shellac nails came out great! The lights are above and on the sides, which gives you room to place your hands in without coming right against the lights like with my first UV Light purchase (Thermal Spa) I sent it back immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been over a year and I am STILL loving this light.  I use it every week because I like to change colors and I use it for my nails and my mothers nails, so that is twice the use.  I still HIGHLY recommend this light.  I haven&#x27;t had to change a bulb yet!</li>
    <li> I am a budding nail technician and this product is prefect for me. It has worked very well and I have no issues with it. Delivery was prompt and customer service was very good.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price. No problems. Works as advertised. I use it with CND shellac. What else can I say?</li>
    <li> This product worked great. I used it with CND Shellac. It didn&#x27;t have the timers I needed, but I just turned it off and on. so glad I didn&#x27;t buy anything more expensive (like the CND one!)</li>
    <li> Love it. Works like a professional one</li>
    <li> This UV light works great for gel or shellac nails.  It was a little larger and heavier than I expected. I like the protective gloves that came with the set.</li>
    <li> Works as stated, I pushed the button once between  coats on the first hand, and twice for the second hand. Two cycles at 180 setting for each coat resulted in completely cured nails. Awesome UV dryer with plenty of room to cure all five nails.</li>
    <li> I needed a smaller one and I read so many good reviews on this one so I decided to purchase it.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I&#x27;ve only used it once and I really like the lights on the sides that enables you to dry your thumb at the same time.  The only thing that I dislike is that when you turn your hand upside down to dry your thumb individually, it&#x27;s hard to get the thumb straight without hurting the outer portion of your hand.  The gel polish tends to run to one side when you dry all five fingers at one time.  With my older light the opening was wider and I could easily dry my thumb separately to prevent the gel spilling to the sides.  Other than this little difficulty, everything works perfectly and i&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> nice size dryer and works well!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my wife for Christmas. It looks much sturdier and well built than others I&#x27;ve seen in the stores for similar or more cost. The other reviews seem to confirm this, so I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. I think it will make a nice gift.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first because of the price of this lamp, but i have to admit I was pleasently surprised! I absolutely LOVE this lamp, it has been amazing. Cures the gel very fast and I will make many more purchases from this company. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really only had this machine for a few months, but it really does seem to work as I expected it to. When you put your hand in to dry your nails, it really does cover the whole hand as the lights are arced. I wonder if I can use this to dry regular nail polish? Never tried it, but I do use it to dry gel polish &amp; it does so in 1-3 min. That&#x27;s awesome!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done my first manicure and pedicure and I love this light.  Dries my nails just like in the salon.  One more time and it has paid for it&#x27;s self.  Love saving $$$ and time of going every 2 weeks.  Was able to sit at home in front of my TV and get the job done.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works great, just like the salon and I&#x27;m glad to use these gloves to protect my hands from the UV light.</li>
    <li> This machine is not small, so I could use it not only nails but also crafts.</li>
    <li> When I got this in the mail the part where you but your hand had dents in it. Now that part is starting to cold up. Hope seller replaces it. Other than that works good.</li>
    <li> Really good quality! Exceeded my expectations. I&#x27;ve even dropped it a few times over the years.</li>
    <li> I tried this the night that I got it.  I read the directions that came with the lamp and nail polish(sold separately), and it&#x27;s like shellac.  The gloves are a little ill fitting but for me, that&#x27;s to be expected.  The factory isn&#x27;t going to make an &amp;#34;One size fits all&amp;#34; glove (come on people).  I&#x27;m going to take someone else&#x27;s suggestion to just use sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I used this for the second time, and once again, my nails look awesome.</li>
    <li> Excellent nail dryer! I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Used as directed with CND bottom coat, 2 coats of CND polish, CND top coat but polish did not stay on any longer than using regular bottom coat, polish, top coat and no lamp.  So am disappointed.</li>
    <li> I actually use normal nail polish for the color and use Gelish brand topcoat.  This lamp cures the polish perfectly and I&#x27;m going on a week of chip free wear.  That alone is worth it; and the fact that you can use normal nail polish with just the gel TOPCOAT saves you money (you can use all the polish you already have!). Highly recommend this UV lamp. Do it!!!!</li>
    <li> This works really well!  So, I&#x27;d like to share that once you put your nails under the UV lamp for 2 mins, even though it may feel like it&#x27;s not dried and feels somewhat sticky, just wipe it off with alcohol and continue your next step!  I wasn&#x27;t aware of this and all the YouTube videos never mentioned it.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I was hoping it would be.</li>
    <li> Love it. Does a great job.  Thank you. Definitely would  recommend this product to anyone that loves to do there nails at home</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter.  It was bigger than we expected and worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No regrets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this lamp because it was inexpensive and shipped with Amazon Prime - so I got in 2 days. I love it and it works great for curing Shellac / Gel polishes. Very easy to install the UV bulbs, they just snap in, and it seems there are replacements you can find on Amazon as well, for when they eventually burn out. Timer works great, has two settings, 120 and 180 seconds. Had a slight burning smell with my first use, I hope that will go away, but it didn&#x27;t seem to affect anything else. Hopefully there won&#x27;t be any problems down the road.</li>
    <li> As a licensed nail tech I&#x27;ve used tons of different UV nail lamps on the market and this one ranks as one of the top lamps I&#x27;ve come across! You can&#x27;t beat the price and quality. Plus, USpicy is absolutely fantastic to work with! They shipped it super fast and followed up  on my satisfaction immediately. I would highly recommend this lamp!</li>
    <li> I have now used this for several gel manicures and I love it. I won a certificate to get a free gel manicure and really loved the way the color lasts, but I couldn&#x27;t stomach the cost of getting one every two weeks. I did some research on gel manicure sets and curing lamps and I am so glad I got this lamp and the gelish system. The lamp cures it perfectly and the gelish easily last 3 weeks if the new growth didn&#x27;t make it look funny so I have to remove and do again. Get this lamp! It seems to be the most affordable, comes nicely packaged with some extras -nail file, and UV gloves. The gloves are too large for my tiny hands, but should fit the average user. Have fun!</li>
    <li> The dryer is very sturdy and dries very quickly. I was greatly impressed, especially for the low price. I liked the \\&quot;max\\&quot; timer setting feature.</li>
    <li> I bought this with high expectations because the product description stated clearly that it can be used for gel and shellac. So, I bought the CNC Shellac and tried it out. I followed all the instructions of the lamp but it just can&#x27;t seem to cure it even after sticking my hand under the UV light for nearly an hour!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed and not sure what to do at this point because I can&#x27;t return either products now that I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times already - works great! I read reviews of other lights &amp; it sounded like the 36w were the better lights to get. My polish set up instantly after the first 2 min curing cycle. I did 2 cycles per coat just to be sure. I used the China Glaze brand polish from Sally Beauty Supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a &amp;#34;flash&amp;#34; layer that I wiped off with rubbing alcohol after I cured. I panicked for a second because the polish felt cured but a little slick. Some of the color (a berry pink) came off on the alcohol gauze but the main base layer didn&#x27;t budge. I don&#x27;t think that has to do with the light so much as with the chemical properties of the polish. I ended up doing 2 coats on fingers &amp; toes. The light kept pace with no problems, fairly quiet too. I like that it comes with safety gloves but there needs to be orange safety glasses too - it was hard to NOT look at the light.</li>
    <li> Not drying quick as it describes</li>
    <li> I really like my new nail dryer uv lamp! this came to me on time and in excellent condition. It is a nice little appliance that is made very nicely.</li>
    <li> This nail dryer worked great on my nails.  (I followed the drying times on the polish manufacturer&#x27;s website)  I am notorious for messing up my polish before it dries, but I had no problem after using this nail dryer!  I think it even shocked me..lol.  I was provided a sample of this product in return for an honest opinion and review.  My honest opinion is that this nail dryer does a great job and is well worth the purchase price.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this and loves it!  Easy enough for a child and works well! High quality! Having the gloves included was a huge plus!</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter both absolutely LOVE the USpicy MACARON 36w Nail Dryer. They spent an afternoon together doing mommy-daughter time, so nails, hair...(talking about stuff that I have no clue about) and they loved the machine. I didn&#x27;t hear one bad thing about it, other than the fact we only had one so they had to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product from what they told me about it and I would recommend it to anyone in the market for a nail dryer, or just a gift for that special lady in their lives.</li>
    <li> Very good product for the price. Sets nail polish very quickly.. I love that it has a timer. Easy to use and works very well. It does get hot after awhile. I noticed that I wanted to remove my hands before the timer went off because they were feeling too hot. Other than that I love the light.</li>
    <li> Happy with purchase, did my nails for the 1st time with it last week and I got more compliments on my nails after&lt;br /&gt;doing them myself then getting them done at salon. Looks just like the salon did them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want that dry machine anymore. I want  to refund that money.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> I am not sure how this product got so many better reviews. I bought this for my daughter for Easter. We plugged it in and only 1 light bulb worked. After messing with it for a while, I figured out if I pushed really hard, we could get the light bulbs to click in. But then, as soon as we turned the thing on it started to smoke and smell like something was burning. I thought it would last a little while in case there was dust or something else. But, it hasn&#x27;t gone away. Truly, I am afraid to use it due to the fire hazard it is.</li>
    <li> I used to pay $50 every 2 weeks to get this done, now I can do it at home. Love it!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first because of some of the reviews but I got it and it works great!! Also some said that the bulbs were hard to find so I researched it and their actually pretty easy to find and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I have had this product a month and have used it twice so far. I love the nail gloves provided to protect my skin from the uv light as well as the built in timer. I am happy with this product. I am using CND Shellac to paint my nails and this dryer does it&#x27;s job as it&#x27;s supposed to. Drys the nail polish in 2 minutes. If your using shellac, I would recommend buying this item.</li>
    <li> I had a small UV lamp for shellac manicures at home, but I couldn&#x27;t get my whole hand in it, so I bought this one. It is an excellent, inexpensive alternative to a CND light at $120+. I use OPI, CND, and some off brands, and have had no problem with any of them curing. Excellent purchase! No regrets!</li>
    <li> I researched many uv lamps and finally opted for this one based on more positive than negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I received the lamp quickly. It came packaged in nice box with gloves, instructions and looked brand new. However, the light bulbs were already assembled and the timer doesn&#x27;t work. When I turn the lights on, they just stay on so I had to use a clock to time my nails. It&#x27;s not the end of the world, but it would&#x27;ve been nice if it worked properly.&lt;br /&gt;I used Gelish soak off nail polish, base and top coat. Everything went on just as nice as a salon and I am super happy with being able to effectively do my nails at home. I recommend this product to anyone who wants to do the same without paying an arm and a leg for a lamp or routine salon manicures.</li>
    <li> Just got this in the mail ,  it. I&#x27;ve only used it once but so far it&#x27;s amazing!!</li>
    <li> I was very happy that the USpicy worked as described.  The only thing I modified was that it needed an extra 2 minutes of curing to complete the process.</li>
    <li> So far we love it!  It is not hard to use and the results when used with gel nail polish are great.  Hopefully it will hold up for the long haul!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for over a month and have used it a few times.  It works great.  If you use it correctly and wipe off the top layer with a little acetone after you finish, the nails are good to go.  The dryer came with instructions to assemble which aren&#x27;t very detailed but helpful.  I really liked that the bottom tray comes out, which makes it much easier to install the light bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I did not give this a five star rating is that the gloves that come with the dryer came apart at the seams the very first time I used them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s is a very good dryer but I ordered it twice because the first time it never came so I had to c all cs to get my money back  I did get my money back  but beside that I love it</li>
    <li> I gave two stars for the reason above. There was only 2 bulbs, there was supposed to be four bulbs. The two bulbs that were in the machine were on the right side so its difficult to use, awkward. You have to put your hand to one side every time and if you don&#x27;t the gel doesn&#x27;t cure and it looks terrible, runs down one side.&lt;br /&gt;On top of that its not easy to open it up and move the bulbs, you have to get screw drivers and find all the screws and take it apart just to move/replace bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived with a loose screw that was rolling around in the box.&lt;br /&gt;The timer on the back is a plus. The gloves were a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this due to its difficulty and awkwardness to use, and definitely not to a professional that intends to use on clients, asking a client to hold their hand in an awkward position every time would be embarrassing and unprofessional. A.K.A. janky.</li>
    <li> This works wonderfully... I love it and so do my nails! I share with my sisters and we are very happy with it. Thanks</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure which type (LED or UV) to purchase or which brand, but I chose this one based on price and other reviews.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  It is sturdy and works great.</li>
    <li> I had purchase a machine from a local hair store and after finding this one, I returned the unused machine back to the store and purchase this machine and I am glad I did.  It is a great machine and it does everything I expected and more.  You will not go wrong if you decide on this one.</li>
    <li> I got this after reading all of the reviews from this light and other ones. I thought the price and rating was really good! I tried it yesterday for the first time and I was a little frustrated with the curing time, but I later found out it wasn&#x27;t working because I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing. My sister watched a tutorial and hers turned out really good! Sometimes I think it&#x27;s easy to blame the machine but it&#x27;s important to realize that it might not work if the user doesn&#x27;t know what they are doing!</li>
    <li> This definitely worked better than the last one but still took about 6 minutes to dry completely. It really only works on gel or gel like nail polishes. If you are going to use any other kind of polish, it has to be a very thin coat otherwise the dryer can&#x27;t dry it.&lt;br /&gt;I also cut the gloves that come with it so that it only covers up to my wrists. It&#x27;s way too hot and way too much work to roll all of that up your arm.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good product once you know how to manipulate it.</li>
    <li> Works great. I&#x27;ve had mine for quite some time now and I love it. I use it all the time. Your whole hand fits comfortably in there. Dry time is fast to!</li>
    <li> So far very happy with the product. The only thing I would do differently is the gloves. They should have elastic aroung the fingers to keep it in place. Other tan that it works well and I would recommend it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far, but it met my expectations in regards to curing CND Shellac Polish. The unit has more than enough room for a hand or foot, the bulbs came already installed, the timer works as expected and I really like the included UV protectant gloves. They fit my hand nicely but, they are one size fits all... so if you have larger palms or thicker fingers they may not fit very well (not much stretch).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have mentioned, make sure to follow manufacturer instructions for both the machine and the polish you are using for best results. I can&#x27;t speak to how long the bulbs last, however I see that replacements are available on Amazon for ~$9/each when needed. Great value for the money!</li>
    <li> Great little light. I kinda wish I had gotten one for both hands to fit in but I make it work by stacking my hands. I also wish there was a better button system - there&#x27;s only two settings for time and both are a lot longer than any of the times my polishes are telling me to use. I have to turn the whole thing off and on to turn the light off between coats. I&#x27;d rather not waste the energy or get light on the polish before I&#x27;m ready. But, it was a good price for me to casually use this device. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Worked exactly as expected. A little bigger than I was expecting that&#x27;s why I have it 4 stars. Happy it came with gloves and a file!!</li>
    <li> I received it in a timely manner but when I opened the box a piece of one of the brackets that hold one of the uv bulbs was broken off and that back corner of the light is bent inside also. I was very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Great set.  I can do my own nails at home now!</li>
    <li> This lamp is easy to use and come with protective gloves.  The timer switch is simple with 2 choices and is easy to feel in the back of lamp.  It  takes up quite a bit of space on the shelf though.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, works great, and is the perfect size for easy storage! Great for personal home use. Good customer service.</li>
    <li> great for the money and works well for shellac manicure</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before finally deciding on the Uspicy light. I was worried that it wasnt going to work, but my nails turned out great.</li>
    <li> I used it few times and seems like this thing works. Oly thing is do it before going to sleep and apply good moisturizer or facial mask after because you will be red. I applied argan oil first time and aloe Vera second time. Awesome result. I think I will take photo now and again after 1 month of using, to see actual result. I still didn&#x27;t download detailed instructions , only used it as it says on the box.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. Love it!!!! I have been using this lamp and so far I am loving it. No issues and it cures great.</li>
    <li> Although I have my nails done in a salon from time to time- I do many refills and touch ups at home and love this product.&lt;br /&gt;It does exactly what it says- cures ( dries) gel nails in minutes- smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;The price is an added bonus- and I recommend this without reservations</li>
    <li> Up until last night I would have given a 5-star review. But, the timer no longer works after only using it 4 times.  To be honest, I didn&#x27;t even realize it at first because the timer is for 2 minutes and my first coat is for 1 minute.  So, I downloaded a stopwatch app on my phone to keep track.  The next coat was for 2 minutes and I was watching television so I did not notice right away that it did not turn off.  When I put the first coat of color on, I turned the stopwatch on and pulled my hand out at 2 minutes but the light stayed on until I turned it off in the back.  After that I had to use the stop watch and after 2 minutes I had to turn it off and on in the back. I still have to hit the timer button in the back to get the lamp to turn on.  This definitely a pain in the neck and not what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Just used my light for the first time last night and it was perfect! Did exactly what I wanted it to do, which was to cure my shellac polish. I also used it to dry my toes from using regular polish. Great price and great product!</li>
    <li> Works great! I use it to shellac my own nails at home. The timer is fantastic and I use the nerdy, but practical gloves to protect my hands. Love it so far!!</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this and could not be any happier with her purchase. I do know by watching her that it does take awhile to normally do her nails and with this it cuts the time down tremendously plus she says it helps to keep the nails from smudging.</li>
    <li> my wife bought this to do her own nails. she loves it and it was less than 20 bucks. that is less than one trip to the nail salon</li>
    <li> Item was very well handeled and packaged with care. This light is awesome. It does great curing any polish I use. I&#x27;ve done the gel from target as well as purchased some more expensive OPI and Gelish colors.  You can fit a whole hand inside so its not one you have to dry one finger at a time. I thought it was very well priced compared to other lamps that were either very cheap quality or waaay too pricey. I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase, only down part is i love changing my nail colors so much i end up chipping off my old polish to change it to something else. Excellent lamp so far.</li>
    <li> Bad product. Did not dry my nails &amp; I left it under the dryer almost 20 mins each hand.  Needless to say I returned it for a refund</li>
    <li> Only had the dryer for a few weeks but so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dryer works to cure my Gelish Nail Polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just started doing my own Gel Nails to avoid the money not well spent on gel manicures that were too pricey and half the time not done to my standards so I looked into a nail lamp to get started with. LED lights cure your nails faster but the price tag gets steeper. So I wanted to start off with a cheaper UV light since I just started. I looked at many reviews for many UV dryers on Amazon and this one seemed the best bang for your buck. Even comes with gloves to protect your hands from the UV lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wished the button in the back would turn the lamp off when it is not set to a specific time (Other than 2 or 3 minutes). I have to turn the machine off in order to do that. Other than that the lamp has met my expectations so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basic Gelish Nail Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1) Clean nail off with rubbing alcohol (or nail cleanser [[ASIN:B00468KRH8 Harmony Gelish Gel Cleanser - 120ml - 01250]]) &gt;&gt; Removes any moisture/oil&lt;br /&gt;2) Apply PH prep bond [[ASIN:B004J6WCBQ Hand &amp; Nail Harmony Gelish Nail Prep pH Bond - 0.5 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;APPLY ALL COATS IN THIN LAYERS&lt;br /&gt;3) Apply Foundation [[ASIN:B007TLJP2W Gelish .5 Base &amp; Top Coat Gel SET Harmony Nail Salon UV Manicure Polish Soak Off]]&lt;br /&gt;UV 2 MIN&lt;br /&gt;3a) OPTIONAL: Apply Structure gel [[ASIN:B0045K1N8E Harmony Gelish Soak-off Gel Polish Structure Gel 0.5 Oz]] if your nails are in poor condition and need them to be stronger :: UV 2 min&lt;br /&gt;4) Apply 1st coat of color&lt;br /&gt;UV 2 MIN&lt;br /&gt;5) Repeat step 4 until coats are a desired finish :: UV 2 MIN with each color coat&lt;br /&gt;* For darker colors cure last coat for 3 minutes to be safe *&lt;br /&gt;6) Apply Top Coat [[ASIN:B007TLJP2W Gelish .5 Base &amp; Top Coat Gel SET Harmony Nail Salon UV Manicure Polish Soak Off]]&lt;br /&gt;UV 2 MIN&lt;br /&gt;7) Clean nail off with rubbing alcohol (or nail cleanser [[ASIN:B00468KRH8 Harmony Gelish Gel Cleanser - 120ml - 01250]]) &gt;&gt; Removes tacky feeling to give nails a clean, smooth, dry finish</li>
    <li> Bought this product and it never works even went and get new bulbs because the power light works still no result</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I first ordered the UV Gel Nail Dryer because it was so inexpensive.  The product turned out to be a great value.  I also received it very quickly.  I was highly satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Purchased with Gelish Basix Kit so I would not have to pay $30 every 2 weeks to get nails done and I have been very pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;My nails are very thin, break and crack easily, into the quick a lot of times. Keeping my nails up with gel products and this UV lamp has helped me solve this problem.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter. She loves it. She had my sister and my niece over and they played nail salon. She said if was better than going to have done. They did each other&#x27;s nails and everyone was so happy. If was as good as going to and paying 25.00 each. Now they are going to expand their nail colors and do this every few weeks. Also came when promised. Would definetly recommend to friends. The alcohol is very important. Must use to help cure nails.</li>
    <li> gift for niece.  She liked it</li>
    <li> I love this!  I&#x27;m not a nail tec. I just want pretty polished nails. This item works great on gel polish and is very roomy. You can do feet too with this. Great purchase!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to paint up my nails every week, but it works great for a hard gel polish that&#x27;s easy to maintain. Drying time may be a little slow, but I&#x27;m perfectly willing to wait! Came as described and does the job</li>
    <li> So glad that I didn&#x27;t buy the expensive one.  The timer is for two minutes and its exactly the perfect time.  You don&#x27;t need to be paranoid of its power and double up your time.  I figured this out the long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had to buy replacement bulbs, so you&#x27;ll have to check on the price of them.  I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> The timer doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> This uv lamp works fine.  Just like in the salon. So far I&#x27;ve used the gelish nail gel color and it cured the gel perfectly.&lt;br /&gt; I even use regular quick dry nail polish between the base and the top off gel polishes and it worked great.  Your nail will last at least 3 weeks depending on how rough you are with your nails.  But doing your nails would become so easy with the UV lamp, you would want to change your color almost every 2 weeks.  It saves time and money for sure.  I love it!</li>
    <li> One of the bulbs was cracked when I received it so they sent me a discount on it. Even with 3 bulbs it works great. It also came with UV protective gloves and a nail file. I use this lamp all the time &amp; highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was really unsure about ordering this...and in turn was pleasantly surprised by the lamp. I ordered on a Thursday and received it on the following Monday!! I of course used it right away....and it WORKED!! The packaging was very well done..I felt like the item I was getting was handled very well. I have used it several times already and have not had any issues. I use gelish by harmony which I also ordered on Amazon and I equally love as much as the lamp!! Goodbye expensive nail salons!!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT...LOOKING FORWARD TO NAIL POLISH FUN!!!</li>
    <li> My wife had a cheaper lamp which took forever to dry her polish. She ordered this one &amp; so far she has been very happy with it. It dries her nails much faster than her old lamp. It feels cheaply made, but it works fine. I would suggest taking care when using it because it does not feel like it would last through much abuse.</li>
    <li> I gave myself a gel nail manicure and it was a success! This lamp cured the nail products just as it should and is big enough to fit your entire hand inside to include your thumb.  Some dryers are small and you have to do the thumb separately adding to the overall time spent on the manicure.  This comes with gloves to protect skin.  I thought about spraying hands with sunscreen before I prep the nails.</li>
    <li> This lamp does a great job of drying gel (shellac) polish.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is that the timer is off by 15 seconds (It seemed to stop a bit short, so I timed it.)  Not a problem, though; I just take that into consideration when using.</li>
    <li> It worked really well and I am very happy with it. I would tell my friends to get one if they ask about it.</li>
    <li> Having a great experience with this product. I bought this along with the Axxium base coat, Gelish polish and Axxium top coat. Holy cow, my polish really does last two weeks! I read a lot of reviews of UV lamps before settling on this one. I like that the bulbs are pre-installed, I like the optional timer which is conveniently pre-set to the two curing times recommended by the gel lacquers, and I like that it comes with UV gloves, which I wanted to purchase anyway. I&#x27;ve only used it for four manicures but so far so good. Great purchase, extremely pleased.</li>
    <li> I bought this nail dryer for my daughter since the LED dryer she had will not dry the UV shellac polishes that she likes. So far she really likes it and says it does a hreat job. She likes that it is large and she can put her whole hand inside to dry her thumb at the same time.  She has no complaints.</li>
    <li> I had one gel manicure before Christmas and I LOVED it. But I didn&#x27;t want to spend $40 every two weeks. So I started researching Gels and Shellacs. I loved my gel manicure, so I decided to go that route. Sally&#x27;s had a cheap UV mini light for $20, or a nicer one for $60. I didn&#x27;t want cheap, but I thought $60 was a bit much. So I took to the internets! I landed on this one because it had good reviews, and was a VERY reasonable price. I am VERY happy with it. I ordered it on a Thursday and it came the following Tuesday. I use the Gelish brand of gels because that&#x27;s what is most readily available to me, at Sally&#x27;s. Be sure to read all of the instructions on applying the gels before you start. When I had my professional manicure, I noticed that after she had applied a top coat, she wiped my nails with something on a paper towel. I found out that it was rubbing alcohol. The gels leave a sticky \\&quot;residue\\&quot;, and I learned last night that you need to wipe the base coat with the rubbing alcohol after curing it to get rid of that \\&quot;residue\\&quot;. (I thought that it just hadn&#x27;t cured, so I looked it up.) And then you also have to do the \\&quot;residue\\&quot; removal after the top coat. The UV light apparently does require a longer cure time VS an LED light. 1 minute for the base coat, and 2 minutes for both the color and the top coat. But the whole process took me about an hour, which is as long as I&#x27;d spend on a regular polish home manicure, only to have it chip after 2 days. Another tip is that with dark colors, I used Gelish Bella&#x27;s Vampire, I had to apply 3 coats because you have to be sure to apply each coat VERY VERY thinly. Otherwise they won&#x27;t cure properly. All in all, a great buy, and a great system!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product and think it was well worth the money!! I am so happy that I waited and didn&#x27;t buy an expensive one elsewhere. It&#x27;s quiet and big enough to seem like it will last. I&#x27;ve only done my nails once but that was a week ago and they still are perfect! I was able to get this when it was just $29. Great deal for the money!!</li>
    <li> very satisfied with everything.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. Salon quality. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Works well.  Was shipped fast.</li>
    <li> I am really glad I bought this lamp.  I haven&#x27;t had a single problem with it.  The only thing that worried me a little was that when I opened the package, it had clearly been opened before as there were fingerprints inside it and all the bulbs were already plugged in.  However, there&#x27;s also a lot of stuff added into this package, so I assumed the seller opened it and put the lights in to make room for the other things added to the box, like the nail file and gloves.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 10 year old daughter and it works really well. Great to be able to save tons of money with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this item for av week but so far it works great. Revived my item i in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product so I could save money instead of getting my nails done at the salon.  This product is perfect.  It showed up with one bulb not working but I called and they sent a replacement bulb out right away and I use it all the time!  Great product, and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Fits perfect in table and works great</li>
    <li> No complaints, it does exactly what I need it to do! It has convenient 2 and 3 minute settings located on a rocker panel in the back. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that  &amp;#34;timer off &amp;#34; is right in between the one and two min settings so it&#x27;s very easy to miss what you&#x27;re trying to set it to. I realized my nails were curing a really long time and that I&#x27;d accidentally turned the timer off.</li>
    <li> Thank God to this product. With 2 kids and no help I get to keep my nails looking decent by getting my nails done at home and quickly! Definitely would recommend</li>
    <li> I thought especially because of the wattage that the polish would cure in like 2 or 3 minutes...NOT!!!!</li>
    <li> nice light, we&#x27;re all learning how to do our nails, fun. easy to use</li>
    <li> Received this product in the mail, opened it and used it right away. My cosmetology school uses CND professional lamps and this lamp completely cures the gel unlike the CND lamps. I couldn&#x27;t be anymore happy for the quality and price of this lamp. The only thing I have to mention is the timer button doesn&#x27;t work anymore, but who needs a timer?!</li>
    <li> As others have said this product works!!</li>
    <li> Happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> This works great as if I&#x27;m using it at the salon.  Great product for the price.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Seems fine.  A bottom that slides out &amp; in would be helopful.  No idea yet how it will hold up long term.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, high-quality product that is easy to use. It is well-built and not flimsy. I normally prefer LED lamps for gel polish, but some of my colors don&#x27;t cure all the way in LED lamps. I bought this Uspicy UV lamp to cure those colors (dark ones), and it works great. I might just use it for my light colors too. There&#x27;s a timer you can use for either 2 minutes or 3 minutes; you can also select no timer at all and just turn it off manually. I also received a pair of protection gloves along with this lamp. I had expected the gloves to be kind of cheesy and just a thrown-in type of item, but they are as high-quality as the lamp. The gloves come up to my elbows and are made of a nice, soft microfiber. This is a good brand.</li>
    <li> I use this lamp at home with my Gelish Soak Off gel nail polish system.  It works great and seems to be well made. It was shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition. I really like the timer. I was afraid that with such a great price, I was \\&quot;getting what I paid for\\&quot; but I know now it&#x27;s a real bargain. Don&#x27;t bother with a lamp with less than 36 watts but don&#x27;t think you need an expensive LED lamp. For gel nail polish (I can&#x27;t speak about other uses) it&#x27;s a great choice. Also, for the record, I love my Gelish system. It&#x27;s easy to apply and looks fabulous!</li>
    <li> Ordered 3. Works great and it&#x27;s really light.</li>
    <li> This nail dryer does the job but I wish it were a little taller. It&#x27;s difficult to put both hands in at the same time...one on top of the other, fingers spread. That being said, it&#x27;s a great nail dryer at a spectacular price.</li>
    <li> so far, still  good, all the lights on but we haven&#x27;t try it yet. hope do the job. they come with glove for UV light and couple more things. no bad. having extra its always Good deal.</li>
    <li> cute and it works properly. Used it several times already! worked properly each time.&lt;br /&gt;only downside, there were scratches on the metal part when I opened it. Im usually picky about item representation but I just didn&#x27;t bother because I waited quite a bit. Besides that, I like it.</li>
    <li> This little UV dryer worked sporadically the first time (the bulbs barely connected and came out of their sockets easily) I used it and it wouldn&#x27;t work at all the second time.  I opted to spend a little more and get a much higher quality dryer.</li>
    <li> The lights were easy to install. I love the timer options. I just never realized how heavy it could be. Pretty heavy and bulky. But it does the job well</li>
    <li> I got this for myself for Christmas and have saved so much money in having my nails done.  Looked on YouTube for directions on how to do gel nails, nothing I bought really gave clear directions, but YouTube is full of tutorials.  Also, I know I wondered about this after I bought the unit...You can use this to cure the Sally Hansen Insta Gel nail strips.  Huge time saver over using the SH unit that you can only do one nail at a time.</li>
    <li> I was worried from the other reviews, but I have used it three times and it works great! It completely set the shellac, you have to leave your hand it for about a minute extra compare to other higher quality/wattage machines, but I love the timer feature and it was shipped quickly!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been over a year and it&#x27;s still going strong. love it!</li>
    <li> Love this! Got the item faster than it said was packed wonderfully n it works GREAT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I  bought this item for my girlfriend who was so excited to receive it. She just received this lamp today and as soon as she unpacked the item, we realised that it was damaged. the bottom piece of the item (which you rest your hand on) is made of a plastic base and a has a metal surface. the metal surface was already unsticking from the base. i will be sending it back today and ordering something else.</li>
    <li> Amazing light for gel nail polish. Cures in 2 mins. Shipping was fast and packaging was neat. Great product would buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> I have used it 3 times since I got it 6 days ago, and it works wonderful. I even dropped it once after I used it (it was in the uspicy box it came in with the bubble wrap) from about 4 feet in the air, and it turned on like a champ. I used the lamp with cnd top and bottom coat, and with bmc polish, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  After 3 uses, it&#x27;s paid for itself!</li>
    <li> The customer service is great! I had questions and they answered my questions with a prompt response. I was nervous when I first used the product but no need to be! It works great, just like the shop! I decided after the nail tech included their tip in the no chip price and I was paying $45 every two weeks that it was time to try this myself and it looks just like a $45 no chip! I recommend the gelish Polish or Shellac. I also used the ph bond, foundation, and top coat from gelish! This UV light works awesome!</li>
    <li> This Nail Dryer works perfectly! It gives you two timer options, 120 or 180 seconds but the 2 minutes was more than enough time to dry my gelish nail polish that I purchased from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. It comes with protective gloves and a nail file which is a nice bonus. It is easy to use and it was packaged very well. I am very happy with this item.</li>
    <li> This light does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> The nail dryer definetly does it&#x27;s job. Unfortunately the timer doesn&#x27;t. Overall I am a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Unit was broken when it arrived. I haven&#x27;t been able to get resolution.</li>
    <li> I was very easy to use and effective for my gel nail polish. ..</li>
    <li> Works great. Does not cure as fast as the LED lamps but does a good job.</li>
    <li> This item took quite a while to arrive, but it works well. I would reccomend.</li>
    <li> Works great! I was hesitant at first but got it and used CND products and worked great! No chipping and it&#x27;s been a week now! I&#x27;m a nurse so I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands but no wear noted!</li>
    <li> I am currently light-cured acrylic for my nails and find that the drying process takes three, sometimes four 120 - 180 sec intervals to completely dry the nails. Other than that, I am very happy with the purchase. Have not used it that long yet and cannot speak to the longevity of the bulbs.</li>
    <li> Bought this brand new in January 2014 and have been happy with it except that 1 of the bulbs died at 6 months with light use (I&#x27;ve used this lamp for about 10 gel manicures  since purchase). Now that I know about LED lamps, I wish I would&#x27;ve instead purchased one of those.</li>
    <li> Sorry but I returned this item because the light would malfunction after only 1 day of trying it.</li>
    <li> my granddaughter loved it.</li>
    <li> Received product and works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gh h hd d d h hni bc g gx w d h vgh y</li>
    <li> We received this item and the bulb was not set in place correctly and was not working.  We were afraid to adjust it.  We were finally able to put it in place, but it didn&#x27;t work.  We finally received the extra bulb</li>
    <li> the uv gel nail dryer is a great product, l like it.&lt;br /&gt;no complaints so far.&lt;br /&gt;the package was good too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve truly enjoyed using my new nail dryer and wished I&#x27;d purchased it earlier. I&#x27;ve decided to do my nails and toes at home more frequently and this was an excellent buy. It&#x27;s not heavy, but seem very sturdy. It dried my toes and nails in the set times, which are super fast. After drying, my polish looks like a million bucks and I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks USpicy for including the UV glove protectors, but wish you included protectors for my feet. I&#x27;m creative so I made a pair of protectors out of an old pair of socks and they work like a charm. Being able to do my gel nails at home has become more enjoyable.</li>
    <li> Does a great job, no need for more expensive uv lights. Timer works perfectly, is compact enough that I just keep it tucked away in its box when not in use. Also glad it comes with gloves to protect hands from uv rays. Wish this company would consider an led version.</li>
    <li> Lamp works great! Very glad I chose this one as it is cheaper than the cnd lamp and it cured my shellac just fine. You just have to keep in mind that every layer of shellac will be sticky after curing until you remove the stickiness with alcohol off the top coat once your done. So if it&#x27;s sticky after curing it doesn&#x27;t mean the lamp didn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> This works great.  I have used it three times now with no problem.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Worked fine for 6 months...then flickering lights and some bulbs randomly not working.  I bought this lamp because I was hoping, considering the higher price, I would get a better item.  Nope.  Should&#x27;ve just bought the cheap one.</li>
    <li> Just did my gel nails, got it today. Love it. Works really well. I hope it works the same way the next time I use it.</li>
    <li> Works great and it saves me a ton of money on my gel manicures.  If it breaks tomorrow it would have paid for it self. One gel manicure costs $30.00. I have used it for a couple of months already and could not be happier with my purchase. I love the fact that it came with gloves to protect the user from uv light exposure.  The salon never made me wear gloves.  Also it has 2 built in timers one for 2 minutes and one for 3 minutes, you don&#x27;t have to use the timers you can turn it on and leave it for however many seconds/minutes your gel polish requires. Overall great purchase for the money. There are other gel lamps out there but why spend more when this one can do the job just as good as the other lamps. I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all but returning it was easy and I got full refund for the item.  Wish it worked since my wife really liked it.</li>
    <li> Great product, exactly what I was looking for. I have used it about 5 times and it has worked great each and every time!</li>
    <li> Leaves my nail polish tacky...</li>
    <li> This light works great.  Sets up the nails in a timely fashion.  The opening is big enough for the whole hand.  You can set it for 2 minutes, 3 minutes and unlimited.  The light came with UV gloves which I have yet to use.  For the price it is a good value.  The bulbs are included and easy to install.  Shipped quickly which was good also.</li>
    <li> This came sooner then expected. And for the price, it works pretty well! Over all, I&#x27;m happy with this product and will recommend it to my friends!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve receive my dryer and I&#x27;m please with the the product. When got the dryer the bulbs didn&#x27;t work , but they was very kind to seen me send me some more bulbs..very please. Thx u</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a pro. But want to do my own shellac nails.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great lamp, comes with special gloves to protect your hands if you&#x27;re concerned as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very decent nail lamp. Has a timer that has two settings. Can also just be &amp;#34;on.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;As it says in the instructions, dont set stuff on top. Could damage the bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you leave your polish bottles near the lamp when its on, it could get hard if it&#x27;s in the line of the light. Set it away from the light or behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for starters.</li>
    <li> Wonderful light works fine. I do my own nails so this makes gel nails fun and now I can change them more often.</li>
    <li> Awful. Did not cure my shellac nails at all, even after 10 minutes!!!  Very disappointed - it will be returned.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the price of 1 salon manicure and use it all the time!! It&#x27;s fantastic..salon grade. I use it combined with Gelish brand products and if you take your time you have your own salon quality gel nails. I&#x27;m a DIY kinda girl and I&#x27;d be lost without this!!!</li>
    <li> I received this dryer right before Christmas and have only used it once, but it does a great job.  I don&#x27;t take the time to do gel polish regularly, but this dryer was easy to use and did the job beautifully.</li>
    <li> I bought this gel nail dryer for my daughter in college. She loves it works perfectly no issues.&lt;br /&gt;Very fast delivery Well worth the money thanks sooo much :)</li>
    <li> I use this nail dryer all the time! It works amazing and very fast! Saves me so much money doing my nails at home instead of going to the salon, and it lasts just as long!</li>
    <li> I will Definetely give 5 stars but on my very firts use one of the bulbs flicks a lot until is warm enough. I think it is the bulb because I changed places and the same bulb flicks, after a while works fine. The 120 sec timer shuts off at 60? Any way it cures the nails very quick and I liked the results but 4 stars if not 3 cuz a brand new product gives you a little trouble.</li>
    <li> The system pays for itself after one or two polishes. Super easy to use! Plus, I love the timer feature. Works with any gel polish.</li>
    <li> I got this light for using my Gelish nail polish and it works great! There is a timer on it for 120 seconds or 180 seconds its the perfect size and gives you a lot of extra room so you are not cramming your hand in a tight space. I have pretty big hands with long fingers and i can put my whole hand in with room to stretch my fingers. The bulbs are easy to put in just make sure they click when you are putting them in so you know they are in place. Like i said i use this for my gel nails and it processes them perfectly do not waste your money buying a higher priced lamp. Also this lamp came with an awesome nail file and gloves for anyone who is worried about uv exposure on your hands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this lamp for over a year now and I love it! It has two timer setting which is perfect. The bottom slides out so I can do my toes. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it and I&#x27;ve even dropped it off my bed lol.</li>
    <li> Gel Nail Dryer did not meet my expectations. Drying time is too long. It is very different from professional dryer.</li>
    <li> Started doing my own nails at home.  Was very new to the whole process. After doing some research I purchased this uv light. The price was right so I chose this one. I am so glad I did.  I not only do my nails but, my family as well. This light works great. The tray comes out easy for cleaning, and the timers 120/180 sec. is a great little feature. No need to watch the clock.  Just love it, thanks for an inexpensive way of doing my own nails. Kathy in Ma</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s drying my nails.  They are not getting hard. Although it could be an error on my part, but I am keeping them under extra long.</li>
    <li> it is been a year !! it works great</li>
    <li> Was happy with the price and shipped very quickly. But after first couple weeks, all the lights just stopped turning on. The machine it self did turn on, as you flip the on switch a light on the button to turn on the lights went on, but i pushed that button and the lights refused to turn on.:( Was happy I got refund even after a month, I give them a 5 stars in their service..i was just unlucky to receive one that failed to work</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on amazon for most of the gel curing lights before buying this one.  I was a little concerned it wouldn&#x27;t work straight out of the box.  I&#x27;ve had it over 4 months now, and it works like a charm.  It does not have a fan inside, the lights at the salon where I&#x27;d been paying to get my nails done every 2-3 weeks did.&lt;br /&gt;My friends &amp; I get together for mani/pedi parties and this light has gotten a work out!  No problems so far, despite the regular use.  I bought some gelish items to get started, also a much better deal ordering from amazon.  The local beauty supplies sell smaller bottles for almost twice the price.  I personally have saved hundreds doing my nails myself.  I&#x27;m considering buying another just because word is now out among my friends &amp; family and it would cut down on time since there are so many of us using one curing light.  I also bought one for my aunt as a gift and it works great.  This has a 2 minute &amp; 3 minute timer.&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions on the polish bottle for the curing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  The light is still working great, have had no problems! Between me, friends &amp; family, this light gets used for at least 2 manicures a week, every week.  Another friend ordered one for herself after using mine for holiday manicures.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend does her nails and spends decent amount of money at local manicure shop, so I thought that she might find this handy. And I was right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is pretty straightforward, and easy to use. I only need to flip on the switch, and the lamp goes straight to work and to dry her freshly painted nails. While she can’t do the design of her nails at home, at least she can maintain her nails and keep them polished without dropping big bucks. The device also comes with a 120 seconds timer, so she can keep track of how long she has been drying her nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a great device. Highly recommended for those that frequent manicure places.</li>
    <li> just as described great alternative to going to salon, I can sit at home comfortably in the evening at a much less price</li>
    <li> It does a great job in drying nails</li>
    <li> Easy to use... Good size.... Love the timer on it</li>
    <li> I was skeptical purchasing this UV light online. I searched and compared, searched and compared. Reviews were all over the place. Made me a little hesitant. I went with the USpicy and it was a great choice. Easy to use, has a timer, good quality and cures my nails just right. I only purchased one to see how it was. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing another to cut my time in half sharing obw for both handa and feet.</li>
    <li> I have used this a couple of times and it is the perfect size. It also comes with a very nice pair of fingerless gloves.</li>
    <li> loved the product. somehow I missed that the gloves where coming in the package too. when I opened the boxes, I was pleasantly surprised to discover gloves and a few other handy things. it looks cute and very feminine. works great. I have no complaints. I use it for my gel nails. 1 minute foundation, 2 minutes top and done. super easy and quick.</li>
    <li> this lamp is great. sets my shellac nails perfect--glad i tried shellac diy! I first bought the shany uv light, and after a timer and a bulb that didn&#x27;t work, I decided to send it back and try this one. It is much heavier and feels much sturdier. The light bulbs actually \\&quot;click\\&quot; solidly into place, unlike the shany. Plus, this one is pink and cuter! (not that that part really matters, but its a bonus IMO). :) definitely go with this uv light--you&#x27;ll be glad you spent the four extra dollars on this one and saved all the money by not going with the official cnd one!</li>
    <li> Works Amazing!! I was skeptical about buying this uv lamp because ive never done shellac nails but its actually very easy!! I even bought a second uv lamp for my cousin!</li>
    <li> Great product ,very affordable ,and easy to use! Since I got it I do my gel nail myself ... It pay itself in one use☺️</li>
    <li> Works soooooo slowly! Cures in 10 minutes (or probably more) Took my sister and I about an hour and a half for both</li>
    <li> I love the timer on it. It works great! Has a bit longer cod than my last one! So I like that</li>
    <li> I love how big this is. Love the 2 timers. I got it for doing my own gel nails and the free gloves was a bonus too. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This works perfectly &amp; is simple to use. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to do their own nails. No more salons!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Instructions are not all that clear but easy enough to figure out.  One tip, if you use the timer and change from 120to 180 sec, you have to turn the unit off before you make the time change.</li>
    <li> it came in great time and works like a charm! i love all the extra gifts they give you! highly reccomend this product</li>
    <li> It has works great for me. took out of the box, and used it. Easy instructions. I recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!!!! Works great and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, dry gel nails!!! Definitely worth the money and pays for itself within a month. Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I was nervous buying a UV nail dryer and read as many reviews as I could.  I decided on this dryer and am thrilled.  It works beautifully.  Would totally recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Works well.  Excellent deal.</li>
    <li> my package arrived  ahead of schedule delivery I love this lamp it cures my nails pretty fast and it has an timer so far I&#x27;m an happy customer oh this lamp works well with both gel polish &amp; gel builder</li>
    <li> This is an excellent dryer.  I purchased it because it is cheaper than some of the other brands.  It can fit one entire hand in it and had multiple time settings for drying nails. My DIY gel manis last for a 7-8 days with kids and housework.</li>
    <li> Works amazing! Came in on time. Worth every penny</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product for the past few weeks but I must admit &amp;#34;I&#x27;m Loving It&amp;#34; so far. I&#x27;ve received more compliments on my fingernails then when I was paying the nail shop to do them.  My toenails look just as good but unfortunately due to the changing weather in Missouri, only my boyfriend has been able to see them. Can&#x27;t wait to be able to show them off.  Before purchasing the USpicy, I read majority of the reviews on several machines that were rated 4 stars. Some of the better ratings were on the LED lamps but the price tags were not that impressive for me. The price and the previous reviews for this product caused me to select this one for purchasing and I extremely happy I did. I&#x27;m just a normal girl who likes to get the best product for my money and in this case....I was dead on. Everything arrived in a timely manner and in working condition. My only compliant is that the adhesive of the flooring of the unit doesn&#x27;t stick that great.</li>
    <li> I was very iffy about buying this nail dryer because I did a lot of research and most people said you get what you pay for and others said they wouldn&#x27;t pay under $200 on one. I, however, couldn&#x27;t imagine spending that much on a nail dryer so I tested my luck with this one and I&#x27;m so glad I did! This is a cheaper nail dryer and so far it has been amazing! It works perfectly. I use this with my CND gel nail products (which I was also nervous about because they tell you you need their nail dryer otherwise they can&#x27;t guarantee curing times) and this is the same wattage as the CND nail dryer. All drying times are the same and it has the convenience of the time which I love. Definitely worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE: Aug 2015*&lt;br /&gt;I am still using this nail dryer. I have been using it about every couple weeks since I got it aside for about a month. It is still going strong with the bulbs and everything. I still love it and wouldn&#x27;t change my previous review of it.</li>
    <li> This light is the best light I&#x27;ve purchased so far, and the cheapest. It arrived quickly. The free gloves came earlier than the light so that was confusing, but it&#x27;s because it was a gift. It was packaged very nicely when it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any trouble putting the lights in, they popped right in for me. And the light itself is pretty powerful. It cures gel great and quick. The timer works like a charm for me. I love that there&#x27;s a separate time start button and on/off button. It&#x27;s easy to clean because the tray slides out, I found that to be pretty nifty. It&#x27;s big and it has a nice, cute, girly look to it.&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing to complain about! If this light ever goes out, I wouldn&#x27;t think twice about ordering this same light again.</li>
    <li> AT first I thought this product sucked. But after a few more uses, this product is great. Its medium-large size...can comfortably fit your hand..both hands if you leave out the thumbs. It dries quick. I love the timer. I didn&#x27;t care about the gloves, but when they arrived I decided to try it after my third set of gels and it does make a difference. It has less burn. Great product, worth the money.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this UV nail dryer, easy to assemble and use. I did find that the lights got a bit too hot while doing my shellac, but waiting a bit between coats helped with this.</li>
    <li> The lamp is absolutely fantastic. Nice timer. Can choose between 120, 180 and none. So far it&#x27;s been worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Got my lamp last night. It worked fantastic! So easy to use...big enough for both hands...love the timer!! Awesome product very reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> Great but needs to be a little stronger bulb</li>
    <li> I am so excited about this product--no more paying 30 bucks every two weeks for a salon gel manicure! Received the package within four days of purchase and tried it for the first time last night. I bought the China Glaze &amp;#34;Gelaze&amp;#34; polish from Sally&#x27;s and my nails came out flawless. This is a great polish because it is a base and polish in one so there is no need to purchase a separate base coat. I finished with the Gelaze top coat and got so many compliments on my nails today. It is so easy to do! I deducted a star because the downfall is the lamp does not have a automatic timer to shut off the light so you have to shut it off after 2 mins (I used the timer on my phone). You can&#x27;t go wrong with this price--excited to use it again and again!</li>
    <li> It does everything I expected. Yes it takes a little while to do a full manicure but it works perfectly and my nails are as beautiful as ever!</li>
    <li> Excellent investment. Exceeded my expectations. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect for nails at home!! I read a lot  of reviews before purchasing this. Truly I was fed up with paying the prices at the salon. Starting out was equivalent to one trip to the salon but with no waiting or bad personalities and language barriers. I have used ASP and Gelish gel polish and set the timer to 180 seconds to be safe since I was using glitter, too. I have had so many compliments from even salon workers are so impresssed when I tell them I do my own nails. I can go 2-3 wks with the polish depending on my free time - not because they look bad. They just grow out!!   Fast delivery. Plenty of room and perfect fit for hands. I will not use gel on my toes but I will say if you do there is enough room for your tootsies. Love  my dryer!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I can also do my toenails with no problem.  Arrived quickly and works just as I thought.</li>
    <li> Used on the 120 sec timer setting. Worked great.</li>
    <li> My girlfriends and I always go to the nail salon for manicures and new polishes, but with this machine.... we can diy and actually have time to talk.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Very Good seller</li>
    <li> I love that it has two timer settings.  It&#x27;s also built much better and is heavier than the Shany Nail Dryer that I had to return.  The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because the lights flicker a bit when you first turn on.  Easy to insert the bulbs too and came with a free nail file and nice sturdy packaging.  Works great with Gelish.</li>
    <li> My daughter told me that this was the on she specifically wanted so she was a happy girl on Christmas morning!</li>
    <li> Pretty amazing for the price. Sometimes the light does turn off when it is moved or &amp;#34;hit&amp;#34;. But i havent had major issues with it. And ive used it several times now. Works perfect and cures the gel just fine!</li>
    <li> lo compre para mis clientas de belleza es muy rapido a comparacion de otros secadores y tiene  un precio muy comodo</li>
    <li> Just used this item this morning. Loved it. Worked exactly as it was supposed to. Came well packed and I love the gloves to protect my hands. I&#x27;ll be using this as much as I can. I want to practice gel nails on my friends.</li>
    <li> The dryer worked with our acrylic and gellish but after about six uses, it just stopped working.  Plug it in and turn it on, nothing.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m saving SO much money doing my own Gel nails now!  No more salons for me!</li>
    <li> Worked through 3 manicures, just enough to get through the warranty period, and then stopped!</li>
    <li> Good device. Very good celler.</li>
    <li> great in home lamp for gel manicure. I do wish that the timer was in smaller intervals, as some polishes require only 30 or 45 seconds, this has 120/180.  I like that it came with the gloves to protect your hands as well.  A good buy.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try gel nail polish so I reviewed tons of UV lamps. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on it since i wasn&#x27;t sure if i would like gel nail polish. This one had the best reviews for the price. I got to say it is perfect no need to buy and expensive one. Very easy to use and has a great amount of space for your hand and/or foot without having to worry about touching the side and messing up your nails. Only werid thing about it is when i unpacked it it had a layer of tape or ceranwrap or something to protect the machine from scratches during the shipment that took some time to peel off but it came off with no problems. The light bulbs just snap in easily and i have use it for 2 sets of finger nails and 1 set of toes so far perfectly. oh and i am using the gelish brand name of nail polish.</li>
    <li> I got these as a present and they arrived in less than a week via super saver shipping.  Each bulb was packaged separately and worked right out of the box.  The bulbs were easy to install and the unit was solid and clean looking.  I&#x27;ll update more once the recipient opens her present and tries it out; but, so far, so good!&lt;br /&gt;Vidimo Se!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, if you need replacement bulbs you can find them for a few dollars at Fry&#x27;s Electronics.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with instructions on how to fit the light bulbs in but it wasn&#x27;t hard, and unless you&#x27;re a completely idiot, you should be able to figure it out. I like the timer feature. I don&#x27;t think it has enough watts for the system I&#x27;m using (OPI Axxium) but I just do every set a minute longer than required, and wipe the tacky stuff off with NAS 99 and it&#x27;s good to go. Overall been very pleased!</li>
    <li> Wish it was led but that&#x27;s my fault. I wish it dried a bit faster but overall, it gets the job done fast and well!</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick &amp; the lamp works just as stated in the description.  Bought the Gelish Top and Base coat and use rubbing alcohol to wipe the stickyness.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Although it takes 2-3 minutes to cure gelish nail products, it&#x27;s well worth it as I can now get a salon manicure at home.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I ordered this, and I was a little hesitant after reading the reviews, but I went ahead and ordered it anyway. I received it fairly quickly and used it right away. It worked perfectly and I had no problems with it whatsoever. I would recommend this product to anyone. It was a great deal and works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Takes a couple times to dry nails but work better than waiting all day for nails to dry then you mess them up</li>
    <li> Thia arrived as described and works great. Put a base coat, polish and then a top coat on my toes and it set in 180 seconds. It was just regular polish not the type they recommend but it worked great.</li>
    <li> It came triple boxed.  The bulbs were already in place.  The  gloves and  emery board  were included. It works well and and large enough for one hand.  I made the right choice.</li>
    <li> Nice size machine for your whole hand comfortably. Love the protective gloves included.</li>
    <li> Not bad!  Worked just as expected. Really helped the layers of polish dry when doing nail art.</li>
    <li> got as a christmas gift for a friend ans she loves it for her daily nail art and design she does</li>
    <li> When my nail tech went up to $35 per visit I realized I would be spending $70 per month to keep nails looking good.  Bought this and have already saved several hundred dollars</li>
    <li> So far have used it once and it worked great. Set up was simple and like that it came with gloves to protect hands. Timer worked perfect. Happy with price and quality.</li>
    <li> I received my second Lamp from this Buyer and I must say...they have the BEST customer service. They are very reliable and appreciate their customers.  The lamp works like a charm. Very Good product!</li>
    <li> I have used it once so far, and it seems to work great.  I like that you received&lt;br /&gt;gloves to protect your hands and also that it has a timer with two settings...2 minutes and three minutes.</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great, it&#x27;s what I expected. Very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This UV light is great.  Use it with CND shellac polish.  Followed drying times from CND website for their shellac colours and works great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine almost two years and it still works perfectly. The width of the dryer fits one hand well, which is fine if you do your own nails and cure one hand at a time. With much practice,  I now polish both hands and then overlap to cure at the same time.  That&#x27;s when the slide out tray comes in handy to avoid smudges.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product, and at ~$50, it pays for itself in the first two uses vs. the salon cost.</li>
    <li> I have to leave my hands in longer than recommended to ensure my manicure lasts. Use sunscreen on your hands to avoid damage from the UV Rays.</li>
    <li> I called her she loves this stuff,  Heres 13 more words when I fish for walleyes, what I use is..........</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat this for the price.  I almost bought the OPI UV lamp but the price was too steep so I decided on this one after reading several reviews.  I used it with OPI gel polish and it dried them perfectly!</li>
    <li> Product works great. Love how fast it takes to do my nails after doing complicated themes its nice to only need a few minutes for drying.</li>
    <li> I recently started to do my own nails to save money on manicure after a bad experience with a nail salon. Making a long story short, I paid almost 60 dollars for a shellac gel manicure with a tip extension only to have them break off the very next day. From my research, many uv lamp were between 25-60 dollars. I purchased a UV lamp from amazon but when I received it, it would not turn on, so I got a refund and bought this one instead. Best decision and for a reasonable price. I opted for the Super saver shipping and received it a week before the estimated delivery date (I currently live in Okinawa). I  highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works great! Love the option of 2mins or 3mins</li>
    <li> my girl friend loves this !</li>
    <li> It works just as described.  Love the timer setting.  I&#x27;ve had it for 1 month and so far still running strong.</li>
    <li> Great buy for the price work very well.</li>
    <li> Mine came with the bulbs already installed. It works like a dream though the black of fans makes the interior quite warm by the end of the 180sec setting. It cured the polish perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if the controls were on top though. Doing your own nails its odd to have it on the back but it didn&#x27;t keep me from using it.</li>
    <li> Works just like the ones used in nail salons. I love that this comes with UV protector gloves.</li>
    <li> Well, at first I thought it was default - this is my first experience with home gel manicures.  But, after going on line and looking for directions, I realized that ALL gel manicures are a bit tacky and that one is supposed to rub them (after the final coat and set) with alcohol and cotton or paper towel.  Once I learned this trick, I realized the dryer is working properly.  I love the timer as I generally do my nails in front of a good program and I don&#x27;t need to time, the light will jus go off.  I didn&#x27;t really like the gloves - they were a bit uncomfortable for me, but I don&#x27;t know as they are really necessary.  I was VERY pleased with the unit.</li>
    <li> LOVE! I am so happy we bought this. My daughter and I used it for the first time today. Our nails turned out just as wonderful as in the salon. Just make sure you follow the instructions or the instructions on  your prep kit for the brand of polish you buy. I love this! I am SO happy we bought it!!! Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt;Paid for itself in a few gel nail jobs ....&lt;br /&gt;We will see how long it last bulb wise!</li>
    <li> Works like a pro... Has a timer as saves me so much money I don&#x27;t have to spend at a salon</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teen daughter for Christmas and she has used it about once a week since then.  She loves it!  Very happy with the timer&#x27;s ease of use and overall quality.  I used other suggestions to go for the slightly more expensive one and could not be happier.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh I could not rave more about this light. GREAT quality for the price. Cures everything well, very happy with my purchase. If you&#x27;re thinking about getting a UV light, stop looking and get this one! I&#x27;ve used OPI lights with lower watts that feel cheaper than this one but cost 3x more.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Like it!</li>
    <li> Works as expected.  No problems</li>
    <li> I plugged it in, turned it on and nothing happened. It did not work.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves it. More then I expected. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Best UV ever. I&#x27;ve had this now for over a year and still have not had to replace the bulbs. I do my friends to my mother&#x27;s nails as well as my own and it works GREAT! Awesome product. I do my nails about once every 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!! So easy to use, and does a great job.</li>
    <li> Work for me!  I&#x27;ve never done gel nails.  I was a little intimidated at first, but it&#x27;s really pretty easy.  Day number four and nails haven&#x27;t chipped at all.  I just asked my daughter how she does it and followed her advice.  Buff, base coat, color gel 2 coats, top coat.  Two minutes drying time for each coat.  Lamp works as promised.</li>
    <li> I really like this light.  It works very well.  I would order it again.  It is really nice that all five fingers fit in at one time...a time saver!</li>
    <li> el producto no funciona exijo reembolso del dinero. . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use!</li>
    <li> when I ordered this, I did not realize that the bulbs had to be changed every 6 months.  Would have preferred LED lights.</li>
    <li> I received the product in two days and I didn&#x27;t pay for shipping. It was packaged very well. Arrived in perfect condition. Works great! and it&#x27;s large enough for me to put both of my hands in - provided I do so carefully so I don&#x27;t smudge a nail. It&#x27;s lightweight and very easy to use. I like it better than the LED one I bought and returned from a local retailer. UV seems to give a better cure than LED....but that could be a polish thing.</li>
