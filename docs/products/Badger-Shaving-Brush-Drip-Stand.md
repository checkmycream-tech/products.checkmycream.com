      <li>Looks great, but it is too short to fit my shaving brush, a normal sized tweezerman badger.</li>
      <li>I wont say that it is super elegant but a decent value for money.</li>
      <li>works fine but is very overpriced</li>
      <li>Works as expected, just a piece of plastic with a good cutout.</li>
      <li>Price is well worth</li>
      <li>Nice, simple, works well.  </li>
      <li>Very good looking and economic, although this stand is for small to medium brushes</li>
      <li>The price is right though, and it gets the job done.</li>
      <li>Brush dries better than when I used to put it upside down or on side, and the brush bristles are not smashed anymore, so it is worthwhile to have this drip stand.  </li>

      <li>but I&#x27;ve seen similar for lots more</li>
      <li>It is exactly as you would expect it to be.</li>

      <li>Does not look like much</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap and simple.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t looking to spend too much on a brush stand.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on some fancy pants stand that would take up too much space in my cabinet, this fits the bill.</li>
      <li>Since I bought this when I first Began wet shaving, I was just looking for something cheap and efficient.</li>
      <li>Simple to keep clean.</li>
      <li>classy and modern look works well with my Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush.</li>
      <li>This shaving brush holder is not big enough to hold most brushes.  </li>
      <li>Quality was decent, but I returned it.</li>
      <li>Luckily, it has a screw hole in the back</li>
      <li>Item was new and just as described.</li>
      <li>Its a bit smaller than I expected, but holds a brush well, and actually is better smaller, doesn&#x27;t take up much space; and isn&#x27;t as top heavy as I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>It is a pretty simple device so it either works or it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Not bad, shorter than expected</li>
      <li>Simple and clean design to hold brush inverted to dry and hold shape.</li>
      <li>Not big enough to fit my standard size Perfecto brush.</li>
      <li>I will probably want to buy a nicer brush and shaver stand in the future, but I just can&#x27;t believe how much companies want to charge for them...</li>
      <li>Not amazing quality, but it sure does get the job done.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Good stand, fits perfectly</li>
    <li> This shaving brush holder is not big enough to hold most brushes.  It puts pressure on your knot which is a huge no no.  It would work for something small but definitely will not work for something like an Omega, Proraso, or others of the like.  Quality was decent, but I returned it.</li>
    <li> The stand does exactly what it is supposed to and for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Looks just like the photo. Basic stand perfect for keeping in the medicine cabinet. Husband has been using it since Christmas with no problems and It fits the WSP badger brush I got him as well. I will probably want to buy a nicer brush and shaver stand in the future, but I just can&#x27;t believe how much companies want to charge for them... Thanks for a nice, cheap solution.</li>
    <li> Fantastic stand for the common Joe. Since I bought this when I first Began wet shaving, I was just looking for something cheap and efficient. THAT is excactku what I got. Price is well worth the use you get out of it. If you want something fancy with bells and whistles, look elsewhere. BUT if you want an inexpensive stand that does it&#x27;s job, THIS is the stand for you!</li>
    <li> Simple and does the job</li>
    <li> Very good looking and economic, although this stand is for small to medium brushes</li>
    <li> Cheap and lightweight but for the price it works.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a black piece of plastic that holds your brush off the counter.</li>
    <li> In Amazon&#x27;s product-satisfaction rating system, 5-Stars equates to &amp;#34;I Love It!&amp;#34;  Frankly, it&#x27;s hard to &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; a little plastic device that holds a shaving brush.  But I do think the combination of good design, sturdy manufacture, and low price, qualify this simple item as a 5-Star purchase.  It looks good, low-key.  It fits my Simply Beautiful Basic Badger Shaving Brush perfectly, and it just sits there quietly and dries the brush between uses.  That&#x27;s what I expected, and is exactly what I got.</li>
    <li> As described. Nothing fancy, but performs well.</li>
    <li> Very handy...helps to cut down on bathroom sink clutter.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Looks ugly and cheap, but I keep it in my shower so who cares.  Brush dries better than when I used to put it upside down or on side, and the brush bristles are not smashed anymore, so it is worthwhile to have this drip stand.  Not for display, but perfect if you just want something the works well.</li>
    <li> This is a nice inexpensive stand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cheap plastic brush stand, works as advertised!</li>
    <li> Does not look like much but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Not big enough to fit my standard size Perfecto brush.</li>
    <li> Simple, and I like the wall mount option. Haven&#x27;t had a problem with it</li>
    <li> It does it job.  I use it for business travel.  Would recommended the metal one if you have a shaver as well.</li>
    <li> It holds my brush just fine.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on some fancy pants stand that would take up too much space in my cabinet, this fits the bill.</li>
    <li> Looks great, but it is too short to fit my shaving brush, a normal sized tweezerman badger. Luckily, it has a screw hole in the back so I mounted it upside down to the wall and rest my razor on the little shelf the bottom makes.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Not for larger brushes.</li>
    <li> This was much smaller than I thought it would be. Its cheap and it works though but that&#x27;s about all. For style it has none but I&#x27;ve seen similar for lots more so I still think it is a good deal.</li>
    <li> Simple and clean design to hold brush inverted to dry and hold shape.</li>
    <li> I wanted to maximize the life of my brush by letting it dry bristle down, but don&#x27;t have the counter space or desire for a pretty chrome stand.  This stand sits on my shelf just fine and I can screw it to the wall if I need that shelf space later.</li>
    <li> I mean, it&#x27;s a brush stand. It does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. It was new and it matched the other products I bought with it. I think it fits most brushes. I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>
    <li> Bought this on a chance. It would be nice if it was taller and the opening for the brush was larger.&lt;br /&gt;Not a bad unit, but I could. DIY a nicer one to fit my needs.</li>
    <li> Nice little stand, does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  I haven&#x27;t mounted it to my wall, just stand it on the counter.</li>
    <li> Nice, simple, works well.  Good value.</li>
    <li> Great stand, helps to hold my shaving brush to ensure it lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t have the bristles fall out due to the glue coming unstuck from water.</li>
    <li> Use it with [[ASIN:B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]] and it works well as a drip stand. It is plastic but doesn&#x27;t really look very cheap. I wont say that it is super elegant but a decent value for money. It can be mounted on wall but i prefer to keep it on the counter as the stability ca be questioned otherwise.</li>
    <li> works fine but is very overpriced</li>
    <li> Holds my shaving brush perfectly and was cheap. Nothing special but does the job.</li>
    <li> This does ok. Brush is hard to snap in it but it does get the job done</li>
    <li> This is a good little stand for the money you cant go wrong with it. Would diffidently recommend.it has a screw hole if you want to mount it to the wall to keep it off the counter.</li>
    <li> This is a good little brush holder.  No frills.  Nothing to show off.  But it does what it needs to do, hold your shaving brush.  The base is wide enough that even a wet brush will not cause it to topple over.  The notch holds my brush securely in place.  For those who do not use a stand, allowing your shaving brush to air dry, in this position (bristles down), improves the performance and lifespan of your brush.  If you use a shaving brush, you need a stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in my travel kit, because it weighs next to nothing and packs easily.</li>
    <li> Looks good. It&#x27;s nice to have somewhere to hang the brush but I am not sure it improves the quality of the brush. It&#x27;s also a little short. I would recommend a taller stand.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap and simple.  Be aware that it will probably not hold brushes with large diameter handles.  It fits my tweezerman perfectly, but any larger won&#x27;t fit (tested it with a van der hagen plastic brush, no dice).  Also if your brush has substantial bloom, like the tweezerman, a portion will be in contact with the back plate.  It does hold well though, looks nice and the plastic is well cut.</li>
    <li> Simple and elegant.  This little stand does not take away from the beauty of the brush design.  Simple to keep clean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not much, just a piece of plastic, but it holds my brush in the correct position when not in use so that it keeps it&#x27;s shape while drying &amp; that&#x27;s what counts.</li>
    <li> Works as expected, just a piece of plastic with a good cutout.</li>
    <li> very good Handy good Service</li>
    <li> Did not fit my brush. Sucks, Sucks, Sucks sucks. There is not way to get in touch with someone to return this item that I will not be able to use.</li>
    <li> Item was available for Prime. This is always a plus! My hubs is Military and we got stationed in the Country. I swear by Prime these days. Great price. Great quality. Item was new and just as described.</li>
    <li> Not amazing quality, but it sure does get the job done.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking to spend too much on a brush stand. This works perfectly! Holds a perfecto brush nicely!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend is new to wet shaving. Since we weren&#x27;t sure if he would like it, I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much money in it. This stand fits the perfecto 100% badger brush that I bought him to start out with. It is plastic. It is not the most attractive stand in the world. I will probably get a different one eventually. The price is right though, and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This stand is simple and elegant and a excellent value for money. It is very easy to slide a brush in and out. My only wish was that they could have added 1 cm to the height so that the gap between brush top and the base could be little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from that a thoroughly recommended item</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my brush. Looks O.K.</li>
    <li> Piece of plastic that does its job wonderfully.</li>
    <li> classy and modern look works well with my Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Simple!  THE RIGHT PRICE!</li>
    <li> It does the job of holding the brush but tips over easily.</li>
    <li> Expensive but good.  I&#x27;d rate it 5 stars if the cost was lower.</li>
    <li> Does what it is suppose to do. elite Brush fit when I hung it right above the bristles.</li>
    <li> stand broke.The 2time i inserted the brush,i bought from vander hagen. The plastic is ment to hold smaller diameter brushes, perhaps like, omega, scali ,prorazo.</li>
    <li> smaller than i thought it would be</li>
    <li> helps my brush dry, small enough to fit in my medicine cabinet. great buy</li>
    <li> I like this stand fits my perfecto and tweezerman brushs fine...and black goes with everything...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m afraid this will break if I pack it inappropriately in a bag, but other than that, it does the job and looks sleek enough for my income level.</li>
    <li> Bought this to hold my shaving brush up off the counter.  It does a great job and is easy to mount to the wall.  It is a pretty simple device so it either works or it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I put my hubby&#x27;s shaving brush in it...had to snap it in place. When he went to take it out &amp; shave, it broke the brissles off the handle! I don&#x27;t know if the type of brush he has is different than what should be used with this. but now he isn&#x27;t using it because it broke his brush. Thank God we had Gorilla glue to put his brush back together.</li>
    <li> It is exactly as you would expect it to be. Perfect.</li>
    <li> just what I needed for my badger brush</li>
    <li> It does the job. It is much smaller than I had expected and the brush doesn&#x27;t sit in there correctly. But it does the job and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Great stand! Very inexpensive way to ensure my expensive brushes last a long time.</li>
    <li> It looks and works as it should.  A bit over-priced, but it seems all of these are--you&#x27;d really have to shop and wait for one to be offered at a more appropriate clearance price or make your own to do any better.</li>
    <li> Good stand for your traveling toiletry bag.</li>
    <li> Its a bit smaller than I expected, but holds a brush well, and actually is better smaller, doesn&#x27;t take up much space; and isn&#x27;t as top heavy as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Holds two of my different brushes well and is lightweight for travel use.</li>
    <li> It is shorter than it looks in the picture, but I was able to make it work with my large brush.</li>
    <li> Good stand for the price</li>
    <li> Does what its supposed to do and its cheap. Pretty good combo if you ask me.</li>
    <li> Not bad, shorter than expected</li>
    <li> Good quality for a low price. Stand works well and looks good (even better than the photo).  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Both my badger brushes fit perfectly in this stand</li>
    <li> The stand works just fine. The opening is small for the brush I ended up purchasing. It&#x27;s a great step while I decide what direction I&#x27;m going to go with the setup. If the brush had fit I probably wouldn&#x27;t change a thing.</li>
