    <li> Great product I can&#x27;t see the difference after ironing for2 weeks</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, makes my skin look clear, healthy and fresh. The lines on my forehead have definately reduced.&lt;br /&gt;Will not use anything else from now on!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.. Quick shipment, couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> So far (1 week), my skin looks and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon the first two days of use, I had some red irritation on my cheeks, under my eyes, but that has since subsided. My skin is now perfectly clear and I feel like the fine lines under my eyes have already faded a little. I do sometimes get a slight sting when I apply my primer after the Hydrafactor moisturizer, but I&#x27;m not worried about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other day when I washed my make up off, I almost couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between my skin with makeup on and without it. It&#x27;s already making my skin look more alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite amazed at how quickly this product has already worked... I think I&#x27;ll be using it for quite a long time if it keeps producing results like this!</li>
    <li> Love love love it! Excellent</li>
    <li> Not for me it didn&#x27;t clear my skin</li>
    <li> Used for 2 months and did not help breakouts at all! I am now using Clarity Clear Skin Essentials and love it! It cleared up my skin within a week and healing my scars.</li>
    <li> Formerly used Obagi NuDerm, decided to try their new line 360. Its been 2 weeks and the stuff works miracles for my complexion more so. However, remember that each person&#x27;s skin is different so what may work for some may not work for others</li>
    <li> This obagi treatment is amazing, if used routinely you will, with out a doubt see a difference! It is a great deal, you get a full treatment for one small price!</li>
    <li> I have never had such wonderful skincare products before! My freckles &amp; wrinkles have faded a bit. I&#x27;m also not breaking out as much! The smell of the products is wonderful. The only drawback is their is an adjusting period with the Retin A (for wrinkles) product. My skin got so dry, &amp; I was about to give up....but after a week &amp; a 1/2 it adjusted! I have added an extra moisterizer in addition to the SPF product it comes with to maintain soft skin.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best skin care line for every type of skin.</li>
    <li> This system is amazing!  Within one day of use I can tell a difference in my skin. It is so soft and looks healthy. This system is intended to repair skin and reduce wrinkles, not to treat acne. Obagi does sell a kit specifically for acne that is also amazing, it is the Clenziderm.</li>
    <li> This is the best skincare I have ever used!! It truly made a difference in my skin! My skin is soft, smooth, clear and looks young! No more ruddy look and my discoloration is gone!</li>
    <li> I love Obaji and this product doesn&#x27;t live up to previous Obaji lines I have used. I really like the way it feels, however I have seen zero improvements in my skin since using it (almost gone). I think it&#x27;s a good place to start because everyone is different. My skin is really oily with brown spots and lines in between my eye brows and eyes and this did not improve my skin.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product for my niece and she loves it.  Best thing she has ever used on her face.  Her skin looks clear and radiant.  Excellent product and price was great on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product, really worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Obagi 360 for over a month and have yet to see results. I have combination skin and have really not seeing any results. Unfortunate I&#x27;ve been disappointed</li>
    <li> I &#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Amazing really makes a dramatic diffrence large pores are getting smaller ,  darkness round eyes lifting also fine lines and wrinkles are wayyyy reduced , remember you gotta go through ugly to get to gorjus had lots of drying and flaking skin but I didn&#x27;t mind I knew the product was amazing thank youuuu xxx</li>
    <li> Okay, so first let me start off my saying that I am 25 years old and for the last two years I have been searching for the best skincare that is available. In the process I have spent a small fortune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, with my forehead  being the driest and most problematic area. I have bought all sort of moisturizers to combat this and all of them have required multiple applications throughout the day; on top of that, I never really saw any results with any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still only about a week into using this system so only time will tell if this is real love but so far so good ! My forehead is a lot smoother and it stays moisturized all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I apply the retinol I wait about 20 mins and I pat on loreals youth code texture perfecter moisturizer on top before I go to bed and it really works for me.</li>
    <li> First time buying this product and was effy it would be the genuine product or past the expiration date, I decided to give it a try anyways. I was completely happy and 100% satisfied with the overall product. I will no longer buy this from my esthetician. Thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been blessed with decent skin. Acne has never been a problem until the birth of my daughter. Now that she&#x27;s weaned I decided to devote more time to a more rigorous skin care regimen. I couldn&#x27;t be happier! It&#x27;s a total of two steps twice daily. My skin has NEVER looked or felt better.</li>
    <li> If you care about your skin, do not purchase this product. I am a fan of Obagi, however, this line of products broke my skin out worst than ever before. I&#x27;m not sure if this product was altered by the company that sells it, but my skin broke out into tiny red bumps all over my face. I was skeptical seeing how it was being sold for $70 when it retails for $150 but I proceeded to purchase anyway. This was the worst decision. I&#x27;m a 23 year old female and I have been using for 3 months. I am having to go to a dermatologist to help clear my skin. STAY away!</li>
    <li> The scrub is really amazing. I wish I started using this product when I was younger.</li>
