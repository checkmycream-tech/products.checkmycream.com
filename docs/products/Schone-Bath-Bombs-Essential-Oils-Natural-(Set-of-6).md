      <li>Anyways these smell amazing and leave a nice light oil on your skin.</li>
      <li>Perfect for a relaxing evening, and I love that the ingredients are all virtually all natural.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re okay, interesting scents.  </li>
      <li>and I love them.</li>
      <li>These are just ok.</li>

      <li>Great value, lasting scent, silky feel.</li>
      <li>The dont fizz very much and they smell just ok.</li>
      <li>[[VIDEOID:21bbbc9374e67f807966d4e88d7f02a9]]Until I tried my first bath bomb I was not quite sure why it was called a Bath Bomb</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t what I expected, but still great to soak in.</li>
      <li>Some of the colors, like the blue you see in the video, are so bright that I was worried it would stain the tub and the shower curtain</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t have quite as much moisturizing effect, and the scents are a littel more earthy.</li>
      <li>There is a bit of foaming as the bomb fizzes and then the foam quickly disappears.</li>
      <li>Getting a free product does not effect what I say, the review is based purely on my experience with the product.</li>
      <li>I had purchased a big bath bomb in a cute seaside beach town local store and I loved it.</li>
      <li>She said it fizzed just the right amount and the water color was pretty as well.</li>
      <li>Excellent alternative to Lush bath bombs, but add a little baby oil to the water if you want it to feel like it came from Lush.</li>
      <li>So I bought these to have more and they were not the same.</li>
      <li>Some of Schone bombs produce pretty intense color.  </li>
      <li>these are amazing but a little over priced</li>
      <li>I have used the name brand ones but these are very comparable.</li>
      <li>These came fast not broken</li>
      <li>These bath bombs are ok, but they are small, and they aren&#x27;t as effective as the larger bath bombs that Lush makes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;We have used almost all other bath bombs available on Amazon, and we think this is the winner!</li>
      <li>All the scents she received were lovely, and while these were smaller than we expected, they&#x27;re really powerful.</li>
      <li>I thought they would be a little bit more vivid.</li>
      <li>My skin felt soft and moisturized after bathing with one of these.</li>
      <li>I bought this after trying Lush&#x27;s bath bombs.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;d highly recommend these, and if we purchase bath bombs in the future we&#x27;ll definitely purchase these</li>
      <li>They were very fragrant and the scent was long lasting.</li>
      <li>If I had a choice again, I would just buy the more expensive and larger Lush bath bombs and skip buying these.</li>

    <li> I purchased these for my daughter. She loves the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; store bath bombs, but they&#x27;re so expensive that we decided to give these a try. We&#x27;re so glad we did! All the scents she received were lovely, and while these were smaller than we expected, they&#x27;re really powerful. You could smell the scent throughout the house (in a GOOD way!) and I could still smell it on my daughter and in the bathroom the next day as well, so the scents are long lasting also. She said it fizzed just the right amount and the water color was pretty as well. We&#x27;d highly recommend these, and if we purchase bath bombs in the future we&#x27;ll definitely purchase these again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Also, they arrived a day sooner than the shipping estimate, so that was a great surprise as well.)</li>
    <li> These were a gift for my anniversary. They smell wonderful, are super fizzy, and leave no mess in the tub.</li>
    <li> I got these as a gift for my birthday and I love them. I have used the name brand ones but these are very comparable. They turn your whole bath a nice pastel color as well as giving off a lovely aroma.</li>
    <li> these are amazing but a little over priced</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected, but still great to soak in. Smells great,and I&#x27;d think I&#x27;d buy it again ..</li>
    <li> These are just ok. I had purchased a big bath bomb in a cute seaside beach town local store and I loved it. So I bought these to have more and they were not the same. The dont fizz very much and they smell just ok.</li>
    <li> These bath bombs are great! They are a nice size, brightly colorful and smell fantatic. They were exactly as expected for me. They are the  typical size for a bath bomb. They were very fragrant and the scent was long lasting. They provided the perfect amount of fizz. My skin felt soft and moisturized after bathing with one of these. I like the egg like container that they come in, very handy. *sample provided to review</li>
    <li> The bath bombs were awesome! They have a great smell and makes you smell amazing after a good hot bath. The only thing is they were oily but I still loved them.</li>
    <li> Great value, lasting scent, silky feel. Wonderful for a warm relaxing winter bath. Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Smelled so good. Great price. The bombs are small.</li>
    <li> I bought these because they were a great price, most bath bombs are up to $10  for one! Anyways these smell amazing and leave a nice light oil on your skin. The scent last a long time on your skin. These came fast not broken I would def. Buy these again and for gifts!!</li>
    <li> I bought this after trying Lush&#x27;s bath bombs. These bath bombs are ok, but they are small, and they aren&#x27;t as effective as the larger bath bombs that Lush makes. If I had a choice again, I would just buy the more expensive and larger Lush bath bombs and skip buying these.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love them! They smell amazing! Definitely would buy again.</li>
    <li> Bath Bliss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I used it last night. What a luxurious experience. Transformed our tub into the Taj Mahal with its scents and colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have used almost all other bath bombs available on Amazon, and we think this is the winner!</li>
    <li> I got these as a gift for my fiancee and she loves them</li>
    <li> Not very happy when they came in! They where very small and it took 2 to make the water purple .. 😒 they made the mail box smell great but the smell didn&#x27;t last. I thought they would be a little bit more vivid. 😒</li>
    <li> These are fantastic. I use one &amp;#34;ball&amp;#34; per bath, and it gives the bath a warm color, refreshing scent and gives me a soothing feeling. Perfect for a relaxing evening, and I love that the ingredients are all virtually all natural.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re okay, interesting scents.  Not quite as nice as Rejuvenelle bath bombs, but much less expensive.  They don&#x27;t have quite as much moisturizing effect, and the scents are a littel more earthy.</li>
    <li> The product was just as described and my husband lived them</li>
    <li> These are amazing if you love luxurious baths. Excellent alternative to Lush bath bombs, but add a little baby oil to the water if you want it to feel like it came from Lush.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:21bbbc9374e67f807966d4e88d7f02a9]]Until I tried my first bath bomb I was not quite sure why it was called a Bath Bomb... I took a video and you can see that it fizzes like an explosion.  The scent seemed very strong until I put into the water and as it dissolved it was just right. Each bomb is a one time use product, the entire bomb fizzes away in about 2 minutes leaving the scented water infused with a moisturiser. I now tried a couple of different bath bombs, some generate bubbles like bubble bath but Schone bombs do not. There is a bit of foaming as the bomb fizzes and then the foam quickly disappears. Some of Schone bombs produce pretty intense color.  Some of the colors, like the blue you see in the video, are so bright that I was worried it would stain the tub and the shower curtain but the color does not stain! Whew! The Schone balls are a little smaller than some others I have tried, but I did not think the size mattered. Overall a very pleasant and relaxing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bath bomb is provided by Schone for testing and review. Getting a free product does not effect what I say, the review is based purely on my experience with the product. From my history you can see that I leave 1 star reviews as well as 5 star reviews, I always try to be fair and honest, include pros and cons as well as video/photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
