    <li> .5ml bottles.....these are not average size they are MUCH smaller.  I LOVE this brand but truly expected more polish... I thought I was getting a deal however based on the size it&#x27;s not much of  a deal.  Regardless the colors are nice and I still like the brand... polish stays on much longer and looks much nicer than other brands...</li>

    <li> This is the true &amp;#34;Fantastic Four&amp;#34;! Every color is a true winner here. 3 of 4 are rich, deep fall to winter colors and the 4th is a perfect neutral on its own or as an alternative french tip on any of the other colors. This makes a perfect stocking stuffer for the girls at work!</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, long lasting polish. It looks professionally done. One of the best nail polish brands out there.</li>

    <li> Best nail polish out there.</li>
    <li> I love the colors, but the brushes get stuck in the bottle when I go to open them. The polish is also becoming thicker and thicker each time I paint my nails. I prefer buying the regular size bottles.</li>
