      <li>Love the beach images.</li>
      <li>I love these plates..</li>

      <li>The designs are cute and the overall size of the full size stamps are great.  </li>
      <li>Fun plate, many designs to choose from, all coordinating, well made, and easy to use, And extremely fun, what more could a girl ask for ?&lt;</li>

      <li>super easy to use.</li>

      <li>Good product, fun to use, shipping was faster than expected which is even better.</li>
      <li>oh and the star fish full nail image.</li>
      <li>Overall a good product.</li>
      <li>This plate is exactly what you&#x27;d expect from Cheeky!</li>
      <li>Definitely a fun holiday plate.</li>
      <li>The designs inside the full size nail image should be smaller and repeat more often.</li>
      <li>These full nail images are as large as Cheeky&#x27;s Jumbo Plates..</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure at first, I didn&#x27;t think they were etched enough or deep enough-but I am new to stamping and they are great.</li>
      <li>The first one is unusable.....</li>
      <li>Will definitely get more plates.</li>
      <li>make the metal plate very sturdy!  </li>
      <li>These images are rather large - and I reckon they should be since it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Such a shame b/c there would be a lot of good designs on this plate if they were only smaller within the full size stamps.  </li>
      <li>so it might not cover a whole thumb.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these Plates!</li>
      <li>There are a couple that don&#x27;t seem to work if you are using thin polish, but that is true of most stamping plates I&#x27;ve ever bought anywhere!  </li>
      <li>For example in the \\&quot;fizzy lemon/lime wedge\\&quot; design the wedges are so big you can only fit one on your nail, so you don&#x27;t get the full image transferred.</li>
      <li>The designs that make up the full sized nail stamps are definitely too big to fit on my fingernails correctly.</li>
      <li>It bends easily on the corners making the designs located on the corners a bit harder tobwork with.</li>
      <li>A Not so fast drying one would be lovely but which nail polish brand in this day and age that takes long to dry?</li>
      <li>These are great stamps - cute designs and larger than the average design, which means no more empty gaps on my thicker thumb nails!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just lovely only down side</li>
      <li>A lot of the single designs border on being too big to fit on your nail completely.</li>
      <li>large specific designs.</li>
      <li>The full size nail designs measure a bit over 1/2 inch across and 3/4 inch up &amp; down.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used this one extensively yet, but the images I&#x27;ve used so far have stamped well.  </li>
      <li>Cheeky said they would replace it, but nearly 3 months later I still have not received the plate.  </li>
      <li>Wow, these designs are so different...</li>
      <li>Only very minor thing is, two images on the left(butterflies and sea shells) aren&#x27;t a complete square</li>

    <li> I just received the Tropical Holiday plate.  The designs are cute and the overall size of the full size stamps are great.  A lot of the single designs border on being too big to fit on your nail completely. The designs that make up the full sized nail stamps are definitely too big to fit on my fingernails correctly. The designs inside the full size nail image should be smaller and repeat more often. For example in the \\&quot;fizzy lemon/lime wedge\\&quot; design the wedges are so big you can only fit one on your nail, so you don&#x27;t get the full image transferred. The full size nail designs measure a bit over 1/2 inch across and 3/4 inch up &amp; down. Such a shame b/c there would be a lot of good designs on this plate if they were only smaller within the full size stamps.  Also, the plates took 18 days to get to me and now if I want to return them for a refund I have to pay for return shipping ($12.75) back to China to get a $20 refund.  So looks like I have to try and sell it myself to recoup my money or just take a loss.  I haven&#x27;t used these for stamping yet as I thought I would return them, so I can&#x27;t speak to how well they stamp or the engraving quality.</li>
    <li> All of Cheeky&#x27;s plates that I have ever ordered are of a good quality.  Haven&#x27;t used this one extensively yet, but the images I&#x27;ve used so far have stamped well.  There are a couple that don&#x27;t seem to work if you are using thin polish, but that is true of most stamping plates I&#x27;ve ever bought anywhere!  Overall a good product.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, works great!</li>
    <li> I love these. They are such fun and happy images. I love that you can use these for anyone going on a vacation. And you can use them to for anyone that wants to have some summer nails in the cold winter months. Very cool images.</li>
    <li> i love this plates .. the images are great to stamp so far i have not had any problem with it . you can crate a lot of styles. i just love it..</li>
    <li> Great quality plate and stamps perfect! Love the beach images. Only very minor thing is, two images on the left(butterflies and sea shells) aren&#x27;t a complete square so it might not cover a whole thumb.</li>
    <li> I love this plate and use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Lots of fun travel images and great larger images for toes! Quick and easy to use. Great addition to my collection- though i still like my mash plates better.</li>
    <li> Great designs, works very well.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Wish plate was a bit thicker. It bends easily on the corners making the designs located on the corners a bit harder tobwork with.</li>
    <li> I love this plate the images are big enough to cover my entire nail and the etching is deep enough so that the entire image is picked up</li>
    <li> Patterns are bigger than konad brand but work well</li>
    <li> Wow, these designs are so different...no carbon copies here. Fun plate, many designs to choose from, all coordinating, well made, and easy to use, And extremely fun, what more could a girl ask for ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Teresa Alstott</li>
    <li> This is a great Nail art stamping plate- images are nice size-fill whole nail for the pattern designs-there are a lot of images to choose from- transfer is excellent to nail- easy storage and I love the plaid acrylic backing- make the metal plate very sturdy!  Shipping was well packaged and arrived in 2 wks from Asia.</li>
    <li> it was a simple to use product. super easy to use. it is just what it describes. large specific designs.</li>
    <li> What can I say....Cheeky did it again.  Great plate, beautifully etched...stamps great. This plate is exactly what you&#x27;d expect from Cheeky!</li>
    <li> This is a good plate. The images are engraved deeply enough and it has a great variety of images. I do kind of wish the plaid around the edges did not come off so easily because when you use acetone it eats away at it. Either give the image more staying power or get rid of the coloring. Of course this does not affect the usefulness of the plate, but I like for my collection to look nice. These images are rather large - and I reckon they should be since it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; plate.</li>
    <li> Love these! Nice size images and a truly jumbo sized plate...</li>
    <li> I love, love it. It&#x27;s just lovely only down side is I forgot to order a nail stamper along with it. But I&#x27;m waiting patiently from the same company to get the stamper. Konad is okay but this is cheaper and works just as good as konad.The designs are awesome. Another downside is not about the product but it&#x27;s about the nail polish I am using. You need a nice smooth nail polish to get going. A Not so fast drying one would be lovely but which nail polish brand in this day and age that takes long to dry?</li>
    <li> These are great stamps - cute designs and larger than the average design, which means no more empty gaps on my thicker thumb nails!</li>
    <li> The plate was received damaged /seriously bent up.  Cheeky said they would replace it, but nearly 3 months later I still have not received the plate.  The first one is unusable.....so I wasted my money if I never receive the replacement.</li>
    <li> I love the tropical designs, really happy with this plate. I love the sea shell images, oh and the star fish full nail image. Definitely a fun holiday plate.</li>
    <li> I love these plates.. They stamp flawlessly. Great Quality. So many images one 1 plate. These full nail images are as large as Cheeky&#x27;s Jumbo Plates.. A-B-C- etc.. &lt;3 how each plate has it&#x27;s own theme. I highly recommend these Plates!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m finding that I&#x27;m using this plate alot. Really great designs. Seashells and starfish are soooo cute. My clients love them Did anyone happen to notice the two designs on the bottom left? Malaysia and an airplane. Yikes. Prophetic.</li>
    <li> Great designs and large enough designs for easy stamping.</li>
    <li> Good product, fun to use, shipping was faster than expected which is even better.</li>
    <li> The plates are great! Wasn&#x27;t sure at first, I didn&#x27;t think they were etched enough or deep enough-but I am new to stamping and they are great. From what I can see stamping definitely has to do do with the polish you use! Will definitely get more plates.</li>
    <li> Great quality, just what I wanted!</li>
