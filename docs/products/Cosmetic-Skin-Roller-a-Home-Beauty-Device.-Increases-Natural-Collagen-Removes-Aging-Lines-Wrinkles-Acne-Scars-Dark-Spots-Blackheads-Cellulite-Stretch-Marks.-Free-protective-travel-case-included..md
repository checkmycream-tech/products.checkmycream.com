      <li>&#x27;s kind that I have used</li>
      <li>Excellent packaging very sturdy item did not irritate at all using on arms and legs.</li>

      <li>I should also mention that I am 41, however, my daughter who is 18 also uses a Derma Roller and has great success as well!</li>
      <li>However, I can say that the product itself does work, seems durable, and it is easy to use, although good instructions would have been nice to have with it.</li>
      <li>Since this is my first time using a derma roller and skincare is top priority to me, I did lots research beforehand to make sure I have the best quality product for the best price and decided to buy this particular roller</li>
      <li>The wheel rolls very easily with no</li>
      <li>It was very easy to use</li>
      <li>The Derma Roller is an awesome beauty tool, after using my face felt supple and soft.</li>

      <li>It handles a lot like a very comfortable woman&#x27;s razor.  </li>
      <li>I am now very comfortable using it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable to handle and for the hand to hold and use.  </li>
      <li>When I opened the package the first thing I noticed was it comes in a very nice plastic storage case.</li>
      <li>There are many things to know and it is very important to keep things sterile.</li>
      <li>I got this roller 24 hours ago very good so far</li>
      <li>Make sure you disinfect the roller before and after each use and then apply a vitamin C serum or hylaronic acid serum after using- then moisturizers.</li>
      <li>Looking for something better.</li>
      <li>I truly love it.</li>

      <li>I love my dermawheel, and will continue to buy and use it.</li>
      <li>I am glad I did and would recommend this products to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;This seems like a good dermaroller, but it is the first one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>The way this product was securely packaged and tamper proof made me even more confident in trying this product.</li>
      <li>so you have to be very light with your hand until you find a comfortable pressure for your skin.</li>
      <li>I was really kind of scared to use this at first!</li>
      <li>It is a good place to start and get comfortable with the process before using the higher gauge needling</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not painful and no bleeding experience at all!</li>
      <li>I like the plastic case it comes in to keep the roller clean and safe</li>
      <li>have some acne scarring, discoloration and fine to medium lines.</li>
      <li>instructions printed on the box are not the best, especially for a first time user.</li>
      <li>This derma roller is absolutely everything and more!</li>
      <li>After I gave it a try, I was pleased and quickly became comfortable with it.</li>
      <li>Received my roller super quick, I&#x27;ve used it twice since and so far, so good!  </li>
      <li>the best I could describe is that it&#x27;s a little bit of a burning sensation.</li>
      <li>This has made a huge difference in the texture of my skin.  </li>
      <li>It seems that they are being absorbed better.</li>
      <li>The instructions were detailed and thorough.</li>
      <li>I use with a light hand, keep sanitized</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Seen a bit of improvement in my skin, but need to use it more to be able to really tell.</li>
      <li>but so far it working just fine, light and easily to use and very easy concept.</li>
      <li>One of the final steps to having amazing skin!</li>
      <li>When I was originally looking at this item I was concerned that it might hurt or damage my skin.  </li>
      <li>I know from doing a lot of research that this product could take up to a year to show significant improvements.</li>
      <li>I have to say I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase! It makes my skin feel so soft and alive. I need to get into a better habit of using it regularly, but so far so good!</li>
    <li> It works and I got the serum to use with it.  It does hurt a bit depending of pressure you use.  But my pores are definitely doing better.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of the dermawheels to try to help tighten up loose skin (I have lost a lot of weight and have some saggy skin to deal with).  It is still a bit early but it seems to be helping in the problem areas.  I only wish the wheel covered a larger skin area (help more with stomach, back, thighs) but the current size is perfect for fine areas like the neck and face.  For face and neck areas, the dermawheel is perfect!</li>
    <li> I truly love it. I&#x27;ve used dermawheel two times and my skin looks diferent already. It doesn&#x27;t hurt and the price is right for the product.</li>
    <li> Great product at a reasonable price! I was wary of the needles but they don&#x27;t hurt at all. I think this definitely helps with circulation similar to the concept of dry brushing the skin. Shipping is fast!</li>
    <li> Great product.  My first time to use something like this.</li>
    <li> When I was originally looking at this item I was concerned that it might hurt or damage my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt.  It&#x27;s supposed to work by slightly irritating your skin to build up collagen.  You need to use it with a lotion and I already had Vit. C and AHA lotion, that&#x27;s also supposed to help build collagen.  It will be awhile, like weeks, until I see any change, but hey, why not try?</li>
    <li> I will start by saying that I hate needles. After reading other reviews of this product, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some acne scarring, discoloration and fine to medium lines. I know from doing a lot of research that this product could take up to a year to show significant improvements. The information on the package is very minimal. Please do yourself a favor and research &amp;#34;microneedling&amp;#34; before using this product. There are many things to know and it is very important to keep things sterile. What I like about this is the fact that the needles are the smaller .5mm size. It is a good place to start and get comfortable with the process before using the higher gauge needling tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for the first time tonight and used it in conjunction with another item I just received by Foxbrim ,called &amp;#34;Peptide Complex Serum&amp;#34;. After sterilizing the tool, I used the serum on my neck and chest area, as this is slightly tougher skin and I hate needles. I then used the microneedling tool. It was very easy to use and I had very little discomfort. I felt very confident and decided to use this on my face. It did sting a little in some areas but overall it was not as unpleasant as I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use these together as recommended and hope to see good results soon.</li>
    <li> love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> When I opened the package the first thing I noticed was it comes in a very nice plastic storage case. Usually when a company cares about the packaging they care about their product. I couldn&#x27;t wait to use this when it arrived. It looks scary but it&#x27;s not. It doesn&#x27;t hurt when you roll it on your face, since I just received it I haven&#x27;t had time to see results so I will update my review once I&#x27;ve used it for a couple weeks! So far so good.</li>
    <li> Very skeptical about this product, but after hearing many great things about it, decided to order one. Thank you to the seller for a prompt shipment and great communication. I have used this product for a couple of weeks now and although quite painful in the beginning, I have gotten used to it and it has become part of my daily routine. Starting to see results. Make sure you moisturize afterwards.</li>
    <li> i do like this product but if you have sensitive facial  skin i would avoid using on your face but other wise it&#x27;s fine to use&lt;br /&gt;i received this product in return for my review</li>
    <li> Dont count on the instructions on the box. Wait the day or two for the email with the instructions so much better :) I did find that after using this for a week my skin felt tighter and looked smoother.  Its high quality in a great little case too :)</li>
    <li> Just got this roller today and gave it a try.  Feels well constructed and the needles aren&#x27;t too long.  Wasn&#x27;t painful as I used it either.  I would recommend this product to friends.</li>
    <li> The Derma Roller gets five stars from me because it has given me the results in two days that I would expect in a month.  My pores are visibly smaller with the naked eye.  There was very little redness but it went away.  I was very skeptical but now I am a believer.</li>
    <li> I have noticed an improvement on my skin. It&#x27;s beginning to even out and my hyperpigmentations are starting to disappear. I love my dermawheel, and will continue to buy and use it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first with  just the look of the derma roller. After I gave it a try, I was pleased and quickly became comfortable with it. Since the first use, I can feel the difference in my moisturizers when applies to my face and legs. It seems that they are being absorbed better. I am pleased with this purchase and look forward to even better results</li>
    <li> This derma roller is absolutely everything and more! Since this is my first time using a derma roller and skincare is top priority to me, I did lots research beforehand to make sure I have the best quality product for the best price and decided to buy this particular roller and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;Struggling with stubborn acne scars has always been an issue for me and I&#x27;ve tried various other treatments, ointments and such promising them to disappear and none of them have worked. Within the first use of this derma roller I noticed a difference in my skin and since then I have use it a total of only three times and my scars (that have been on my face for years!) are almost non existent.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen results yet but I&#x27;m going to keep trying it</li>
    <li> So far I like it, I&#x27;ve definitely seen a difference in my skin, it has been smooth on a daily basis without having to exfoliate. I just ordered the 1.0 mm derma roller because I have deep acne scars, so hopefully I will see results faster with that one.</li>
    <li> Works amazing!! I have horrible scaring under my chin due to ingrown hairs. Gross!!!! I have been able to get the scarring down significantly. I am going to try it on the scar on my arm when and iron fell on my arm. Also I thought this was going to hurt but it didn&#x27;t. And my face feels a little bit softer too. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> I loved it. I noticed some skin improvement after second use. Thank you!</li>
    <li> great product, great result. My boyfriend cannot stop commenting me on how good my skin looks (I have acne prone, oily t zone, dark spots all over because I pick on pimples- overall a gross skin). I will keep buying this every 3 months or so.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan!  This has made a huge difference in the texture of my skin.  It has also saved me lots of money now that I don&#x27;t have to pay for expensive face treatments.  I use the roller at least twice a week and I am so happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my skin</li>
    <li> I was willing to try this product, although skeptical about the needles. It&#x27;s very painful, and to repetitively do this to my face is crazy. There are many other products I&#x27;ll continue to use before I go through this torturous piercing of my skin</li>
    <li> I was unsure about this product when I was offered it at a discounted price to review, but, I must say after using it a  few times, my skin feels softer and rejuvenated.  It&#x27;s a pretty little tool.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the derma roller for a couple weeks now and I can see some improvement. Being under 30, I&#x27;m just starting to get very slight wrinkles along the smile line but the derma roller seems to be lessening them. I have very sensitive skin so I have to use it at night due to redness that occurs. The roller is not painful to use but it is certainly not comfortable either. I definitely plan to keep using it</li>
    <li> I really like this micro needle Dermaroller.  I tried an experiment for about three weeks. I have some age spots on the backs of my hands so I started using the Dermaroller every 2-3 days, but just on my left hand so I could compare the two over time.  I was pretty sceptical but now I am seeing the age spots on my left hand starting to fade, so it appears to be working!  Very good.</li>
    <li> One of the final steps to having amazing skin! Soaks in serums and moisturizers, which is great since I have dehydrated skin. Recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I was really kind of scared to use this at first! I did use it and it didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> Greay little roller. Seen a bit of improvement in my skin, but need to use it more to be able to really tell.</li>
    <li> Great product! The seller also sent me tips for its use and checked on me regularly to ensure satisfaction. Very pleased 😅</li>
    <li> Still working on this</li>
    <li> I can already tell my skin is getting softer!</li>
    <li> I got this roller 24 hours ago very good so far I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term benefits of it but so far it working just fine, light and easily to use and very easy concept. I will be doing a update soon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good things about derma roller&#x27;s lately and I&#x27;ve been really anxious to try them. So it&#x27;s been a little less than a week since I received this product and have tried it out. I have to say I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it. I did a lot of research and had a lot of help from the company help me understand exactly how to use the product. They were very nice and helpful. My face feels so much better I can actually slowly see my acne scars fading away. Which makes me so happy because that something of always been insecure about. I&#x27;m extremely satisfied</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd derma roller I have- this is a smaller needle size then my old one. I actually like it better and think I am getting better results. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re expecting it to be scary to use- but it is not. It is not painful- the best I could describe is that it&#x27;s a little bit of a burning sensation. Make sure you disinfect the roller before and after each use and then apply a vitamin C serum or hylaronic acid serum after using- then moisturizers.The results are pretty fast for wrinkles and a little longer to get rid of post-acne spots. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This was surprisingly painless. All these needles may be scary to look at, but I assure you it doesnt hurt. I used it on my stretch marks. The stretch marks seem to lighten. The results will probably improve after more uses.  My skin tone is light with a red under tone so I wasnt scared when my skin reddened a little bit. The redness went away after a while. The handle gave it nice mobility and control over the tool. The needles created a nice light pressure, it was kind of relaxing. Overall, I have had a good experience with this tool</li>
    <li> upon opening this up I got really scared lol. So I went and googled the benefits of using a derma roller. To my surprise this product increases collagen and accelerates rapid skin turnover. The only thing I would recommend to anyone before using this product is to really do your research. Go on youtube and see how to properly use this. In a nutshell the product was packaged well and I am doing more research on how to properly use this tool. It has little needles on the end</li>
    <li> I have a beauty blog called GlamRiver so I am constantly trying out all sorts of products and tools and by far the Derma Roller is the BEST tool/product I have discovered!  I think everyone needs one of these as part of the skincare routines.  The Derma Roller can help with just about every skin issue, acne, facial scars, wrinkles, hyperpigmentation and more!  If you have wanted to try one but have hesitated I am here to tell you to do it and start changing the look and feel of your skin today!&lt;br /&gt;If you are very sensitive then I recommend the .5mm one, if your not then you can go higher.  I should also mention that I am 41, however, my daughter who is 18 also uses a Derma Roller and has great success as well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as described to but really haven&#x27;t seen much benefit. If not careful it can scratch face which is not good or wanted. Looking for something better.</li>
    <li> I have only used it for a couple weeks but I like it so far.</li>
    <li> Love my Derma Roller and I will order more for my mom and my sisters.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using the product and first experience needling. I have to say I didn&#x27;t expect it to be as uncomfortable as it was and I wonder if there are some products with needles that are finer and sharper than others. It did seem that one side of the roller was more uncomfortable than the other and I wonder if some needles are bent on that side. My face is quite red afterward which I expected with others reviews. I will continue to use and see if I get positive changes in my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has really helped with my skin. I was a little worried about using it a first. Afraid it would be painful. Its not at all. I have a fear of needles so this was a bit scary to say the least. I am now very comfortable using it and it takes very little effort and time. The way this product was securely packaged and tamper proof made me even more confident in trying this product. I am glad I did and would recommend this products to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. All opinions are my own from my experience with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using my derma roller about a week now. I have noticed a difference in my face , even my coworkers asked me what a was using . I will be buying one of these for all my friends  this Christmas !</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping! Great communication! Great product at a great price! A+</li>
    <li> Excellent packaging very sturdy item did not irritate at all using on arms and legs.</li>
    <li> Sample product provided at substantial discount for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems like a good dermaroller, but it is the first one I&#x27;ve tried. I was excited to try one because I understand a lot of celebrities use them and I&#x27;ve seen the spa treatments with them, and it seems like something that would work well if done at home.  I&#x27;m in my late 40s and I&#x27;m starting to see less skin elasticity and fine wrinkles and crepy lines under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It comes in an acrylic case that is nice, and the roller itself works well.  It&#x27;s very comfortable to handle and for the hand to hold and use.  The roller works well and it has tons of tiny o.5mm needles.  It handles a lot like a very comfortable woman&#x27;s razor.  The wheel rolls very easily with no resistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  How does it feel?  It hurts!  Of course a lot of this has to do with the amount of pressure that you use, and it isn&#x27;t hard to handle, but it does hurt, and it burns after I&#x27;ve used it.  I&#x27;ve used it with hard pressure, going in different directions over the same areas - enough to make my face quite red for a couple of days like a sunburn.  That&#x27;s the way I understand the docs do it, but there&#x27;s also a lot of videos of women using it more gently.  Even mashing down VERY hard it did not make my skin bleed at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work?  My first use didn&#x27;t seem to help anything, but it&#x27;s early yet.  I&#x27;ll need more time to decide that, and I&#x27;ll update the review at a later date with results.  However, I can say that the product itself does work, seems durable, and it is easy to use, although good instructions would have been nice to have with it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  I am seeing results in just a short time! The instructions were detailed and thorough. You should really invest in this product!</li>
    <li> أنها رائعة جدا استخدمتها مرتين واظهره نتائج جيده&lt;br /&gt;  It is a truly awesome I have used it twice and see a good results</li>
    <li> Product seems to be made very well.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say that it works, but I will keep using it.  This came with a nice case, too.  Pleased overall.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I was a bit skeptical about using this product. But I was completely wrong, it works wonders! My scars on my face are fading now, and I can&#x27;t wait for them to be completely gone. First application was kind of uncomfortable but once you get used to the rolling needles on your face it was all wort it. It&#x27;s not painful and no bleeding experience at all!</li>
    <li> An interesting little product,  I have not experienced micro needling before and was worried it would be painful, however it was not so bad .... in fact I have had twice as much pain from an eyebrow waxing . After ward my skin was a little red but was easily soothed with coconut oil.  The product itself looks to be sturdy, comes in a clear reusable plastic case, witch is wrapped in a sterile package and all enclosed in a box. Instructions are on the box and could be written in bigger print but are easy to understand.  Would have liked more information like what kind of cream or serum to use and how often one should do a needling treatment safely.... etc......</li>
    <li> Great quality!  Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> This turned out to be a great length for doing between the eyebrows (11&#x27;s) and on the forehead where the skin seems thinner anyway and the bone makes that area particularly painful. I usually use a Derma Roller with a longer needle length but now will use two different lengths for treatments. It comes housed in a typical clear hard plastic storage case and has a really nice and substantial black handle. It&#x27;s also worth it to spend extra on Derma Rollers with over 500 needles like this one, my first micro-needler had only 192 needles and it was not only flimsily made but incredibly painful and quickly became dull. Once that happens it can cause harm to the skin and needs to be tossed. Hopefully these will stay sharper and last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions printed on the box are not the best, especially for a first time user. Also yo get the most out of treatments a really good 20% Vitamin C serum is a must.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used derma roller before and was absolutely amazed by the result which I had after only 5 days of using it.I&#x27;ve never believed that my skin can change in such a wondeful way without amy expensive beauty products.My main concern is rozacea and acne so I used thousand of beauty creams, lotions etc and I didn&#x27;t see such result even after months of applying them. Derma roller is my fa favourite  procuct now because it gave me confident that I can look beautiful without applying tons of makeup.My skin is getting better every day. Thank you so much for this product, will definitely recomment it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I use this product along with vitamin C serum. I was very scared to use this to start with but after couple of recommendations decided to give it a try. This one has a .5 mm needles that you roll on your skin. As scary as it sounds, it is not bad. You will feel a slight prickle on your skin. You can put a good serum either before or after using the dermaroller. I use it after. I have a vitamin C serum that stings a bit immediately after I put it on my skin. Skin does get red, so if u plan to step outside, do not use derma roller. I prefer doing it a night time. This product needs to be used for a long time to see results and I plan to update the review in couple of weeks. I am also using it on the stretch marks to see if I see any results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing I like about this product is that comes in a nice case. Seller did think about storage when they made this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I am an avid online shopper and do rely on online reviews for my online shopping decisions. I do not believe in giving dishonest or biased reviews.</li>
    <li> Very interesting product. It actually doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. The thought of needles on my face was a little awkward, but it feels pretty good.</li>
    <li> I expected that this would be painful but it&#x27;s not. I like how it makes my skin feel. Of course it&#x27;s too early to say it works the way it is advertised but I am hopeful...Will get back in touch later with more results...</li>
    <li> I love this product! Remarkable results Ina very short period of time! With every penny.</li>
    <li> Love it.. easy to use daily</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this roller for my wrinkles and let me tell you, it has made a difference already. You do feel a bit of pressure since they are little needles but it&#x27;s not to bad. Over time you get used to it and it doesn&#x27;t bother me so much. I plan to continue to use it and see great results for my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a few weeks, 2 times a week as directed. I&#x27;m not sure if I notice a difference. If there is one it seems minimal. Possibly the longer you use the product the more results you will see. This is the first product of it&#x27;s kind that I have used so I have no comparison to other products. It is very pokey so you have to be very light with your hand until you find a comfortable pressure for your skin. Some places are more sensitive than others so go slow. It is not difficult to use and fits well in your hand. I like the plastic case it comes in to keep the roller clean and safe as well as it&#x27;s compact size for storage. I will continue to use this product to see if benefits for longer use are apparent.</li>
    <li> This little device has prevented me from breaking out, has given me a  clearer complexion, my freckles and sun spots are going away and my pores are shrinking. I&#x27;m so happy with my dermaroller. I was skeptical when I&#x27;ve seen videos on dermarolling.  but after I did research and  looked at before and after pictures and read testimonials, I decided to give it a shot myself. All I can say is, I&#x27;m so happy I did. :)</li>
    <li> Received my roller super quick, I&#x27;ve used it twice since and so far, so good!  I was nervous about how much pain would be involved and it is so minimal it&#x27;s ridiculous.  Super happy and have already recommended it to many friends.</li>
    <li> I use this product along with the Vitamin C serum - I&#x27;ve only used it twice but feel like my skin is tighter - It doesn&#x27;t seem as saggy if that makes sense.  I look forward to long-term usage results.</li>
    <li> The instructions on the box do not completely explain how to use it, would have liked some better instructions along with a what else you will need section.  A little painful to use, hope to see great results soon!</li>
    <li> The Derma Roller is an awesome beauty tool, after using my face felt supple and soft. This is now a part of my beauty routine. I use with a light hand, keep sanitized and it works with no problems.</li>
    <li> I love this product ! It works so well</li>
    <li> THIS WORKS GREAT!! A LITTLE WEIRD AT FIRST BUT I LIKE IT A LOT NOW!</li>
    <li> I really liked the roller! It&#x27;s better than I had before!</li>
