<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> everything there, everything i need, great product</li>
    <li> Came with everything I needed to go from blonde to ultraviolet.</li>
    <li> Makes dying hair a more organized process!</li>
    <li> Perfect for hair coloring...it comes w all u need! Grt buy</li>
    <li> This kit comes with everything you need plus a bag for easy storage. Great price and easy to use products and not flimsy.</li>
    <li> I loved this kit.  It has all the tools I need to make coloring my hair easy.  It was worth buying it.</li>
    <li> I just love, love, love this set! Great value for the money, nice quality. I use it every month for self-highlighting - it is perfect</li>
    <li> This is a Very useful kit to have if you color your hair a lot. Very handy and very easy to clean after you use it. Worth to have it.</li>
    <li> Tint bowl leaked on first use, ruining a complete batch of color. Too much hassle to return/replace. Save yourself money and time- don&#x27;t order in the first place.</li>
    <li> This is the next best thing to having a friend help you color your hair.       I use way less hair dye by using these brushes than I did using the pointy squirt bottle.  Price is very reasonable.   You&#x27;ll use everything in the kit.    Makes a messy job much neater.   I&#x27;m able to reach more of the back of my head.</li>
    <li> Sincerely, I am delighted with the functionality of this kit which I purchased to better apply my BKT.  I find that the bowl serves a double function - 1) to pour hair treatments into - 2) a container that could be used to rinse out products from hair.  The plasticity of the bowl is well molded and quite sturdy.  The rest of the items are a plus.  I definitely recommend this kit.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time as I dye my own hair... a lot.</li>
    <li> Awesome kit!!i decided to dye my hair with drug store product, first time! Wanted to be prepared, bought this kit, can&#x27;t be more happy!</li>
    <li> This set had everything I needed and the price was just right. Not sure how exactly I could use the large comb but it was still nice to have. I wish the hair clips were a little bit stronger but they still did the job none the less. The bowl was a great size and the brushes were well made.</li>
    <li> So ever since I found all the reasons we shouldn&#x27;t dye our hair without a professional, I decided to take a more careful approach to my root touch ups.  I either buy a natural dye or a box dye.  I mix it in the bowl in this kit and apply only to my roots so as not to dry out the ends of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit comes with a wide toothed comb, gloves (which are kind of a one hit wonder), three clips for sectioning hair, a mixing bowl, and several brushes for direct application.  It works just fine.  It makes the task of saving my hair easy.  Everything washes up really easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gloves are really only good for one use.  But gloves are cheap if you buy them in a lot of 20 or so, and most other dyes come with gloves.  Everything fits in the little plastic bag for storage.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I needed! I love this kit and I used most of the pieces (Except the color bowl and brushes) on a regular basis. I am super in love with the wide toothed comb, it is exactly what I needed and my wet or dry hair is super easy to comb through with it.</li>
    <li> The bowl on this product is good, but the brushes are too stiff. Since the brushes are too stiff, most of the product squishes through to the other side of the brush while trying to apply the color. The clips are not the greatest either. This product was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> This was on my daughter&#x27;s wish list for Christmas, I bought it and had no problems with this order. I hear no complaints from her.</li>
    <li> My mom is very happy to have these.</li>
    <li> Great just great. All the tools you need.</li>
    <li> Just received this and found that some of the dipped ends of the wide-toothed comb are chipped.  Not good, as this could damage hair. The other pieces look ok. Yes, cheaply made, but should be usable for in-home coloring.</li>
    <li> Great to have the correct tools to wash the grey away, the whole process is messy enough might as well try to look like I know what I&#x27;m doing. ;)  Great price too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this set. I was really looking forward to using them but they disintegrate live up to the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are REALLY stiff. They didn&#x27;t bend at all when I tried to apply the solution. If I were only reviewing the brushes I would have given them only 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is a good size and shape. I am happy with the bowl and it is the only reason I gave this product three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchae this product again.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised. All the parts are needed in the entire process of coloring the hair. It is good enough for home use and will last for awhile.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m bleaching my hair next month and I wanted to make sure I had the right tools to do my hair and get salon-like results. The thing is, I didn&#x27;t expect was that everything was bigger than I thought it would be! When it came in the mail, I was baffled at how big everything was, LOL! Love how it has everything a colorist would need. However, the one change I&#x27;d make is that I&#x27;d add one more clip to make it four clips, since we&#x27;re usually supposed to part hair in four sections first. But overall, I can&#x27;t wait to use this kit! It shipped very quickly and the package arrived in perfect condition, and it&#x27;s definitely of salon-quality. All for a very good price :D</li>
    <li> My order did arrive a day late. But that&#x27;s okay, I don&#x27;t blame the seller, I blame USPS.   This was a good purchase. Everything displayed in the picture came in the kit. The bowl is a very good size, as a few others have said. The clips are strong enough, even for my thick hair. Though, they are much bigger than I thought they were, but that&#x27;s okay.   My only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; with this product is it is made a little cheap. Especially the wide tooth comb. It&#x27;s a little rubbery, so the bristles were slightly bent when I received the package. And the white ends on the bristles are flaking off. But that hasn&#x27;t stopped me from using it. Works great on my hair. The dye brush bristles are also a little bent because of the way they were packed in the case. But other than that, everything&#x27;s good.   Bottom line, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The large comb and the clips were quite a bit bigger than the picture made them seem, and the clips are not very good, but the brushes are great and the large comb was actually a plus!  I like the bag to store the stuff for future use as well... Coloring brushes seem to disappear on me!</li>
    <li> I recently started to color my hair at home; only because every time I&#x27;d salon-color my hair - it leaves my skin very dry. I decided to try to use less harsh products at home and wanted to make sure I have some proper tools to color my hair and achieve semi- salon looking effect. This tool is all you&#x27;ll need to get the job done. I went to my salon for a trim and my hairdresser complimented me on my hair - he asked me where did I get my hair done - because he liked the color and the result.</li>
    <li> This kit has everything you would need to color your hair.  This is going to last me forever and the price was great.</li>
    <li> I normally dyed my whole head whenever I did my hair, but I wanted to just do a streak so I needed a simple hair coloring kit. I love this product. Bowl, brushes, and three clips allow me to perfectly dye just the part of my hair that I want. Excellent for the price plus free shipping with Amazon Prime, just remember to pick up some gloves!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Excellent product. I bought the Soft N Style Hair Colorist Tool Kit for hair coloring. If I could make one improvement on the kit, I would include one more clip for a total of four, since typically we have to section hair into four sections first. Other than that I LOVE this tool kit and gave the seller a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> This item was perfect for me. I use a lot of the Splat haircolors on myself, my daughter etc. This is just what I needed for careful applications that can&#x27;t touch the scalp or face! (applying with the brushes uses a lot less haircolor too!)</li>
    <li> Good kit. Good price and quality nice. Brushes are strong quality, dries well.</li>
    <li> Hair clips are thin and cheap. One of the brushes arrived all twisted to one side so I can´t even use it. The other items are ok and useful. I like the plastic bag it comes with. Overall feels kind of cheap but it does the job, so its OK. I loved the big comb- so, mixed feelings.</li>
    <li> If you have thick hair like I do, the hair clips that come in this kit will be pretty much useless.  The clips are so flimsy that it cannot hold up my hair.  Other than that, this kit is ok for the money.</li>
    <li> Most stuff did it&#x27;s job just as it&#x27;s supposed to, my only problem was the hair clips had hardly any grip and were useless in my thick hair.</li>
    <li> This set was the most complete I could find for doing your hair, whether you&#x27;re planning on a relaxer or coloring your hair, and it&#x27;s a great set for the price. The clips that come with the set are a little flimsy and won&#x27;t hold a lot of hair, so I wouldn&#x27;t depend on them solely, especially if you&#x27;re parting your hair in big sections like one would do for a relaxer. Overall, this was worth the price for me.</li>
    <li> So it came down between this and The Invisibles 8 pcs Cosmetology Hair Coloring Tint &amp; Brush Kit. I opted for this coz i like that its black, mainly used for coloring, it wont stain the tools. The clips are fine, far from best but good enough. The wide tooth comb is sturdy, the applicators and the bowl as well. What knocked out a star for me is because the fine tooth comb, one of the tooth is bent and there were loose bristles on one of the applicators. All the same, i am keeping it. Having used it already, it works well for me.</li>
    <li> I am not a professional hair stylist, so it fits my personal needs. It wasn&#x27;t expensive, so I got my money&#x27;s worth. If I needed it for professional use, it would be considered a little on the cheaper side.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty cheaply made. I mainly bought it for the bowl and hair coloring tools, but will invest in something else soon. The hair clips are a joke.</li>
    <li> I purchased this tool kit on 10-09-2013 for $7.49. I researched several kits on amazon before deciding on this one. The 3 big clips included are a versatile tool - uses include: coloring, straightening, and curling. The coloring brushes are nothing special, but get the job done.The large tooth comb is helpful for spreading color down the hair and for gentle detangling for wet hair after showering.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the price</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good set.  The brushes and bowl seem sturdy enough.  The clips are not very useful - they are bulky and thick and don&#x27;t slide through hair very well.  For the price, it&#x27;s a good deal.  I bought two sets to have multiple on hand.  Bonus: the bags can be reused as toiletry bags quite nicely.  You might even be able to sneak through airport security with one instead of a quart bag, but don&#x27;t quote me on that.</li>
    <li> This product works for what it is needed for and I haven&#x27;t had anything break yet, so I am pleased with the brushes and bowl. Two things though:  - I do not see a point in the brush, as it&#x27;s large, clunky, and not something you can easily use when dying your hair. but outside of the kit its fine for use, combs hair. I just wouldn&#x27;t use it for dying the hair.  - the hair clips should not even be in this product. They are flimsy, useless, and it seems like the creator only put them in there to make it seem like more stuff for the price. they don&#x27;t hold hair at all, even when I tried using a *very* small chunk they would just fall out or drop the hair. they&#x27;re completely useless which was a disappointment, Even being cheap I expected them to be able to at least do something.</li>
    <li> This kit worked perfectly! I would heartily approve of anyone who is dying at home to get this essential kit.</li>
    <li> This kit solves all the problems that a novice home colorist might encounter.  The bowl is sturdy and I use it to mix 3/4 of one color with 1/4 of another color to achieve the color that I like.  The long tooth comb is excellent for long hair... for drawing all of the color through the whole head of hair when finished applying in sections...  easy on the hair and any tangles.  I much prefer using the brushes for applying color rather than using the tip of a bottle... particularly with the strands/roots closest to the face, ears and back of head.  All in all, I find this kit to be great!  The provider shipped very quickly and the package arrived in perfect condition.  I highly recommend both the kit and the seller.  5 stars all around.</li>
    <li> This set was delivered as expected and it is a great kit for my at home hair coloring.  I love that it comes with a bag to keep everything together.</li>
    <li> Such a great thing! Includes so much for so cheap and was here before expected so I was very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and have used everything in the kit and they all worked great.</li>
    <li> This shipped and two days, and was perfect, exactly what I needed. The clips held my hair tight, though they are a little large. The brushes work fantastically, and it&#x27;s very easy clean up. Great product!</li>
    <li> Thanks for super fast shipping. Item was exactly as description and bigger,this item is a steal for the price, I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase considering the price tag. Some of the clips are a little flimsy, but the brushes and color dye bowl work just fine. Not high quality, but for the $$$ it was worth it, and it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I do my own hair and thought this would be helpful. I especially wanted the hair clips but they&#x27;re too large and bulky. I have short thin hair and didn&#x27;t think it would make a difference but the clips don&#x27;t hold any of it. It also comes with a very large comb that doesn&#x27;t seem useful even if I had long hair. The only useful pieces were the three thin brushes.</li>
    <li> Great kit. Cannot not beat the price since it has prime shipping. Only improvement would be a nicer bag but still not required.</li>
    <li> Useful and inexpensive tool kit. Must have such kit if you want to play with your hair at home, ha :D</li>
    <li> This is a nice little kit! I bought this as I have begun to do my keratin treatments at home. It has everything I need and am happy to have the variety of things a salon operator has available to make things easier.</li>
    <li> got these for my wife and she absolutely loves them as these are so useful !!</li>
    <li> The shipping was super fast. Usually when I buy things that come in a kit I am worried they will be really flimsy and it will fall apart.. I&#x27;m very happy I took the chance and purchased this color/dye kit. All items are very durable and probably will last for a long time. I love that they include a wide tooth comb... Very impressed with this kit. Good deal.</li>
    <li> Arrived with the bowl broken, everything else is fine though.</li>
    <li> Very good set with high quality tools, but the large clips had ridges to hold hair that worked a little too well. Trying to remove them was difficult.</li>
    <li> Got this so I could take a stab at coloring my hair at home. Very good quality. The clips are pretty flimsy but everything else is made with durable plastic.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased hair dye brushy thingys and they haven&#x27;t come all bent and missing bristles. Good kit and hella fantastic price. Did the job well.</li>
    <li> This looks like a great product....the quality exceeded expectations...however, I haven&#x27;t yet used it.  I do anticipate it will work as well as it looks.  Some people have commented about the huge comb...it is very large, but, if your hair is long, thick and coarse you&#x27;re gonna love it!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the brushes at all and I wish the cup was larger but I do like the clips. They hold my hair pretty well.</li>
    <li> This hair dye tool kit is very handy to have around, especially if you use crazy colors like Manic Panic or Raw dyes. The brushes are useful for applying the dye to hair without too much dripping and the plastic cup is great for holding/mixing the dye before applying. The cup also has a rubbery ring around the bottom to make sure it doesn&#x27;t slide around when you&#x27;re using both hands to apply the dye. The comb is useful as well but I didn&#x27;t really use it enough to write much about it. The clips however, are very useful if you need to clip some hair up out of the way or keep a plastic bag over your hair an extended amount of time. Clean up is easy since it&#x27;s all made of black plastic, just rinse with hot water and towel dry before storing everything in the nifty clear storage zipper pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this to anyone who dyes their hair at home a lot, it really is very useful.</li>
    <li> I like the kit. I use it at home to dye my hair. It is a good quality for a good price. I really like the jumbo rake comb that helps very well to spread the color on the whole length of the hair.</li>
    <li> This kit is complete and neat.  It has everything you need to color your own hair.  Really worth it, I think.</li>
    <li> I just received this tool kit this week. Opened it today and noticed 1/2 of the plastic bowl trimming was broken off. There were no black plastic pieces in the clear plastic bag it came in; so whoever packed it knew the productive was defective before it was shipped. Too bad. I wanted to like this tool kit. But I can&#x27;t abide shady practices. I would return it, but I don&#x27;t know if the shipping is worth the expense and trouble.</li>
    <li> This really helped me to color my own hair!  I just wish the clips worked a little bit better.</li>
    <li> I just love the colorist tool kit i ordered.  It is easier to color my hair with less or little mess.  the price was right.  And it is easy to clean.  thank you.</li>
    <li> Worth investing in if coloring your own hair. Used it yesterday and it was great handling while coloring my hair. Worth the money and easy to wash.</li>
    <li> I like this product espacially the Comb, Brush, Bowl and Clips. Using this you can easily apply color at home whenever you want. If you are thinking to buy any hair colouring tool, this is the best to buy.</li>
    <li> You get a lot of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; here but it&#x27;s cheap and an app brush has already cracked on me after one application. Pay mor to ensure a long-term quality kit.</li>
    <li> This product is inexpensive and works well for me.</li>
    <li> Nice kit and well worth the money spent. All brush heads are same stiffness, so it could use a softer one also.</li>
    <li> Best set ever for doing home touch-ups!</li>
    <li> This was a great deal it has everything you need in one package for dying your hair! Just rinse everything off with soap and water when you are done and it can be reused. You cannot beat this price!</li>
    <li> AMAzing, great quality and everything came as it was told, my bowl was cracked which was upsetting but ive used it twice now and it doesnt effect it at all! great product!</li>
    <li> The clips are not too great but wonderful thing to have if you do any coloring of any type. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> excellent value for the money compared to other kits of it&#x27;s kind.  Perfect for coloring hair at home and saving money</li>
    <li> This is a great set with several different brushes, plus the clips to help divide your hair and hold it into place. The price was great and the shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> The quality of this set is just ok. The white paint on the tip of the large comb started coming off after the first use. The brushes and clips are ok and work fine. I like the little bag that it all came in. Overall, an ok product for the price.</li>
    <li> Brushes fell apart on first use.</li>
    <li> it arrived fast (about 2 or 3 days) the clips arent very strong bu ti bought it mostly for the brushes. not much too it, it was cheap, arrived fast, and works great.</li>
    <li> The product is very useful during hair dye and hair treatments. It comes with a complete set already and that&#x27;s what I love about it.</li>
    <li> Everything pictured came, shipped fast, nothing was broken, everything works fine.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m never spending money at a salon again. I was spending $75 a month to keep up my platinumish blonde hair. It makes me sick thinking about it now, because it is so easy to do your own hair. This is the perfect starter kit. It is high quality for the price and durable. I use these every month and they haven&#x27;t failed me yet. It is nice that is comes with a pouch to keep it all organized. I throw my hair color in there too.</li>
    <li> Great price and I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Shipped promptly. Great hair kit</li>
    <li> The products in this set are pretty cheap, but they look like they&#x27;re going to make my life a bit easier. I color my hair at home and I decided I wanted a big change. This weekend I&#x27;m going to bleach out my hair and dye it purple. I don&#x27;t even see how I could possibly accomplish this task without this set. It was inexpensive and everything is here. I&#x27;m a bit less nervous now.</li>
    <li> When you only spend a few bucks, you have to expect you&#x27;re only going to get a few bucks worth out of it. In this case, that was plenty.  I got this because my daughter wanted to dye her hair a rainbow and I thought it might be easier to have a few tools rather than our usual routine of slap it on and hope for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there are certainly better quality products out there, this kit gave us everything we needed and helped tremendously so I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> Love this kit it has everything you need except gloves but that&#x27;s no biggie !</li>
    <li> I bought this package mainly for the comb. But the rubber finish quickly eroded.</li>
    <li> works great if you color your hair at home.</li>
    <li> This tool kit should be on every girl&#x27;s (or guy&#x27;s) list if you do your hair coloring at home.  More control, less drip!  It takes some of the dread out of the home coloring process.  I use all the items in the kit except for the large comb.  With my hair, I don&#x27;t need it.  But the comb is a great shower comb, so it has its place.  The clips do not have much tension, but are adequate.  I have fine hair so it doesn&#x27;t hold in clips well.</li>
    <li> Good selection of products for the home hair dresser.  I am happy to have a nice selection that I could order together.</li>
    <li> Has everything I need</li>
    <li> Tremendous value that make hair coloring so much easier.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product, help a lot if you are like me and do your hair by your own. recommend it .</li>
    <li> I use it very good product, easy to wash, easy to clean, easy to use. order this product, it worth the money.</li>
    <li> I was please to find everything I need to color my hair and the big comb is super cool.  The plastic container keeps all the tools for your next color in one place. :)</li>
    <li> Great little set, have only used once so far. Clips are large enough to hold up my long hair. Due to the timing of my color the brushes are great for getting the product in the right place and for parting the hair as you go. The big toothed comb works great when my hair is tangled. Arrived quickly and was well packed in the carrying case.</li>
    <li> Great starter kit for at-home hair coloring. I used it to apply a relaxer to my curly hair and everything worked perfectly. Great price, too. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Cheap quality received this product damaged</li>
    <li> This is a great little value set. Handy to keep in bathroom for those home dye jobs.  I use it with Henna powder.  Three types of brushes are convenient.</li>
    <li> Great do it yourself kit</li>
    <li> Bought this tool kit and used once.  The brushes and the bowl are pretty good and nothing has fallen off from the brush yet...</li>
    <li> Not quite as nice as what my stylist has but worked just fine for the price (bowls and brushes).  Clips, not so great, flimsy and cheap</li>
    <li> This kit works great for at-home coloring.  The brushes allow targeted, even root coverage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting recently by dyeing my hair by myself. The last time I went to have it professionally done, it cost me about $100 to $120. I&#x27;d rather do it myself, so I decided to buy this kit to help me out a little more. Everything in the kit is actually very useful and I was able to easily section off, clip, and apply dye to my hair than I had previously been able to do. I just used my hands and fingers in the past to apply the dye, but this kit makes it so much better and a lot less frustrating. And it was so cheap! So I recommend this kit to anyone who does their own hair at home.</li>
    <li> Love the tote first..Awesome and handy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lot Of Variety in the brushes and clips and a wonderful mixing cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome and the brushes are strong. Necessary for Stylish coloring.</li>
    <li> This set was inexpensive and exactly what I was looking for, so I&#x27;m pleased with it. You might be able to find the stuff cheaper at a beauty supply shop, but the plastic case it comes in is thick with a quality zipper on it for storage and it was delivered to my door quickly.</li>
    <li> Most of the parts in this set are pretty cheap in nature, but is still gets the job done. I purchased this for my wife, as she likes to dye chunks of her hair. It is a good value for what i paid, but don’t expect top of the line or anything. She hasn’t actually used it yet, but one concern my wife had was that because the bowl is black, it might make it more difficult to get the right color. If I had to purchase one again, I might be inclined to buy a clear or opaque one.</li>
    <li> Love this set . im so glad i got it !!!!</li>
    <li> Nice kit, has everything you need to color your hair plus a little extra room for your own items. Good kit, good price!</li>
    <li> My wife bought this kit to help apply the Matrix COLORINSIDER Oil Cream hair color product. This kit includes brushes and clips which made applying the hair color product a lot easier and with more uniform coverage. The mixing bowl and brushes are especially useful. After watching a couple of videos on YouTube and the Matrix site, I colored her hair yesterday. So far, great results!</li>
    <li> It is worth the price. I found it very convenient and useful. All the accessories make it a very useful product</li>
    <li> Perfect for use with paint on color like, pravana.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive but gets the job done, thanks!</li>
    <li> This toolkit includes everything I need for hair coloring at home. The big comb was very useful for me because I have thick wavy hair which is hard to comb with a fine-tooth brush when it&#x27;s wet and tangled. The small brush was also helpful to color the small areas such as temples. And finally, I&#x27;m happy to have these hair clips. The only minus is that the big comb&#x27;s teeth were a little twisted, probably they rumpled while delivery. I think they should be more firm because they are pretty long and easy to break or rumple.</li>
    <li> My came with only one brush and didn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;3 in 1 dying tool&amp;#34;. I tried to slide one of the clips onto my hair but the little teeth are small enough to snag (and potential break) hair but not big enough to help grip anything.</li>
    <li> The product come on time, and the package was well done. For a natural this tool kit can come  in handy by me coloring my hair myself. It&#x27;s has everything that you will need if you a natural or a relax, what you see in the picture is what you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this \\&quot; yes \\&quot;</li>
    <li> Love it. Recommend it for the &amp;#34;color at home&amp;#34; gals.</li>
    <li> The bristles on the brushes were bent when I received it and they don&#x27;t straighten out.  I didn&#x27;t expect much as it was very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Excellent for at home dyeing. It was easy to apply Manic Panic with the brushes.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. I guess you get what you pay for. and I accidently ordered two. Not worth it to ship back.</li>
    <li> this has everything you need and great quality too.  I bought the shampoo cape as well and I&#x27;m all set.  I recently got streaks, and so i can no longer just colour my hair, i have to colour just the roots so this is perfect!</li>
    <li> Perfect price for what I needed it to be.</li>
    <li> Really useful kit! Got this to do manic panic coloring at home and has been so helpful. The sectioning clips are what I use the most from the kit. Easy to wash and reuse, and the storage bag keeps all the supplies together.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and was exactly what I was looking for. Good price.</li>
    <li> Great tools for coloring your own hair.</li>
    <li> This tool has all you need for hair color.  I have used a few times already and am very satisfied. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Better quality than I expected!</li>
    <li> This is great!  I&#x27;ve used it a few times already.  I love that I can keep all of the tools in the bag, including some hair colors!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet , but they look like they have good quality ! I love this cute little dying kit !</li>
