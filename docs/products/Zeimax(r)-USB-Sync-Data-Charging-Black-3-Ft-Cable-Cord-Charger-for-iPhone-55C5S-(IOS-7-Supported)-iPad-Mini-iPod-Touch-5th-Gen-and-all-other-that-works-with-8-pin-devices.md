      <li>Working well very satisfied with it, this product is doing it&#x27;s job</li>
      <li>Very pleased</li>
      <li>So I received this cable around Feb. 17-19, at first everything was absolutely perfect.</li>
      <li>It still worked kind of.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what it is stated and works great.</li>
      <li>I bought this because it was very cheap.</li>
      <li>Neither of them lasted more than an hour</li>
      <li>my partners iPhone 5s and neither phone was able to utilize the cord, do not buy.</li>
      <li>I am upset with Apple for making adapters an issue for the customer and with myself for not heeding the many warnings.</li>
      <li>So, this product worked for about 2 weeks, then my phone realized it wasn&#x27;t an authentic Apple product</li>
      <li>No warnings when plugged into iPhone 5 with latest software update (IOS 7.1).</li>
      <li>Save your money and buy from a reputable dealer.</li>
      <li>and I love the length.  </li>
      <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>After that it said it was not compatible  for the iPhone, it makes it get real hot!</li>
      <li>It is not certified and your device will recognize this very quickly.  </li>
      <li>The delivery for this item was very quick however the charger stopped working after one week of use.</li>
      <li>fine</li>
      <li>This product was fine for a week but no longer works.</li>
      <li>it was cheap</li>
      <li>I bought this because it was cheap</li>
      <li>It worked for a few days perfectly, but now when I plug it in, my phone states that the charging accessory is &amp;#34;not supported&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>This product was cheap</li>
      <li>my original charger broke and i ordered this one bc its cheap.</li>
      <li>I use it to charge my phone at night and the original one I use to charge my phone in the car.</li>
      <li>After examine the head and compared with my original one.</li>
      <li>At first I thought the price was too good to be true, but the cord is the real deal.</li>
      <li>This cheap wire if held together by super glue and does not hold.</li>
      <li>Why spend a lot for cable only too charge your phone, this one work just as good the original.</li>
      <li>Both cords broke right away!</li>
      <li>and they immediately granted me a full refund.</li>
      <li>And just to make sure I didn&#x27;t run into any problems, I put a drop of clear cement at each end of the wire sheath, right where it meets each fitting.  </li>
      <li>in all, it might be nice to have this cord as a backup at work or in the car, but it&#x27;s probably best just to buy a cord directly from Apple even though it&#x27;s more expensive.</li>
      <li>Worked fine at first and now won&#x27;t charge at all.</li>
      <li>It worked perfectly fine at first</li>
      <li>Kind of a waste of money maybe a refund would be nice, thank you.</li>
      <li>I guess there&#x27;s a short on the cord because most of the time or DOES NOT WORK!</li>
      <li>This cable thus far works well with the 5s and looking and purchasing a couple more.</li>
      <li>so far I have purchased 5 or 6 and most of them don&#x27;t work or stop working a some use.  </li>
      <li>but when I went back to using my own</li>
      <li>If I didn&#x27;t have the phone charging at a right angle my phone would not get any charge.</li>
      <li>I purchased this even after reading all of the negative comments in the hopes that I would be one of the lucky ones that would be happy with the purchase.</li>
      <li>Wishing I would have bought a few more &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>threw it out the first day.  </li>
      <li>The wire guard isn&#x27;t the most durable, but if you take care it will last a while.</li>
      <li>The first day I got it the wires were sticking out of the USB.</li>
      <li>Broke within the first 4 weeks.</li>
      <li>Exactly what you expect.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t even work in the first place.</li>
      <li>Well I should have read the reviews first.</li>
      <li>and then it broke the first day I received it.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not even worth getting a refund, but I am highly disappoint and would not recommend this products to anymore.</li>
      <li>What I love about the cord is that it is 3ft long and again the price.</li>
      <li>I love how long the cord is, much longer than the one that came with the Iphone box.</li>
      <li>&amp; i really needed a USB to have in my car.</li>
      <li>The product didn&#x27;t work, but the seller was very agreeable</li>
      <li>I guess you really do get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>They were very apologetic and offered to send me another cord.</li>
      <li>After a week the whole thing just stopped working.</li>
      <li>I bought this last week because my original charger cord stopped working.</li>
      <li>I want my money back or a new one for free.</li>
      <li>I bought a backup expecting it to fail in a short time but hoped that they would make it until I could find a better price on a good one.</li>
      <li>The previous reviewer got a better one than mine.</li>
      <li>but you may want to test these particular items closer.</li>
      <li>Broke after one week of normal use.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t work after two uses with normal use.</li>
      <li>Regardless of the other reviews, this product works perfectly fine with my iphone.</li>
      <li>Feels the same, looks the same, and works as good as the other.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even bother trying to get a new one</li>
      <li>I would not recommend, it may be cheap but not worth it.</li>
      <li>It only worked the first day .</li>
      <li>I bought this charger no less than a week ago and it&#x27;s already not working!</li>
      <li>It was a cheap purchase and a cheap, useless product.</li>
      <li>I really want my money back, even if it is $4.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your time.</li>
      <li>Youre going to have to go out and spend real money on a charger because this isnt going to last you.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money ordering this cable.  </li>
      <li>Do not waste your time or money purchasing this product.</li>
      <li>Please do not waste your time or money and order this charger cable.</li>
      <li>Not worth saving a couple bucks, rather buy one full price that will work</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t even last a week and now it only charges if in a certain position.shouldn&#x27;t even be allowed to sell</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The item worked for one plug attempt and then failed. My iphone says that the charger is not iphone certified to be used. So, a waste.</li>
    <li> Read the reviews and decided to get one anyway.  And just to make sure I didn&#x27;t run into any problems, I put a drop of clear cement at each end of the wire sheath, right where it meets each fitting.  That worked great - no problems.... and, for me, these will do just fine.&lt;br /&gt;Sure beats dealing with those over-priced Verizon Wireless banditos.</li>
    <li> Why spend a lot for cable only too charge your phone, this one work just as good the original. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> horrible doesn&#x27;t charge dont waste your money its horrible dont buy for ipod 5 just dong i regret buying it</li>
    <li> Peace of s*** don&#x27;t work for iPhone 5c at all it kept giving error message while I was pluged in.</li>
    <li> Working well very satisfied with it, this product is doing it&#x27;s job and i will buy from them again and again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even last a week and now it only charges if in a certain position.shouldn&#x27;t even be allowed to sell</li>
    <li> It literally only lasted 1 day. It should&#x27;ve at Least lasted 1 month but I got, plugged it in, and then all of a sudden smoke came out. This product was horrendous.</li>
    <li> The cord wouldn&#x27;t connect to my phone to charge it and then it broke the first day I received it.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews so I knew that they are poorly made so I bought a backup expecting it to fail in a short time but hoped that they would make it until I could find a better price on a good one. Neither of them lasted more than an hour so I would definitely stay away from this one</li>
    <li> I bought this charger no less than a week ago and it&#x27;s already not working! It worked perfectly fine at first now here it is a week later and I have to bend the cord and keep my phone in one spot, in order for it to charge. I guess there&#x27;s a short on the cord because most of the time or DOES NOT WORK! This product was cheap so it&#x27;s not even worth getting a refund, but I am highly disappoint and would not recommend this products to anymore. This was awful a waste of my time and money. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> Broke within the first 4 weeks. Kind of a waste of money maybe a refund would be nice, thank you.</li>
    <li> I-phone doesn&#x27;t like this cord, will not charge my phone to re-charge so its not much good as an I-phone replacement cord</li>
    <li> Two of the cords won&#x27;t work with my iPhone 5 I bought four and the other two work fine but I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> I bought this last week because my original charger cord stopped working. I bought this because it was very cheap. It worked for a few days perfectly, but now when I plug it in, my phone states that the charging accessory is &amp;#34;not supported&amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t waste your time!</li>
    <li> Delivery was a bit slow, but cable works as promised with iPhone 5C.  I will promise to update if this changes.  (2/28/14)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  iPhone error appeared March 20, says may not be compatible with device.  I find that this cord charges the phone slower than the cord that came with the iPhone, perhaps about 25% of the speed.  (3/23/14)</li>
    <li> The charger never worked... Waste of time and money even if it&#x27;s $5. Do not purchase this! Ugh . .</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s chord wasnt working so I bought this one to replace it. Was hesitant due to price. Wondered if it would be a good product. No complaints yet. Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Great product and I would recommend it to other people. It&#x27;s exactly what it is stated and works great. Very pleased</li>
    <li> I needed an additional cord for my office, and the ones I looked at locally were very expensive. I finally found a cable that was compatible and had a cost savings. What I love about the cord is that it is 3ft long and again the price.</li>
    <li> Plugged it in and it would turn on and off. Didn&#x27;t work after one day. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after a week. From the first use, iphone would say that the accessory was not supported by apple but at least it would still charge.... After a week the whole thing just stopped working.</li>
    <li> my original charger broke and i ordered this one bc its cheap. charges very slowly and stopped working. dont waist your money</li>
    <li> After two weeks it had a shortage. The lightening bulb would say my phone is charging but it never was, the batter percentage would get lower. If I didn&#x27;t have the phone charging at a right angle my phone would not get any charge. It is a serious hazard for me not to have my cell phone charged at all times; as well as frustrating. I thought it was my phone that wasn&#x27;t working but when I tried a friends phone charger it worked perfectly but when I went back to using my own it didn&#x27;t. I want my money back or a new one for free.</li>
    <li> This item was terrible, it stopped working after about 4 or 5 days. I would not recommend, it may be cheap but not worth it.</li>
    <li> I have had to use it a few times and have not had any issues. I would recommend this charger.</li>
    <li> So I received this cable around Feb. 17-19, at first everything was absolutely perfect. Now currently my phone does not want to charge anymore, now it&#x27;s saying it not compatible.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Regardless of the other reviews, this product works perfectly fine with my iphone. I&#x27;ve had no problems with it yet.</li>
    <li> This product did not work on my phone. Was not supported . Not happy at all don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this and it worked for 2 days before the wires broke. This cheap wire if held together by super glue and does not hold. Youre going to have to go out and spend real money on a charger because this isnt going to last you.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all. I did not try it before traveling thus I have to buy one from local Apple store while traveling. Do not waste your time. Terrible product.</li>
    <li> The first day I got it the wires were sticking out of the USB. And that was when I opened it.</li>
    <li> It only worked the first day . After that it said it was not compatible  for the iPhone, it makes it get real hot! Does not charge the phone at all!</li>
    <li> Stopped working a week after purchase. Worked fine at first and now won&#x27;t charge at all. I suggest you don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> Purchased 2 wires they stopped working 2 weeks later both in my car, on my computer and on the charging plug.</li>
    <li> Well I should have read the reviews first. Thought its just a simple connector. The previous reviewer got a better one than mine. It doesn&#x27;t even work in the first place. After examine the head and compared with my original one. And I know why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS ONE</li>
    <li> This charger broke within one week of purchase. Bought it for my daughter and within about a week it no longer worked. You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> I purchased this even after reading all of the negative comments in the hopes that I would be one of the lucky ones that would be happy with the purchase. I was for a couple if weeks and then got a warning that it was not an Apple product and not compatible with my iPhone 5c. I retried it and it worked. However the next day it stopped working. I even bought one when I purchased my phone and it lasted about six months. I am upset with Apple for making adapters an issue for the customer and with myself for not heeding the many warnings. It was a cheap purchase and a cheap, useless product. I do not recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> It does not work. So sorry I bought it. I guess sometimes you get what you pay for. Do not recommend</li>
    <li> This was an aweful product!! Both cords broke right away! The cord just falls apart! It is a waste of money!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not apple certified and you can potentially get it to work every once in a while, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it reliable.</li>
    <li> Broke after one week of normal use. Connection to phone broke and I had to through it out. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> The delivery for this item was very quick however the charger stopped working after one week of use. Not worth saving a couple bucks, rather buy one full price that will work</li>
    <li> So, this product worked for about 2 weeks, then my phone realized it wasn&#x27;t an authentic Apple product and it stopped charging my phone. I wrote the seller and told them what happened. They were very apologetic and offered to send me another cord. I told them I&#x27;d rather just have my few dollars back and they immediately granted me a full refund. A few days later, a cord arrived in the mail anyways. The product didn&#x27;t work, but the seller was very agreeable and now I at least have a backup cord in case I really need one in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it might be nice to have this cord as a backup at work or in the car, but it&#x27;s probably best just to buy a cord directly from Apple even though it&#x27;s more expensive.</li>
    <li> Broke the second time I used it. I was so annoyed that I spent about $5 on such a cheap product. DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> It worked for one week!!!  I will not be buying this again or recommending it to anyone.  What a disappointment.</li>
    <li> bought this as a replacement charger for my mini ipad, used it 1 time and no longer charges.  the prices was great... but the quality was horrible.</li>
    <li> It sucks.  It wouldn&#x27;t charge my phone threw it out the first day.  I didn&#x27;t even bother trying to get a new one</li>
    <li> I just wanted a wire to keep in my car to play music. I bought it because it was inexpensive. It arrived in a prompt manner and worked just like the one my phone came with. Would buy from again.</li>
    <li> Will not work with my iPhone says not a apple certified charger! Basically wasted $20 I would put a negative star if you had one</li>
    <li> After I informed the company, it is not working. And they sent me another one but it didn&#x27;t work too.&lt;br /&gt;This product is not comparable with iphone 5s</li>
    <li> Bought this cable for my sons Iphone 5C it worked for about two weeks.  I think there may have been an update by apple not sure but the cable will not charge the phone.  Error message comes up to the tune of it does not recognize the charging cable therefore will not charge the phone.</li>
    <li> Stopped working a few days later. I really want my money back, even if it is $4. What a rip off!</li>
    <li> I purchased this cable and it charged my iphone 5S for two weeks.  After that it stop working.  Save your money and buy from a reputable dealer.</li>
    <li> I love how long the cord is, much longer than the one that came with the Iphone box. I use it to charge my phone at night and the original one I use to charge my phone in the car.</li>
    <li> I tried using this product with my iPhone 5c and my partners iPhone 5s and neither phone was able to utilize the cord, do not buy. Tried to get a refund from the seller and they never returned my emails.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. Do not buy. You will get what you pay for. Which is very little. Save your time and money</li>
    <li> I am always leery about purchasing off brand cables with for Apple products.  They always seem to have an issue.  This cable thus far works well with the 5s and looking and purchasing a couple more.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product last week and received it this Tuesday. The cord was very fragile and broke as soon as I opened the package. It still worked kind of. It just say the accessory is not for apple.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t purchase this product as Apple is blocking consumers from using after market products that are not authenticated.  A message appeared on my phone saying, &amp;#34;This cable or accessory is not certified and may not work reliably with this iPhone.&amp;#34;  Some people can get around this by unplugging the cord followed by plugging it back in, but this does not work at all on my phone.</li>
    <li> So far so good! This charger is actaully really great quality! I am  very happy with my purchase . Wishing I would have bought a few more &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I guess you really do get what you pay for. This product was fine for a week but no longer works. When I now plug it in it does not charge the phone at all. I will try to get a refund.</li>
    <li> Works great! At first I thought the price was too good to be true, but the cord is the real deal.</li>
    <li> Got it in the mail plugged it in to charge my phone, didn&#x27;t charge it at all I tried multiple USB ports and a couple different phones and my IPad it didn&#x27;t work on any thing.</li>
    <li> Does not work on iphone5s&lt;br /&gt;The software on phone knows it is not an apple cord.  It did not work</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was cheap &amp; i really needed a USB to have in my car. long story short, it doesn&#x27;t work at all, not even in the wall! it was cheap so i didn&#x27;t bother placing it into dispute! Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this product!</li>
    <li> Heavy gauge cable...  No warnings when plugged into iPhone 5 with latest software update (IOS 7.1). I wish every cable I had was this one.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works great and I love the length.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a charger for their phone</li>
    <li> This will not work for your iPhone!  Do not waste your money ordering this cable.  It is not certified and your device will recognize this very quickly.  Save your money and get an actual Apple cable.</li>
    <li> I got this cable about a week and a half ago and it&#x27;s already not working - not compatible with iPhone 5.  Not only does it not charge my phone, it makes my phone heat up.  Buy it if you want to waste your money.</li>
    <li> I wish there was a way to leave no stars. Didn&#x27;t work after two uses with normal use. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your time or money purchasing this product. It worked ONE day and that is all! I purchased it for my iPhone 5 and not happy at all.</li>
    <li> I used the cord for a week &amp; a half until it stopped working for my phone. Not happy about the quality.</li>
    <li> Please do not waste your time or money and order this charger cable. After a week it stop working.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> Horrible! It&#x27;s won&#x27;t connect with my phone because it is not a certified product? DO NOT BUY HORRBLE TERRRBLE PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I see no difference between this cable and the actual apple cable. Feels the same, looks the same, and works as good as the other. The only difference is the price and this one is cheaper!</li>
    <li> This item is terrible. I ordered it once and it didn&#x27;t work so they shipped me another one that also DOESNT WORK.</li>
    <li> Exactly what you expect. The wire guard isn&#x27;t the most durable, but if you take care it will last a while. No issues.</li>
    <li> This cord arrived in a timely manner and was inexpensive. Unfortunatly, it does not charge my phone. Everytime I plug this into my computer,  tells me something along the lines of, &amp;#34;this phone is not supported by this device&amp;#34; and my phone does not charge. Not sure why, but it doesn&#x27;t work and is frustrating.</li>
    <li> so far I have purchased 5 or 6 and most of them don&#x27;t work or stop working a some use.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with anything else I a received through Amazon but you may want to test these particular items closer.</li>
    <li> Purchased three and in on the third one already less then a month in because the other two decided to stop working</li>
