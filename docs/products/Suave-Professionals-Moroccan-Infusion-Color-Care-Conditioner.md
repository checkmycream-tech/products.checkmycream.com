      <li>All Suave products are good and this is no exception</li>
      <li>The shampoo alone is so good, I don&#x27;t need conditioner.</li>
      <li>Love This shampoo!</li>
      <li>I have to say I am pretty impressed!</li>
      <li>My favorite part: the scent!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Very pleased!</li>
      <li>But like I said, I do love the smell!</li>
      <li>It has impressed me as being high quality while still being a good value.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant exotic floral scent.  </li>
      <li>smell of the conditioner is great and it washes out quite easily.</li>
      <li>This adds moisture to your hair in an amazing way.  </li>
      <li>The smell is amazing and seems to be enhanced when you&#x27;re in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But this one is just as nice and leaves my hair just as moisturized and tangle-free.</li>
      <li>but I really liked it.</li>
      <li>It smells nice, lathers and rinses out well</li>
      <li>for the color care aspect, I honestly have yet to find a shampoo or conditioner that I feel impacts the length of color.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with it.</li>
      <li>But anyone I know who has tried mine liked it as well.</li>
      <li>It has a perfumey kind of scent</li>
      <li>Plus, the scent is pleasant but light.</li>
      <li>My hair is very soft and with an incredible shine!</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine though, so</li>
      <li>texture of the hair felt very smooth to the touch, but it was not \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is probably the best conditioner I&#x27;ve tried to date for overall look texture, weight and shine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping come summer, when the humidity picks up a bit, this will be a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Argan oil is both edible and has many uses in cosmetics, skin treatment and hair care products.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m adding this to my list of favorite Suave conditioners.</li>
      <li>You just end up using more product.</li>
      <li>I love how it makes my hair feel.</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>also have bleached highlights, which causes MORE chemical damage.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really love this color care conditioner.</li>
      <li>I used to spend a fortune on salon brand shampoos and conditioners, thinking they were much better for my hair than the \\&quot;grocery store\\&quot; brands.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy the scent as well, for some reason it reminds me of Christmas (kind of a cinnamon smell).  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve received several compliments from people coming in to hug me saying my hair smells great!</li>
      <li>I love to pamper myself.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of the coconut smell, so it was perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it lingers, a favorite scent of mine</li>
      <li>most conditioners after shampooing it recommends you leave in your hair for 3-5 minutes before rinsing out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m bummed because I really love how this conditioner and the shampoo makes my hair feel and look.</li>
      <li>Then when traveling and not being able to find my shampoo in an \\&quot;under 4 oz.\\&quot; size that I could carry on the plane I decided to wait until I reached my destination to buy some.</li>
      <li>As much as I love the Shampoo and serum that go hand-in-hand with this one, it&#x27;s just not all that</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance of this conditioner.</li>
      <li>That is something I haven&#x27;t been able to do in years since before I started coloring it every 6 weeks</li>
      <li>and I still love it.</li>
      <li>I love conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Unlike Pantene which gives up after the 3rd use, this keeps going &amp; is probably the best Suave product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I really liked the way the conditioner made my hair silky and light.</li>
      <li>and I do really love the smell.</li>
      <li>Recommend for people who want something more sophisticated than Suave kid shampoos.</li>
      <li>which works great, but got this new stuff to test through Vine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love the scent, I could imagine not everyone will though, it is a strong Moroccan oil scent...</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a flower, fruit, perfume, CLEAN, nature smell like most cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not too strong at all</li>
      <li>Smells great and my hair feels super soft after I use it!</li>
      <li>This conditioner does a fine job working with it&#x27;s partner shampoo.</li>
      <li>It has a warm, slightly exotic scent, not overwhelming, just very nice.</li>
      <li>I bought this one because I was traveling in a smoggy area and could almost feel the smog in my hair, but also because it was cheap</li>
      <li>Great quality conditioner at a low price.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as I&#x27;d like.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also seems to help my coloring looking more fresh for longer.</li>
      <li>First of all, I love the scent of this conditioner.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I read all the reviews on this product and thought I would give it a try for the price. The product for one smells just like the Moroccanoil products. I had never used any Moroccan  oil products so I was surprised by the smell but I really liked it. The bottle is large so it will last at least 2 months. I am black but I have mixed textured hair. I relaxe my hair to get rid of some of my frizz and define my curls. I had recently colored my hair so I thought this would be perfect so I also purchased the shampoo. I really liked the way the conditioner made my hair silky and light. It gave my hair a very nice shine without feeling heavy. My boyfriend is Ukrainian with straight hair and he loved this conditioner because usually when his hair drys it looks a little untamed but with the conditioner it was tamed and styled. I would recommend the conditioner with the shampoo for all hair types but especially for colored treated hair.</li>
    <li> I am in love with these new products and the soft shiny way they leave my hair. Some if the Moroccan products out there are very expensive but this one is affordable and works amazing! Not greasy just soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> First of all, I love the scent of this conditioner.  I have used tresemme and it leaves my hair dry and stiff. Suave leaves it feeling soft and very manageable.</li>
    <li> Wow,  this will out last my last conditioner by more than a bottle of shampoo.  Need only one bottle per two bottles of shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo/conditioner for several months now and have noticed some nice improvement from my dry and brittle ends. It adds shine/moisture to my dry areas without making my hair oily. My hair feels softer AND cleaner (not like I&#x27;ve put detergent on it to strip it clean). That&#x27;s all I really ask for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to rant and rave. It&#x27;s not a miracle cure. My hair still has issues. I still have to work with it, fix it, style it. But I like this Moroccan product more than any other non-salon things I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the SMELL (big subject with this one):&lt;br /&gt;Go to the stores and test the smell for yourself before you buy this!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s one of those that you either will like it or possibly HATE it. Seriously. It&#x27;s different.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a flower, fruit, perfume, CLEAN, nature smell like most cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a spice, cologne, musk sort of scent to it. It&#x27;s a heavy scent. It&#x27;s strong when you&#x27;re using it, but it doesn&#x27;t linger so much once washed out and out of the shower. Personally, I think it just throws people because it&#x27;s not the ~common~ type of artificial fragrance put in cleansers (they&#x27;re all fake-used to fool you into THINKING you&#x27;re getting cleaner, anyway) but don&#x27;t get this larger size bottle (this is twice the size of standard shampoo/conditioner bottles) before knowing the scent.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works great. It does not take much for each use. and it gets all the tangles out. Great buy and I will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> This adds moisture to your hair in an amazing way.  It feels like you must have bought it at the salon.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s hard for me to find a conditioner that feels light on my hair. I don&#x27;t shampoo my hair everyday, but this provides enough conditioning that my hair doesn&#x27;t get oily again overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend not leaving on for too long.</li>
    <li> Great quality conditioner at a low price. I use it with the Moroccan Infusion Color Care shampoo for soft and silky hair every time.</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S CONDITIONER PEOPLE-it conditions ones head hair. Its labeled &amp;#34;Color care&amp;#34; for those folks who (wait for it) COLOR THEIR HAIR! Revolutionary-I KNOW! For those persons who do NOT color their hair, it may make their head hair feel weighed down (it may also be from a lack of oxygen to their brains but who can say). It is also labeled MOROCCAN-apparently attributed to its scent.  Morocco is a place in northern Africa-think hot, dry, a desert like place with sweaty people &amp; the only thing that can cut thru all that is strong musky scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get a little real for a second: i color my hair (yep from the box) to cover those newly formed GREYS (not the aliens-the head hairs) and after 8 weeks-the color (much to my dismay) is still going strong. It isnt weighed down or greasy (I shower daily) and I do like the scent-which smells like an Indian restaurant next door to a Pier 1. Unlike Pantene which gives up after the 3rd use, this keeps going &amp; is probably the best Suave product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Leaves a nice fragrance in your hair!</li>
    <li> This conditioner did a good job providing moisture to my hair without stripping away the color. It wasn&#x27;t anything extraordinary, but it certainly did what it was intended to do. I didn&#x27;t hate it, but I didn&#x27;t love it either.</li>
    <li> I felt like it didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair and it left a film that I hate in my hair. Not my fave Suave product.</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderful! My hair is very soft and with an incredible shine! Opreço is very good! I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this product for awhile and it does a great job of conditioning the hair. It feels really good after using it. It seems to work about the same as other conditioners. I wouldn&#x27;t pay a lot for this product but it seems to be one of the moderate level conditioners that all seem to be about equal. It is not salon quality. It does have a good scent. I couldn&#x27;t really notice any extra shine from the Moroccan oil. So if you are looking for a moderate priced conditioner that works you may try this one as Suave put out a decent product as usual with this one.</li>
    <li> As much as I love the Shampoo and serum that go hand-in-hand with this one, it&#x27;s just not all that remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a very dry climate and my hair is in that stage of being color treated where it is very fly-away an staticy. This product is gentle and isn&#x27;t stripping my color but it&#x27;s not very moisturizing either. I actually have been using this and then putting the shine mask on over it just to get my hair to a point it&#x27;s not sticking out everywhere constantly. My hair is very fine though, so I like that this also isn&#x27;t so heavy it weighs my hair down. I&#x27;m hoping come summer, when the humidity picks up a bit, this will be a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just not going to deliver a lot of moisturizing if you&#x27;re in need of it. I recommend adding a mask product like [[ASIN:B00A0IWSN4 Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Deep Conditioning Shine Mask, 8 Ounce]] and the [[ASIN:B00A0IWSIO Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Moroccan Argan Styling Oil, 3 Ounce]] to your routine for a better overall result at a decent price. :)</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of the regular Suave line so I was a bit skeptical about this conditioner but decided to give it a try. I have to say I am pretty impressed! I have long thick wavy hair that has been highlighted for about 10 years now. This conditioner does an even better job at keeping my hair shiny and soft than some of the more expensive brands (I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks along with the shampoo)! The scent is a non floral scent, something that reminds me of what is used in the salon. The best part about Suave Professionals is the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is nice and thick. It is not watered down and runny. It left my hair feeling soft and well conditioned, probably because one of the main ingredients is a silicone. I have curly, colored hair and I like silicone based products so this conditioner worked well for me.  It has a perfumey kind of scent but it was not too overpowering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Conditioner for a month now and the change in my hair has been remarkable. I have corse think hair that I straighten daily. After using this shampoo for a few weeks my hair maintained shine consistently. I know longer have frizz or fly aways! I would recommend this to anyone with complex hair.</li>
    <li> When I color my hair, I want to take great care of it.  I started using the Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care conditioner to keep it looking great and to give me that shine no matter if I just dyed my hair or it has been a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Organix Moroccan Argan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner Set ($20 for 13 oz of each) and my thin, fine hair has never been softer or shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected this conditioner to work fine because the ingredients were similar to those in Organix and I was not disappointed.  As long as I rinse really well, my hair looks and feels great all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product costs only 20 percent of what I was paying for the Organix with the same results.  So I will switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum: both my daughter and I had to stop using any product with argan oil after we developed an allergy that started with a rash on our scalp and forehead and moved down our faces.  The dermatologist prescribed a very expensive ointment but I never purchased it and the rash went away for both of us shortly after we stopped using the shampoo.  I hate that because it really did make my hair look good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not convinced as far as a color conditioner, and I&#x27;ve also had better conditioners, but been using this hand in hand with the Suave color shampoo for about a month now and I do really love the smell. I usually switch between Pantene and Aussie as I&#x27;m one who believes my hair gets used to one and needs to switch (I know this has been proven as a myth but my hair disagrees!). I have highlights and thought I&#x27;d give the color care a try but so far I really don&#x27;t see any difference between this and my normal shampoos. But like I said, I do love the smell! Very vanilly and it lingers, a favorite scent of mine and I&#x27;m not one for perfumes so I dig it! Not too strong at all and I&#x27;ve received several compliments from people coming in to hug me saying my hair smells great! Recommended!</li>
    <li> I really like this conditioner, it really leaves my hair nice and soft.  It removes tangles well.  I really enjoy the scent as well, for some reason it reminds me of Christmas (kind of a cinnamon smell).  It helps to retain color.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been a Suave fan for a long time. But in the past year I started trying other products because I couldn&#x27;t find a conditioner that actually made my long hair tangle free.&lt;br /&gt;This one did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;I have been coloring my hair for 20 years, so it has chemical damage.&lt;br /&gt;I also have bleached highlights, which causes MORE chemical damage.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is beyond the midpoint of my back - rather long.&lt;br /&gt;It has a medium texture. Not super thick and not super fine.&lt;br /&gt;In the FIRST use this was my observation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair had far less \\&quot;fly aways\\&quot; from pony tails sticking out.&lt;br /&gt;The hair lays nicely around my shoulders instead of bunching up around my neck.&lt;br /&gt;There was a slight shine to it that wasn&#x27;t there with my Aussie conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the hair felt very smooth to the touch, but it was not \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I could run my fingers from root to tip in my WET hair and they came through with little resistance. That is something I haven&#x27;t been able to do in years since before I started coloring it every 6 weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;This is probably the best conditioner I&#x27;ve tried to date for overall look texture, weight and shine. Far better than several expensive salon brands I&#x27;ve used including Biolage and Matrix.  I&#x27;m thrilled with it. And the price? I would definitely be willing to pay much more for this.  And on top of it all, it smells wonderful. Sweet and spicy, but not too perfumed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Conditioner with Moroccan argan oil . This conditioner is recommended for color treated or dull/dry hair textures. If you fall into that category and your hair is also thin/straight or slightly curly I would highly recommend running out and trying this now. But Suave Moroccan Color Care Conditioner will not work well on thick hair or hair that is extremely curly or dry/brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently dyed my hair and after a few weeks noticed it was feeling extremely dry and so I was excited to try this in the hopes it would add some much needed moister/softness to my hair. It did neither, the best thing about this conditioner is the Moroccan argan oil which makes every use like an exotic aroma therapy treatment. The smell is amazing and seems to be enhanced when you&#x27;re in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most conditioners after shampooing it recommends you leave in your hair for 3-5 minutes before rinsing out. But even if you do that unless you have great hair already this conditioner wont help you.</li>
    <li> The [[ASIN:B00A0IWRU8 Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Shine Conditioner 28 oz]] is a solid product.  It conditions well (you only need a small amount), and helps protect colored hair.  It has a pleasant exotic floral scent.  The Moroccan in the name is because it is made with argan oil, which is extracted from seeds of the North African Argan tree.  Argan oil is both edible and has many uses in cosmetics, skin treatment and hair care products.  It has exploded on the market, but time will tell whether that is sustainable or not.</li>
    <li> Suave Professionals Moroccan conditioner gave my hair the same soft, silky results as the higher priced Moroccan oil product. Without styling, my hair dries soft and tangle free. Plus, the scent is pleasant but light. Definitely recommend trying this in conjunction with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Yes, Suave is a \\&quot;budget brand\\&quot;, but I have no complaints whatsoever with the Moroccan line.  They are the perfect combination of price and quality and, yes, this stuff in the products is amazing.  I&#x27;ve tried several products and can&#x27;t say enough good about them.  And I usually don&#x27;t care for Suave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the color protection goes, this does that job without slacking on the other purposes of a conditioner. Yes, your color will be protected and given a bit of shine, but this is also about as deep of a regular conditioner as you can hope for.  Wonderful smell as well.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works very well for me. I have extremely dry hair and it&#x27;s a struggle to find a balance between moisture and weight. After using this conditioner, it feels like my hair has had a deep conditioning, yet my hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down and heavy. It&#x27;s a perfect mate to the shampoo from this line. My favorite part: the scent! I absolutely adore the way this whole product line smells. It&#x27;s a woodsy, slightly oriental fragrance that I just want to take a bath in! Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Conditioner has a very strong but inoffensive odor, earthy and sweet at the same time.  It does noticeably condition the hair leaving it smooth and shiny without leaving a heavy residue and making it easier to style.</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with the Suave Moroccan line. It has impressed me as being high quality while still being a good value. This conditioner does a fine job working with it&#x27;s partner shampoo. It is detangling and moisturizing. Even in hard water it rinses cleanly and leaves no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only quibble with this conditioner is that is feels a little less concentrated than the other products in this line that I have tried. It is still a great product. You just end up using more product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little picky about conditioner. My hair is slightly oily, but is also very coarse and can be dried out easily by many shampoos... a lot of conditioners tend to gunk my hair up with residue while still leaving hair sort of frizzy after washing. I need a conditioner that will moisturize my coarse hair after a wash, but not leave it gunked up as my scalp will put out its own natural moisturizer fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B0058DIXTE Neutrogena Clean Replenishing Conditioner, 10.1 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] which works great, but got this new stuff to test through Vine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say -- it works great. After it dried (towel / air dry), my hair felt light and smooth, almost feathery... but not frizzy. This is good conditioner for my hair type. My only negative comment is that the scent is somewhat cloying. I&#x27;m a guy and don&#x27;t like that sort of heavy incense-y sorta scent hanging around in my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been really impressed with Suave&#x27;s selection of hair products lately and this Moroccan Infusion Color Care Conditioner is no exception. The conditioner works great and left my hair feeling soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the conditioner is great and it washes out quite easily. I&#x27;d recommend partnering it with the accompanying shampoo for optimum effects. The conditioner is not too heavy, but you also don&#x27;t need to use too much of it to reap the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you color your hair or are just looking for a new conditioner, I&#x27;d recommend giving this Moroccan Infusion a try. I really liked how shiny and smooth it left my hair feeling.</li>
    <li> The product is very heavy and smells kind of weird.  It really didn&#x27;t condition my hair all that well and was difficult to wash out.  I didn&#x27;t see any particular shine or improvement to my hair in terms of strength, taming frizz or feeling fuller.  Not for me.</li>
    <li> for such an inexpensive item this conditioner works really well. makes my hair soft and shiny and does not weight it down</li>
    <li> I was really surprised at how nice this conditioner works.  I do not have color treated hair, but I do have curly hair that tends to frizz.  I try to use products with some oil to help keep things under control, yet don&#x27;t strip (hence some color treated products in in my line-up) and it this a very good product for the money.  It is not as good as some of the more pricey products, but for the price, it is a very good stand in.  I would suggest that those with curly hair only do a light rinse to leave some in.</li>
    <li> Love This shampoo! Smells great and my hair feels super soft after I use it!</li>
    <li> I was thrilled with this shampoo/conditioner! I had already tried one of the other sets from this Moroccan line, and it had too strong a smell for me. Otherwise, I loved how it made my hair feel. With this one, my hair still feels wonderfully soft, but I don&#x27;t have to worry about that strong smell. This one has a somewhat coconut smell. I&#x27;m a big fan of the coconut smell, so it was perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased!</li>
    <li> The test of a good conditioner for me is if it leaves my hair smooth, without fly aways, but also without feeling heavy or weighted down.  I used the shampoo and conditioner together and I feel it succeeded.  My blonde color didn&#x27;t dull but it felt very clean and with fewer frizzies than I had been experiencing with Pantene.  In all, pleased with the product, especially the price.</li>
    <li> All Suave products are good and this is no exception Hair feels great and looks phenomenon. Recommend for people who want something more sophisticated than Suave kid shampoos.</li>
    <li> As someone who can only wash her hair 2-3 times a week (or it dries out horribly), I&#x27;m willing to spend a little on shampoo. However, thanks to the Suave Professionals, I really don&#x27;t have to. The Moroccan Infusion line has joined the Keratin line in my repertoire. It smells nice, lathers and rinses out well and (when used with the conditioner) leaves my hair very clean and soft. Worth the money!</li>
    <li> My wife who generally uses professional products loves this. She has long, dark hair and uses a straightner everyday but this makes her hair look smooth and shiny. The one thing she didn&#x27;t like was how this smells, a bit too spicy. She&#x27;s saving us some money using this over the other products she has used!</li>
    <li> For reference, I have baby fine, long, wavy hair, which has highlights and lowlights and the ends of my hair tend to get dryed out. My usual and favorite shampoo is Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smoothing Shampoo and I also use the matching conditioner Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Smoothing Conditioner. If you use and like the former, you will like this one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo and the matching conditioner Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Conditioner both have a heavenly scent, which lasts on my hair all day if I let my hair dry naturally. It&#x27;s just a fabulously Moroccan spicy scent, which lingers and it is totally relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I also love is that this shampoo and matching conditioner help my dry ends, but they don&#x27;t weigh down the rest of my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also seems to help my coloring looking more fresh for longer. I&#x27;d highly recommend it for someone with a similiar hair type or for someone who loves a richly scented shampoo.</li>
    <li> I really love this color care conditioner. It gives my color the added boost it needs to make my color last instead of fade away. This leaves my hair very shiney as well as easy to care for. I like that it works on all types of hair color as well. Great product and it smells so good and does not irratate my sinuses.</li>
    <li> I will admit I was never a fan of Suave hair care products, but Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Conditioner isn&#x27;t bad at all. Like all Suave products, it is priced less than most conditioners. Unlike most Suave products, this conditioner does a decent job. It has a moderate, pleasant scent. Unlike some conditioners, it makes my hair soft without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Conditioner is a just a good, inexpensive conditioner, and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Suave&#x27;s Professional Moroccan Infusion Conditioner feels gummy to me, and doesn&#x27;t work very well with my hair. I absolutely love the Moroccan Infusion shampoo that is my favorite shampoo by far. The conditioner doesn&#x27;t do much for me. The shampoo alone is so good, I don&#x27;t need conditioner. When I apply the conditioner, I don&#x27;t like the gummy feeling. It doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as I&#x27;d like. And it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00A0IWRRG Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Shampoo 28 oz]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m adding this to my list of favorite Suave conditioners. My old favorite that I&#x27;ve been using since it came out is [[ASIN:B001P24VEI Suave Professionals, conditioner, humectant moisture, 28oz]] and I still love it. But this one is just as nice and leaves my hair just as moisturized and tangle-free. I love the fragrance of this conditioner. It has a warm, slightly exotic scent, not overwhelming, just very nice. I&#x27;ve also used the [[ASIN:B00A0IWSN4 Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Deep Conditioning Shine Mask, 8 Ounce]] which I like very much and which complements this conditioner. I only use the shine mask once or twice a week though because it using it more often would probably leave my hair oily or flat. I have yet to try the [[ASIN:B00A0IWRRG Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Shampoo 28 oz]] but that is next on my list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to see that Suave is coming out with all these new products. I used to spend a fortune on salon brand shampoos and conditioners, thinking they were much better for my hair than the \\&quot;grocery store\\&quot; brands. Then when traveling and not being able to find my shampoo in an \\&quot;under 4 oz.\\&quot; size that I could carry on the plane I decided to wait until I reached my destination to buy some. I bought this one because I was traveling in a smoggy area and could almost feel the smog in my hair, but also because it was cheap and I wouldn&#x27;t feel bad about leaving a good portion of it behind at the end of the trip. (I gave the remaining shampoo to the person at the hotel front desk).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so surprised to find that this shampoo left my fine, flyaway hair just as clean and soft as as the more expensive brands. I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between this shampoo and my much more expensive salon brand! Still, I thought maybe it was just the difference in water or the weather at the place I was staying on the trip. I bought the shampoo again at home when I ran out of my salon brand and found that it performed just as well with the local water, weather, etc. That was 4 years ago and I have been using Suave shampoos and conditioners ever since. I haven&#x27;t found a single one that I don&#x27;t like and I&#x27;ve saved a bundle on shampoos and conditioners.well with the local water, weather, etc. That was 4 years ago and I have been using Suave shampoos and conditioners ever since. I haven&#x27;t found a single one that I don&#x27;t like and I&#x27;ve saved a bundle on shampoos and conditioners.</li>
    <li> THE BEST Conditioner for the price.  Leaves hair soft and detangled. Love the scent, I could imagine not everyone will though, it is a strong Moroccan oil scent...if you don&#x27;t like the oil, you won&#x27;t like the conditioner. But anyone I know who has tried mine liked it as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of Suave conditioners over the years and my biggest complaint has always been that it takes 2-3 times as much product to get the same result I get from other brands, so the value is lost.  This is not the case with this product!  The first time I used it, I used what I would consider a normal amount for Suave conditioner and it was WAY too much!  Now, I&#x27;m at a point where I use a very small amount of this conditioner and am getting great results.  Even though this is more expensive that many of the other Suave conditioning products, I will definitely be buying it again because a little goes a long way!  I&#x27;m  not sure what the difference is.  I don&#x27;t actually know what Moroccan argan oil is, but maybe that&#x27;s it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the color care aspect, I honestly have yet to find a shampoo or conditioner that I feel impacts the length of color.  The same is true with this product.</li>
    <li> Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Color Care Conditioner.  Perfect.  No complaints.  Suave is a trusted name brand that I&#x27;ve been using all my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use color, I would highly recommend this conditioner.  I love conditioner.  I love to pamper myself.  I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without my conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.  You can always trust Suave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner and the shampoo of the same product line for a couple of weeks now and I like it. I use about a quarter-sized dollop of product on my wet shoulder-length fine, dry hair after shampooing. It seems to penetrate quickly so I don&#x27;t have to leave it on for a long time to get the moisturizing effect. It smells vaguely musky but is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do color my hair at home using a variety of products, and that process leaves my hair a bit more dry than usual. Add to it the fact that it is winter and that results in my hair needing some intensive care and moisture. I want clean, soft, smooth hair without static or flyaway ends. Also don&#x27;t want a greasy look that you sometimes can get using products made for processed hair. This conditioner works well for me and I am happy with the way my hair looks and feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Wow, this makes my hair feel so soft and silky! It instantly smooths my wet hair when I put it on. I love how it makes my hair feel. When I dry my hair, it looks like I&#x27;ve gone to the salon and had a shiny smoothing treatment put on. It really works well to add shine and smooth out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the scent really bothers me. It actually makes me a bit queasy when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used the Moroccan Infusion shampoo by Suave and I have the same problem with the scent. It must be the Moroccan oil my tummy can&#x27;t handle in the early mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m bummed because I really love how this conditioner and the shampoo makes my hair feel and look. I just can not get past the scent.</li>
</ol>
