      <li>This Dtox system is great and the small sizes are convenient for travel or just to overnight.</li>
      <li>My expectations were a bit high, so many of the reviews I read before purchasing claimed this system would cleanse pores without stripping your face of natural oils and drying it out.</li>
      <li>Thanks!  </li>
      <li>I have only been using it for 3 days now, and I am pleased.</li>
      <li>It was fancy and fun at first, but I noticed no difference after using the product up completely.</li>
      <li>don;t know if I would buy it again, i have the large sizes</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used the mask a couple of times and it&#x27;s fine.</li>

      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>The lotion seems really watery, but actually works very well.</li>

      <li>, my skin is dry, itchy, irritated and feels rough, but after using for a week my pores are even more clogged and it made me break out.</li>
      <li>my skin has never been so clear.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this kit, so I won&#x27;t say much.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m quite surprised.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Moisturizer is ok but love the 2 face washes enough to consider full size purchase, and to try other products  in line, you won&#x27;t be disappointed, bought this for home.</li>
      <li>The scrub helped a little, but then the moisturizer was just like oil sitting on top of, but not absorbing into, my skin.</li>
      <li>and this clears my skin up fast and doesn&#x27;t leave it dry.</li>
      <li>I have had recent acne issues due to hormones and bc pills, and this face wash is helping to clear it right on up.</li>
      <li>the scrub and mask are my absolute fave out of any other product ever.</li>

<li> You get a few face cleansers, a tube for masks, and lotion.</li>
<li> A little bit goes allllooonnnnggg way!</li>
<li> I absolutely HATED the cleanser (step one)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Product and shipping as stated. Very easy interaction</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. It was fancy and fun at first, but I noticed no difference after using the product up completely. So glad I didn&#x27;t buy the full size bottles!</li>
    <li> I took this on a recent trip abroad, perfect packaging , and great for testing out the product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this kit, so I won&#x27;t say much. It&#x27;s awesome and perfect for traveling. THANK YOU for making this!!!!!! Love it all. Only stuff that doesn&#x27;t make me face break out or burn, etc. etc.</li>
    <li> The program is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;IT MADE MY SKIN SOFTER!!!&lt;br /&gt;Get it all! You won&#x27;t be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;You will never leave home without it...or BE HOME without it! ^_^&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my 50s and people don&#x27;t believe me...my wrinkles have faded &amp; I&#x27;ve only used it for 6 months.</li>
    <li> I enjoy steps 1 and 2 but 3 makes my face shiny! I&#x27;ve only used the mask once but no complaints. Overall its a great product. A little bit goes allllooonnnnggg way!</li>
    <li> Great way to try all the products. Face wash and scrub and mask-worked well on my teen daughter&#x27;s face. She has eczema and has some allergies to many ingredients in products- this was perfect for her, stron without being over drying or harsh. We then bought regular size of all the face product.</li>
    <li> I love the Giovanni product lines. This Dtox system is great and the small sizes are convenient for travel or just to overnight.</li>
    <li> The product was great and it made it so convenient for traveling , everything you need in one package, cleanser, scrub, moisturizer and a mask. Loved it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this system before committing to the full size ones. I absolutely love it! Works great and my skin looks great! I am in my 40&#x27;s and still occasionally break out and this clears my skin up fast and doesn&#x27;t leave it dry.</li>
    <li> cleared up a huge breakout, the scrub and mask are my absolute fave out of any other product ever. moisturizer is a little oily but overall not bad since i have dry skin, but the kit toned down my redness, even out my dry spots and complexion and cleared my skin.</li>
    <li> My expectations were a bit high, so many of the reviews I read before purchasing claimed this system would cleanse pores without stripping your face of natural oils and drying it out. I absolutely HATED the cleanser (step one), my skin is dry, itchy, irritated and feels rough, but after using for a week my pores are even more clogged and it made me break out. The scrub helped a little, but then the moisturizer was just like oil sitting on top of, but not absorbing into, my skin. The only thing I liked about this system was the mask, it helped clean my pores and moisturize my skin. The only time my skin wasn&#x27;t irritated after using the cleanser was when I used the mask afterwards. Oddly enough, the only reason I bought the whole system to begin with was because I wanted to try the mask but figured that for the price of one bottle of the mask, I could try the whole system! I regret that decision, should have just gotten a regular sized bottle of the mask alone. Everything else I have ever used from Giovanni was delightful, this is the first time I have ever been dissatisfied with any of their products and I&#x27;m quite surprised. Steps 1-3 of the charcoal D-tox system are the only thing I don&#x27;t recommend from Giovanni!</li>
    <li> I tried their mint tea tree shampoo bodywash kit first while travelling and liked it very much, I love love this one, awesome value, natural. Mask isnt thick slides on thin and washes well, not overdrying nice for summer and clogged pores.

    <li> Fast shipping. Everything was received as noted without issue. Will definitely purchase again as this is the perfect travel size for these products.</li>
    <li> handy travel size something non toxic to put on your skin when you are traveling, don;t know if I would buy it again, i have the large sizes</li>
    <li> Perfect size for traveling and gym! Clean smell and gets my face clean. Love it. I need five more words for this to go through!</li>
    <li> I love this kit. It makes my face feel so good. I have sensitive skin this did not irritate my face at all. I defiantly recommend this facial kit.</li>
    <li> I just received this order and I am already enjoying it. It feels good and leaves my skin really smooth. I have only been using it for 3 days now, and I am pleased. I use Giovanni hair products, so I figure why not try the face wash too. I would recommend buying this. Especially to test a product. The size is great and you don&#x27;t need to use much at all so this will last me some time. I have had recent acne issues due to hormones and bc pills, and this face wash is helping to clear it right on up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried their bar soap and these liquid soaps are just as good. You get a few face cleansers, a tube for masks, and lotion. The lotion seems really watery, but actually works very well. They smell really good too. Will definitly purchase again!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  I&#x27;ve tried lots of facial products and this blows others away.  my skin has never been so clear.  The only thing I wish is that the lotion had an SPF, then this product would be perfect.</li>
    <li> Love this travel kit -- all my favorite organic products in airplane friendly sizes.  Thanks!  I will order this again!</li>
    <li> Since I began using this system I have noticed a difference in my skin texture and tone. I use the scrub every other day.</li>
    <li> Love this kit! It was a great way to try out the products before investing in the full size. The kit would be awesome for a trip. The smell is clean and the products cleanse, exfoliate, and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I like the size, I&#x27;m trying this product out for the first time and there is enough for at least a 6 week trial. I love the soap and the scrub. The smell and texture are wonderful and I feel clean not stripped when I use them. I&#x27;ve only used the mask a couple of times and it&#x27;s fine. I find the moisturizer a little greasy though. It took forever to arrive though. I really don&#x27;t dig Amazon Prime that takes weeks to ship.</li>
