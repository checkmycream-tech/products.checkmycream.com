      <li>Nice product.</li>

      <li>Love this hair dryer.</li>
      <li>and now that I&#x27;ve found an even better replacement</li>
      <li>It dries quickly, my hair is shiny, full of body and happy.  </li>
      <li>I have a Croc flat iron and it works wonderful with taming my frizz (even with no product in my hair).  </li>
      <li>I replaced my cheap Revlon one and so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>Happy withe drier, purchase two t3 driers prior, love the croc.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a dryer that gets the job done quick, it&#x27;s also very light weight.</li>
      <li>I have fine, blond, highlighted hair</li>
      <li>and was exactly what i wanted :) plus they threw in a free sample too :)</li>
      <li>Very very useful, as your hair does not feel damaged, burned, or frizzy after.</li>
      <li>Very powerful dryer, lots of airflow, but doesn&#x27;t scorch your head with three temperature settings.</li>
      <li>Really worth the money!</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m finding that even just using the positive ion button my hair is looking healthy and gives me the volume</li>
      <li>I love the many different setting for heat.  </li>
      <li>It arrived really quickly too.</li>
      <li>This blow dryer is phenomenal for getting my hair pretty straight with the assistance of a brush.  </li>
      <li>My hairstylist uses this brand, I should have started with this one first!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lite leaves your hair looking shinny and works fast!!</li>
      <li>Honestly my $12 conair hair dryer works the same.</li>
      <li>but i liked it enough to order it again!</li>
      <li>Delivery was right on schedule.  </li>
      <li>Much better than my previous ones.....gets hotter and blows out more air....</li>
      <li>Nice long cord, too.</li>
      <li>I have super curly hair and have always dreaded drying my hair straight.</li>
      <li>Thanks Croc!</li>
      <li>The shaft doenst get too hot</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>&quot; any more than just taking proper care of your hair would,</li>
      <li>got my item fast!</li>
      <li>It dries the hair more quickly than my other dryers and leaves it lustrous, soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>The weight is heavier than those new light weight dryers but works fine for me since I have short hair.</li>
      <li>Love the long cord, a bit more quiet than my older dryer, feels sturdy and well-built.  </li>
      <li>(Guys this is great when your already running behind because her hair isn&#x27;t done.)</li>
      <li>and this really makes it look so much straighter and shinier.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
      <li>Have I mentioned how much she likes it?</li>
      <li>This dryer is lightweight, powerful, and has a super long cord.</li>
      <li>I have tried many other brands and this seems to work well for my hair type.  </li>
      <li>Honestly I would like some instructions on when to use the positive and negative ions.  </li>
      <li>If you are a more natural hair care user like me and do not use silicone or other heat protecting sprays, positive ions keep your hair in greatcondition.</li>
      <li>Had purchased the Rowenta (costing more than twice as much) but had to return it because it was so heavy.  </li>
      <li>to my older hair dryer breaking</li>
      <li>I got to say I was took back by at how wonderfully better this Croc product works compaired to a regular dryer.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>My hair seems to feel more healthy and not as dry after using the Croc Ball dryer on it&#x27;s (-)Negative Ion setting.</li>
      <li>3 heat settings, 2 power settings and cold shot button are very good.</li>
      <li>but like to have full makeup &amp;  hair done everyday, in a quick manner,  and the CROC dryer is something I would never want to live without again.  </li>
      <li>Plus the cord on this one is more  heavy duty</li>
      <li>For someone who has thick hair this is awesome, it used to take 30 minutes to dry, after she let it air dry for a while.</li>
      <li>This dryer is light and drys my hair faster than any other dryer I have owned.</li>
      <li>I asked my hairstylist for a recommendation before purchasing a new blowdryer and this is the one she recommended.  </li>
      <li>I am a VERY busy mom of 5 kids</li>
      <li>Can switch from positive to negative ions easily.</li>
      <li>I live near the humid Texas coast, so I need all the help I can get.  </li>
      <li>I have never owned a professional hairdryer before &amp; WOW!  </li>
      <li>It has the positive and negative ions options, does a quality job, light weight,the buttons work well</li>
      <li>This one I&#x27;ve been using for 2 months now; I don&#x27;t love it, it does the job but takes longer to dry than my other one</li>
      <li>This blow dryer leaves my hair soft and not frizzy.  </li>
      <li>Ok.. so my hair is naturally curly &amp; frizzy.  </li>
      <li>i am a professional hair styllist and i use this dryer at work.  </li>
      <li>I have course hair and am going natural.  </li>
      <li>Dryer is not too loud.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> LOVE this dryer. I have thick, coarse, curly hair. This dryer is perfect for straightening hair very fast. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a dryer that gets the job done quick, it&#x27;s also very light weight.</li>
    <li> The is the best quality hair dryer! Also, Croc (Turboion) couldn&#x27;t have a better customer service! I&#x27;ve recently tried 3 different expensive hair dryers and was not at all satisfied until I bought this Croc Designer AC hair dryer. It has the positive and negative ions options, does a quality job, light weight,the buttons work well and I can tell it&#x27;s leaving my hair healthier than ever. The negative ions are suppose to close the shafts and leave the hair shiny but I&#x27;m finding that even just using the positive ion button my hair is looking healthy and gives me the volume I want).[[ASIN:B0044DYBMC Croc Designer AC Ceramic Ball Dryer]]Prior to my older hair dryer breaking and now that I&#x27;ve found an even better replacement I&#x27;m once again getting many compliments on my hair - may hair is thick, shoulder length white with streaks of darker low lights. Gael Geniesse</li>
    <li> loved it would buy again!</li>
    <li> If I could go back, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it. The buttons are in a weird location. The dryer is so heavy and the cord is way to long. I like a long cord, but this is extreme. It still takes me 30 mins to dry my hair. Honestly my $12 conair hair dryer works the same. So disappointed for the money that I spend on this dryer. The dryer does help contain the frizz in my hair so that&#x27;s why I am giving it two stars.</li>
    <li> Ok.. so my hair is naturally curly &amp; frizzy.  I live near the humid Texas coast, so I need all the help I can get.  I have a Croc flat iron and it works wonderful with taming my frizz (even with no product in my hair).  I thought I would try their blow dryer, but ugh, it did not work as well as other less expensive hair dryers i&#x27;ve had.  It still took 30+ minutes to dry my hair with this croc hair dryer and then within a couple hours, my hair was already frizzin&#x27; - and i was still inside!!  I returned it and went to Sally&#x27;s to get a ceramic/ionic dryer... it works ok.  I want to try the Babybliss one or even Sedu.  But for now, I have my $50 sally one...</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I love my dryer!  I did my research before purchasing and  what I found is that the T3 hairdryer was rated one of the best.  The price was so expensive though.  So I went to my hairdresser on which one to buy; the CROC or the T3?  She uses Croc products on my hair and turned me onto the Croc flatiron I own (which I LOVE!).  Anyway, when I told her that I didn&#x27;t know if I should go with a Croc or the T3 hairdryer, she said she also owned the T3...having bought it at a tradeshow.  She said it was a great hairdryer too.  However, for what I want out of my hairdryer, the Croc would be the best.  I have thick hair and live in  humid weather for 9 months out of the year.  I don&#x27;t know if the hairdryer gives  \\&quot;shine\\&quot; any more than just taking proper care of your hair would, but I find that before my final styling with the flatiron, my hair is less frizzy with the CROC.  I also am not kidding when I say that I can get my hair dryed in 1/2 the time.  I have never owned a professional hairdryer before &amp; WOW!  Talk about speedy!  I am a VERY busy mom of 5 kids but like to have full makeup &amp;  hair done everyday, in a quick manner,  and the CROC dryer is something I would never want to live without again.  If it broke down tomorrow, I would  replace it IMMEDIATELY.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> got my item fast! and was exactly what i wanted :) plus they threw in a free sample too :)</li>
    <li> I have long not thick but a lot of hair and curly underneath, old dryer took for ever to dry, this dryer less than 10 mins and it makes my hair soft and straightens, no fly away hair.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer. Have had it for almost a year, and still works. Can switch from positive to negative ions easily. Very very useful, as your hair does not feel damaged, burned, or frizzy after. If you are a more natural hair care user like me and do not use silicone or other heat protecting sprays, positive ions keep your hair in greatcondition. Little bit of negative at the roots and you get volume. Can do all temperatures, and high speed is not a hurricane of crazy. Nozel attaches on, so it is not falling off, and still can be turned in any direction. Super long thick round cord. Weight does not bother me at all. At home user, not a professional.</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer!!  This is my second one as I have one at home and one for travel.  You will LOVE this dryer!</li>
    <li> I have always used regular inexpspensive hair dryers, but never a professional one. I got to say I was took back by at how wonderfully better this Croc product works compaired to a regular dryer. My hair seems to feel more healthy and not as dry after using the Croc Ball dryer on it&#x27;s (-)Negative Ion setting. Thanks Croc!</li>
    <li> Excellent Product....Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Excellent blow dryer.  Much better than my previous ones.....gets hotter and blows out more air....but pricey,  Amazon had the best price online and off line.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> This dryer is lightweight, powerful, and has a super long cord. It dries the hair more quickly than my other dryers and leaves it lustrous, soft and smooth. The price was about half of retail on this model. It arrived really quickly too. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I asked my hairstylist for a recommendation before purchasing a new blowdryer and this is the one she recommended.  I see why.  As soon as you hold it in your hand you can feel that it is solidly constructed and w-a-a-a-y different from a blowdryer you would  buy at a drugstore, for example.  It dries quickly, my hair is shiny, full of body and happy.  I have fine, blond, highlighted hair and I am extremely careful about using heat from appliances on it, but this dryer actually makes my hair feel healthier than it does if I air dry it.  I love it!  Nice long cord, too.</li>
    <li> I got this hairdryer based on the good reviews. I guess I am biased because I love my other dryer more, but unfortunately it broke down after 5 months of use. This one I&#x27;ve been using for 2 months now; I don&#x27;t love it, it does the job but takes longer to dry than my other one and it is quite heavy.</li>
    <li> One disclaimer, this is the best dryer my wife has owned. She purchased to replace another Croc that she had been using for the past 5 years. This is the best dryer she claims to have ever used! For someone who has thick hair this is awesome, it used to take 30 minutes to dry, after she let it air dry for a while. Now it&#x27;s dry in 10 minutes tops out of the shower. (Guys this is great when your already running behind because her hair isn&#x27;t done.) Very powerful dryer, lots of airflow, but doesn&#x27;t scorch your head with three temperature settings. We ended up purchasing a second one as a gift. Have I mentioned how much she likes it?</li>
    <li> Blow Dryer settings are great. 3 heat settings, 2 power settings and cold shot button are very good. Dryer is not too loud. My conair dryer was way louder than this one. The weight is heavier than those new light weight dryers but works fine for me since I have short hair. The dry time is cut in half for me as well.</li>
    <li> Happy withe drier, purchase two t3 driers prior, love the croc. I am a hairdresser and the drier is wonderful. Good buy ...</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this hair dryer!  Had purchased the Rowenta (costing more than twice as much) but had to return it because it was so heavy.  It had a lot of nice features to it (3 speeds, 3 heat settings and a cold shot)  but so does this one, and at 1/3 the weight!  Plus the cord on this one is more  heavy duty, looks like it should last longer.  My hairstylist uses this brand, I should have started with this one first!  Highly recommend this hair dryer, very happy with it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love this!! It&#x27;s lite leaves your hair looking shinny and works fast!! And it was shipped as promised can not complain</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is AMAZING! Really worth the money!</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended this to me. I love her for it!! I have super curly hair and have always dreaded drying my hair straight. Since I bought this, I dry my hair straight all the time!</li>
    <li> This dryer is great. It leaves a nice shine on my hair.  Honestly I would like some instructions on when to use the positive and negative ions.  So the product could use some instructions, but it still does a nice job on my hair.  The shaft doenst get too hot so I can hold it while I blow dry.  Nice product.</li>
    <li> THIS DRYER IS  REALLY  GOOD, GOOD FOR TRAVEL AND FOR HOME USE. I TRAVEL A LOT AND GIVES ME A GOOD SERVICE.</li>
    <li> This dryer is light and drys my hair faster than any other dryer I have owned. My hair is easier to style using this dryer.  My stylist uses it when she styles my hair. She also recommended it. The 12 foot cord allows me flexibality in movement.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer leaves my hair soft and not frizzy.  Of course I do put a serum on before blow drying, but it used to take me 15-20 mins and now it only takes 7 mins.  Love the long cord, a bit more quiet than my older dryer, feels sturdy and well-built.  I replaced my cheap Revlon one and so glad I did.  I only wish they would send info on the positive and negative ions so that I know which setting to use.  I now look forward to blow drying my hair and in the past I dreaded it.  Thank you Croc!</li>
    <li> I have course hair and am going natural.  I recently got a Global Keratin treatment to assist with loosening my curl pattern.  This blow dryer is phenomenal for getting my hair pretty straight with the assistance of a brush.  I love the many different setting for heat.  Also, this dryer is not as loud as my previous dryer.  Provided it lasts a while (as I have only used it 3-4 times), I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is my second Croc Blow-dryer and I still think it&#x27;s the best.  I have tried many other brands and this seems to work well for my hair type.  I have coarse, curly hair and this really makes it look so much straighter and shinier.  Delivery was right on schedule.  Very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> i am a professional hair styllist and i use this dryer at work.  i love it!! i had one before and dropped it.  but i liked it enough to order it again!</li>
