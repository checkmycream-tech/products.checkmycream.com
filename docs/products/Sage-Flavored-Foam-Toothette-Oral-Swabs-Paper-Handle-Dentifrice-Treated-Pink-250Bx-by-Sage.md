      <li>They leave the mouth fresh and with a pleasant breath.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve used them for years and love them.</li>
      <li>but still I check it every time I use it just to make sure.</li>
      <li>He died before many could be used.</li>
      <li>these were purchase for my mother-in-law (she is a Private duty nurse) and needed them for a patient - she says they are wonderful and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Originally we bought it to apply some oral medicine and it made it very easy.</li>
      <li>My son is special needs!</li>
      <li>Worked out fine.  </li>
      <li>Toothette Oral Swabs received as stated; and, packaged securely.  </li>
      <li>The tip is stuck nicely to the stick and does not separate as a whole</li>
      <li>I order these for my daughters they eat through feeding tubes so these are so important o keep th mouth moist.</li>
      <li>I use this product to clean my childs mouth after the use of his inhaler, it meets expectations for a disposable</li>
      <li>Bigger and sturdier and good price.</li>
      <li>Look around for the best price because pricing is different for different sites.</li>
      <li>My friend&#x27;s son has Prader Willy and is incapable of drinking or eating on his own, however, with these swabs he is able to moisten them and let the little guy gnaw on them.  </li>
      <li>She can&#x27;t swallow thin liquids, so using these to rinse her mouth after brushing works perfectly.  </li>
      <li>this product is doing a great job not only cleaning her teeth but letting me add some extra water in her mouth.</li>
      <li>Worked better to just get the big box seeing as hubby uses them ever day 2 or 3 times a day.</li>
      <li>This product was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>These were exactly what we wanted-</li>
      <li>I will say the cost of buying toothettes locally is quite a bit more than buying from Amazon.</li>
      <li>They were better than I expected.</li>
      <li>My dog really likes to brush his teeth now.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t expect to receive then that fast.</li>
      <li>They are just perfect for him as toothpaste is impossible to get out of his mouth.  </li>
      <li>but my wife uses them and they are the same as I paid many time for at a local drug store.  </li>
      <li>This 250 pack cost a little more that twice</li>
      <li>We use them for my daughters dry mouth, to clean out her mouth and oral stem.</li>
      <li>We first got introduced to these in the hospital and couldn&#x27;t find anywhere else to buy them locally.  </li>
      <li>I really appreciate they are individually wrapped.  </li>
      <li>The brush is soft and flexible so I can slide it between his teeth and over his gums without scratching.</li>
      <li>I use this oral swabs on my 10 year old child who is learning how to swallow after her accident.</li>
      <li>but since these are soft I don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally hurting her in the process.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery, I definitely buy it  again.</li>
      <li>Our beloved black Labrador has chronic gum disease and needs to have his teeth brushed everyday.</li>
      <li>I use then for cleaning my babies mouth, they take away the hard saliva really easy , they are great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>we are using a soft toothbrush and following with these sponges for rinsing.  </li>
      <li>My wife loves them very helpful when you are unable to brush your teeth due to an illness they come in handy</li>
      <li>Knowing the cost to glue a sponge on a little stick can&#x27;t cost but pennies, I feel the retail price is way too much.</li>

    <li> They are oral swabs.  I do not know anything about oral swabs but my wife uses them and they are the same as I paid many time for at a local drug store.  This 250 pack cost a little more that twice what a 12 pack cost at my local drug store.  Excellent buy.</li>
    <li> These were exactly what we wanted- and when our insurance wouldn&#x27;t pay for them, I felt like it was an affordable perice!!</li>
    <li> I first came across these little oral hygiene sticks when a family member was ill. They are so helpful in keeping a sick person&#x27;s mouth clean and moist. When we were dismissed from the hospital there were a few left that got packed up and ended up at my house.    Our beloved black Labrador has chronic gum disease and needs to have his teeth brushed everyday. I have tried a variety of toothbrushes, gauze pads, beauty pads,soft clothes, etc, in an effort to get something that works well. I got to looking at these, checked out the ingredients in relation to dogs, (They have a bit of manitol in them, but I looked it up and dogs can have that)  and decided to try using one on him. These Sage Toothettes are perfect! The brush is soft and flexible so I can slide it between his teeth and over his gums without scratching. It holds a lot of water so I can squeeze it out over any sore spots to give them extra rinsing.    I don&#x27;t use a new one everyday. I let them air dry and use until the cardboard stick starts to peel and get limp. My dog really likes to brush his teeth now. These have been a great discovery!</li>
    <li> This is the same as the ones we got at 250 to a box so this wasn&#x27;t something we wanted to do. Worked better to just get the big box seeing as hubby uses them ever day 2 or 3 times a day.</li>
    <li> I use then for cleaning my babies mouth, they take away the hard saliva really easy , they are great!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect to receive then that fast.</li>

    <li> My daughter is totally disabled from an accident when she was 9.  She can&#x27;t swallow thin liquids, so using these to rinse her mouth after brushing works perfectly.  We can squeeze enough water out of it before swabbing her mouth so she can control what she needs to spit out.  We&#x27;ve used them for years and love them.</li>
    <li> Worked out fine.  Saved a bunch as opposed to buying them at the local drugstore.</li>
    <li> The sponge is good, but the paper stick falls apart and bends after one rinse. The stick is also too short to get to the back of throat. Won&#x27;t get them again.</li>
    <li> So many and very happy with!!</li>
    <li> I haver to use them for my Mother who has ALZ  and can not speak or does not have any functions.&lt;br /&gt;I keep her mouth cleaned out. What a great item to use</li>
    <li> My son is special needs! We first got introduced to these in the hospital and couldn&#x27;t find anywhere else to buy them locally.  It works great &amp; helps clean around his gums and the fact it is also great for oral stimulation. I&#x27;ve been purchasing from Sage now whenever we run out and haven&#x27;t had any issues with the supplier.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for.  The price was half of that of the local retailer.  All good!!</li>
    <li> my step mom loved the favor!!</li>

    <li> good product as advertised.</li>
    <li> My grandpa can&#x27;t drink water, and this is good to keep his  mouth moist and clean!</li>
    <li> she didn&#x27;t like the taste.</li>
    <li> I love this product I used to clean my gums after I removed my dentures its great to used for oral care when gums are sore after.root canal or extraction.</li>
    <li> I  have been using these toothettes for years for my handicapped son.  They are just perfect for him as toothpaste is impossible to get out of his mouth.  The handles are sturdy and don&#x27;t bend when wet.  The foam stays on the handle also.  I don&#x27;t have a bad thing to say about these!</li>
    <li> It worked well for my patience. The delivery time was excellent. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I use this product to clean my childs mouth after the use of his inhaler, it meets expectations for a disposable</li>
    <li> My father has used toothettes for a long time.  The product itself serves the needs of my father.  Knowing the cost to glue a sponge on a little stick can&#x27;t cost but pennies, I feel the retail price is way too much. I will say the cost of buying toothettes locally is quite a bit more than buying from Amazon. Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> Perfect for moisturizing and cleaning my bedridden moms mouth. Look around for the best price because pricing is different for different sites.</li>
    <li> My wife loves them very helpful when you are unable to brush your teeth due to an illness they come in handy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product and the services.  Will order again in the future</li>
    <li> I use these on my mother.  They do not do the job of a toothbrush, but they help when we are unable to do more.</li>
    <li> I use this oral swabs on my 10 year old child who is learning how to swallow after her accident. this product is doing a great job not only cleaning her teeth but letting me add some extra water in her mouth. Also the foam has not come apart at all. Fast delivery, I definitely buy it  again.</li>
    <li> We use them for my daughters dry mouth, to clean out her mouth and oral stem. I am very happy with the price they are exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> For a senior who needs help cleaning around gums after eating. These are great. These foam swabs are very hard to find. None of the local stores have them. So I am very happy to find them on this site.</li>
    <li> I order these for my daughters they eat through feeding tubes so these are so important o keep th mouth moist.</li>
    <li> Good product for those who might tend to bite a toothbrush.  Keeps it sanitary also.  I use this product regularly.</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor ordered</li>
    <li> Wow, great price, great service!!! I buy these for my brain injured son, but now I can get them half off.  So happy I found these on here and they came the next day too. Will only buy them from here from now on!!!</li>
    <li> These work great, but pose as a choking hazard as the sponge can easily come off.</li>
    <li> Defintely NOT Toothette brand.  Wish they wouldn&#x27;t use the brand in the product title, similar to Kleenex...</li>
    <li> These sponges help keep oral hygiene going in elderly patient who has a low tolerance for toothpaste and toothbrushes. I use them with a good mouthwash and it keeps the germs at bay.</li>
    <li> We have used these with our daughter since she was a baby.  She has been tube fed her entire life and has had a severe oral aversion her entire life.  Brushing is always stressful but since these are soft I don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally hurting her in the process.  Now that she is 3 we are using a soft toothbrush and following with these sponges for rinsing.  She tolerates these well now.  Just a word of precaution though...the sponges can come off or be bitten off so supervision is always necessary to prevent choking.</li>
    <li> They were better than I expected. Bigger and sturdier and good price. He died before many could be used. The swabs did not kill him.</li>
    <li> the paper handle was a bit short</li>
