      <li>and my skin feels much more moisturized.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too grainy/harsh like most scrubs.</li>
      <li>Heard about this on the Today Show from one of the hosts and they love and I have to agree.</li>
      <li>Makes my legs nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>Love love love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wondering if thats more to do with the oils in the product rather than the exfoliation.</li>
      <li>then what I was expecting, but still works just fine.</li>
      <li>but it was too fine.</li>
      <li>left skin feeling great.  </li>
      <li>Smells fabulous</li>
      <li>Once out of the shower I then applied the Righteous Body Butter, and my legs have been silky smooth and itch-free since I used it.  </li>

      <li>I live soap and glory, their stuff smells amazing and works like a dream.</li>
      <li>My skin feel super smooth all day.</li>
      <li>I loved it so much I bought the whole line.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I loved it so much I bought the whole line.</li>
      <li>This is nothing special.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s nothing special about this stuff</li>
      <li>I think it would be better if it was a little more effective in the crystals</li>
      <li>It smells nice, but that&#x27;s pretty much it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i Love this product so much</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite of the soap and glory products.</li>
      <li>THIS ORDER HERE TOOK A FULL MONTH TO GET TO ME.</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, and the smell is wonderful, not too strong, light, and lovely.</li>
      <li>The micro beads and sugar disolve in water really quickly though</li>
      <li>but I would LOVE to use it everyday since it makes my skin so nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>This stuff is really good for clearing dry skin, but you have to keep using it.</li>
      <li>This is worth 5 stars alone.</li>
      <li>Its worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Soap and Glory is such a fun brand and their products are really effective as well.</li>
      <li>The only problem I have is it smells a tad manly; almost like a sexy man rubbed all over my legs.</li>
      <li>I love this entire product line.</li>
      <li>Most items never live up to how they are advertised, but his one does.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little on the old-fashioned side, kind of perfumey.  </li>
      <li>I am very picky when it comes to scrubs, and I like this scrub.  </li>
      <li>Also, its very creamy and moisturizing but did not leave my skin oily.</li>
      <li>but it gets the job done in a gentle way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>product smells very good&lt;</li>
      <li>The scrubby things really do dissolve and DON&#x27;T just sit on the skin.  </li>
      <li>, packaging is cute, and upon opening it up the smell blew me away, the container says peach and some other extracts</li>
      <li>The more I used it the less</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are much better smelling ones that you can get delivered in half the time.</li>
      <li>I may have high expectations, but this product didn&#x27;t meet them.  </li>
      <li>I had skin flaking everywhere and constant dry spots onto my shirt, after using this scrub on my neck once every 3 days, it completely stopped the flaking, IT SMELLS AMAZING, and moisturized my neck.  </li>
      <li>I gave it four stars because I was expecting a little more of the scrub material in it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little more runny</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it especially for the price.</li>
      <li>Not awesome, but pretty darn good.</li>
      <li>, it eventually just becomes a lotion so its better to wet the area first and use dry hands to exfoliate.</li>
      <li>Lol .. the only thing i don&#x27;t like it is the smell doesn&#x27;t still long time -less than an hour</li>
      <li>Initially discovered it in the UK and was thrilled to find it in Target a few years back, however they apparently dropped the line, so I was stoked to find it again on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It is a little heavy and doesn&#x27;t contain enough pumice for my liking but still a good product.</li>
      <li>New England winters are so rough on my skin, and this particularly never-ending winter is no exception.  </li>
      <li>Left my skin soft and the scent lingered even after rinsed off (woohoo!).</li>
      <li>It barely scrubs.</li>
      <li>Now after only a week of exfoliating, I am back to my soft legged self.</li>

    <li> left skin feeling great.  Heard about this on the Today Show from one of the hosts and they love and I have to agree.</li>
    <li> Great !!  Smells fabulous</li>
    <li> i think every girl in the planet should have this scrub!&lt;br /&gt;smells AMAZING and i wanna eat it - i know i&#x27;m weird Lol .. the only thing i don&#x27;t like it is the smell doesn&#x27;t still long time -less than an hour and it&#x27;s sadly disappear</li>
    <li> Great product, leaves skin smooth, nice scent.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells wonderful and does a great job.</li>
    <li> After moving back from the UK, I was without Soap and Glory for over a year! Torture. Now after only a week of exfoliating, I am back to my soft legged self.</li>
    <li> Not awesome, but pretty darn good. Bit pricy.</li>
    <li> Good scrub, but the fragrance is too strong.</li>
    <li> I am very picky when it comes to scrubs, and I like this scrub.  It is a little heavy and doesn&#x27;t contain enough pumice for my liking but still a good product.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and am always looking for something that works.  Most items never live up to how they are advertised, but his one does.  I have used it twice and my skin feels much more moisturized.  I plan on trying other products in this line.</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff. Sephora are fools to discontinue</li>
    <li> This is one of the best scrubs you will ever buy.  Period.  The scrub part truly removes dead skin on normal parts of the body.&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizing is superior.  The only tiny problem I have with this is the scent. It&#x27;s a little on the old-fashioned side, kind of perfumey.  The scrubby things really do dissolve and DON&#x27;T just sit on the skin.  This is worth 5 stars alone.</li>
    <li> After reading so many great reviews I thought it would be worth a shot. It made me break out on my chest &amp; back. Not cool! The smell is wonderful but very strong &amp; gave me headaches. I noticed a slight softness to my skin as with any soap but not enough to make me spend the money on this again. There&#x27;s nothing special about this stuff and it&#x27;s not worth the price or the time you have to wait for it to arrive from the UK.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite of the soap and glory products. Exfoliates well and smells GLORIOUS. Leaves a nice soft sheen on skin, that moisturizes beautiful. Not to mention that you smell fabuloussssss.....Absolutely fabulous.......!</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff! Excellent stuff! This stuff cleans so well. I love this stuff. Soap &amp; Glory products are always the BOMB.COM :)</li>
    <li> I like this body scrub. Don&#x27;t care for the smell but it gets the job done in a gentle way.&lt;br /&gt;I rated it a four because of the not so nice smell and length of time it took for delivery.&lt;br /&gt;There are much better smelling ones that you can get delivered in half the time.</li>
    <li> Has a great smell . this product is Ok but I find that the grains/salts or whatever it is, are too big , coarse and not enough of them in the pot . so you have to scrub longer . I&#x27;m not sure if I am managing to exfoliate, my legs do feel smoother afterwards nd I&#x27;m wondering if thats more to do with the oils in the product rather than the exfoliation. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again I just like a more medium sized scrub</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my legs feel amazing and I feel more beautiful just for owning it. The only problem I have is it smells a tad manly; almost like a sexy man rubbed all over my legs. The more I used it the less I felt that way but at first its a little manly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s January, it&#x27;s Maine, the heat and the fireplace are going all day, I swear my skin is flaking off at the rate of a pound a day, too bad the scale doesn&#x27;t reflect this!  This scrub is my winter salvation, it&#x27;s the best scrub I have found and believe me I have tried too many to count.  &amp;#34;Flake Away&amp;#34; has my 5th. star!</li>
    <li> I live soap and glory, their stuff smells amazing and works like a dream. It&#x27;s not too grainy/harsh like most scrubs. Makes my legs nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> It was a nice smelling scrub, adequently amount for the money, and nice container. Overall, very low on my radar of scurbs.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little more runny then what I was expecting, but still works just fine.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I gave it four stars because I was expecting a little more of the scrub material in it but it was too fine. I think it would be better if it was a little more effective in the crystals but the texture is nice.  Also, its very creamy and moisturizing but did not leave my skin oily.</li>
    <li> Worked amazingly on my dry skin. I had skin flaking everywhere and constant dry spots onto my shirt, after using this scrub on my neck once every 3 days, it completely stopped the flaking, IT SMELLS AMAZING, and moisturized my neck.  I tested to see what would happen if I stopped using it for a month, I got dry skin and flakes again. But it took a month to reform. This stuff is really good for clearing dry skin, but you have to keep using it. The micro beads and sugar disolve in water really quickly though, it eventually just becomes a lotion so its better to wet the area first and use dry hands to exfoliate. Its so moisturizing.</li>
    <li> THIS ORDER HERE TOOK A FULL MONTH TO GET TO ME. I WAS GOING TO RETURN IT SO I WENT TO RETURN AND IT WAS GOING TO COST ME$36.SO I WAS LIKE NO .BUT WHEN I OPENED IT OMG THE SMELL IS SO SO GOOD SO I AM GLAD I KEPT IT .BUT WILL NOT REORDER TAKES A MONTH WAY TO LONG</li>
    <li> I love this entire product line. Initially discovered it in the UK and was thrilled to find it in Target a few years back, however they apparently dropped the line, so I was stoked to find it again on Amazon.  New England winters are so rough on my skin, and this particularly never-ending winter is no exception.  My legs get so flaky and itchy despite my efforts with various body butters, creams, and lotions.  This product is beyond amazing. I used it a few days ago, prior to shaving, and then after after.  Once out of the shower I then applied the Righteous Body Butter, and my legs have been silky smooth and itch-free since I used it.  A little goes a long way, and the smell is wonderful, not too strong, light, and lovely. I don&#x27;t like body washes scrubs that have too strong scented, this scent is a perfect balance.  Get it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good. I love this scent. I liked the exfoliation it gave my skin also. I should have given it five stars.</li>
    <li> This scrub is great. It smells wonderful... Not too perfume-y and I noticed smoother skin after 2 uses.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this brand!</li>
    <li> A nice amount for the price, packaging is cute, and upon opening it up the smell blew me away, the container says peach and some other extracts buT the scent is indescribable in the best way. Left my skin soft and the scent lingered even after rinsed off (woohoo!). A great buy :)</li>
    <li> I may have high expectations, but this product didn&#x27;t meet them.  It smells nice, but that&#x27;s pretty much it.</li>
    <li> Good scent, excellent exfoliation!!  I recommend this product for people with dry, flaky skin &amp; just for summer time use if/when sunburnt skin starts to peel.</li>
    <li> This is nothing special. It barely scrubs. It is moisturizing and smells good but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This product smells heavenly. My skin feels just wonderful after each use. My skin feel super smooth all day. Best exfoliating product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This smells awesome! I try not to use too often but I would LOVE to use it everyday since it makes my skin so nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Soap and Glory is such a fun brand and their products are really effective as well. I was so sad when Target stop selling this brand however I was really excited with Amazon started to sell it. Its worth every penny. I loved it so much I bought the whole line. I like to use this product after a long day of work. It flakes away the day and leaves behind soft kissable skin.</li>
    <li> Flake away is the only one that I use. It is amazing how your skin feels after showering. Using Flake Away as a body wash.</li>
    <li> I loved it so much I bought the whole line.&lt;br /&gt;This product smells very good&lt;br /&gt;i Love this product so much</li>
