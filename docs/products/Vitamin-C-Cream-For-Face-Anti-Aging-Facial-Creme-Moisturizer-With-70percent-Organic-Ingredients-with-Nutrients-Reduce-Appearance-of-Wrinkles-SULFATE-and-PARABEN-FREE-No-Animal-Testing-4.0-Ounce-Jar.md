      <li>I love using it when applying my Vitamin E capsules, as it distributes easily on my face.</li>

      <li>The creme blended easily into my skin</li>
      <li>This face cream is great for people like me who are allergic to most facial creams or what is in them.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a strong chemical smell.</li>
      <li>It will reduce the appearance of fine lines and hyper-pigmented spots on the face; not eliminate them.</li>
      <li>It is all natural, and perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>

      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>It certainly works as well or BETTER than those $200-$400 products you see at the mall.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s all organic, but it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as I&#x27;m accustomed to facial products smelling.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this facial cream for several weeks since it arrived.  I use it as a night creme and have been very happy with the results.  It has left my skin soft and supple in the morning.  I am thrilled the brown spots have almost disappeared and I believe this creme has helped in its reduction.  It is not greasy and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so pleased most of the ingredients are organic and it contains an antioxidant combination.  Also, it does not contain potentially harmful sulfates or parabens.  It is an excellent creme.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, I love it. Great smell and I dont feel sticky after every use. Unlike other face creams this is my absolute favorite. Love love love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this creme for about a week now and I really like it. My face was really dry before and this creme is good for my skin type. It is full of beautiful, organic nutrients and I just know it is good for my face.</li>
    <li> I received this product for a reduced cost with a promotional code.&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time last night and was surprised how soft my skin felt.&lt;br /&gt;This morning I thought the fine lines looked less visible.</li>
    <li> I am always on a quest for high quality skin care that does not cost the earth and this is certainly a great product. I was a little thrown by how loose the product was and have to be very careful when opening the jar but it absorbs into the skin with little or no effort and has not left me with any breakouts typically associated when I try new products. it is light, non greasy and easily absorbed. I wanted to offer my review as I received this at a promotional price but hope to update once I start to see results. Worth a try.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife and she uses it daily. Not that she needs any anti-aging cream, but just as a precaution haha. I was luck to be given a discount coupon for this product to test it.</li>
    <li> I developed peri-oral dermatitis unexpectedly last year and needed to find paraben-free products for my face. This is the first face moisturizer I tried and I think it&#x27;s great. My skin was able to clear up and it&#x27;s stayed clear ever since. Smells good, very creamy but definitely not greasy, I&#x27;m very satisfied.  UPDATE 8/15/15: I purchased this item again and when I received it, the consistency was very thin, almost like whipping cream or half-and-half. I wrote to PBH and received a reply the next day. They sent me a new jar, which was the proper consistency, at no charge to replace my order and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the level of customer service! And I still love the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is definitely hydrating, but I can&#x27;t say that I love the scent.  Maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s all organic, but it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as I&#x27;m accustomed to facial products smelling. It also is a somewhat runny, and I&#x27;m more used to a thicker hydrating cream.</li>
    <li> This cream is best used at night for me.  I have very sensitive skin but have had no irritation so far.  My skin is also dry so the added hydration has helped!  I tried it with Earth &amp; Sea &amp;#34;Muddy Face&amp;#34; and the combination seems to work well together.</li>
    <li> The cream is very smooth and seems to last a long time. I just don&#x27;t like the smell of it.</li>
    <li> After my first order arrived in such poor conditions I was contacted by a lovely CS rep and she was nice enough to send me a replacement and an additional gift.  Needles to say I love it. In just a few days of using it my skin condition has change. I see a better texture and an even skin tone.   I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive so Im very pick what I use.  Left my skin feeling super moisturized and not oily at all.  Love that is does not have a strong smell.  A little goes a long way!  Only down side the lid came cracked on delivery.</li>
    <li> Love the facial cream. Makes my face feel smooth and clean. No oil residue. Ha e not had it long but so far its a great product.</li>
    <li> It is a little runny but once it is on it feels nice and goes on smooth. I like the way it feels however, I do not like the way it smells. The smell is pretty bad and makes me almost not want to use it.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product in exchange for my honest review. I have tried tons of different face creams and am usually dissatisfied with either the texture or how oily it leaves my skin. This Anti-Aging Vitamin C Facial Creme is seriously some of the best stuff on the market. The consistency is lighter than lotion and it doesn&#x27;t take much but it leaves my skin feeling supple and vibrant. I also haven&#x27;t had issues with break outs since i started using this product. The best part about this stuff is It&#x27;s Organic; It consists mostly of cocoa butter, coconut oil, aloe and a large variety of natural oils. I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  second time ordering- paid full price- this product is spectacular and worth every penny- performs better than much more expensive products AND it&#x27;s organic!  DO YOURSELF A FAVOR and treat yourself to a jar once- you&#x27;ll be hooked on healthy for life! Not only that, they send you follow up email on exactly how to store and use. That is so important because it&#x27;s organic without all the preservatives in other products. Following their directions, my first jar lasted almost 6 months and never went rancid.  Packaging is great- plastic safety wrap with a perforated line to make it easy to remove. Totally shrink wrapped.   Review from first jar They aren&#x27;t kidding - a little goes a long way!  I live in the high desert near Mojave and it is dry dry dry. The lite moisturizer I was using didn&#x27;t cut it. I like how they are very honest about being not 100% organic. I find that some 100% organic stuff goes bad after awhile so I also appreciate their &amp;#34;best if used by&amp;#34; date of using with a year of purchase.  I use it in the morning with a Vitamin C serum and Hyaluronic Anti-Aging Serum (from another company) and my face feels great all day. It certainly works as well or BETTER than those $200-$400 products you see at the mall.  It doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance which is great for those who have allergies to fragrance but I personally like some fragrance so I added a few drops of organic lavender oil.  I researched the company a bit and it&#x27;s a mom and pop company who strongly believe in using Filtered &amp; Clean Water, Organic &amp; Non GMO, and Toxin Free Skin &amp; Personal Care products. Regardless of where each of their ingredients originate, they are proud to say that all production and final packaging occurs right here in the good ole&#x27; USA.  I received this product in exchange for an honest review. I was not obligated to say anything positive.</li>
    <li> I received this cream in a couple of days and I love it. It is rich and fluffy but goes on light and makes my skin feel great. I would definitely order it again. I received a discount to try it and write a review.</li>
    <li> Not too heavy but definitely does an amazing job.  I love this entire line of products and the difference it is making in my skin.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free. It smells good and goes on smooth and it&#x27;s vitamin c witch is good for the skin and its antioxidant. I notice my skin more smooth and looks healthier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this new facial cream.  I have found it to be lightweight,  non-greasy, minimal odor, and overall a good moisturizer for my sensitive skin.  My laugh lines and crows feet don&#x27;t seem to look as pronounced, and my facial coloration looks more even.</li>
    <li> My face adores this cream.  A tiny bit goes a long way, and the feeling of moisture lasts all day.  Like a few other reviewers have said, this goes on nicely without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> This face cream is great for people like me who are allergic to most facial creams or what is in them.&lt;br /&gt;so far I like that it is creamy texture and non irritating .</li>
    <li> Really enjoy using this facial creme! It goes on nicely and isn’t to greasy or oily! I like to put it on in the morning after i wake up, and I’ve noticed that it keeps my face moisturized throughout the whole day which is really nice because i tend to get dry skin on my face easily in the summer! Great product would buy again in a heartbeat. I also LOVE that this product uses organic products!</li>
    <li> I was surprised by how fluid the cream was…and realized it flows onto the skin with no tugging at the fragile areas around the eyes because it is not solid.  It has a slight tingling feeling, which is kind of gratifying – feel like it is really working to transform the skin.  I appreciate that there is no odor – nothing to distract from the antioxidant action.  It doesn’t make the pores larger like some creams that in attempting to hydrate actually just flood the skin with oil it can’t absorb.  I like this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice lotion. Thick so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it. I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my skin though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it and waiting for a some results it&#x27;s been a week and i&#x27;m seeing some improvement. I will continue using the product...</li>
    <li> This face cream has a whipped like, creamy texture that feels great on my skin. It is very moisturizing and does not dry out my skin like some other vitamin c products I have tried.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Smell wasn&#x27;t the best and it could have more moisturizer .  Excellent product!!</li>
    <li> This lotion is incredible! It is soothing and tightens at the same time. People have commented on my skin since I have been using this! Highly reccomend!</li>
    <li> I really like the lightweight feel and effect on my skin.</li>
    <li> Such a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve really loved this. I&#x27;m very picky about my creams. And this one was great!</li>
    <li> LOVE!! Been searching for a great moisturizer that is light but effective at hydrating my skin and this is wonderful- so happy I found it! It has a nice, subtle smell, but not overwhelming fragrance like most moisturizers with artificial ingredients. It is all natural, and perfect for my sensitive skin. I use it at night before I go to bed and then I use the serum in the morning. These products are awesome and I love that they are pure, and organic.</li>
    <li> I really like the scent of this...its a yummy almost dessert-like scent...not overpowering but just a light scent that is much better than any other night creams I normally use. (I&#x27;m not fond of the perfumey types and this one is not that) This moisturizer has a cream, luxurious feel that I am now hooked on! And, its not so oily/greasy like some creams - in the morning when I wake up my face is still smooth and feels moisturized without any greasy feel. Definitely a keeper for me!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome facial creme!  It feels so light and not greasy!!  And in the morning, my skin feels so smooth!!</li>
    <li> This is a decent product. I prefer Vitamin C serums because the texture suits me better. I&#x27;m not really into creams, but if you are, you will like this. It goes on smooth, but takes longer to dry. I love that there&#x27;s no greasy residue afterwards and no animal testing like you see with the big companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
    <li> I love love love this facial creme. Its amazing, goes on very nice and smooth. Non greasy, absorbs nicely. Feels really nice on my face and it does not smell like perfume. My new favorite facial creme. I&#x27;m sensitive to so many products. This one is truly what the say, AWESOME!! They have the best customer service. They follow up to make sure if you have any questions. I will buy again once this jar is gone. Well worth every penny. I highly recommend their product and GREAT customer service.</li>
    <li> If you are sensitive to the smell of facial products, you will be completely put off by this. It&#x27;s got a strong chemical smell. If I don&#x27;t breathe while applying it, the smell evaporates in about a minute after application. It does moisturize and &amp;#34;brighten&amp;#34; skin. It will reduce the appearance of fine lines and hyper-pigmented spots on the face; not eliminate them. The price you pay (beyond initial cost) is that the company begins a non-ending, weekly harassment of you asking you to review the product and implying you may not be using the product correctly after they&#x27;ve sent you weekly, bothersome emails. The 1st, asking if the product arrived okay, seemed conscientious. The subsequent emails have become the equivalent of having a digital stalker.</li>
    <li> Jury is still out on whether the product is as great as is promised...but I do like the way my skin feels.</li>
    <li> This item works very well. My skin looks more radiant and I am pleased with the results. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my skin feel great. It moisturizes and tightens. I will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I don&#x27;t use it every day but it is great on your face and neck.  I use it on my hands and arms too.</li>
    <li> So smoothing!  Complexion is definitely improved when using in conjunction with toner spray and Vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;Previous problem with atomizer immediately resolved.  Outstanding customer service!</li>
    <li> when I got it I open it up and it look like itmeltedI didn&#x27;t know if it was supposed to be like that</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is incredible.  Goes on very smooth and not greasy at all.  Does not irritate my sensitive skin and keeps it very moisturized.</li>
    <li> Texture is more like a lotion than a cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using this facial cream for several weeks since it arrived. I use it as a night creme and have been very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Wonderful night creme! I am super sensitive to creme so am very picky about what goes on my face. Best of all, my skin has never been smoother and softer.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and its fun to watch how even the pigment of my skin has become.  I&#x27;m now exploring putting the creme on my shoulders to even out the pigment there from all the suns pots that have built up over the years.  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I really like this cream, it moisturizes without being oily, good for those of us who are stuck with both oily skin and wrinkles</li>
    <li> I just used this Perfect Body Harmony facial cream for the last few days on my face. From the first appearance, I thought it was going to be heavy and greasy. But actually it was very light and didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy or heavy. The creme blended easily into my skin and I only needed a small amount. I am prone to break outs with some moisturizers so I was a little hesitant to use it. So far, my skin&#x27;s appearance has only improved.  Today, one of my co-workers asked what was going on with me as I seemed to be glowing.....Definitely the facial creme.&lt;br /&gt;I was given a discount to provide an honest opinion of this product.</li>
    <li> absorbes quickly, feels like silk marshmallows.  I got this for doing a review.</li>
    <li> So happy with this product!! Unlike other facial cremes, you will recognize most of the ingredients, which are listed on the back of the container.  It makes you feel good to use something so natural and organic on your face. The texture us great and absorbs easily in your skin.  No real fragrance, which I like.  Even my husband wants to use it!!!</li>
    <li> I like this cream, and the way it feels on my face. Recently I went out camping with the whole family, and my 7yr and 10yr old boys really damage their face from sun exposure even though they had sun block.  Their face was peeling and they were complaining of pain. As a mother of 4 children, I knew my job was to do something to make them feel better. I though what can help them and heal their skin quickly? well didn&#x27;t know if it was going to work, but decided to give it a tried for their delicate skin. I use Vitamin C Facial Cream, and there was very noticeable positive results after 1 day, so after day number two it was 95% better. They didn&#x27;t complaint of the skin being irritated even though they are children. The only reason I don&#x27;t give it a five star is because I don&#x27;t rally like the way it smells. I love using it when applying my Vitamin E capsules, as it distributes easily on my face.</li>
    <li> I bought this product primarily to fade sun spots and not as an overall moisturizer. As I have only just started using it I will need more time to see if it does indeed fade sun spots. Apart from that I like the texture of the cream and that it is organic.</li>
    <li> This cream has a lucurious feel and soaks in nicely. As far as I can tell it has kept the wrinkles at bay, but...I really hate the smell. It&#x27;s almost (to me) like a chemically altered nut smell.  Also, I have some pretty dark spots on my face and I can&#x27;t tell that it has altered them at all. I will use it until it is gone, but won&#x27;t be reordering, mostly because I can barely tolerate the smell.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE that these products don&#x27;t add perfumes!  (ones that DO use ingredients that smell terrible, so they have REASON to do so!!)  Perfect Body Harmony seems great so far!  I&#x27;ve only used it for a short while, so will update soon with my thoughts on results.</li>
