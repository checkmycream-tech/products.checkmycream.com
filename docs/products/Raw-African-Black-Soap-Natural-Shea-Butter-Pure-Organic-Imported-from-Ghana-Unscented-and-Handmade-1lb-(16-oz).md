      <li>I love how this makes my skin look so healthy!</li>
      <li>the love of my life ...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure how I&#x27;m going to do this.</li>
      <li>I love washing my face with this.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you have some ziploc bags</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This piece of soap was much larger than I thought which was a pleasant surprise!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s softer than I thought it&#x27;d be, making it easy to cut.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll admit, when this soap first arrived it kind of scared me.  </li>
      <li>My aging skin (including my face) feels great and not dry like it used to.  </li>
      <li>I like this soap just fine for my face.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin so smooth.  </li>
      <li>After I finished washing my face felt really clean and smooth.  </li>
      <li>it show do git that azz clean.</li>
      <li>Excellent texture for scrubbing skin, no harsh chemicals, long lasting, pleasant not overpowering scent.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice smell to it - it&#x27;s a natural smell, not chemical, but yet not floral.  </li>
      <li>This soap seems to work great, the only real problem I had was with the packaging.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping it would be the magic cure for my adult acne</li>
      <li>The difference being that this soap was very crumbly and lasted for just a very short time.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I am very pleased with everything else about it.  </li>
      <li>Smells fresh and cleans very, very, well.</li>
      <li>so I was able to cut it into smaller chunks so we could share.</li>
      <li>I trashed after the first use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It worked better for acne than the commercial acne washes and you&#x27;re not being exposed to all of the chemicals.  </li>
      <li>The box itself was pretty &amp;#34;soggy&amp;#34; in one of the corners where the soap was.  </li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant but not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>This has to be one of the strangest things that i have bought lately, but one of the best surprises when I actually started using it.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty large piece of soap</li>
      <li>If you need your soap bar to look a certain way, then do buy this.</li>
      <li>It also totally strips your skin - feels squeeky clean but very drying!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>but it really isn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>but on real talk.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sure what happened, if maybe it got hot and melted a little or what</li>
      <li>Healthy soap helps with eczema and other skin issues</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t really love the dark residue it leaves on my white tub, but if it really works than it is worth it.</li>
      <li>Just not from this particular seller.</li>
      <li>Very soothing, and natural!</li>
      <li>Next, it felt very smooth while I was washing my face and did not have a perfumy smell or any other odor to it.  </li>
      <li>All natural!</li>
      <li>Make sure you cut off a small piece to use rather than the whole thing to make it last longer!</li>
      <li>I like that it&#x27;s made with all natural ingredients and no chemicals.</li>
      <li>I have to say I was really surprised by this soap.  </li>
      <li>Started using this on my son&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Had powdery blue green mold growing around the top when I opened the package.</li>
      <li>First of all, it lathered up really well with little effort.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is exactly same as the one we made from high school lab, Sodium hydroxide mix with fat.</li>
      <li>This raw black soap feels so nice on your skin.</li>
      <li>Definitely looks more natural than other black soaps I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I bought this soap for my mom to use because several people told me that Raw African Black Soap was good for psoriasis.  </li>
      <li>It would probably get too soft if exposed to extra moisture.  </li>

<li> Very disappointed since the other reviewers sounded very happy with theirs.</li>
<li> It is really Amazing, although it looks ugly.</li>
<li> but it has helped with dry skin</li>
<li> I notice my face isnt so dry anymore</li>
<li> Product needs to be cut down to smaller sizes.</li>
<li> I have only used half of one piece (I received 2 pieces).  </li>
<li> Very dry after wash with this</li>
<li> I devorced my other store bought soap ...</li>
<li> It lasts a long time and you only need a very small amount.</li>
<li> I think it was very old or just poorly made.</li>
<li> I think it has lasted so well since I apply it to a fluffy nylon brush and keep it outside the shower on a small tray with drainage.  </li>
<li> - there seemed to be some black rubbery substance in it.  </li>
<li> When my face was rinsed I did not feel any left behind film or residue like other face washes can have.  </li>
<li> I was very skeptical on this purchase but it has been money well spent so far!  </li>
<li> but I had some dark age spots on my arms which I can hardly see anymore.</li>
<li> small particles scratching the skin.</li>
<li> was the first time I was disappointed with it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure I will rebuy though...</li>
<li> From this seller the product was extremely hard.</li>
<li> Chop off a piece and keep it hidden so visitors don&#x27;t see it&#x27;s ugliness, but don&#x27;t be afraid to use it.</li>
<li> i was truly weak ....</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll be cutting off pieces to use as needed.</li>
<li> Terrible stuff - not sure what&#x27;s in it</li>
<li> bad as well.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ll admit, when this soap first arrived it kind of scared me.  It doesn&#x27;t look anything like &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; store-bought soap.  It has a nice smell to it - it&#x27;s a natural smell, not chemical, but yet not floral.  My daughter used the soap on her face and her acne cleared up!  It was amazing!  It worked better for acne than the commercial acne washes and you&#x27;re not being exposed to all of the chemicals.  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I have this soap too... i was reading some of these reviews...i was truly weak .... crackin up...but on real talk. This is the best soap i ever used. Where you been all my life soap...lol..the love of my life ...dont eva leave my side. I devorced my other store bought soap ... you may be a ugly soap but baby u work it !!  Keep up tha good work !!  Coz it it show do git that azz clean.</li>
    <li> Healthy soap helps with eczema and other skin issues</li>
    <li> It doesnt look good when it arrived however maybe its good? Havent had enough courage to use it yet. lol</li>
    <li> small particles scratching the skin. otherwise good with room for improvement. can you make it bigger or offer a discount of smaller bar soap with the order?</li>
    <li> This soap is very good for acne it has a healing effect on your skin.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed Do not spend your Money on this item. From this seller the product was extremely hard. Almost like washing with sand paper. I do recommend the product. Just not from this particular seller. I do buy this product on A regular basis.this was the first time I was disappointed with it. I think it was very old or just poorly made.I had to throw it away! Didn&#x27;t bother to send it back.wish I could give it no stars!</li>
    <li> best soap you can buy</li>
    <li> I like this soap just fine for my face. I was hoping it would be the magic cure for my adult acne but it really isn&#x27;t. It does make my skin look nice though. I&#x27;m not sure I will rebuy though...</li>
    <li> Works well in cleaning. I like that it&#x27;s made with all natural ingredients and no chemicals.</li>
    <li> Was kind of iffy about this product but it has helped with dry skin</li>
    <li> Much bigger than I was expecting so I&#x27;ve cut off smaller pieces.  This has helped reduce the inflammation and irritation my daughter and I both experience from eczema and psoriasis.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love it. Great product and price. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I have been using the soap for 2 months.  My aging skin (including my face) feels great and not dry like it used to.  I will keep using it.  I have only used half of one piece (I received 2 pieces).  I think it has lasted so well since I apply it to a fluffy nylon brush and keep it outside the shower on a small tray with drainage.  It would probably get too soft if exposed to extra moisture.  If you need your soap bar to look a certain way, then do buy this.</li>
    <li> Great soap, I cut them in pieces. This should last me for awhile. Very soothing, and natural!</li>
    <li> This is awesome!  I love washing my face with this.  It leaves my skin so smooth.  I cut chunks off and use it that way.  This has to be one of the strangest things that i have bought lately, but one of the best surprises when I actually started using it.</li>
    <li> Good Product and good seller, recommended</li>
    <li> This work awesome and my wife loved it; however, she can&#x27;t use it on her face. It gave her a burning feeling so she uses it everywhere elese.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this soap before from another maker.  The difference being that this soap was very crumbly and lasted for just a very short time.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I am very pleased with everything else about it.  Smells fresh and cleans very, very, well.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical on this purchase but it has been money well spent so far!  This piece of soap was much larger than I thought which was a pleasant surprise!</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I notice my face isnt so dry anymore and I dont know if the product has anything to do with it, but I had some dark age spots on my arms which I can hardly see anymore. Been using for one month. It lasts a long time and you only need a very small amount. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Excellent texture for scrubbing skin, no harsh chemicals, long lasting, pleasant not overpowering scent.  Has helped with my psoriasis.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap for my mom to use because several people told me that Raw African Black Soap was good for psoriasis.  I cut off a chunk for myself to try when I washed my face as well.  I have to say I was really surprised by this soap.  First of all, it lathered up really well with little effort.  Next, it felt very smooth while I was washing my face and did not have a perfumy smell or any other odor to it.  After I finished washing my face felt really clean and smooth.  When my face was rinsed I did not feel any left behind film or residue like other face washes can have.  I will be replacing my regular face wash with this soap.</li>
    <li> Returning. Had powdery blue green mold growing around the top when I opened the package. Very disappointed since the other reviewers sounded very happy with theirs. Off to find something else.</li>
    <li> This soap is great. It&#x27;s softer than I thought it&#x27;d be, making it easy to cut. I like that it&#x27;s unscented.</li>
    <li> This soap is ugly, but works surprisingly well.  Chop off a piece and keep it hidden so visitors don&#x27;t see it&#x27;s ugliness, but don&#x27;t be afraid to use it.</li>
    <li> This soap seems to work great, the only real problem I had was with the packaging.  The box itself was pretty &amp;#34;soggy&amp;#34; in one of the corners where the soap was.

    <li> Terrible stuff - not sure what&#x27;s in it - there seemed to be some black rubbery substance in it.  It also totally strips your skin - feels squeeky clean but very drying!</li>
    <li> Started using this on my son&#x27;s sensitive skin. He was put off by the look of the soap and I don&#x27;t really love the dark residue it leaves on my white tub, but if it really works than it is worth it. The smell is pleasant but not overwhelming. Lathers well. This is a pretty large piece of soap so I was able to cut it into smaller chunks so we could share.</li>
    <li> Much larger than I was expecting! I&#x27;ll be cutting off pieces to use as needed. Definitely looks more natural than other black soaps I&#x27;ve tried. Nice and creamy, feels great.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s good stuff, don&#x27;t get it in your eyes. Make sure you have some ziploc bags cause you&#x27;re gonna wanna cut it up in whatever shape you prefer.</li>
    <li> Product needs to be cut down to smaller sizes. I&#x27;m not quite sure how I&#x27;m going to do this. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
