<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this shaver does work ..somewhat....but you really need to shave first with a blade and eventually if you go over an area enough times it elinates stubble..but it takes forever!..i wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> The razor does not work as expected. I want to try another product. Your hair has to be really short</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing shaver. It leaves your skin feeling completely bare. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Never had an electric shaver work.  It actually gets really close to a regular shave and size makes it convenient to get ot tight curvy corners.  Only complaint is I guess I didn&#x27;t read it was battery operated and was assuming it was rechargeable.  Oh well, so far the 1 C battery has lasted a month..not bad.</li>
    <li> Great for keeping up with the stubble in those intimate areas when used on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver. Only 4 stars for battery. Would have been great if it used AA. Shaves very close to the skin. Skin feels smooth, just like shaving with a razor. But without irritated skin. Hair just needs to be short, so absolutely perfect for everyday maintenance.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sharp enough to cut the coarsest hair and does not catch the skin.  Be sure to use talcum powder.</li>
    <li> Not exactly the close trim that is advertised. And needs some powder lube to keep from grabbing. Just so-so performance.</li>
    <li> After reading many of the reviews I was anxiously looking forward to a shaver that would work well without needing to worry about nicks on personal areas.  I followed the directions (what few there were) and also tips from other reviews.  However, it did virtually nothing on either bikini line or underarm even after 10 minutes of shaving virtually the same tiny area, there would be only a few bits of stubble that would be removed.  Think twice about spending your money on this product. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> shaver does not get as close as I would like.I  have sensitive skin &amp; can use it everywhere without getting red bumps.  It&#x27;s hard to get the hair that lay down. I don&#x27;t think u can do anything about that unless u use a straight razor.   I still use it, but it would be nice if it could get the hairs even closer &amp; feel even smoother</li>
    <li> I received the shaver and was shocked. A $36, battery powered electric razor that did not include a battery. That&#x27;s right- did not include a battery. That type of inattention to detail is appalling. And it was a purchase from Amazon, not one of the affiliates. It will be a very long time before I consider Amazon for my business again.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a close shave then this is not the product you want.  I tried using it a few times and it never worked. It&#x27;s a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to shave sensetive areas mentioned above. After a long research, comparing prices, etc. I found this product to be attractive, small, and after reading most of the good/bad reviews, I decided to buy it. I got it the following day, and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. And guess what? results were amazing; I suffered a lot before having my personal shaving knocking my.... yes, och! Now, with this cool shaving machine, I can have it smooth. I am very satisfied with the results and thought to write this review.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver;  it is my second one.  I wanted a second one for my travel bag.  It is perfect for all ladies special needs.  Never irritates, and leaves smooth skin.  A +++++</li>
    <li> This shaver leaves a very soft, close result. It will not shave more than 2 days growth, so the first time it is used, the area must be shaved with another razor. It is worth the trouble, because later shaves will be pinch and nick free. Lasts about a year with daily use. Uses a \\&quot;c\\&quot; battery.</li>
    <li> I was sick of paying for bikini waxes, so I thought I&#x27;d try this out.  I was disappointed.  I followed the directions to the T and it didn&#x27;t give me the smoothness I was looking for.  I still had stubble.  So, I would pass on this product.  Wish I could get my money back.  : (  Wanted to pass along this information to you in order to save ya&#x27;ll money b/c I wish I would have read a review like this when I was contemplating this purchase.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work,,,,,,,,,,,,would like a refund</li>
    <li> I am a female and I bought this shaver for my bikini and genital area.  I personally think it does a better job on the genital area than on the bikini area.  It really makes a difference at what angles your hair grows, and if your hair is on the smoother side and grows very parallel to your skin (like it does on the areas that would show right around my bikini line), it&#x27;s tough to get it all with this shaver.  It does a good job on the more coarse hair in more intimate areas, as those stand at more of a perpendicular angle (especially when they&#x27;re short and stubbly after having been shaved a few days before).    You will have to pull gently at your skin and/or hold it in a kind of pinched way sometimes to make sure you get all of the hairs at an angle the shaver will reach, but none of that is painful and it does work.  You&#x27;ll also have to go over each area more than once, so plan on devoting a few minutes to the process (more than that for your first time or two), because you won&#x27;t be able to get it all super quickly with the multiple runs over areas and the need to stretch and pull your skin.  I haven&#x27;t really had any experiences of it pinching or nicking my skin.  Do use some sort of baby powder, particularly in damper areas to make the skin dry and easy to run the shaver over.    I use a compressed air can, along with the little cleaning brush that comes with it, to clean it after each use.  I don&#x27;t think the brush does a thorough job on its own.    Overall I&#x27;m quite happy with this product and would recommend it as a worthwhile purchase.  I have to use it pretty much every day to stay truly smooth, and there are a couple tiny areas that I tend to run a razor over (going in the same direction as the hair so it won&#x27;t create razor burn) after using the shaver just because the hair in those places isn&#x27;t at enough of an angle for the shaver to really reach.  You would definitely need to use a trimmer to get the hair to a short stubble before using this shaver; I opted for actually shaving everything with a razor first, and then using the shaver to shave the stubble once it started growing back a day or two later, and have continued doing that stubble maintenance ever since.    The battery life is also pretty good.  I&#x27;ve had the razor for about six months now and have changed the batteries only once so far, probably a couple of months in, while using it every few days.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this looking for a solution for ingrown hairs, and it&#x27;s done the trick.  It&#x27;s technically not as smooth as shaving, but it&#x27;s so close it makes no difference to me. The red bump alternative is no contest at all.    Here&#x27;s the things to know:  1) If you don&#x27;t use it every day, you will have to use a trimmer first. The clean cut really seems to be just for smoothing out light stubble. I found that many times, just the trimmer will do for my needs, and then other times I&#x27;d like that extra bit of smoothness that this gives.    2) It&#x27;s almost as close as shaving, so it follows that you can still get ingrown hairs. But I don&#x27;t get them if I don&#x27;t stretch the skin for that extra bit of closeness. The result looks completely hair free, and feels quite smooth. I&#x27;m satisfied - much much better that dealing with the aftermath of shaving.</li>
    <li> Great product. Highly Recommend !</li>
    <li> At first glance, this shaver appears less than one would hope or expect.  However, put to the test, the ES412 exceeds in performance, easy of use, and satisfaction.      Closeness of Shave:    The product was initially purchased for female use, but has also been used for male areas with excellent results.  The shaver produces a very close, smooth as silk shave on all body areas, when used with or without the supplied powder.  Use of the powder is recommended to prevent ingrown hairs that could result from the very close shave; however, that has have never been a problem for either male or female use.  We have NEVER suffered nicks to body areas with raised hair follicles for both male and female use.  I would attributed this to the fine screen above the cutter head.  (Perhaps the fine screen could be a problem with very coarse hairs, but not experienced by either here.)       Performance / power:  Battery life is very satisfactory with alkaline batteries.  NiHydride batteries work perfectly in the shaver, but with shorter cycle times than alkalines; just as one would expect.      Ease of Use:  Cleaning the shaver is a snap, just unscrew the metal cap and wash.  We use a small brush to adequately clean the cutters and below where hair and powder collect.  Another added benefit of the fine screen is efficient capture allowing very little stubble or powder to leak from the shaver during use.  The cutter head must be made using very hard metal as it has not dulled with use.    Repeat purchase:  I am purchasing a second shaver now, and together we give four thumbs up ;-)  Cheers!!</li>
    <li> I love this shaver if you touch up every day it will keep you very smooth. I have had one for years and the only up keep is replacing batteries and once in awhile a new shaver head. Hightly recommed the women and men to.</li>
    <li> I just received this item and used it for the first time a few days ago - it&#x27;s awesome! The smoothest nether-regions shave you can get. I haven&#x27;t been able to wax (it always leaves me with terrible ingrown hairs, regardless of the aftercare products used), and when I&#x27;ve shaved with a disposable blade shaver, I still end up with stubble because I have to shave with the grain of the hair - shaving in the other direction leaves me with irritated red bumps, even with a fresh blade, oil, shaving cream, etc. The Cleancut left me with completely smooth skin, no red bumps, and no irritation - friggin&#x27; great! Of course, you do have to follow the instructions carefully - lots of talc free powder, and they really mean it when they say your hair has to be short, I mean REALLY short (otherwise the hair will lay flat and won&#x27;t catch in the screen - the trick is to have the hair standing up off your skin, which it tends to do better when very short, and just emerging from the skin). And of course, as with all shaving, you have to do regular maintenance or else you&#x27;ll end up with stubble - totally not the fault of the product, just a hazard of shaving. If you&#x27;re fine with that, and like me, can&#x27;t seem to deal with wax, then this product is for you.</li>
    <li> Hated it! Didn&#x27;t get close shave! If you want a close shave, wax! It knicked me..left a little blood. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> It works better than expected, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase. The size is perfect and great for all areas.</li>
    <li> This personal shaver is very attractive and compact, but it does not cut very well at all.  I do not know how the people who used it and wrote reviews on it could say that it worked great!  Even after cutting my hair very, very low and close to the skin, it still did not do the job in giving me a smooth, shaved area.</li>
    <li> I really recommend buyng this product. It is great for shaving without pain!! First time I see a product like this and it is very effective.</li>
    <li> I used this product in the EXACT way that other reviews have described as the &amp;#34;proper way.&amp;#34; I read every instruction. I used baby powder. I cleaned off any lotions... It did not shave one hair on me. I have had personal shavers in the past that cost $10 that worked 20x better than this one did. Do not buy this product unless you have used it before and had success. Seeing that it was $50 made me think that it was probably a good shaver, but it&#x27;s just an overpriced, poorly made product. I am not a picky person whatsoever, and leaving a bad review is out of my character; however, I am telling you, do not buy this! You can get a better product for less.</li>
    <li> I like this shaver especially because it&#x27;s such a nice shape to hold, and makes a quiet whirring noise I find pleasing.  My regular electric shaver feels like a loud beast compared to this.  In terms of quality of shave, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s similar to my regular electric shaver.  But the small head size makes it easier to use in the nooks and crannies.  I think if you&#x27;re trying to go bare, it&#x27;s a certain amount of work no matter what device you use.  Sometimes you really have to repeatedly go over an area and stretch the skin in a way to make the hair stick out so the shaver grabs it.  Overall I think this is a very well designed device.</li>
    <li> Have had mine 7 yrs and it works great. You MUST keep it clean, oil it periodically, it makes a huge difference. I&#x27;ve had to adjust the blades, a simple process. Having to replace the foil and blades should be expected but mine last two years at least, sometimes longer. The foil is delicate, it has to be so keep the protective cover on, and better yet also in the bag. I didn&#x27;t and knocked mine over denting the foil, MY fault!   I found sometimes the shaver glides over hair a bit too much with the powder, but try this method. Apply quite a bit of the powder just before bed rubbing it in good. The shave seems easier and better the next day,and more consistent that way,at least for me. When used properly the skin is smooth as silk. Theres some areas that are simply too stubborn to get perfect, but after you get used to it you will know which areas need to be shaved using different yet easy methods. Some places the skin needs to be gently pinched to raise the hairs, some areas that doesn&#x27;t work as well. Time and getting used to it will solve that. I tried the more expensive rechargeable model, and another brand thats rechargeable and spends most of it&#x27;s advertising dollar saying how much better it is than this shaver, wrong! Used properly, kept CLEAN and finding what works best for you will give you the best and smoothest shave you can get!</li>
    <li> ok ok after all the bad reviews i HAVE to say something, this IS the best it gets as other than a razor blade scraping your skin, its only job is maintaining a shaved  condition not creating it,as far as what its intended to to it does it better than anything else out there period! sure it seems somewhat cheap in appearance but once you figure out what is about nothing else comes close. zero razor burn,zero bumps or rash, and it will indeed cut close as a regular razor if you  take the time to do so..i found the trick is feeling with opposite hand the stubble and trail behind fingers with this, its sooo cool you can HEAR when it is getting something and adjust to do its best,baby smooth if you take the time to figure it out and use it properly,powder does help but dry does just as well because if you angle edge of shaver towards skin it pulls skin tight for you, i LOVE that baby smooth feeling and this will deliver it, if used properly and some patience from the user this will deliver baby smooth skin without the rash, bumps, and ingrown hairs that normally comes from shaving, i give it 100% satifaction rating to those dissing it learn to use it before you slam it ;-)  Adam</li>
    <li> After reading the instructions several times and using it a few, I would NOT buy this product. It does nothing but make noise. Cuts nothing, does not matter the length of hair. I have tried everthing. With powder, without powder, does not matter. Try another brand!!!</li>
    <li> This was the biggest waste of money. I have bought several items online and have had my issues with a couple, but this is the worst by far. Usually if I have problems with online purchases it will break easily or won&#x27;t work in some way, but it will work. This item is a glorified vibrator. The person I purchased this for was very disappointed and wished I would spent my money on something else. This should be removed from amazon as an item to purchase, it is just piece of junk. They are stealing people&#x27;s money. All it does is vibrate and does not do the job on any part of the body let alone the part it is meant for.</li>
    <li> Very, very good for those really difficult and, um, &#x27;personal&#x27;, areas to get to. I use the Cleancut PS335 T-Shape Personal Shaver first, to trim down hairs, then this Cleancut ES412 Personal Shaver for a close, smooth shave. Use a corn starch based powder (lightly) to avoid chafing.</li>
    <li> After reading about this shaver elsewhere online and scanning the product reviews here, I decided to take a chance. I heard that this product would produce a clean, smooth shave, easily. What a total crock. I read the instructions and followed them to a T, but this shaver didn&#x27;t do a darn thing! As other reviewers stated, the device makes a lot of noise as if it&#x27;s shaving, but the hair goes nowhere. I tried with long hairs, medium hairs, closely cropped stubble, and this thing shaved NONE OF IT. Over and over, no matter how long I tried, I couldn&#x27;t get the clean shave people talked about. I was lucky to even have the shaver cut any hair at all! All that time spent for nothing - I could have just shaved with a razor and gotten smooth results! Anyway, long story short, this thing is a total waste of money. Please, please, please save your cash.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all...full refund was given.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> your hairs lay down on your skin even when cut short.  This shaver needs hairs to not only be short, but to stand straight up.  My hairs lye flat against my skin, no matter what length.</li>
    <li> Not really seeing a difference between this purchase or the cheap wet/dry one I purchased at walmart.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> I wanted a really close shave for those certain areas, but this just didn&#x27;t quite do it for me. Did it get close? Yes. Very close. However, the hair had to be extremely short already. So it was a normal shave, then another shave with this. Tedious and time consuming. I even tried lectric shave, but it had little effect. So, I would not recommend this product unless you are super worried about a close shave and have spare time on your hands.  The product seems to be built with quality but it is quite slippery. My friend dropped it once and it broke. Its an electric device, so I cannot expect it to last through a four foot fall onto a linoleum floor, but just a heads up for those of you who tend to be rough on your electronics.</li>
    <li> It is ok but not as good as I thought it would be having read the write up of it.</li>
    <li> My cleancut just up and died after seven years of constant use. What a great little shaver! I&#x27;m getting a new one today.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this shaver.  I just threw it away because I became tired of fighting with it every time I tried to use it.  It worked great right up until I unscrewed the screen to clean it.  After that the screen pushed in on itself with even the slightest pressure.  What a pain!  The only reason I haven&#x27;t thrown it away sooner is that I shoved it in the bathroom cupboard and went back to using a disposable razor.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly as advertised!!! No ingrown hairs or pain.  You do have to go over some areas a couple of times to hit the hair at the correct angle.  But nonetheless a perfect shave...Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It is by far the best personal shaver out there. Just make sure that you trim off the bulk first then use this.</li>
    <li> I personally liked it for the shave it gives.</li>
    <li> I buy a lot of items via Amazon and this was by far the most disappointing.  I was initially very excited to receive this item because of the positive reviews.  I&#x27;ve tried using this shaver on almost every hair length, but unfortunately, this item does not work as I had expected.  I ended up buying another shaver for $8.99 at my local grocery store that works fantastic.  I would love to return this item for a refund, but fear it has been too long since purchase.  Overall, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the best shaver I have ever owned. I no longer have nicks, cuts, or itchy red bumps. It is very important that you read the instructions and use it appropriately to get the best results. The hair does have to be very short already to use it, but it cuts as close as a straight edge razor and is easy to manage if you use it every other day. I do recommend getting a trimmer to go along with it - some of the kits have both together, but the &#x27;as seen on tv&#x27; trimmer works just as well. I am more than satisfied with this shaver. It is AMAZING!! And, my husband completely approves. :)</li>
    <li> This is the second Cleancut personal shaver that I&#x27;ve purchased.  I had my first one for about 4 years and when the top part broke I just had to replace it.  It truly gives a close shave and leaves no stubble...nice and smooth when done.  I was going to just buy a new replacement head but listened to the reviews and opted to purchase a new shaver instead.  Glad I did.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in a safe, close shave.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST if you want the closest cleanest cut shave possible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using one of these for more then five years; and I love it. I&#x27;m still using the original razor; I&#x27;ve only replaced the blade twice in all that time. And I use this thing nearly everyday.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found it to be absolutely safe to use anywhere in the male public region; no cuts, nicks, or burns. I&#x27;ve never had any trouble with ingrown hairs either.&lt;br /&gt;The razor is meant to be used on short hairs. So you can use it on your face for a two or three day growth (my beard comes in fast); that would be a good guide line for the maximum length hair you should go after. So for pube&#x27;s or underarms you need another trimmer to shorten up the hair for that first use. After that you can maintain a smooth surface with this little gem.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good size and shape, easy to hold. It&#x27;s tough as well; I&#x27;ve dropped it a couple times over the years; and it just keeps going.&lt;br /&gt;It works on hairs on the outside surface of your ears too; around the nares of the nose; any place the razors head can reach.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why sone people are having so many problems; but I&#x27;m guessing they&#x27;re going after hair that&#x27;s to long.&lt;br /&gt;So just make sure you have a small standard trimmer for that first use; and you&#x27;ll almost certainly be satisfied. So with your significant other.&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t forget to clean your razor. It needs to emptied after about two trims. It&#x27;s not hard. Just take the head off and dump the trimmings. Then wipe down the blade with a tissue to get the residual trimmings that stick to the blade. Your razor with perform better if you keep it clean.</li>
    <li> I was nervous about getting this shaver because of all the one star reviews, but depending on what I am shaving, it either works well or doesn&#x27;t work at all.    I have very fine, fair hair on my arms...I did not cut it, so perhaps it was too long, but it was not cut with this shaver.   I have very fine, very short peach fuzz on my face that I can see when light is shined on it.  This shaver got it all.   I did a test run on my bikini area and on the areas that were prepped properly (that is preshaven) it gave me a baby smooth cut.    I think that in order for this to work well, you need to follow the directions to the letter--if you don&#x27;t, it won&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this thing but it didn&#x27;t even work for me at all! I tried it on different areas of my body that had different hair lengths and this thing doesn&#x27;t even shave it off. Trust me when I tell you, this thing is useless. Save your money and DONT buy it.</li>
    <li> The progressive numbness in my hands make it impossible to use a razor without putting too much pressure on my face and nicking myself.  This shaver works for me...as I realized there was a covering on the top of the unit....LOL</li>
    <li> Great product. No irritation and a very close shave without any pain. Both my wife and I use it. Recommend without reservations to manscape.</li>
    <li> Kind of reminds me of a clothing shaver...You know the ones that clip all the little pills you get on some sweaters, shirts or pants...  If you have thick whiskers or hair follicles, they do not get cut! Overall, your best bet is to get a quality Norelco (or of the like) electric shaver.  For me, it was not worth the price and not worth the time to try and return it.</li>
    <li> I bought the razor after reading the reviews...this is the best razor I have ever purchased, love the size and shape, very sturdy, cutting blades very sharp, cleans easy, very very close shave, is great for the bikini line area, great for underarms and my husband has used it to shave his face...great smooth shave...trick is make sure your not trying to cut off a weeks worth of growth, shave with regular razor to get rid of that growth, then use the Cleancut ES412 from then on...unreal smooth shave, no pulling or nicking, to clean just unscrew top and I just blow out what may be in it...you have to try it, I assure you, you will love it, I&#x27;m even ordering another to take with me on trips. I will never purchase another type of razor. You must try it you will not be disapointed.. Thanks Cleancut for being so honest and producing such a great razor, its even more then you say it is....Thanks again...</li>
    <li> When I received the product I was very happy with how it looked. It seemed really compact and had a nice heft to it so did not feel flimsy.  I used a bikini trimmer to get the hair down really low, and then used the product with lots of powder to try to get a nice clean smooth cut -- going for a completely clean look, all off.  I can say that it felt really nice on my skin, very smooth, no pulling or yanking on the hair, no pinching or anything like that.  But it didnt get everything off no matter how many times i went over the area or what direction i went in-- up, down, left, right, circular, nothing.  I still had very very short stubble in most areas, and some of the hairs werent even affected at all, some were still the same length they were before I started.  It is a nice little shaver, and may work for other people with less coarse hair, dont know, but it didnt work as well as i had hoped and i had to end up using a regular razor to get that really clean bikini line which gave me horrible bumps and itched like crazy.  Not fun.  I should say though that the cleancut did not give me any bumps (I used the razor quite a few days later and there were no bumps before I used it, so I can say the shaver did leave me bump and itch free. Overall, a nice shaver but didnt work 100% for me.</li>
    <li> I bought my Seiko ES412 8 years ago for twice the price as Amazon. Its been the best shaver for my intimate areas. I consistently get a smooth shave with no irritation, nicks or ingrown hairs. My other half bought a similar shaver that died a year later which was really the waste of money. I&#x27;ve never had to replace any parts other than a fresh battery. It does take a little practice to find the best technique that works for your body, you must use a trimmer to reduce the hair to stubble and you need to hit the area at different angles to effectively shave off all of the hairs and always be sure to use powder. This razor is a quality item that over the years has been worth every penny I paid.</li>
    <li> Finally a good close shave without razor burn!  for years ive been trying different remedies and tactics to prevent bumps and irritation, to no avail. this is the best $30 i have ever spent. i used johnsons baby powder and it worked perfectly. i will follow the advice of the other poster who uses a can of compressed air to clean it, as i agree the brush didnt get it completely clean. thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> You never know when you order something online.  It could be complete junk or it could actually be a decent product.  This is one of the few items I&#x27;ve ordered online that really works well.  Not only is it great for the bikini line, but I often use it for touch-ups on my legs after shaving.  I&#x27;m assuming it could even be a nice travel size for a man&#x27;s (rotary) shaver?  I&#x27;ve been using it for a good month now and the batteries haven&#x27;t even begun to wear down as far as I can tell.  It&#x27;s easy to clean.  It&#x27;s well made too - metal instead of plastic and it just has that &#x27;weight&#x27; that makes it feel sturdy and long lasting.  I give this product a whopping 10 of 10 thumbs-up!  Go ahead and buy it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this brand to save about $15 compared to another brand listed.  I&#x27;ve returned this item and exchanged for the more expensive unit.</li>
    <li> Better than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.  Fits hand with ease.  NEVER CUTS OR NICKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found it easier to do a pre-cut with a regular electric hair shaver and then using this at the end to get all of the hair off.  It works best with very short hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up &amp; down motion can sometimes be better.  Other times, side to side motion will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping the battery fresh and maximum is essential.  Change them often (takes a &#x27;C&#x27;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made In Japan quality.</li>
    <li> If you are someone who likes to go smooth \\&quot;down south\\&quot; this is the shaver for you.It works like a charm when you begin with stubble that is pretty short- like 1 or 2 days of growth. I use my regular razor to take it down to the skin and the cleancut will keep it there as long as I use it every day or two. It leaves my skin totally smooth and not irritated. I follow up Min New York Solutions2 as an aftershaving treatment... I have dark hair that is pretty heavy and this product works for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m modifying my review.     I&#x27;ve used it about 10 times now, and this item is even worse than I thought. I know I&#x27;m doing it exactly right, but leaves a very noticeable stubble.     Perhaps it&#x27;s a quality control problem, with some getting a better unit. Or maybe the people who like it are happy with something other than a smooth shave.     This item is basically unreturnable, by the time you pay shipping and the sanitary disposal fee.     I basically gave this company a gift of my money.     COMPLETELY USELESS.</li>
    <li> This shaver works good when used in tandem with the trimmer. It has been used on my chest and my wifes armpits and genital areas. While not leaving a perfectly smooth shave like a razor, it is well within acceptable limits and there have been no problems with irritation or bumps. Highly recommend using the baby powder or talcum powder or whatever. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it coming unscrewed like some of the other reviews but we do double check and make sure its tight before each use.</li>
    <li> Overall I am satisfied with this product. The best way to use this is shave the area with normal /gel completely One time. Afterwards use this product daily or alternatively depends upon your growth. Veru safe and happy</li>
    <li> I have been looking at this for a very very long time. I finally pulled the trigger on it. If you men out there like to trim IT up this handy tool is a must!</li>
    <li> Some of my friends love this thing, however it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I have thick hair that grows fast.  To use this I&#x27;d have to do it daily and it takes 10 minutes just to get my bikini line mostly clean. If you have thick hair, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> Got this hoping to use it for daily up-keep of my bikini line, but sadly it didn&#x27;t work for that purpose. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the shaver&#x27;s fault. It seems very well constructed, all metal maybe even steel, and the blades are very sharp and well made. It&#x27;s easy to clean, too. I still use it to remove the fine hair on my upper lip and it works GREAT for that! I just swipe it across my upper lip every 4 or 5 days it takes MAYBE 15 seconds and I&#x27;m left with no &amp;#34;moustache&amp;#34; whatsoever and without messy, smelly, burn-y creams. Can&#x27;t hardly beat that!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe the negative reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t using it properly and for the very specific purpose that it was designed for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This GREAT shaver was created to use within very limited and specific parameters. If you try to use it for anything else, or in any other way, it will not meet your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CleanCut was designed for that most intimate and private area, on both men and women. It&#x27;s quite a challenge to work in such a sensitive area, with so many folds and potential snags. But the authentic (more on that later) Japanese made CleanCut by Seiko does a very admirable job with few nicks or grabs, IF you use it right. And here&#x27;s how to do that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Start with clean dry skin. You must initially reduce the hair length down to a short stubble. You can do that in several ways such as using that straight razor one last time, or buy the companion shaver that was made just for this purpose, the [[ASIN:B00141DEAC Cleancut PS335 T-Shape Personal Shaver]]. The PS335 was developed after the ES412 just for the purpose of getting the hair down to the right length for the ES412 to work easily. Do be aware that the PS335 has a much more exposed blade and will nick you if you try to go too fast. See my review there. One of the key words with both of these shavers is Take Your Time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Once the hair is short enough, you MUST dust the whole area with powder. This is NOT an option. The recommended powder for this shaver is [[ASIN:B001MU8PT0 Sween Body Powder (formerly Fordustin® Body Powder) With Noncaking, Natural Corn Starch]]. Do NOT use talc! Cover the area completely to lubricate the shaver blades and you&#x27;ll have few nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Because this shaver rarely grabs your skin, I have found that if you bunch the skin up rather than stretch it smooth, you&#x27;ll hit a lot more of the hairs that lay down. You&#x27;re not going to get all of them. Even a straight razor misses hairs so there is some work to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) The shaver will get you pretty smooth, but you&#x27;ll never get as smooth as with a straight blade. Sorry but it just isn&#x27;t possible with any electric shaver because of the design. But at least with this shaver, you probably won&#x27;t see too many razor bumps or ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Shave once or twice a day, removing the longer \\&quot;get away\\&quot; hairs with the PS335 when you find them. If you wait too many days, then you will have to start over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you follow those instructions, you&#x27;ll have a pretty decent experience with this shaver. Don&#x27;t try to use it on your face. It doesn&#x27;t work well there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And be sure to get the authentic Japanese, made by Seiko, CleanCut. There are Chinese fakes out there that are terrible, will break on you easily, and will grab your skin. Be forewarned and check when you get yours to see if it is the real thing. I&#x27;ve had mine now for four years, use it every day and it works exactly to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving!et as smooth as with a straight blade. Sorry but it just isn&#x27;t possible with any electric shaver because of the design. But at least with this shaver, you probably won&#x27;t see too many razor bumps or ingrown hairs.    5) Shave once or twice a day, removing the longer \\&quot;get away\\&quot; hairs with the PS335 when you find them.

    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it to work,&lt;br /&gt;it would not remove any hair&lt;br /&gt;at all, i tried many times,&lt;br /&gt;and followed the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be a great travel item for spring breaks or summer road trips.....no! It doesn&#x27;t do anything, just moves hair around.</li>
    <li> This little shaver works REALLY well.  I never had a problem with it until I dropped it.  That killed it.  Too bad it didn&#x27;t last longer.  I really did enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Very good buy!  I have purchased two and love the way they shave.  I would highly recommend buying one.</li>
    <li> It really doesn&#x27;t work well at all on anything more than a stubble.  I suppose if used more frequently, you could make better use of it.</li>
    <li> Awesome this is great to own.</li>
    <li> I wish I was able to return this product (the amount of time amazon allows to &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; it really is not long enough).  I have followed other comment suggestions and product instructions and all I can say is this is a waste of money.  Does not provide a clean shave, misses a great deal of bikini area hair.  Its a struggle to use and clean (the top is difficult to remove and the metal is poor quality and rouhg to the touch making just unscrewing the cap painful).  Overall it was the quality of something you&#x27;d expect to find at a dollar store.</li>
    <li> Pretty good shaver, over all. It does not give a really close shave, but its electric so you have to expect that to a point. I&#x27;ve used it for those times I needed a quick touch up on my shave. I&#x27;ve also used it in between regular shaves just to keep everything under control. Using some type of powder is advisable I&#x27;ve found, tends to get a closer shave when you use it. Make sure to clean it every time! The battery life doesn&#x27;t last all that long, and it takes c batteries. Over all I&#x27;m pretty well pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver that gives a nice clean shave.  You do have to use powder or else it will not glide over skin and will nick your skin.  It will also not shave longer hairs so I use it everyday to give the best shave possible.  I think it is a good purchase and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  This little thing is great for the lady parts.  Really contours to your body.  It did not come with a battery so be prepared to purchase C batteries.</li>
    <li> I researched this product a lot and found great reviews so decided to buy it. I recieved it in the mail today, followed the instructions religiously and decided to give it a shot. it was absolutely aweful. I would GLADLY shave instead of use this. the product description by other people said it was so amazing and yet it left me in pain, there were bright red blotches on my skin and I did not recieve one smooth spot at all. With no explanation as to why this happened, I am extremely dissapointed with this purchase and I&#x27;m returning it, COMPLETE waste of money, don&#x27;t bother buying it. I am jealous of all the people who got great results from it, it sucked for me. and NO I do not have an allergy to the metal or anything that&#x27;s what somebody asked me. I should give it no stars but I gave it one just for kicks considering its a well made gadget but it doesnt do the job whatsoever. my razor will do fine and I will never complain about shaving again!</li>
    <li> This shaver doesn&#x27;t get as close as I expected and I had to go over a given area numerous times.  It really isn&#x27;t worth the money - my Braun facial shaver works better.  Also, the battery wears out very quickly.</li>
    <li> While this product is made well and functions correctly, it simply does not provide a very close shave without a lot of really unneeded manipulation of the skin. My skin lies flat and this simply will not get it all.    I highly recommend the Cleancut PS335 Femini instead. It is made by the same company and is labeled a trimmer, but I found it work better if you only shave or trim every few days or once a week. Try it first and then if your not happy with what you get you can try this. Remember if you do use the Femini trimmer instead to go SLOWLY.    Just remember to use talc powder with this guy and that you will need to mold and bend the skin for it to get close.</li>
    <li> Best personal shaver! Great price! My girlfriend and I have used it for a couple of years now and it still works like brand new!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much to say about this product except for the fact that it is completely inefficient. I got this product about a month ago. It was simple enough until i decided to putt it to use. This thing was not made for any type of hair. Personally my little area is a bit curly so i had a hard time with the \\&quot;Clean Cut\\&quot;.It got to the point where i decided to go get a bikini wax instead. At first i gave this product the benefit of the doubt, thinking that next time it will be better. I was wrong! A week later i use it again this time i was just trying to do a little touch up on my bikini area, trying to do away with the little hair that was growing back. This thing wouldn&#x27;t even work on that! Nothing i did worked. Honestly the only thing that this so called \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; has cut for me is 30 bucks and 3 cents from my wallet and the hair that i might have missed on my under arms after using a regular razor, and even then i wouldn&#x27;t be too sure it actually cut anything. My advice is unless your hair down there is smoother than the hair on a new born baby&#x27;s head then don&#x27;t waist your money on this \\&quot;shaver\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this item. Does not shave clean- leaves spots. Wish I hadn&#x27;t waisted the money and bought a better brand.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> This little guy was great! It was really easy to shave everywhere and it got pretty close too. But after 3 days of use, it have out. It looks to be very cheaply made. If they made another model that cost more and was built with better materials I would have gotten it. But since they didn&#x27;t, I&#x27;m returning it and going with another brand.</li>
    <li> I researched lots of shavers before choosing this one to create a Brazilian shave.  I used my hubby&#x27;s beard trimmer to get down to stubble, then trimmed with the cleancut.  The shaver worked amazingly well on the most intimate areas, and the most tender skin.  Perfectly baby smooth, just as advertised.  However, I had a really hard time getting the longer, flat-laying hair - around the edges of the bikini line.  In fact, this trimmer never did get those hairs, no matter how many times I went over them, how fast/slow or straight/circles.  I used with and without the powder, and it didn&#x27;t make any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is very quiet, small, with absolutely no pulling, tugging, pinching or cutting.  I was confident using it in every intimate area, and it performed well there.  But, because it couldn&#x27;t handle all my hair (plus it&#x27;s too small/not designed to be used on softer hair like arms/legs) I returned it.  I bought a [[ASIN:B000G0GW6K Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver with Bikini Attachment, Mauve]] and this one does it all.  Not baby smooth, but the pop up trimmer gets all those stray hairs, and it does a fine job with the intimate places.  Ideally, you could get both of these for an absolutely perfect shave, but if you&#x27;re only getting one, I prefer the Panasonic.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend got this to shave her body, and I picked it up one morning to try it on my face after using my standard razor blade to shave my facial hair.  I have a huge mole above my lip like Cindy Crawford, and it is a pain to shave that area clean.  This does a great finishing job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars for shaving body hair, my girlfriend says this is the best ever, and for the first time in years I had to go buy C batteries, which is cool, why, I can&#x27;t say, it just is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil on the shaver seems thinner than on standard facial electric shavers, like models from Braun, and so on.  Great for daily shaving of any face and body hair.  I might just get one for my face, it&#x27;s cheaper and I feel it cuts better than shavers designed just for the face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, as for shaving the sensitive areas below the waist?  If you like to do things like make hearts or other fancy designs with your public hairs (trying to be polite here by saying &#x27;public&#x27;) You can maintain it daily with this shaver.  It won&#x27;t cut the longer, curly hair, it&#x27;ll just ignore it.  So if your design has the curly hair, you can run this shaver right over the whole area, it&#x27;ll keep things nice and neat.  However, if you&#x27;ve cut the hair of the design rather short, where there&#x27;s no curls, this shaver might cut into the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A miracle shaver for men and women, recommended!</li>
    <li> Works great if you use a TWO STEP PROCESS (on face too - thought 4 star for that as a bit more challenging).  I bought mine about five years ago from an online vendor that sold products exclusively for personal area shaving.  Since this area was their specialty, they provided more info and a small canister of Fordustin (now Sween) Body Powder - it&#x27;s CORNSTARCH NON-CAKING powder (only 5 ingredients including silica which makes shaving painless and results in a smooth (as a baby&#x27;s B) feel IF you use this shaver as the second product.  I have only found Fordustin online - prices vary widely so do research.  One 8 oz canister lasts years; smaller good for travel.      I have found that the hair has to be very short (1/16\\&quot; or less) for this shaver to work effectively.  So the first step is to TRIM longer hair.  I use the Seiko-S-Yard-PS334-Femini-Personal shaver (not the T shape).  It works on longer hair - up to a point (1/8\\&quot; is best - if you go longer that&#x27;s where you get pulling).  Also, to keep the blade in optimal condition, occasional oil lubrication is recommended (mine came with it but not sure included anymore).  So for those of you who have wrote this product off, take 5 minutes and do a little Google research on more specialized sites for tips. Also keep in mind that skin texture varies \\&quot;down there\\&quot; :)  Closer \\&quot;in\\&quot; you go, the more delicate...there is no product thats going to give 100% satisfaction without an occasional pull (I&#x27;ll take this over waxing any time).</li>
    <li> This shaver works like a charm on your sensitive skin, leaving it unbelievably soft. It helps to press it into your skin and move it around in circles. Make sure you use either razors or the PS335 to cut your hair to stubble length first, as this shaver cannot remove anything other than extremely short hair. It is physically impossible for this device to cut you, as the blades never directly touch your skin and are placed behind a fine metal mesh. For best results, make sure you use it every day or two, as if you let your hair grow too long, you will have to use the more painful PS335 to cut your hair down to a manageable length before using the ES412.</li>
    <li> I got this for around $30 so completely worth it. I see it&#x27;s now above $40? Sorry, folks.  I&#x27;m happy with it. It&#x27;s best to trim as much as possible first because it only wants to cut a little at a time since only so much hair can get through per spin of the razors, truly ideal for keeping stubble away or at least low. Coarser/Thicker hair is more stubborn. It only wants to shave hairs that are sticking straight up and doesn&#x27;t want to cut hairs that are laid flat or sideways, but I would just pinch the skin to point the hairs upwards so that they would poke into the holes and thus the razors would get them--bahah. I know you&#x27;re supposed to stretch the skin taut, but it never nicked me, which makes me pretty excited for keeping sensitive areas bare and away from scary razors. Do clean after each use even if that can be boring.  It gets one half less of a star from me for not being more awesome and requiring C batteries. I&#x27;d prefer a product that uses AAA, AA or recharge as those are more common, but C batteries are pretty cheap on amazon considering how long this shaver should last you.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver hoping it would solve issues I have with irritation and ugly red bumps which result from frequent shaving of my bikini area during the summer months. My sensitive skin seems to vigorously protest most hair removal solutions I try to use frequently enough to allow for daily bathing suit wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;ve only had this shaver for a few weeks and therefore cannot speak to it&#x27;s potential longevity, it definitely has met my needs and I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, it is pretty worthless at cutting hair which is laying flat against the skin - seemingly problematic for my purposes. However, I&#x27;ve found that if I use it daily, it works great! You have to go slowly, but there is no pain, the size/shape is ideal for this area and - if you&#x27;re starting with short stubble only - it does a great job without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s probably possible to get a CLOSER shave with a non-electric razor. But this shaver provides a close shave and - without the rash/bumps - I think it results in a cleaner appearance than I was able to achieve with a wet razor in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
    <li> Razor isn&#x27;t as good as expected. Definately no comparison to waxing. Definately leaves stubble and undesired hairs. It is a good size and good for I guess in between maintanance. Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> It is true that this shaver will give you a nice smooth feel and appearance.  It is also true that you may get razor burn (perhaps that&#x27;s just user error on my part, but it did happen).  However, I used this shaver twice (and had to do some twisting and turning to get it to work in the first place), and then it just gave out.  I tried a new battery, but to no avail.  The switch just doesn&#x27;t work anymore, which is really irritating given how much the thing costs.</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a personal groomer for my bikini area. I bought this product after reading relatively good reviews. It was terrible. I followed the directions, pulled the skin tight around the area I wanted to shave, used baby powder and it didn&#x27;t come close to a smooth shave. It looked more like week-old stubble. Boo!! I guess I&#x27;ll have to try another brand.</li>
    <li> I bought this little gem about a year or so, but only recently started using it- EVERY DAY! LOVIN&#x27; IT!! I will NEVER use a razor down there again- EVER!&lt;br /&gt; Yes, the hair has to about a quarter of an inch or so, aka \\&quot;5 O&#x27;clock shadow length\\&quot;. I touch up everyday, so I never have to worry about the length. This razor not only gets you shaved down as close as a razor would, but it&#x27;s super easy to clean with the little, mini, brush included with it. You can actually HEAR it shaving the hairs down, so you know it&#x27;s getting EVERYTHING. I never use the powder, but when I&#x27;m done shaving with it I hit the areas shaved with astringent to keep the bumps away. I prefer to use Kiehl&#x27;s Blue Herbal astringent, but anything with alcohol will do. I have recommended this personal shaver to all my friends and even some strangers! This is a must for anyone who enjoys staying shaved bare but HATES dealing with nicks, ingrown&#x27;s, and razor stubble. The ONLY things I would change about it is it&#x27;s ability (or inability) to get the hairs once they get past a certain length. I guess that&#x27;s where the trimmer comes into play. I&#x27;d rather have an all in one. A small complaint for such a high performance little machine.&lt;br /&gt;Get it, SERIOUSLY, you WON&#x27;T be sorry!</li>
    <li> This is the only shaver I have used for the last 10 plus years.  This is my third one (the first two were droped and did not work well after).  The first time you use it, you must have a very light ( small  1/8\\&quot; stubble). Apply baby powder to the area you are going to shave (NEVER SHAVE DRY). You should use slow circular motions, pull the skin to make it tight then shave the area.  You should now have an area that is as smooth as a babys butt.  This Unit is the one used by most Porn Stars who do not Wax.  You should shave everyday or at least every other day to keep clean.  It takes me less than 10 minutes everyday to shave my junk.  Wishing you smooth skin :-)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Not as close of a shave as I thought.</li>
    <li> Works great for bikini and eyebrows.  But hair really does need to be 1/4&amp;#34; or less!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t remember how much I paid for this thing, but I sure hope it wasn&#x27;t $50! What a rip!  It barely made contact with any of the hair, and the hair it did make contact with got snagged (ouch!).  Now I use this: http://www.amazon.com/Schick-Quattro-Trimstyle-Bikini-Trimmer/dp/B001TH8Q72/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1340675063&amp;sr&#x3D;8-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;Gillette+Bikini+Trimmer  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> The Cleancut personal shaver is a great little groomer. The best thing is the hair doesn&#x27;t itch when it grows back. Some reviews complain about it not cutting longer hair, but the product specifically states you need a different razor to cut the hair short. I used the Cleancut ps 335t fir this job. Together they work fantastic.</li>
    <li> While the Cleancut does shave without causing bumps or razor burn, I&#x27;m not completely satisfied with it. Even with one-day worth of growth after shaving \\&quot;down there\\&quot;, the Cleancut takes way too long to shave a small area, and does so imperfectly. It rarely makes any area feel completely smooth-- and doesn&#x27;t even shave other areas. Basically, it takes forever, and leaves me feeling scratchy and looking like I haven&#x27;t shaved in a couple of days. Maybe it works better for others-- but if your hair naturally lies flat, even a day after shaving-- then this is not for you. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> gimik!! worthless makes tons of noise but doesn&#x27;t cut worth a crap!! don&#x27;t buy, get a real shaver or electric razor!!</li>
    <li> This did not do what I was hoping it would. I am not sure if there is a shaver that can get things &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; perfectly smooth and also able to get to all the hairs in every the nook and cranny. Even for just a small clean-up job between shaves was for too much effort for little results. A razor in the shower works much better.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much ! ! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I have used the Cleancut since 2010. Initially I had the Body Bare, a knockoff of the Cleancut, but it was a terrible product (you can see my review of it.) Yeah, it shaved well, but everything else about it was always falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cleancut was a huge improvement! It has been great since day 1. It shaves closely, better than the Body Bare, and it shaves faster. It is also slimmer, so it is easier to maneuver. I am just thrilled with how this thing works. It is sturdy, I have had no problems at all- nothing broken, ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a personal shaver, the Cleancut is the way to go.</li>
    <li> This product is ok for stubble but is not good for removing any hair longer than that. The design makes it safe and easy to use but only in limited areas. Would probably look at another product.</li>
    <li> I researched personal shavers and read up on anything that seemed relevant.  It seemed like this was the model to own. The common theme was that it worked excellent as long as you started with some stubble and used lots of babypowder/talc during the process.  I should state that I am not a particularly hairy person so it&#x27;s not as if I needed anything with \\&quot;turbo shaving\\&quot; abilities.  That being said, it works \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.  Not nearly as well as I hoped but not as bad as I feared either. On the stubble that is readily accessed, no curves, no angles, it works pretty well assuming there is talc and that I go in a few directions - circles, with the grain, against the grain.  For reasons I can&#x27;t figure out, there is some stubble that I just can&#x27;t get no matter what technique!  The areas it does trim, it does an excellent job - very smooth and pain free and my skin hasn&#x27;t been irritated afterwards. It&#x27;s just those more awkward curves that it really can&#x27;t seem to get to.  I&#x27;ve only had it a couple of weeks so I&#x27;m still learning what works.  I think I&#x27;ll have to give up my quest for a completely naked nether region but I may be happy to opt for a nicely coiffed region.</li>
    <li> It works great even for the hairs that lay down. Very gentle on the skin. No bumps. Goodbye razor!</li>
    <li> Not a very close shave. Very comfortable to use on nether regions. I am pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This shaver doesn&#x27;t come with a battery, just wish I knew it didnt come with batteries as I would have ordered one. I have had to order the batteries separately as they are not AA+.</li>
    <li> This works really well, but you have to keep up. It will only cut the shortest of hairs so it doesn&#x27;t allow for any slacking</li>
    <li> First cut long hair with cliper and for short hair you use clean cut shaver . It remove deadskin too. It gives smoothfealing after useing these.</li>
    <li> You definitely have to trim your hair down pretty close but once you get it to a stubble (I used the shavy femini thing) the cleancut does a nice a job. Only takes a minute or so a day, or even every other day. I sometimes do it a little longer because it kinda feels cool.      I use energizer rechargeable batteries because it does seem to eat them up. I pretty much put a new battery in after every use. New non-rechargeable batteries may last longer but I still think it would be expensive. If you don&#x27;t want to recharge batteries you&#x27;re probably better off going with a rechargeablr cleancut.</li>
    <li> Would have a total melt down if i do not use this every day, for facial hair and more.  LOVE IT !!!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth the money spent on it.  Got it home and it turned out to be an epic failer. Nothing else to say about it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all !!!!! With any size hair I still have to use a razor, if its to good to be true it must be!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, who likes to keep her bikini area completely hair-free and is a bit OCD about it.  She is blonde and her hair is soft and fine.  This unit works perfectly. It&#x27;s virtually impossible to get nicked by it, so shaves are not time consuming. Neither of us could tell the difference in results between professional waxing and the shaver, either by appearance or touch.  The negative reviews mostly complain that it didn&#x27;t shave at all.  It must depend on your hair type. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t recall reading where anyone descibed their hair type.  So why not 5 stars?  It&#x27;s a bit pricy compared to other personal shavers.  But, for the results we get, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  It has been several years since I wrote my review.  The aforesaid wife &amp; I parted company and she got possession of the shaver.  I, however, just bought another one for myself.  It seems the product has not changed in the intervening years, something I consider a plus.  I use this on my groin area. My hair is mostly gray and fairly stiff.  I mainly use Bare Balm, which I reviewed separately and thing is great.  However, I decided to use this in between and when I don&#x27;t have time for the more involved balm.  It did a pretty good job of eliminating most of the remaining hairs.  Since the hair is still there below the surface, it does not give as good a result as Bare Balm, but it&#x27;s about as good as can be expected for electric shaving.  The best part is, it is virtually impossible for it to grab or nick.  I definitely recommend this over any other personal shaver I have tried (including much more expensive ones such as Braun and Panasonic).</li>
    <li> This works great for underarms!&lt;br /&gt;I have a tendency to get the ingrown hairs when I use regular razors.  Plus they don&#x27;t seem to fit well under the arm sometimes.  I apply a small amount of baby powder or corn starch first, then use this.  Gives a nice close cut.&lt;br /&gt;I can then shower and apply deodorant afterwards without irritations.</li>
    <li> The Cleancut ES412 Personal Shaver is wonderful if you want to get a really close shave in sensitive areas (i.e., underarms, nipples, or genital areas). You have to get the hair cut close to the skin before using this battery operated shaver. I also bought the Cleancut PS335 T-shape battery operated razor to do this (also an excellent product).   The ES412 has a rounded head and is small enough to get into any crevice or curve that you want to shave. There is a very thin foil covering the blade which means that you are cutting the hair as short as it can be cut when you stretch the skin tight. I never would have imagined that being clean cut could be such a wonderful feeling until I bought this razor. I have had the shaver for about a month, and my wife and I both love it. (For guys who are thinking of using this shaver, I have read a number of reports that being clean cut has become very common.)  You will probably need to use the shaver every couple of days, or you will need to use the PS335 T-Shape Shaver again to cut the hair down to the right length. I do not know how you could ever nick yourself with the ES412 unless there was a hole in the foil. You can shave safely in the most sensitive areas on your genitals without fear of cutting yourself. If you want to shave in sensitive areas, I do not think that there could be a better product. You can also use baby powder with the razor although its use is not required. If you have sensitive skin, it can help.  In doing research on the internet, I found that there are some imitators out there. There is especially one with a claim (which I felt to be dubious) to have made some technological improvements to the ES412. I could not find any reviews that backed up the claim. Whether the claim is true of not, I find the ES412 to do as good a job as I would ever want.</li>
    <li> This thing is a light weight, it takes too many passes with this shaver to get an area of your face clean. Disappointing!</li>
    <li> I think this is the best product for bikini shaving.  It only works on stubble that is one or two days old. Anything longer and you will need to use another shaver first, but for regular maintenance, this is what you want.</li>
    <li> As long as your are trimmed pretty closely like I am already already this baby works great. I can get my pubic area as smooth as silk. Powder up first, helps immensely. You really have to use it like every day or too be totally smooth. If I left the hair get too long it does not work very well. If that happens I just use a razor in the shower. I&#x27;ve been shaving it all off for about 25 years and this is shaver gets it really close as long as it is used properly.</li>
    <li> Like others before me have said, the Cleancut barely cuts. I returned it and went for the Philips Norelco 7100, best decision after the fact.</li>
    <li> I hate it.................It was just like any other shaver it was not worth having and I will never order a shaver again</li>
    <li> As long as you keep the hair pretty short, it does a pretty good job.  Using powder is key to it gliding smooth on your skin.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work.  It literally cuts nothing.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend the shaver, as it does a great job on facial hair for those of us&lt;br /&gt;over 50!!!</li>
    <li> The product work as described I do like it&lt;br /&gt;Better than similar products I had my for several days now, working good&lt;br /&gt;Product exceeds my expectations</li>
    <li> not as good as I expected for the price.  Had trouble with the head not shaving well as I expected.  Wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on another, sorry.</li>
    <li> The reviews I read were all so wonderful, made me buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once i received it, I was so disappointed. did absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because the price for a monthly bikini wax was really adding up! I was excited when it arrived, only to be quickly disappointed. I would not recommend this product. It only works if your hair is a certain length, and the shave isn&#x27;t very close. After spending 50 dollars on this product, I threw mine away and now I&#x27;m still searching for a good cheap and efficient alternative..</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver for my wife, she keeps her bikini area shaved and hates razor nicks, she has only used the shaver a couple weeks but loves it already, she is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I really like this personal shaver.  It wasn&#x27;t as close of a shave as I would have liked, but it did do the job and works great:)</li>
    <li> Quick, easy, and leaves skin smooth. Hair must be no longer than stubble to be effective otherwise it needs to be pre-trimmed before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I just started using the CS, time will tell in terms of durability.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend because I love mine.  I have had wonderful use of blades and batteries.  Both last a very long time.  The shaver does not bite and is very easy to keep clean.</li>
    <li> It does do a good job if the hair you&#x27;re trying to shave is very short. It does leave the skin very soft after you use it but to maintain the soft hairless skin it must be used everyday. I wish it had a rechargeable battery.</li>
    <li> Barely worked at all.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this shaver would actually work well at the bikini line, but was greatly disappointed.  It was not any better than other shavers in preventing ingrown hairs.  Very disappointing and no longer using this product.</li>
    <li> Works really great. Hair has to be short. Best way to maintain a brazillian without wax.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t as sharp blade at all!</li>
    <li> After only a few weeks of using it - it started running down - I thought it was the battery but I changed and it still runs down after about 30-45 sec. of running it. you can twist the top and get it turning again but not for long. When it did work it was OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this I had the body bare - I&#x27;m defiantly going back to that. I had it for about 2 years before it wouldn&#x27;t recharge and I had to replace it.</li>
    <li> I dread shaving in the shower so this was a nice alternative. It takes much longer and you need to use it more often to maintain smoothness but it&#x27;s something I could do while I watched tv so I didn&#x27;t mind. Took me awhile to perfect the technique and really get smooth, I found that going once over my legs in small circles and then back over again in long strides up and down got me the best results. I had no intention of returning or complaining about the item but it did just stop working after about 2 months of use, battery change didn&#x27;t resolve the issue so I&#x27;ll be returning for the refund instead of exchanging because in the end, I&#x27;d rather have the money back and a smoother shave that lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised, but it did create a nick the first time used, but not since. A good buy and well made. Definitely only for short hair.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with my purchase.  Extremely easy to use &amp; clean.  Leaves skins smooth without nicks or cuts. No more $ wasted on razors that are $5 each, but can only be used once or twice for the best shave. This shaver will pay for itself in a month!!</li>
    <li> The unit is unique and easy to use, however, it is not as efficient as advertised.  Cleanup with a razor is required for stubs.</li>
    <li> I only rated this one star because zero stars wasn&#x27;t available. I bought this so I could get waxed less and it did absolutely nothing. I tried in on different patches of hair to see if maybe that mattered but still nothing. I immediately sent the cleancut back and I would NOT recommend this product for anyone.</li>
    <li> Actually I&#x27;m pretty boring and pedantic man. And I have two ratings normal and bad&lt;br /&gt;But this tool good surprised me. It&#x27;s really perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I have allergic skin and for me this device solved my problem.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expected that. The streamer is very weak. It is not so secure, I even got hurt.&lt;br /&gt;Other wise looks hi-end.</li>
    <li> This device is awesome!!! I read some posts for dissatisfied customers which made me hesitate in making the purchase initially. Then I read other posts from satisfied customers and they gave very good instructions on how to use the product correctly. I would recommend getting the talc and the Cleancut PS335 T-Shape Personal Shaver. This shaver is used to bring the longer hairs to a shorter length so the #S412 Personal Shaver can do its work. The initial user took a while until I was at a point that satisfied me, completely smooth. I took my time and went in different directions to get all the hairs and I did not stop until I heard no more hairs being cut. I am more than pleased with the results and I see myself maintaining this on a weekly basis. I was a user of an electric wet/dry shaver but I found that I was too aggressive and on my last experience I had to visit my doctor to relieve the pain from the razor bumps and nicks I had. I will never go back to that again. This is the only thing that I will ever use.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything more that a micro clippers (still leaves stubble). I can&#x27;t get stubble hair to go through foil and get cut down.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really lift any hair. Had to return.</li>
    <li> Did not cut hair as expected!</li>
    <li> As the description and instructions advise, this thing is only intended for cutting short hair. My wife found it worthless for her under arms. For body hair that is not as course or on an area that is sensitive, this will work with some patience.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write long reviews and I&#x27;m not about to start but...I read a lot of these product reviews and figured the consumer would know best!  It MAY work for some but this thing does NOT work for me.  I followed all directions, bought the damn corn starch made sure the hair was very short...nearly invisible and I&#x27;m sorry....it just does NOT cut off the hair.  I will sadly be returning this and I sure hope they don&#x27;t recycle it because holy vow I don&#x27;t want somebody else&#x27;s cutter that was returned so why would you want mine, right?!</li>
    <li> It is handy, don&#x27;t have to worry about cutting your self. My husband says it is a close enough shave for him so... Does not shave the bikini line at all though.Good for the underarms. I am still searching for a great one!</li>
    <li> After reading reviews, felt this would be a good grooming tool. FAR from it. It does not really do much at all. VERY disappointed! Dont waste your money!</li>
    <li> it works well on short hair but no good for long hair</li>
    <li> First I have to shave with my regular shaver, then follow up with this to get a smooth shave.  I didn&#x27;t realize it would take so much work, but I guess it&#x27;s better than stubble and ingrown hairs.  You have to keep the routine up, though.</li>
    <li> I have owned this shaver before but after a few years of use it broke. I was lazy and didn&#x27;t feel the need to replace it for a long time, so I was happy to see that they are still being sold! It gets every single hair and shaving is almost effortless (as long as you use enough powder). I love the smooth feeling! Definitely cannot get that with a razor.</li>
    <li> It does not do what it purports to do, ie give a clean shave on my pubic area.  I already had very short hairs so the length of hair was not an issue, it did not do its job!</li>
    <li> I doesn&#x27;t work at all! I use it for several times on the same area (bikini area) and different direction and nothing happened!!!! No smooth at all and the hair (less than 1/2 inch) were still there. Definitely a waste of money,</li>
    <li> I got this shaver to deal with the stubble left behind after shaving down under. No matter how much you try, a traditional razor does not deal with all the hair. What I do now is use a regular razor and bikini trimmer to get me down to the final shape. Then comes in the Cleancut + powder to deal with the rest. It is a slow process and I have to continually go over the same area but the results cannot be denied. My bikini zone including the delicate areas is smooth without having to deal with a wax. Yay!!</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. It&#x27;s safe to use and does a good job specially around the bikini area. This is the 3nd shaver I have bought. Previously I bought the same product but lasted several years and died (Maybe 4 years. I don&#x27;t remember exactly). I like the product so I bought it again and again.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely wonderful.  After reading several great reviews about this being the best body shaver we decided to purchase and it is correct.  Will never buy another!</li>
    <li> Closest shave there is bar none.  We have tried numerous others after which you try this and find more hair left.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product I could use while I am undergoing electrology for hair removal. This is the only product that I can use on my underarms that does not give me ingrowns. I still get ingrowns along my bikini line, though. I have also started using it on my neck and chin daily. I used to wax, but this was causing the hair to grow back thicker and with more ingrown and black hairs. Using this on my neck and chin instead of wax will tide me over until I get electrology done on this area, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, within the week of buying it, I dropped it and ever-so-slightly dented the foil on the top. This made the whole thing off kilter and I had to buy a new foil//blade package for $25 at the cheapest. I&#x27;d recommend wrapping a rubber band around the shaft so it doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hands as easy while using it, especially since they&#x27;re most likely covered in shaving powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also changed the batteries recently, so it definitely eats through those quickly. However, I&#x27;m still very happy I finally decided to give in and buy this. Hasn&#x27;t completely solved my hair problems, but has definitely alleviated some of them.</li>
    <li> This did not really work for me like I had hoped. I am Italian though so my hair is fairly coarse. It might eventually get my hair down to a smooth state but I feel like it would take hours and hours. Yes I did trim the hair short and used a bunch of baby powder so it was dry.  I think I&#x27;m going to stick with regular old shaving from now on.</li>
    <li> Brand new! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This is my second cleancut shaver. The first one was damaged after being droppped on a hard surface. Fortunately, it lasted almost ten years before being damaged. These things are very reliable, as long as you don&#x27;t drop them on a hard&lt;br /&gt;Floor. The cleancut leaves your skin feeling baby smooth every time you use it. I also like how quiet and long lasting the battery lasts in this shaver.</li>
    <li> This product just didn&#x27;t work for me.  Hard to use and doesn&#x27;t cut well.  Really disappointed with this.  Back to expensive razors.</li>
    <li> This product was very disappointing. I had purchased it for my &amp;#34;personal&amp;#34; area. It did not remove or trim the hair so it was smooth.  I ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> I get the closest shave with this little gadget, I love it!!! you have to work it around and hold the skin taut but absolutely the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. I use it everyday, no nicks and no hair bumps!!</li>
    <li> i have 2, love both of them, great for on the go shaving</li>
    <li> Lousy hair removal.  Leaves a stub..not worth the money</li>
    <li> I thought this would be a good purchase with the overall reviews. However, I don&#x27;t think this shaver is worth the money. It doesn&#x27;t get close or pick up all the hairs. Maybe it would work ok for someone with fine hair but it definitely doesn&#x27;t work for me. It you think it will work as good as a razor forget it!</li>
    <li> This thing is a little pricey for what it is but it does something no other shaver can do, it lets you shave those really sensitive spots without fear of painful nicks and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work? Yes, if you&#x27;re a male and have wondered how some guys can possibly get seemingly impossible private areas to be smooth and hairless? Well this is how, the Cleancut has tiny holes that let hair in to the shaving blades but keep skin out. This means you need to start with stubble and work your way down to smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend at a resort told my GF and I about this shaver, he even sent me the link to it on Amazon. Be sure to order some size C batteries, it runs on one and it lasts fairly long, but you&#x27;ll definitely want a spare. This shaver is easy to clean. It came with a little brush and a clear protective plastic cover over the shaving-screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good shaving to all.</li>
    <li> I liked the great reviews I read, but also had some misgivings about the handful of very negative reviews.  I bought it anyway!  I shaved the area down very close with a hair (salon) trimmer, like the directions say.  Then when I went to use this shaver I was sorely disappointed!  I ran it over and over and over my skin and it wouldn&#x27;t trim anything.  I wasn&#x27;t going to leave that wickedly itchy stubble there so I used Nair and got most of the stubble off.  THEN I went back with this little shaver and tried it again.  What a world of difference!!!  It got me very smooth and soft.  It works only when the hair is very short - stubble.  If  you think it&#x27;s short, it might still not be short enough.  Try again.  I also discoverd that the areas where the hair lies flat against my skin (instead of sticking straight out), the shaver does not work quite as well - it&#x27;s slightly prickly in those spots.  But all in all, I really like this shaver and am happy that I decided to try trimming even shorter.</li>
    <li> ZERO STARS if I could. I most certainly got a bum one because it doesn&#x27;t work for crap. Even trying it on fine fuzz on my forearms in the sunlight to make sure, it removes NOTHING. Unfortunately I threw away the packaging before trying it because I ASSUMED it would work. I had even bought a replacement blade to go with it in anticipation that it would work fine and that I&#x27;d have it on hand when the old blade was ready to go. I put in the new blade to be sure, and it still does absolutely nothing. It SOUNDS like it&#x27;s doing something, but basically the blades just whir around and don&#x27;t shear, cut, or shave a damn thing. I&#x27;ll have to contact Amazon customer service to see what can be done here. It&#x27;s garbage, and I&#x27;m just as mad at the money I threw away as I am at my stupidity for discarding the return slip and the packaging before trying it out. I definitely need a replacement to see if I simply got a lemon. Stay tuned.</li>
    <li> I expected so much more from this shaver after the reviews.    Fact is, I use the trimmer, this shaver and I still blade shave. Save yourself the time. Just buy the trimmer to use before blade shaving.    The quality of manufacture of this shaver is high but it does not shave as closely as advertised.</li>
    <li> Almost every time I use this shaver I think to myself, &#x27;you need to rate this on Amazon!&#x27; I never rate anything on Amazon but I thought this is a great product so I am finally getting to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing - this shaver only missed the fifth star because where your hairs lay flat it can take a little extra time to get the shaver to cut them. Really I would have loved to give this a 4.5 but there is no option for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do I think this shaver is so great? Mostly because I have really sensitive skin. I&#x27;m essentially maintaining a Brazilian so shaving every day irritates my skin. This is great because if you use it every day, or like every other day, it works to keep you super soft AND is super gentle on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely for just a couple days of growth so be sure to do an initial shave to start you off and then maintain it with this guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story? If you have sensitive skin this may change your whole experience of shaving, if not, you&#x27;re better off just shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helped!</li>
    <li> It didnt work that well on taking the hair off! It needs some more work! But i like the small size  and runs on battery so no power cords!</li>
    <li> Without getting razor stubble or burns, this shaver gets close and smooth in personal areas.  The &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; battery lasts a long time and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to stay as short-haired as I would like to without this shaver!</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace one that I had for many years.  There is nothing else like it and I have never seen it in a store.</li>
    <li> Oh my! I was worried by the bad reviews, but I am so happy that I took the good to heart. This thing is amazing. It showed up in the mail 3 days after I ordered it, I went to the store to find some (talc-free ladies!) body powder and went to town. For sure my first time took a LONG time, it&#x27;s been 3 days since I fully shaved so the regrowth was a good length to poke through the foil. For one, my skin feels amazing, not tender at all, and the shave is actually closer than I can get with a 4 blade razor, oil, and foam together! I suspect this is better for women with coarser pubic hair. I am Italian, with some Scottish and Polish that used to make my dark hair show through my skin, one deliberate shave with this baby and that&#x27;s not a problem any more!</li>
    <li> Great personal trimmer for the body. Batteries dont last too long, but I dont know of anything else out there that does what this little trimmer does in smoothness and closeness.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest little personal shaver you will ever find. First off, you must trim the &amp;#34;bearded&amp;#34; area closely with a trimmer or scissors. Doing this will allow this baby to really &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; for all those SPECIAL areas you want silky smooth. Then just follow up once or twice a week to keep it gone.</li>
    <li> Ok, when I got it delivered I was expecting something a little bit bigger for the money I paid. It&#x27;s pictured with an old iphone4, we all know how small an iPhone 4 is. I looked at this thing and thought I got roped into buying another piece of crap! Boy was I right. This thing is a piece of s***. It doesn&#x27;t shave anything. Not even stubble. It basicly just makes noise..&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money. I don&#x27;t care what the other reviews say. This thing sucks!!! I tried everything to get it to shave and it responded by doing nothing. A butter knife will give you a better shave.</li>
    <li> High quality product and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Way better than expected</li>
    <li> Does not work as described. No where near the closeness that bit says it does</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. You need to use a trimmer first, then use this product and maintain as required. Much better than shaving &amp; no pain.</li>
    <li> Overall, very pleased with the performance, but be aware that this will not shave longer hairs.  You need to start with something else (a bladed shaver, or another electric shaver) and then use this frequently enough to keep the hair from getting too long.</li>
    <li> not as good as claimed</li>
    <li> I just received this today, and after just one use, I feel like this is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.  Seriously, I&#x27;ve already called several friends to recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave up on removing hair in the nether regions years ago, because I just never could find a good solution to the various problems presented by it.  Shaving with a regular razor is time consuming, and leaves skin red, angry and covered in razor burn.  Not to mention the impossibility of getting all the hair without slicing yourself up.  Waxing is effective, but expensive and inconvenient to have done at a salon.  Depilatory creams don&#x27;t work too well and are kind of terrifying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to use &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; electric shavers for bikini area grooming before, but they never achieved anything resembling a close shave. Mostly I was just left with itchy, unattractive stubble.  I heard about this shaver on Reddit.  Apparently a lot of porn stars swear by it.  After reading the reviews on Amazon, I was convinced, and ordered it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the advice of both the manufacturer and numerous other reviewers, and used a cornstarch based body powder prior to shaving.  The shaver glided effortlessly over my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-YES, this thing really will get you baby smooth.  I had shaved with a regular razor two days prior (so the hair was the required length) and it took me all of two minutes to shave completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-There is no possible way you could cut or nick yourself with this.  You don&#x27;t even need a mirror or any sense of caution.  Just go to town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The size and shape of this is perfect for the genital area.  Gets in every nook and cranny with ease.  I&#x27;m sure it would be great for men, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Leaves skin silky smooth and causes ZERO irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this product just could not be any better.  I&#x27;m just upset that I didn&#x27;t try this years ago!  It&#x27;s totally a game changer.</li>
    <li> Terrible razor burn and not even a close shave. Threw away 50 bucks on this</li>
    <li> It must be used in a very specific way to get any outcome at all. When it did produce any results, it lasted a day, yet i heard it was supposed to last two weeks. It is not worth spending so much money on.</li>
    <li> The shaver worked well the first time, but after that, it wasn&#x27;t as smooth.  Tried new batteries, but still not as smooth as first time.  A bit disappointed for the money spent.</li>
    <li> I bought this years ago and it never worked. Basically it&#x27;s just an expensive noise maker. At the time I had read great reviews for it so I bought it. Tried it several time making sure skin was dry but it never worked at all. Should have returned it but at time I was too lazy. I must have gotten dud.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife who had something simular to this one for years. So far it is getting the job done. She loves it.</li>
    <li> It works ok. Is there another item that goes with this that either preps the skin before or after or to use to smooth .using ES412. A friend of mine had another device they used before are after but I never found it any where on your site. Please inform me if there is a additional item. Thank you!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok to use as a travel shaver....only if you maintain your hair growth and use it daily.  It takes a long time to remove body hair, people just don&#x27;t have the time.  But it is great to use on the face daily.  I would not have bought this if I had known this to be the case.</li>
    <li> Still need a trimmer to cut hair real short for this to shave...</li>
    <li> This product was really bad it doesn&#x27;t even cut facial hair one bit totally useless waste off money...very disappointed with the shaver</li>
    <li> It literally doesn&#x27;t do anything. I couldn&#x27;t get it to remove a single hair on my body no matter where I used it. DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
    <li> I use this nearly every day for unwanted, fast growing hair. Just pull the skin back, run it over a few times at an angle, check for missed spots, and you&#x27;re done! I&#x27;d say this is best for minimal facial or body hair. Leg hair can be a hassle simply because of the volume. It does the job, but not if you let it grow out too much. The battery life was said to be fairly short, but I haven&#x27;t had to replace it even once, and it&#x27;s been seven months! I highly suggest this for women and men wanting a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> We were very disappointed.  This is the kind of shaver you buy to shave lint from a clothing item, not to shave your bikini line.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t appear to cut anything.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t groom, blades don&#x27;t cut or trim anything</li>
    <li> Third one we have purchased all have worked extremely well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine. Not as great for trimming short facial hair as reported</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is just me or what.  I have tried shaving against the grain, in circular motion, placing it directly down on top of the upraised hair. I even applied powder.  Nothing works.  this thing is useless as a razor.  Might make a nice paperweight, though...</li>
    <li> This thing is dangerous. The blades could easily injure your nether regions.</li>
    <li> Did exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is THE VERY BEST electric shaver I&#x27;ve EVER USED!!!!  No nicks, cutting or pulling...AND BEST OF ALL NO REDNESS  after...the shaved area is like a babies po-po ..smooth clean  and clear</li>
    <li> biggest piece of crap ever - does not cut anything..throw it in the garbage</li>
    <li> Great product. Clean after each use and you will have it for a lifetime. Helps if your prone to razor bumps from a regular blade razor. Takes a little getting use to</li>
    <li> Pretty smooth when shaving the ole kitty cat. But I will say I do have to go over a couple of times to get all of the hair. Thats not bad tho because it usually happens with any razor. Very happy to have found this one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shaver and a shaver only. I thought it would be this revolutionary new hair removal device and honestly it&#x27;s not any different from a regular razor except that you can&#x27;t get as close a shave. This was bought specifically to try and tame the bikini line, but I bet for men it works better.</li>
    <li> This little jewel will get you baby bottom smooth!</li>
    <li> Works great, the only issue is holding on to it without dropping it.  Add a self adhesive ace bandage around the outside and everything is practically perfect.</li>
    <li> make sure you don&#x27;t push it onto your skin because IT WILL IRRITATE it. I learned this the hard way when I was shaving a very very sensitive part.</li>
    <li> Does not cut/trim very well. Will not cut long hair only very short hair. Is very patchy on short hair. Threw away after one use.</li>
    <li> Does an awesome job! Very close shave.</li>
    <li> Not worth the trouble!! Doesn&#x27;t shave very close at all!!</li>
    <li> Very quiet and compact size make this easy to travel with. Gives a good close shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife three years ago and just replaced it because we lost it on vacation.  She uses it about twice a week.  If you are starting with any hair longer than just a stubble length, first use the Cleancut-PS335-T-Shape-Personal-Shaver/ or anything to remove the length.  Take your time, move slowly, stretch the skin and firmly press the shaver into the skin for best results.  My wife loves it and it saves her the money and time from going for a wax.  Use powder at the end for a &amp;#34;baby soft&amp;#34; feel!!  Also I would suggest taking a sharpie and marking the plastic top which can be lost since it is so hard to see among the sheets.  Ken &amp; Leslie</li>
    <li> Not interested because of same like my electric shaver. Need better razor that easily shave off everything! It is good for traveling.</li>
    <li> This item is pretty awesome especially for those who get razor burn easily! I suggest you shave your bits FIRST, and then use this for daily maintenance to keep yourself smooth. Lubricate the area with cornstarch first so no tugging.</li>
    <li> The cleancut personal shaver works well in sensitive areas leaving no rash or razor burn.  However it works best if the hairs are already fairly short so its best for upkeep and maintenance versus achieving that first initial shaving.</li>
    <li> While I can&#x27;t speak for every instance of this product the one I received today proved that it could be dangerous if defective. I received the item today and after removing it from the packaging I checked to make sure the foil head was attached securely, placed the battery in (it takes one C Cell) and began to test it. The entire top part flew off with such force that it and the blades spun across the room and narrowly missed cutting my face. I repackaged the item immediately and am reshipping for a refund.</li>
    <li> This is actually the coolest shaver. I didn&#x27;t think it was possible to shave that close to the skin without using a razor.&lt;br /&gt;It does take a bit of getting used to but once you&#x27;ve got the hang of it it really is quite effective.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t think of doing large areas like legs with it but for bikini line I find it works really well.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean as well which is always good!</li>
    <li> It works good in the easy to shave areas, but it does not cut the tough to get hair no matter how many passes or different angles. Not the smooth shave we expected It does provide some irritation because you have to make so many passes with it.  The price of this unit is way too high for the quality of the shaver.  It also remindes me of those lint shavers for your clothing,</li>
    <li> This did not seem to remove or trim any hair no matter what I tried. Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t even feel like it has a blade or cutting device in it at all. Going through my things during a recent move I threw it out. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Ordered this, then realized it to C batteries so I had to go out and buy those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product didn&#x27;t work at all.  I followed the instructions and even used baby powder but it would not cut any hair at all.  I tried using on my face where conditions are more ideal and it took about 5 minutes to remove half my stubble.</li>
    <li> If you buy this, understand it does not give you a very close shave and it takes a long time to get all of your hair. It is good for avoiding razor burn, cuts, and ingrown hairs, though, so worth it if you have this problem. It is kind of loud, so be aware that others in rooms close by can hear it, and if you are looking to be discreet you&#x27;ll have to be alone to secretly use it.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the buy for the bikini in the summer.</li>
    <li> It  works ok.  You do need to do several &amp;#34;de-hair&amp;#34; methods before you get to this stage.  You WILL need powder or some buffer.  I found I still bled using this product. I still try it from time to time.  I think it would work better if used daily.  You won&#x27;t get 100% smooth clean de-haired surface, but it does a pretty decent job.</li>
    <li> I have owned one of these before. No catches or cuts. General shave and clean no hair.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Can use it without cutting myself and get in tight places.  It is very easy to use too.</li>
    <li> it is gentle in those sensitive and hard to reach places, but it doesn&#x27;t cut very well. for its price i expected better. also it uses c batteries which i don&#x27;t use for anything else.</li>
    <li> This shaver is an excellent device so far in my first uses. I was led to this product after searching for options to remove unwanted body hair from sensitive areas. It works as advertised, and is safe to use on or near your genitals, armpits, backs of knees, etc. The shaving blades are not ultra razor sharp, but the design of the device allows for a clean and close shave despite this fact. That in mind, it&#x27;s an oscillating bladed tool, so still be careful during use and cleaning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will get a very close shave after repeat strokes to the same area. The instructions recommend pre-applying a powder for an easier glide and closer shave. I did not have any powder at the time I used it, but got a sufficiently close shave without. Only one warning, do not make as many passes over the area between the genitals and the anus. Repeat passes over that area cased me a slight burning sensation (which didn&#x27;t last too long). Also no batteries included, the shaver uses C type batteries. Large amounts of hair removal will require frequent cleaning-out of the shave head, which is simple (instructions provided).</li>
    <li> Overall: 10/10&lt;br /&gt;Pros: light, small, and easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none.</li>
    <li> OK product but does not work well with longer stubble, good price and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> My Cleancut stopped working 2 days ago,the motor started sounding funny then it just stopped spinning all together.I liked it when it worked,but it gave out too fast,even tho i followed the instructions that came with the product..</li>
    <li> As swingers, it&#x27;s socially critical that we both maintain a clean, smooth, brush-free field of play. For her it&#x27;s pretty easy, just using a razor and some Choochi Cream gets the job done nicely. But for him, a regular razor leaves a bloody aftermath that&#x27;s no fun for anyone. The Cleancut gets the job done beautifully, with no pain or scars. He&#x27;s been using this for 4 years now (this is his 3rd order, as the blade does eventually wear out) and nothing else comes close. HIGHLY recommended for swingers and anyone else who wants some smoothness &#x27;down there&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This little shaver is great- very convenient!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised! I shave  almost daily and still feel a little stubble but this took it down to the skin with no issues.</li>
    <li> This makes my junk nice and smooth and now my wife doesn&#x27;t mind the longer PT sessions in bed.  Not good for long hair but only for stubble!</li>
    <li> it worked fine &#x27;for 3 weeks&#x27; then the motor quit.</li>
    <li> This item didn&#x27;t work at all. It works with a C battery which I didn&#x27;t have readily available in my home so I bought it a few weeks after I received this item. However, it would not turn on. Unfortunately the return date was passed based on the return policy and I couldn&#x27;t return it anymore. So, I have a brand new piece of equipment which doesn&#x27;t work and my money is wasted.&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this item, first thing you need to do when you receive the item is to check and make sure it works fine.</li>
    <li> I got this product and this product sucks didn&#x27;t work at all the blades do not cut. The blades seemed dual didn&#x27;t cut at all seemed to need new blades.</li>
    <li> I had thoroughly researched a personal shaver for shaving personal places and this one came up repeatedly. Following all the tips of using powder, circular motions, and starting out with short hairs, it worked with no problems at all for a smooth shave and no razor burn.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be effective based on its claims. It has basically been sitting in a drawer since I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Not for me.&lt;br /&gt;My wife absolutely loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I find the blade head a bit fragile.&lt;br /&gt;Dropped it once and it is a pain to put it back.</li>
    <li> Like a Braxilian wax, without the pain.  Also does great touch-ups on me.  Both the wife and I love it.</li>
    <li> The product is as advertised and works great - as long as you follow some basic requisites. You&#x27;ll need to trim down as far as you can with trimmers, clippers, etc., and then use talc or baby powder on the area you want to shave. Take it section by section and go slowly, using multiple passes in a circular motion over the area. Once you don&#x27;t hear the &#x27;crunch&#x27; of the blade cutting any residual stubble, check your work - it&#x27;ll be as smooth as silk. Try to shave at least every other day since it doesn&#x27;t handle longer stubble all that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil shaver is ultra comfortable and very quiet. The weight feels good in your hand and cleanup is easy. If anything happens to it, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order again.</li>
    <li> This is the third one of these I have purchased. Normally after about 2 years, the motor stops producing enough power to work properly - even after replacing battery, oiling, and cleaning. However, this latest unit stopped working after 1 week. This is a cheaply made product with a motor much too small to have any longevity. The frustrating thing is that there does not exist any other product like it or more durable....</li>
    <li> Not as good as listed.</li>
    <li> This thing sucks. Dont bother wasting your money. I bought this because I wanted an easier was to shave but there are some stubble it wont get no matter what. whats the point? might as well wet shave.</li>
    <li> As a male using this product, all I can say is: wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I was amazed that males could even accomplish such a feat as shaving their scrotum. I did a little research and discovered that there were shavers on the market that claimed to do so. And painlessly! (I must say that I cannot, for the life of me, imagine doing this with a razor.) After a bit more research I settled on the Cleancut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first shave was kind of rough. First I had to get rid of the bulk of the hair, which I did in the bathtub using the trimmer on my old electric shaver. (The hard part was getting started.)Then I went at it with the Cleancut. The results were not perfect. For one thing I didn&#x27;t use any baby powder or talc. And I found I ended up with quite a few long hairs which the Cleancut would not work on. Eventually I got those with the trimmer. I had a bit of chafing, apparently caused by pressing too hard or too long on the shaver. Bikini Zone cream (lidocaine 2%)works wonders on these areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second shave was a dream. After showering I applied a liberal amount of baby powder. I then shaved my package with the Cleancut. It was fast, smooth and effortless. No need to press hard. No cuts, no nicks, and no chafing. Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bum. Really. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The first Clean Cut shaver we got fell apart on first use but as normal at Amazon a replacement was on its way right away.  Way to go Amazon!  I was fearful the same would happen with the replacement but it worlks fine.  The micro screen is held in the cap with a retaining ring and the screen came disloged on the original one and was impossible to replace...it must be pressed in.  So back it went.  In use the little unit works fine.  You need to be shaving stubble but this thig works great.  Any longer hair needs trimmed with a regular razon, shaver, or the specially made trimmer by Seiko.  I think my personal beard-moustashe, body trimmer would probably work too.  Goodby razor bumps.  I bought a bottle of the Sween powder initially and have continued to use it.  I blow the unit out with a can of \\&quot;air duster\\&quot; like you use on computers and that works slick as could be.  The powder residue on the shaver body mkes it a bit slippery so be careful. Oh, the sween powder that I originally selected was only 3 ounces nd I found out  that for 75 cents more I could get 8 ounces...a more substantial bottle.  Throw an old towel over the toilet seat cover and use it there or over the bowl if you are really careful.  Dropping it into the water would surely ruin it.  Been using a month on the first battery.  I bought a 4 pack of good grade Duracells.  So far we are happy.  Very smooth cut.  The only problem are hairs that grow parallel to the skin surface.  If you get them in the original trim they are reduced to stubble and the clean cut takes care of them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good shaver the first few times, and then it starts making strange noises like the blade calibration is off. It&#x27;s okay, but the quality is not worth $50. It&#x27;s worth more like $15-$20. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product as a &amp;#34;body groomer&amp;#34; and it works great for me &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;, but it doesn&#x27;t work so good for my wife.  Most of her hairs lay flat and this product just doesn&#x27;t pick them up.  For her, it&#x27;s fine to use this to trim the area, but then use a blade or wax to remove the majority of everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have the Gillette Proglide Styler.  This Cleancut Personal Shaver does a way better job than the Gillette Styler by a country mile, but in the end, I use them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use the Styler to cut the hairs down to a 1/4 to 1/8 and then this to take them down to skin level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this product or purchase it again if it dies?  No not really...</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work at all,waste of money ,would return if I had original package</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a &#x27;personal&#x27; shaver being a somewhat hairy guy. The problem is that the mesh on the top is very fine, so if you have thicker hair it probably won&#x27;t work as it won&#x27;t get through the mesh. I even tried trimming to a stubble and then using this again with no luck. It is easy to handle, and relatively quiet, but if it doesn&#x27;t cut the hair then what&#x27;s the point?</li>
    <li> LOVE this shaver for going completely bare. I use it in two ways - (1) as an everyday shaver that will take the itch off but not leave any razor bumps, or (2) as a pre-shave before I go in with a disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver basically takes short stubble and makes it extremely short stubble. I wouldn&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;smooth enough for a date&amp;#34;, but on its own it is definitely good enough for everyday use... especially considering that I can use this shaver dry, no prep, just move it around in small circles and 5 minutes later I&#x27;m off and running. This, as opposed to a disposable razor where I have to go really slowly and carefully, in the shower, plenty of shaving cream, and 10 minutes later I&#x27;m mostly smooth (I think) but tender and possibly bleeding a little... and I still might get razor bumps despite all the extra effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find that if I use this shaver as a pre-shave before using a disposable razor, I can get a much smoother shave than with either alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it several times a week for about a year. Any time my stubble starts feeling itchy, BOOM, out comes the shaver for a quick touch-up and much relief. I make sure to open it up after every shave and knock out the hairs that have accumulated inside. When it starts going slow or seeming a little less effective, I replace the C-cell battery and it&#x27;s back up and running like a charm. Not a single problem so far, no nicks, no grabbed skin. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend for use on legs. Too much skin area to cover. Not worth the effort.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work as i expected it would..</li>
    <li> Yes, it works perfectly. You need to shave with the razor first, then use this shaver for follow-up shave.&lt;br /&gt;You need to apply powder (i use baby powder) on the area before use. Make sure cleaning inside every time after use.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything. Waste of money</li>
    <li> I purchase this for one use only: to shave my private parts. That&#x27;s its intended use.&lt;br /&gt;I keep myself shaved there, so the hair length wasn&#x27;t a problem. The unit is easy to manipulate and quiet, but it doesn&#x27;t have much power. I guess not much is need if your hair is already short. This works in tandem with the companion product which shaves hair to about a quarter of an inch. I haven&#x27;t tried that, but it&#x27;s the way they are marketed.&lt;br /&gt;I previously used a regular blade razor, but couldn&#x27;t get into all the crevices and occasionally made a small nick and bled a little.&lt;br /&gt;That won&#x27;t happen with this, but I recently switched to using a 3-head electric for my face, and one day just plunged ahead and used it on my privates. It worked well, again, since my hair was already short there. The 3 heads rolled and pivoted over all the crevices and it actually worked better than the Cleancut, so I now use that and this has become extraneous. I did have to use some caution with my regular electric, especially in ensuring the hair is short. I once used it on my underarms when the hair was over half an inch long and it did cause some razor burns. The Cleancut, though, won&#x27;t even work if the hair is too long, so the danger is reduced, but so is the convenience.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the powder method and then I tried a pre-electric, alcohol-based product. I didn&#x27;t like the powder, but the pre-electric is fine if you don&#x27;t have any irritation there, maybe a slight burning sensation at first, but lasting only a few seconds.</li>
    <li> Buy the powder they recommend and a C cell battery follow the directions works great.</li>
    <li> Very good product, work as advertised.</li>
    <li> The other reviews I read for this product were amazing, so I thought I&#x27;d try it out. It works OK...but the hair really does have to be very short (stubble), or it can&#x27;t handle it. I think because the holes in the guard are so small, it can be difficult for the shaver to actually get to the hair. The shave isn&#x27;t super close but it does an OK job. For my skin, it&#x27;s definitely better than having to use a razor every day...so I use a razor about once a week and use this on a daily basis to stay smooth.</li>
    <li> The unit is very light weight and doesn&#x27;t cut too well.  It sounds like it&#x27;s doing something, but leaves a lot.  Back to the razor until I try another brand.</li>
    <li> It does what it was advertised to do but it&#x27;s just so small it takes a long time to get a clean cut.</li>
    <li> Save your money! don&#x27;t buy this piece of sh*t.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Cleancut ES412 Personal Shaver\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t work, a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> This works. Extremely close, smooth shave. Use the powder, make sure hair is stubble like, and roll around in circles over the hair. Sometimes I have to smooth the skin or bunch the skin for hard to reach hairs. I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this shaver.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t cut quite as close as wife or I would like.</li>
    <li> There just isn&#x27;t another product that works as well as this one in shaving very short hair. Long hair must be cut until only stubble remains, but once accomplished, this shaver will maintain a very smooth surface as long as it is used regularly. Miss a few days and it won&#x27;t work. Those who say it doesn&#x27;t work aren&#x27;t using it as it was intended. It shaves stubble and that&#x27;s all, but it does that extremely well. A man who wants to get rid of facial hair after a day at work, will find this just the thing to feel clean shaven at dinner or on a date. It will cut stubble very closely and will not irritate or pull on skin in the process. Easy to clean and a C battery will power it for many uses.</li>
    <li> I was everything I expected.</li>
    <li> I really love this shaver. I wanted to find something to help prevent ingrown hairs from shaving.  I have coarse curly hair and I found that the key to making this work is to use a trimmer first. The trimmer can only cut so low but it leaves the hair at a perfect length for the cleancut shaver to leave your skin feeling really smooth.  I also think that if you trim as low as you can first that the powder isn&#x27;t necessary.</li>
    <li> When I decided to purchase this item, all the reviews were by women.  Needlesstosay, I was a little aprehensive.  The first time I used I, i was expecting blood.  No, seriously.  I bit my lip, closed my eyes and was very happily suprised, no blood, and no stubble and no more high pitched complaints.  More powder is better than not enough powder, I&#x27;ll say that much.  But i use it everywhere I would a regular razor, which says a lot for that high speed spinning blade just a breath away from disaster.  In fact, I bought two and I&#x27;m thinking about buying a third because you can never be too prepared and I hate high pitched complaints</li>
    <li> The foil has very tiny holes. If your hair is thick or curly, it will not pass through the holes and it will not be cut.&lt;br /&gt;I have not been able to cut any of my hair, so examine your hair before buying&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware</li>
    <li> your hair has be very very short for this to work properly but it does do what it says it does, good product! way better than shaving, just trim and Cleancut it</li>
    <li> If you read and follow the instructions this product works great!  Don&#x27;t be afraid to use plenty of powder or reapply powder as needed to prevent any nicks. If you hold the shaver at different angles as you go over areas it will get everything.  I won&#x27;t ever use razors, creams, or wax again.</li>
    <li> This was not what I was expecting - I was looking for a personal shaver that would shave close to my skin so that i could stop using a razor in private area . NOPE - it does not work and it did not even work on my legs or armpits. I sent it back. No problem and was refunded. I am blond hair - do not have super course hair on body so not sure if it would make a difference. That was my experience.</li>
    <li> As a woman I wanted something that would last longer than waxing, hair removal creams, epilators or wet shaving could do &amp; I&#x27;ve found it in this wonderful, small &amp; compact shaver!!</li>
    <li> It did not cut anything. I felt it was a waste of money - and I really wanted to like it. Ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift from my mother in law. She knows that I&#x27;m into shaving the \\&quot;Package Department\\&quot; as she calls it and this little gem works better than I could have imagined. I&#x27;e been using disposable razors and they work just fine, but this thing is awsome. You need to hold the skin tight around your testicles to get a good clean shave. Sometimes I&#x27;ll get some help from my wife or her Mother.</li>
    <li> This shaver is awesome !!!&lt;br /&gt;How did I ever live without it.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, clean, store !&lt;br /&gt;Highly recomednd.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work on most hair lengths other than stubble and 5 o clock shadow even with shaving powder and pulling the skin taunt while shaving.  May be okay if you just need a quick touch up, but honestly it&#x27;s faster just to use a razor because the Cleancut needs to go across the area several times to cut the hair. 2 stars because its small and looks good, and can be used for small touch ups but overall I would pass on this shaver.</li>
    <li> The reviews for this were all pretty good so I decided to try it.  What I found was it&#x27;s not as good as some of the reviews state.  It does a decent job of giving you a close shave in delicate areas but it&#x27;s not that great.  You definitely won&#x27;t get cut or nicked while using this one which is really the only plus.  Over all its a OK product.</li>
    <li> Dont do the job as expected, is more like a toy but would not give as a present to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very very good and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is that you need to trim hair before you use this on your body.&lt;br /&gt;For face, it works well with a 2 day stubble (normal growth).&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is super easy and handling is good as well.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t shave the hair off my arms. I think it must be defective because the reviews were so good. It also looks kinda eh&#x27;. My mom asked what it was when she saw it on my desk, and it hit me lol.</li>
    <li> Decent price for this.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin( can&#x27;t use regular razor) and got this to use for my legs and underarms. I do not use powder as recommended. Works great - takes some time but it doesn&#x27;t chew me up like my other electric razors. You need to stay on top of shaving regularly because it only picks up short hairs. Battery life seems to be good with it too. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Cleancut works as advertized. Unit uses a single \\&quot;c\\&quot; battery that lasts for a reasonable amount of time.  This shaver receives great deal of use, and is still working fine on the original blade.</li>
    <li> After receiving the blade, I cleaned it with hot water and keep it aside and Within a week when I came back to use it, the blade got rusted even the mesh. Now I have to buy the blade assemble ($25 on Amazon)  before using it.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with how this worked. I guess it just works better for some than others. Honestly the little 3-pack Noxzema Bikini Shave &amp; Trim Disposable Shavers I found at Walmart work much better. I would recommend trying that before you spend money on this.</li>
    <li> With proper instruction (thanks to the dvd) and proper use this is a really good personal shaver. Great for the lady bits and when used correctly, shaves very smooth! Waxing is perfection but hurts like hell. This is a very close second!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted a really good quality razor for bikini line and under arms.  This one seemed to fit the bill.  Unfortunately it is a major disapointment.  For the price I wish I had gotten something else.  This just doesn&#x27;t work.  I don&#x27;t want to spend an hour delicately working on hairs growing a certain way, which based on the other reviews seems to be what this requires.  There are a lot of electric shavers out there and most probably better than this one.  If this razor was $20 I would give it a few stars, but at this price, lucky to get one.  Save yourself some cash and go with a different model.</li>
    <li> Why cant you just click the number of stars and be done? Most of time I do not want to go into detail.</li>
    <li> This is not worth the money. It did not work. I was hoping for amazing effects however I was let down. I bought another one from target that was over 1/2 the price and it works so much better.</li>
    <li> My Seiko Cleancut has been working well for 10+ years.    I got tired of feeding it C-cell batteries and found that fresh AAA&#x27;s (I use NiMH rechargables) have all the power needed to run the shaver just as well...tho I must more frequently swap the battery with a freshly recharged one.  But then more frequent battery top-up isn&#x27;t a bad thing because the Seiko won&#x27;t be running on a half-dead C-cell anymore. Spacers to keep the AAA-cell battery snug in the C-cell hole can be bought or made.  However I just packed damp-ish toilet paper in the space between the shaver wall and a well-aligned AAA-cell. . .The pulpy paper spacer firmed up to hold the shape and that works just as well.  When screwing the shaver&#x27;s black base back in, take care that the spring remains in good contact with the AAA-cell&#x27;s smaller negative bottom terminal.    Since my Seiko IS older, I can&#x27;t address whether the current lot works or holds up as well.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver for manscaping. First use a clipper if you are hairy. Then use this shaver. It makes it nice and bald. My girl loves how smooth it gets me. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Does not cut the hair off. I&#x27;m really not happy with this product. Do not buy this item it sucks.</li>
    <li> This product does not work very well. It misses most of the hair causing you to go back over the same spot many times. I found that I was better off using a Braun shaver. It gave me a much closer and faster shave.</li>
    <li> I received this today and I am 100% satisfied.  This is the best shaver for the bikini area.  I was using a electric razor and it pulled and never shaved close enough.  I used baby powder and wow what a smooth shave. I like all hair removed in this area and it is very smooth. I am VERY HAPPY with this product and will by again if this one quits working. Does not pull or nick at all !  😊</li>
    <li> This is the first personal shaver I&#x27;ve ever had, so my experience may not help as much. I use this shaver for just my vaginal/bikini area, which I keep completely hair free. I&#x27;m a big girl which I think affects how well the shaver works. Hair likes to lay differently and with more surface area its easier to get ingrone hairs and harder to pull taut when shaving. Just a fact, not bad, just different. With this shaver I feel like my shave isn&#x27;t as close as I like. Still that ever so slight stubble, and it does take a bit longer than with a razor. HOWEVER, while I don&#x27;t like the feeling of stubble&lt;br /&gt;a) I&#x27;ve never had any complaints from gentlemen friends.&lt;br /&gt;b) It&#x27;s a actually worked out better in the long run, because of that small amount of stubble and lack of a completely clean shave I don&#x27;t get any razor bumps from ingrone hairs (which, if you take care of you skin and uber exfoliate, that problem is less significant anyway).&lt;br /&gt;In the end it just depends on your personal preference vs time. On the quick and easy routes the personal shaver Lea es stubble but no bumps to deal with where as the razor has a clean shave but you&#x27;ll probably have bumps to contend with later... like I said still on the fence. Still give it four stars, because it did better than my initial expectation.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much based on the inconsistent reviews, but I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this shaver. When used as directed (on very short hair &amp; with baby powder), it gives a very close shave. My bf asked if I&#x27;d gotten waxed after the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw one reviewer said he/she had gotten cut by it; I don&#x27;t even see how that&#x27;s possible. I had zero discomfort, no razor burn, nothing. The only reason I am deducting 1 star is that it sometimes takes multiple passes to remove all the hair, so it&#x27;s not a fast process. But I vastly prefer this to waxing (expensive &amp; have to let hair grow back in between waxing) or wet shaving (risk of cuts/razor burn).</li>
    <li> The personal shaver had great reviews. But it doesn&#x27;t work like it&#x27;s stated. I try brand new batteries, and baby powder, etc. I have gone back to just a regular old two blade shaver for better results</li>
    <li> Worthless product. Reviews that this product works are not accurate. It is a rip off and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Good product - doesn&#x27;t cut long hair only short stubbles. Meets my requirement i.e. doesn&#x27;t cut me in anyway and shaves very closely almost like a razor.</li>
    <li> Not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be</li>
    <li> This product works great provided use it every day.</li>
    <li> I love my Cleancut! First to the pros and cons list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to hold and use&lt;br /&gt;Shaves hair you wouldn&#x27;t normally get with a disposable razor&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts long time&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Easy to shave nooks and crannies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Uses C size batteries&lt;br /&gt;Not a dry shaver&lt;br /&gt;Will pinch/nick loose skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review:&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product. Great for keeping a smooth shave. First thing I must mention, is never use this as a dry shaver.  Of course I don&#x27;t suggest using water, but rather baby powder. Being lazy, I&#x27;ll sometimes just shave with only the clean cut. But it&#x27;s important that you use baby powder on the areas the you will be shaving. If you don&#x27;t, you will get razor burn and that&#x27;s never fun. When you use the Cleancut with baby powder you can get a really nice close smooth shave. You&#x27;ll even get hairs that you didn&#x27;t even know were there. You can hear the blade cut whenever you shave a hair and you&#x27;ll be surprised how much it picks up.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I recommend is that you always keep your skin taut while shaving. Not only does this help to pick up all the hairs but it helps prevent nicks. This is mostly true only when shaving more &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; areas.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you use the nice dome shape head to really get all the angles while shaving so you can really get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended product!</li>
    <li> I have always had problems with ingrown hairs but this plus the coloplast baby powder is a freaking miracle! Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Complete waste of 50$. Definitely wish I could have my money back. DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> This did not work the way it was depicted at all. It looked good but it didn&#x27;t shave as well&lt;br /&gt;as my other shavers.</li>
    <li> Second edit:&lt;br /&gt;Happy to report that doing a water shave first, then maintaining every other day &#x3D; perfectly smooth.  I read in another review that the shaver really only works on &amp;#34;5 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34; and I COMPLETELY agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I have to update that although I&#x27;m really pleased with the results, my husband said that the stubble was uncomfortable for him.  I&#x27;m going to try doing a regular shave to get perfectly smooth, then maintaining with this every day or two.  Hoping that works for me and for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I thought it didn&#x27;t do anything.  I&#x27;ve used it twice now and I will say: it&#x27;s very comfortable and safe, but it does take kind of a long time for something I&#x27;m not too interested in spending more than a couple minutes a day on.  While I&#x27;m using it, it seems like it&#x27;s not giving a very close shave...but then when I&#x27;m done, it feels and looks really smooth.  Now, not every single hair is cut...but the ones that are missed seem to be fine and pretty unnoticeable, overall.  I&#x27;ve had no itching or discomfort of any kind and I prefer the results to those of a regular razor.  Might not work if you&#x27;re going for porn-star bare, but if you&#x27;re looking for smooth and mostly bare, I can recommend it.</li>
    <li> A glorified, overpriced lint shaver.  Does not work well on hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a packaged deal with the Seiko Cleancut T-Shape personal shaver.  This product came in a package that appeared to have been previously opened. There was no indication in the ad that stated this product was used or previously opened.  I&#x27;m looking for public hairs in the razor&#x27;s teeth.  Product does not look remotely new</li>
    <li> PLEASE DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT. I THINK I PAID OVER $40 WITH S&amp;amp;H FOR IT, AND DOESN&#x27;T CUT, OR SHAVE ANYTHING.  IT&#x27;S PLAIN &amp;amp; SIMPLE AS THAT, IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK AT ALL. I AM PISSED! IT DOES NOT SHAVE A THING. AND IF SOMEBODY SAY THEY LIKE IT THEY&#x27;RE TELLING A DAMN LIE</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as some reviews said but I can get smooth and reach places I can&#x27;t with a razor. It doesn&#x27;t come with a battery.</li>
    <li> If you are going to look into *personal* shaving, then this is the shaver you are going to want to use. Purchase the Sheen body powder with this shaver and forget razor burn/rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One recurring statement is that this shaver doesn&#x27;t work well with longer hair and that is true...it was never intended to work with longer hair anyway so don&#x27;t give a negative remark for this. Use it as it was intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a trimmer of your choice and trim the hair down to a stubble, apply the Sheen powder and go to work. One technique I found is to hold the shaver like a pen/pencil in your dominate hand. Use your other hand to pull upwards on the skin, and follow behind with the shaver working in a circular pattern against the growth of hair. The pattern of motion is up to you, but a small circular pattern works well. You will *hear* when the shaver is cutting hair...you will know when the sound stops that you are clean. If you keep going though, you CAN create a rash or razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this unit for several months now on (1) battery. Really, it only takes me a few minutes every other day or so to clean right up.</li>
    <li> This is not even good enough to shave lint! If my boyfriend had not hastily thrown out the box from this, I would be returning this $45 piece of crap.</li>
    <li> I would not purchase this item if I had been able to try it first. I went with the recommendations of comments but I don&#x27;t get the results as discribed</li>
    <li> This is a great little product. Comfortable to use, and just all round good at what it does. My girlfriend likes the results very much!</li>
    <li> Very good for those hard to get places, very dependable and durable. Easy to clean and easy to use. Every body needs one!</li>
    <li> Still trying this product out.  After i realize I needed to trim the area before using the trimmer works great.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really give a good review, only in that it didn&#x27;t even work.  I put in the battery and tried to replace the battery cap, which was stripped so it wouldn&#x27;t screw back in properly and would only pop off.  I held the cap down with the battery in place and it still wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  I&#x27;m not sure how well this product works because mine never did.  I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
    <li> Simple, neat, painless</li>
    <li> Works ok. Not a close shave.</li>
    <li> super super super close shave. No stubble for hours. Easy to use and clean. The lil motor is a bit noisy but its a motor, duh.</li>
    <li> Very good for maintaining the clean shaven look in ones private areas.  Note that the shaver is not intended for use for long hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product three times to try and get a clean cut in delicate areas - under my arms, bikini line, behind the knees, etc - and I&#x27;m not entirely pleased with the results. My skin was clean, dry, and lightly dusted with body powder to prevent sticking, but try as I might I could not seem to get the smooth finish I wanted after shaving with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After making several passes over the same patches of skin, I finally got something reasonably close to stubble-free skin. Pull the skin taut and pass against the grain until you feel results, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure I could have gotten the same quality for less money elsewhere, and had I known that I would have bought a different product.  If I learn the secret to a cleancut, I will write a new review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS, this uses a C battery and does not come with one.</li>
