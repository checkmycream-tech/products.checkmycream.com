<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This products does not do well with my fine hair and I do not like the smell - it is somewhat citrus-y but not really pleasant to me.  I don&#x27;t find it works as well as some other drug store brands I use - like L&#x27;Oreal - so I am not planning on buying this again.</li>
    <li> I am not going to be a crazy convert who thinks this is the only conditioner on the planet (though I did buy enough to last me forever), but I do like it. I went on vacation without it, and as always, my hair seemed to enjoy the conditioner of the day supplied by whatever hotel I was in. (Which is why I don&#x27;t think it can be the be-all/end-all of hair care.) But it does lead to a pretty successful proportion of good hair days. My hair especially likes it when I add a little bit in as a leave-in conditioner after I get out of the shower.</li>
    <li> This is an incredibly moisturizing conditioner.  I use it in conjunction with No-Poo and Set it Free.  I &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; with No-Poo, condition with One condition, they apply more as a leave in after my shower.  I follow up with Set it free on my damp hair, and scrunch.  It has brought my hair back to life and beautifully defines my curls.  I love you Devacurl...don&#x27;t ever change!</li>
    <li> This product also smells fantastic.  In addition, it works.  It leaves your hair soft, untangled, and manageable!  I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have fine wavy hair and started using this and the NoPoo shampoo a few weeks ago. It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair. I live in the desert so my hair can get very dry. I also use a bit of the AnGel light gel. I like the results of all three products. I have less frizz and more defined curls.</li>
    <li> My girl&#x27;s hair was really dry and after I start the no poo treatment it is very soft and beautiful. looking healthier than ever.</li>
    <li> I decided to try the Deva Curl products after reading many rave reviews about the wonderful things it did for curly hair. I am horribly sorry that I did.&lt;br /&gt;This product smells like lemon pledge and my hair is dryer after using it than it has ever been. I used it in combination with the Deva Curl Low-Poo Shampoo, and trying to get a comb through my hair after my shower was a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and go get Herbal Essences Totally Twisted product line instead, it does more for my curls than most other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I spent over 80 dollars for four Deva Curl products and I only liked one. Loved the No-Poo Shampoo but the One Condition, Angel and Set It Free did nothing for my 4B hair but make it extra dry. Will buy No-Poo Shampoo again but will leave the other products on the shelf.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner for curly haired people!  Locks in moister, hair feels and looks healthy and shiny!  I would recommend this item!</li>
    <li> After using 1/2 bottle, I am not seeing any results better than products I can purchase in drug stores. hmmm</li>
    <li> I spent over $60 bucks on Deva Curl products after going to a Curls night out sponsored by Deva Curl.  The products worked well on the other ladies and gentlemen but my hair is a dry mess after using this product line.  It is very true that some things work for some people and clearly I am not one of those people.  If you have thick wavy/curly hair I would advise you to buy the sample pack before committing to the  12 oz/ 1 liter bottle of this product!</li>
    <li> I was really looking for more fromt his product.  There is cheaper stuff that does a much better job! It&#x27;s not worth the money!  Not for Black hair!</li>
    <li> I tried this product because it was said to be helpful for my dry, itchy scalp. I can&#x27;t comment on the results of this product, because I will not be using it again! The smell of this product literally made me nauseous. The no-poo shampoo smells wonderful, but this has a very artificial scent that reminds me of my grandmothers bathroom spray!</li>
    <li> Great detangler, good slip, curls pop, no white residue in hair, its just the smell is a bit much and it last until u wash it out.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the One Condition from this product line. It smells SO good, and I can tell that it really conditions my hair and gives it moisture. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the styling products, but this and the shampoo are winners for me. I also like to put some in a small squirt bottle and add water and spritz it over my hair in the morning to keep it moisturized and tame. Works great!</li>
    <li> This stuff made my scalp itch like what I assume an early onset of lice would be. Furthermore, it wasnt even that moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Great product for my already curly hair  and best price I can find.  I like Deva Curl products a lot!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;If you have curly hair, this shampoo is for you.  It doesn&#x27;t contain harsh ingredience that will damage your sensitive curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love DevaCurl products!! If someone has a negative experience with the WAY these products work, go to a DevaCurl trained stylist who can show you how to use them when he/she cuts your hair.</li>
    <li> This is really helping my hair which is grey and coarse. I actually think the Shampoo is responsible for most of the change in my hair. My hair feels so much better.</li>
    <li> I use this with the Deva Shampoo and it works great.  Not only smells wonderful but helps make my hair soft and keep the big loopy curls from getting frizzy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this for years.  The two that I received before Christmas were definitely watered down.  I just purchased the from another company and the are thicker just the way they should be.</li>
    <li> I did decent research into the product and received mixed reviews. I bought both the shampoo (No-Poo) and this conditioner and have been quite pleased with both. There was several complaints to the smell, but to be honest it&#x27;s not bad, just a heavy \\&quot;natural\\&quot; smell to it and I&#x27;ve even received compliments. For those that have curly hair (mine&#x27;s natural) it&#x27;s been great! My hair seems to be more moisturized, with soft and improved curls. I fully recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this in my birchbox and it is a must for anyone with curly hair. I have been doing the NO POO technique for 5 months. I will never go back to regular shampoo and conditioner again. I have used the Deva shampoo as well but have transitioned to only using the conditioner. Both products are amazing and highly recommend. I have long spiral curls that I have fought with my whole 50 years on this earth and I seriously finally like my curls. It can be pricey but on Amazon it is a great buy. Spend the money and try this. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who has curly hair that can turn into a rats nest in the blink of an eye. I have used it on her hair as a &#x27;co&#x27; wash, and as a leave in de-tangler. Both was are great! Not too heavy or greasy, smells wonderful, I think I&#x27;m going to have to get it by the gallon! Great product.</li>
    <li> If you have curl crazy unmanageable hair try this and all of Deva Curl line, works good! get some today !</li>
    <li> This conditioner was very different from the last one that I bought from Deva Curl. It is very light so I have to use a bit more to keep the same moisture level in my hair. However, it is convenient on the rare occasions that I wash my hair several days in a row because it keeps it from getting too greasy or too dry. Normally I can never condition my hair near the scalp, but this is lightweight enough that I can get away with it on occasion. My only complaint is the smell. It smells a lot like Tide, which I am extremely allergic to and I do have to try to keep it from getting in contact with the skin on my back or neck because it will cause a rash.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! Product! Highly recommend for anyone who wants a product of excellent quality! Thank you so much! Good Job! Congratulations!</li>
    <li> What can I say? AMAZING STUFF! Love this conditioner. Once Condition leaves your curls beautifully smooth and practically frizz free. I randomly decided to buy the shampoo and conditioner because I was pretty much tired of trying product after product that simply just didn&#x27;t produce the results that I wanted. I&#x27;m so glad that I ended up discovering curl deva. I like the fact that I can use a small amount on my hair and I consistently get great results. One Condition isn&#x27;t heavy on your curls and doesn&#x27;t leave ant residue like other brands of curl products do. The way it smell is a bonus as well. I think I&#x27;ve been converted. LOVE CURL DEVA!!</li>
    <li> This product was discovered by accident but it is amazing if you have naturally curly or wavy hair.  It seems a little pricey.  But it lasts a good while as it doesn&#x27;t take much even with long hair.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you want to wear your hair curly. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It works better than most conditioners but I feel like I have to use a lot of the product to cover my whole head (because of the thick consistency). I recommend leaving it in for a few minutes before washing it out to get as much moisture from the product as possible.</li>
    <li> Like another reviewer, I couldn&#x27;t even get my comb through my hair with this \\&quot;conditioner.\\&quot; After using this with the low-poo shampoo, my hair was a dry, frizzy mess and my scalp itched. I didn&#x27;t mind the smell. I didn&#x27;t feel strongly about it one way or another but I can see how it reminds people of men&#x27;s aftershave. Oh how I wish I had never wasted my hard earned money on this product.</li>
    <li> LOVE the Deva line of products!!</li>
    <li> Love the product. My hairdresser recommended it. Smells good and keeps frizz away. Try it you will like it .</li>
    <li> I love  deval one condition. Smells great. I think the price is high for a conditioner . Sauve conditioner works just as well and so much cheaper.</li>
    <li> If I could give it a -(neg) rating, I would.  It&#x27;s awful.  Never again will I buy something I haven&#x27;t already purchased at a salon. After all the great things I&#x27;ve heard about this product, it was really a let down.  Either it was NOT the actual No Poo in the bottle or No Poo is garbage.  I&#x27;ll stick with WEN even tho I liked No Poo&#x27;s PRICE so much better than WEN</li>
    <li> I hate the smell &amp; I&#x27;ve got other conditioners that I like much better. Heck, I&#x27;d use cheap V05 instead of this (which I do love, actually!) This Deva Curl One Conditioner really does nothing impressive for my wavy hair. Won&#x27;t be buying it again. I&#x27;d rather use something else.</li>
    <li> If you have curly dry hair like mine this is a great product.  Been using it for about a year and it works.</li>
    <li> I have been using Deva Curl products for the past  year and love it for my hair. This time I tried to save some money and ordered the One Condition from amazon. Big mistake. The product is definitely fake. It is not the same. I have used the one conditioner for a while I know how it makes my hair feel. This one from amazon made my hair feel rough. Also the neck of the bottle for the Deva conditioner that I buy directly from Devacurl website has some number codes on it. This one from amazon does not have it.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Amazon by email indicating my concern even though I had passed the return timeline as I had some stock and opened this one after finishing the one I had. I must say that Amazon&#x27;s customer service is fabulous. They refunded my entire money for this product and assured me that they will contact the supplier for this stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you amazon. A tip for anyone wanting to buy Devacurl. Please only buy from their authorized dealers. I would not purchase this from anyone else.</li>
    <li> I had very dry unmanageable hair. My hair dresser recommended the Deva Curl One cond. I could not beleive the difference in my hair. I believe this product is for curly hair but mine is blonde and very straight. I love this product. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> My hair is so much softer and more manageable now that I have been using the Deva product line. I love it so much and I try to get everyone who has curly hair to use it. I never loved my hair until I read Curly Girl and started using the product line. Now I&#x27;m so proud of my unique curls. Definitely give it a try and give it a good month or so for your hair to start changing. It doesn&#x27;t happen overnight!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and this condtioner is great.  It smells great and leaves my hair extra smooth.  I notice that I don&#x27;t have to apply alot of gel/mouse to keep the curls bouncy.  I noticed that my hair isn&#x27;t frizzy when I use this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product for my curly hair. This is the only brand I do now.</li>
    <li> I went to the salon and got the trial size and it&#x27;s been doing wonders for my hair so I ordered the full bottle. I never leave my hair curly any more cuase it never does what I want it too but with this product I did and it looked great.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair in the back and straight in the front. I live at the Jersey shore with humidity all the time. This is the only product I use and I&#x27;m glad I found it. It works great for me and tames the frizzies.</li>
    <li> I initially read the book \\&quot;Curly Girl\\&quot; (written by one of the women who developed the Deva Curl products) back in 2005.  I had very long (down to my lower back), curly hair that I hated because it frizzed up all the time and was very unruly.  While the book tweeked my interest about alternative hair care possibilities, I didn&#x27;t change any of my hair care routines until a few months later after I got my hair cut short (above my shoulders).  I LOVED it that way!  I stopped using shampoo altogher and used only conditioners.  Since my scalp is very sensitive I had to use the products that didn&#x27;t make my head break out.  I spent countless dollars trying different products but found none without &#x27;cones (sili&#x27;cones&#x27; weigh hair down and don&#x27;t rinse out well causing build up and droopy hair) that didn&#x27;t work.  Consequently I gave up and settled for whatever didn&#x27;t make my head itch.  Then last fall (2010) the same sister who gave me the \\&quot;Curly Girl\\&quot; book (also a curly girl) led me to the Deva product line.  I was hooked the first time I used it.  These products don&#x27;t make my head itch and my hair looks wonderful!  The One Condition is my favorite because when my hair feels a little dry I use it as a \\&quot;leave in\\&quot; conditioner.  These products are light and bring out my hair&#x27;s natural curl and shine.  I have since decided to grow my hair long again.  Maybe not as long as it was back in 2005, but it is already well below my shoulders and it looks great!</li>
    <li> I love Deva Curl One Condition and have been using it loyally for a year.  I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to pick it up from my salon, and thought I&#x27;d try ordering it through Amazon.  The product I received was the consistency of Half and Half, not the conditioner I know and love.  Clearly, someone (seller: Zulera) is watering this down and selling it to unsuspecting curly girls.  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> However, the bottle I just purchased has thinned out conditioner. It&#x27;s always been nice and thick with past purchases. Disappointed this time.</li>
    <li> If you have dry curly hair this is for you. Love it!</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair use this product, You will never go back to anything else.</li>
    <li> I know this product is supposed to be for people with curly hair, but I just had to give it a try.  I have long, straight caucasian hair.  A hair stylist told a friend of mine with short straight hair that Deva Curl products would make her hair curl.  She tried it and it worked. It gave her waves and body.  So, I had to give it a try.  I have hair where a couple pieces curl in the rain but that&#x27;s about it.  I bought Deva Curl Low Poo, Deva Curl One Conditioner, and Deva Care Arc Angel Gel.  After using the cleanser and conditioner, I dried my hair with a towel and combed it out.  I could see waves starting to happen.  I scrunched it the Arc Angel Gel, and I had waves and body.  I really couldn&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very picky about the conditioner I use.  My favorite is Aveda Damage Remedy Treatment.  I use it every day.  So, I was concerned if Deva Curl One would compare.  To be honest, it&#x27;s not nearly as good as the Aveda, but it still did a nice job.  I use the Aveda for a straight, polished, healthy look.  I&#x27;ll use Deva Curl One when I want the wavy, messy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned that if after using the Deva Curl Low Poo if the conditioner would strip out the effects of the cleanser and I would not see waves/curls and body.  That did not happen.  It seems that the products work together.  I have not tried using any one of them individually to see if I obtain the same results as using them all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the conditioner was very moisturizing and removed my tangles.  I can see how it would be good for curly hair, too.</li>
    <li> This conditioner may not weigh my hair down as much as another condition, so I may order it again.  It has a nice smell and texture.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for people with curly hair.  No frizz only curls.  I use a very small amount every day instead of shampooing every day.  I do not rinse out, just style and go.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I exist on Ramen so that I can buy One Condition, but purchasing it on Amazon helps ease that a little bit.  I paid under $30 here, whereas the cheapest I can get it in town is $42.  I use it every day both in and out of the shower.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my curls down, and after decades of crap hair, I finally have something of which to be proud.  It&#x27;s worth the price, although my friend said she felt like she was rubbing money into her hair.  I&#x27;m comfortable with that feeling, if what I get out of it is awesome curls.</li>
    <li> I havent found any conditioner without silicone that makes my hair easy to comb out after washing, but this one is pretty good .</li>
    <li> This product neither smells nor has the texture of the one I purchased 1 month ago at the Devachan salon.  I believe this is a knock off</li>
    <li> I have short naturally curly hair.  I quite like this conditioner as it is both thin and light while providing ample conditioning.  I have not had good results using it as an after product for control, with or without the Angel Gel.  It does cause your curls to &#x27;behave&#x27; a bit differently and for the most part I like that although I think it might work better on longer hair rather than short.  I find my curls are  more defined and as a result a bit &#x27;heavier&#x27; so overall my hair appears flatter.  I have tried using clips as recommended to lift the curls as they dry but have not had great success in creating more volume.  Once my hair dries I have found it frizzes if you manipulate your hair at all.</li>
    <li> My most favored hair conditioner!</li>
    <li> This product holds my curls tight up until day 3 curls without having to revive it. My curly hair routine is,  cleanse with DevaCurl No poo, condition and wash out with One Condition and style by scrunching dry, reapplying a small amount of one condition and the arc an-gel product. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I love all the Deva Curl products.  This conditioner is silicone and sulfate free, and it works wonderfully for thick curly hair.  I use the Deva Curl ultra defining gel as well, and my hair stays soft and frizz free.  (Also it smells really good!)</li>
    <li> A wonderful conditioner!!!  I will repurchase this forever.  It smells great and my hair  loves it.  Each time I use it, my curls get crisper and tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get lots of shrinkage,  but my curls are defined and moist.</li>
    <li> This conditioner made my skin break out the entire time I used it. I had beautiful curls during the day but my hair looked greasy by nighttime, even though I don&#x27;t have oily hair. To combat the greasy, I wound up having to wash my hair daily even though my Deva stylist said I should only have to do so every 3-4 days. After a month or so of really giving the Deva system a try, I switched back to Aveda products. The whole shampoo/condition/style process was just too time consuming and for all the effort, it didn&#x27;t make my hair look any better.</li>
    <li> I have never had a problem with dry hair despite it being thick and relatively curly. I do not color treat it, I wash only as frequently as needed, and I use leave in conditioners. I started to notice that my hair was more dry within a week of first use, but I assumed that it was just an adjustment to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month, I went to my stylist (5 years - He specializes in curly hair). He touched my hair and exclaimed, \\&quot;What did you do to your hair? Your hair isn&#x27;t dry, your hair is soft, it&#x27;s silky... this is a dry mess.\\&quot; I told him that I had changed to the Deva No Poo Shampoo and Curl One Conditioner. He told me to go home and THROW IT AWAY. I did, bought new products and my hair is back to normal.</li>
    <li> I have Corkicellli curls, and after much research I bought this conditioner for my hair. It smells fantastic, and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too dry like most other conditioners. I also use it as a leav-in but I make sure I put oil in my hair BEFORE I add the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reason for 4 stars is because it didn&#x27;t have a seal; it came in the mail taped at the lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But great stuff!</li>
    <li> This wonderful conditioner is very light and leaves no build up on my fine hair.  Keeps the winter static completely away.</li>
    <li> I use as a leave-in conditioner and my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy.</li>
    <li> I was soooo excited when I ordered these products (Low-poo, conditioner, volumizer, gel) and couldn&#x27;t wait to get them. I have super-curly hair and have battled between fuzzy, puffy hair and total limpness, so I really wanted to try something specifically for curly. I ordered them on Amazon and as soon as they came, I tried them all the first day. The conditioner and volumizer have an AWFUL smell. Honestly, it smelled like I dunked my head in a bucket of Pine-Sol. The strangest part is - the Low-poo and AnGel smelled great... almost a sweet, fruity smell. I am so disgusted by the smell of the conditioner and volumizer, I can&#x27;t even use them. Oh, and since I&#x27;ve opened/used them, I can&#x27;t return them.</li>
    <li> Not a fan.  Didn&#x27;t seem to be as wonderful as all the rave reviews I read about prior to purchasing...might just be how my hair responded (or didn&#x27;t).</li>
    <li> I have used every product imaginable, particularly products designed for black natural hair. That said, this has been the best in terms of keeping my hair soft and not stripped of whatever natural moisturizers of hair. I am a natural who can&#x27;t use oils, shea, aloe, and/or butters. My hair is low porosity. That said, I wash with warm water and use the OneConditioner under a plastic cap or bag. I used the trial size first. It is expensive, but it worth it considering I am a recovering product junkie who spent and wasted so much over the years that I have more than paid for a trip to India and back.</li>
    <li> I love all the deva curl Products!! The shampoo, conditioner and gel!! I have never found something that worked on my dry, very curly hair until now!!!</li>
    <li> i like it a lot, smells nice and fresh, only need small amount, would definately recommend it for just about anyone with curly hair</li>
    <li> Deva Curl One Conditioner is \\&quot;heaven\\&quot; in a bottle!  Great thing is that you can also leave some in your hair as a \\&quot;leave in\\&quot; conditioner!  This according to my hairdresser and guess what it works great.  Manageability in a bottle!</li>
    <li> I had doubts, but I love it! Conditioner has excellent slip and the smell is pleasant, not too strong. I use it more as a leave in conditioner followed by the Arc Angel. Best curls ever!</li>
    <li> works very good on my hair.  it makes my hair smooth and less tangely.  even my husband likes using this conditioner.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time so I do love this.  It&#x27;s the only conditioner I know of that is light enough for my curl.  I have a really light curl and any amount of weight causes them to flatten out pretty quick.  This conditioner is really light and still gives my hair the conditioning that it needs.</li>
    <li> This is my one and only conditioner. I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;It simply melts into my curls leaving them hydrated and soft. I wouldn&#x27;t use any other conditioner. Plus, like many other Devacurl products, it smells AMAZING, but doesn&#x27;t linger if you are scent sensitive. I even use a little as a leave in conditioner.Totally recommend to my curly girls!!</li>
    <li> This is a must have!&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a leave in conditioner too!&lt;br /&gt;It does not leave my hair greasy not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I make sure to rinse in cool water but I do not rinse completely out.</li>
    <li> For a leave in conditioner, it works well, and smells nice.  Leaves hair soft but frizz is not under control, so have to use other products on top as well, which is to be expected.</li>
    <li> This is the only brand of Shampoo/Conditioner that I trust with fantastic results. Keeps my hair nice and clean and it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; which keeps curly hair from getting any more dry than it already is. The nickname &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; alludes to not using a sulfate shampoo, because sulfates tend to strip the hair of its natural oils. Once you take away the sulfates, your hair can retain its natural moisture. Since it&#x27;s all natural, it&#x27;s much better for the hair than regular shampoo/conditoner which has the same active ingredients found in detergents (sulfates). Another added bonus is that it can be used as a leave in as well. Keeps my hair soft, I wont trust anything else. It&#x27;s not cheap, but no salon quality product is. Do yourself a favor, you wont regret it, and you&#x27;ll toss your old shampoo/conditoner and never look back.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is incredible!  I have more wave and curl in my hair than I have ever had.  Everyone thinks I had a perm but it is just natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even put a small amount in a spray bottle, added water and use it as a leave-in conditioner spritz.&lt;br /&gt;The botanicals used in this product give it a very  gentle, soothing, pleasing fragrance.  Not over-powering, and I&lt;br /&gt;am hyper-sensitive to many fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my skin/scalp tolerates this product beautifully.  No rashes or itching from this!</li>
    <li> This conditioner really has saved my curls. Over conditioning with a protein conditioner left my hair very brittle and dry. Now my curls are shiny, beautiful and bouncy and look great even three days later, which is ideal given the price and the size of my budget. Very happy with this product and plan to try others in this line.</li>
    <li> I have been using the DeVa brand for 9 years now. Sometimes I attempt to try a different conditioner or product but ALWAYS come back to this brand.  I have fine curly hair (but a lot of it!).  This conditioner is the only one that doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it greasy.  It smells great too!!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair so much healthier! No more frizz and it smells great. A combination of oils and this shampoo will tame frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I use this after every shampoo and it not only prevents tangels butit smells good too. it is recommended to use with the loo-Poo or No-Poo shampoo</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I feel strongly about this one.  I&#x27;ve been using sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner for years and decided to try this conditioner.  I dislike it intensely.  It did not condition my hair AND smelled awful.  The smell does not rinse out, so my hair is quite stinky hours after washing.  Very disappointed in this product.  Did I receive a knock-off product as others suspect they have?  Not sure.</li>
    <li> I love Deva Curl. Works great on my semi curly hair. Holds curls all day. Does not fell heavy at all.</li>
    <li> Love all the Deva Curl products.  They work so well on my naturally curly hair.  Only a tiny amount does the trick too!</li>
    <li> just the smell alone makes this conditioner a winner. It is pricey but you only need a small amount to get the job done and it is so much healthier for you hair.</li>
    <li> Love Deva Curl products for curly hair.</li>
    <li> I never felt so cheat on a product in my life !!  The conditioner was runny and watered down ! How could you sell your customers something like this ! I shop frequently on amazon until now ! This shopping experience on this product was horrible !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rshick</li>
    <li> I use deva curl products all the time.  all natural and buying is bulk is cheaper than going to Ulta to purchase.</li>
    <li> Pricey for what you get. It&#x27;s much too heavy for my hair (short and fine). I also do not like the smell.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have curly hair, but I still love this conditioner.  It makes my hair look nice and have a lot of body.  It&#x27;s expensive, however, so I use it sparingly.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells a bit like pet shampoo to me, but it&#x27;s easily dealt with. I am not sure if this conditioner is fantastic on its own, but it&#x27;s a great combo with the Diva Curl Shampoos. However, I am not sure the price is worth it.</li>
    <li> I really like this conditioner - it smells great, is not greasy, is light, makes my hear smooth and full at the same time. I recomment it to people with fine hair, like mine. In the summer it makes my hear curly, but summer humidity makes it curly anyways, the conditioner just enhances the curliness.</li>
    <li> a must use for curly hair!  Get on the curly plan and have amazing hair.&lt;br /&gt;been using this for years</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my hairstylist.  Found it on Amazon at a much better price than through the salon.  Has a wonderful clean scent and leaves hair soft.  Not really sure that it does anything better than other products that are out there.</li>
    <li> Great product for curly hair. If you use these product also try some if the other deva curl lines. Helps the curl and controls frizz</li>
    <li> When I first went CG, I started with some drugstore brands of conditioner, because they are cheaper and I was experimenting. Unfortunately, none of them did much for me. They usually resulted in very limp, greasy strings and completely destroyed my curl pattern. Apparently, I needed protein. So I started using this stuff, and, voila, my curls returned. OneCondition is great, because it is not overly moisturizing, and it contains a bit of protein which adds volume to my hair. The slip isn&#x27;t as slick as that of the ultra-moisturizing conditioners, but it suits me well. It really just seems to be a well-balanced conditioner. If you have super dry or super thick hair, this may not be the best choice, but for my fine 3a/3b Botticelli curls it is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s terrific as a co-wash too. I&#x27;ve been using it for months and haven&#x27;t had any build-up or general ickiness on my scalp yet. Despite the price, this one is a keeper!</li>
    <li> This is just ok. I did a review on the wash and I don&#x27;t like either. I spent a lot of money on mediocre products. I would suggest Terressential hair wash. It&#x27;s a wash but it leaves your hair silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I know people always rave about DevaCurl, and I&#x27;m here to tell you there&#x27;s good reason. Honestly, it&#x27;s worth the money. My curls are healthy, happy, and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Love this for my curly hair!  Can&#x27;t wait to get the other two products to complete the line</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff. A little pricey since I have to use it on my daughters curly hair daily but love it.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to see Deva Curl Conditioner for this price, however, after using it I have realized that it&#x27;s absolutely NOT Deva Curl. Some mediocre conditioner in a Deva Curl bottle.</li>
    <li> I was working on growing out my hair and wanted a higher quality conditioner. This makes my hair feel soft, though it seemed to leave a waxy feel after the first few washings. The scent is a bit strong, but I enjoy it. However, if you are sensitive to fragrance, you might want to try something else.</li>
    <li> I bought the low poo, one conditioner, and light defining gel but am really not impressed. I have naturally wavy hair. (Not cork-screw curly or bouncy round curls) The low-poo has a light scent, but this conditioner has a very strong earthy smell to it. Not my favorite. When I use all of the products as described, my hair is just ok, nothing to brag about and a little frizzier than normal, but the next day it is so dried out and straw-like. I thought it was the gel, so I stopped using that but the same results occurred. I&#x27;ve been using these products for about 3 weeks now and just have to give them up. My hair needs moisture and this product seems to suck it dry.  Also, something about the products make my head itchier than normal...just a weird effect I&#x27;ve noticed.  For the price, I am sure there has to be a better product out there. I was really hoping this was it.</li>
    <li> I use this product religiously.  While I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive (college budget is limited) the product does wonder for my hair.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and how soft it leave my curls.  Wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much! Amazon has the best price!</li>
    <li> I heard about this product in the Huffington Post; an article about the of women&#x27;s products.  I have tried it on my straight hair; I did not realize it was designed for curly hair. haha.  My straight hair is damaged from color treatments.  The label suggests to apply a small dab to wet hair and not rise out; this has made a change in my hair for the better.</li>
    <li> I really like Devacurl products. I&#x27;ve stopped purchasing it, however; it&#x27;s just too expensive.</li>
    <li> Love this product line. Makes my wild curls controlled, defined and soft. Curls still look nice after sleeping on them. That&#x27;s never true with any other product.</li>
    <li> Deva Curl has the best products out there by far. This conditioner is very moisturizing and leaves your hair feeling soft and detangles well while in the shower. It also has a nice, clean smell to it. I even put some in a water bottle with water to spray on my second day hair. This has no alcohol, silicones, or sulfates which means you can also use this has a leave-in. Awesome product. I highly recommed it</li>
    <li> I have searched the world over for good shampoo and conditioner for my naturally curly, dry, frizzy hair, and I have finally found it. I love this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year. It leaves hair feeling soft and natural while controlling the curl and there&#x27;s no frizz!</li>
