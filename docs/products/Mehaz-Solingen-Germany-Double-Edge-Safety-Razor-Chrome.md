      <li>Excellent razor, especially given the price point.</li>
      <li>I would give it 5 stars, but the handle and top are not as well balanced as I would like.</li>
      <li>Over the years I switched to the disposables, which have gotten more blades, but also have soared in price.</li>
      <li>it is going to be perhaps the most forgiving safety razor out</li>
      <li>The Mehaz is better however.</li>
      <li>which was pretty good.</li>
      <li>had a better shave with free razors in boot camp.</li>
      <li>Excellent razor, arrived faster than expected.</li>
      <li>A good well made razor at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and control</li>

      <li>Unique shaving experience.  </li>
      <li>All brands of DE blades fit which is cool.</li>
      <li>Mild shave.</li>
      <li>Make sure you buy high quality blades though.</li>
      <li>not at all, it was engineered this way, because most people want/need a forgiving razor and 3 pass shaving is normal for most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great little razor.  </li>
      <li>So far this razor is an outstanding value.  </li>
      <li>And PLEASE - be sure to wrap the old blade in tape before throwing out so</li>
      <li>The razor seems well made, offers a bit tighter, slightly more aggressive shave then the Weishi.</li>
      <li>Well balanced, easy to grip even with wet hands, and the smooth finish on the head glides smoothly over the face.  </li>
      <li>I find the shave to be nearly identical, so bonus points for this one being so easy to load and unload the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The build quality is obvious upon inspection and honestly, far exceeds many razors costing double, triple and even quadruple the price - I know this not because I am guessing, but because I actually own them all and can line them up and take a look, the fit and finish of the Mehaz is superb.&lt;br</li>
      <li>well made, a little light easy to change blades and clean.</li>
      <li>In conclusion I agree with reviewers that recommend this as a first de razor.  </li>
      <li>more passes necessary to achieve a closer shave.</li>
      <li>handle just turn the dial on the handles bottom a bit so the top that holds the blade in place opens and rinse under water for a second to flush the hairs out.</li>
      <li>I used a safety razor years ago, when I first started shaving.  </li>
      <li>I picked this one due to being made in Germany, butterfly design to change blades, got good reviews &amp; it looks high quality.</li>
      <li>So far I like it and alternate between it and the Feather Popular using Feather blades.</li>
      <li>You just have to find the right angle as you shave, not hard to do.</li>
      <li>After achieving my finest DE Razor shave to date, I can confidently recommend this razor to anyone beginning their wet shaving experience.</li>
      <li>and I get a really close shave and</li>
      <li>Plus the blades for this are much cheaper.</li>
      <li>best 20$ i spent seriously.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used as being new too the safty razor vs expensive disposables.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better made than similarly priced razors and more forgiving than the more expensive one you might buy later.</li>
      <li>This is my first twist to open razor.</li>
      <li>OK, no more comparisons--apples and oranges.  </li>
      <li>Then tighten the top back down and continue shaving.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s there to drop your old blades in.</li>
      <li>complaints at all so far apart from needing to improve my technique.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re young you may not know that slot is there for that purpose.</li>
      <li>The mechanism opens smoothly, holds the blade firmly and evenly, and keeps it in place.  </li>
      <li>It just feels natural in my hand.  </li>
      <li>highly, highly recommend this razor to anyone, whether you are new to safety razor shaving or a veteran.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, and for me, the trick was finding the right shaving soap consistency (not too thick, not too bubbly) using Proraso Shaving Soap (the white/grey one) and a fresh Shark blade.</li>
      <li>Using Feather blades, I got a very close smooth shave, with a few minor nicks, with just two passes.</li>
      <li>I also purchased a highly rated Edwin Jagger razor at the same time to compare.  </li>
      <li>This thing just coasts over my face while barely taking anything off.  </li>
      <li>i have very sensitive skin and even with the most expensive disposables i would still get razor bumps and nicks.</li>
      <li>I  get a slightly closer shave with the EJ, but found that I can shave faster with the Mehaz (don&#x27;t have to worry as much about cuts).  </li>
      <li>The only reason to put a new blade in is when the one you have finally dulls over time - and my Personnas double-edge blades (Amazon) LAST.</li>

<li> I bought it for a long train trip thinking it will be easier to deal with rather than having to assemble a three piece razor in a roomette.</li>

<li> Mehaz is not a very aggressive razor, paired with a quality Astra or Personna razor</li>
<li> LIke in the days before disposables this Mehaz uses one blade with two opposing sides (you can use both sides) and when hairs get jammed between the blade and the blade</li>
<li> I like the satin finish although it&#x27;s hard to compare with the deep mirror chrome on a Jagger.  </li>
<li> Some reviewers complained about the short handle, but I&#x27;ve had no problems shaving around the curves of my face.  </li>
<li> Maybe good if you are afraid of cutting yourself</li>

<li> I found I needed a slightly steeper angle during use</li>
<li> Landfills have less plastic and my titanium beard hairs</li>
<li> there - at least that I have used.</li>
<li> I mean for the Gillette Fusion 5 blade Razor-</li>
<li> would get those tough hairs out of the blades.</li>
<li> Package came mangled and poorly packed.  </li>
<li> no one down the line reaches in there for some reason and gets sliced up bad - it happens.</li>
<li> Worst razor purchase I have made.  </li>
<li> Terrible razor.  </li>

    <li> So far I like it and alternate between it and the Feather Popular using Feather blades.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor, arrived faster than expected.</li>
    <li> If you want to reduce getting nicks or in my case razor burn&#x27;s due to dry winter skin then this razor could help, It is well built like my Gillette Fat Boy while giving a close shave with half the aggressiveness. it ended the razor burns for me. i&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This looks like a good copy of the Gillettes I started with. Shaves just like them, too.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Mild shave.</li>
    <li> After achieving my finest DE Razor shave to date, I can confidently recommend this razor to anyone beginning their wet shaving experience. The butterfly mechanism is smooth and holds the blade securely. The handle is well grooved to provide excellent grip and control for a shave in the shower. I have sensitive skin, and for me, the trick was finding the right shaving soap consistency (not too thick, not too bubbly) using Proraso Shaving Soap (the white/grey one) and a fresh Shark blade. Great German engineering and a great price.</li>
    <li> Great little razor.  Not as aggressive as my Edwin Jagger--closer spacing for the blade opening.  I  get a slightly closer shave with the EJ, but found that I can shave faster with the Mehaz (don&#x27;t have to worry as much about cuts).  Great workmanship.  I like the satin finish although it&#x27;s hard to compare with the deep mirror chrome on a Jagger.  OK, no more comparisons--apples and oranges.  Some reviewers complained about the short handle, but I&#x27;ve had no problems shaving around the curves of my face.  It just feels natural in my hand.  In conclusion I agree with reviewers that recommend this as a first de razor.  It&#x27;s better made than similarly priced razors and more forgiving than the more expensive one you might buy later.</li>
    <li> The mechanism opens smoothly, holds the blade firmly and evenly, and keeps it in place.  Well balanced, easy to grip even with wet hands, and the smooth finish on the head glides smoothly over the face.  I also purchased a highly rated Edwin Jagger razor at the same time to compare.  ( http://amzn.com/B00K6Z24SK )  I find the shave to be nearly identical, so bonus points for this one being so easy to load and unload the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints at all so far apart from needing to improve my technique.</li>
    <li> The matte finish looks nice. The knurled handle provides a good grip. This is my first twist to open razor. I bought it for a long train trip thinking it will be easier to deal with rather than having to assemble a three piece razor in a roomette. In that regard the short handle is an asset. The shave compares well with my Futur set at 2.5.</li>
    <li> the razor is very well made and has a nice weight to it. i have very sensitive skin and even with the most expensive disposables i would still get razor bumps and nicks. This is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used as being new too the safty razor vs expensive disposables. i have tried derby,astra,feather blades . feather is by far the sharpest and last the longest hands down. pair this razor with feather blades and u will be amazed the shave is absolutely flawless everytime smooth clean bump free. best 20$ i spent seriously. the only con is the handle it can be just a little longer but you&#x27;ll manage in no time.</li>
    <li> well made, a little light easy to change blades and clean. finish is good</li>
    <li> Excellent economy razor. Make sure you buy high quality blades though. Drugstore blades don&#x27;t cut it.</li>
    <li> great razor.  the ones that cost twice as much are no better. and none of them are butterfly style AND short handle.</li>
    <li> I own and use a variety of safety razors including the top model Merkur&#x27;s and classic Gillette&#x27;s and I have to say, the Mehaz is an excellent quality safety razor by any measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is obvious upon inspection and honestly, far exceeds many razors costing double, triple and even quadruple the price - I know this not because I am guessing, but because I actually own them all and can line them up and take a look, the fit and finish of the Mehaz is superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mehaz is not a very aggressive razor, paired with a quality Astra or Personna razor it is going to be perhaps the most forgiving safety razor out there - at least that I have used. Having said that, some will not like its forgiveness because that lack of aggression means (for those like me) more passes necessary to achieve a closer shave. Does this translate into a problem? not at all, it was engineered this way, because most people want/need a forgiving razor and 3 pass shaving is normal for most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly, highly recommend this razor to anyone, whether you are new to safety razor shaving or a veteran. I will be buying several as a stocking stuffer for friends during the holidays.</li>
    <li> I was told to give double edge shave a try.  I use shave oil, make it myself but it would clog my triple edge razors, so I bought two. One for me and one for my son who also loves the shave oil but had a similar problem with his triple edge.  These work great - I was originally I was concerned that it would be difficult to learn to use, it was a piece of cake.  and I get a really close shave and the blade easily rinses clean.  The blades I bought a box of 100 for $11 and they last for 3-4 days.  That is $11/year.  I would give it 5 stars, but the handle and top are not as well balanced as I would like. Still a great razor.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a DE razor. I picked this one due to being made in Germany, butterfly design to change blades, got good reviews &amp; it looks high quality. I&#x27;ve used this several times with shaving gel. It doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to and shaves closer than the drug store multi blades. Plus the blades for this are much cheaper. All brands of DE blades fit which is cool. You just have to find the right angle as you shave, not hard to do.</li>
    <li> All shaving problems solved with this. Mucho dinero saved each year. Landfills have less plastic and my titanium beard hairs no longer jam between multi-blades making the blades unable to cut more beard. No joke - because of that problem I could only get maybe 2 shaves out of a multi blade and nothing (I tried EVERYTHING) would get those tough hairs out of the blades. Their spring-action strength seemed to fuse them to the blades. LIke in the days before disposables this Mehaz uses one blade with two opposing sides (you can use both sides) and when hairs get jammed between the blade and the blade handle just turn the dial on the handles bottom a bit so the top that holds the blade in place opens and rinse under water for a second to flush the hairs out. Then tighten the top back down and continue shaving. The only reason to put a new blade in is when the one you have finally dulls over time - and my Personnas double-edge blades (Amazon) LAST. And PLEASE - be sure to wrap the old blade in tape before throwing out so no one down the line reaches in there for some reason and gets sliced up bad - it happens. Or if your medicine cabinet as that slot in the back inside that&#x27;s there to drop your old blades in. If you&#x27;re young you may not know that slot is there for that purpose.</li>
    <li> Nice weight. Easy to use and control</li>
    <li> I wanted to give a butterfly razor a try after using a Merkur.  So far this razor is an outstanding value.  I found I needed a slightly steeper angle during use, however, it is very smooth and gives a wonderfully clean/close shave.  Great grip on the handle, solid feel in the hand.  Excellent razor, especially given the price point.</li>
    <li> Terrible razor.  Maybe good if you are afraid of cutting yourself but I get bored trying to shave with this and go back to real razor.  This thing just coasts over my face while barely taking anything off.  Worst razor purchase I have made.  Package came mangled and poorly packed.  Bummed at loosing the money on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a better shave with free razors in boot camp.</li>
    <li> Received this item promptly from seller. I used a safety razor years ago, when I first started shaving.  Over the years I switched to the disposables, which have gotten more blades, but also have soared in price. I mean for the Gillette Fusion 5 blade Razor- this costs well  $25.00. I bought the Weishi Safety Razor here recently- which was pretty good. The Mehaz is better however. Using Feather blades, I got a very close smooth shave, with a few minor nicks, with just two passes. I am still in the process of learning the angles and tricks to using a safety razor again. The razor seems well made, offers a bit tighter, slightly more aggressive shave then the Weishi. For best results use shaving soap, and a brush. Prep with a non soap cleanser before hand. A great starter razor for those wanting to move beyond a multi blade disposable.</li>
    <li> Excellent razor  Hard-to-find blades readily available at stores but many on line. Unique shaving experience.  Used one when I was much younger</li>
    <li> A good well made razor at a reasonable price.</li>
