<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> There are no \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; hair products out there, but this is honestly one of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve found which does really help naturally invigorate my thinning hair. The shampoo makes my hair look fuller and the conditioning element makes it feel natural. It is perfect for daily use without leaving your hair dry or feeling synthetic. I alternate with Nioxin to keep my hair and scalp stimulated and I&#x27;ve found both products work well together.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used like 7 thousand dollars of hair growth/hair loss products over the past decade. Check out my story on HairLossFromSteroids.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tricomin is the VERY BEST shampoo if you want your hair appear as thick as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great if you have thin or thinning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a \\&quot;hair loss\\&quot; shampoo that stops hair loss - check out my site if you want my recommendations for that. Nor it&#x27;s a \\&quot;hair growth\\&quot; shampoo that has hair growth compounds such as biotin, niacin, aloe, etc. or that promotes an \\&quot;ideal hair growth environment\\&quot;. It&#x27;s simply an aesthetic shampoo that works great. It&#x27;s better than Nioxin, but it&#x27;s more expensive. A lot of the very best hair restoration surgeons carry and recommend Tricomin, that&#x27;s how I found it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I have only been using this shampoo for about 1 month.  All the reviews that I read online about this product from various websites were negative but a new dematologist that I met with suggested that i try it since finasteride alone wasn&#x27;t working.  So far, this shampoo has done nothing for me but give me really flat, almost sticky hair.  It&#x27;s supposed to be conditioning shampoo but they definitely left the conditioner out!  I am still losing the same amount of hairs everyday and still have the same amount of scalp itch.  It has a medicine smell which doesn&#x27;t really bother me but many people have been complaining about it.  My suggestion, save your money!</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo and conditioner all in one for thicker and fuller hair. It gives my hair a nice full look right after coming out of the shower. My favorite shampoo and Ive tried them all.</li>
    <li> This is one of the better shampoos that I have used. What I love most about it is that it&#x27;s a shampoo and conditioner all in one so I saved time and money by using it. My hair feels and looks fuller as well as being more manageable since I started using this shampoo and conditioner all in one.</li>
    <li> The shampoo/condition  is a good product and work great on hair damage,but the bottle is too small, I give them 5 stars</li>
    <li> not sure if it really worked but it didn&#x27;t hurt</li>
    <li> I am convinced that the claims made by the manufacturer have merit based on my personal experience and the science behind it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for only 3 weeks, having previously used several other products who also work, this is my favorite, shampoo and conditioner in one and just a little makes a lot of foam, smells great too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for 5+ years and it keeps hair from falling out.  It doesn&#x27;t regrow hair but it really helps with further hair loss.  Great product &amp; recommended!</li>
    <li> Great product and service</li>
    <li> Companion to the follicle therapy. Good job shampooing, hair/scalp feels clean, add the follicle spray, rogaine and hopefully your remaining hair will last.</li>
    <li> It does work. Slowly but surely... I was on the hairloss track that my brother had and started to get worried. I watched my hair start to receed in the front as weeks went by. I tried this stuff and for the first month or so it continued to receed. After that it just stopped and the only time I even think about it anymore is when I have to order a new bottle. Over 3-4 months I haven&#x27;t noticed too much extra growth but stopping the loss is a good start.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a difference</li>
    <li> its hard to describe how good this is. i mean its an expensive volumizer but i&#x27;ve never used other volumizers so i can&#x27;t compare it with anything else. this does not treat or stop dht from building on the scalp topically. it leaves the hair nice and fluffy</li>
    <li> Really does what it claims. From 1st apply it leaves your hair feeling and looking fuller , more manageable, healthier and thicker.&lt;br /&gt;Contains copper peptides which appear to be an excelent ingredient for hair loss and  thinning . Really liked it .</li>
    <li> I have used this product for past 3 years and am well pleased with the results, it has kept my hair healthy!!!</li>
