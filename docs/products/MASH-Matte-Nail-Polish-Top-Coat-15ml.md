      <li>This is something worth buying n adding to your collection</li>

      <li>I love the matte nail look, but frankly, it&#x27;s not worth me not being able to touch anything for an hour for fear of smudging my manicure.</li>
      <li>I was not able to find any brand of matte top coat in a few local stores, so I was happy to find this one online, and the price was nice too!</li>
      <li>i was happy to find the MASH Matte Nail Polish Top Coat 15ml for the price (which is a bit expensive for nailpolish, but offordable.)</li>

      <li>Personally, I think the effect is satisfying.</li>
      <li>The matte look is interesting and it&#x27;s definitely different.</li>
      <li>I tried it out first thing.</li>
      <li>I was worried that I would have to spend more money on the same colors I already but in matte.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what you&#x27;d expect it to, and it does it well.</li>

      <li>&lt;br /&gt;It dries really fast and doesn&#x27;t chip at all!</li>
      <li>Bought this on a whim and only used it once but seems to be okay.  </li>
      <li>The others just looked like I used a regular shine top coat....</li>
      <li>For solid colors, though, you gain a versatile new look by using this top coat.  </li>
      <li>it dries fast; I only needed one coating and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
      <li>over pink and over black... looks good!</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re okay with the short lasting effect, then the price is definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t think it really works.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Everything my daughter wanted</li>
    <li> The matte look is interesting and it&#x27;s definitely different. This nail polish does what it is supposed to do. I wished it dried faster, but oh well...</li>
    <li> I have to say that this is my first matte product, but I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with it! It works just how it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying a matte nail polish and I love it! I have a lot of different colored nail polish n I was worried that I would have to spend more money on the same colors I already but in matte. It goes great on all of my regular polishes and leaves a great matte finish. This is something worth buying n adding to your collection</li>
    <li> It works it modes what they say makes nails matte drys quickly. I recommend this polish. Nice and looks good over black polish.</li>
    <li> dries really quick&lt;br /&gt;makes  the color totally matte</li>
    <li> I love the stuff, but I only got about a third of the way through the bottle before it had dried out into an unusable state inside it. I sealed it tightly but it still dried out when not being used, over the course of about a week.</li>
    <li> Not much of a matte finish. It just looks makes the polish look somewhat dull. Not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> First time i got this item i was very disappointed, because it was expired and looked more like sticky glue thats almost dried out. Then i contacted seller and they sent me a brand new nail polish. I like it. Its perfect for mens manicure or if u need to get a100% matte look on your nails. Will definitely buy it again</li>
    <li> We don&#x27;t get this type of nail polish here in the Caribbean so it&#x27;s really nice and premium for our tastes. Came as advertised as well.</li>
    <li> I just got my polish today. It came a day earlier than expected, so yay for that! I tried it out first thing. I&#x27;m a wee bit disappointed. The polish really sucks out the luster of my normal polishes well, however not well enough. I polished my nails with black polish and cover it with the matte. I put small black dots on top and you can hardly see the difference. My nails just look black like normal :/. Which sucks because I was hoping for a killer design. Over the product is okay but may not the best.</li>
    <li> The polish shipped in a few days and worked just as I expected it too. As soon as you apply it, it begins to dry in the matte finish and looks great on most of the colors I have used it with I like applying it to black polish the best!!! Worth every cent!!!</li>
    <li> Nails have to be 100% dry for the matte effect to take effect and even then it&#x27;s for only a short time. Other than that, worked great!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if its THIS brand in particular, or all matte topcoats, but this stuff literally takes like 15 minutes to even begin to dry. It&#x27;s horrible. I love the matte nail look, but frankly, it&#x27;s not worth me not being able to touch anything for an hour for fear of smudging my manicure. Other than that, it&#x27;s swell.</li>
    <li> So far it seems to be doing its job. Received it on time. Hope it continues to work as it is promised.</li>
    <li> It was everything my daughter excepted she&#x27;s happy so I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> I love this, I use it all the time on my nails (:&lt;br /&gt;It dries really fast and doesn&#x27;t chip at all!</li>
    <li> Love it so much&lt;br /&gt;Last a long time !&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!!! Beautiful with every color&lt;br /&gt;Not pricey  I ordered a few more</li>
    <li> Great product and great delivery.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. It does exactly what it says it&#x27;s going to do. I applied it over a regular shiny nail polish and the shine went away. It turned dull and matte. I was also happy that the color of my nail polish came through, only because this top coat has a bit of a color like a milky white and it is also fast drying just as stated. Awesome! Awesome!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work with any nail polish that has a shimmer or glitter to it. It also doesn&#x27;t truly make it a matte look, it&#x27;s more dull and just not the same. Save your money and buy true matte polish if you want that look.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will and it dried fairly quickly. I have not really had a chance to play like I want to, but over pink and over black... looks good!</li>
    <li> Bought this on a whim and only used it once but seems to be okay.  Nothing good or bad to say about it</li>
    <li> Works great.... I&#x27;ve tried it with every single color of nail polish I have and it&#x27;s great! I would recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. It makes it so easy to create that matte effect without having to spend a ton of money on new nail polishes that are matte.&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note though is that it does shine up a little bit with wear, but i think applying lotions and other things like that are what effect that.</li>
    <li> i love the effect this makes on black nail polish, it&#x27;s just gorgeous and it also arrived very quickly! will be buying more again!</li>
    <li> It works really well, the only problem is after a few days the shine starts to come back again so adding a new coat every few days should prevent that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once but it works well. It does what it says! Easy to use. Bought one for my mom too, hope she likes it.</li>
    <li> I gave this product only 4 stars because it was a week late and the seller was no help when I sent a message about it being so late. The product its self is great. I have a grey on my toes right now and it did exactly what it should an made it lusterless! I read other reviews that commented on it not working well with black or shimmery polish so I decided to do a black shimmery polish on my finger nails (OPI My private jet is the color) and it worked great. I am not sure why other reviewers said it did not work, but mine did.</li>
    <li> This stuff is weird!  I used it on all ten fingers, and three had a matte finish.  The others just looked like I used a regular shine top coat.... the exact opposite of what should have happened.  I shook it and everything... not sure what the problem was?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it on for over a week, and I&#x27;ve noticed that my nails are shiny again&lt;br /&gt;it looks nice, and it lasted for a little less than a week</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all! So disappointed sorry</li>
    <li> it looks nice but after a couple days the shine of the nail polish comes back and i have to cover it with a new coat.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product. My daughter has been doing beautiful nails by hand. Geisha girls snowmen stars.  This has been her dream item to copy some of the looks on top salons.  Now she can. Excellent choice</li>
    <li> After Essie discontinued their matte top coat, I amazon searched another brand.  I LOVE this MASH product.  It&#x27;s great over other colors or even a fun texture for plain nails.  Quick shipment too!  And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> got it pretty quick, great price no shipping does what its supposed to &amp; my pedi hasn&#x27;t cracked &amp; I did it over 5 days ago! so I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s good!!</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t think it really works. I was hoping for more of a drastic matte look to contrast my tips. i was trying to do a matte french manicure. where you take a dark color- keep the tips glossy and matte the rest of the nail. I will try again, i haven&#x27;t given up hope.</li>
    <li> I assume the matte aspect rubs off with oil because I have very oily skin and touch my face a lot.&lt;br /&gt;On the plus, this polish dries very fast and I&#x27;m not kidding, it is absolutely what I thought it would be. PERFECT. It looks best on black ;D it is not shiny. but the tips might start to gradually get shinier if you touch your skin a lot.</li>
    <li> Decent price, getting a top coat is better because it can be used with any colour rather than buying matte black and red and...</li>
    <li> I read the reviews, I ordered it, and I love it. It does exactly what you&#x27;d expect it to, and it does it well.</li>
    <li> It will make the nail matte but it create a white residue when it gets in contact with soap/water. It does this when I wash my hands, shower, and wash dishes.</li>
    <li> The product took a bit longer to dry than i thought but it was worth it the finish looks awesome.</li>
    <li> This top coat provides a great way to change up the look of polishes you already own without having to buy specific matte colors. It goes on smoothly and dries pretty fast, and looks great alone or with a combination of matte/shiny on the nail. Personally, I think the effect is satisfying. I&#x27;m baffled as to why someone would want to place this over a glitter or shimmer polish and complain about the result....glitter and shimmer, by definition, imply shiny and need to stay that way.  For solid colors, though, you gain a versatile new look by using this top coat.  I was not able to find any brand of matte top coat in a few local stores, so I was happy to find this one online, and the price was nice too!</li>
    <li> MASH matte top coat transforms a shiny nail polish finish to a smoothe matte/satin look. It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t turn chalky like some similar matte polishes. I would definitely recommend this if you want to change up the look of your polish.</li>
    <li> It gave me the matte finish I was looking for. Not sure if it changes the color yet because I&#x27;ve only done it on my black nail polish, but I love it. Can&#x27;t wait to try out other colors.</li>
    <li> Great for protecting your nails with this top mate coat. Love the look and a clean groomed man always stands out.</li>
    <li> works perfectly on any nail polish.  it&#x27;s a great product to have instead of having to buy a series of matte nail polishes</li>
    <li> It did just what I was looking for! I loved it! This polish makes a perfect matte over most other polishes.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because this product is amazing. Origanally i wanted to purchase the elf matte nail polish top coat which was $2.00 but they were out of it and anyway the shipping was $7.00 which is quiet crazy! i was happy to find the MASH Matte Nail Polish Top Coat 15ml for the price (which is a bit expensive for nailpolish, but offordable.) The price might have not been the best but FREE SHIPPING is a YES! BUY THIS PRODUCT ITS AMAZINGGG!!!</li>
    <li> Came really fast in good packageing&lt;br /&gt;I personally love it&lt;br /&gt;So far it works on any polish&lt;br /&gt;Great if you love the matte look</li>
    <li> I like the product alright I guess. It does give you a matte finish, but in about three days some of it starts to &amp;#34;buff&amp;#34; off. It becomes shiny again. But the price of it was nice so I will keep using it but I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d repurchase this brand of matte polish.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do...creates a matte look. And it&#x27;s inexpensive, too.</li>
    <li> this matte nail polish does the job. it made my nail color look more interesting!! the only thing is..it s not a long lasting coat. in a couple day the matte color start to fade and show the shinny color under it.</li>
    <li> I have this for 2 months and its not even half the bottle yet. Waiting time of arrival is 10-14 days which is ok if you&#x27;re not on a rush to have it and besides, ITS FREE SHIPPING! Applying is super easy coz it dries fast; I only needed one coating and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. I gave it a 4 coz the matte effect disappears after 3-4 days so you might want to re apply another coat of the product.  Over all, this product works great especially for beginners who want to try the matte effect on their nails. If you&#x27;re skeptical, I was too before. Believe me its worth it!! :)</li>
    <li> Good price. Does make nail polish matte but it doesn&#x27;t prevent chipping as well as a regular topcoat. Sometimes it peels off easily</li>
    <li> Makes any shiny nail color into matte with one coat. Looks great.</li>
    <li> I got this because I really like the Matte look, but don&#x27;t feel like buying a bunch of different nail polishes. I put this on over my regular color, it looks great!! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> The company ship the item quite fast but the product itself needs multiple coats to give the full effect. Please let it dry for at least 10 minutes between coats. Also, if you&#x27;re ordering the product on a friday mid afternoon, be aware that the company will process the order monday afternoon.</li>
    <li> This top coat is much cheaper than the usual ones but (on me at least) even with a thick coat, the matte aspect only lasts a day or so. Unless you never wash your hands I guess...&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re okay with the short lasting effect, then the price is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Super cute and does what it says! Never used matte nail polish before but this one is most excellent and priced just right!</li>
