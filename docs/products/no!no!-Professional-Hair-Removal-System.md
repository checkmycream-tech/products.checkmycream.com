### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Until then I&#x27;m very happy with its immediate hair removal capabilities.   </li>
      <li>/&gt;Without a doubt, this is the best hair remover product that I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
      <li>no! works very good on them.  </li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>it will fly off of the shelves at that price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s for everyone, but for me, using it this was was great.</li>
      <li>The posts who are happy with it seem to see a difference at 3 months, so I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been great.</li>
      <li>I own this and was very impressed by the results.</li>
      <li>-It works best on fine hair, like the hair around my thighs.</li>
      <li>I think the product is fair, because I will have saved money compared to laser hair removal for my arms and underarms.  </li>
      <li>It is way cheaper than laser treatments, and sure I could be more impressed</li>
      <li>It is way cheaper than laser treatments, and sure I could be more impressed</li>
      <li>-The blades appear to burn out easily, but then I realized they work better on longer hair (1/4 inch is best) than they do on stubble.</li>
      <li>It does not work better than shaving (legs not as smooth- even after you buff them!!!)</li>
      <li>I was very excited to get No!No!</li>
      <li>Nice.    </li>
      <li>I was expecting more since I heard so many great things about this product.</li>
      <li>The unit is supposed to turn itself off if it gets to warm but just going over my arms</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why I can tolerate that kind of pain</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great tool for the right application.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair (a waxers dream) and this product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>It seems to be working, I use it most on my arms</li>
      <li>The newer they are, the better they work...</li>
      <li>And these ain&#x27;t cheap!</li>
      <li>-I was so pleased with my bikini line I&#x27;ve begun using it on my belly, for that medium-density peach fuzz.</li>
      <li>you have to expect 2 more life cycles.</li>
      <li>However, I will keep trying it to see if the hair becomes more sparse over time.</li>
      <li>Like I said, time consuming - which would be OK if it worked well</li>
      <li>so im giving it more time.</li>
      <li>in all, I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
      <li>And these ain&#x27;t cheap!</li>
      <li>in Germany my parents&#x27; motto always was that \\&quot;Nothing worthwhile happens</li>
      <li>the more</li>
      <li>In fact most of the hair on my shins and calves no longer grows at all.  </li>
      <li>It seems to be working, I use it most on my arms</li>
      <li>every week for the rest of my life, it does a better job than ANY waxing, shaving, etc.</li>
      <li>The best results I saw were on my arms, which is about the same as 3-4 days of growth on my legs.  </li>
      <li>I saw better results with just the wire.  </li>
      <li>I will try it faithfully until the 60 day trial is up then probably return it, if I don&#x27;t get better results.  </li>
      <li>I keep using it thinking surely it will work one day, ha, ha.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m using it more</li>
      <li>Let me be more specific about its attributes and what (I feel) it does best:  </li>
      <li>easy to master, the hair comes off in seconds, and it&#x27;s enjoyable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am very fair skinned with medium toned hair (body &amp; head) and I was discouraged after reading all the \\&quot;it doesn&#x27;t work - especially if you&#x27;re fair\\&quot; hype on Amazon &amp; HSN.</li>
      <li>but there&#x27;s no thrill of yanking a cloth from your legs only to find that the hairs are still nicely in tack and that you have successfully removed about 2 or 3 layers of skin instead.</li>
      <li>Do not buy this if you have blond hair that is easy to shave.</li>
      <li>Gosh, it bugs me when people keep falling into the \\&quot;quick and easy\\&quot; boobie trap!  </li>
      <li>and I notice a huge difference.</li>
      <li>and I notice a huge difference.</li>
      <li>I practiced on my arms until I got the hang of it, and my arms look fantastic.</li>
      <li>Smooth like I used a razor, but not irritated, and it doesn&#x27;t LOOK like I took a razor to my stomach.</li>
      <li>I even forgot to repeat two to three times in that week because my legs were still smooth.</li>
      <li>It takes 30-45  minutes each session, and I never have smooth skin.  </li>
      <li>However, it does not leave my skin smooth.  </li>
      <li>just light a scented candle while you use it.</li>
      <li>This product works best for people who have to shave everyday, and want a reduction.  </li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>its a good product, i like that its pretty much painless, no wax!</li>
      <li>really!!!</li>
      <li>Other wise this no!no!</li>
      <li>I was excited when I ordered this product.</li>
      <li>Worth it if you are patient.suprise!</li>
      <li>If you are interested in more details on the product and how it works you can check out my blog at [...]</li>
      <li>I have had pretty good results so far with the no!no!  </li>
      <li>they came right off!</li>
      <li>and after just one use it removed the hair on my lower legs for a full week.</li>
      <li>And the smell is not bad at all.</li>
      <li>I have had this product for 2 months and it has done a great job, I have relatively coarse hair and am using this on a small area but it has worked great.</li>
      <li>Must everything be \\&quot;quick and easy\\</li>
      <li>Lucky girls that say it works for them.  </li>
      <li>I think I went over the same area too many times, and the results are not as outstanding as they were on my legs</li>
      <li>but after a few months I am seeing results, so I am happy.  </li>
      <li>Worth the price for no in-grown hairs.</li>
      <li>I liked the results enough that I am buying another unit</li>
      <li>no today, I have used it on my husband&#x27;s back, and my own legs.</li>
      <li>All in all, while steep at $250, it&#x27;s still cheaper than a year&#x27;s worth of leg waxing</li>
      <li>Worth it if you are patient.</li>
      <li>yet I&#x27;m hoping for the best but still no great results.</li>
      <li>but I think it is worth the effort for now.  </li>
      <li>However, my experience has still been very positive.  </li>
      <li>It will work over time and that says and achives more then most any other product out there.</li>
      <li>So basically you spend more time removing the hair &amp; it grows back just as quick.</li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it&#x27;s certainly not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>However if you are willing to put in the time, then it is soo worth it.</li>
      <li>Honestly I didn&#x27;t buy it for its long term claims.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very slow, yes, but I have experienced significant hair reduction.</li>
      <li>I use it on my arms, which have fine hair and it does a good job of removing it quickly and it seems that the hair is growing back slower and less dense.  </li>
      <li>You really have to be committed to doing it!</li>
      <li>It worked okay on my husband&#x27;s back, had to trim the hair shorter for quicker/better results.</li>
      <li>;)    </li>
      <li>At first I tried to do it like 1 to 2 times a week</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cut back on my need to shave about 60% and seems to be getting more.</li>
      <li>Above that, the hair is growing in so sparsely that I don&#x27;t even bother shaving it more than once a month.</li>
      <li>you have to do it consistently though which can be a pain.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty fool-proof.</li>
      <li>FYI, I&#x27;m going to my first electrolysis appt tomorrow.  </li>
      <li>On the upside, I had no pain with it ;)  </li>
      <li>do it to improve US/Israel relations. ;)</li>
      <li>you feel it getting hot.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The negative reviews are valid, but so are the positive reviews. Here is my positive review.    I bought this for one reason: to conquer my bikini line. I can&#x27;t shave (or wax) that area without getting serious ingrown hairs which leave scars. One day I hope to afford laser hair removal, but until then, the No!No! satisfies me. The very first time I used it, it visibly removed the hair, but I could still feel it slightly with my hand. However, this is EXACTLY what I wanted--a device that I could use so I can wear a swimsuit without shame, but which doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or produce scarring bumps. I&#x27;m not an idiot, so I didn&#x27;t expect miracles. Hoorah!     Let me be more specific about its attributes and what (I feel) it does best:  -It works best on fine hair, like the hair around my thighs. I practiced on my arms until I got the hang of it, and my arms look fantastic. When I was younger I shaved my arms but stopped once I realized it looked obvious.   -It also works better on longer hair, though the smell is worse. I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of reviews about the smell. It is an odd smell, but it&#x27;s temporary and minor, but that&#x27;s how I know it&#x27;s working. It burns your hair, folks.    -The blades appear to burn out easily, but then I realized they work better on longer hair (1/4 inch is best) than they do on stubble. I have had no problem ordering replacement blades. You buy them from the same amazon page as you buy the No!no!. Instead of choosing a color, choose the accessory pack.  Haven&#x27;t had to use them yet, but I like to be prepared.   -It does not cause razor burn or ingrown hairs, however you can burn yourself if you&#x27;re not careful. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t really hurt, and goes away in a day. In general it&#x27;s very gentle.   -I was so pleased with my bikini line I&#x27;ve begun using it on my belly, for that medium-density peach fuzz. It&#x27;s been great. Smooth like I used a razor, but not irritated, and it doesn&#x27;t LOOK like I took a razor to my stomach. The hair grows back slowly over afew days.   -I have only had it a month, so I cannot say how it works in the long term. But because of the way it removes the hair (burning it instead of cutting it) the hair grows back in a softer way, so it feels less prickly and bristly, and less dense.  I started using it in February so that if it does reduce the hair permanently, I&#x27;ll be ready by summer. Honestly I didn&#x27;t buy it for its long term claims. I&#x27;ll believe it when I see it. Until then I&#x27;m very happy with its immediate hair removal capabilities.   -It is not worth the full price, but it was worth the sale price. That is key for me.     Like anything else, what works for one person won&#x27;t work for everyone. If you are plagued by a sensitive bikini line, or you&#x27;re looking for something to remove irritating fuzz, or to smooth out your arms/stomach/lower back without looking obvious, in the privacy of your home, painlessly, this is it.  Get it at the lower price so you don&#x27;t feel ripped off when it doesn&#x27;t turn out to be the holy grail. It&#x27;s a great tool for the right application.</li>
    <li> A waste of money, does not do what it claims, YEs it burns the hair, but not below the surface. LEaves a weird sensation on the skin after and does not remove the hair adequatly.</li>
    <li> Its my 3rd use of the machine its true its painless, althought I burned myself 2 times, it burns de hair but not from the root so its not a clean shave, Its supposed to take a while to see real results on hair density, I havent stared on my bikini area yet I&#x27;m hoping for the best but still no great results. It saids that you need time so im giving it more time. for now its no great thing.</li>
    <li> I purchased the no!no! b/c I am tired of shaving all the time! I am very fair skinned with medium toned hair (body &amp; head) and I was discouraged after reading all the \\&quot;it doesn&#x27;t work - especially if you&#x27;re fair\\&quot; hype on Amazon &amp; HSN. But I decided to give it a try &amp; just return it if I didn&#x27;t like it. I&#x27;ve only had the no! no! for about a month, but I definitely see a difference! And the smell is not bad at all. I lit a fragrant candle while I no!no!&#x27;d and I had no lingering smell. Took about 10 minutes the first time to get the hang of s-l-o-w-l-y gliding the machine up my leg, but once I did, I only had to spend about 15 mins on each leg - and I mean the whole leg (ankle to thigh). I used the no!no! 2-3X a week for the first 3 weeks and now I feel that I can cut back to 1-2X a week. The hair is definitely sparser - no question. And I didn&#x27;t burn myself at all - I don&#x27;t understand how anyone who read and followed the directions could burn themselves!!!    I wish the manufacturer would come up with a face version for chin hair, but oh well...guess I&#x27;ll have to get those pesky buggers lasered instead. All in all, while steep at $250, it&#x27;s still cheaper than a year&#x27;s worth of leg waxing and I can do it whenever I want! I recommend the no!no! very highly.</li>
    <li> I was convinced by a sales woman at Sephora that this was an amazing-non scarring hair removal tool that would remove hair forever.   At the time it was $199 - on sale.  This was So not the case, I used it 3 days a week for 2 months and then gradually used it only once in a while until finally giving up on it.    There was absolutely NO change in the hair I had used it on, I thought \\&quot;I&#x27;ll just keep using it, it&#x27;s bound to eventually thin it out somewhat\\&quot; but I never saw any change.    It takes forever to remove any hair, it takes 6-8 passes to remove a 1 inch area of hair and it does it by using a thin hot wire to burn the hair off of your leg.    Save your money, buy a new razor.</li>
    <li> GARBAGE.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t kept it longer than Sephora&#x27;s 30 day returns.    On the box, it says that it is science, not magic, and that it takes time and patience.  So, I thought it was just me that was the problem.  Turns out the \\&quot;science\\&quot; as explained on the video is that they think the heat might interfere with \\&quot;communication.\\&quot;  Maybe.  Nice.    This product is so bad that it actually makes me never want to buy anything at Sephora again. I can&#x27;t believe that this piece of garbage would fool their buyers.  Especially at its insane original price point.    You always smell like burnt hair because, guess what, you still have burnt hair on you.  It takes forever.  I could deal with that if it worked, but it just doesn&#x27;t.  I wanted it to work, believe me, but it doesn&#x27;t.  Take your money to a real laser treatment or just wax.</li>
    <li> The problems that I found with this product are:  -The smell of burning hair is horrible.  -It actually cut some parts of my body while using it and created wounds.  -I had to go over the hair numerous times over and over again to cut it.  -The hair grew back the same despite  using it for over 5 months.  -Its hard to get the replacement blades.  Had to order them through ebay as Sephora was sold out everywhere.  Overall, a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have owned the No-No for about 9 months and have continued to try to make it work.   I have used it 1-2 times per week the whole time.  And guess what.  I still need to use it that much.  I have seen no reduction in hair count and the hair looks exactly the same as it did with shaving.  The buffing pad does just as well by itself in removing hair.  Save your money and just buy the buffing pads.  You can get them at Wal-Mart for a song.  This product is a total rip off.</li>
    <li> Most of the negative reviewers here simply did not use no!no! long enough. I have really, really coarse, dark, thick hair on my legs (or I used to, anyway)! I have been using no!no! for just over 3 months now and have noticed a HUGE reduction in the number of hairs that grow back. This is what the product is supposed to do, ladies. It&#x27;s not supposed to make the hair grow back more slowly or grow back in thinner, it&#x27;s supposed to make less hairs grow back period (where you had 100 hairs before, maybe only 50 come back). It is time consuming, especially in the first weeks of treatment, and if you *read* on Sephora, they mention that especially in your first weeks, you will probably still need to shave the stubble to get yourself really smooth. However, after 3 months, I am only having to shave the 4\\&quot; or so of leg right above my ankle. Above that, the hair is growing in so sparsely that I don&#x27;t even bother shaving it more than once a month. I maybe have 4-6 hairs that have grown back per square inch above that line, and I can definitely tell it is reducing the number of hair below the line, closer to the ankle (I guess it was more dense down there to begin with). I am also so, so pleased that it is gentle on the skin -- I used to epilate, and it irritated my skin terribly, caused spider veins to pop up, and gave me serious ingrown hair issues. I get none of that with no!no!. Definitely would reccommend this product, but only if you have the patience to use it for 3 months, 2-3 times a week just as directed. Don&#x27;t expect some magic instant miracle.</li>
    <li> After carefully viewing all the videos, I had no problems using this product. It did not burn or hurt me and I expected the smell of burning hair.  However, it does not leave my skin smooth.  It has the same stubble feeling as if I had used a razor or shaver, even after using the buffer.  I have used a rotary disc depilator for years and have smooth skin after use, results last several weeks, hair grows back softer, and more sparsely.  In fact most of the hair on my shins and calves no longer grows at all.  Although it was a little painful at first, it is not painful anymore.  I will be returning the no!no! and remaining with my less expensive solution that delivers far better results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost everything - shaving gives me a rash, I&#x27;m allergic to chemical depilatories, I consider the Epilady to be a torture device, and waxing left me with horrible ingrown hairs.  This little baby actually works, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and is painless once you figure out how to use it.  And I can just give myself a going-over every few days while watching TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawbacks - it doesn&#x27;t leave you with baby-smoove skin, there is very slight stubble.  The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it&#x27;s certainly not overwhelming.  The \\&quot;blades\\&quot; don&#x27;t seem to last long.  And I did burn myself in a few spots the first time I used it.  By my second use, I had figured out how to avoid burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> The No!No! does work, it takes time and patience and work! You really have to be committed to doing it! my leg hair was pretty thick and grew really fast, but now it is thinner and there are even parts were hair doesn&#x27;t grow anymore at all! At first I tried to do it like 1 to 2 times a week and now I just do it like 1 a week/2 weeks, it&#x27;s up to you!</li>
    <li> The no!no! works for me. It&#x27;s very slow, yes, but I have experienced significant hair reduction. Unfortunately, after only 5 months it died. Sephora has not responded to my e-mail. I liked the results enough that I am buying another unit but I&#x27;m not happy about it.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair (a waxers dream) and this product didn&#x27;t work for me. I thought No!No! would be the end of waxing and shaving for me...which is why I didn&#x27;t think paying $250 was an issue. But it&#x27;s not worth the money. The smell, the uneven hair removal, etc. Worst of all the advertising would make you think your hair is going to grow back at an amazingly slow rate....nope!</li>
    <li> I watched the so called demonstration on this product on the Home Shopping Network.  I watched as the models and the product reps supposedly removed the hair from their arms, legs, etc.     The first model who was shaving the hair on his arms only shaved in one spot.  He didnt move to any other parts of his arm, and it seems as if the part of his arm that he was shaving, was done beforehand.  This also occured with a female model shaving her legs.  The rest of her legs looked shaved, and she was just moving the product on her leg.  Finally, they did a close up shot of the man selling the product and the product rep. and again, they were only shaving on the same part of their arms, which already looked as if it had been shaved.    Beware, save your $250 for your waxing or as a down payment for professional laser removal, because this products looks like it gives more promises than results.</li>
    <li> I have been using no-no for about a month and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.  It does take a long time like all of the posts state, doesn&#x27;t remove all of the hair (legs are the worst) and leaves stubble.  I use it every other day and there hasn&#x27;t been a change in density or the texture.  The woman who sold it to me at sephora said that she only had to use it every 2 weeks because it slowed hair growth down, but it isn&#x27;t any different than shaving...and at least with shaving it feels smoother.   The posts who are happy with it seem to see a difference at 3 months, so I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get No!No! in the mail and was even ready to set aside the time to use it 2-3 times per week. However, as a busy, working mother of two, I would NEVER have bought this product because it is so time consuming. To No!No! my legs, it typically takes between half an hour to an hour, each time. In that amount of time, I could have shaved my legs and done a million other things. And the results may be (after a few months) some thinning in the amount of hair, but what is the point - you STILL have to shave if you want to be hairless. Is 50% less stubble (if that) worth so much money, especially when you STILL need to shave? Think about it. What is the point??? It is odd that people claim to be excited about a little less hair in areas where they would like to be hairless. This product does not make you hairless. It is pointless.</li>
    <li> I have a nono, I can&#x27;t use it as often as recommended but I do notice substantial amount of hair not growing back.  The smell is annoying but it goes away quickly enough.  Again, don&#x27;t expect a miracle on the first day, it is a long term treatment but I tried laser hair removal and stopped because it was too painful for me and nono is totally PAIN FREE.</li>
    <li> really!!! don&#x27;t know if the NO!NO! works well enough on hair to warrant the price, but i&#x27;ve \\&quot;enjoyed\\&quot; it.  i actually found the smell of burning hair a little cool, meaning it&#x27;s really working, BUT the REALLY amazing thing is: in one area where i have been using it repeatedly (lower thigh)there is an obvious and startling reduction of tiny spider veins.      Press as you firmly stroke the tiny capillaries watching the blood return into the vessels until...voila!! they disappear completely!!!    try it!</li>
    <li> This product is a total rip off.  On my legs it was at least painless, although even using the stubble blade and buffing extensively my legs did not feel completely smooth.  However, I will keep trying it to see if the hair becomes more sparse over time. I also tried it on my arms and that was a mistake, not quite so painless there. I watched the DVD it came with and did everything I was supposed to do. The unit is supposed to turn itself off if it gets to warm but just going over my arms I ended up with several burns from the wire in the blade.  The burns aren&#x27;t severe but even a week later I still have small scabs all over my forearms.  I don&#x27;t know if this actually works for some people, but I think if you have thicker hair it won&#x27;t leave you smooth, and if you have sensitive skin it might even be dangerous.</li>
    <li> I just got my no no today, I have used it on my husband&#x27;s back, and my own legs. So far, so good. It took the hair off my legs very quickly, and I have coarse, dark leg hairs. It worked okay on my husband&#x27;s back, had to trim the hair shorter for quicker/better results. Anxious to see if it lessens the regrowth.</li>
    <li> Every time you kill one of the hair roots-  you have to expect 2 more life cycles. Yes this product will work over time. Just because you get new hair after you use the device it does NOT mean it did not work. It will work over time and that says and achives more then most any other product out there. If I were you I would wait for another prce drop before X-mas. Hopefully it will get down to $99.00,then it will fly off of the shelves at that price.</li>
    <li> I was excited when I ordered this product. As days went by my enthusiasm drifted. When I finally received my no!no! I didn&#x27;t want to use it while my family was home so I decided to wait till everyone was gone-which is today-and I began to use the no!no!. First things first, I did read everything I was suppose to and watched the cd. For some odd reason I was actually scared to use this. I began gliding it up my leg. I could feel the hair burning off my lower leg. The slower I went up my leg the more I began feeling the heat from this laser remover. It freaked me out so I lost my gliding edge. The green light flickered of course and that&#x27;s where the pain came in. It was subtle pricking but that hurt like the dickens. Not only did the pricking hurt, when you&#x27;re done gliding it pricks as well. I was a shaver but got tired of having to shave 2xs a day. I tried waxing but there&#x27;s no thrill of yanking a cloth from your legs only to find that the hairs are still nicely in tack and that you have successfully removed about 2 or 3 layers of skin instead. So I went to epilating. I&#x27;ve been doing this since 2001. I don&#x27;t know why I can tolerate that kind of pain but I can&#x27;t tolerate the pricking of the no!no!. When I realized I couldn&#x27;t handle that sensation on my legs I said aloud to myself &#x27;I weep for my thighs&#x27;. That&#x27;s when I realized I won&#x27;t be using this thing. It took a looong time for me to get use to epilating my thighs because they&#x27;re so sensitive and I&#x27;ll be a monkey&#x27;s uncle if I go through the same thing with this no!no!. I don&#x27;t even want to keep it to see if I could get used to it like my epilator. If something does come out where it actually isn&#x27;t painful then I&#x27;ll try it. Other wise this no!no! is a no!go!.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t seem to upgrade my stars, but I would give it four after nearly a year of use. This summer, I was fortunate enough to go several days without shaving. This is an obvious benefit, I used to have to shave once a day. I notice dark, coarse hair on my legs in small sections. I bet I could count the dark hairs on my legs now, say around 40 or so? Nothing like it used to be. I notice an extreme lightening and thinnng out of the hair on my legs. My hair on my arms, which used to be dark and far too bushy, is now blonder as well.&lt;br /&gt;While this item will make hair blonder and finer with time and many many treatments, it does not improve the overall smoothness. I can still tell when I need to shave my legs because they feel rough, even if I can barley detect the hair visibly.&lt;br /&gt;I pay $260 per laser treatment for my bikini area only, and the lower leg treatments cost just as much (takes 6+ treatments over the course of a year or more for hair loss to be permenent, no results until after the 3rd or 4th treatment), so in that regard, even with the extensive time spent using the device, it&#x27;s an extremley good deal.&lt;br /&gt;A benefit besides cost in comparison to the laser hair removal is the lack of pain. There is no comparison to the sado/masochistic practice of getting your parts zapped with a lazer, while paying a hefty price. I compare it to being hit in the crotch with a hot frying pain (never tried that exactly, but now I don&#x27;t need to?). Of course you cannot really use the no!no! on your personal areas, but gladly I have one to use on my legs and arms, thus saving money and pain.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought maybe 5 boxes of hot blades. The newer they are, the better they work... though I can remove hair with the older ones, but it takes a few passes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using my old buffer that came with the original unit.&lt;br /&gt;The no!no! still works, which is also a benefit. It isn&#x27;t made in China, big suprise! It&#x27;s made in Israel, perhaps an even bigger suprise!&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;d reccomend you purchase one, use it faithfully, and don&#x27;t just do it for the results... do it to improve US/Israel relations. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old review:&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this since last September, so for half a year or so. It seems to be working, I use it most on my arms and I notice a huge difference. Takes a humungo time commitment though, at least an hour for my arms and legs. I am impressed with how long the hot blades seem to last as long as i clean them regularly, however, the buffer refill pack is just awful. The repacement buffers don&#x27;t work at all, the only one that did was the one that came with the unit. Perhaps just shave after treating? I use mine,.. at least one time a week. I try to use it as often as I can tolerate. It doesn&#x27;t hurt, but it stinks like Nair, only worse. There is no pain, it&#x27;s actually somewhat fun to use, just don&#x27;t go over your elbows or creases in the skin or you will burn yourself. It is way cheaper than laser treatments, and sure I could be more impressed but after a few months I am seeing results, so I am happy.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish they had one for the underarms, bikini area (even underneath) and face. As it is, it would be dangerous to attempt using it there. But if they make one, I&#x27;ll buy it! And these ain&#x27;t cheap! Worth it if you are patient.suprise!

    <li> I followed the video instructions exactly.  It seems like it does to something,  just not what you would want it to.  I am a guy and a regular shaver of my back and chest.  This thing took almost 2 hours to get everything and the worst part is that it wasnt any smother than shaving normally is.  Which obviously is one of the key points of buying it.  I wish I could get my 200 dollars back.  Maybe if you are a woman or a person with short hair this thing would work for you. (if you have allot of time too!).  But if you are a guy or someone with thicker hair, please don&#x60;t make the same mistake I did.    No No does a poor explanation of what this product actually does or is capable of.</li>
    <li> This would seem to go without saying, but based on the reviews, it seems some folks simply aren&#x27;t paying attention.    This is NOT an overnight product, nor does it promise immediate results.  It&#x27;s designed to LESSEN the density/thickness of hair overall -- in some cases dramatically -- and takes TIME to accomplish, with proper use.  In fact, I&#x27;d say No!No! marketing was taking the wrong approach in failing to urge folks to use this in conjunction with other methods.  (I say the whole long hair blade-buff-then short hair blade-buff thing is just designed to annoy a large portion of the public.)    Note that, according to the Sephora site info, one can use this method in conjunction with shaving and the hair removal lotions, but if you wax or use rotary removal methods (under-surface hair removal) that you&#x27;ll have to wait until hair makes it near-to the surface for No!No! treatments to have an effect.</li>
    <li> I bought this product when it first came out &amp; I am highly disappointed. It does not work better than shaving (legs not as smooth- even after you buff them!!!) and it&#x27;s time consuming, plus your hair grows back just as quick as shaving. So basically you spend more time removing the hair &amp; it grows back just as quick. Absolutely NOT worth the money. I have fine dark hair and it hardly works well for me. Like I said, time consuming - which would be OK if it worked well &amp; it doesn&#x27;t. I have laser hair removal a few times &amp; it does not compare...with the new lasers (narrow not wide) I hardly feel a thing &amp; I didn&#x27;t have to shave my underarms for 3 months! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product and certainly not for the price. I am selling mine though if anyone wants it....of course at a reduced price.</li>
    <li> I have been using my no! no! for 2 months now.  It has reduced my underarm hair about 50%.  I use it on my arms, which have fine hair and it does a good job of removing it quickly and it seems that the hair is growing back slower and less dense.  I&#x27;m also using it on my legs which have coarse hair and I don&#x27;t think the no! no! works very good on them.  I always have leftover stubble so I still go over the area with a regular razor.  On the coarse hair I have not seen a reduction in hair.  I think the product is fair, because I will have saved money compared to laser hair removal for my arms and underarms.  If you are only planning to buy this for your bikini line or legs, I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I hate to admit that I have chin hair from a hormonal imbalance/PCOS.  I&#x27;ve had it for years, and it&#x27;s just gotten progressively worse.  I&#x27;ve used this about 5 days a week for 3 weeks and I LOVE the fact that my hair is less coarse and just less in general.. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s about a 20-25% improvement.  It&#x27;s expensive, but I was willing to try it, and I&#x27;m very happy with it so far.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s for everyone, but for me, using it this was was great.</li>
    <li> If you buy this expecting a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; then you are in for a disappointment.  However if you are willing to put in the time, then it is soo worth it. Do not buy this if you have blond hair that is easy to shave. This product works best for people who have to shave everyday, and want a reduction.  I have been using for ab 2 months. I use to shave every day, now I&#x27;m down to about every 3 days!</li>
    <li> Okay, listen carefully, you have to be patient with this process! I own this and was very impressed by the results. I have coarse dark hair (me:Italian) and after just one use it removed the hair on my lower legs for a full week. I even forgot to repeat two to three times in that week because my legs were still smooth. A slight stubble came back after a week but then I switched to the \\&quot;wire\\&quot; and the second time was even quicker and easier! I don&#x27;t know why people are having a tough time with this product. It&#x27;s pretty fool-proof. Even if I needed to use the no!no! every week for the rest of my life, it does a better job than ANY waxing, shaving, etc. I&#x27;ve ever tried. AND no bumps! Usually you can see the very ends of the hair cut off at skin level or red irritation from waxing. The no!no! smooths the skin and the hair is GONE!. Invest the time - it works!</li>
    <li> I have been using the no!no! for a few months and my advice to those that are considering dumping money into this product is NO! NO!  I&#x27;ve used it on my arms, legs and, yes, the bikini area.  The best results I saw were on my arms, which is about the same as 3-4 days of growth on my legs.  Nothing came out smooth even with up to 10 passes in the same area despite their warning.  The stubble blade is useless.  I saw better results with just the wire.  The smell is nauseating, and it stays on your skin unless you shower and scrub the treated area immediately.  Its extremely time consuming because of it&#x27;s lack of effectiveness.  The only time I will use this in the future is in the winter when no one will see my legs anyway and I don&#x27;t mind having a little stubble.  The hair on my arms and everywhere else has not grown back any thinner or more sparse.  FYI, I&#x27;m going to my first electrolysis appt tomorrow.  It&#x27;s not as expensive as some would think and it gives you REAL and permanent results.</li>
    <li> I think that this product is not good for the legs or det areas where the hair is darker and stronger but for my arms and belly it helped me. Now i can use t-shirts without thinking about my hairs on my arms. And without no pain.</li>
    <li> I have had this for 2 months now. I have used it before I epilate because it doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair, there is still stubble even after buffing. The hair still comes in as dark as can be and stubble galore. The only plus I can say is if I need to get rid of hair right before I go out and show my legs then I do not have to worry about the red spots that you get from epilating.</li>
    <li> For over a year I have tried to purchase extra blades.  No one sells them, not Sephora, Amazon or directly from the company website.  You spend $200 and the blades need replacing and they do not exist.  Do NOT purchase this product unless you expect it to be disposable after a few uses.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cut back on my need to shave about 60% and seems to be getting more. Worth the price for no in-grown hairs. Nothing else provides that. I find it comparable to laser removal (which doesn&#x27;t last anyway)</li>
    <li> It seemed like it might have been working.     I used mine for about a month. Then I tried to get replacement blades.     They are not available from amazon, from sephora or from the no no website. This makes the device worthless as you need  fresh blades to have it work. I&#x27;ve been trying to get new blades for about 2 weeks and even went to the local Sephora to see if they had the blades. They don&#x27;t and will not be carrying the device after they sell out current stock. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the No NO about 3 months now. I really havent noticed anything other than my hair grows back slower. Im not seeing any patches that are not growing back like they claim. And how you can only use it twice a week is a mystery to me...my hair isnt growing that slow. I have only used it on my legs knee to ankles since I didnt want to invest a lot of time not knowing it would work. I was expecting more since I heard so many great things about this product. They said to allow 6 weeks to notice anything and I still dont notice that it is killing any of the hair. I started out using it every day and use it mostly every other day but have went 3 or 4 days once or twice. So if they suggest to only use it twice a week to notice a difference and I&#x27;m using it more I would think I would notice something quicker. I&#x27;m thinking one of the blades needs replacing since it gave me bad razor burn and one of the hot blades with the wire has already broke. I may give this product another month for results and if my hair is still growing back then its going back to the store for a refund. If they claim you will see results in 6 weeks thats what I expect, not 3 months in and still barely noticing anything. I can buy hair minimizing shaving cream and get the same results I am with the No NO. With both I need a shave in 3 days again. Looks like if I want no hair I&#x27;m gonna have to shell out money for actual laser. Im starting to think I bought something off an infomercial that mailed you trash to get your money.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to open the box as soon as it came in the mail, and I only put it down to write this review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to make sure to test it properly, so I didn&#x27;t shave or wax for over a week beforehand to test it&#x27;s ability to work on longer hairs- they came right off! No pain, no burning, no uncomfortable razor burn, no awful chemical burns (a la sally hanson), and definitely not the the grimacing pain of a rotary epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no!no! easy to master, the hair comes off in seconds, and it&#x27;s enjoyable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without a doubt, this is the best hair remover product that I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the smell of burning hair- not that big of a deal- just light a scented candle while you use it.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for 2 months and it has done a great job, I have relatively coarse hair and am using this on a small area but it has worked great. It does smell like burnt hair but otherwise no complaints, no burns and over time much less hair</li>
    <li> I just purchased the NoNo and so I cannot say anything about how well it keeps hair from growing back in the long run.  However, my experience has still been very positive.  I used it twice on my legs the first week I got it; after that I didn&#x27;t use it for several days, nor did I shave.  It seemed that my hair was growing back thicker, which was kind of unsettling.  However, a few days later I shaved and the difference was amazing!! I have thick black hair and usually after shaving I can feel some stubble and can see black spots under my skin.  Shaving after doing the NoNo only TWO times, my legs were so smooth I couldn&#x27;t stop rubbing them!  I could not feel ANY stubble, my skin was soft, and there were no black spots... it was the smoothest my legs have been EVER!  So I think I am going to keep it, even though $250 is a LOT of money... if I got those results after just a couple of uses, I can only imagine how my legs will look and feel after a couple of months...    I also tried it on my underarms, and I agree that it can be tricky around curves; I burned myself just a little bit (I would say it hurt less than razor burn).  I think I went over the same area too many times, and the results are not as outstanding as they were on my legs (I think this is just because of the curves though), but it still did work, and I will definitely take that mild discomfort over the excruciating pain of an epilator anyday (I have epilated my underarms ... let&#x27;s just say you can&#x27;t wear deodorant or really put your arms down for about a day and a half after epilating! OUCH!!!)  Anyway, sorry for the long review; I just wanted to share my experiences so that all the negative reviews and complaints about the smell of burning hair don&#x27;t outweigh the positives :) Good luck!</li>
    <li> I have had pretty good results so far with the no!no!  I can&#x27;t testify that it prevents hair growth because I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough but I think it is worth the effort for now.  If you are interested in more details on the product and how it works you can check out my blog at [...]</li>
    <li> I have used this faithfully 2-3 times per week for five months now.  What a pain! It takes 30-45  minutes each session, and I never have smooth skin.  The only positive result is that my legs stay smooth the second day after shaving.  I keep using it thinking surely it will work one day, ha, ha.  The blades must be replaced every 2-3 hours of use, which basic math skills will  tell you is after 4-6 uses or one to two weeks.  At $21 for the replacements which contain 3 blades and 2 long hair blades (oh, yeah, using the long hair blade first is recommended if your hair is over 2mm--add another 45 minutes.), well, it gets even more expensive than the original $250.  Lucky girls that say it works for them.  Wish the company offered a longer \\&quot;try me\\&quot; guarantee. I wasted my money!</li>
    <li> its a good product, i like that its pretty much painless, no wax! you have to do it consistently though which can be a pain. But i have seen a change in hair growth and i would recommend it, the only thing is that i had to return mine and order a new one because it burnt out on me. it may have been because i was overusing in one sitting... but i had no idea you could not do that. so i would suggest not using it to the point were you feel it getting hot. if it does seem to be getting warmish turn it off.</li>
    <li> Gosh, it bugs me when people keep falling into the \\&quot;quick and easy\\&quot; boobie trap!  Must everything be \\&quot;quick and easy\\&quot; these days?  I&#x27;ve been epilating for decades, always hated razors due to the nasty stubble, and whenever a less painless device popped up I tried it.  Over the years, epilating did indeed become less painful, plus my legs were used to the slight discomfort.  But a product which, OVER TIME, reduces growth alltogether, hello!, I&#x27;m all for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to epilating I think that No!No! works faster.  Yes, it smells a little, but nowhere near as bad s some reviewer had me worry--after reading her comments I envisioned the stink of burning hair after one got too close to a candle.  Not so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m amazed how LITTLE stubble was left when the device was used properly.  Again, it&#x27;s a slower motion than for instance a razor, yet faster than an epilator.  If I&#x27;m too slow, the heat of the device will let me know, but I have not burned myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in Germany my parents&#x27; motto always was that \\&quot;Nothing worthwhile happens overnight.\\&quot;  This is timeless, proven wisdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re one who believes in 2-hour crafts, dinner in 5 minutes or less, and everything quick and easy, then No!No! is a no-no for you.  It&#x27;s as simple as that.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  She has blond hair--not working too well.  I tried it, brunette. I was waiting for the hair burning smell and there was hardly any smell, but not to much results either.  I was left with stubble.  I will try it faithfully until the 60 day trial is up then probably return it, if I don&#x27;t get better results.  It took longer than shaving in the shower and left stubbly legs!  I was looking for a miracle....</li>
    <li> I have had laser hair removal on various parts of my body; however, am not ready to invest in my full legs.  Therefore, I was looking forward to a cheaper alternative!  I have pretty coarse hair on my lower legs, and finer hair on the upper legs.  I had terrible results with the &#x27;No No No&#x27; product.  I spent about 45 minutes each day for 3 weeks trying to &#x27;shave the hair off my legs and to no avail.  I was left with very prickly legs each day- somewhat similar to a 2-3 day growth.  I went over the areas repeatedly and buffed until i thought my skin was going to come off.  It also left my whole house smelling like burning hair!  (I could live with it, but my boyfriend was horrified ;) )  Needless to say, I will not continue to waste my time.  On the upside, I had no pain with it ;)  Otherwise, it sucked.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I see a lot of 5 and 1-star reviews, and I think people are overreacting in both cases.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my legs and bikini area for about 2 months, and here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found:    Pros: It&#x27;s cheaper than waxing, hair definitely grows back slower and less dense, and between it and the buffing, my legs have never looked smoother.    Cons: It still leaves stubble that you can feel if you run your hand over the skin, it takes a very long time to use (I usually do it while watching TV just to keep from getting bored), and the razors burn out way too quickly.      So if you hate going in for waxes and have time to spare, the NoNo might be worth it.  However, the high initial price plus the cost of replacement razors made me knock it down an extra star.  The fact that I paid $250.00 and will need to keep paying $21.00 every few months to keep using it makes it feel like a scam, especially considering that its results are far from perfect.  I would be much happier with the product if the makers adjusted one or both of those prices.</li>
