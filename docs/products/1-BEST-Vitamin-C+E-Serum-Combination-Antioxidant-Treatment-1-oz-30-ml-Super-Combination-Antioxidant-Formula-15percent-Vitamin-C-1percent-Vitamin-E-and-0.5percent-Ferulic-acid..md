<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The serum is fine but I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in skin tone or texture after use.  Vitamin c quickly degrades in the presence of air and light.  This comes in too large a bottle so by the time you get to the bottom of the bottle the vitamin c has been degraded.  Two smaller bottles would be preferred.</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks of use, I&#x27;m starting to see a difference in my skin tone.  Even my family and friends have noticed my clearer, smoother skin.  I am so happy we my purchase!</li>
    <li> I love this product because I am a heavy exfoliate and peel uses. My face has been through almost everything in the search to clear up adult acne. The best thing I do for me skin is to deep clean and dry it out, my process drys up any new pimples and also allows me to erase marks, so I need something that doesn&#x27;t negate the effort by clogging my pores or adding to the dryness. This stuff has UV protect-ant (necessary after peels on dark skin) and seems to help the new skin heal faster. I am not a doctor but that&#x27;s what it does for me. I notice that when my face is peeling which is often cause i have a lot of old acne scares i am trying to get rid of, my face doesn&#x27;t look wrinkled and worn with new skin under neath. Instead it glows most days.</li>
    <li> I had heard about how C+E feurilic serum was supposed to be one of the best anti-agers out there but could never afford the brand name. I had been using some vitamin C serum and loved it but the brand I used discontinued the vitamin C serum. I stumbled across this on amazon and decided to try it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to brighten as much as some I&#x27;ve used but it is better than a lot of them. It sinks into the skin very quickly and I do notice a much nicer skin tone when I use it regularly. I have combination skin and am prone to acne, and this does seem to help some with the acne. The last few years my skin has been getting extremely dry in the winter and no amount of moisturizer seemed to help (and I&#x27;ve tried tons).  This coupled with a good moisturizer works wonders. It also seems to help with the post-acne marks albeit slightly. I&#x27;ve never used the brand name so I can&#x27;t compare it to that but I&#x27;m pleased with it. I&#x27;m only 27 so I can&#x27;t say how well it does on the anti-aging front but I&#x27;ve heard from dermatologists it&#x27;s supposed to be great. Also I&#x27;ve had several cashiers be completely taken aback after seeing my ID while I was buying wine because they said they were sure I was underage. Not bad for being 27.  I&#x27;ll continue using this, I&#x27;ve tried lots of serums and aside from Avon&#x27;s vitamin C serum they discontinued, this is by far my favorite. The vitamin e in it moisturizes my skin well but doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out. It&#x27;s also works wonderfully coupled with drying acne medications, it helps to balance my skin.</li>
    <li> This seems to be working well.  It is easy to apply and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this product + the B5 hydraulic acid on cosmetic skin solutions website. I have a super sensitive skin which gets sun damaged easily. I read all the great reviews on this products and decided to try them. The shipping was just great, 5 days to Czech Republic. Will make a future review on the results obtained with both serums.</li>
    <li> I has been used Cosmectic skin solution for nearly 2 years now, just in love with these skin care. Price is so reasonable compare to big brand, and it&#x27;s better result than big brand.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so confident with these skin care because I have super sensitive skin. Thanks to cosmectic skin solution skin care products to provide excellent result and soothing my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended products I love: Victamin C + E serum, B5 gel, retinol cream, eye gel and the amazing &amp;#34; day moisturising cream&amp;#34; definitely have to try, give you amazing result on your skin, big different to other moisturiser.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s like the Skinceuticals version (same ingredients) but much cheaper. It&#x27;s done wonders for my skin by improving overall skin tone, texture, and quality. Everyone I recommend this product to has also loved it.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the product and service. It was a quick delivery and everything as ordered</li>
    <li> THIS COMPANY EITHER HAS QUALITY CONTROL PROBLEMS WITH THEIR VITAMIN C SERUM OR IS NOT SELLING WHAT THEY PROMISE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why: I used Whatman pH test paper to determine the Cosmetic Solutions&#x27; serum&#x27;s pH level immediately after receiving it. Surprisingly, it tested at a shocking pH level of 0 which is way too acidic to put on anyone&#x27;s skin....yet the company promises a pH level of 2.3 to 2.5 which would be appropriate and effective. (Rest assured, Whatman pH test paper is a very reliable, foolproof way to make a pH determination that chemists use in the lab.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE CONCERNED! The pH level of a Vitamin C serum is critical to determine if you are using a beneficial serum or not and any inquiries to Cosmetic Solutions through an email will confirm this. (You can do a Google search, as well; there are lots of great skin care websites to help you better understand what constitutes an effective Vitamin C serums for the skin.)  Interestingly, if you send Cosmetic Solutions a friendly email to inquire about their product&#x27;s pH level, they will tell you their product has a desirable pH level of 2.3 to 2.5 and why this is a critical range to be effective....yet it failed to pass their own perimeters of what they promised when I tested it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to this important concern, their customer service is horrible. For starters, you cannot return their product (which is included in their Amazon product description). Naively, I had hoped that they would rectify the situation with my serum after I shared my test results and concerns. After numerous emails with them over this pH issue, they did not offer to refund my money or replace it with a new bottle. Absolutely nothing; they just dropped correspondence with me after a few weeks. Now, I am out $40 and have a bottle of Vitamin C serum that I dare not put on my face because it is too acidic for human skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what are the options if you take a pass on the Cosmetic Solutions&#x27; product? Either mix your own serum (there are plenty of websites that can walk you through the do-it-yourself process and save you money) or you can buy the more reliable but expensive Skinceuticals Vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit on 12-19-2013: I now see that this company DOES accept returns. This is a change in their policy since my original comments were posted. This is a welcome change. If they had not ignored me or allowed me to return the bottle I purchased, I certainly would have taken advantage of that. Unfortunately, they did not... and they still have not reached out to me which is something that companies who sell on Amazon can opt to do through their sales here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waiting to hear from you, Cosmetic Solutions!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for about a month now and my skin definitely looks a lot better. In order to really see if this serum was making a difference - I have been using it regularly each morning and not using any other treatments or serums. I top it with a light moisturizer and at a night I just use a plan moisturizing cream. I also followed an aestheticians&#x27; advice to use gentle cleansers and not get overzealous with face scrubs. My skin looks brighter and my generally large pores look much better with less congestion. I am truly surprised and pleased with this serum. Like other reviewers said - the texture is very watery but you get used to it quickly - it spreads easily and absorbs quickly so you can get on with your moisturizer. I store it in a bathroom drawer to keep it from oxidizing in the light.</li>
    <li> This serum absorbs quickly and leaves a slightly oily touch which disappears after 1-2 minutes. My skin is firmer and more radient. It is like skinceuticals ce with half price. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is more like a \\&quot;skin supplement\\&quot; than a moisturizer so I do add an additional eye cream and face cream for the hydration. I hope the company will also develop an eye cream and face cream so that I can use them as a complete regimen.</li>
    <li> My esthetician recommended me using Skinceuticals C E Ferulic serum on my face along with the treatment I was undergoing.  The Skinceuticals product costs more than three times as much as Cosmetic Skin Solutions C E Ferulic serum.  I did a comparison of the ingredients, which were identical to the higher priced Skinceuticals.  So I bought it, and am so glad.  Most importantly, it is working just like the higher priced serum, even better.  This serum goes on smoothly and it&#x27;s like giving my thirsty face a drink.  Suddenly my skin is soothed and smooth, and my skin is nicely prepped for make-up, although lately I find I don&#x27;t need to wear make-up because my skin is looking so good without it.  The Skinceuticals serum had a nasty smell, like cooked hot dogs, this has a faint oder, not hot dogs but just a faint smell, not so much that you are repulsed by it, and the smell evaporates almost immediately when you smooth it on your face.  I use this serum after I wash and tone my face, and then I use sun-screen over it.  People tell me my skin looks brighter and some have asked if I&#x27;ve had any \\&quot;work done\\&quot; because it&#x27;s so smooth.  Nope, this serum is my \\&quot;secret\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This product is true to form.  I am constantly in the sun and have sun damage and sun spots. After using it for a few weeks I already noticed an improvement in texture and appearance. I definately recommend this product!  I have been so impressed with this product and is so affordable, I bought some for my mother and sister!  They love it also..  I am satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeing Skinceutical&#x27;s C+E Ferulic serum for months but as a full-time college student, their prices are pretty steep. So after browsing through the web, I came across CSS&#x27;s similar version. I bought my first sample and have been using it for around 4-5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that it works! I&#x27;ve seen positive, visible results. My skin is (a bit) brighter than the usual and my sister commented that my face looks \\&quot;fresher\\&quot; nowadays.  Another thing about this product is that it works well in combination with my other beauty products.  So after I apply it in the mornings, I wait for 5-10 minutes for it to be absorbed then I apply my Oil of Olay daily moisturizer.  It also blends well with my make-up products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the company itself, CSS&#x27;s online support provides a thorough and prompt customer service.  I can attest to this because I&#x27;ve been asking their reps a lot of questions like how and where to store the product, how to apply it, etc.  They have been very patient with me and as I said, I get a response within a day.  Even when all I did was convey my enthusiasm for having found a more affordable version, they responded right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, CSS&#x27;s C+E Ferulic serum is a beauty secret that is worth talking about :-)</li>
    <li> My dermatologist laughed at me when I whined and moaned that at 31, my skin doesn&#x27;t look as fresh and tight as it did at 25. She laughed really hard. Anyway, she recommended the Skinceuticals product and I got this cheaper alternative.     I love it! It&#x27;s funky to put on but after a minute my face gets rosy pink with all the increased blood flowage. After a couple minutes there&#x27;s a great fresh glow akin to what you might see in \\&quot;sex afterglow.\\&quot; Pardon the comparison, but that&#x27;s the best way I can describe it.     Great product. I&#x27;ll be buying more before they screw up the formula or hike the price.</li>
    <li> I have used the Vitamin C serum  AOX from Cosmetic Skin Solutions before and I love it! So, I decided to try this one as well. I have been using this serum for the last few days and I love this product! I love the Vitamin C serum too, but this one seems to work more on my lines on the face. I use it daily now.    My daily routine is: I use Vitamin C serum when I have been out in the sun all day for any sun damage or hyper pigmentation (like if we go to the beach)and use Vitamin C+E Ferulic Combination for daily use!!    I would definitely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> This product is almost identical to skinceuticals ce ferulic. I found this more watery in consistency. I would be really interested in knowing what the PH of this product is ? The skinceuticals is formulated at PH 3. A vitamin c serum must be formulated at a PH lower  than 3.5 or it simply sits ON the skin, and doesn&#x27;t enter the skin cell which is where the healing and protection takes place.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year, I used a much more expensive vendor before, but this lower priced one seems to work just as good and cost 1/3 the price.   I have started using this after at home microneedling (derma roll) and wow the combination is amazing.   This company ships very fast.</li>
    <li> I wasted my money on this one.  It does NOTHING at all~I think the main ingredient is water ;-(</li>
    <li> Almost identical ingredients to Skin Ceuticals CE Ferulic, which is over $100 for the same 1 oz.  However, it does not seem to be as &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; as Skin Ceuticals.  I would recommend Cosmetic Skin Solutions as a cost saving alternative.  Ferulic acid appears to be the latest popular skin anti oxidant ingredient!</li>
    <li> Just barely started using it a few days ago, and I can already see and feel a difference. I have used the name brand version, and I totally think this one is better. It even smells better. Your face will thank you. Don&#x27;t forget to apply it to your neck... I am in my early 20&#x27;s and I will use this forever!! Can&#x27;t wait to see how awesome my skin looks in 30 years - if they keep making it, I will keep using it!</li>
    <li> Like most other reviewers, I used to use Skinceuticals C E Ferulic and decided to give this product a try after seeing the price and reviews. The only difference between the two seems to be the extra ingredient \\&quot;hyaluronic acid\\&quot; in this generic version, but a quick Google search confirmed that it should be safe to use. Otherwise, the two products are identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After a period of use, it seems that this product does not give the same results as Skinceuticals. Too bad, since it was so much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this product but after only a few days I can see a difference in the texture of my skin. My face looks brighter and is so much smoother. I love this product and the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a couple of weeks and thought it was fine, and then I started to get acne that was deep in my skin.  Up until this point I had perfectly clear skin.  The only thing that I changed in my skin care regimen was that I had added this product, so I decided to stop using it.  It took a couple of weeks but my skin is now completely clear again. I will definitely never purchase this product again. It is an expensive product considering it was horrible for my skin and now I can not return it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few weeks and have seen definite improvements in skin tone  and tightening of  texture/pores.  Excellent addition to skin regimen for skin that was already in pretty good condition for 65+ years of age -- but this has made it better. My skin  tends to be on the dry side and sensitive from use of Retin-A product and exfoliation, but this serum causes no problem whatsoever  Serum has no odor and no color and is kept in closed cabinet. will update if I see any changes.  Also, excellent customer service-- very responsive to emails.  I had a bottle that I had not used for a long time -- and it had oxidized.  they replaced it free of charge so I could start fresh.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> When I first ordered Cosmetic Skin Solutions Vit C and E Serum with Ferulic acid, it was very much like the much more expensive Skinceutical C and E Ferulic Serum (same list of ingredients), but this time my skin reddened and broke out. When I examined the ingredients, I see the order has been changed from the last Cosmetic Skin Solution bottle. Beware. This may work for you, but I am returning to the Skinceutical product prescribed by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to know whether it works, but it is impossible to use and does make the skin incredibly dry.  The instructions say to apply 5-6 drops to face/neck, but the product is the consistency of water so, if you count the drops onto your fingers it runs straight through them and if you put it straight onto the face it drips off before you can rub it in.  Also...when this product drops onto a surface such as the bathroom vanity and/or if you put the bottle down anywhere it stains the surface bright yellow and is not removable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this product were thickened and the consistency of the Hydra B Gel it would make it much easier to use...I bought both products, but find I don&#x27;t use the Vitamin c &amp; E serum for all the above reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had this item been returnable I would have sent it back....</li>
    <li> After using this product less than a week I got a VERY bad skin reaction: red, sore, irritated. Stopped using it immediately. Skin returned to normal. I would NOT recommend this product (Originally reviewed this product noting it had an unpleasant smell. That&#x27;s a minor problem, I now see.)</li>
    <li> My item just arrived a couple of days ago and i cant wait to use it right away. however, like i always do before i use a new product for my face...i test it to the back of my hand for reactions over 24hr. i cant use just any product because i always have a very sensitive skin. Most of the time it is a disappointment on my side unable to use any kind i like. but this time, i made an exception just for a couple of hrs i tested it and there was no reaction at all! then, i applied it to the areas needed and was amazed how it was easily absorbed on my skin leaving a soft, velvety trace...been using it for 3 nights only and i can see my fine lines near the corner of my outer eye is disappearing!!!! Amazing...    It seemed to me, my skin like a very dry soil that needs water for nourishment and this product gave whatever it needs! will definitely, recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Have started using this product for about 3 weeks. I use it every morning after I wash my face and before my normal makeup routine. So far, I feel good about using it. I normally have dry, sensitive skin and this makes me feel good that I am putting something restorative back into my skin. The 1oz bottle will last a long time. After I&#x27;m through with this bottle, I will reassess if it really helped/changed my skin or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update-have finished the bottle and will not reorder. Don&#x27;t really see any difference.</li>
    <li> I have used and reordered several times. I won&#x27;t buy again.It turns bad before I use 1/2 of the bottle. I even use it on my throat, chest and forearms yet at 1/2 a bottle I have to throw it away. That&#x27;s throwing away $20 every time I order. When they make a 1/2 oz bottle for less, then I&#x27;ll buy again.  JR</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading about it on a \\&quot;product twins\\&quot; blog. I previously used the other product which I loved; however, at a third of the price, I thought this was worth a try. I&#x27;m 100% pleased with it. Same feel, same results, NOT same price! I will definitely recorder this product.</li>
    <li> Seems to compare with the more expensive brand and is about half the price.  - So far so good</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t have a lot of hope for this product. I&#x27;ve been using it about a month and my skin looks better. My melasma has decreased. I plan on buying this again. I agree with the other reviews and can&#x27;t add anything more. I&#x27;ve even been told by a couple of people they can see the difference. Now, if I can just keep my face out of the sun, I will be able to maintain my look. Even with sunscreen, it doesn&#x27;t take much for my face to darken with brown spots of melasma.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product and arrived as expected. I would order this item again.</li>
    <li> I have used this for the past three months faithfully and this product has achieved amazing results for me - my skin is much less red, I have noticed a decrease in hyperpigmatation, my skin tone has evened out, and there has been a noticeable decrease in fine lines and wrinkles.  Worth every penny and then some.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;m 23 and bought this product for prevention, I think it works right. And though I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet I notice my skin is firmer and a bit tighter. I also notice that my skin has now a nice healthy glow. So, overall, I think this product works and although I can&#x27;t give a better review I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Stings after application. Terrible odor. Contains a lot of harmful preservative chemicals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this before and I&#x27;ve just bought it again.  While no serum can completely get rid of wrinkles or other issues, this serum *does* make my skin look more even and younger, make it feel wonderful, and *doesn&#x27;t* make it break out at all.  The latter is significant because I have a history of breaking out from pretty much everything I&#x27;ve put on my face  (I&#x27;m in my late 40s and sometimes still got bad reactions from mainstream skin treatments).  It&#x27;s so pure, has everything good and nothing bad.  I&#x27;ve come to depend on it and I hope they never stop making it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this CE Ferulic serum by mistake, thinking I was getting a low price on Skinceuticals CE Ferulic serum, which I had purchased before and liked. When this came, I realized it wasn&#x27;t the same. I almost sent it back but I decided I&#x27;d give it a try. I am SO HAPPY I did! It works just as well as the Skinceuticals serum PLUS it applies easier and smells better. I apply it at night and my face is velvety smooth in the morning. It evens my skin tone and softens my wrinkles. I&#x27;m very, very satisfied with this product and recommend it. This is a first-rate skin treatment for a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I am almost 28 years old and decided it was time to really start taking care of my skin. My boyfriend just turned 40 and looks amazing... and here I am at 28 with fine lines around my eyes and laugh lines when I smile big! But other than that my skin looks pretty good. I don&#x27;t get out too much in the sun... not because I don&#x27;t want to but because working full time in front of a desk and being a mom doesn&#x27;t allow for much sun bathing! So my skin had fairly even tone and no spots but I was amazed that this product made such a dramatic difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is amzaing... I used just 3-4 drops the first night. It felt great. It instantly made me skin feel smoother and looked much brighter. I went to bed and woke up with the softest skin. That morning I used it again right after the shower. It instantly tightens, smoothes the skin, and brightens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to have oily skin and breakouts and this seems to heal blemishes faster and didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knows its $30 a bottle but you use so little and its a fraction what the other brands cost for the same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sold. I LOVE this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****NOTE***** Today is May 24 which means I have been using this product for roughly a month now. I use it every morning right after I get out of the shower. My skin looks so much brighter and smoother having added this to my skin care regimen. On the weekends, I find myself using this, my moisturizer/spf and a little of my smashbox primer instead of makeup and feel completely confident in my appearance. Its amazing how much my skin has improved without realizing it had that much room to improve! I also have noticed undery my eyes and my crows feet are much more smooth. The only downside is with my skin being overall more healthy, it does leave a bit of a shine to my face after I apply it.</li>
    <li> I can not say it works well or not. I only use it for two weeks. So far, ok. but I noticed it is very thin compare to other brand i used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lower priced formula for several weeks now &amp; I can tell the difference.  It is not as good as SkinCeuticals.  I notice my skin is dryer &amp; tends to flake more.  Next time I order I will go back to C+E Ferulic by SkinCeuticals which I have been using for several years.  It kept my face from feeling &amp; looking dry.</li>
    <li> I tried this because it was so much cheaper than SkinCeuticals.  Did NOT see same results as I did with the SkinCeuticals brand.  When I use SC people constantly compliment my skin, but my complexion doesn&#x27;t look good after six weeks of using this stuff.  After I purchaseed it I also learned SkinCueticals has a patent on this serum so they are sselling it illegally!  If you actually want results, you have to buy the real brand.</li>
    <li> Smell is a bit strange at the very beginning, but you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;I use 3 to 4 drops on my face and it absorbs pretty quickly. Then I apply an hydrating cream.&lt;br /&gt;Good serum overall.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! Equally as goo as the more expensive brands and totally worth the investment!</li>
    <li> C+E Ferulic Combination Antioxidant Treatment - 1 oz/30mL - Premium Antioxidant formula with Advanced AOX Technology  is exactly the same as the skin solutions product. It is an excellent product!</li>
    <li> Love this vitamin c &amp; e serum. Does exactly what it says it does. Has in it what was recommended on the Dr Oz show.</li>
    <li> I too used to pay $100+ for a more expensive brand of CE Ferulic serum from my dermatologist. I believe my old one was 15% L-ascorbic (vit. C) whereas this one is 20%. Bumping up the concentration was definitely a good move for me - my skin is now ridiculously clear, even, and glowing. It literally looks lit from within - sometimes I look in the mirror and am just amazed that a product can do this. Any baby wrinkles that started creeping into my 27 year old face has now been sufficiently beaten back into submission. A combination of this serum in the morning with a good sunscreen on top, plus Retin A at night has made my skin so flawless that I don&#x27;t have to wear skin makeup anymore (just a dab of concealer under my eyes - unfortunately this isn&#x27;t going to do much about the fact that I get too little sleep). This is coming from a girl that typically puts on a full face of makeup every morning. I told a co-worker I was only wearing eye makeup one day and she was blown away, &amp;#34;But your skin, it&#x27;s so perfect!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Update his is the 4th order of this product to the UK, I think the quality is great, took 7 days to arrive in the UK well packed, always really impressed. I have some redness on my décolletage and within minutes the redness subsides. Very impressed CSS.   i have used the skinceuticals for nearly 2 years but how expensive it was getting,so found this on internet.received today skin loved it smelt(hot doggy) the same as skincurticals product if not a bit lighter,and the product was clear in colour, went on well.will have to wait and see in long term if as good but seems a professional company well packaged and good delivery.would definately order again.</li>
    <li> I started using this serum about a year ago after trying the much more expensive Skinceuticals version and breaking out.  I also tried the cheaper NuFountain version which is supposed to be made fresh but it did not give me good results and also makes me break out although less than Skinceuticals.  I have since returned to the Cosmetic Skin Solutions brand and indeed, it is working great for me again.  It is the only one that seems to genuinely keep my skin smooth without causing bad breakouts.  I am a 36 year old natural redhead with fair, sensitive skin and have always struggled with hormonal acne so striking just the right balance with my combination oily/dry/aging skin is the only way to keep it clear and smooth and this is one of those products that actually works for me so I highly recommend it.  Right now I&#x27;m having over drying from being inside during the winter so I&#x27;m only using it in the morning but in the summers I usually use it both morning and night with good results.  I also use a very light retinoid at night, do a BHA peel once a week, and use a sulfur based cleaner (Clenia) and benzoyl peroxide spot treatments (Duac) at night and this product works beautifully with all of these other things I do to my face to keep my large pores from clogging.  I definitely noticed a difference when I tried to substitute the other brands and have now come back to this one as my standard.  Not only do I have clear skin now but consistently get mistaked for being about 10 years younger due to my very smooth skin.  Definitely a thumbs up from me!</li>
    <li> Great product and an even better price. I mhave used this product for approximately 2 weeks and see a drastic improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00163JVJQ CE Ferulic Combination Antioxidant Treatment - 1 oz / 30 ml - Super Combination Antioxidant Formula - 15% Vitamin C, 1% Vitamin E, and 0.5% Ferulic acid.]] I have been using this product, for well over 1 year!! I was a counter Manager for a big skin care company. I have tried MANY products, but none have improved my skin as much as this one!! I love, and tell all of my friends about this. I bought a bottle for my sister and a friend as a gift, and they also love it!! This is even better than 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I am a blond and blue eyed and have had several basal cell skin cancers removed.  I feel that this product gives me a bit extra sun protection.  The product has also help fade some old acne scars (and I am over 50!  The skinceuticals product is great but this is so much cheaper and I feel it has worked just as well.  Keep this in a cool dry place (under the skin in vanity is fine.) In a 2005 paper in the \\&quot;Journal of Investigative Dermatology\\&quot; it states....This combination of pure natural low molecular weight antioxidants (e.g., ferulic acid and vitamin C and E) provides meaningful synergistic protection against oxidative stress in skin and should be useful for protection against photoaging and skin cancer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for over a month and it has improved the overall appearance of my skin, as well as firming and toning. The serum is light and sinks right in, did not irritate my sensitive skin at all. I would not go a day without it, now that I have discovered you can have the same product as Skinceuticals for a fraction of the cost. Apply to cleansed face in the morning, I then follow with my fave moisturizer. I do plan on trying the B5 Hydrating gel next. Stay tuned for more reviews, Thanks, Cosmetic Skin Solutions! Keep up the good work...</li>
    <li> My wife said this product had too much water in it, and it was not effective as the brand name that cost 3 times as much.</li>
    <li> Unsure about how effective this product is yet.</li>
    <li> Very nice results over 2 weeks. Even tones and loosen fine lines. Great price compared to the name brand products in stores. The only thing that should change is instead of a dropper, and pump top would be ideal for this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always getting compliments on my skin now and I am 44 years old and very fair...I noticed a huge difference when I started using these sorts of serums and not only is this one of the best I&#x27;ve tried but the price is outstanding.  I&#x27;ve also tried the Phloretin CF and the B hydrating gel and love both !!!</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY.  I have tried other brands of serum and none of them have ever smelled this bad.  I am tolerant but I had to throw it away.  I have seen this posted by others, also.  Buyer beware, I strongly suggest other Vit C Hyaluronic acid serums, such as OZ Naturals.</li>
    <li> Started seeing a difference in less than a week. No lie&lt;br /&gt;My skin was smoother and brighter&lt;br /&gt;I am not one to exaggerate. I have to admit I tried a competitor after this ran out and I&#x27;m so disappointed. I&#x27;ve been using more of it just so I can justify buying this one again. Great job, Cosmetic Skin Solutions for making something affordable that works!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 7 months. Now I feel my skin is getting brighter. I love this product because it contains vit C and E in one package. Because of this product I got many compliments from people around me. They told my skin is glowing and shining. I will recommend this product to all friends and family. Thanks CSS!</li>
    <li> The serums are very effective.  I would recommend to everyone.  Men should also use these serums to keep their skin looking good. they are truly powerful antioxidant and anti-aging agents.    I put some C+E Ferulic, Phyto + gel and B5 hydrating on my face and neck and chest and then my regular cream with sun screen for my daughter to see the impact.  She said said it looks like new skin.  I didn&#x27;t say that she did.    I think the liquidity of the serums help the skin to absorb it rapidly.    I also use the phloretin and the C20.  They are excellent too and I will coninue to use them also.    If I had started this at 20 or 30, my skin would look even better.  I just found this at over 50 yrs of age.  for you   younger people, I would start now!    Kim</li>
    <li> After reading reviews I decided to try this and I am so glad I did.  I have dry not particularly sensitive skin so this was great for me and didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts/reactions.  I am just now starting to notice some fine lines and use this in the morning after washing my face before any moisturizer.  It is a water consistency and I use about 5 drops for my face, neck and chest.  I would say one bottle lasts me 2 to 3 months.  I also store it in my fridge to help preserve it.  Anyway this soaks into my skin and leaves it glowing.  When I first started using people always complimented my skin.  I have since tried the AOX 20 C + Ferulic, which doesn&#x27;t have vit. e, but is cheaper and it has had the same effects.  I am next going to try the Phloretin one.</li>
    <li> C+E Ferulic was my first serum from Cosmetic Skin Solutions, which I used in combination with the Hydrating B5 Gel (also  Cosmetic Skin Solutions). After the first application of both products you can see an immediate effect, the skin is optimally moisturized and is kind of firmer. My skin looked gradually more evenly and most of the pigment spots are gone now, unfortunately not all of them i have some really dark ones). All over my skin looks great and I highly recommend these two products for all with normal to dry skin. My skin tends to be oilier when it gets warmer, so see also my review for the Phloretin C+F Serum, which is my favourite for mixed or oily skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for past 2 years, and I really like it. You can tell this product from Cosmetic Skin Solutions is a great vitamin c product as the serum/texture is white which means it hasn&#x27;t oxidized. Make sure to tightly close right after use so it does not oxidize. Great product!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I keep getting a lot of complements and my skin feels so good after I put it on and it goes on smooth. I have tried other vitamin C serum but they feel just like water on your face but with this one is different. I love it and i&#x27;m getting one for my mom as well.</li>
    <li> I believe the best way to get a feeling for a product is to read a variety of reviews from different sources.  I read all of these reviews before I tried it, as the majority are very helpful to me in choosing the right product for my skin.  I found that most of the reviews are very positive, with the very few which weren&#x27;t didn&#x27;t make any bit of sense at all which leaves me to be suspicious as to if they actually used the product, or just left the review to be one of those online pests who&#x27;s job is an online product reviewer leaving not so good and false info in hopes of persuading buyers.....well, it didn&#x27;t fool me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I decided to go for it and am so glad I did.  This product is wonderful; it does everything it says and more! I like how it keeps my skin tone and complexion even.  My lines are smoothed and softened.  I Love how my skin is getting the daily protection it needs.  A little bit goes a long way and the results are noticeable after the first week of use!  I also saved $100 in comparison to the skinceutical price.  It&#x27;s such a great feeling to know I&#x27;m getting the same, if not better results for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, I will add, I did have a couple of questions and when I called the Cosmetic Skin Solutions number I found that they are very friendly and helpful and get back to you promptly.  I like to purchase from a company that provides a phone number and is very helpful.</li>
    <li> I have to say, since I started using this I have def noticed my skin tone evening out. Mind you, I use a comprehensive arrange of products which I layer. But.... I&#x27;m gonna have to say since it&#x27;s incorporation I see a difference.  Really like that it sinks in nicely.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> After having used Skinceuticals for several years, I became aware of the CSS products when reading an article on Truthinaging.  It compared this product to the SkinCeuticals and said it was basically a product double at a much lower price. Since the SC is very expensive, I thought I would give this a try.  Over the last 6 months, I had been using the CSS Advanced Vit C Serum and really like the way it makes my skin look, so I decided to try this product next, based on the awesome reviews on several different sites.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and so far so good although, I have been sick so my skin is not at it&#x27;s best anyway. The only concern I have had with the CSS products is that the seem to \\&quot;discolor\\&quot; rather quickly.  When I receive the product, it is clear but a month or so into it, it turns orange/brown.  So I end up trying to use them up rather quickly before they \\&quot;go bad\\&quot;.  I would like to know why they turn so quickly?</li>
    <li> I have severely sun-damaged skin and, upon my dermatologist&#x27;s urging, have been using a C &amp; E serum with ferulic acid every day for the past 20+ years.  For me, it has been a miracle worker in keeping my skin clear and bright.  When I first started this serum, Skinceuticals was the product brand recommended (and sold) by my dermatologist.  Costly, to say the least!  I discovered the Cosmetic Skin Solutions product via Amazon about 5 years ago; compared the ingredients with those in the product I&#x27;d been using; discussed it with my doctor . . and have been using their Vitamin C+E Serum/Advanced Formula+ ever since.</li>
    <li> Love the SkinCeuticals C+E Ferulic, but not the $100+ price tag, searched for clones, tried this, has he very same effect on my skin, clearer liquid, less viscosity, seems perfect, will definitely keep purchasing&lt;br /&gt;If anyone finds why it is cheaper, other than markup of SkinCeuticals, please report here.</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrible - gave me blackheads and when I did a little more research it turns out that the great reviews all seem to be paid reviewers! Check out their other reviews for products and you can tell - they all sound similar. This stuff does not work!</li>
    <li> I like it... I put it in the morning as a base and then put sunscreen on top, I have not gotten new sun spots.</li>
    <li> Got this to use daily after cleaning my face with my new neutrogena microdermabrasion system, and WOW, what amazing results!  This stuff is like the perfect moisturiser for my face, because it has just enough oil in it to hydrate, without clogging anything or makeing my old oily patches oilier.  I&amp;#34;m not sure if it&#x27;s really doing anything for my complexion, or if it&#x27;s all in my head, but I think my skin is looking healthier over-all since I started using my new face care regime, but hey, the price isn&#x27;t too bad for this, and a little goes a long way, so I&amp;#34;ll keep it up.</li>
    <li> Did not notice any improvement in my skin after using for 2 months, which is when this serum oxidized. I have about half of the bottle left. It also has a very medicinal smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on and off for the past 2 years.  I&#x27;ve tried different products, but always come back to this one.  I smooth it on clean dry skin in the morning to protect my skin and help reverse damage from sun and environment.  I love the way my skin glows after applying it.  I use my favorite moisturizer (Clinique Dramatically Different Gel Moisturizer) over the top and my skin is ready for make-up.  Since using this, I feel confident to wear only a light BB cream and a little blush.  Not bad for 45.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It not only has Vitamin C that evens skin tone but also Vitamin E which is a fantastic skin vitamin.</li>
    <li> I think this is a brilliant product and will be buying it all the time. They are very good with the price too.</li>
    <li> I knew that I liked this C E Ferulic  Serum (by Cosmetic Skin Solutions) after using it  only a few weeks, but what proved my feelings to be right was when my adult daughters said, \\&quot;OK Mom, what have you been doing to your face?  It looks better than ever!\\&quot;  Both of them immediately purchased the product and are loving it!  I find it equal to the SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic which is 144.00 not including tax or shipping. This same thing is only 39.85.  That makes me like it even more !&lt;br /&gt; Laura Lewis</li>
    <li> I was a die-hard user of Skinceuticals for years until I just got tired of paying so much. Did a search and found this product online. Read the reviews at several different sites, liked the price and figured, why not try it? SO glad I did! LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully for the past two years along with the B5 gel and can really see a huge improvement in my skin tone (it feels firmer) and fine lines have definitely decreased. I had terribly dry skin for a time and these products have really helped to keep my face well-hydrated without breakouts and irritation. I highly recommend C+E and the B5 Gel!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.  Have purchased now for the third time.  It is of consistent high quality and prompt shipping at a fair price.</li>
    <li> ... And didn&#x27;t do much else. I didn&#x27;t see any positive results and had to discontinue use after 2 weeks after causing significant acne.</li>
    <li> The noticable and dramatic effects of this product offers are astounding.  I&#x27;m on my third bottle of it after having tried a number of other products by well known, very high end makers - which did not satisfy me.  It&#x27;s easy and simple to use, it contains ingredients in nice proportions, results can be felt almost immediately, and it&#x27;s priced affordably (for me).  The results I reap from using it regularly meet my high expectations and exceed results from competitors.  Smooth, velvet-like skin, that&#x27;s even &amp; brightened in tone and clarity is difficult to achieve without using this product.  It has never clogged pores or caused any other sensitivity issue (to which I&#x27;m prone) and it has almost no aroma (good ro bad).  I love, will continue to buy it &amp; highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Half the price of Skinceuticles with the same great effect.</li>
    <li> sat on skin (sticky), smelled odd, seemed to agitate my skin rather than help it</li>
    <li> This serum made me fall in love with the brand. I have only been using it for a few days and I can already notice a difference. I have been using it every morning under the B5 gel and despite my oily skin, I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or irritations. Definitely something I will continue to purchase. I&#x27;m about to purchase the B5 gel and maybe the under eye gel because I am so impressed with this product I can&#x27;t wait to try other products in this line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a year and half. My skin has change dramatically- smooth, glowing and even toned. I&#x27;m hooked! Thank you CSS.</li>
    <li> After seeing a talk show with a dermatologist on it saying that &amp;#34;after washing your face in the morning with a good exfoliant and shaving, the only thing men should use on their skin is a good Vitamin C+E serum and then a moisturizer with SPF of 15 or higher.  No aftershave or heavy creams or lotions.&amp;#34;  I decided to get rid of my daily routines that clearly weren&#x27;t giving me the results I wanted.  I ordered this product and have been completely happy with the results.  My skin feels fresher, firmer, and protected from free radicals that can damage skin on a daily basis. Plus I&#x27;ve noticed a more even tone to my skin.  It just looks healthier.  Very noticeable results after just 1 month of use.</li>
    <li> After just a few weeks of use I could already start to see my fine lines reduced and months later drastically reduced. The potent ingredient combination of this serum will do wonders for your skin and won&#x27;t irritate like many other vit C &amp; E products do.The great price and non-toxic ingredients are an added bonus.</li>
    <li> I have been using Vitamin C+E Serum for years and could notice the difference right away. I am faithful to this product not only for the price which is the best around but the potency of the product.</li>
    <li> After trying a more expensive brand, I found cosmetic skin solutions.  not only is the price affordable, but the products are effective, make my skin glow and seems to make me look younger. I first tried the sample pack, that help to figure out my correct combination. I found the Vitamin C+E,  then the B work really well for me, then at night the resurfacing, and of course the eye. next I will trying their cream.  I strongly recommend Cosmetic Solutions products. They are great and when I had questions and emailed the company, they answered all my questions.&lt;br /&gt;Love their products!  You have to try them.</li>
    <li> Love this serum!  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months now and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin tone, especially after a summer of sun and fun at the beach. Less blotchy, redness gone and I&#x27;ve got more of a glow.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this serum, it has improve the appearance of my skin. I have been using it as an astringent for about a month now and I am very pleased with the results..</li>
    <li> This is my go to skin care! I love this vitamin c serum. I have drawers full of skin care products and nothing works as beautifully.</li>
    <li> My skin is very thick and tough but this treatment literally burned my skin and left red marks everywhere which has never happened.  Stay away from this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks and I have already seen a difference in the tone and texture of my skin. I have a nice healthy glow. My skin can be sensitive but myskin has adapted to it and I have no problems using every day.I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Super product when used for healing or generally for the skin.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. People keep asking me what I am doing to my face. I was concerned it would not be as effective as the $130 bottle from the spa but it works just as well.</li>
    <li> Best serum that I have ever used.  Can really tell a difference in using it.  Same as the more expensive serums but at a fraction of the cost.  Please keep up the good work in creating these products!</li>
    <li> I use this day and night on my face and neck for extra sun protection.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost speechless at how good this is!!! I&#x27;m ordering two more bottles--one for myself and one for my mother!!&lt;br /&gt;Smooth, supple and even skin in a week! Can&#x27;t wait to see after a month!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend as a gift. She was talking about it and I wanted to surprise her. It did work nicely and she was very happy. She has been using it for a while now and she likes it. Not sure how much of the claimed effects are true, but I am a guy and what do I know about these things?!!! One thing for sure that there was no adverse reaction of side effect as this was one of my concerns. So even for this, I think this product deserves 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Expensive product haven&#x27;t seen a difference since the short time, I have been using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;It might work for you but for me I have not seen a difference.</li>
    <li> I am using this product everyday for younger looking skin&lt;br /&gt;I apply a few drops over face and neck area then apply my&lt;br /&gt;skin care. I have gotten a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> I have used this for the last three years and see a difference in my skin. And if you buy skin care products, you will realize its affordable.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. Every bit as good, well in fact the same, as the expensive one.  Keeps skin bright and smooth.  Little bit goes a long way.  You won&#x27;t regret it.  Seller (I&#x27;ve used them before) is fast and reliable.</li>
    <li> Originally I was looking for the skinceuticals C E Ferulic...but it was waaay too expensive for me.  So I thought I&#x27;d try the cosmetic skin solutions brand since it was well reviewed.  The shipment came quickly, 2-3 days, and the serum was completely clear (fresh!).  I use it every morning immediately after cleansing and you can immediately feel the pores tighten after applying the serum.  It&#x27;s a very runny and thin consistency, and absorbs into the skin wonderfully without leaving an oily residue (I have combination skin).  My friends have commented that my skin looks so much clearer and wonderful ever since I started using this serum.  And it&#x27;s only been one week!  I&#x27;ll definitely be a repeat customer!</li>
    <li> Really nice. Absorbs quickly. A tiny bit covers my face and neck and leaves my skin very soft and smooth.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Same contents as expensive mixture sold by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Best stuff on the market for treatment of aging skin and onset of wrinkles. Try it; you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It was a little effective but not near as much so as the plain Vitamin C for half the price I bought from the same company.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the other brand that sells for $175 and this worked just as well at a more reasonable price.</li>
    <li> One of the few cosmetic products I&#x27;ve purchased over and over. It makes a real difference!</li>
    <li> I purchased this serum and was very happy with the result.  I turned fifty this year and started seeing some damage to my skin including fine lines in my forehead.  This product has been very helpful.  The lines are now a lot less perceptible.  I am pretty happy.  SJL in New York City</li>
    <li> This product is great ! I&#x27;ve searched for years for the perfect product for my skin. It leaves my skin soft and smooth and spot free in only about 8 weeks. I highly recommend it !!! This product will always be a part of my daily beauty regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chasity_mississippi</li>
    <li> Excellent value and excellent product.  I am a former Skinceuticals user/buyer. I wanted something equally effective but with a more humane (yes humane) price tag.  After a little research and some questions I gave this a shot and I am now a loyal user.  The added bonus is that it is CRUELTY FREE and FDA approved.  It goes on a little sticky but very quickly absorbes and leaves no unpleasant feeling.  My skin looks fabulous and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for two years now and i can see as difference in my skin on my face  was recommended by my dermo.</li>
    <li> I am a return customer . my skins feel and look younger. I use Vitamin C+E Serum with Hydra B5 Gel .Its affordable price and great result as expensive brand.</li>
    <li> Nothing like Skinceuticals.  More water than oil.</li>
    <li> I used to buy the Skin Ceutical product at 4 times the price of the Cosmetic....and I&#x27;m happy I made the switch.  Not only it&#x27;s the same wonderful product, but I can now aford it.</li>
    <li> My skin wasn&#x27;t bad before purchasing this serum but I was looking for a way to help get rid of blemishes quicker and to stop them from happening. I would get intermittent zits around my chin but they were often large and painful. I&#x27;ve been using this product for two months and have noticed significantly fewer breakouts, they are smaller and more manageable, they go away within 1 day and don&#x27;t leave lasting color changes to my face. I only put if on at night but noticed a difference within 1-2 weeks, highly recommended and affordable!!</li>
    <li> I have been overhauling my skincare routine and bought quite a few new products.  This, and retinol, have proven to be the most effective of everything I purchased.  My skin was instantly smoother, pores reduced, and overall clearer when using the Vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ve all heard about the benefits of using  antioxidants on our skin. I&#x27;ve been doing it for some years now. Was a devoted Skinceuticals buyer-a great product- but the price point climbed &amp; became harder to justify. This product matches those ingredients and is provided in the same amounts. Thinking they aren&#x27;t identical, as you still see the Skinceuticals listed as the Cadillac product, but finding this to be a good substitute. One bottle lasts a long time. You apply once a day. I have very dry &amp; sensitive skin and it does not bother me. Tho I cannot point to a particular observable change as I&#x27;ve been using so long, I wouldn&#x27;t be without. Can be added to any skin care routine you are doing.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it! The elasticity and texture of my skin has improved and its quick absorption with no residue gives me the satisfaction that the serums I am putting on my face disappear without it having any residue. I have 7 products that I use from CSS and will always ensure I stock up and up! I shock people when I say I&#x27;m nearly 40... goodbye cheap products, Cosmetic Skin Solutions are here to stay in my house!</li>
    <li> A product review has been submitted for VITAMIN C+E SERUM ADVANCED FORMULA +.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love this product, amazing results from daily use. Sensational&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A product review has been submitted for HYDRA B5 GEL ADVANCED FORMULA +.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the texture and feel of B5 gel, makes my skin soft and supple. Thrilled with the results, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with the C + E Ferulic Acid Serum! It is an amazing product and I am a recent convert to Cosmetic Skin Solutions. I used to purchase SkinCeuticals serum for $150 until a beauty blog pointed out that Cosmetic Skin Solutions makes the same product for a fraction of the price. Cosmetic Skin Solutions serum is equal to if not better than SkinCeuticals and I am so glad that I switched!</li>
    <li> Love this product, use it religiously with my organic sunscreen. Fades spots and evens out my skin tone!! bit smelly but worth every cent!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before. It was recommended to me by a friend. It&#x27;s good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years. I have very sensitive skin but it works very well on my skin. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product and wouldn&#x27;t miss using it every morning.  I especially love the reasonable price compared to other brands I&#x27;ve seen available.</li>
    <li> Definitely comparable to the Skinceuticals brand.  I&#x27;ve used both and get the same results. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> So far it was ok. Haven&#x27;t seen any improvement, but it has only been a week since I started using it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Thanks for your service.</li>
    <li> I like this serum. Packaged in a dark bottle to keep it effectiveness longer with the Vitamin C. Eye dropper make it easy to use and absorbs and feels good on skin. Have been using it for about a month, with other anti aging products and do notice a difference in my skin and will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Have you ever said to yourself, &amp;#34;Oh, please, I just want my husband to lean in close and call me... hot dog face?&amp;#34;  Yeah, hot dog face.  This stuff smells so gross.  I feel like there has been a super slight improvement in my skin, but I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.  The smell is just too gross for this slight of an improvement.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist suggested adding a vitamin c product to my regimen. I&#x27;m not made of money though, and I went to Makeup Alley to find out what was affordable, but stable and the right Ph to actually work. Cosmetic Skin Solutions was the answer. This C + E serum has definitely improved the clarity, and the texture of my skin. I use it in the morning with the Resurfacing Serum and then use my sunscreen over them. I don&#x27;t ever want to be without these products!</li>
    <li> I prefer Cosmetic Skin Solutions over NuFountain Fresh Cosmetic because they list more clearly the ingredients: CE Ferulic Combination Antioxidant Treatment - 1 oz / 30 ml - Super Combination Antioxidant Formula - 15% Vitamin C, 1% Vitamin E, and 0.5% Ferulic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, prompt delivery. It was recommended to my by esthetician at my dermatologist&#x27;s office, and I think it had made a difference in my skin. I only use CeraVe foaming cleanser with my Clarisonic, this Cosmetic Skin Solutions CE Ferulic Combination Antioxidant Treatment  and CeraVe evening moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice a day for two months and see absolutely no improvement in fine lines or skin tone. I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties and could definitely use some help with those. The only difference I did see was very congested skin full of blackheads that also felt oily (I actually have somewhat dry skin). Got a facial and stopped using this stuff a week ago and my skin has finally cleared up. Can&#x27;t recommend this stuff, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I am now 62 and I started using this product in June 2012. When I started using it I had visible wrinkles above and below my lips.  Now that I&#x27;ve used it for a few years those wrinkles have almost entirely disappeared and also my skin is smoother.  I am ultrasensitive to cosmetics and luckily enough I have been able to use almost every single product in this line. I&#x27;m more than happy to recommend it as it is one of the better products I&#x27;ve tried in probably the last 15 years. I like to use this product in the morning first, then the B5 gel, then the Day Moisturizer. Mineral makeup goes on very well over this. This is a quality product and I don&#x27;t understand some of the comments that are negative.  I&#x27;ve had lots of experience using it and I can definitely say it is worth every penny (and it&#x27;s incredibly priced!).  I haven&#x27;t had the need to stray from this line so have used it consistently and gotten great results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cosmetic Skin Solutions Vitamin C+E serum combined with their Hydra B5 gel for a couple of years now and cannot recommend it highly enough. It makes a difference to my skin every day! Furthermore, any contact I have had with the company&#x27;s customer service has received courteous prompt attention. Go for it!</li>
    <li> He estado usando este serum for alrededor de un anho esta es mi tercera botella. Me encanta porque deja mi piel muy suave como s fuera piel de bebe. Me h dado mejores resultados que cualquier otra crema humectante. Se lo recomiendo a cualquier persona que tenga la piel extremadamente seca o sensible.</li>
    <li> I so love this C +E.  I don&#x27;t think you could find better and what a great price.  I have tried more expensive brands but ask myself why after finding this one.  My fine line have diminished and my skin is brighter and softer.  Love it!  And it you ever need customer service, Cosmetic Skin Solutions cant be beat.  I am a fan for life.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a couple months so, I can say it is working very well. The appearance of my skin is getting better in a short time! Most of the people says &amp;#34;You look very well&amp;#34; &amp;#34;You have a beautiful skin&amp;#34;. So this product is doing a great job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Cosmetic Skin Solutions&#x27; Vitamin C+E serum (15% Vitamin C, 1% Vitamin E, and 0.5% Ferulic Acid) for over a year now to reduce free radical-induced skin damage, particularly from ultraviolet light. I&#x27;m quickly approaching my thirties and my skin has held up pretty well thus far (knocks on wood). This product is also affordable compared to similar products, so high marks for that. I typically put it on beneath my sunscreen for optimal sun protection, and it does a good job of exfoliating my skin as well. I would recommend that new users or those with sensitive skin start with a lower Vitamin C concentration to reduce irritation and/or peeling, which I experienced when I went too high at first (20% Vitamin C). The product can also feel a bit sticky on your face after application, so I&#x27;d wait at least a half an hour if you plan on resting your head on a pillow. Nonetheless, I use this stuff religiously and it&#x27;s yet to disappoint; I don&#x27;t know what my skin would do without it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for several years. It is one of the best anti-aging products I have ever found. I recommend it to all of my friends and family. The ingredients were recommended to me by a plastic surgeon, and I found them at Cosmetic Skin Solutions.</li>
    <li> This product if great!  It&#x27;s a fraction of the price of similiar products out there, and it has the same result. I actually don&#x27;t think this one smells as bad as its expensive counterpart!</li>
    <li> The ingredients and amounts are the same as much more expensive serums.  I have had results just as good.</li>
    <li> Bought this product mainly for my pigmentation problems, after 1 week my face started breaking out in acne which I never had before, I still continue using it hoping maybe I will get some kinda results, after 6 weeks of getting up every morning to acne I finally decide to stop using it and must say my face has finally cleared up. Maybe I had an allergic reaction to it........</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the original Skinceuticals CE Ferulic serum with great results. When I ran out, I searched for a replacement and found Cosmetic Skin Solutions and thought what a bargain! I purchased this serum along with Hydra B5Gel and both solutions made my skin feel itchy and gave me slight reddish rash near by jawline. It didn&#x27;t give me the same results as Skinceuticals serum, which made my skin really glow and feel protected. I won&#x27;t be finishing the bottle and I&#x27;m going to repurchase the Skinceuticals.</li>
    <li> I found this skin treatment very easy to use and smooth to apply with my index and middle fingers. It not only lightened my dark spots but gave my facial skin more uniformity in shade. It was applied over my complete face and under my chin and on the back of my neck too. I am 84 was surprised that it helped noticeably to my sun damaged skin. I have not used any sunscreen or face products before but recommended it to my daughter and my girlfriend too. My girlfriend  is 87 and the dark spot on her temple is so faint now that you have to get real close to see it. I do that as often as I can.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this formula every morning. I got it a couple of weeks ago. I can&#x27;t notice a difference but other people have told me my skin looks great. I read reviews where people said that when the formula turns an orangeish color it isn&#x27;t safe to use. I put mine in the fridge (like some reviews suggested) and I recently noticed there were crystals on the dropper. Insight is greatly appreciated!</li>
    <li> I think it is working.</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I put this on a clean face followed by the Hydra B5 Gel and it provides a perfect surface to put make up on. Typical moisturizers leave me greasy but these serums never do. I also love that there are no fragrances added!</li>
    <li> I am 45 and have been a devotee of Skinceuticals C, E &amp; Ferulic for 10 years.  I get rave reviews about my skin...and I like that. What I don&#x27;t like is that the price of Skinceuticals has doubled over the past decade.  So, after much research, I tried this as a substitute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it now for about a month and I think that I like it.  It has all of the same ingredients, at the same levels as Skinceuticals, except the C is slightly higher.  It is in a dark glass bottle in order to keep it stable, the dropper works well, and it&#x27;s a substantial amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that I like it, except that my skin just started to get dry and very slightly irritated.  I just can&#x27;t determine if the dryness is due to the slightly higher levels of C...or my hormonal changes...or my new sunscreen.  Whatever the reason, I&#x27;m glad that I bought it and would recommend it to anyone else to try.  By the time I get to the bottom of the bottle, I will know if it&#x27;s worth a re-purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other serums but this one works for my skin.  It protects my skin from further damage and gives me a smooth complexion.</li>
    <li> Smells strong oh alcohol and doesn&#x27;t give me results as other serums I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> Amazing quality vitamin c, have ordered many times and each time am thrilled with the results.</li>
    <li> An excellent product-rivals those that are more than double the cost. I Highly recommend it. At first I was suspicious because of the excellent value but it seems to be the genuine article!</li>
    <li> I am Loving this Serum! I usually don&#x27;t write that many reviews but I felt I needed to express my satisfaction with the Serum.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is glowing!  I can&#x27;t wait to try their other serums.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for dry skin.  I tried it on my mom who is in her mid 60&#x27;s and has Very Dry skin.  It instantly improved her skin!!! I am ordering her a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;My Skin Type:  Combination skin (oily on the T-zone area).  Prone to hormonal breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Serum Pros:  It made my skin even toned!  Glow/Hydrated.  Red acne scar seems lighter.  Serum is Not Oily. It seems like my skin drinks it right up.  I am really Happy with my Purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to update my comment in about a month to see if the product continues to work.</li>
    <li> I tried this formula without the Vitamin E and it irritated the skin on my neck.  This one with the E added is perfect. My melasma has faded and would probably fade more if I also did lactic acid peels.  I use this at night or under a broad spectrum  50 sunblock.</li>
    <li> I am hooked on this product AND company!  They make top notch, pure facial products.  The Vit C+E, 0.5% ferulic acid and hyaluronic acid. I use this product every morning with my facial routine. I apply it on freshly washed, dry skin, then apply moisturizer. It gives my face a fresh, glow.  Help smooth out fine lines around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I love the benefits of the Vit C+E along with Ferulic acic and Hyaluronic acids. Ferulic acid, which plays a key role in self preservation, re-enforcing skin cell strength and protecting it from microbial damage as well as sun damage, Hyaluronic acid helps plump the skin, giving the appearance of smooth skin, by improving texture AND plumping out those fine lines. I wish I knew now at age 37 as I did when I was 17.  I would have avoided the skin the the plague, instead of damaging it but wanting to be tan all the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Skinceuticals C E Ferulic serum for years but the price has skyrocketed!  When looking for a better price for the Skinceuticals product, I found this   product at a much better price and decided to try it.  I&#x27;m very happy that I did.  The product seems to be a little lighter than the Skinceuticals one, but it also doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on my skin.  The results are equal to the more expensive product too!  I&#x27;m going to recommend this to my friend who also used the Skinceuticals.  Why pay so much more when you can have this great product at a fraction of the cost???</li>
    <li> Using as directed, i haven&#x27;t noticed any change in the texture, tone or smoothness  of my skin... yet another product that over promises and under delivers</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product through about 2 years with few switches--one 1oz bottle lasts me 4-6 weeks depending on whether my fiance remembers to use it too.  I use it mornings after washing my face, layered under euro sunscreens like Bioderma PhotoMax Lait with high PPD.  This CSS product boosts the sun-protective power of the sunscreen and provides a layer of antioxidant protection on my skin from pollution, oxidizing makeup, and (unfortunately) smokers in my area.  I like it more than the Skinceuticals because I can be more liberal with it--using it on more of my body because it is more affordable.  Ultimately, I think time is the most important element--if the product begins to oxidize, I don&#x27;t want to use it, so there is no sense in buying Skinceuticals and stretching out its use over more weeks to save money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used ph strips to test several of these bottles over the 2 years and they have all been under 3.5, which is required for absorption into the skin.  Since not everyone has ph strips to test each bottle they use, I strongly hope CSS quality control keeps every single bottle of this product at a PH that is only slightly higher than the patent-protected ph that Skinceuticals has for its own CE Ferulic formulation, and most certainly below 3.5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, every bottle I&#x27;ve received has been 100% clear.  If yours has oxidized somewhat, please feel free to ask for an exchange even if companies insist that the product is still more than 96% effective after some color change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is iffy.  I once had a package of this product stolen from my apartment building and customer service would not send another one until multiple emails and many days had passed where my skin had no LAA serum to protect it in the hot summer sun.  They wanted me to find the package even though several weeks had passed during a particularly hot month when the serum would&#x27;ve undoubtedly oxidized in the heat and time lapse.  When I mentioned thisto customer service, they were not initially responsive until I said that I was such a loyal repeat customer and that I had lost patience with this process.  Finally they sent another bottle quickly, but not without really annoying me first and sending me to investigate other options such as Cellbone and Timeless&#x27; new non-MAP formulation of CE Ferulic.</li>
    <li> I started using this serum about a week ago and so far I&#x27;m pleased with the product. When I use it my skin seems to be firmer and I also like the fact that it provides antioxidents.</li>
    <li> I really like this product!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay...not great and smells unpleasant. didn&#x27;t notice any changes in my skin.</li>
    <li> I have never bought the $130 CE Ferulic, but yes, the ingredients are EXACTLY the same. I do love the way it has improved my face texture over time, though! I have been using it abt three times a week during my nighttime skincare regimen, and I do like the results!</li>
    <li> I was using the iSclinical advanced serum (also a high potency vitamin C elixir essentially) and went to Amazon to order a fresh bottle when the urge to NOT spend so much money on face care overtook me and I decided to &amp;#34;dig a little deeper&amp;#34; for options. Thats when I found Cosmetic Skin Solutions.  I was skeptical and read I think every single review I could find, the good bad and ugly. Surprisingly there wasn&#x27;t much out there in terms of negative reviews at all, in fact you will notice most reviews are quite positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with this product has been quite good. I find it absorbs very well. I have a dry, sensitive skin- I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties and I have been a smoker on and off for about 12 years. I quit again recently (please god for good) and am on a mission to help repair my skin, and at the least protect it going forward.  This isnt a MIRACLE serum my any means, just as the iSclinical, and Skinceuticals aren&#x27;t miracles either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have noticed is improved texture, and a firming effect. Using this alone will prove to dry, definitely get a moisturizer to follow and I can put this all over my face, but some people may find it to intense around the thinner eye skin. I rub it on my neck and shoulders where I have some sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I give this five stars - for the price do yourself a favor and start protecting your skin and repairing some of the damage caused over the years with this high quality vitamin C serum. What do you have to loose? (PS_ PLEASE CSS DON&#x27;T EVER RAISE YOUR PRICES!!!)</li>
    <li> This seems like an ok serum. I have two problems with it. It&#x27;s a little pricey and it tends to turn rancid before half way through the bottle. They really should sell this in smaller bottles for half the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fairly happy with this product, time will tell.</li>
    <li> I have used Cosmetic Solution products for several years now and love them.  I highly recommend trying them out.  My skin glows and feels healthy and soft and my smile lines are much less pronounced.  They are not gone, after all I smile a bunch, but there is much improvement.  I use the combo CE Ferulic Combo antioxidant treatment, along with B5 Hydra as well as the eye gel.  Try it.  You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy! For a concentrated Vit C! Very runny of course....but the results are worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again!</li>
    <li> Have also been putting on the tops of my hands in an attempt to minimize collagen loss there as well.</li>
    <li> I have used Skinceuticals&#x27; serum for 3 years but to economize I bought Cosmetic Skin Solution&#x27;s serum thinking it would be similar. However, to my disappointment I have found it is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Color: Skinceuticals&#x27; serum is always slightly amber which yes, shows oxidation of the vitamin C. CSS&#x27;s product was completely clear, which immediately made me suspicious. If a major corporation such as L&#x27;Oreal (which owns Skinceuticals) cannot stabilize their vitamin C, how can this smaller company (subject to less checks and balances) achieve that at this price?&lt;br /&gt;* Consistency: Skinceuticals&#x27; serum is slightly oily and has the advantage of offering a bit of moisturizing, whereas CSS serum is completely watery and it actually dries my skin.&lt;br /&gt;* Smell: Skinceuticals&#x27; serum smells like a hot dog boiled in Vietnamese fish sauce, which is slightly unpleasant but I had learned to get used to it. This product had virtually NO smell at all. Other customers have complained about the smell which makes me wonder - was my batch different?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old adage &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; seems to be true when it comes to CSS&#x27;s product.  I will not repurchase as my instinct makes me very suspicious of this product. It feels like I am just applying water to my face.</li>
    <li> Great product. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several months and believe it is an essential step to maintaining good skin tone &amp; texture. I am 42, but my skin looks younger. Great step in protecting your skin from free radicals. Is not oily or greasy. Looks like water, but goes on like a serum. Only need a few drops. One bottle lasts me a few months (5 drops in the am). Then the liquid starts to turn an orangly/yellow color which means the Vit c is oxidizing. Good thing it happens near the bottom of the bottle! Keep it tightly sealed and out of direct sunlight. I keep it under my sink. The price is great too, compared to other Vit. c serums!</li>
    <li> I received a different item then the one advertised. I ordered the Vitamin C+E serum but I received the Resurfacing Serum which is a very different product and less expensive. I guess I&#x27;m going to give it a try and ignore the fact that I spent more money for a cheaper product.</li>
    <li> I love it and continue to use it</li>
    <li> This skin product seems to work better than most and was recommended by my skin specialist. Much better value ordered through Amazon. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I originally bought a combination pack of almost all the serums and gels. Before I ordered, I requested an ingredients list of all their Vitamin C serums, since they didn&#x27;t have it on their web site yet, to compare the ingredients to Skinceuticals and just for my information so I know what&#x27;s in it. They promptly sent me one and I was VERY pleased with the ingredients and  how they compared to Skinceuticals. They are virtually the same only Cosmetic Skin Solutions is WAY more affordable!!!!!  After trying the Vitamin C serums, I am very happy with those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Vitamin C Serums for a while, they started to get darker and darker. It had been a long time since I bought them when I emailed Cosmetic Skin Solutions to ask if it was ok to use them still. I received a prompt reply the next day in my email account telling me that the Vitamin C serums have a shelf life of about 6 months and was told NOT to use them after that and definitely not when they have become oxidized and are turning darker. I was told that it is best to use a fresh batch for no more than about 6 months. I was using all 3 of them at the same time and had only gone through about half of each. Since I bought the more than $200 package and because I was unaware of the shelf life, they told me they would send me 3 fresh bottles to replace the ones that had gone bad! I had hoped for something like that but I didn&#x27;t even ask because I just didn&#x27;t think they would really do that. They offered to do it for me!!!!!!!! I have to say that in a world of good customer service becoming a rarity, I am SOOOOOO happy with Cosmetic Skin Solutions not only for their wonderful products but also for their OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Thank you CSS!!!  :)</li>
    <li> This product has been a game-changer! I did a lot of research on different Vitamin C serums before purchasing, and this serum had great reviews and a fantastic price point. I was also very impressed with the company&#x27;s emphasis on the science behind their products. (Their website includes an entire section, \\&quot;About the Science.\\&quot;)    I am prone to acne and clogged pores and have a lot of hyperpigmentation because of it. I bought this mainly to help with the pigmentation, and it has delivered! The pigmentation has significantly faded, and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has improved in evenness and texture since using the Vitamin C+E serum. The formula is also very elegant -- it immediately absorbs into the skin and is not sticky. I wear it under sunscreen and makeup during the day, and put it on at night before moisturizing.    I&#x27;m very impressed with the product and will continue repurchasing!</li>
    <li> I started using this on July 15, 2014 and just used the last of it on October 11, 2014.... so three months of almost daily, moderate use.  It never changed color like others have reported.  It did start crusting on the rim of the bottle with white stuff.  It does stink, but not too bad - I got used to it and my moisturizer/sunscreen covered the smell (I hope - my husband never said anything).  I felt like it did help the tone/evenness of my skin a bit, but the biggest question I have is, is it really blocking free radicals and preventing pre-mature ageing?  I guess I won&#x27;t know, right?  So am I still wondering if I should re-order it.  Is it really as effective as Skin Ceuticals?????</li>
    <li> I liked the product! It is exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I am 43 years old, always get compliments on my skin even from younger women. The problem I have with this product is how quickly it oxidizes. To be fair I waited until my second bottle to give a proper review. Too much product in the bottle, half of it goes to waste. The first bottle I kept on the restroom vanity so it was exposed to light. The second bottle I kept it stored away in a drawer and sealed tight, it still oxidized fast. Im not getting my moneys worth, other than that great results on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have used the Vitamin C+E Serum in my daily skin routine for several years now, after reading about it on the FutureDerm blog.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the the results. And you can&#x27;t beat the price point compared to similar serums on the market.</li>
    <li> I had a facial at a spa which used this product.  I loved the way it made my face glow and helped to reduce wrinkles around my eyes.  The problem is the expense of the product.  I now am using C+E Ferulic Antioxidant Serum from [...].which I found here.  It is the SAME product used in the spas but at a more afortable cost. My order arrived in three days. I am very pleased with their service as well as the serum.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a more youthful face!    Margie from Florida</li>
    <li> I’ve been using vitamin C serum for about 2 years and must say CSS Vitamin C+E Serum is the best I’ve ever used! I use it every morning and I see great results. My skin is brighter, firmer and, I believe, very well protected from environmental pollutants and UV radiation. Great value for money as well. Will definitely keep repurchasing this one and after trying samples I’m planning to buy full sizes of other products. Well done CSS!</li>
    <li> I previously used the Skinseutical version of this product and I like this product much better.  It&#x27;s lighter in texture and works every bit as well as the much higher priced Skinseutical product.  I also noticed that the Cosmetic Skin Solutions product lasted longer before changing color and becoming inactive.  I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Great product always arrives fresh and fast. It works just make sure you wait about five minutes after applying it before you put on your moisterizer.</li>
    <li> Consistent product, and service.&lt;br /&gt;A regular part of my skin regimen for years. Wish the company would address the negative reports of the PH litmus test that does NOT support their claims??? That is a hard fact needing their attention for those of us looking at their # 1, more expensive, competitor&#x27;s similar product! I for one would like to know their response!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried some of the more expensive brands, but this is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my face!</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this serum after putting on my daily moisturizer in the morning. I follow a simple regimen so to not put too many skin products on my face at one time. So, I keep it simple: wash face, apply toner, put on moisturizer, follow with antioxidant treatment. I simply love this product. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Skin care: I expected this product to be sub par because it is approx. 1/4 of the cost of its competitor. It has exceeded my expectations. I heard it has a bad smell. It certainly does not. The color of the liquid is clearer than the other product.Time will tell the effects but so far so good. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product contains Hydroquinone, in small amounts, but it blew my face up while on vacation. After my face swelling like a blow fish I found it on the box and I knew I couldn&#x27;t use products with this. Yep, it was right on the box, but did not disclose this on the web. I am not going to hassle with the company due to a review that states they aren&#x27;t user friendly. I am going to give it to my Mom. But I waited a long time to afford this, and I a sorely disappointed that this was not disclosed. I guess I will use the more expensive stuff or just move on. Next time I am going to call companies to make sure this isn&#x27;t \\&quot;hidden\\&quot; in the mix. If your face swells, you might have the same problem I do. After I stopped using it in three days I had cheek bones again!! If someone from the co. wants to make this right for me, please do so.</li>
    <li> Everyone should have this product in their home for; men, and women alike.&lt;br /&gt;I am 49 years old, and when people guess my age they say; 31 to 35 years old! now that&amp;#34; makes me happy, and it&#x27;s all due to this prduct!&lt;br /&gt;A plastic surgeon tried to sell this product to me for 300.00!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;So&amp;#34; I asked for a sample instead, it was a very small bottle that lasted me six months, then I just read what was on the label, then typed it into Amazon, and found it, thank God!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt; And thank you Amazon!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This is a must have!!!!!! I cannot stress enough how amazing this product is&lt;br /&gt;  Sincerely yours Jennifer Marciano&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS you &amp;#34;don&#x27;t need&amp;#34; a plastic surgeon for a facelift when you use this product!!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and better than the higherpriced version</li>
    <li> I usually go to the dermatologist every 6 months to have my skin checked due to my high risk factors for skin cancer. I thought I would have a different pair of eyes look me over so I went to a plastic surgeon one time. While I was there I asked for recommendations for my face &amp; neck (I don’t want to end up with turkey neck some day either). He recommended an expensive brand of C + E serum that was sold in his office. I didn’t buy it at that time because I wanted to think it over &amp; do some research of my own. I came across Cosmetic Skin Solutions while surfing the web; it was suggested on Skin Care Talk forum. The price was MUCH MORE reasonable than the well-known brand and the ingredients are similar. I can’t compare the two brands because I’ve never tried the other brand, but I can say that I am very pleased with the results of the Cosmetic Skin Solutions C + E Serum, Advanced Formula. The price is reasonable &amp; the company offers discounts periodically. They also do not charge excessively high shipping fees. I have been purchasing this item for a few years now &amp; plan to continue to do so in the future (provided the price doesn’t take a sharp turn upwards).  I also find myself recommending it to others. I also found their customer service to be very helpful too. I was told that after I put the drops of the serum in my palm that I should finger tighten the cropper back on the bottle (until my hands are free &amp; can properly tighten it. This helps to prevent air from getting to the product &amp; lowering the integrity of it. (I thought I should add that the next time I went to my dermatologist for a skin check I saw advertisements for the more expensive brand. Hmmmm, must be a pretty good product to use, but why spend more if you don’t have to ☺)</li>
    <li> I have bought this serum 5 or 6 times already, because I absolutely LOVE it! It is exactly the same as the $100+ serum, but for way better value. I have found that it made my skin glow, made it brighter, and made it smoother. I use this every night and every morning. I use it in the morning as a an extra sunscreen under my liquid sunscreen, and I use it at night for its antioxidant properties. CSS, please never discontinue making this!</li>
    <li> I will never use another product on my face again! My Mom gave me a sample of another company&#x27;s vitamin C &amp; E product to try and I was shocked at the immediate results I got. When I went to order it online I was shocked again - at the price! Then I searched for an alternative and found Cosmetic Skin Solutions. I ordered the Advanced Vitamin C &amp; E Serum and got the EXACT same results. Since then I&#x27;ve used several of their products and have been nothing but satisfied. The customer service is incredible! Great company, awesome products!</li>
    <li> I love the product.  My wife says I am a product junkie but this is one product I keep coming back to.  Just as good as Skinceuticals product .  Would easily recommend</li>
    <li> This product has made a clear difference on my skin!  In spite of the creams and masks I use, my skin looked dull and tired.  I tried using self tanning hoping to get a bit of a glow with very little success.  I ran into this  product while researching on line and ordered it at Amazon because the price was much lower than other sites.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and I cannot believe the difference on my skin, it looks so smooth and it has a youthful, healthy glow,</li>
    <li> I have been using skinceuticals for years spending 2x the money that I paid for similar products as these I ordered from Amazon. I would recommend this to my daughter and grandaughters.</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing.  In two weeks time all my hyperpigmention has almost disappeared completely.  My skin has a glow that it hasn&#x27;t had for a long time.  I spend a lot of money on face creams (mostly Clinique) and this is the best product I have ever purchased.  I don&#x27;t even need foundation now! I will never be without this product!</li>
    <li> I purchase  this product instead of skinceuticals, it is much less expensive and I feel it works just as well.</li>
    <li> Like others, and after reading reviews, I went for this $40 product instead of replacing a $100+ SkinCeuticals C&amp;E Ferulic that I had purchased from my dermatologist. The Cosmetic Twin Solutions product is watery and more acidic. Because I had both, I used one for a week and then the other for a time. The SkinCeuticals formula feels bette on my skin. This one is drying and slightly burning.  The recommended application is just 4-5 drops so an ounce lasts a LONG time! When I finally ran completely out of the SkinCeuticals bottle, I decided to pay the price and get the real thing.</li>
    <li> I have used this for over 4 years and would not be without it.  I actually like better than others I have tried.  Easy to use, absorbs quickly and the results are outstanding.  Living in Florida it is that extra punch your skin needs.</li>
    <li> I used to pay big bucks for Epicuren products, but after using Cosmetic Skin Solutions products, I am happy with their quality and their reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I was so pleased to try this product for the lower dollar amount than the leading SS brand. It&#x27;s a very good quality product, seems to look and feel and work the exact same way. I have since bought many other products from Cosmetic Skin Solutions. I trust them.</li>
    <li> CE and Ferulic is a great combination for any skin. This particular product arrived in great condition (clear liquid - no discoloration). It stings a bit when applied to the face - that means that it&#x27;s working!</li>
    <li> My item arrived very quickly, packaged well and undamaged.So far, the serum is as described by the manufacturer. It is too soon to tell its effectiveness, but early results are good. I would recommend this product to anyone with facial lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This review is just as much about the customer service as it is about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered this serum twice and I noticed that there was a slight irregularity in the product (mostly the color).  I wrote Cosmetic Skin Solutions and within hours I&#x27;d received a reply from their customer service apologizing for any uncertainty and they promptly shipped off a new product to me.  I&#x27;d previously fallen victim to a fake product bought thru Amazon, and this type of customer service is what separates the good companies from the great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now and like it.  It feels good on the skin but it is still too early to see how it performs on wrinkles.  I&#x27;ll be back in a few weeks to let you know how that goes!</li>
    <li> This serum is wonderful.  It contains the exact same ingredients that two very expensive serums contain.  Plus, it&#x27;s non-irritating.  I have tried those expensive serums and I had a lot of irritation.  Not with this one - no need to spend more  $$.  I will definitively continue to order this product.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> stinky stinky stinky. No visible results were received by me. I used the entire bottle with hope to see change, but only saw improvement once I stopped using.</li>
    <li> A lot cheaper than the &amp;#34;other brand&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve tried.  It seems like it works as well.</li>
    <li> This serum is the best! I&#x27;ve tried others and this is the one i am sticking to!</li>
    <li> It is amazing the results that I got in over 6 months. people tell me that I look younger but they do not excatly why... they look at me at ask me if I had botox done,or filler injected...They cannot believe it just your creams/serums!!!!</li>
    <li> Este producto es de buena calidad, practicamente es un regalo para la piel, sobre todo despues de una esfoliacion profunda.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, haven been using it for 9 months and friends and family have notice my skin has improved a lot. I could see my pores have became much smaller. Highly recommend this product..</li>
    <li> I thought about buying this product for a long time and read a lot of reviews before I ended up purchasing it. I am so happy I did! I am younger so I am not looking for the anti aging benefits, I was needing the skin smoothing, and that is exactly what it has done. My skin has not looked so even and blemish free in years, I am seriously excited about this product and would recommend it to anyone who is wary!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using it now for about a month and have noticed a difference in my skin. My skin tone has evened out, blemishes are almost gone, my face is more firm and tight. I love it!</li>
    <li> easy to use. gives sour taste to my skin- so no kissing after  that - lol - but I think I like it .</li>
    <li> After two months of using it, I am convinced this is not as effective as the Skinceuticals version, which is the first skin product I&#x27;ve ever used that actually seemed to make my skin look better. By rights, the effect should be the same because the ingredients are essentially the same, but I do believe there is a difference. Even if I&#x27;m crazy and the Skinceuticals is not as effective as I think, I saw no difference with this. Maybe my skin was already in good shape. But I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see a big difference in my skin. I plan to continue to use it . Hopefully by the end of the bottle,I will notice a difference.;)</li>
    <li> I saw this product on another beauty advice website and thought I&#x27;d try it. You will definitely see result in a week or so. I use this daily under moisturizer and then follow with my foundation. It diminishes the appearance of wrinkles and the skin just looks better.</li>
    <li> Identical to skinceuticals?! Not even close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super disappointed. Definitely not as high quality. It&#x27;s watery and therefore difficult to apply. How do you apply something the consistency of water to your face? I felt that I needed to write this review to keep other people from having this experience. If you can&#x27;t get skinceuticals, go for the PCA CE. I&#x27;m keeping this er, #1 stuff in my gym bag and slowly trying to use it up (I now punish myself for buying products by making myself use them).</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference in the clarity of my skin within a couple of weeks.  Some of the discoloration in my skin lightened, and it absorbs quickly into my skin.  Will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to take a minute and say how great this serum is! I never used the Skinceuticals version due to exorbitant cost, so I can&#x27;t comment on their similarity, but the ingredients are EXACTLY the same. I find the quality of this product to be very high, and as a nurse that works in dermatology that says a lot, as I&#x27;m incredibly picky about my products. It is one of the few products that I feel actually does what it claims. My skin glows after I apply it, and I do think it&#x27;s helping to fade the few lentigines I have on my nose from sun exposure. I am primarily using it to prevent future sun and environmental damage, but I have been impressed with the results I&#x27;ve seen in the relatively short time I&#x27;ve been using it as well. I&#x27;m almost finished with my first bottle, and I fully intend to continue purchasing it. I hope they never stop making this and please tell all your friends if you like it as much as I do &#x3D;)  UPDATE: Still highly recommend this product, but wanted to offer a few suggestions in extending the longevity of the product. The more you expose your bottle to air/light, the more quickly it will oxidize (turn yellow). I do continue to use mine until it&#x27;s a light yellow, but toss it when it starts getting brighter. I now store my bottle in the refrigerator (and in it&#x27;s box), which greatly extends product life. I have a little glass dropper bottle, and I fill it up from the big bottle and use that each day. That way, I&#x27;m only opening the big bottle once every 2 weeks instead of daily. Before doing it this way I was getting frustrated because the serum would turn yellow when there was still half a bottle left, but this has really worked for me. Great product!!</li>
    <li> I have been using another similar more expensive product until now. I have been happy with this product even though I notice a more alcohol smell. My skin is continuing to improve and I am more than happy with the costs.</li>
    <li> This product works good and has my face looking a few years younger, like 10. I am so happy I found this. It life saver. Think you can find a cheaper option on Amazon.com somewhere. Check my other reviews.</li>
    <li> “Awesome serum with a great price! I have been using this serum for more than a year now having switched from a more expensive brand. I love how it plumps up my face, lessens the appearance of pigmentation and moisterises my skin. I have bought for my mum and daughter as well. Can&#x27;t live without this serum!!”</li>
    <li> “Just love this product. Really good for my skin. Service excellent, reliable and fast. Thanks!”</li>
    <li> My facialist recommended the Skinceutical version of this but Cosmetic Skin Solution is every bit as good.  Use it daily and my skin is holding up quite well.</li>
    <li> Great delivery...product as expected</li>
    <li> I have used this  Vitamin C  + E serum  product for many years and find it excellent to keep skin youthful</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for! Not all that great in comparason to the original</li>
    <li> I love the Vitamin C 20% Serum + Ferulic Acid &amp; Hyaluronic Acid from CSS so I thought that since this is a closer dupe to the skinceuticals original Vitamin C serum I&#x27;d like this as well. Unfortunately it breaks me out, I was startled since the 20% serum doesn&#x27;t, maybe it&#x27;s the vitamin e oil? Either way, I&#x27;d recommend the other one for acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of CSS Vit C&amp;E and I love it because it makes my skin texture look more refined and smoother. I also ordered for my mother and daughter because I am convinced of its benefits.</li>
    <li> Im an Esthetician who would like to carry this product line in my Spa.I had an issue with a broken bottle upon delivery and the company sent me a new bottle with no problem.They were friendly and provided prompt service.I will be ordering the entire product line.The Vit C+E serum and the 20% vit C serum is fantastic.I think I&#x27;ve used every product line out there and this is by far &#x27;THE BEST&#x27;...Will be a life time fan.Please try-its worth every cent.</li>
    <li> great serum and it does not leave you feeling greasy.  The results of softer skin happens very quickly and love it.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product!! I have been using for a few months and it has changed my skin dramatically!! I had brown spots from sun damage and they are almost invisible. The smaller spots are 100% gone and the larger spots are barely there. I am sure within the next few weeks the larger ones will be gone completely. My skin tone is brighter and smoother and I just cant say enough about this serum. I also use the Hydra B5 Gel for added moisture. I love Cosmetic Skin Solutions!!</li>
    <li> This one seems to offer the most for the least amount of money.  An excellent product.  My facial clinician and my dermatologist think this is great also.</li>
