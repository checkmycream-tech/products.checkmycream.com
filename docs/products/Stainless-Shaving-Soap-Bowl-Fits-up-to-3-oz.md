      <li>This is a nice sized stainless bowl that fits well in the hand and is ideal for use with tube type shave cream.</li>
      <li>guys, most shave soaps (and their containers)</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>It is not the most elegant piece in my collection</li>
      <li>and will enjoy this product and enjoy a good shaving experience</li>

      <li>what more can you ask for?</li>
      <li>I love it...</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really soak a brush in it but very nice for making lather in.</li>
      <li>very nice fast shipping , does it was design to do.</li>
      <li>I purchased this through Amazon prime, this attractive bowl was very reasonably priced, and shipping was free.</li>
      <li>Also, the smooth surface doesn&#x27;t help to create a good lather quickly.</li>
      <li>Looks great, fits nicely in your palm and holds more than enough lather for shaving.</li>
      <li>I bought a beautiful  chrome shaving stand with brush and razor from Amazon and wanted a soap dish to complete the set as a B&#x27;day gift for a close friend.</li>
      <li>The Shaving Soap lathers up nicely in hear and its easy to keep clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cleaning up is also very nice; I use hot water and remove the soap from the dish temporarily while I clean out the bowl.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m enjoy shaving more now</li>
      <li>Im not even shure wheather if most shaveing soap puck will fit.</li>
      <li>it looks good and works very well the one I got</li>
      <li>It also would have rusted very quickly.</li>
      <li>Easy to hold while making lather</li>
      <li>What I end up doing is run extremely hot water in the sink and fill it with hot water and let it sit for about 2 minutes; then dump out the water (keep the water in the sink) and lather up the soap; this allows for a nice warm shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A mug would work just fine.</li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the quality of the bowl.</li>
      <li>easy to clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well made and attractive, but it&#x27;s tiny.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Cheap glue.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the bowl for a while and find the size shape to be very useful.  </li>
      <li>I really liken shaving the old fashioned way and this cup is very nice.</li>
      <li>It is about 3 inches across the top of the bowl, so not too large.</li>
      <li>After raising a stink the seller did issue me a full credit</li>
      <li>This bowl is well designed -- right shape, right size, and attractive enough to leave out all the time.</li>
      <li>He has been using it now for a month (daily) and the finish is still fine and when clean is good as new.</li>
      <li>Nice looking and nice feeling, but too small for my bowl lathers.</li>
      <li>Pretty much straightforward review here</li>
      <li>It looks pretty on my counter too!</li>
      <li>This is a cheap very lightweight tin bowl that you can buy for a dollar at the Flea Market.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just questioning if it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>Would be a five star rating but the bowl gets pretty got when filled with hot water.</li>
      <li>Will work nicely with a smaller sized brush.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and big.</li>
      <li>Maybe my fault for not checking the size but other than that it has a nice build to it and doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
      <li>Love the classic design and the stainless steel is a must-have.</li>
      <li>Just the right size &amp; weight.</li>
      <li>Very easy to clean and never loses its shine even after multiple cleanings.</li>
      <li>This bowl is great ergonomically, and my shaving soap container fits right in, but it&#x27;s priced a little high for something that could be handled with a widemouthed coffee mug.</li>
      <li>It might be a bit pricey but all in all I like it very much.</li>
      <li>plus it is easy to clean and is large enough to hold the soap.</li>
      <li>He really enjoys this along with the Luxury Shaving Gift Set I purchased for him!</li>
      <li>It is exactly what it says it is.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a simple and elegant product.</li>
      <li>My only suggestion would be to put a bit more weight into the bottom.</li>
      <li>Not big enough to work up a good lather.</li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that since it is stainless steel it doesn&#x27;t keep the lather warm for more than a few seconds.</li>
      <li>It stated it was a certain size</li>
      <li>I have a matching cup for my soap and the two really add style to my shaving kit.</li>
      <li>use a pewter shaving bowl which is very ornate to make the lather.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another thing about this is, it is steel (stainless), so it conducts heat.  </li>
      <li>Does the job very well.  </li>
      <li>and he really likes it</li>
      <li>But definitely won&#x27;t fit the larger ones unless you want to bang it up.  </li>
      <li>The residue from used soap washes off completely with the hot water</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Looks great, fits nicely in your palm and holds more than enough lather for shaving. nicely paired with escali brush and razor stand</li>
    <li> Does what its supposed to do well. what more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> perfect size for any brush, width and depth.  and i just like the way it looks, well made.  easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I bought my husband an entire double edged razor shaving set for Christmas. He has always used the traditional seven blade disposable razors and I took a chance and put together a new kit for him. This shaving bowl was part of that kit. It is exactly what it says it is. A chrome shaving bowl. It is shiny and a nice size for lathering up. It is about 3 inches across the top of the bowl, so not too large. It looks nice sitting on the bathroom vanity. He has been using it now for a month (daily) and the finish is still fine and when clean is good as new.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and big. Can&#x27;t really soak a brush in it but very nice for making lather in. I would buy this product again</li>
    <li> I like the size of the dish. I would recommend this product to everyone. I have no complaints. Easy to hold while making lather</li>
    <li> I have not seen the bowl so can only report secondhand.  This was a gift along with other shaving items.  He liked it and reported no issues at all.</li>
    <li> Works really well to hold my soap, the chrome does get dirty with every use but what do you expect from a soap bowl?</li>
    <li> The bowl is what I wanted so I&#x27;m happy about that. Ordered it around Christmas so I expected a delay....there was one. Simply Beautiful made up for it in fine fashion though so you can be confident that you won&#x27;t get messed over if there&#x27;s a mixup. I also want to add that the other 4-5 products in that order came in just fine.  Everyone makes mistakes.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00BCNCKBQ SimplyBeautiful Deluxe Chrome Shaving Bowl for Shaving Soap]] it looks good on my bathroom counter and the bowl is a perfect size for my shaving soap. I purchased this through Amazon prime, this attractive bowl was very reasonably priced, and shipping was free.</li>
    <li> I like this bowl it looks good and works very well the one I got looked good and works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the bowl for a while and find the size shape to be very useful.  The grip allows you to hold the bowl easily and firmly.  Fits a variety of soap sizes.  It is not the most elegant piece in my collection but it does the job nicely and it is not overpriced/</li>
    <li> Really Nice Looking, Durable Shaving cup. The Shaving Soap lathers up nicely in hear and its easy to keep clean. I really liken shaving the old fashioned way and this cup is very nice.</li>
    <li> The cup was welded off kilter from the base.  Polish was uneven. Im not even shure wheather if most shaveing soap puck will fit.</li>
    <li> This bowl is well designed -- right shape, right size, and attractive enough to leave out all the time. My only suggestion would be to put a bit more weight into the bottom.</li>
    <li> Pretty much straightforward review here guys, most shave soaps (and their containers) will fit perfectly into this bowl. It added a nice manly touch to the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I bought a beautiful  chrome shaving stand with brush and razor from Amazon and wanted a soap dish to complete the set as a B&#x27;day gift for a close friend. After extensive shopping I chose this one thinking as it was described on the product page that it would be a high quality match for the set. It is NOT. This is a cheap very lightweight tin bowl that you can buy for a dollar at the Flea Market. When I received the item I picked up the box and it felt like there was nothing inside. AND the dimensions listed are not accurate either. This is a small bowl that could not even fit a 3oz shaving puck. After raising a stink the seller did issue me a full credit and I wound up returning the shaving stand as well as I decided to buy something else.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a simple and elegant product. I&#x27;m got tired of the disposable razor blade model and shifted to buying a nice set with a few hundred razors replacements. I&#x27;m enjoy shaving more now and I&#x27;m never going back to disposable blades.</li>
    <li> Product dimensions state 4x4x4&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is barely 2.5&amp;#34; tall, and less than 3.5&amp;#34; diameter at the top, with the top inside diameter being only 3.25 inches and the bottom of the bowl diameter being barely 2&amp;#34;...  I have a smallish badger brush and this bowl still looks tiny with it.  Just too small for a comfortable bowl lather in my opinion, and I don&#x27;t know how they got 4x4x4 inches...  It didn&#x27;t even come in a box, so it clearly isn&#x27;t the packaging dimensions either.  It was just thrown in, with one square of bubble wrap inside a large box with the other items I ordered from Amazon.  Pretty disappointed for $20.00 for an incorrectly listed tiny bowl.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item along with a safety razor and brush.  Happy with the purchase - makes a beautiful set.  Will never go back to disposable razors again.  Good quality bowl with a nice look.  Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Was a great gift to give the man in my life!  He couldn&#x27;t wait to use it and add to his shaving collection.</li>
    <li> Always wanted to shave this way.  Now I am.  I love it...along with my badger bristle brush!</li>
    <li> Good shape and easy to keep clean. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that since it is stainless steel it doesn&#x27;t keep the lather warm for more than a few seconds.</li>
    <li> A bit smaller than I expected. Maybe my fault for not checking the size but other than that it has a nice build to it and doesn&#x27;t look cheap. Will work nicely with a smaller sized brush. But definitely won&#x27;t fit the larger ones unless you want to bang it up.  I&#x27;ll just stick to face lathering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this very little so far, but it&#x27;s seems to be well made and fine for its purpose.</li>
    <li> Not big enough to work up a good lather.</li>
    <li> I really am impressed with shaving bowl.</li>
    <li> too small - not useful</li>
    <li> Looks nice, works adequately as a shaving bowl, but has a slightly cheap feel about it; the base, for example, is simply glued onto the bottom of the bowl, and came off after 3 weeks light use.</li>
    <li> Perfect size to produce a good lather.</li>
    <li> Very easy to clean and never loses its shine even after multiple cleanings.</li>
    <li> This bowl is great ergonomically, and my shaving soap container fits right in, but it&#x27;s priced a little high for something that could be handled with a widemouthed coffee mug.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and shape</li>
    <li> Would be a five star rating but the bowl gets pretty got when filled with hot water.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size for my husband to mix his lather in. It looks pretty on my counter too! He really enjoys this along with the Luxury Shaving Gift Set I purchased for him!</li>
    <li> very nice fast shipping , does it was design to do. will buy another one for the office so I can get to work sooner.</li>
    <li> Very nice soap bowl.  Handy to have, cleans up nice and looks nice. Professional look.  Looks good sitting on my counter.</li>
    <li> This product is not well made.  After about 7 months of use, the stand (the product is made of two separate pieces glued together) detached from the bowl.</li>
    <li> not as polished as i would like had a dent in it also</li>
    <li> I like it. I&#x27;m just questioning if it&#x27;s worth the price. A mug would work just fine.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than described. Too small for lathering. Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> Poor quality. The base fell off after a couple of months of soaking in hot water. Cheap glue. On the plus side the top portion is now the perfect size for travel.</li>
    <li> I use this for placing my shaving soap into. The soaps that I purchase fit perfectly into the shape of these bowls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a pewter shaving bowl which is very ornate to make the lather.</li>
    <li> I used it not only as a shaving bowl, It decorates my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl if washed with warm water, it remains warm and nice for the touch even during winter cold mornings!</li>
    <li> This is a nice sized stainless bowl that fits well in the hand and is ideal for use with tube type shave cream. It might be a bit pricey but all in all I like it very much.</li>
    <li> I needed something that would serve the purpose yet look nice in our powder room.  Ta Da!!  It fits the bill and he really likes it plus it is easy to clean and is large enough to hold the soap.</li>
    <li> I have no problem with this bowl other than the fact its NOT 4 inches wide.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice shaving bowl.</li>
    <li> Classy and functional</li>
    <li> Does the job very well.  Doesn&#x27;t rust at all and works up a great lather when using Shave Soap.  I currently use the Van Der Hagen Select Shave Soap and the lather I get is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning up is also very nice; I use hot water and remove the soap from the dish temporarily while I clean out the bowl.  The residue from used soap washes off completely with the hot water and I let it air dry with the remaining soap puck in it (still somewhat damp from removing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing about this is, it is steel (stainless), so it conducts heat.  What I end up doing is run extremely hot water in the sink and fill it with hot water and let it sit for about 2 minutes; then dump out the water (keep the water in the sink) and lather up the soap; this allows for a nice warm shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product with no issues since I purchased.</li>
    <li> This little bowl is so cool. Love the classic design and the stainless steel is a must-have. I have a matching cup for my soap and the two really add style to my shaving kit. It is also perfect for setting atop a bowl of steaming water to warm my lather. The steel keeps a nice, uniform heat going.</li>
    <li> Looked nice, Not strong enough for me, it was spot welded. It also would have rusted very quickly. I returned it.</li>
    <li> As far as bowls go, this is a normal bowl. It holds liquids and keeps them from spilling. However, it is much smaller than I&#x27;d anticipated. I didn&#x27;t read the product dimensions, so it&#x27;s my own fault. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the quality of the bowl. I just wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it because it&#x27;s expensive for what it is.</li>
    <li> good product will recommend it to all my friends. and will enjoy this product and enjoy a good shaving experience</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s well made and attractive, but it&#x27;s tiny. Hard to wip up a proper lather with my omega boar.</li>
    <li> Switched to this after a ceramic bowl broke.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Nice looking and nice feeling, but too small for my bowl lathers. Also, the smooth surface doesn&#x27;t help to create a good lather quickly. I am giving this away to a friend. I went with a $2 salsa bowl from Walmart, for the times when I bowl lather.</li>
    <li> Just the right size &amp; weight.</li>
    <li> great product and goood price  very happy</li>
    <li> Nicely made and good looking shaving bowl ideal for travelers,a bit too large for most of the shaving soap</li>
    <li> This bowl is great as long as you can deal with its small size. There isn&#x27;t much room to work up a lather with a brush and that is the only complaint I have.</li>
    <li> It stated it was a certain size but when it arrived it would not fit the soap (which was the same size) in it. Very disappointed.</li>
