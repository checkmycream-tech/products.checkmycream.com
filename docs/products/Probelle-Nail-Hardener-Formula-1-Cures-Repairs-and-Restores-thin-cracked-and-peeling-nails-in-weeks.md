      <li>After years of using gels my nails got really dehydrated</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 months and it has made my life much easier.</li>
      <li>My nails have always been very prone to breaking and splitting.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get goopy or like you have too much polish on.</li>
      <li>were long and strong.</li>
      <li>Glad to say, my nails are no longer soft and are always long.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I normally have either acrylic or gel nails</li>

      <li>Now, I just apply a layer before going to work, it dries quickly, and my nails are protected all day long!!</li>
      <li>Even if clear it builds up into a very classy, natural color.</li>
      <li>, i am a little confusaed , its says CURE , as in use a UV light and cure it ?</li>
      <li>I have finally turned on to this product thanks to a coworker who&#x27;s natural nails</li>
      <li>My nails had gotten soft n brittle after using gel.</li>

<li> this did dry in just the short time i applied it and typed this out .</li>

<li> My natural nails normally peel and are weak and flimsy.</li>

<li> I use it every single week.</li>
<li> but it has saved me many days of being frustrated with the appearance of my nails.</li>
<li> A bit pricey, but money well spent.</li>
<li> After removing the fake nails, my natural nails are brittle, soft and flaky.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it actually makes the nails stronger</li>
<li> I&#x27;m really bad about doing things on a regular basis, but this stuff dries relatively quickly so you can go on about your usual business.</li>
<li> I was given this at an event and can&#x27;t believe the change in just a few uses.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s works on my once, skinny, weak, dry and brittle​ nails.</li>
<li> I have not had a single broken nail since I started using it.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a total game changer!</li>
<li> No more gels for me!</li>
<li> I purchased this to help with small cracks in my nails!</li>
<li> THIS STUFF SERIOUSLY SCREWED UP MY NAIL CHEMISTRY.</li>
<li> After decades of acrylics used to hide my weak, damaged nails</li>
<li> and  they really lookd horrible.</li>
<li> I needed something to help my naturally thin nails.</li>
<li> My nails were still thin and breaking every day!</li>
<li> Really disappointed.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m guessing just another stupid symptom of hypothyroid disease.</li>
<li> I have the worst nails.</li>
<li> However my grandmother&#x27;s nails are in a real bad condition!</li>

    <li> Two weeks and my nails are looking healthier. Even if clear it builds up into a very classy, natural color. Get it.</li>
    <li> Great price...great product...Received on time. Love this product.</li>
    <li> The product did what it promised. My nails are growing nicely with less and less peeling everyday.</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT! My nails are strong and hard again. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used Probelle Formula 2 for my nails because they just needed a touch up! However my grandmother&#x27;s nails are in a real bad condition! Apparently the medicine she takes for her condition affects nails growth. We tried everything and nothing worked EXCEPT for This Probelle Formula 1! My grandmother is so happy she is constantly showing off her nails!! Thanks Probelle!!</li>
    <li> USED IT 6 MONTS, NO CHANGE</li>
    <li> I needed something to help my naturally thin nails. Especially after removing the acrylic that for years protected them. Seems to be doing just what it advertises.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing.  My nails look fabulous.  I was nervous about purchasing something this pricy that I have never heard of or used over the internet, but I am so glad, in this case, that I did so.  I would recommend and will repurchase this formula.</li>
    <li> I have been using nail magic but I like this brand better.  good protrction</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle.  My nails are growing Very fast, Love Probelle!</li>
    <li> Does not work. My nails were still thin and breaking every day!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! My nails had gotten soft n brittle after using gel. Then my friend introduced me to this product which was recommended at a show for beauticians. Glad to say, my nails are no longer soft and are always long. My daughter also uses it with great success. A bit pricey, but money well spent.</li>
    <li> This has helped my nails to stop peeling and breaking when it is applied. I have the worst nails. It doesn&#x27;t fix the problem when not applied and I have to continue to have a decent, fresh coat on my nails for it to work but it has saved me many days of being frustrated with the appearance of my nails.</li>
    <li> i just bought this and i am apply at this moment , i am a little confusaed , its says CURE , as in use a UV light and cure it ? or CURE as in fixes the problem with flaking , thin nails that break easy .... or BOTH ???? please somebody answer my question ..... i also got the step 2 to this step 1 . the Probelle touchngrow PLUS ..... next step is to apply that . this did dry in just the short time i applied it and typed this out . if i&#x27;m not supposed to cure it under the UV light , thats good , cuz i&#x27;m not going to .... if i have an opinion besides this i will add to this .</li>
    <li> I normally have either acrylic or gel nails but occasionally like to take them off and let my natural nails “breath” for a few months.  After removing the fake nails, my natural nails are brittle, soft and flaky.  This time around, I started to use Probelle’s Touch n’ Grow and Touch n’ Grow Plus to bring my nails back to life.  I applied a thin coat of Touch n’ Grow on a daily basis and within 2 or 3 weeks, my nails started to grow in strong and healthy.  They’ve grown just wonderfully!!  I have now decided that I will be staying with my natural nails since they have grown so  nicely! RECOMMEND!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have never had long fingernails in my life. I have not had a single broken nail since I started using it. I&#x27;m not sure if it actually makes the nails stronger or if it just reinforces them but I will take it! I don&#x27;t just sit around and do nothing all day. I work with my hands and have plenty of nail breaking opportunities!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED - AFTER THE FIRST BOTTLE OF THIS I STARTED NOTICING A CHANGE IN MY NAILS AND THEY BEGAN TO BREAK AGAIN EVEN WITH THE PRODUCT ON THE NAILS. I THOUGHT MAYBE MY NAILS NEEDED A BREAK FROM THIS PRODUCT SO I STOPPED USING IT FOR AWHILE. AS MY NAIL STARTED TO GROW OUT THEY WERE MORE BRITTLE THAN THEY HAD EVER BEEN IN MY LIFE. NOW I HAVE ONLY NAIL THAT HAS GROWN SINCE STARTING THIS PRODUCT AND THE NAILS FLAKE AND PEAL! I AM HOPING THAT ONCE THIS NAIL GROWS OUT MY NAILS WILL GO BACK TO NOT BEING BRITTLE. ITS LIKE THIS STUFF SERIOUSLY SCREWED UP MY NAIL CHEMISTRY. I ALSO HAVE MORE LINES AND RIDGES IN MY NEW NAIL.</li>
    <li> Another terrific formula from Probelle. It&#x27;s works on my once, skinny, weak, dry and brittle​ nails. I use it every single week.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to help with small cracks in my nails! I used it according to the directions for two weeks! It totally worked! Not a single split or crack and I haven&#x27;t used it again in about three weeks! I&#x27;ll probably use it once a month for a week at a time to maintain my nails!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;am very happy with this nail hardener, my nails are growing and look very healthy.</li>
    <li> Dries quick.  Seems to be working well.</li>
    <li> After decades of acrylics used to hide my weak, damaged nails I have finally turned on to this product thanks to a coworker who&#x27;s natural nails were long and strong. After just weeks of using it according to instructions, my nails have grown so beautiful I just cannot believe it!! Now, I just apply a layer before going to work, it dries quickly, and my nails are protected all day long!! I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 months and it has made my life much easier.</li>
    <li> My natural nails normally peel and are weak and flimsy. I was given this at an event and can&#x27;t believe the change in just a few uses. My nails are strong and hard and have completely stopped peeling. It&#x27;s a total game changer!</li>
    <li> Probelle Touch N&#x27; Grow is amazing stuff.  My nails have always been very prone to breaking and splitting.  Since I have been using this my nails are looking great.  Don&#x27;t be put off by the idea of putting some on your nails every day.  I&#x27;m really bad about doing things on a regular basis, but this stuff dries relatively quickly so you can go on about your usual business.</li>
    <li> After years of using gels my nails got really dehydrated and  they really lookd horrible. I tried many products that never worked. I found this Probelle Nail Hardener on Nails Magazine and decided to give it a try! I have to say I am really happy I have found this brand! It provides all the products I need to keep my nails long and strong! No more gels for me!</li>
    <li> My nails kept peeling and splitting. I&#x27;m guessing just another stupid symptom of hypothyroid disease. I&#x27;d used gel polish to help with the strength but when it would peel off, my nails were a wreck! Then I bought Probelle! My nails are looking great!! I used it it every day for a week. Then took it off and reapplied for a week. It doesn&#x27;t get goopy or like you have too much polish on. Dries super fast. Great product!</li>
    <li> Using it as instructed, nails are growing with great flexibility, I bumped them a few times and the do not crack.</li>
    <li> I have tried to get my nails to grow all my life without luck. I have spent hundreds of dollars trying to grow nice nails. I even used to get a manicure every 1-2 weeks. Within 2 weeks my nails had grown amazingly, and I only used this product and followed  the directions on the bottle.</li>
    <li> Really disappointed. I used it for two days and actually thought the product was great - until I noticed the announcement on the bottle saying &amp;#34;contains formaldehyde&amp;#34;.  This is a very toxic chemical - whatever you put on your nails is going to be absorbed into your body. I will not use this. Instead, I am returning and just ordered a nail strengthener that claims to be &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;. Hopefully that will work out!</li>
