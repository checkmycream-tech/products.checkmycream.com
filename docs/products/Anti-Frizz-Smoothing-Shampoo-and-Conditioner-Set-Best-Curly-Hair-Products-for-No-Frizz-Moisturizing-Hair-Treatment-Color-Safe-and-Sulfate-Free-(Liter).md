<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is great! Leaves my hair so smooth. And a really cool looking bottle! Triple thread has done it again!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner! My hair feels amazing every time I use it. Love it!</li>
    <li> My sister&#x27;s hair is a frizz machine! So this stuff is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Just recently tried this shampoo and conditioner and love it! I have a sensitive scalp and thick hair which is prone to tangle so always struggle to find good shampoos but this worked wonders. It didn&#x27;t iiritate my scalp at all and I could totally notice the smoothing effect. Bonus is it smells great too!!!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite shampoo! It leaves my hair so soft and shiny. I have naturally frizzy hair so this shampoo is perfect! Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand what went wrong here I bought the smaller set to try this shampoo/ conditioner out and liked it. So I purchased this larger set, the thing is that both the shampoo and conditioner containers have shampoo! No conditioner!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this just a couple times but even by the first use my hair was so soft and shiny and no fly aways!  I love it!!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this set. I tried the other sets of shampoo and conditioner and the smoothing was my favorite. I felt like I had just left the salon. Great quality! I&#x27;m glad they changed the design of the bottle!</li>
    <li> Seriously feels like salon hair.</li>
    <li> From opening the bottles for the first and smelling this, I fell in love with this shampoo and conditioner set. My husband loves a quality shampoo and conditioner and has paid over $40 for just one bottle. Getting both the shampoo and conditioner (32 oz each) for $29.99 is an awesome deal for a top notch shampoo. I am a guy with thick short hair that gets matted often. After using this my hair feel tangle free.</li>
    <li> Believe me when I say this is a huge bottle of shampoo and conditioner.  I was pleasantly surprised by the smooth feeling of hair after using this shampoo.  The smell was nice and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles came with lid and also included were pumps.  I am not sure why the pumps were an afterthought, but anyway, its nice to have pumps as it would be difficult to use without them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this again.  Received the product at a discount for honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I received a discount on this product to write a review. As a professional hairstylist I was impressed with the product. The smell was light and refreshing, and I really liked that this product has no paragons or sulfates, which makes it great for someone who has color treated hair. The only complaint I have is that it made my hair feel a little dry, and I just used a leave in conditioner. I would recommend this product for someone who has color treated, oily hair.</li>
    <li> Very soft, nice smell. Perfect for daily use.</li>
    <li> Have not used long but I don&#x27;t have any issues w smell it feels nice and was huge bottles packaged well I&#x27;m very happy I did receive discount to review it.  After having awhile I&#x27;ll update it is thick creamy a light pleasant smell and we r scent sensitive household my hair is soft and the pumps make it easy to use</li>
    <li> Both the shampoo and conditioner had an awesome fragrance.  The both seemed to do a good job, but I was concerned about a couple of the ingredients.  I researched the ingredients and there were a few of them that could cause dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dimethicone traps everything under it, including bacteria, sebum and impurities, plus it could lead to increased breakouts and blackheads.  Dimethicone prevents the skin from performing its normal activities, like sweating, temperature regulating, sloughing off dead skin cells, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not find Quanternium 95 on Google, it came up as Quaternium 95, so is it misspelled?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Methylisothiazolinone could cause nerve damage.  It’s a chemical substance that can control or kill harmful microorganisms.  I found this information on the Annmarie Gianni website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not find Lanilool on Google, it came up as Linalool, so is it misspelled?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of the ingredients are different types of silicones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both labels list the same ingredients, so was there a error in the labeling?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo Ingredients that were on the bottle that I received:&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua), Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Stearamidopropyl, Amodimethicone, Hydrocyethylcellulose, Citric Acid, Quanternium 95, Methychloroisothiazolinone, Panthenol, Disodium EDTA, Cetrimonium Chloride, Trideceth-12, Propanediol, Fragrance (parfum), Lanilool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner Ingredients that were on the bottle that I received:&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua), Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Stearamidopropyl, Amodmethicone, Hydrocyethylcellulose, Citric Acid, Quanternium 95, Methychloroisothiazolinone, Panthenol, Disodium EDTA, Cetrimonium Chloride, Trideceth-12, Propanediol, Fragrance (parfum), Lanilool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for a discounted price for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Just receive this shampoo and conditioner, I have fairly long, on the dry side, curly hair. This shampoo and conditioner has a wonderful smell, you also really do not need more then a small amount of the shampoo as it lathers great. Love the fact that it is sulfate free. The conditioner made my hair relax and smooth, easy to untangle. All and all i highly recommend these two produces. I just removed all my other shampoos.</li>
    <li> Mind-blowing! Love this shampoo and conditioner. My hair is really clean. I only needed to wash it once with this product. I can see this is my only shampoo and conditioner I will ever use. The smell is incredible and the shine is awesome. I have no frizz either. They are both really big bottles with a awesome pump. This smoothing shampoo is wonderful. This product will last a very long time. Love it. My hair is so soft and manageable now. I don&#x27;t even have any tangles. I received this product in exchange for my unbiased review. This is a five star rating. I wish I could give it a extra star. This is sulfate free and color safe and I color my hair and it didn&#x27;t wash it out.</li>
    <li> I am picky about my hair care products. This shampoo and conditioner has gone above and beyond my expectations. I color my hair frequently so sulfate free is always at the top of my list! The smell so great. I can smell it throughout the day. They are a lot bigger then expected and come with pumps. My hair is thin and wavy, a bad combination. I put it to my hair test of letting it air dry, it actually didn&#x27;t dry frizzy! I will be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner set work great for my hair. I have long fine straight to slightly wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;Some times I skip washings, but still condition and sometimes I wash &amp; condition many days in a row.&lt;br /&gt;With Triple Thread Smoothing Shampoo &amp; Conditioner my hair is really just the way I like it, It looks&lt;br /&gt;healthy with a nice sheen to it, its not greasy, its not flat, or dry with fly aways, just smooth healthy looking&lt;br /&gt;hair. The huge bottles have handy pumps, the shampoo and conditioner have a mild summer scent, and&lt;br /&gt;the shampoo lathers well.  I love that they have no paraben or no sulfate in them, which I guess I assumed&lt;br /&gt;the rest would be more natural ingredients, but after reading concerns on other reviews I hope all is good&lt;br /&gt;when I check them out, because I really really do love my hair when using this duo. I bought this product at&lt;br /&gt;a promotional price for review &amp; testing. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my&lt;br /&gt;reviews are honest and based off of mine &amp; my family&#x27;s experience with the product.</li>
    <li> This is some of the best shampoo &amp; conditoner I&#x27;ve used. I didn&#x27;t realize they were such big bottles till I received them! They both smell wonderfully &amp; work just as well! My only complaint is that they only include one pump &amp; therefore I&#x27;ve had to search to find a second pump piece for my bottle of conditioner. It should include two of the pumps so someone doesn&#x27;t have to switch between the two or locate another pump to buy.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it was one of the best shampoo &amp; conditoner products I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this shampoo and conditioner combo, and I was asked to review this item. The shampoo leaves my hair squeaky clean, despite not having sulfates (which seems like an anomaly), and has a very pleasant smell. The conditioner is by far one of the best I have ever used, it smells fantastic, and allows me to comb through my very curly hair effortlessly. My hair is not nearly as unruly as it normally is because of this product, and flat ironing leaves me with a sleek and polished look. I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells fantastic and it really does make my hair feel soft and smooth. I only wish it was easier to use if it just had a pump. It will easily last me another 3 months before it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 week now. I love it. My hair feels amazing! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and how soft my hair felt. The bottles are huge and come with a pump that is great! Love that its sulfate and paraben free.</li>
    <li> When receiving Wavebreak in the mail I was excited to use it because I&#x27;ve heard Sulfate Free shampoos are really good for your hair. It came with a nice pump that works smoothly and effectively. It gives enough shampoo with one pump. The product smells great and washes out amazingly, I also noticed throughout the day my hair seemed to stay fresh, The reason why I gave it four stars is because it isn&#x27;t the greatest shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used but I do recommend this shampoo and conditioner if you are looking for a product that won&#x27;t damage your hair!!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting bottles this big! And with how big they are, I&#x27;m really happy they added pumps. I smelled both of them, and its a bit weird that they smell different, I think the conditioner smells a bit off. The shampoo smells nice and fruity, however. I do enjoy the packaging, it seems like salon grade shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone with fine hair and a slightly dryer scalp, I think these work perfectly as an everyday shampoo and conditioner. I received this product at a discount for my unbiased review, all words and opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is mildly scented, not overwhelming like some, and it cleans well. Using the shampoo and conditioner together I have soft and very manageable hair. My hair seems to be holding it&#x27;s style better. The bottles are much bigger than I had imagined, and they come with pump lids which is nice. I like this shampoo and conditioner. It is so nice to be able to buy sulfate free product without paying a fortune at the health food store! My only misgiving is that both bottles look the same so I have to read the label to know which is which--in the shower, without my glasses! Great product, will definitely buy again.</li>
