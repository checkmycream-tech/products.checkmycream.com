<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Stay clear of this 1 person company!!  They are HORRIBLE to deal with if you have any issues at all!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I use, and it works well!</li>
    <li> I like this paste its not sticky and it smells great. I will buy this product again. American Crew is the best.</li>
    <li> I am just starting out using hair products and so I bought AC&#x27;s pomade, fiber, grooming cream and molding clay in addition to this. I&#x27;ve tried them all at least once but I keep going back to the Defining Paste. Most of the others don&#x27;t mesh with my thin curly hair very well and tend to feel like I&#x27;m just pulling my hair out during application, they also tend to be too stiff and don&#x27;t allow me to run my fingers through. The Defining Paste goes in really easily and never feels or looks unnatural. I typically put it in while my hair is damp and then again once it has dried. The only drawback is that I usually need to reapply mid-day because my curls really fight the product after half a day of running my fingers through (my bad?), but that is very minor. I will keep trying out the rest as well too and see if I find ways to have the other products work well for me.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It holds my hair in place nicely without turning into a hard shell.  It&#x27;s not oily or sticky, and it washes easily out of your hair.  No oily residue left behind after shampooing.</li>
    <li> I previously had used the American Crew \\&quot;Fiber\\&quot; product, which is very similar to this, but Fiber has a \\&quot;high hold\\&quot; instead of this paste&#x27;s \\&quot;medium hold\\&quot;.  Since I didn&#x27;t really need the firmness of the \\&quot;high hold\\&quot;, I figured that this \\&quot;Paste\\&quot; product would be worth a try when my jar of AC Fiber ran out.  Although the \\&quot;Defining Paste\\&quot; works well from a holding standpoint, I just can&#x27;t stand the smell of it.  It is a very strong, sweet, flowery perfume smell I would associate with cheap women&#x27;s perfume, not a men&#x27;s hair product.  And being in your hair, it follows you around all day long, and gets into your pillowcase.  After a few hours it started driving me crazy.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to get in the shower and wash it out.  I tried it a couple of times just to be sure it was really the paste and not something else I was smelling, and that it wasn&#x27;t just because it was new.  It is definitely this paste that smells, and the smell does not diminish over time.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t bother you as much - we all have different sensitivity to various smells - it may bother some of the people you are around all day.  Unfortunately I&#x27;m tossing this expensive little jar and ordering another AC Fiber instead.  AC Fiber does not have a noticeable smell.</li>
    <li> As a long time user of American Crew &#x27;Classic Wax&#x27;, I was disappointed to find that it is no longer available.  I did find that this &#x27;Defining Paste&#x27; works just as well.</li>
    <li> I used to use American Crew Matte which seems to be discontinued.  This had a similar description and same color of label so I assumed that it was the Matte&#x27;s replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, was I wrong.  It&#x27;s really thick like a paste which makes it hard to work into my hair.  And it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold very well.</li>
    <li> product works as described and it is one that we get over and over again</li>
    <li> It gets the job done and it is NOT oily. I am able to fix my hair in the morning, then if a hat or something messes it up, I can fix my hair to look good again unlike hair gel that is tough and once hair gel gets messed up you can&#x27;t fix it without more hair gel.</li>
    <li> Product works great, but has parabens.</li>
    <li> This stuff holds all day. A very small amount goes a long way and gives you time to mold and craft your hair the way you want. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> Works great and looks natural after your hair dries. Doesn&#x27;t make your hair clump or look shiny/greasy like some other products.</li>
    <li> Decent product, but it&#x27;s unfortunately so sticky I have to ensure my hair is wet and take time to properly spread it out.</li>
    <li> maybe its just not for me. I bought this before my hair stylist recommended it, but it caused me to lose a lot of hair. once i stopped using it, the lost stopped.</li>
    <li> holds the hair. just how i like it</li>
    <li> American Crew Defining Paste is not a paste.  It&#x27;s more of a putty or a soft clay.  The stuff is very hard, and I have to dilute it a great deal in order to work with it.  Also, the aroma is not so great--kind of medicinal.  When the can runs out, I am going back to American Crew Forming Cream.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say much about this stuff except that it works as described: medium hold, low shine.  For when you want your hair to stay put and not look too slick and spikey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paste works best for me with not-quite-towel-dry hair.  I rub a finger-full into my hands and work it into my locks.  I can shove my hair around until I&#x27;m satisfied and be on my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works pretty well for a bed-head style that is soft and maneuverable later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It *can* be a little greasy on your hands for those of you who like to finger-comb during the day but otherwise it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Always great! thanks!</li>
    <li> The way you are supposed to use this product is by putting some in the palm of your hand, then rub your hands together vigorously.  warm it up, THEN work it through your hair.  It works great for me.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, American Crew at a great price.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  It should be used very sparingly, otherwise you&#x27;ll have a head full mess.  Kind of like a pomade but less greasy feeling.  Medium hold low shine gives your hair a clean natural look, not like gel which makes your hair look wet.</li>
    <li> I like that it has low shine.  More natural look, less old-man look.  Took a short while to get used to working with it, but I found that if you heat it up by rubbing it into your hands, it distributes more evenly through your hair.  Not much needed but that of course depends on the length of your hair.  Perhaps better for shorter hair, depending on the hold you desire.  When my hair starts to get longer i switch to the American Crew &#x27;Forming Cream&#x27;.</li>
    <li> This product provides excellent hold without being overly sticky or drying into a gross &amp;#34;shell&amp;#34; that turns my hair into a giant helmet.</li>
    <li> The lady at the salon told me the products sold over the internet are not the same.  They are.  Salons are overcharging.</li>
    <li> Great value, Fast Shipping!</li>
    <li> Meh. It leaves my hair a bit crusty and shiny. My hair dude said he thought Crew quality has gone down the last few years. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true, but I ended up buying something else that was more expensive in the end.</li>
    <li> It works ok I expected a lot more from it.</li>
    <li> I have read some very good reviews on this product but for me it is just okay, I will not buy again.  Prefer my hair to not have any greasy look from 8 till 5.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I work at an airport and it gets really windy some days. This goes on in the morning and holds until close of play.</li>
    <li> I swear by this hair paste. It turns me from a five to a solid eight. Firm enough to turn my bowl cut into a pompadour and soft enough to invite fingers in my hair.</li>
    <li> Worked well with much less shine than their pomade version. You are also able to use less of the product, in my opinion, to achieve the desired result. It is much thicker than their pomade requiring more rubbing of the hands to make it malleable but once applied it feels nicer than the pomade while still allowing a good deal of flexibility so you don&#x27;t have the helmet hair outcome like with gel products.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this stuff! Smells amazing!</li>
    <li> American Crew defining paste is my personal favorite hair style product.  I have thick, straight hair and since I am not patient enough to grow it out, am stuck with short hair that likes to stand straight up.  This stuff is strong enough to hold it in place when I faux hawk it up or to keep it laying down when need be, but it never feels heavy and doesn&#x27;t dry or harden up much.  I think that is due to the beeswax that they use, which gives a more natural look.  Also with the beeswax I feel like it washes out in the shower much easier.  I have tried other &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; products but find that a lot of them use heavy oils, which refuse to wash out despite repeated shampooings.  Oh and also, I feel like i don&#x27;t have to use much of the product to do my hair, so it lasts longer than any other product I have ever bought.  All in all, I would definitely recommend at least trying it if you need a strong hold and want a natural look, that won&#x27;t take a week to get out of your hair!</li>
    <li> Love this to add texture and style to my son&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s not stiff and it&#x27;s great for thin or thick hair. One of my son&#x27;s hair is thin and the other is thick, but this works perfect for both!</li>
    <li> Good paste but a little pricey. I have found others that do the job just as well but for a lot less.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, good hold, no sheen, nice smell.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair product. It has enough hold for a natural look, without the smell of Fiber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very natural matte finish if you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
    <li> Really like the product. Great hold with a matte finish. Amazon Prime on the other hand has a sketchy record on delivering products in the two day window they promote.</li>
    <li> I tried the Defining Paste on a whim because I had plenty of the other styling products. This has a bit stronger hold, giving my hair body without stiffness. But it has a dull appearance. Maybe I&#x27;m supposed to use it in conjunction with something else....maybe a little Pomade on top of the Paste? For me that gets to be too much. So if you like a flat finish on your hair with a fairly strong hold, this might be what you want.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for.  It stays in all day and works great.  Highly recommend this to anyone in the market for some hair products!</li>
    <li> I never liked this as much as Matte, which seemed to be the product that this replaced.  It was ok, but prone to clumping.  This also didn&#x27;t work as well as hair got longer.  I ended up going back to using the forming cream.</li>
    <li> The smell is awesome.  But as for as the paste goes, it really doesn&#x27;t hold at all.  More just for smell. lol.</li>
    <li> i use this stuff daily.  i purchased it at the store the first time to try it out, then bought some online.  this is my second purchase online and it&#x27;s the same great product at a significant savings.</li>
    <li> I love American crew products and my local cvs doesn&#x27;t have the defining paste and ive allways wanted to try it out and it Amazing!</li>
    <li> Great paste. Very mild smell which was the only thing I was worried about given that I&#x27;m allergic to many scented products.</li>
    <li> I like the hold and texture, but it smells like Axe body spray, which is a deal breaker for me. The scent is too strong to ignore.</li>
    <li> Product has the hold that I need for my thick hair, but doesn&#x27;t look hard as a rock or greasy.  Good product.  I will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> He was visiting and needed something for his hair to stay down.He was playing with all my products and I knew this was for him. So i tried to find it in OK. but couldn&#x27;t so when found it on here n sent it to him  DAD IS IN HEAVEN NOW. AMERICAN CREW PASTE IS AWESOME!So of course I had to get the other item to go with it... lol</li>
    <li> I have used almost all Crew hair creams and pastes in the last few years and this one is my favorite. I have 1&amp;#34;-3&amp;#34; inch, curly, dry, jew-fro-y hair, and this stuff works well and lasts forever. I use every day and go through about one oz per month. Worth the $$</li>
    <li> Mostly works for what you want it to do, but it smells like the dentist&#x27;s office. Horrible. Would be much better if it smells like AC Fiber.</li>
    <li> Works great and has a great look and feel to it. I wish it had a little better hold, my hair tends to fall throughout the day</li>
    <li> My favorite hair paste-relatively cheap, you don&#x27;t need a lot for your hair, and it keeps it in place (well, mine at least) without giving it a greasy feel nor making it too stiff. Works for me with both dry and wet hair (though wet needs a lil more). Have used for 5 years, will keep using for more to come.</li>
    <li> Why the hell do you put a sticker bar code over the top of the product? When I take it off it rips the label on top and I now have a nameless paste I keep under my sink. This stuff lasts a year for me which is why I will find this small tiny issue continuously irritating. Thanks for the product, keep the sticker or put it somewhere else next time.</li>
    <li> A bit of context: I have what is more or less an undercut - pretty short on the sides (size 1 or under clipper usually) and a bit longer on top (1-1.5&amp;#34;). I usually cut my own hair or have a friend cut it for me so I&#x27;m not sure on specifics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is exactly as it claims - low shine, medium hold. It&#x27;s very workable even throughout the day which I appreciate a lot. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy, and it feels as good as you can hope hair with product in it will feel. The smell is incredible, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it for awhile as I&#x27;ve since adopted nopoo and had no need for it, but whenever I do end up washing my hair I&#x27;ll usually use this for about a week after until the oils in my hair build back up. I almost miss having my hair smell so wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, will absolutely use and recommend to all friends.</li>
    <li> For my husband.  He loves the stuff.  This is a much better price than at the salon.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell you if the price is good... but I like this white past stuff better than the clear gel (works better with my graying, Asian hair :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No there&#x27;s no coloring involved with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve probably purchased every defining paste on the market.  My favorite one was discontinued (don&#x27;t you hate when that happens?) and then i came across this guy.  Most men (in my opinion) don&#x27;t like to change these kind of things so I just keep on ordering this product over and over again.  Great for a matte look with decent hold throughout the day.  Kicker?  It washes out pretty easily.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than the stores and it works great.  Low shine, good hold.</li>
    <li> Thougt I would be receiving the pomade after comparing my own jar at home with the one online and was surprised to see a weird white paste when I opened the box. Wouldn&#x27;t have minded using the paste but it&#x27;s not very easy to apply to my hair.</li>
    <li> As others have commented, this product is nice for a little hold, low shine, and flexibility. Also, the &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; is not so much a paste as it looks like a solid block of clay. I seriously thought my package got frozen over due to the low temperatures. However after keeping it at room temperature for a few days, the consistency did not change, so it is simply just how it is. Don&#x27;t be afraid of digging in to get the paste out. From the American Crew website, you should &amp;#34;emulsify between palms&amp;#34; first. Completely agree. Put a small amount in your palm, and then rub your hands together quickly. A few rotations will do the trick as you feel your hands heat up. Then apply it to your hair...in my experience a little damp works best, to get the paste going through quickly. The result is some definition and flexibility. Definition in that your hair has some styling and flexibility in that your hair can move freely, unlike some gels that seems to glue your hair together and create sharp porcupine-like points.</li>
    <li> great product. i loved it. but you have to use it properly</li>
    <li> Have ordered this multiple times love this pretty close to the aveda paste</li>
    <li> Love the smell and hold.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I have used other American Crew products over the years and liked them.  Now older my hair has gotten thinner and my hair stylist recommended this for me.  I get my hair cut very short with a #3 razor on the sides and back and leave just enough on the top to spike.  I do let it grow in quite a bit between cuts.  As is often the case, when she used the product on me it looked great but when I tried myself at home I just couldn&#x27;t get it to look good.  I have thinning fine hair and I found this product stuck to my fingers or went onto my hair in clumps.  I think the product is fine and that it is meant for someone who can take a small amount, rub it between their fingers and apply it to make their hair look fuller and styled.  For me due to the thinness of my hair I just couldn&#x27;t get it to work.  It made it flat and greasy instead.  I prefer gels or mousses for myself.  So I am in no way knocking the product.  It just wasn&#x27;t meant for someone with hair like mine.</li>
    <li> I am a female with medium-length fine wavy hair and just a small amount of this product works well to keep the waves looking smooth without weighing them down or making them hard and crunchy. It keeps the frizz at bay!</li>
    <li> This is the type of product that&#x27;s supposed to be limited to professional sales. But seeing it on Amazon for a few dollars less than the retail price was too tempting to wait until my hair place got more in stock. It works fine - very light scent, not &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; looking or stiff.</li>
    <li> I doesn&#x27;t do the job of holding a spike as I had expected.  Too bad!  Still looking!!</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time. And I can tell you that it has ZERO hold. I mean ZERO! At least the Fiber has a bit hold, but the paste has absolutely no hold. And it made my hair look greasy and dirty. Very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Is this made of unicorn fecal matter? Why is it so expensive?&lt;br /&gt;18 bucks (more or less) for 3 ounces, seriously?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a product, it&#x27;s good though.</li>
    <li> The Defining Paste is the perfect product for my medium caliber 2-3&amp;#34; hair style. Goes on very easy and looks very natural without the wet look. I put it on after I towel dry my hair and it lasts all day. The American Crew website has videos on how to apply each of the different kind of pucks.</li>
    <li> Well the product is paste, however when I ordered I thought it was pomade since they have same packaging. I explained what I did and if I could exchange they said I would have to pay 25percent restock fee, REALLY on a $20.. item and they had no pomade until 1 month. I have ordered from them before and told them that. I thought I actually clicked on my previous ordered item. BUT I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN, TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!</li>
    <li> great for longer hair....LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Really good hair product that holds.</li>
    <li> This used to be a great product but America Crew changed the formula and now it&#x27;s really greasy.  It&#x27;s also is not matte finish as the label claims and makes your hair thin and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, those that said American Crew Fiber is to thick, it&#x27;s easier to work with now, but still the whole product line has changed since american crew changed manufacturing</li>
    <li> My husband loves this hair cream. It’s not greasy and you don’t need to use very much of it. It’s quite pricey if you purchase at a salon, so Amazon is definitely the way to go.</li>
    <li> I have a blond faux hawk.  This makes it looks shiney and greasy.  It&#x27;s not as good as fiber.  Not sure why they made it, their other products are better.</li>
    <li> Really great product, but a little pricey. I use the Short Sexy Hair Maniac Wax to spike up and give my hair volume and then add a little of the Crew Pomade to give it some shine.  Both leave a little residue on your pillow if you overdo the amount you use.</li>
    <li> ..then look no further, this is the alternative since the Sharp brand discontinued the Guck ..and it is has been a hunt to find a replacement!  the medium hold is defiantly more pliable and easier to work with than Crew&#x27;s firm version.  we noticed a little goes a long way and we are just happy to find my hubbie a replacement!  Hubbie has short and curls in hair, so the paste provides a hold on the style without being sticky and no shine ..perfect.</li>
    <li> This product works and does not leave your hair looking like it has a bunch of gel in it.  I overcame the sticker price and would not consider using anything else.  I always wondered who would spend 15 bucks on hair gel and why, but after using this product I would not question it.</li>
    <li> Holds my hair in perfect shape, glorious.</li>
    <li> Great product that works as advertised. Not much to say about it other than that. It produces a nice hold, with a medium to low sheen. You can&#x27;t be too rough with your hair throughout the day or it will breakdown, but for most people that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
    <li> Hard to find anywhere else, and this is a pretty good price for it. I was very happy to see this for sale online!</li>
    <li> The product is exactly what I thought it would be. It holds well and it comes off easy, even with just water without shampoo. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great price on a good product</li>
    <li> The product came exactly as described. It works really well, doesn&#x27;t make my hair look &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;, and also smells nice!</li>
    <li> Nice smell, long lasting and it is not greasy like other hair product.  I would highly recommended it.  Easy order and product arrived on time.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST. I&#x27;ve tried every styling product from American Crew and this is by far my favorite. It spread through your hair pretty evenly and it doesn&#x27;t take much to have a nice hold in your hair.</li>
    <li> The smell is not to my liking but other people have told me it smells fine. The smell is not a problem. The problem is how the paste feels and how it is. I do not know if i got a bad batch but it feels like dried play dough. When i put it in my hands it comes out in lumps and is difficult to break down and i end up just putting the lumps into my hair and hope my hair breaks it down and sometimes it does. I, myself would not buy it again. I&#x27;ll just keep buying dove for men paste</li>
    <li> its very dry-sticky. Not goopy like the blue BedHead stuff. Does the job well</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I have longer somewhat curly hair.  Not tight curls, but some waves for sure.  It gives good hold and does so without the shine.  I usually put it in when my hair is towel dried and a bit damp.  Sometimes as it dries it appears to have some shine or still look wet, but just running my fingers through it once fixes that.  Also, it does not feel greasy or oily throughout the day which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> My previous hair paste was discontinued so I have been trying to find a replacement since. This just wasn&#x27;t the right consistency that I was looking for so I didn&#x27;t like how it made my hair look. It also has a funky smell to it.</li>
    <li> Great product and great price. They don&#x27;t sell this one in the stores around here and it&#x27;s my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite.</li>
    <li> I have been using American Crew&#x27;s Fiber for years and wanted to find something that has a nice hold, but doesn&#x27;t make my hair look as greasy. The Defining Paste has a pretty good hold on my somewhat unruly hair and has less greasy and more natural look to it.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what is says it will do! Looked up the product online before I actually bought it and I knew it was for me!</li>
    <li> I really want to love this product, but its just not 100% there. I don&#x27;t think it gives my hair quite enough hold. It almost seems better the second day which is really weird. I may have to try the fiber to see if I can get a stronger hold, but still no shine.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; in every sense of the word. The quality is good which is why it deserves four stars. It doesn&#x27;t break down nor does it feel oily. Unfortunately, I should have bought a wax which is more suitable for what I needed. Definitely going to consider this brand again though, maybe not this product.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this paste. He has dark hair. It holds well and lasts all day. But My son&#x27;s hair that is blonde and fine, it ends up looking greasy and dirty as the day goes on.</li>
    <li> I have think hair and this does not require a lot to get my hair to where it needs to be.</li>
    <li> Good product for thin hair.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair sticky.. but smells good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the tea green paul mitchell product and I think has a better hold than this product. next time i&#x27;ll try the same brand different product with more hold. all in all I like it</li>
    <li> Great Product!! I was using Aveda Pliable, but since my hair is Wavy Curly, with the Aveda product it got stiff..... anyhow, i bought this just because I am always tryng to see what works...My hair has a mind of it&#x27;s own, so I need to be in control of it! So i got it, and I am loving it thus far!!! Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, and definitely not stiff.... Will get some more!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.  Been using it for years and I still haven&#x27;t found a better product.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> It clumps in your hair and it&#x27;s hard to rub in your hands. The medium hold is medium-light hold, by the end of the day it&#x27;s not holding anymore</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the worst hair products I&#x27;ve tried. It is NOT low shine and it has virtually no hold. Makes my hair look and feel greasy almost immediately. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Great style without greasy look.</li>
    <li> I was worried about the paste being too dry as I came from using an Axe paste that wasn&#x27;t much of a paste...but this worked really nicely As it&#x27;s a lot easier to work with and more creamy of a paste (yet still dry). It&#x27;s really easy to thin it out on the palm of your hand into a &#x27;cream&#x27; that you can work with and does not have blobs of it that you cannot thin out. I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a shine, but the hold is pretty good especially if you use a bit more of it if needed.</li>
    <li> Revolutionary is the only word I can use to describe this product. My hair stays in the same spot throughout the whole day.</li>
    <li> I have tried all the other american crew products and by far this on wis the best (close second would be the fiber or the grooming cream).</li>
    <li> This paste is amazing. It doesnt leave any shine in your hair, but holds it where you want it. I love it. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Makes my hair neat without making it look shiny or artificial. Controls hair without making it stiff. After I put it on, it gives the impression that my hair just happens to be naturally neat.</li>
    <li> I do not understand what other reviewers are talking about.  This product works just as described.  You must take a small amount (dime sized)and work it into the palm of your hand.  Once it is more fluid you then work it through your hair by pulling it back through your hair.  Once pulled back you can start messing it up and pulling it where you want.  My only complaint is that because of the beeswax in the product it can cause your hair to become a tad oily after the end of a day.  Beyond that one complaint it works great.  It lasts me about three months at a time.  Would highly recommend it to any guy looking for a nice hold that gives you a dry and textured look.  It works perfect for short hair and for those guys wanting to move around their hair all day long.</li>
    <li> Like the Garnier Fructis Fiber Gum Putty I tried last year and all the hair gels I used in the late 80&#x27;s, American Crew Classic Defining Paste leaves a sticky residue on your hands after use, a residue that does not come off with hot water and soap, nor any other cleaning product I&#x27;ve tried, and lasts all day, seeming to seep back out of your skin after yet another hand washing. So once I apply it, with nitrile surgical gloves, I can&#x27;t touch my hair the rest of the day, an ability I&#x27;ve yet to master. I have no choice but to go back to the only product that holds my hair, though poorly, but that doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my hands, a product I&#x27;ve been using for twenty years, plain old Suave Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also report that an inquiry to American Crew company informs me that Amazon.com is not an authorized distributor of this product and warns me that products sold without their consent may be expired or otherwise not what you ordered.</li>
    <li> Because I possess no styling talent, this is the best product for me. My clue was the word, &amp;#34;Paste&amp;#34; in its name. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Works great! Use it everyday</li>
    <li> Been using this for a while. It holds the hair really well without making it really stiff feeling or looking.</li>
    <li> Seems to do pretty well on medium length hair. I got it to replace discontinued Structure from Liquid Line by the Crew. It has the same basic ingredients, i.e., beeswax and lanolin, in paste form.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. I use this almost very day, it last all day long. . . .</li>
    <li> So glad my stylist told my about this. It&#x27;s a must have.</li>
    <li> I like the way it gives your hair texture but I wish it had a stronger hold but overall I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
    <li> I had previously been using Fiber but as my hair has gotten longer, it become difficult to distribute evenly and work with.  This product is much easier to use and provides enough hold to be useful without being stiff.  Some have complained about the smell - and while it does definitely have a different smell than the Fiber, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s bad at all; it smells like any other expensive salon-style product.  I will be buying more when I run out.</li>
    <li> I have very light blond hair, pomade makes my hair look thin as it clumps together. This defining paste does exactly what I need. Good hold while remaining pliable with low shine. It does a good job of making my hair look more voluminous and textured.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought it a couple times and will continue to do so as long as I keep this particular hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;It has a wonderful masculine scent that gets me many comments. One woman told me it smells like an auto garage, which I very much took as a compliment.</li>
    <li> Great product and cheaper then buying at store.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this, he thinks it doesn&#x27;t make his hair dry out or stick. I like the smell of it and how his hair looks like</li>
    <li> I blow dry my hair bone dry, and then use the defining paste (matte, and holds good with just a tiny spritz of hairspray). I also have some left over forming cream, and it works really well too, just gives the hair a shinier look. For me, that shinier look is nice if I&#x27;m going to a wedding, or dressing up...that sort of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I blowdry the hair in the front up, blow dry the rest totally dry, put some defining paste in my palm, rub my hands together vigorously and warm it up, and then work it into my hair. I love the way the defining paste smells, matte looks nice, and it&#x27;s super easy to get that messy but controlled look. I have slightly wavy hair, not stick straight or curly. I get it cut pretty short (an inch or so), and then let it grow out to about two inches before I get it cut. That&#x27;s about 2 months of growth, and this product works good the entire time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experiment and have fun, but I personally think the Defining Paste is awesome for matte, and forming cream if you want a little bit of shine (but it&#x27;s harder to work into your bone dry hair, and doesn&#x27;t smell as good).</li>
    <li> As advertised, good (but not great) hold, very low shine. I have very thick hair and when its short it takes on a life of its own... I can tame it easily with this.</li>
    <li> When you do your hair, does your head/hands get sticky after using gel or hairspray? Or what about when your hair look shiny or wet and everyone looking at you have the thought that &amp;#34;oh he/she trying too hard to look good or he/she just did his/her hair?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the &amp;#34;low shine&amp;#34; from this product, your hair looks very natural (I&#x27;m hoping to make people feel that &amp;#34;oh he/she just woke up and their hair is just like that). The stickiness (they call it the hold) is ok. It does make your hair feel a bit hard. After touching your hair (after putting it on), your hair will be soft/back to normal but still hold that shape/style somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that this product flakes like you have dandruff at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I accidentally purchased this thinking it was American Crew&#x27;s pomade (which is good). Because I couldn&#x27;t return it I have tried to use it, but see no value in the product. I&#x27;ve talked to the two high-end barbers I go and they concur this is one of American Crew&#x27;s strangest products.</li>
    <li> My husband finally got out of the army and was very excited to get to grow his hair out again to style.  He did his research and this is one of the Paste&#x27;s he found to work the best.  It doesn&#x27;t make his hair hard or gooey which is great for me!  Just holds style for a long time!  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> The local hair place told me that anything online is cheap knock off. Makes no sense why someone would go through trouble of making a perfect replica of packaging and product for an item like this. Anyhow...I have purchased about 4 of these over the last couple of years and I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this and what I have purchased at the local store.</li>
    <li> I have slightly thick wavy hair that is about 3-4 inches long. This product controls my hair well without weighing it down.  As advertised, the paste gives a good matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can make two recommendations to increase the effectiveness of the paste:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Read the directions on the container.  A quick video on American Crew&#x27;s site shows how to apply the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  At least in my case, you may need to keep your hair slightly damp by towel-drying instead of blow drying.  Continue towel drying until the hair becomes cool to the touch and not totally dry.  Then apply paste as instructed.  It seems the paste works best when it can lock in some moisture.  I realized I needed additional moisture (and yes I do condition daily). After some trial and error, I discovered adding a 3-4 small drops of [[ASIN:B003XJXU3Y American Crew Light Hold Texture Lotion]] before applying the putty does the trick.</li>
    <li> this product is fantastic! It&#x27;s all my husband uses, and it never makes his hair greasy. It&#x27;s much different than the other products of the same brand this one takes the cake!</li>
    <li> A very nice product that I can use to sculpt my hair is various fashions. This 3 ounce jar lasted about a year before I needed to get another one.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product I&#x27;ve used. Got a a great deal ordering it from here. Styles my short hair perfectly. Better than gel.</li>
    <li> Even better than expected. I have short fine hair and it works perfect. I have been putting it on with dry hair which makes my hair much stiffer and malleable. However, I just started putting it on with slightly damp hair which makes it stay in my hair longer and gives it body without making it stiff.</li>
    <li> I love this &amp;#34;defining paste&amp;#34;. I would say it &amp;#34;defines&amp;#34; my hair well, I&#x27;ve been using it for years. It gives just the right amount of hold and provides a slightly wet look that looks natural and well put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every now and again I try something else, just to try it. Then I buy another one of these.</li>
    <li> It is a perfect balance between the sine of the pomade and the hold of their fiber.  Great for my neat, kept comb over, not greasy and washes out easily.</li>
    <li> i used to utilize Fiber which is stronger hold.  I used that product mixed with bit of water to dilute it a bit. I bought this thinking I don&#x27;t have to dilute the product but I end up using a bit more of the stuff which makes my thin hair weigh down at the end of the day.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s great if you are looking for that natural but controlled hair type of look.</li>
    <li> Never had any problems, and it&#x27;s cheaper than what you would pay in store. Would recommend to other buyers for sure.</li>
    <li> Having had different lengths of hair, ive used various CREW paste or cremes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Paste is great for medium or short hair and has a long hold with no shiny-ness.</li>
    <li> Works as described. Was previously using American Crew Forming Cream but wanted something with less shine. This product does have less shine but not a lot less. I was looking for a product where it doesn&#x27;t look like I have anything in my hair, and this is not it. Still a good product though hence the 4 stars.</li>
    <li> For the past 2 years I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B000Z5YDO4 Jonathan Product Dirt Texturizing Paste(R) 3.35 oz]], which I liked. But the problem is it costs about $8 more for the same size jar. I decided to start looking at other options and came across American Crew Defining paste and it&#x27;s nearly half the price for the same quantity and it works exactly the same as the higher priced Dirt I used to use. I&#x27;ll be switching over to American Crew going forward and saving some money!</li>
    <li> good stuff, wont use anything else on my hair.</li>
    <li> I use it quite frequently when my hair grows out. Give you a nice shiny look, medium stiff.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. I decided to buy something a bit more expensive than i usually get, so i got this. It holds really well and it makes your hair look healthy and natural, not greasy or wet. It is a small container but you should only need a dime sized amount. The smell isn&#x27;t strong and isn&#x27;t like cologne like other products. I saw a review that said it smelled like a dentists office and it sounds funny but it kind of does.</li>
    <li> This is my hair styling paste of choice.  Easy to work with.  Doesn&#x27;t make my hair too stiff and holds all day long.  Don&#x27;t overdue it when using it.  A little goes a long way.  This was referred by my hair stylist but is much cheaper buying it here.</li>
    <li> Works well with my thick hair, which it suggests against. However the product keeps my hair together and is still soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now. I used to buy it at a beauty store but I&#x27;ve found it at a better price from this vendor.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product!</li>
    <li> Great stuff, but expensive.  I think Got2Be is just as good, and it&#x27;s $5 on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and this does a great job of letting me style it (I have the Gatsby cut). What I love most is that it does not &amp;#34;flake&amp;#34; out if I rub my hands through my hair, or come off greasy in your hands later in the day. I put it on with my hair wet and it provides a firm hold.</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine hair that I am growing out to about 4 inches on top (side part, with some body).  Being that I have thin hair, I needed a product that holds, but does not weigh my hair down, and also provides just a hint of shine.  This stuff is great.  I have used all the other Crew pastes, waxes, fibres, etc...and this is my new favorite.  The hold does not last super long in humidity, but I found that if I use this first, then set it with hair spray, I get nice, soft hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff.  FYI, you can also mix it with just a bit of another product like a fiber or wax to get the extra hold.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair styled all day! Doesnt give it a shiny look which is exactly what i was looking for. Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a product to style their hair with good hold.</li>
    <li> perfect for my thick wavy hair, only takes a little bit and I am set for the day.  Can even freshen up later with a little bit of water.</li>
    <li> I have pretty thick hair, so this is a good choice for anytime after the first week after a haircut. I just scoop up a little bit with my finger, it doesn&#x27;t take much at all, then I rub it on both hands, flatten down my hair, then push up the front. It stays soft and not shiny, so you don&#x27;t look like you have a ton of goop in your hair, and it holds all day. Note: it will liquefy in a hot car. This is a solid product, good for a guy who wants to look good but not look like he&#x27;s trying too hard.</li>
    <li> This item shipped quick and I like to use it. I think I&#x27;ll try some of the other crew products after this.</li>
    <li> Great hair product. Lasts all day, low shine.  Recommed appling when hair is still damp.  Package is small enough for carry on bag.</li>
    <li> Paste works well to shape hair. Also smells good too, the wife approves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would love it if it was a little cheaper tho, but it works great.</li>
    <li> I really like Crew Defining Paste. It allows me to get the hair positioned correctly for the hair style I have. It is non greasy and looks natural. My only problem with Crew is they really love their products and I feel they are overpriced for the amount of product you get.</li>
    <li> First of all, the product came exactly on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The defining paste itself was exactly what I was looking for.  The American Crew fiber has a tougher consistency and I was looking for smoother consistency.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and was a fraction of what you&#x27;d pay in a store.  It&#x27;s a little thick so you have to rub it in your hands for a while.  But it has good holding power and doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great hold and texture, also doesn&#x27;t shine or make your forehead shiny.</li>
    <li> My old stand-by! Great texture with very low shine. I will definitely stock up next time I purchase.</li>
    <li> I would say that this should be advertised as &amp;#34;Low shine, low hold.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s perfect for me, but it doesn&#x27;t hold up well. The advantage is the low shine compared to the paste that is medium shine, medium hold. It does not hold hair as well as the paste yet advertised as medium.</li>
    <li> I have bough cheaper hair products that have been more effective on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is wild but straight. When i let it grow out to comb it back i need some hair&lt;br /&gt;product to tame it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This crew product works but it&#x27;s a a little to controlling i tried applying on a medium amount and&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t  hold all the hairs in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i apply a larger amount it has too much hold. It may not be a bad thing for some&lt;br /&gt;but for me it looks like i have a blob of hair gel on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products control all the hair plus it makes it look natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if your hair style is not natural but more definitive and stylish this is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for individuals who want control plus a natural slick look this product wont do the job.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I was using American Crew&#x27;s \\&quot;Molding Cream\\&quot; until they discontinued it. This product works the same. I have really thick hair and a cowlick in the front and with Defining Paste I&#x27;m able to do whatever I want with my hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my son because he was looking for a paste that can still be manipulated hours later. He uses it everyday.</li>
    <li> Great smell, can&#x27;t tell that you used it, makes your hair look full</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried gels, pommades, and now this defining paste by American Crew.  This is by far the best - easiest to use, smells good, and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Not too sticky, but maintains a flexible hold and can be re-styled later. It is very similar to Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s SumoTech but is a better value because the container is bigger and contains more product.</li>
    <li> I decided to grow up and start spending more than $15 for haircuts, which means I needed to actually by product to make it look nice during the day.&lt;br /&gt;I use very small portions (a dime size), it goes in quickly, very little work, and has a very light scent (heavy scents give me a headache). I&#x27;ve received a lot of unsolicited compliments and I will continue to order.</li>
    <li> This is another great product from American Crew. I used it to replace their pomade I have  used for years because I was tired of the high shine. The defining paste is much better for a lower shine with the same hold. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a medium hold with low shine.</li>
    <li> Product works great, no shine, no wet look, gender-neutral odor (kinda smells like the dentist&#x27;s office). However, seems to get difficult to use when hair is longer than 4 or 5 inches.</li>
    <li> Great product, I like the smell, delivered as stated in time frame.</li>
