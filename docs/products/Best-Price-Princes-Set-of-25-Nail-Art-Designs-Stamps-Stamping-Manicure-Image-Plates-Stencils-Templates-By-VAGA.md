<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was so excited to get this and to start doing my nails but when I started working with the plates it was bad the images are not deep enough that some wouldn&#x27;t even transfer to my nails tried with different nail polishes form the expensive ones to the cheap ones and no success just a couple of designs would transfer on to the nails. Sooo disapointed with this merchandise. not happy</li>
    <li> i like the quality of the product. the ones with lots of fine detail are a little hard but other than that very satisfy.</li>
    <li> Worked exactly as expected and prompt shipping. For those new to stamping, it does take practice so don&#x27;t give up.</li>
    <li> The set offers a great variety of designs for a lot of occasions. I personally don&#x27;t need those french tip designs, though.&lt;br /&gt;Handling is very comfortable, application is really easy.&lt;br /&gt;For a 5-star rating the designs are a little too short, so it is 4 happy stars for the \\&quot;Fairy Set\\&quot; :D&lt;br /&gt;I tried essence stamping plate - they are rubbish! I highly recommend Gals/Cheeky plates to anyone who wants to enjoy nail art!</li>
    <li> reached perfectly, which is what I got paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good I will continue purchasing this product has been very good</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the quality of these. I tend to buy only Konad plates because I&#x27;ve purchased others that don&#x27;t stamp well. I am pleasantly surprised in the quality of stamping. I do have small nail beds and short nails, so the image size isn&#x27;t an issue for me, but if I do a friend&#x27;s nails it does become one - which is why I knocked off a star.</li>
    <li> She and her friends absolutely love it!  It does take some practicing in order to get it just right... but within a few hours, they have all become experts!  Can&#x27;t wait to receive the others that I have ordered.</li>
    <li> Stamps great with any dark color.  I use over my shellac manicures with Ice Silver or Sally Hansen Black fast dry.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like that it takes weeks to be delivered. they are awesome designs though</li>
    <li> It has a lot of designs, love it!</li>
    <li> cute designs, some of the plates are not engraved deep enough and have trouble getting them to stamp. overall great deal.</li>
    <li> love these plates great images and they transfer beautiful!!</li>
    <li> So many designs to chose from! Easy to use and do! Nice collection to add to my collection of plates.</li>
    <li> To be honest, i have not used cheeky plates as of yet. Gals is the sister company, and i must say I&#x27;m impressed enough to maybe try the princes set!The full nail images are unique and very detailed. I&#x27;m also a fan of the abstract designs in this set! These plates stamp clearly onto the nail. Would recommend to anyone who loves nail art</li>
    <li> I purchased this Gals set at the same time I purchased my original Konad set. These plates were alot cheaper than the Konad plates and I really liked the designs better as well. Like the goof ball I am, I didn&#x27;t realize the plates had a protective plastic coating on them, so at first I couldn&#x27;t get&#x27;em to work. (i.e. be sure to remove the plastic coating, lol) Some of the plates seemed to be misengraved and the designs weren&#x27;t centered on the plate. The Konad plates work better than these, I believe Konad engraves their design deeper resulting in an easier pick up of the image. Either way I still use the Gals plates more often, they have a more flirty choice of images. Neither my Konad or my Gals plates have a design that completely covers my thumbnail all the way, I am still in search of the perfect image that does.  You definitely get more bang for your buck with these plates.</li>
    <li> It came faster than expected and I really like the design but they are so small, even for my tiny nails.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this.  She has so much fun with it and she is very happy with the purchase.  She is trying to do her nails with different designs and finds this Set to be one of her favorites.</li>
    <li> shipped on time. good price. a lot of variety. only complaint is some of the images with bigger sections (more polish) blow out when picked up with the stamper...or the polish doesn&#x27;t stay in the indentation when scrapping (the french tip ones are useless). but for how much konad costs...it&#x27;s still a great deal.</li>
    <li> Super happy with this set. Arrived well packed, all plates accounted for, and no defective engraving! Stamps cleanly though you do need to let some of the deeper &amp;#34;pan&amp;#34; images (like the high heel) dry for a moment before transferring to avoid smudging. Would certainly buy from this company again</li>
    <li> Um,  Amazing!  I am new to nail stamping and have over 130+ nail plates I have purchased over the past 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;( yes bit obsessed  Lol)  I love these plates, they came pretty fast within week, well packaged, nothing damaged, no scratches and they have the protective backing so no cuts.  They transfer so nicely even the very delicate and very detailed plates transfer very clear.  These are a must have for your collection. And great price!</li>
    <li> these are great plates. The fast that they are from Cheeky make them good from the start. Wish the images were a bt bigger for longer nails and wider nail bed but over all good. Good engraving and great stamping. highly recommend</li>
    <li> Item as described, love these plates!</li>
    <li> I wish they did not have the half moon cut. At this price they are a good buy, Not great.</li>
    <li> I have this set as well as the sister &amp;#34;princess&amp;#34; set. I love them both- I happen to prefer the images in the princess set mostly, but I LOVE a fair amount of the images in this one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi lights for me are the holiday images- Xmas trees, gingerbread men, snowmen, bells-- all full nail images!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also LOVE LOVE LOVE the cupcakes image!!!  Omg cupcake anything?  I AM IN!! &#x3D;0)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found the quality of these sets to be great!!  Images stamp very well and clean.  The plates themselves are good and thick, not bendy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the black backing- stays much nicer looking than the other white backing on other plates. I love love love the packaging as well- how green of GALS to put the all in a little box!!  Other sets come with each plate separately packaged in a plastic bag.  So much waste!  And annoying to pull them all out when you receive them.  With the GALS sets, all you have to do is take off the blue film (which is easy to do)!!! &#x3D;0) love that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The full nail images in these sets are smaller than I would expect- I didn&#x27;t have any problems covering my full nails with them- my nails are shorter length though (sport length?). They&#x27;re not super short, but I keep them pretty modest in length to type for my job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think these are a great value!!  Way to go, Gals!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And THANK YOU AMAZON for offering us nail polish / stamping freaks some cost effective alternatives to the expensive brands. &#x3D;0)</li>
    <li> Some of my plates seemed to have been mishandled and with scratches, but other than that the plates stamp fine.</li>
    <li> I like the first a lot of them and they work really really good I bought three and it rockfalls Walmart and they didn&#x27;t work at as good as the ones I got from you a matter fact I PMI fingers once worked for two days Chickamaw morphing out by Sean and had to play with the designs thank you so much</li>
    <li> Let me star by saying the quality of the stamp is fine but coming from cheeky I did expect more. The images do not cover your full nail bed. That disappointed me because I like the images. I almost sent them back when I got them, but I decided to watch a few YouTube videos and everyone seem pleased with them so I decided to keep them, now I wish I hadn&#x27;t. I will not buy the Princess set I have learned a lesson. I will be leaving this feedback for Cheeky as well. If you decide to get these Good luck. Thanks for your time. :) Jenny</li>
    <li> I have tried a few of the terrific nail art stamp designs included in this very nice set.  My daughters (15 &amp; 17) are soooo excited about this new bonding tool for us &amp;#34;girls!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am a beginner at nail art, and this is one of my first tools to build my kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will see posts like these from me many times.  I will put items to use as I gather them all together, from sellers I trust!</li>
    <li> The set does not disappoint for shorter or smaller nails. The full nail images are approximately 14mm from the top of the image to the top of the curve. The plate quality is great, stamp very well, and they have a nice backing so the edges aren&#x27;t too sharp. Awesome value for a small investment!</li>
    <li> Great product but took almost 2 months to arrive</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this set.  The stamps are very clear and there are so many really cute ones.  Good, clear images with the images  have used.</li>
    <li> The plates are so shallow and small that the pattern is hard to press out of the plate and doesn&#x27;t cover larger nails. Also you must be careful not to slice your fingers on the super sharp plate edge.</li>
    <li> The plates are well defined and the designs are awesome. I&#x27;m having lots of fun with these plates!! I would buy more plates from Gals. : )</li>
    <li> I love the designs on these plates.  I am having a terrible time getting a good \\&quot;all over\\&quot; stamp on my nails, a flat surface, or a fake nail.  If this is your first time using a stamping system I suggest buying a single plate to get the hang of it and see if you like it.  The single stamp designs are the only ones I&#x27;ve been able to get to stamp, and not all of those. Because I haven&#x27;t used other plates I don&#x27;t know if it is the plates, the nail polish, or if I simply need more practice. Please see my follow up comment regarding the quality of the plates vs. nail polish used.</li>
    <li> Love Stamping. Great for people like me who are not great artist...lol. Has some nice styles.</li>
    <li> This suck. So upset what I received were not Gals. They were Vaga. I don&#x27;t no how to get in touch with them.</li>
    <li> Very very small images but they transfer ok</li>
    <li> I am so sad that a lot of these images either don&#x27;t come out at all or come out with pieces of the image missing/very light. One thing I am happy about is that the snowflake plate actually comes out really well. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend getting this set just because so many of the plates don&#x27;t work, if you&#x27;re looking for a specific image, maybe just buy the plate.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this set. I was disappointed as some of the plates I was most excited to try didn&#x27;t transfer. I would say about 19/25 plates worked well.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a really good assortment of designs in this pack. Good quality, easy to use... the only thing I don&#x27;t like is having to choose!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with these! The designs are so cool and easy to use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d rather work with larger designs. These plates have too many small designs that are difficult to get onto the nail. Dissapointed with having so many hard to use prints. I think it be better for the plates to have more large type prints to be able to use. It may be that the texture of the nail polish has to be a certain way.  Im not sure.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent set. I have one place with the images running off the plate. I have contacted the company and have NOT heard back.</li>
    <li> There are several plates in this set that I use on a regular basis.  Great buy!!!!! Wished there were more sets to buy like this.</li>
    <li> Awesome collection, a great additions to any nail newbie or nail decorator professionals collection.. A must have product for anyone interested in decorating for themselves or others.</li>
    <li> These plates are smaller images like the original cheeky plates and konad plates but they stamp great and are very clear images :)</li>
    <li> These Plates Stamping Great, but the images are a little small. I can still make it work but it is a little troublesome.</li>
    <li> Amazing set. All images I&#x27;ve tried have worked wonderfully. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased since there are so many cool and fun designs to choose from!</li>
    <li> I read a review that said the edges were sharp and kind of brushed it off. I wish i had paid more attention, because as I was peeling off the film I got a cut on my middle finger that is kind of deep. Other than that though I love this product. It has so many well defined shapes that come out really well on my nails. Its just so much fun!!</li>
    <li> Great little plate set, the designs are different, not full of repeats from other lines. Gals is a sister company to Cheeky, and I jump on any plate set by Cheeky, I can say these are just as good. I have an issue getting my fleur de lis to stamp, which is the one I wanted the most, otherwise I would have rated 5 stars. (I am a seasoned stamper of over a year, so I know the ways to try to get a clear stamp, it just seems defective.) And honestly, I would have only taken off half a star for that if I could. I love this set, and recommend it, great plates for the price.</li>
    <li> I love my Image plates they arrived within a couple of days.You get so many diffrent designs Im on my third design already.If applied right you will love the out come.It&#x27;s also a great learning tool very easy too use.I would recommend this to anyone who likes diffrent designs.Why pay someone in a shop when all you have to do is order New 2013 Gals \\&quot;Fairy Set\\&quot;of 25 Nail Art Image Plates</li>
    <li> I am really happy for purchasing this plates, because they are not expensive (like BM) and are really good quality. Stamping is easy, patterns are easy to transfer with almost every nailpolish that I use. Designs are great (although I do not like those numbers). Patterns are big enough for my nails.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered them from Cheeky and got them in less than 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I hope they will add new sets in the future.</li>
    <li> The decals were ok, I would have preferred a little more smaller images rather than so many big images but, I guess thats all they had or how they come.....I personally will never order no more from this particular company unless I know for sure they are small images.</li>
    <li> These are awesome little stamping plates, they took forever to arrive but I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry. Great buy if you don&#x27;t mind the wait.</li>
    <li> The stamping plates didn&#x27;t arrived as expected.  However the designs are pretty cool and good quality. I really love them.</li>
    <li> It pains me to write this review since I love Cheeky products and I expected they&#x27;re sister company Gals to have the same quality standard however I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;First let me mention that Amazon did a horrible job packaging the plates. The first order of this item I placed a couple of days ago went missing according to UPS since the package tore. I contacted Amazon and they were nice enough to file a claim with UPS and have me place a new order after my initial refund was issued. I received the plates barely intact since I ordered it next day air. They sent it in a padded envelope with no support on the edges/ends so this is why the package tears. The plates are too heavy and they tear the bottom of the envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I opened my plates and was filming a video to post on Youtube about the designs and such. And come to find out that I received 2 duplicate plates and was missing a plate. So I contacted Cheeky and they were great at replying quickly and they told me that they would mail out the missing plate but since it was coming from China it would take approximately 25 days. I was alright with that. It was nice of them to tell me that I could keep the duplicate plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my mistake, maybe I should have tested out the plates first before bothering in contacting Cheeky for my duplicate plates and missing plates because I started stamping some images (again to post on Youtube) and ALL the images on my 4 plates that I opened were way too shallow. I was so upset. I tried different polishes, different scrapers, different stampers to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just contacted Cheeky thanking them for they&#x27;re prompt and friendly customer service but I have no need for my missing plate since I will be sending this entire set back. Again, I am very disappointed in the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only hope that the Princess set I ordered will be of better quality and the images will stamp as they should. But I wont know for another couple of weeks since they are coming from China. They are currently not available to order from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering in purchasing these plates I would wait a while until they&#x27;re quality assurance department has a second look at what they&#x27;re putting out.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the production of these plates was done too quickly to be available for the holidays?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless they wont be of any use to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update: I received my Princess set from China and I am very impressed with that set. I will write a separate review for that.&lt;br /&gt;I also received the plate I was missing as mentioned in my review from Cheeky even though I had already returned the set. But the quality is excellent on this replacement plate! I think I will take a chance and order the Fairy set again. I may have just received a fluke. In regards to customer service I give this company 5 stars!hey are coming from China.

    <li> I love the designs on this set, but they&#x27;re too small for me to use.  I do NOT have long nails.  I&#x27;ve never bought an image plate set where all the images were too small before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full plate image dimensions with the half-moon are 5/8\\&quot; long x 1/2\\&quot; wide, but if you don&#x27;t want the half-moon cutout design on your nail, the usable image size is just over 1/2\\&quot; long x 1/2\\&quot; wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you intend to use these as full-plate designs, get out a ruler and measure your nails. If they&#x27;re small enough, this is a great set of designs. And I envy you.</li>
    <li> I have this set and the Princess Set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything looks fine with them, they stamp well and I like the images as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Half Moon shape helps to make the designs in a French tip if you choose to.&lt;br /&gt;Love the price as well.</li>
    <li> Estoy muy contenta con este paq de placas son de excelente calidad y de dise&amp;ntilde;os muy bonitos y originales... Les doy mi maxima puntuaci&amp;oacute;n</li>
    <li> These where the first plates I bought. They where actually quite small as to what I thought they would be. The plates are actually smaller than the bottom of a water bottle. But they are great designs. The best I have seen online. And I loved the curved edge for French tips. My favorite is the zebra print design. They came in the mail for me in  only a few days. All around live it!</li>
    <li> some of the smaller designs don&#x27;t transfer onto the stamper.</li>
    <li> Great!!!!! Fabulous Designs</li>
    <li> OK, I have to admit that eye-hand coordination is not my strong point -- but I got beguiled by pretty pictures of stamped nails on the Internet, so I had to give it a try. I bought the Salon Express basic kit with stamper, scraper, and five plates, and ordered these as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having compared both, these are nicer plates than the one from the Salon Express kit -- the full-nail images are larger (the SE full nails are too small for even my short, narrow nails) and many of the designs are more elaborate. After only one practice session (my hint: stamp all over your old manicure before you remove it -- try five, six, seven layers of stamps to figure out how to center them and which colors show up well), I was able to give myself and my mother beautiful nail art. Seriously, my very first stamped manicure came out looking polished and professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the SE stamper and some opaque polishes not specifically made for stamping, I got beautiful results with the Gals plates and the SE plates alike -- but for variety of designs and cost per plate, the Gals set is a much better deal. There are some plates here I&#x27;ll never use, but I&#x27;m completely thrilled with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus -- the plates come in a nice little box to keep them organized and unscratched, and they are backed with paper so you won&#x27;t cut yourself. There were no duplicate or damaged plates -- I got exactly the plate shown in the product image above. And Cheeky Beauty shipped FAST, which I appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re having trouble getting good impressions, try a different polish (some are too sheer to work) and make sure you stamp quickly after you get the polish on the plate. If I can get clear, pretty, smudge-free results with these -- ANYONE CAN!</li>
    <li> Not only are the images very nice and pretty to wear on my nails they are easy to stamp with as well.  I had no problems stamping with these images.</li>
    <li> I would get this product again any time. To have the freedom and fun to do ur nails on ur time and not pay crazy prices. Love it</li>
    <li> These are awesome. Recommend to buy also shipping will be worth it as well. Came within the time promised.</li>
    <li> Work great I&#x27;m new at this and it was easy</li>
    <li> They just don&#x27;t all fit you thumb and middle fingers and you need to clean the plates well so that the nail Polish gets gets in the grooves of the design</li>
    <li> Each plate ships covered in a thin plastic protective film that must be removed before use. Some people have trouble removing that plastic, I didn&#x27;t have difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One plate was printed off-center, but all of the designs on that plate were still useable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the designs I&#x27;ve used so far have transferred really well.</li>
    <li> I like the art. I rate it 4 stars for I haven&#x27;t tried stamping with it yet. I hope I won&#x27;t be let down.</li>
    <li> Mom was talking about these and I bought them for her as a gift.  Didn&#x27;t realize you need some stamp thing to use it and these are just plates.  Should say that, could have made an extra sale.  Now I need to wait for another order before she can use them, until then she&#x27;s got a bunch of useless metal plates.&lt;br /&gt;I know all of you who buy plates and do nails will think I&#x27;m dumb for not knowing.  I&#x27;m a guy trying to do something nice.  Thanks for nothing!</li>
    <li> I love these plates...I also have the sister set,\\&quot; Princess\\&quot;....they are awesome, no issues with stamping...do not let the economical price fool you...they are of good quality and worth way more than the price.  Give them a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed !!!  Jackie</li>
    <li> 4 star rating due to the packaging. I believe that there is still room of improvement for the packaging dear Cheeky team. As for other reason, since i have not yet try out the stamping cant comment much about this product atm. :D Overall, im impressed with the cheeky team customer service. Hope to see more different design plates coming.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this set to fellow nail art stampers. The designs are beautiful and very detailed. The quality of the plates are fantastic, and for the price a great value!</li>
    <li> It comes with unique designs and all of them stamp really nicely. Love the GALS Fairy plates I recommend anyone who wants nice and cute designs in your nails to buy these plates.</li>
    <li> Stamps well but the pictures are small needed to cut my thumbnail for it to fit. Recomend for people that don´t have long long nails</li>
    <li> Love the designs and the box is great for storage and keeping plates all together. Waiting for them to come out with another set, I have 2 so far!</li>
    <li> I have both Gals Sets and they all stamped perfectly. I even used cheap WnW black polish along with a plastic scrapper (old gift card) and they all stamped perfect. I tested all of my plates and not 1 even gave me a fuss :)&lt;br /&gt;YouTube Video coming soon on these Sets :)&lt;br /&gt;Look for me...Beaching Nails</li>
    <li> This are good if you think how many you get for the price. What I dont like is that they are kinda small. the half moon shape does not help if you one to get a full coverage at once.</li>
    <li> Love these plates.Stamp Great.GALS Rock....&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more.&amp;#34;Fairy Set&amp;#34; is my fav. now.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;A great buy...</li>
    <li> I bought both Fairy Set and Princess Set and have no complaints with either; they both stamp well and have loads of cool designs.  Lots of full size images which are handy to use for a quick mani.  The box is handy to keep them all together for storage and travelling!</li>
    <li> the pictures dont do these plates justice! They stamp Beautiful images! I am for sure going to buy me some more!</li>
    <li> some of them work and other dont.</li>
    <li> I received the item damaged. There was deep gauges and scratches all over &amp; over the stamping image parts. Completely unusable.&lt;br /&gt;What a shame. I wanted the item replaced, but amazon only accepts returns on this item.</li>
    <li> The fairy set had nothing to do with fairy&#x27;s at all..</li>
    <li> I love that stamping plates are becoming mainstream and more designs are being created other than flowers. These plates are an amazing price for your money and you will wow your friends when they continuously ask you where you get your manicures done at. The plates are high quality and stamps transfer without a problem. They also have great customer service.</li>
    <li> I loved these plates. They are a little smaller than other brands, so the images are smaller, but my fingers are small anyway so it does not bother me. Would not work for larger nails though.</li>
    <li> These are great quality. I just used a plain over the counter .99 white polish. You can see the word &amp;#34;Kisses&amp;#34; perfect. I also have the Princess Set.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself and then turned around and got it for my 13 year old sis-in law.  Lots of unique designs and yes they are a tad bit small but I found that a lot of the full nail plates are ones where you can easily fill in the wholes and no one would be the wiser.  Not like a fishnet design where if it doesn&#x27;t line up then it&#x27;s super noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;d recommend this set, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> remember to take the blue plastic off... and they work great! make sure you have enough paint to fill all the grooves and press firm  when printing. i did use a gift card to scrape in stead of the provided scraper. also bought the mash double sided stamp.</li>
    <li> though I have not tried all the plates yet, the ones I have tried are fairly easy and transfer well. There is a learning curve to using any nail image plates, especially if you&#x27;re not using the special nail art polish :(. I found the product to be enjoyable, pretty on the nails, and inexpensive. All you have to do is have a little imagination, pull out the polish, and have a fun &amp;#34;girl&#x27;s day&amp;#34; making great nail art designs.</li>
    <li> i must warn you all i do not recommend it for big nails only for short nails, but other than that the designs are beautiful but only work with nail polish of sinful colors and the xl stamper other than that amazing and these two supplements needed to stamp well are worth it because they work with every single plate out there.</li>
    <li> I really like the Gals &amp;#34;Fairy Set&amp;#34; stamping plates. The best part about them is that the plates are larger than any other on the market and this makes applying the polish and stamping them much easier. I don&#x27;t like the clean up process but over all its a great product and they have tons of designs so you will be creating for hours.</li>
    <li> Fun designs, stamp well. No problems with what I have tried so far. Having a good time playing with these plates. Bought these with the princes set and I&#x27;m enjoying them all.</li>
    <li> My 12 year old loves this product - she is the hit of her middle school.  Easy to use, definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love nail art and for the price this is a bargain!!!!!  Sooo many different designs makes me want to do my nails everyday :)</li>
    <li> I really like these - I have had no problem with transfer- my only complaint is that the many french tips are all the same size and many are just too large for me to use. I don&#x27;t quite know why it was called a Fairy set when there are no fairies- and only a couple of butterflies. There are a bunch of wild animals, like elephants and penguins...but there are also a lot of damask designs and fancy curly cues, which is why I bought it and they work well. Very glad I got this set.</li>
    <li> I have no problems with these plates so far... Just remember to remove the blue film before using and clean your plates with acetone after each use. Btw, they scratch easy so use a old gift card not the scraper that ones with your kits.... Enjoy this worthy buy!</li>
    <li> The plates are good quality, I have not had any issues with the images being too shallow. The plates are definitely thinner than other ones that I already have but they do the job just as good! I would buy this brand again</li>
    <li> If you like Cheeky stamping plates then you have to get these. They are their sister company and the designs are adorable. I got these just a couple days ago. I literally ordered them the 1st day they were available and I love them.  I did a cute snowman &amp; snowflake design this week and can&#x27;t wait to do more.  I played around with a lot of them the day I got them and just can&#x27;t express how much I like them. I have quite a few other sets and these are on the top of my list. I can&#x27;t wait to get the princess set.</li>
    <li> Love the patterns in this set, they are very geometric and individual. Its a nice complementary set to the Gals &amp;#34;Princess Set&amp;#34; which is more feminine</li>
    <li> I had really high expectations when I ordered this set.&lt;br /&gt;I have relatively small nails, but these motives are so ridiculously small that I simply can&#x27;t use most of the set. I&#x27;m sorry to say that this was a waste of money for me. Only buy this set if you have got tiny nails!</li>
    <li> i bought it because i liked the designs for stamping, now i&#x27;m using two of the images in my nails and everybody ask me how i did it</li>
    <li> I got mine today and love them! I am still learning the technique, but the plates are fantastic! No repeats, and I&#x27;ve used each of them once to ensure they were etched deep enough. I will say that these are smaller than I thought they&#x27;d be. My nails are about 1/4 out from the tip of my finger, and the design doesn&#x27;t extend to that. (I have really small hands, so I didn&#x27;t think it would be a problem when I read the dimensions).</li>
    <li> This company just has the best plates and series of plates. I will continue to get their plates every time a new series comes out. They are well made, have very nice backers to keep fingers safe and have images that appeal to all ages.</li>
</ol>
