<li> Very small</li>
<li> Wasn&#x27;t crazy about this scent after all</li>
<li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
<li> It has a youthful floral scent with a hint of honeysuckle, but doesn&#x27;t smell like some of the awful body sprays or perfumes you might find tweens and teenagers dousing on.</li>

    <li> Wasn&#x27;t crazy about this scent after all</li>
    <li> It was just toooo tiny. Needed a bigger size.</li>
    <li> I like the way it smells and it last all day. Now I can purchase this in a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> My new favorite summer scent.  This is a very SMALL bottle of perfume,  a little smaller than a silver dollar.  Also, it&#x27;s NOT a spray bottle which I like since it&#x27;s so small.  If it were a spray bottle it would be empty after about 2-3 sprays if that. I do think it was overpriced but I like the scent and will get the regular size when this runs out. Quick shipping!</li>
    <li> i love this my only problem is i have to use my fingers to put it on,that can be a bit much but it smells awesome and it last long..i would recommend</li>
    <li> it is small, just like description says. Unfortunately, there is no rollerball or spray, but it still smells great. I&#x27;ll probably buy a bigger one next time. Delivery came on time, package was fine</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent ever. Such a fun and light scent. I wouldn&#x27;t wear it to a fancy dinner, but for my ordinary life it&#x27;s perfect and picks me up as soon as I put it on!</li>
    <li> This fragrance is light , floral and crisp.&lt;br /&gt;It can be worn by any age from teen to senior .</li>
    <li> Used it up finally the other day. it smells nice but not as strong as It could be but if you wear it at night for your spouse they will smell it upon snuggles and kisses.</li>
    <li> Just a reminder, the bottle is really tiny... It makes for a great (small) gift.</li>
    <li> Very nice fragrance... I would recommend it to anyone anyday...</li>
    <li> The picture can be deceiving. It is half the size of my pinky finger and my pinky finger is about 4 inches.</li>
    <li> I was surprised that I received this product within days. Very small bottle that has a pull off top. Not able to carry with me the top may come off. But the smell is absolutely amazing!!!  Would recommend another size. The Roll on is great!</li>
    <li> I bought this tiny sample after reading the scent notes.  I was not disappointed.  I love this cologne but it does not last long.  Perhaps in a perfume form or layer with skin lotion would last longer.</li>
    <li> For granddaughter. Good price. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Have tried this and like it; a little sweet but it will be nice for the Spring.  Cute little bottle although I do prefer spray bottles for cologne.</li>
    <li> Very small but it was a great sample size to &#x27;try out&#x27; the scent, which I ended up loving and have moved on the the large bottle. I wear this perfume every day and get complements on it all the time. I pick up powdery scents and this perfume is nice and light without going to powdery on me.</li>
    <li> have been wearing this for a while bought the small one for my purse.</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCE!</li>
    <li> Now she also made me fall in love w/ this product.  Swift delivery-all went very smoothly and the product arrived in great condition.</li>
    <li> Does not smell like Daisy by Marc Jacobs. Whatever this scent it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t last long... I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a pro or con...</li>
    <li> I gave it 5 stars because I love the smell. The bottle is as small as the pic shows</li>
    <li> I was supposed to be in spray form.  Spilled all over my purse.</li>
    <li> It was purchased as a stocking stuffer</li>
    <li> Before I bought this perfume I had a card sprayed with it, from a major department store.  It was in my purse for almost a week and I could smell the perfume for at least 3 days, on that spray card.  Instead of buying a large bottle I decided to try a small version to try out.  I ordered &amp; received the perfume and loved the smell, however, the scent did not seem to last even half of the day.  I asked my friends &amp; my husband if they could smell my perfume, by the end of the day. No one could smell it.  It was not just me.  I was very disappointed.  I will buy the one at the department store.  Not sure what happened. ~ Jeannie</li>
    <li> Too expensive, it really isn&#x27;t that great!</li>
    <li> I love how this smells on my girlfriend. It&#x27;s her favorite!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the purchase.  Have purchased this in a larger size.  For adult Easter baskets added these to ladies&#x27; gifts for a big smile from each recipient.  Nice fragrance.  No one is overwhelmed. Lots of complements.</li>
    <li> It was smaller than I expected and to exspensive for the amount.But I do thank Amazon for getting it to me so fast it was a birthday present for a friend :)</li>
    <li> This is such a fresh, light scent. Truly lovely to smell! If you like smelling fresh and lovely, you will love this fragrance.</li>
    <li> Quick sample, smells great! if you apply the appropriate amount, it should last a 3 weeks if applied once a day. It has a youthful floral scent with a hint of honeysuckle, but doesn&#x27;t smell like some of the awful body sprays or perfumes you might find tweens and teenagers dousing on. If you&#x27;re an adult that like lights scents or you have a young girl in your life that has good taste, this is a perfect little gift!</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift, my sister loves it.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!!! it is by far my favorite smell!</li>
