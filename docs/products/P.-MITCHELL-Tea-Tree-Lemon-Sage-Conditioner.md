### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best thickening conditioner I ever used.</li>
      <li>Love it !!!</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells great and works great!</li>
      <li>Great price.</li>
      <li>Works and smells great</li>
      <li>and I hope it&#x27;s great conditioner...</li>
      <li>Smells great, seems to work well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It works great.</li>
      <li>great stuff hair is thicker and the lemon sage smell is so wonderful love</li>
      <li>This product is amazing!</li>
      <li>and I did not notice anything remarkable about my hair.</li>
      <li>Good Shampoo &amp; Conditioner</li>
      <li>Nice product and good customer service.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner!  </li>
      <li>Love this product!  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
      <li>But I love all PM products, so it gets a 4 out of respect...</li>
      <li>Continually use this stuff - I love it.</li>
      <li>Regrettably, this product was just okay.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>Have determined that the way it makes the hair thicker is to separate out the strands more, creating the illusion of more coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The smell is great, and my hair is soft and does not tangle as easily.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>I love buying a large bottle of product that has a pump on it which is super convenient!</li>
      <li>It does what a good basic conditioner should.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
      <li>and I really feel it gives it umph!</li>
      <li>It did exactly what it said it would do...thicken my hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Originally I wasn&#x27;t sure if that method would really be beneficial, especially having come from so many other methods that actually thicken the diameter of your hair itself, temporarily most often.</li>
      <li>I like it, I really do.</li>
      <li>First, the ingredients listed on the back of the bottle say absolutely nothing about lemon or sage as ingredients.</li>
      <li>I couple it with the Paul Mitchell Awapui shampoo and am convinced that the combo cleans and visually thickens my hair better than any other method I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft and not dried out.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re a guy and really losing your hair and want an actual solution</li>
      <li>In fact, I did not see any natural ingredients listed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed massive improvements in the quality of my hair, both thickness, softness, and shine, when I use it directly after a shampoo and the day after (no shampoo).</li>
      <li>so maybe it&#x27;s better for those with thin hair that actually need it.</li>

<li> so maybe it&#x27;s better for those with thin hair that actually need it.</li>
<li> It volumizes the hair and at the same time it doesn&#x27;t dry the hair out.</li>
<li> it gives my very fine, very thin hair some body without weighing it down or making it look oily.</li>
<li> In fact, the two subsequent &amp;#34;conditioner only&amp;#34; days I have before another shampooing leave my hair less thinned otu from another shampoo than would be standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Thickening on the other hand, not happening.</li>
<li> /&gt;Leaves my hair very soft and seems to avoid leaving a residue behind.</li>
<li> I love this conditioner but it would be worthless without the hair that Propecia regrew.</li>
<li> My hair seems a little thicker now.</li>
<li> Only problem is the pump was broken</li>
<li> I&#x27;m going through menopause, and my hair was starting to thin at 51 years of age.  </li>
<li> Less hair falls out and hair feels thicker!</li>
<li> It did dry out my hair really bad especially if I don&#x27;t use a lot.</li>
<li> Now it looks twice as thick.  </li>
<li> The tea tree lemon sage didn&#x27;t seem to thicken my hair, but my hair is also already moderately thick</li>
<li> Also the bottle showed up damaged, not sure if that was due to packaging, or that is was so dang cold once it got to Iowa.</li>
<li> I have really bad dandruff and must use a medical shampoo every 3 days to control it.</li>
<li> The product itself is really thin</li>
<li> Sadly it does not meet the claims on the label.</li>
<li> Just sad that it came in a bad bottle...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is amazing!</li>
    <li> I will never use another shampoo. I have fine hair and I really feel it gives it umph!</li>
    <li> Works and smells great</li>
    <li> The tea tree lemon sage didn&#x27;t seem to thicken my hair, but my hair is also already moderately thick so maybe it&#x27;s better for those with thin hair that actually need it. It did dry out my hair really bad especially if I don&#x27;t use a lot. The product itself is really thin and you need a lot for it to condition at all.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Bit pricey.  It&#x27;s an indulgence.</li>
    <li> Nice product and good customer service.</li>
    <li> I have really bad dandruff and must use a medical shampoo every 3 days to control it. It strips my hair a lot, dulling and thinning it. I dislike after shower hair products and gels, so this was recommended to me as an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great. I&#x27;ve noticed massive improvements in the quality of my hair, both thickness, softness, and shine, when I use it directly after a shampoo and the day after (no shampoo). In fact, the two subsequent &amp;#34;conditioner only&amp;#34; days I have before another shampooing leave my hair less thinned otu from another shampoo than would be standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d go with this over the standard tea-tree if you need to shampoo often. That is, unless, you dislike lemony smells that don&#x27;t persist after rinsing.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t tried it! But I love all PM products, so it gets a 4 out of respect...</li>
    <li> great stuff hair is thicker and the lemon sage smell is so wonderful love it</li>
    <li> Regrettably, this product was just okay. First, the ingredients listed on the back of the bottle say absolutely nothing about lemon or sage as ingredients. In fact, I did not see any natural ingredients listed. I have used this product five times and I did not notice anything remarkable about my hair. I am African American with 4A shoulder length hair. The product was packaged well and arrived on time in Kuwait.</li>
    <li> I love buying a large bottle of product that has a pump on it which is super convenient! Only problem is the pump was broken off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used it yet and I hope it&#x27;s great conditioner... Just sad that it came in a bad bottle...</li>
    <li> I like it, I really do. The smell is great, and my hair is soft and does not tangle as easily. Thickening on the other hand, not happening. Which is why it only gets 3 stars. It&#x27;s okay. It does what a good basic conditioner should. Sadly it does not meet the claims on the label. Also the bottle showed up damaged, not sure if that was due to packaging, or that is was so dang cold once it got to Iowa.</li>
    <li> like the way it was package!!!</li>
    <li> Good Shampoo &amp; Conditioner</li>
    <li> This does the same job as the pricy salon product recommended by my stylist.  Have been using it for two years,&lt;br /&gt;and it gives my very fine, very thin hair some body without weighing it down or making it look oily.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner!  It did exactly what it said it would do...thicken my hair.  I&#x27;m going through menopause, and my hair was starting to thin at 51 years of age.  Now it looks twice as thick.  I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this product again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Continually use this stuff - I love it. Have determined that the way it makes the hair thicker is to separate out the strands more, creating the illusion of more coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally I wasn&#x27;t sure if that method would really be beneficial, especially having come from so many other methods that actually thicken the diameter of your hair itself, temporarily most often. I won&#x27;t be switching back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair very soft and seems to avoid leaving a residue behind. I couple it with the Paul Mitchell Awapui shampoo and am convinced that the combo cleans and visually thickens my hair better than any other method I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a guy and really losing your hair and want an actual solution then ask your doc about Propecia. I love this conditioner but it would be worthless without the hair that Propecia regrew.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
    <li> Smells great, seems to work well. My hair seems a little thicker now.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells great and works great! Less hair falls out and hair feels thicker!</li>
    <li> This is the best thickening conditioner I ever used. It volumizes the hair and at the same time it doesn&#x27;t dry the hair out. Love it !!!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Leaves my hair soft and not dried out.</li>
