      <li>boosted with this pheromone blend, and it is a perfect pairing.</li>
      <li>Great product!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using pheromones for about 4 years now, and this blend is one of the very best!!  </li>
      <li>I have this in the spray form and find that for me to get the best self effects, I use 4 sprays, one on my torso, neck, and arms.</li>
      <li>Excellent!</li>
      <li>I feel so amazing when I wear it, like a goddess!!  </li>
      <li>This has to be one of the BEST pheromone the Potion Master (Mara) has created (one of the MANY by Mara)!!</li>
      <li>La Femme Mystere is a good one to start with, and is liquid gold!</li>
      <li>A good scent to wear if you wish to ask someone to do something for you, of course, you may not even need to ask!</li>
      <li>This was a beautiful fragrance</li>
      <li>Admiring stares are not at all uncommon when I wear La Femme Mystere.</li>
      <li>La Femme Mystere is a great phero to use if you are like me, &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; to their use and application.</li>
      <li>friends\\&quot; &#x27;LOL, I think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s known as a \\&quot;hit\\&quot;&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have this pheromone blend in oil, and I have to say it&#x27;s a great blend.</li>
      <li>It makes you feel happy and carefree and is a blend that gives off great self effects and gives you that air of confidence.</li>
      <li>THIS...is one amazing unscented Phero blend!</li>
      <li>Some have gone out of their way to be nice to me!  </li>
      <li>Just a swipe on my torso and a dab split between wrists, and I am good to go.</li>
      <li>I wear Pheros for the self effects, but the effect some have on others is surprising.</li>
      <li>Thus it is good for work.  </li>
      <li>I wore this one on a very special evening out and experienced the most incredible reactions from people.</li>
      <li>This one makes me feel incredible, euphoric almost, confident and sexy.</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a phero that will give you a boost of confidence, glamour aura, make you feel even more feminine, this is the one for you!</li>
      <li>A Love Potion must have!</li>
      <li>Love Potion Magickal Perfumerie has to offer!</li>
      <li>Pheros from Love Potion are amazing!</li>
      <li>Like &#x27;I want to worship you because you are amazing&#x27;.</li>
      <li>The blend is really nice.  </li>
      <li>I gave my honest review and Amazon&#x27;s verified purchase.</li>
      <li>Still loving this product.</li>
      <li>I recommend you do your own research.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I gave my honest review and Amazon&#x27;s verified purchase.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a real head-turner and a great confidence booster!</li>
      <li>and I feel confident and SEXY !</li>
      <li>LPMP has some incredible pheros, but they really knocked it out of the park with this one.</li>
      <li>On the bright side, this phero blend seems to really agitate my soon to be ex Monster-in-law, so I do make it a point to where this when I have to deal with her, lmao!</li>
      <li>I liked all of them but the Copper is my favorite.</li>
      <li>When I wear it, I feel like I&#x27;m more effective in my communication,and that I&#x27;m listened to more.</li>
      <li>I have tried many of Love Potion&#x27; s Phero blends and speaking from my own experience, this one qualifies as something akin to magic in a bottle.</li>
      <li>People want to get close and try to learn more about her.</li>
      <li>Le Femme Mystere is one of those pheros that you will probably end up using more for yourself rather than the effects it has on others.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about a year now, and absolutely LOVE it.</li>
      <li>Not only do LPMP phero products work, but they are of the highest quality and are sold by an excellent company.  </li>
      <li>received mini samples of scented variations of this product from the&lt;br /&gt;company which was wonderful for future purchases!</li>
      <li>However, with that said, sometimes the person who most needs to receive the effect is the person wearing it</li>
      <li>When I pair it with on of my favorite Love Potion Scents, I feel even more in control.</li>
      <li>When I wear it, I feel so sexy and in control of every aspect of my life.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite pheromones because of the self effects that I get from it.</li>
      <li>glad Truth called this out.</li>
      <li>I have Love Potion&#x27;s &amp;quot;Nola&amp;quot;</li>
      <li>:)Still one of my favorite go-to pheromones for any occasion.</li>
      <li>I very much enjoy wearing La Femme Mystere, I call it my \\&quot;confidence in a bottle\\&quot;!</li>
      <li>She doesn&#x27;t trade on sex appeal, though she is appealing; people take an interest in her because she is simply interesting.  </li>
      <li>For those in the pheromone world, I love AD&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Still one of my favorite go-to pheromones for any occasion.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had more experience with LFM (almost four months now) and with writing reviews, so I cleaned some things up and added info about how I apply it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell on this one...</li>
      <li>, you don&#x27;t just put a Phero on and say ok go...</li>
      <li>She hasn&#x27;t laid out all her cards on the table, and it&#x27;s this that leaves all around her wanting more.</li>
      <li>I love how people want to get closer to me too.</li>
      <li>When I wear this the effects are mostly SELF effects, I wear it for ME</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite pheromones.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite Pheros.  </li>
      <li>This is sophisticated lady in a bottle -- a sashaying woman who knows her own mind and worth... and everyone else knows it now, too!</li>
      <li>This particular pheromone blend is probably the best all-around, unscented enhancer for a variety of occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love Potion Magickal Perfumerie has available.</li>
      <li>i need to test it more to find my sweet spot :)</li>
      <li>And It gives a good aura good vibes and you will look more approachable to other people...</li>
      <li>Since my original purchases here I have purchased from LOVEPOTIONMAGICKALPERFUMERIE many times.</li>
      <li>People, men and women alike, are friendly and attentive, and truly attracted to me when I wear this!  </li>
      <li>Since my original purchases here I have purchased from LOVEPOTIONMAGICKALPERFUMERIE many times.</li>
      <li>Even though it took me awhile to find my sweet spot, I&#x27;m so glad I bought LFM.</li>
      <li>One important note on pheromones</li>
      <li>but I do enjoy the self effects of LFM when I do.</li>
      <li>I have it unscented and blended at 2x strength with a scent, and I enjoy them both.</li>
      <li>I found myself VERY well received by all those I encountered and especially nice, it seemed to make those around me feel the same sort of blissfulness that I felt.</li>
      <li>I found this small boutique business which made excellent perfumes and sell some containing pheromone blends.</li>
      <li>and  everyone was so friendly and chatty.</li>
      <li>and so it is good for social situations.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s a great start if you&#x27;re new to pheromones, so I would highly recommend Le Femme</li>
      <li>/&gt;The only trick is getting your ideal amount right so as to get consistent results.</li>
      <li>This phero is pure gold in my household, and the one I most often carry around in my purse when I am out and about.</li>
      <li>I enjoy pheromones as much for the self-effects as for the effect on others, and this one wins on both counts!!  </li>
      <li>I am by no means, full of myself, and this one did in no way make me feel full of myself, but</li>
      <li>I felt very feminine and a bit sexy</li>
      <li>And the part about smelling like you don&#x27;t bathe if you wear it in your hair or around your neck is completely true.</li>
      <li>Although it can be steered in *that* particular direction, I have used it on many occasions from family gathers to just running errands, and gotten plenty of positive and respectful interactions.</li>
      <li>OK I&#x27;m new to the phero field but have quickly become a huge fan of LP Perfumes.  </li>
      <li>The first time I tried the unscented version, I covered it with another Love Potion scent that works for me (Betrothal) and went to the hotel reception to nicely complain about the constant mechanical noise in the bathroom and lack of wifi strength in the room.</li>
      <li>The fact that this business has a loyal clientele speaks well for its reputation.</li>
      <li>The fact that this business has a loyal clientele speaks well for its reputation.</li>
      <li>It definitely makes me feel more confident when i wear it.</li>
      <li>It seems to have an effect on me that I am calm, cool and collected.  </li>
      <li>A couple of spritzes of LFM underneath my fragrance of the day makes me feel more grounded, receptive of other&#x27;s opinions while fearlessly expressing my own.</li>
      <li>Not to say I become brash; just more comfortable in my own skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is one of my new favorite go tos.</li>
      <li>They are more keyed-in, though in a respectful, social manner that doesn&#x27;t cross the line into oogling or deer-in-the-headlights like with stronger sexual blends.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely appropriate enough for most work situations, and for me doesn&#x27;t provide a strong sexual edge like some of the other blends</li>
      <li>The feeling is all about what I can do rather than what I can make others feel and that is a powerful</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is one of my favorite Pheros.  It seems to have an effect on me that I am calm, cool and collected.  The effect it has on others is that people are nicer than usual.  Some have gone out of their way to be nice to me!  I wear Pheros for the self effects, but the effect some have on others is surprising.</li>
    <li> La Femme Mystere (LFM) is the first pheromone I ever tried. It was in a perfume \\&quot;Goddess of the Blue Moon\\&quot; that I purchased here on Amazon from Love Potion Magickal Perfumerie. This was a beautiful fragrance and I was glad to get a second bottle before it sold out.&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m here to talk about this pheromone so let&#x27;s do it...&lt;br /&gt;I had done a little research on pheros before my first purchase, mostly at first for safety, some companies are pretty shady. I found this small boutique business which made excellent perfumes and sell some containing pheromone blends. I gave them a try with my first purchases through Amazon. The first thing I noticed with LFM are the \\&quot;self effects\\&quot;. I felt very feminine and a bit sexy,it just gave me a lift in general. All throughout the day interactions with people, store clearks,friends and my kids doctor went over well. There was just this added something..conversations lasted longer and  everyone was so friendly and chatty. After a lively talk with my kids doctor we hugged ....It hit me as we left the office..I&#x27;m thinking WTH. I wondered if he thought the same thing. It felt natural at the time, but afterwards my son says \\&quot;wow didn&#x27;t know you were good friends\\&quot; &#x27;LOL, I think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s known as a \\&quot;hit\\&quot;&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear pheromone products everyday but I do enjoy the self effects of LFM when I do. The social effects and reactions range from the more obvious ( as described) to more subtle. One important note on pheromones, you don&#x27;t just put a Phero on and say ok go...come get me. The pheromones accentuate, give you a boost. You have to bring something to the party.&lt;br /&gt;This Phero has NO odor. I believe another reviewer confused pheromones and couplins they get grouped together but are not the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;You can wear this unscented blend with your favourite fragrance. As with anyone New to pheromones I recommend you do your own research.&lt;br /&gt;Try this business&#x27; website to get started. I find this a reliable, reputable small business with quality products. End Of Review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to mention here that I don&#x27;t often review, It generally takes time I don&#x27;t have. I, among others came to show support for a small business I adore and trust. I gave my honest review and Amazon&#x27;s verified purchase. I believe everyone&#x27;s entitled to their opinion but I also believe there&#x27;s some odd activity, perhaps a competitors compulsion or someone more interested in trolling than doing their own homework. Since my original purchases here I have purchased from LOVEPOTIONMAGICKALPERFUMERIE many times. This small american business has a devoted clientele, in the US and abroad. The fact that this business has a loyal clientele speaks well for its reputation. I&#x27;d invite anyone curious to check their website and see for themselves.l business with quality products.

    <li> Le Femme Mystere is one of those pheros that you will probably end up using more for yourself rather than the effects it has on others.  When I wear this, it makes me feel confident, stand taller and feel a little sexier. It makes me feel like I am in control, relaxed and that I hold the power to sway. The feeling is all about what I can do rather than what I can make others feel and that is a powerful feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only seen a few small hits in terms of effects on others so I can&#x27;t say whether I think it works in that respect.  However, with that said, sometimes the person who most needs to receive the effect is the person wearing it and if you are looking for something that will give you a boost, I do believe that this stuff will do just that!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this pheromone blend unscented since the first time I got it in a scent my skin chemistry turned the scent into a less than pleasant smell. The first time I tried the unscented version, I covered it with another Love Potion scent that works for me (Betrothal) and went to the hotel reception to nicely complain about the constant mechanical noise in the bathroom and lack of wifi strength in the room. I had applied it on the back of my hands and made sure to keep my hands on the reception desk in front of the supervisor. 10 minutes later, our hotel rate was dropped almost 10%, he gave us my company employee rate despite the fact that I had not booked the hotel through my company, and took off 2 nights from the final invoice! Wow! Thank you LP and LFM, I am sold!</li>
    <li> This is one of my new favorite go tos. At first I had a hard time finding my sweet spot, but after a few tests, voila, I &#x27;got&#x27; it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name and description say it all. I&#x27;ve worn in a variety of situations with very positive responses. It really gives you that aura of mystique. Another must have winner from LP!</li>
    <li> For those in the pheromone world, I love AD&#x27;s IS/B. I adore the &amp;#34;Marilyn&amp;#34; affects it gives me. I ordered LFM to get something like that affect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#x27;s different, but I like it. When it arrived, I put it on went to run some errands. I was assertive, yet not a bitch. I got my point across well and didn&#x27;t overthink things (like I normally do). It was the funniest thing in the world to me since I didn&#x27;t expect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pheromones aren&#x27;t for everyone because they simply enhance who you are. You can&#x27;t expect them to do all of the work FOR you.</li>
    <li> Oh that includes me...  I got this one from their shop and thought I would give a review here... Thank you so much... I love the smell on this one... it&#x27;s Unscented but somehow theres a hint of fruity smell... TO ME! And It gives a good aura good vibes and you will look more approachable to other people... Love this one and the Blatant Invitation... I use them both together or this one at work setting....</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the BEST pheromone the Potion Master (Mara) has created (one of the MANY by Mara)!! I wear it nearly every day and if I&#x27;m feeling kicky and care free...I wear the 2x version (double potency). When I wear this the effects are mostly SELF effects, I wear it for ME and I feel confident and SEXY ! This is a MUST HAVE in any woman&#x27;s arsenal.</li>
    <li> THIS...is one amazing unscented Phero blend! I have tried many of Love Potion&#x27; s Phero blends and speaking from my own experience, this one qualifies as something akin to magic in a bottle. I wore this one on a very special evening out and experienced the most incredible reactions from people. Male and female, social and attraction wise. I am by no means, full of myself, and this one did in no way make me feel full of myself, but I *did* experience a level of confidence and even blisffulness with this blend that gave me a much needed ego boost. I found myself VERY well received by all those I encountered and especially nice, it seemed to make those around me feel the same sort of blissfulness that I felt. I am not one who is receptive to placebo suggestion, so it is the real thing as far as I am concerned. It truly does lend an air of mystique and attraction and positive feelings. I would merely suggest that you choose a compatable scent to wear it with well. The night I am referring to, I chose a very exotic perfume to wear it with and they seemed to act as catalysts to each other&#x27;s properties. Bottom line. I KNOW this works and I hope they never discontinue it!!! LPMP has some incredible pheros, but they really knocked it out of the park with this one. Excellent!</li>
    <li> This phero gives me a boost of confidence- makes me feel cool and mysterious. It almost makes me feel cocky if I over apply. This makes people seem fascinated by you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year now, and absolutely LOVE it. Not only do LPMP phero products work, but they are of the highest quality and are sold by an excellent company.  And no, this and the other reviews are not \\&quot;fake,\\&quot; as an earlier reviewer so sadly suggested. I do not know what motivated Ms \\&quot;Fake Reviews\\&quot; to make her groundless accusations, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t the pursuit of \\&quot;truth.\\&quot; I wholeheartedly invite her to try LPMP pheros, because I believe she would really like them.  La Femme Mystere is a good one to start with, and is liquid gold!</li>
    <li> OK I&#x27;m new to the phero field but have quickly become a huge fan of LP Perfumes.  With that being said, I have been trying several of the pheromone lines for fun, both in unscented and perfume blends.  I&#x27;ve quickly become a believer in the &amp;#34;science&amp;#34; behind these, only because I do see and feel the effects on myself and others.  La Femme Mystere is a great phero to use if you are like me, &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; to their use and application. It&#x27;s great combining with other scents for the workplace or in social situations where you want to exude confidence and feminity.</li>
    <li> I have this pheromone blend in oil, and I have to say it&#x27;s a great blend. It puts a little bounce in my step, lifts my mood, and makes me feel ladylike, graceful, sexy and in-control. Admiring stares are not at all uncommon when I wear La Femme Mystere. It&#x27;s a real head-turner and a great confidence booster!</li>
    <li> I have this in an alcohol spray, which I use over my perfume oils. I find no scent discernible from the product itself. I really love this, it adds a little something to any day, any occasion. I have found it creates friendly effects with a little awe/admiration thrown in, but not in a way that is overly scary/dominant. Like &#x27;I want to worship you because you are amazing&#x27;. A good scent to wear if you wish to ask someone to do something for you, of course, you may not even need to ask!</li>
    <li> I very much enjoy wearing La Femme Mystere, I call it my \\&quot;confidence in a bottle\\&quot;! When I wear it, I feel like I&#x27;m more effective in my communication,and that I&#x27;m listened to more. I feel more centered and overall efficient.I keep an extra bottle of this at work.</li>
    <li> This phero is pure gold in my household, and the one I most often carry around in my purse when I am out and about. I affectionately refer to it as my bottled confidence. A couple of spritzes of LFM underneath my fragrance of the day makes me feel more grounded, receptive of other&#x27;s opinions while fearlessly expressing my own. It delivers a sharpening of my social senses and aids in clearer and more effective communication, and nearly erases any twinges of unnecessary self doubt in even the most unfamiliar situations. Not to say I become brash; just more comfortable in my own skin.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this phero, as well as the many other lovely treats Love Potion Magickal Perfumerie has to offer!</li>
    <li> These reviews do look fake.  Check out all the comments to the one star review by \\&quot;Truth\\&quot;.  Notice the time stamps of the responses - same day....same time zone.....wow, what a coincidence! What do you think the chances are that every person who has reviewed this product has responded to a negative review on exactly the same day from the same time zone?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a sample:&lt;br /&gt;H. Miller Posted on Feb 8, 2013 6:03:45 AM PST&lt;br /&gt;Cabraun Posted on Feb 8, 2013 6:13:58 AM PST&lt;br /&gt;A. M. Bentz Posted on Feb 8, 2013 6:13:58 AM PST&lt;br /&gt;R.

Too bad, too. When I see this sort of deception, I question the authenticity of the product.  Because deception shouldn&#x27;t be necessary if a product is *that* great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad Truth called this out.</li>
    <li> Even though it took me awhile to find my sweet spot, I&#x27;m so glad I bought LFM. If you are looking for a phero that will give you a boost of confidence, glamour aura, make you feel even more feminine, this is the one for you!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Mix it with my daily perfume and it gives me a feeling of confidence throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;Also received mini samples of scented variations of this product from the&lt;br /&gt;company which was wonderful for future purchases!</li>
    <li> After my failed forays into other perfume and pheromone retailers, I stumbled across Love Potion&#x27;s treasure trove of girly super serums.  And thank goodness! This particular pheromone blend is probably the best all-around, unscented enhancer for a variety of occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider La Femme Mystere a solid \\&quot;social\\&quot; pheromone blend, meaning I&#x27;ve found it safe enough to wear in just about any environment without things getting weird or sexually charged. Although it can be steered in *that* particular direction, I have used it on many occasions from family gathers to just running errands, and gotten plenty of positive and respectful interactions. It&#x27;s definitely appropriate enough for most work situations, and for me doesn&#x27;t provide a strong sexual edge like some of the other blends Love Potion Magickal Perfumerie has available. Overall, folks definitely seem more attentive during interactions when I wear this. They are more keyed-in, though in a respectful, social manner that doesn&#x27;t cross the line into oogling or deer-in-the-headlights like with stronger sexual blends. It&#x27;s really just lovely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note, this stuff is concentrated--with 1,000 mcg per bottle, it&#x27;s more than most other pheromone blends I&#x27;ve bought to date. And a little goes a long way. So despite wanting to slather it on, I have to remind myself that less is more. When applying, I usually roll a finger&#x27;s length beneath both ears and one more in my cleavage. If I&#x27;m wearing no sleeves, I&#x27;ll roll an inch in the crook of each elbow. Basically the warmest places I can find to help diffuse the pheromones. \\&quot;Hits\\&quot; and enhanced reactions are pretty consistent with this method, so I like to stick with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s a great start if you&#x27;re new to pheromones, so I would highly recommend Le Femme Mystere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Edited 1/13/15] I&#x27;ve had more experience with LFM (almost four months now) and with writing reviews, so I cleaned some things up and added info about how I apply it. Still one of my favorite go-to pheromones for any occasion. I wear this to work almost daily now, and even purchased a trial of a perfume enhanced with this pheromone blend, so it might be time to spring for another bottle. :)Still one of my favorite go-to pheromones for any occasion.

    <li> The blend is really nice.  It is very versatile.  I recommend this for women in the workplace as it was designed, but it can also be used in social situations.  I got the impression that I came across as very feminine to others, but at the same time very confident and capable. This mix will give you a lot of respect without masculinizing you. Thus it is good for work.  But men still will treat you like a lady and so it is good for social situations.</li>
    <li> I really like the effects of this one, but I can&#x27;t say that I reach for it as much as my other blends. On the bright side, this phero blend seems to really agitate my soon to be ex Monster-in-law, so I do make it a point to where this when I have to deal with her, lmao!</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s what they&#x27;ll say when you wear this one. This is sophisticated lady in a bottle -- a sashaying woman who knows her own mind and worth... and everyone else knows it now, too! She doesn&#x27;t trade on sex appeal, though she is appealing; people take an interest in her because she is simply interesting.  People want to get close and try to learn more about her. It&#x27;s her feminine mystique, you see. She hasn&#x27;t laid out all her cards on the table, and it&#x27;s this that leaves all around her wanting more. They&#x27;ll just have to work for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only trick is getting your ideal amount right so as to get consistent results.</li>
    <li> La Femme Myst&amp;egrave;re gives off that  \\&quot;queen bee\\&quot; effect on everyone around you. It makes you feel happy and carefree and is a blend that gives off great self effects and gives you that air of confidence. I have this in the spray form and find that for me to get the best self effects, I use 4 sprays, one on my torso, neck, and arms.</li>
    <li> I wear this pheromone when I&#x27;m out and about, and it always gives me a boost of energy and confidence. I love how people want to get closer to me too. It&#x27;s like they can tell something is different about me, but they just don&#x27;t know what it is! Love this!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite pheromones. Just a swipe on my torso and a dab split between wrists, and I am good to go. This one makes me feel incredible, euphoric almost, confident and sexy. As for the effects on others, it&#x27;s all eyes on me, men and women. Strangers chat with me as if they know me, and when I go shopping while wearing this, I never have to look for a salesperson. A Love Potion must have!</li>
    <li> I bought this and have tried it numerous times before writing a review. It absolutely does not work. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. However they sent samples of three of their perfumes; A Treasure of Copper, Ghost Bumps and Passionate Whispers. I liked all of them but the Copper is my favorite. Also looking at their site they sell samples of their products so I would try a smaller investment first. And the part about smelling like you don&#x27;t bathe if you wear it in your hair or around your neck is completely true.</li>
    <li> Still loving this product. I have Love Potion&#x27;s &amp;quot;Nola&amp;quot; boosted with this pheromone blend, and it is a perfect pairing. Oh yeah,  &amp;quot;Truth&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Laura&amp;quot; are still liars who never tried any of these products and yet think it is appropriate for them to give 1-star ratings to a hard-working small business owner who just happens to have a devoted fan base of customers.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite pheromones because of the self effects that I get from it. When I wear it, I feel so sexy and in control of every aspect of my life. When I pair it with on of my favorite Love Potion Scents, I feel even more in control. It doesn&#x27;t take much for this Pheromone to work.</li>
    <li> Pheros from Love Potion are amazing! This is the newest add to my collection. It definitely makes me feel more confident when i wear it. i need to test it more to find my sweet spot :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using pheromones for about 4 years now, and this blend is one of the very best!!  I feel so amazing when I wear it, like a goddess!!  I enjoy pheromones as much for the self-effects as for the effect on others, and this one wins on both counts!!  People, men and women alike, are friendly and attentive, and truly attracted to me when I wear this!  I have it unscented and blended at 2x strength with a scent, and I enjoy them both.</li>
