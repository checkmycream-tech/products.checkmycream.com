      <li>I tried this product on a lark and found it to be quite pleasant to use, nicely scented but not overly perfumed, and it worked as advertised.  </li>

      <li>I believe this would have been a very appealing product without the perfume and with a better bottle.  </li>

      <li>All of this sounds great on the surface, but longevity will prove its full benefits.</li>
      <li>The scent is actually attractive and not bad, but this is something your mate will have to approve on you as well.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;During application, I also found the cream to be a bit more like a lotion and actually kind of watery.  </li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant, not feminine, but do know that it is scented (some men may be super picky about this).  </li>
      <li>but the price is high, and I don&#x27;t have a good comparison I can make to know if that&#x27;s a good bargain or not.</li>

      <li>I have tried many types through the years</li>
      <li>the most part, yes it does.</li>
      <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>What you are mostly paying this price for is the caviar extract.</li>
      <li>The best remedy is to daily apply Oil of Olay or Vaseline (but that leaves a greasy residue).</li>
      <li>What you are mostly paying this price for is the caviar extract.</li>
      <li>and it would be better if it was in a pump so that the amount dispensed could be easier to control.  </li>
      <li>Would have preferred a more neutral approach for day to day use rather than making it feel like you sprayed cologne all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>By the end of a week my hands were definitely better but not healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A pump would be better.  </li>
      <li>A pump would be better.  </li>
      <li>This has probably been the best facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve used (and I&#x27;ve tried many).</li>
      <li>fragrance is more like something you would use on your hair, than on your face.  </li>
      <li>I think most people won&#x27;t mind.</li>
      <li>It has a manly light scent which is quite nice</li>
      <li>He also commented on how it felt cool and tingly which he liked.</li>
      <li>However, that being said, the smell is actually pretty good, at the end of the day (or beginning of it)</li>
      <li>we found it to be a good light moisturizer suitable for many skin types, though those with very oily or acne-prone skin should probably use with caution.  </li>
      <li>It gives the perfect finish without looking too shiny or too dry.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite pleasant, however, within an hour, you feel you need more as your skin becomes much dryer to the point of light burning sensation.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a nice light-weight cream that is easily absorbed into the skin.  </li>
      <li>This product has a high price tag; so high, in fact, that it would have be quite impressive to garner even three stars.  </li>
      <li>It applies easily though</li>
      <li>It was light and smooth and smelled lovely.</li>
      <li>It smells like strong</li>
      <li>It is very pleasant knowing it moisturizes without leaving you wet or moist from a lotion.  </li>
      <li>facial cream is great, it fells good going on (non-greasy), smooth and you do not need much of it</li>
      <li>This cream has a great texture, and leaves my face feeling moisturized yet reasonably dry - which I love.  </li>
      <li>* SCENT&lt;br /&gt;There is a light musky scent that will dissipate after awhile.</li>
      <li>a great repairing, smoothing cream which prevents at the same time from skin ageing\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>It went on smooth, and it was creamy and lightweight.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re comfortable spending around $50.00 for a two month supply of moisturizer</li>
      <li>But my primary choice is [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>Felt nice on my skin and has a gentle fragrance.</li>
      <li>The lotion is quite good as far as the feel and absorption into the skin.  </li>
      <li>The scent of this lotion is extremely strong and for me it borders on overwhelming when used on the face since it doesn&#x27;t dissipate very much over time (like say an aftershave would).</li>
      <li>It truly is a unique product in that respect and</li>
      <li>It was worth it!  </li>
      <li>Like most guys I really don&#x27;t care to smell</li>
      <li>Unless you&#x27;re really sensitive to smells, I don&#x27;t think this will be too strong for most guys, but I know that a lot of guys prefer unscented products (myself included), so that might put you off.</li>
      <li>However the price has kept me from ordering more when I can find similar drugstore products at a much better price.</li>
      <li>Its worthy of 3.5 stars.</li>
      <li>When i ordered this I also wondered what I&#x27;d do as I have mild psoriasis on my face that causes redness and flaky skin that I use a preventive ointment on.  </li>
      <li>If you want soft skin that is a pleasure to touch, this stuff is amazing, though and worth the frustration with the tube.</li>
      <li>In conclusion, outstanding product, high price . . .</li>
      <li>I had high hopes, after all it has exotic ingredients.</li>
      <li>was much more like normal.</li>
      <li>But this is most certainly attributed to the perfume again, as applying after shaving makes the lotion too much to apply right away.  </li>
      <li>well worth getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The aroma is a nice light manly scent that is barely noticeable when applied in the amount that is normally applied with a cream like this.  </li>
      <li>Daily application evened his sometimes blotchy complexion and, according to him, combated razor burn nicely.</li>
      <li>but probably worth it.</li>
      <li>The aroma is a nice light manly scent that is barely noticeable when applied in the amount that is normally applied with a cream like this.  </li>
      <li>I am all for a good scent when appropriate, but subtlety is crucial when dealing with facial lotions.  </li>
      <li>It is a rare moment</li>
      <li>Its price reflects these high quality traits (along with the rest of their line), and for the most part, has shown a positive reaction from its users.</li>
      <li>It did not cause any irritation or stinging when my husband used it right after shaving in the morning.  </li>
      <li>It feels like it absorbs right into the skin and pores.</li>
      <li>Neither of those products leaves my face greasy or dry (like many a water-based cream out there), plus they last a good month or two.  </li>
      <li>so I know this is moisturizing but the best thing I like about this is that my face feels smooth and dry and not wet or moist like with a regular over the counter moisturizers.  </li>
      <li>The tube has rather a large opening at the bottom, and the consistency is a little more \\&quot;loose\\&quot; or \\&quot;liquid\\&quot; than some, so it&#x27;s very easy to squirt out too</li>
      <li>It also has a very strong scent, especially when first applied.  </li>
      <li>I find the moisturizing properties of this cream to work well, but it clogs my pores more easily than some other moisturizers.  </li>
      <li>It soaked in quickly and was not irritating.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am a skin care fanatic.  I am always trying out skin care products to see what works and what does not.  My husband has been the unwilling participant of quite a few of my skin care trials.  Eventually, however, when he saw the difference, he began to like using skin care and looks forward to good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AINHOA Men Vitality 24 Hours Cream has been a very unusual experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;Makes skin moisturized and not dry&lt;br /&gt;Gives skin a very unusual velvety feel- nothing has ever made it this soft&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant aroma that is manly but not overly scented&lt;br /&gt;No allergic reactions or irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Tube constant frustration- flies out all over the place&lt;br /&gt;Hard to control application amount&lt;br /&gt;Does not lift or contour face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband gets very frustrated every time he goes to put on the cream as it comes out all over the place and is a waste of money when too much comes out.  The cream is a bit runny too which makes it tougher to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for lift and contour, this product does a little but not much. However, skin condition is beautiful. The skin surface is so velvety- I have never felt anything like this on my husband&#x27;s skin.  It truly is a unique product in that respect and well worth getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One application seems to last 24 hours just as expected which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they could change the container to be easier to use, it would be a great choice for men. As it is now, at the price it is, the tube wastes too much product by coming out erratically.  Since a little goes a long way, it is a shame to waste any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the container problems I have rated this four stars.  If you want soft skin that is a pleasure to touch, this stuff is amazing, though and worth the frustration with the tube.</li>
    <li> This product has a high price tag; so high, in fact, that it would have be quite impressive to garner even three stars.  Well, I can hardly believe it, but this skin cream is unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regard to skin creams for the face, I generally confine myself to Neutrogena ([[ASIN:B000052YOX Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, Sensitive Skin, 4 Ounce]]) and Eucerin ([[ASIN:B001FB5IFA Eucerin Sensitive Facial Skin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Creme, 1.7-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)]]) products.  Neither of those products leaves my face greasy or dry (like many a water-based cream out there), plus they last a good month or two.  I was happy with either of those options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter AINHOA.  I squeezed out a dime-sized diameter of product, applied it to my cheek and spread it over my face.  Oddly, I didn&#x27;t need anywhere near as much AINHOA to moisturize my skin as I would have with Neutrogena or Eucerin.  Whatever its formulation, the AINHOA was absorbed rapidly into my skin, leaving no ostensible residue behind, which is something I can&#x27;t honestly say about my two usual (and favorite) products.  Kind of weird. . . .  My face doesn&#x27;t get as greasy during the workday after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rest assured , a very little of this AINHOA goes a very loooooooong way, so--if I were you--I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily let the 5X cost of this over Neutrogena or Eucerin prevent you from getting it.  In conclusion, outstanding product, high price . . . but probably worth it.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes, after all it has exotic ingredients. In the Winter my hands dry out and the skin cracks open around the knuckles (sometimes bleeding). The best remedy is to daily apply Oil of Olay or Vaseline (but that leaves a greasy residue). I&#x27;ve used Vaseline Intensive- its not as effective but isn&#x27;t greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ainhova is thin with a strong but pleasing masculine scent (like after shave or cologne). It drys in seconds without a residue. I&#x27;ve been applying it at bedtime. The first 3 days I thought I saw slight improvements in the white lines on my hands. The 4th day they were almost gone and my thumb (which at the end was like course sandpaper) was much more like normal. But the improvement stalled at that point. By the end of a week my hands were definitely better but not healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that between 16-18 hours after application, my hands were back to their dried out condition. At the end of using the product for a week I can only conclude that it provides temporary softening and better appearance for the first 12-16 hours. Then it must be re-applied. Ainhova is not a gradual improvement like the Oil of Olay or Vaseline. Its worthy of 3.5 stars.</li>
    <li> First things first:  I am not a man and this product is part of a skin care line geared towards the male population.  I did try this cream a few times myself, but used my husband as the guinea pig for a three week trial.  (Husbands can come in handy sometimes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice light-weight cream that is easily absorbed into the skin.  It did not leave my combination (oily in the t-zone) skin feeling greasy, and provided just the right amount of moisture for my husband&#x27;s normal (neither too oily nor too dry) skin.  It has a rather strong fragrance which is distinctly masculine.  I thought it smelled great, like expensive cologne, but my husband would have preferred a lighter scent or no scent at all.  It did not cause any irritation or stinging when my husband used it right after shaving in the morning.  A small amount (about half the size of a dime) is sufficient for the entire face/neck area.  The manufacturer recommends it be used twice per day, AM/PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per the product insert included inside the package, this cream is \\&quot;...a great repairing, smoothing cream which prevents at the same time from skin ageing\\&quot;.  That&#x27;s fairly vague, though I guess you could quibble about the \\&quot;age prevention\\&quot; statement.  I/we found it to be a good light moisturizer suitable for many skin types, though those with very oily or acne-prone skin should probably use with caution.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s rich enough to provide sufficient moisture for very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*does not contain sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;*should last 30-60 days (you don&#x27;t need to use a lot)&lt;br /&gt;*not for those who prefer unscented products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end it comes down to your budget.  The quality is good, but it is not inexpensive.  If you&#x27;re comfortable spending around $50.00 for a two month supply of moisturizer then I say \\&quot;go for it\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> The AINHOA Men Vitality 24 hours Cream comes in an ample amount (1.7 fluid ounces), but packing a quality cream for Men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream leaves my skin feeling smooth, soft, and refreshed. It&#x27;s thick when you squeeze about a dime-sized amount out, but it goes on the face very light. It feels like it absorbs right into the skin and pores. I&#x27;m in my mid 20s with good, clear skin, and this cream just makes my face glow and look even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I can really point that&#x27;s not perfect is the smell. I think most people won&#x27;t mind. The scent a bit strong, but I actually like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a premium price for a premium product. Try it once and see if you like it. It makes good skin great.</li>
    <li> For some the price might not be an issued.  . but. . . for me, it&#x27;s way too expensive to purchase on a regular basis.  Having said that, I like it well enough.  It does a \\&quot;reasonable\\&quot; job, though not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is more like something you would use on your hair, than on your face.  I don&#x27;t mind it, but I still find it \\&quot;odd\\&quot; for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though they call this a \\&quot;cream\\&quot;, it&#x27;s really not \\&quot;creamy\\&quot; at all.  It&#x27;s kind of a translucent brown.  It applies easily though and it doesn&#x27;t take much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was in a different \\&quot;container\\&quot;.  The tube has rather a large opening at the bottom, and the consistency is a little more \\&quot;loose\\&quot; or \\&quot;liquid\\&quot; than some, so it&#x27;s very easy to squirt out too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s \\&quot;ok\\&quot; but not great. . . especially for this price.</li>
    <li> This has probably been the best facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve used (and I&#x27;ve tried many). It not only has a great smell, but it actually leaves my skin feeling hydrated and much smoother to the touch. These effects are lasting--and a little of this moisturizer goes a long way, making it a decent value for its somewhat premium price.</li>
    <li> I have never really used expensive skin care products, most of the times it would be some type of regular body lotion or face cream and those served their purpose....even though i was always on the look for a non-greasy cream that wouldn&#x27;t be shiny on my skin and would last all day long...well it looks like i found it.&lt;br /&gt;This facial cream is great, it fells good going on (non-greasy), smooth and you do not need much of it and it goes a long way. The only complaint i have is in the smell of the cream, is that of a strong male cologne..and i already have a cologne and down really need anymore. However, that being said, the smell is actually pretty good, at the end of the day (or beginning of it) what matters is that my skin looks great, feels great and stays like that all day long. A little pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, the price does give me pause - I&#x27;m reviewing a free product, and can&#x27;t imagine taking a $50 risk to buy this myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, first impressions are good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend likes the scent - always a plus! She specifically says it&#x27;s a \\&quot;man&#x27;s scent\\&quot; as opposed to the &#x27;frat boy&#x27; scent of other body products. To me, it has a cologne smell that I liked, and in small doses it is subtle and not at all overpowering or alcohol-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In small applications, there is no greasy feel on the face or hands. It goes on smoothly, and the initial moisturizing feels pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a couple dry spots on my face that I got this product specifically to try out on, but that&#x27;s a longterm process before I could offer any judgement. At least the life of the tube, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s a good product that I think I&#x27;ll find a use for, at least for the life of this tube - but the price is high, and I don&#x27;t have a good comparison I can make to know if that&#x27;s a good bargain or not. Further research into the benefits of the specific ingredients would be a good idea before making this a regular purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I do notice any improvement with the dry spots then that I will update this accordingly.</li>
    <li> Nice cream. Ainhoa is deeply moisturizing, but it is not so thick that you feel like you are wearing a mask.  It&#x27;s not oily, so no worries about too much shine.  The effects from putting it on overnight last throughout the day.  The smell is pleasant, not feminine, but do know that it is scented (some men may be super picky about this).  Also to note: while it does not state it is for sensitive skin, the sensitive-skinned gentleman who tried this had no problems.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  It gives the perfect finish without looking too shiny or too dry.  The texture is more a gel than a cream or lotion and feels great when you put it on your skin.  The smell is neutral and not overpowering at all. However the price has kept me from ordering more when I can find similar drugstore products at a much better price.</li>
    <li> Hubby really like this product.  It went on smooth, and it was creamy and lightweight.  Didn&#x27;t feel like a lotion had been applied.  He said it lasted through the whole day. Imporvement has been seen in the texture of his skin.  Works nice.</li>
    <li> This cream has a great texture, and leaves my face feeling moisturized yet reasonably dry - which I love.  However, it is priced at the highest end of premium, and there are a number of moisturizers that cost 30-50% less that deliver for me just as well.</li>
    <li> This is a super-luxe feeling moisturizer with a great scent. I can&#x27;t speak to long-term effects because it&#x27;s so hard to get a guy to use moisturizer daily, but it feels amazing.</li>
    <li> I am a man that uses moisturizers daily ever since I started shaving.  I have tried many types through the years but my staples are narrowed to two.  In a drugstore situation, I opt for [[ASIN:B000052YOX Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, Sensitive Skin, 4 Ounce]] as it works well, no fragrance and relatively affordable. But my primary choice is [[ASIN:B000O6050U Kiehl&#x27;s Ultra Facial Moisturizer (All Skin Types) - 250ml/8.4oz]] which is also fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is rare to have fragrance in male skin products, and this one is extremely heavy in scent.  In fact, in the plethora of ingredients listed (which you need a microscope to read on the box), \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; is not far from the top, which means there is much more perfume than actual product.  Occasionally I can tolerate a fragrance, but it&#x27;s very rare.  Other than a limited amount of colognes I can wear, I opt for fragrance free products that go on my body so they do not conflict the scent.  If you were to use this product, you could only wear this as it&#x27;s that strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With fragrance there is also alcohol, and alcohol is alcohol, so it is drying. A strong contradiction to the initial application of the product.  The lotion is quite good as far as the feel and absorption into the skin.  It&#x27;s quite pleasant, however, within an hour, you feel you need more as your skin becomes much dryer to the point of light burning sensation.  But this is most certainly attributed to the perfume again, as applying after shaving makes the lotion too much to apply right away.  So, in other words, this is by far a nigh creme.  After a night shower, ready for bed, or bed activity, is the best time.  The scent is actually attractive and not bad, but this is something your mate will have to approve on you as well.  If they do not like the scent then you are pretty limited as to when you could use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a mere 1.7oz, it needs to be in a small pump, especially for this price.  But, no, it&#x27;s in a standard plastic tube that delivers too much product at once if you are not careful. The price point makes the tube inexcusable.  And the ingredient list is much longer than what is on this page.  What you are mostly paying this price for is the caviar extract. I believe this would have been a very appealing product without the perfume and with a better bottle.  No matter what, I highly suggest finding a way to sample it first.tube that delivers too much product at once if you are not careful. The price point makes the tube inexcusable.

    <li> I have combination oily/normal skin that gets really dry in the winter and sometimes I get excessive dryness from acne products, so I was intrigued by AINHOA MEN&#x27;S VITALITY 24-HOUR CREAM that came across my Vine offerings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work well with my skin type because it still felt dry and tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the good points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* SCENT&lt;br /&gt;There is a light musky scent that will dissipate after awhile. Unless you&#x27;re really sensitive to smells, I don&#x27;t think this will be too strong for most guys, but I know that a lot of guys prefer unscented products (myself included), so that might put you off. It doesn&#x27;t smell flowery or feminine and actually reminds me of those old fashioned after shave products that older gentlemen used to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* MATTE FINISH&lt;br /&gt;This was really nice in that it gave my skin a matte finish. It almost looked and felt like a makeup primer (makeup primers are products that some people use prior to putting on either liquid or powder foundation which \\&quot;primes\\&quot; the skin and helps the makeup blend and stay on better) in that it made my skin look totally shine-free and smooth. That was a big plus since I know a lot of us guys have oily skin and sometimes just using a regular moisturizer makes it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the drawbacks of the AINHOA MEN&#x27;S VITALITY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* NOT GOOD FOR DRY SKIN&lt;br /&gt;Although the AINHOA went on smoothly and absorbed quickly, my skin still felt dry and tight. It only felt moisturized immediately after I put it on and then it went back to being dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* NO SPF&lt;br /&gt;This product has no sunscreen in it, so you&#x27;ll still have to wear one if you plan on being outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, AINHOA MEN&#x27;S VITALITY 24 HOUR CREAM (the texture is more lotion than thick cream) is probably best for guys who have excessively oily skin. Those with drier skin types and who need sunscreen I suggest [[ASIN:B0028K3J7Q Olay Regenerist Regenerating Lotion With Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Spf 50 1.7 Fl Oz]].m Spf 50 1.7 Fl Oz]].</li>
    <li> In my never-ending search for the perfect moisturizer, I was eager to try this one.  My skin is quite dry, partly due to low humidity.  I find the moisturizing properties of this cream to work well, but it clogs my pores more easily than some other moisturizers.  It also has a very strong scent, especially when first applied.  It smells like strong cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of the tube either.  You will not be able to get every drop out of it, which stinks for this price point.  This product would have been much better if it was in a small tub-like container so you can use ALL of it.  And be careful when you open the tube for the first time.  Mine was under pressure, so when I first opened it, a lot squirted out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will continue to use this cream after I finish this tube.</li>
    <li> This product has a masculine scent, and left my skin feeling hydrated and smooth. But no more smooth or hydrated than a $10 dollar after shave. At least in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the money and you wish to splurge for a high end face cream, I have no cons to give. But for someone who is on a budget, there is frankly no reason I can think if as to why you should buy this product over the cream at your local drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not wish to take away from the product at all. Just the price tag. Unless this cream could perform miracles, I will stick to buying my $10 cream once the bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream.  My husband is one of those guy who normally just shaves and washes his face with regular soap, so this was a serious change in routine for him.  It was worth it!  His skin feels softer and looks healthier than ever.  No lotions that he has ever tried gave this effect.  There is no greasy film or shine.  He only uses a small amount and it is just right.  I found the fragrance to be light and not very noticeable unless I was literally in his face.  He wasn&#x27;t bothered by the scent and it doesn&#x27;t linger.  It didn&#x27;t compete with his cologne either.  My only complaints are that it is, a bit thin and it would be better if it was in a pump so that the amount dispensed could be easier to control.  For this price I believe that adjustments are warranted.  Over all it is a good product.</li>
    <li> I wondered what kind of nut would buy this expensive cream and figured I&#x27;d really end up panning this cream if I tried it, but curiosity got to me, so I said WTF and ordered it to gave it a go and see if it was what it is cracked up to be.  Man was I wrong in assuming this was a rip off deal.  When i ordered this I also wondered what I&#x27;d do as I have mild psoriasis on my face that causes redness and flaky skin that I use a preventive ointment on.  I decided to stop using the cream for the psoriasis a week before this came.  Once this cream arrived I started using this [sparingly] as the price alone should be a shout out that this is not Jergens.  I apply about a ball shaped dime sized dose in total all over my face, once in the morning and once in the evening, when applied I notice a very slight tingling around my eyelids and the bags under my eyes like, for about an hour (nothing irritating - more like a cool tingle), so it seems that is doing something to the fatty or saggy areas there every time I apply the cream.  I don&#x27;t feel anything anywhere else on my face like I do around my eyes.  The tingling seems to last about an hour.  After about 2.5 weeks of using this I checked pictures taken when I started using this and the bags under the eyes seem a tad less noticeable and the skin seems tighter.  This was verified visually from someone that saw me before I started using this cream twice daily and saw me again just before i wrote this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this is moisturizing my skin because without the psoriasis cream my inner cheek areas flake lightly.  Since using this there has been absolutely no flaking so I know this is moisturizing but the best thing I like about this is that my face feels smooth and dry and not wet or moist like with a regular over the counter moisturizers.  It is very pleasant knowing it moisturizes without leaving you wet or moist from a lotion.  If I can swing it I am determined to buy at least one more after this tube runs out and if this works out well or not I&#x27;m updating this review in another 2 to 3 weeks to at least finish the tube for a full review of a complete tube.  It will all depend on how long the Vitality cream lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who is griping about the smell has to be using an awful lot and that is not the intent with this cream. (Obviously from the price.)  The aroma is a nice light manly scent that is barely noticeable when applied in the amount that is normally applied with a cream like this.  If you have the money and are willing to try this I don&#x27;t think you will regret the purchase especially if you are used to purchasing products like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rating I&#x27;m giving is due to the fact that the delivery system for this VERY EXPENSIVE cream needs to be better made to dispense small droplets rather than the occasional large goop popping out because an air bubble, heavy finger, or accidental hard squeeze.  This is way too expensive for a crappy delivery system.  A pump would be better.  Too much can be wasted by an accidental squeeze or bubble in the tube.  So far I&#x27;m giving this a 4 star rating even with the expensive price but mainly because people need to be able to dispense this easier and with a set drop size.  I am impressed with this cream&#x27;s effect on me to date.  Further updates on effect on skin are to come as I use up the tube.  I&#x27;LL BE BACK!d if this works out well or not I&#x27;m updating this review in another 2 to 3 weeks to at least finish the tube for a full review of a complete tube.

    <li> This is not a complex product requiring a lot of explanation... it is simply a good moisturizer..... but loses a star for value due to the high cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice cream, it goes on smoothly, soaks in without feeling slick on the skin, and legitimately makes the skin *feel* good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is nice and subtle, a touch floral, but not perfumey.  People won&#x27;t likely notice it unless you direct them to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost is prohibitive, however.  You can probably get a cream you like almost as much at a supermarket or drug store, for $10 or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If price were no object, I would buy and use this product.  It&#x27;s quality makes me wish I could afford to.  Some will, but I do wonder how big the high-end men&#x27;s moisturizer market is.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my husband to try and got the yeah right tough guy response, what real men use moisture on their face! Well I noticed the difference in a few days and was actually surprised he was actually using it at all ha ha but I didn&#x27;t say a word. He finally said something two weeks later commenting on how his wrinkles were less noticeable and his skin felt really soft. \\&quot;Did he actually say that\\&quot; was my first thought. My husband works in the hot sun of Florida every day and his skin is very wrinkled and leathery, this product actually did make his skin much smoother and softer, both he and I really could see and feel a difference. It has a manly light scent which is quite nice and I am not a big fan of scents. He also commented on how it felt cool and tingly which he liked. So there you go, if a guy like mine likes this any guy out there probably will. I would highly recommend this to any guy that wants to take care of his skin.</li>
    <li> I found AINHOA a pleasurable aftershave experience. Felt nice on my skin and has a gentle fragrance. I dont shave everyday, but when I do, I usually use some sort of aftershave, or cream to soften the skin. AINHOA has stated it uses the highest quality ingredients, such as plant and caviar extract, vitamins, and marine DNA to promote cell growth. All of this sounds great on the surface, but longevity will prove its full benefits. Its price reflects these high quality traits (along with the rest of their line), and for the most part, has shown a positive reaction from its users. It is a rare moment (if ever there was one) where I am verbally recommending men&#x27;s facial aftershave cream and I do not know that I will have that opportunity. But for those who have reached this page and are considering this item, if the price is within your budget, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> A great hydrating cream. Excellent fragrance. Absorbs well. For the face but I also used it on my dry hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contains: Antioxidants vitamins C &amp; E, vitamin A, glycospheres, caviar and green tea extracts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High quality skin product.</li>
    <li> At age 59 I can use all the help I can get in the age lines.  Keeping a younger look is important when it comes to getting a promotion.  A bit of maturity can sometimes be advantageous but too much can hurt your chances.  My wife has been on to me for years and she goes ballistic when she sees me using regular bar soap on my face.  So I finally thought I would give this a try.  I have been applying this product for about a month now and I would first like to thank the makers for making it relatively odorless.  Like most guys I really don&#x27;t care to smell like I just walked out of a beauty shop.  It&#x27;s really hard to tell if its my imagination or that my &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; are not as pronounced as they were before I started this treatment.  My wife swears that she can see a difference but I guess I am just more skeptical.  While I do think I see some improvement I can&#x27;t really say whether or not it would be any different if I had been using pretty much any other less expensive product.  After all, as my wife says, applying any moisturizer to you face on a regular basis will make the skin look healthier and younger.  I have been using it to target specific areas and so I will have a good bit remaining.  I plan to continue using it until its gone and will update you when done, but so far I just have not seen enough improvement to justify the price.</li>
    <li> One of my male friends makes no secret of his affinity for expensive skin care products, so he jumped at the chance to try this item. The verdict: the pros outweigh the cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the advertising, MEN Vitality 24 Hours Cream is formulated to combat the skin care issues particular to men. Caviar extract, select vitamins and minerals, and marine DNA nourish the skin, combat the effects of aging, and encourage cell regeneration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But does it work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part, yes it does. My friend reported that this creamy moisturizer softened his skin without leaving behind an oily residue. Daily application evened his sometimes blotchy complexion and, according to him, combated razor burn nicely. His only complaint was that the scent was more concentrated than what he is used to in a skin cream, forcing him to use smaller amounts and possibly diluting its benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a beneficial addition to a man&#x27;s skin care regimen if the hefty price tag doesn&#x27;t deter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that I&#x27;m a skeptic when it comes to these expensive skin cremes that are supposed to make you look younger, healthier, and so on.  I tried this product on a lark and found it to be quite pleasant to use, nicely scented but not overly perfumed, and it worked as advertised.  Yes, your skin is moisturized and feels softer after a few days of use.  Not exactly ground breaking though, as I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena and Nivea products that are a tenth of the price and give me the same results. Is this a good product? Yes. Is it worth the high price tag? I just don&#x27;t see a difference between the results.  for my money, I still prefer using [[ASIN:B000KFX23M Nivea Creme, 6.8 Oz (192 G), (Pack Of 3)]]. The Nivea is actually less oily and absorbs into the skin quicker.</li>
    <li> Count me in among the other reviewers who found the fragrance of this cream too much to bear.  I am all for a good scent when appropriate, but subtlety is crucial when dealing with facial lotions.  After applying this to my face I felt like I&#x27;d taken a bath in perfume.  It actually threw off my sense of smell, and was thoroughly unpleasant.  I think that&#x27;s why I generally like Nivea mens facial care products; if they do have any scent, it is so light that it is not offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin did seem softer and less shiny after use, or so my wife commented, so it has that going for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During application, I also found the cream to be a bit more like a lotion and actually kind of watery.  At this price point I was expecting something superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I&#x27;d give this a &#x27;meh&#x27; rating.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on accident, intending to receive the AINHOA caviar face cream. So when this came, I figured that I was just try it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I used it once. It was light and smooth and smelled lovely. It soaked in quickly and was not irritating. Then my husband stole it, hid it and finished the tube. And he was so impressed (me too). My husband is not a fancy face cream guy. He uses what ever I set on the counter. He has a high stress job and then we also have a small farm that we live on and a large ranch about 1/2 hour away. He has lots of stress, little rest, and he is out in the elements. But this cream really did make a noticeable difference. It didn&#x27;t make him look younger. It just made him look like the best version of him. He looked fresher and well rested. I could tell when the tube ran out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint is the dispenser hole in the tube is just too big. When I used it I got way too much and he had the same problem. I finally gave my husband an empty face cream jar to put it in so he could conserve it. If something actually works you don&#x27;t want to waste it.</li>
    <li> The scent of this lotion is extremely strong and for me it borders on overwhelming when used on the face since it doesn&#x27;t dissipate very much over time (like say an aftershave would). Would have preferred a more neutral approach for day to day use rather than making it feel like you sprayed cologne all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very doubtful that the exotic ingredients have any meaningful health benefits, but the lotion preforms as well as any others, although at this stage there was nothing that made it feel superior to what you would get from non-luxury brand. Did seem to leave a bit of a greasy residue and didn&#x27;t blend into the skin as much as I would have hoped.</li>
</ol>
