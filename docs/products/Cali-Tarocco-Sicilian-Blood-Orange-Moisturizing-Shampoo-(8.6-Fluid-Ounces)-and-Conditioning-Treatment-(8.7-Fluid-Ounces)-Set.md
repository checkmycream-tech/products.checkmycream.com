      <li>I enjoy the scent when I wash my hair.</li>
      <li>I found this originally at my hotel room in Las Vegas</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t clean my hair</li>

      <li>/&gt;Received this product quickly.</li>

      <li>It has a lovely smell and leaves our hair clean and soft......  </li>
      <li>Love the scent &amp; the way it makes my hair feel soft &amp; bouncy!</li>
      <li>, it leaves your hair soft and clean too!</li>
      <li>I have this a 2 star because for the price I expected better quality shampoo!</li>
      <li>The first time I came across Tarocco products was when I stayed at a hotel in northern Maine.  </li>
      <li>Me and my family really like this product!</li>
      <li>I would prefer that it did not have sulfates, but that would most likely require a price hike.</li>
      <li>First used this at a hotel in San Diego.  </li>
      <li>Found it first in a hotel chain and went looking on the internet.</li>
      <li>I really like this shampoo!</li>
      <li>I first tried these from a hotel that I stayed at and like the product.</li>
      <li>Some leaked in shipping and some more in the shower because it didn&#x27;t close properly.</li>
      <li>I noticed when I first received the package, the bottle was all sticky when I removed it from the plastic wrap.</li>
      <li>still... waste of good shampoo...)</li>
      <li>I used the shampoo and conditioner for the first time while staying at an upscale hotel in San Antonio and really enjoyed the fact that it left my hair soft, smooth and very shiny.</li>
      <li>but I really like the way it makes my hair smell and fee</li>
      <li>The con is that in the wintertime your hair stands straight up in the air.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I really like this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>Thanks for asking.</li>
      <li>It really soaks into the hair &amp; leaves hair silky and manageable with a citrus scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;But the design of the lid really needs improving</li>
      <li>so I am willing to pay a little more for this product.</li>
      <li>The oranges smell fresh and clean, but subtle enough that you can&#x27;t smell it every time you turn your head.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that when I returned home and to my regular routine of being indoors, I noticed that it made my hair be full of static.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve ever used that works, without being heavy or getting greasy quick, as most conditioners do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>They leave my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>My hair has natural waves, but with all the various products out there, I very seldom see them.  </li>
      <li>but my hairdresser says it has too much citrus for my blonde hair and affects the color.</li>
      <li>but........super cheap containers, probably wasted like 25% leaking out of the tops.....</li>
      <li>/&gt;Really yummy orange smell and leaves my hair soft and shiny.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product makes my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>Tried this product in a hotel and shampoo was thick and luxurious - not so much in the full sized bottle.</li>
      <li>As far as the Conditioning Treatment, just use a little and rinse right off.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately,  they are hard to locate in stores, and we seldom have an opportunity to return to northern Maine, so I was quite pleased to find the shampoo and conditioner available  through Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>During the course of my three night stay my hair became incredibly soft and stayed so long after I got home.</li>

<li> may try it again in the spring/summer to see if it does better, but for now it&#x27;s impossible to continue.</li>
<li> The pro is that with low moisture, you get less frizz.</li>
<li> The conditioner is not a gooey mess like the last one I had used.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s what I expected, ordered it because, I had used samples that was in a place we stayed.</li>
<li> I usually don&#x27;t buy &#x27;personal products&#x27; on Amazon.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Like the way my hair responds to this shampoo</li>
    <li> The first time I came across Tarocco products was when I stayed at a hotel in northern Maine.  My hair really looked and felt nice after using the Tarocco sample products available in our room.  Unfortunately,  they are hard to locate in stores, and we seldom have an opportunity to return to northern Maine, so I was quite pleased to find the shampoo and conditioner available  through Amazon.com.  They have a very light orange scent, and my hair is quite manageable after washing and blow drying.  I would definitely purchase these again.</li>
    <li> I love this product but I wish the conditioner was a little thicker and I wish the price was a tad cheaper.</li>
    <li> Works well for my hair. Nourishing. Does conditioner come in a larger size. Will definitely reorder these products. Thanks for asking.</li>
    <li> Very nice blood orange scent.  I enjoy the scent when I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo and conditioner. I had a sample from a spa in Nevada and searched to find the product on line. The shampoo is really nice and moisturizing within being heavy, I have thin hair and the conditioner does not seem to weigh it down, but I use it sparingly.</li>
    <li> Love the product and ordered it twice, but.both times the bottles end up cracking and leaking out. .. wasting alot of product down the drain.  Will not order it a 3rd time...</li>
    <li> I purchased this because ,like others I had a sample from  a hotel. They seem to lack the same quality as the smaller samples. The shampoo and condition set was especially a disappointment. They stripped my  hair of its coloring like a cheap dollar store shampo might do. The soaps and oil also lost their fragrance quickly.  It  was quite a waste of money. I will not repeat this mistake again.</li>
    <li> Shampoo was oozing out of its container (it was wrapped in packaging tape) and seemed watered down.  Tried this product in a hotel and shampoo was thick and luxurious - not so much in the full sized bottle. Wouldn&#x27;t order again from this seller, but might try from somewhere else because it smells SO good!</li>
    <li> I love the feeling clean after using the shampoo.  The conditioner is not a gooey mess like the last one I had used.  My hair is manageable and looks shiney after I have shampooed.  I do not experience the itching that has been part of using every other shampoo I&#x27;ve used in the last couple of years.  Tho I dislike shopping online, I will continue doing so to continue using these products.</li>
    <li> Tarocco shampoo and conditioner smell wonderful.  This product makes my hair soft and shiny.  It is a bit pricy but I really like the way it makes my hair smell and fee so I am willing to pay a little more for this product.</li>
    <li> Found it at a spa and loved it.  Great price.  Delivered on time and love using it.  Unique aroma and great for your hair</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have used for a long time.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I just wish the bottles were bigger!!  I discovered it in a hotel in Vegas and have been using it since!</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy &#x27;personal products&#x27; on Amazon. I found this originally at my hotel room in Las Vegas and I loved the product so much that I have been ordering it ever since. Very nice shampoo, but the conditioner is my favorite. It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve ever used that works, without being heavy or getting greasy quick, as most conditioners do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> Choose this rating as I do like it a lot. It&#x27;s what I expected, ordered it because, I had used samples that was in a place we stayed.</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo and conditioner. Maybe the best I&#x27;ve ever used. They smell amazing! The reason I took off a star is because the lids tend to leak. I noticed when I first received the package, the bottle was all sticky when I removed it from the plastic wrap. It had leaked. I took this with me while traveling and the shampoo leaked all over. (Lucky I kept it sealed inside of a ziplock bag.. still... waste of good shampoo...) So if you&#x27;re just keeping it on a shelf and always upright, you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the design of the lid really needs improving</li>
    <li> My hair has natural waves, but with all the various products out there, I very seldom see them.  Enter Tarocco Shampoo - what a difference!  I would recommend this to anyone.  As far as the Conditioning Treatment, just use a little and rinse right off.</li>
    <li> Me and my family really like this product! We used it at a Hotel we stayed at on the Oregon Coast.</li>
    <li> Love the smell but my hairdresser says it has too much citrus for my blonde hair and affects the color.</li>
    <li> it is nothing like shampoo that i got from a hotel in Montana,the smell is gone within a few minutes, i am very disapointed.would never buy it again.</li>
    <li> We love ALL the Cali products!</li>
    <li> Great stuff!!! Ran into it in a hotel in Portland and really liked the aromatherapy aspect. Give it a whirl!!</li>
    <li> I first tried these from a hotel that I stayed at and like the product. Still working well for my hair.</li>
    <li> Love the scent &amp; the way it makes my hair feel soft &amp; bouncy!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. I have been looking for it since March, when I used it at Hotel Contessa in San Antonio.</li>
    <li> Great stuff but........super cheap containers, probably wasted like 25% leaking out of the tops.....</li>
    <li> Smells great but bottle needs to be redesigned. Some leaked in shipping and some more in the shower because it didn&#x27;t close properly. I love how it smells but I will look for something else locally. I don&#x27;t like the bottle at all.</li>
    <li> I like the product, it shipped and arrived quickly. I like the smell of orange on my hair and like the way the product makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product several times.  It lasts for a long time and my hair loves it too!  I would recommend buying the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Got a sample of the conditioner and loved it.  So I decided to try the shampoo also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really yummy orange smell and leaves my hair soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received this product quickly.</li>
    <li> I used the shampoo and conditioner for the first time while staying at an upscale hotel in San Antonio and really enjoyed the fact that it left my hair soft, smooth and very shiny. I am not terribly fond of fruit scented shampoos, but this one is not overpowering. The oranges smell fresh and clean, but subtle enough that you can&#x27;t smell it every time you turn your head.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that when I returned home and to my regular routine of being indoors, I noticed that it made my hair be full of static. Granted this was in the winter, but my hair was flying everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;Static builds up in hair when it has very low moisture. This situation has pros and cons. The pro is that with low moisture, you get less frizz. The con is that in the wintertime your hair stands straight up in the air.&lt;br /&gt;I may try it again in the spring/summer to see if it does better, but for now it&#x27;s impossible to continue.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner. They leave my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Smells great and I had used it when I stayed at a Hotel chain. It was expensive and purchased through Amazon for $30.00, but after two uses I developed a severe scalp allergy to this product, consisting of severe itching and boils. The company refused to refund, exchange or credit the purchase in any way.</li>
    <li> Purchased shampoo &amp; conditioner.... love this product. It really soaks into the hair &amp; leaves hair silky and manageable with a citrus scent.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, Love the fragrance!</li>
    <li> i love this shampoo and conditioner.  A motel in San Diego uses it.  My hair is softer and more manageable with it.  The bottles came together in bubble wrap and the tops were taped down so the bottles didn&#x27;t open and leak out the shampoo or conditioner</li>
    <li> First used this at a hotel in San Diego.  Liked it so much I bought it when I got home</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my g.f.... It is the featured shampoo at our favorite hotel in San Diego.....  It has a lovely smell and leaves our hair clean and soft......  I only wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, I&#x27;d buy it more often</li>
    <li> I have this a 2 star because for the price I expected better quality shampoo! It feels like you are washing your hair with a cheap dollar store brand! Didn&#x27;t clean my hair still felt dirty after words !&lt;br /&gt;I do say I loved the smell tho</li>
    <li> I tried it at a hotel and my hair was soft straight and felt good therefore I had to continue using it.  I reallylove this product.</li>
    <li> I take this stuff to the gym. The first week the shampoo leaked all over my gym bag and emptied half of the bottle, not to say what a mess it made. The next week the conditioner slipped out of my hand and fell . The bottle snapped in half and again half of it was gone. I would never buy this product again due to it poor packaging.</li>
    <li> I found these products in a hotel and immediately order them, it was love at first sight, love the way it leaves my hair.</li>
    <li> I discovered these while traveling. My hotel stocked them. During the course of my three night stay my hair became incredibly soft and stayed so long after I got home.</li>
    <li> The products are excellent, they made my very fine hair seem thicker and much more manageable. I am very pleased with the results</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo! Found it first in a hotel chain and went looking on the internet. I love the blood orange fragrance and my hair, which tends toward dryness, stays shiny and sleek with this product. Will I buy it again? Probably so. I would prefer that it did not have sulfates, but that would most likely require a price hike.</li>
    <li> i tried this product quite by accident, when this was the sample sizes left in my hotel room. not only does this product smell great, it leaves your hair soft and clean too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about three years and I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.  A barber suggested it and my hair has much more body and is more manageable.</li>
