### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Also, I think it might be best used to try to regain balance rather than intentionally help bear 250 lbs of weight.  </li>
      <li>this is a wonderful product</li>
      <li>homeowners are very happy with this product.  </li>
      <li>to many words to have to write!~!!!!</li>
      <li>After spinal surgery this is a great product for peace of mind</li>
      <li>I ordered this product after my wife damaged her knee and experienced problems getting into and out of the shower.  </li>
      <li>This looks good and works great for that purpose.  </li>
      <li>Good workmanship, handles stick to shower wall</li>
      <li>Good suction, stable.  </li>
      <li>Certainly better than nothing!</li>
      <li>It gives her great support in the shower, and is incredibly easy to install.</li>
      <li>when you firt start standing on your own in the shower.  </li>
      <li>I read reviews from people who said they needed to replace the hold each time it was intended to be used, and I was okay with that.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
      <li>I guess if you get it to stick and test it before each shower, you might be okay</li>
      <li>safe</li>
      <li>Glad</li>
      <li>and I feel safe.</li>
      <li>We have 4-inch tiles in our bathroom, like most houses in the US.</li>
      <li>A FAIR TRIAL ON A SUPER CLEAN TILE WALL.</li>
      <li>made him feel very secure and comfortable getting in and out of the shower.</li>
      <li>Five stars easily.</li>
      <li>It is easily put on and easy to remove when needed elsewhere.</li>
      <li>easy to attach... works as advertized...</li>
      <li>However,  I still kept my shower bench with handles available in case</li>
      <li>Will not attach securely to any of the tiled or fiberglass surfaces I have tried</li>
      <li>DO NOT USE UNLESS YPOU HAVE A PRIMARY PERM ATTACHED SAFETY BAR.</li>
      <li>If the surface has any deviation at all from smooth, the grip does not sustain the hold.</li>
      <li>Made well and securely holds on smooth shower surface.</li>
      <li>The bar would not stick to the fiberglass shower surround or the smooth, painted wall.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Remove it, clean the wall and reinstall it once a week for peace of mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this as a temporary handhold device for about 3 months after surgery and never had a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The first time it was used, it seemed to work fine</li>
      <li>The first couple weeks, they stuck fine...</li>
      <li>My mother was coming to visit, and I needed a safety solution for the bathroom, and I needed it quickly.  </li>
      <li>It will work on some other surfaces, but will not work on the most popular tile size.    </li>
      <li>It does not weigh much, can be inserted in the side of a suitcase taking up very little space, and was wonderful to have.  </li>
      <li>This product holds securely to the shower wall, and while you are not supposed to put your whole weight on it, I am no longer nervous holding on to it to help support me when I lower myself on to my shower stool.</li>
      <li>priced right... was not made in America...</li>
      <li>If you can get a metal grab-bar actually screwed into a stud, that would be much better.  </li>
      <li>That said, it functioned exactly as we had hoped, and we would highly recommend it for someone willing to use it as directed.</li>
      <li>but my problem also lies in the fact my tiles are more the 4x4 size and it is difficult to find two that are perfectly aligned to let the suction cups stick to the center of the tile, which is ABSOLUTELY necessary to be secure.</li>
      <li>very helpful after my husband had his surgery this pass year.</li>
      <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;Bought</li>
      <li>but for me, I found it was much safer just to buy a shower bench and let them sit on that before I help them out.</li>
      <li>We will be sure to use it again in the near future.</li>
      <li>They really help to steady her whether she&#x27;s showering or in the tub.  </li>
      <li>~ this bar is not designed to hold your full weight, only to help you stay balanced.</li>
      <li>does not need instulation like so many standard grab bars require simple to install this haS</li>
      <li>BUT WHEN I GO TO USE IT TO HELP STEADY</li>
      <li>Big enough to easily grab if needed.</li>
      <li>They are only as strong as the suction they can create -- which is very darn little.  </li>
      <li>It clearly states this bar is for Leverage, Not Pounce All Your Weight</li>
      <li>Bought this for my 90 year old father in law who visits his daughters.  </li>
      <li>but I was upset to find the same product on amazon a couple of weeks later at a very much reduced price.</li>

<li> it for extra stability...and just having anything but a flat wall will help you to keep your balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> Do not depend on this to support your whole weight,  will fail off the wall and cause you to fall.</li>
<li> It turned out that all our tile has a slightly bumpy pattern, and the suction won&#x27;t stick.</li>
<li> The consumer never wins!</li>
<li> have a member of the family that is disabled and I would recommend this product for the safety factor it proivides for the person using the devise and the peace of mind</li>
<li> Suction cups do not adhere to tile that is not totally smooth.</li>
<li> /&gt;I installed a metal unit for my Mother using long screws into the studs behind the tile...</li>
<li> /&gt;Pulling on it straight, it&#x27;s almost impossible to remove it without removing tile also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> FALLEN AND MAY HAE HAD A SERIOUS INJURY..</li>
<li> only bad thing about it....</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a scary feeling knowing that your don&#x27;t have anything to grab onto while your in the shower if you start to fall or slip.  </li>
<li> and I was afraid I would slip or fall in the tub while taking a shower.</li>
<li> Too dangerous.</li>
<li> I was afraid they would pull off the wall.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I needed a grab bar for my shower prior to spinal surgery.  This product holds securely to the shower wall, and while you are not supposed to put your whole weight on it, I am no longer nervous holding on to it to help support me when I lower myself on to my shower stool. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I have three installed in a fiber glass tub.  They offer balance support, but would not support your weight in a fall.  But, what would?  Certainly better than nothing!</li>
    <li> This product works well but I was upset to find the same product on amazon a couple of weeks later at a very much reduced price. The consumer never wins! It is easily put on and easy to remove when needed elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I like the grab bar I received for Christmas 2010.  I do test it before using it, as suggested, and it is a help in getting out of my tub after a shower.  I have since bought a smaller grab bar for travels.</li>
    <li> Be careful buying these for people who actually need them.  The first time it was used, it seemed to work fine but after that, the seal broke within minutes and I wouldnt trust it for an elderly person needing support.  I read reviews from people who said they needed to replace the hold each time it was intended to be used, and I was okay with that.  But after placing it, it was only less than a minute before the seal started giving way.  I guess if you get it to stick and test it before each shower, you might be okay but for me, I found it was much safer just to buy a shower bench and let them sit on that before I help them out.</li>
    <li> The first couple weeks, they stuck fine...but my problem also lies in the fact my tiles are more the 4x4 size and it is difficult to find two that are perfectly aligned to let the suction cups stick to the center of the tile, which is ABSOLUTELY necessary to be secure.</li>
    <li> We bought the shower bar. We have 4-inch tiles in our bathroom, like most houses in the US. The instructions that come with the bar discuss use of the bar on 4-inch tiles, but the bar is designed in such a way that it will not work on 4-inch tiles. It will work on some other surfaces, but will not work on the most popular tile size.    The manufacturer ignored our email plea for help or advice.    If you have 4-inch bathroom tiles, do not buy this device and expect it to work.</li>
    <li> This product is a lifesaver for my wife. It gives her great support in the shower, and is incredibly easy to install.</li>
    <li> easy to attach... works as advertized... priced right... was not made in America...only bad thing about it.... to many words to have to write!~!!!!</li>
    <li> He can&#x27;t bear weight on one foot and is using this bar to help him get on the stool in the bathtub.  It has come undone every time he has used it.  I&#x27;m not rating this lower than three stars because I think wetting it each time would help.  Also, I think it might be best used to try to regain balance rather than intentionally help bear 250 lbs of weight.  If you can get a metal grab-bar actually screwed into a stud, that would be much better.  If you can&#x27;t, then I think this still might have merit.</li>
    <li> I was initially concerned that they would work. I was afraid they would pull off the wall. Believe me they won&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have anything before and I was afraid I would slip or fall in the tub while taking a shower. It&#x27;s a scary feeling knowing that your don&#x27;t have anything to grab onto while your in the shower if you start to fall or slip.  Now I don&#x27;t have those feeings and I feel safe.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a hand towel bar to suction onto my shower.  This looks good and works great for that purpose.  I have tried to pull it off but can&#x27;t...</li>
    <li> Does not stick well too shower wall.... Do not depend on this to support your whole weight,  will fail off the wall and cause you to fall.</li>
    <li> I read pro and con reviews about the suction grab bar and decided to take a chance.  My mother was coming to visit, and I needed a safety solution for the bathroom, and I needed it quickly.  This was not it.  The bar would not stick to the fiberglass shower surround or the smooth, painted wall.  I took it around the house to see what it would stick to.  Glass or the metal front door were the only successes.  This will go back.  It&#x27;s the sort of thing that should work but just doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after my wife damaged her knee and experienced problems getting into and out of the shower.  It has been in use for about six months now and has never lost suction or had to be re-installed.  It has been a terrific physical assist which provides support and confidence to my wife.</li>
    <li> Since turning 80, my mom (who lives with my husband and me) has had issues with her balance.  Her doctor recommended that we install shower handle bars in our bathroom--two on the wall and one for each side of the tub.  They really help to steady her whether she&#x27;s showering or in the tub.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about her slipping and falling.</li>
    <li> homeowners are very happy with this product.  We will be sure to use it again in the near future. Thank you</li>
    <li> I will never again order anything from Amazon. I ordered One (1) grab bar and I received not one but threeof them and was charded different prioces for each of them.</li>
    <li> I purchased this bar to aid my elderly father .  It will not stay attached to the wall.  We have followed the directions and it still falls off in the middle of the night scarring him to death.  I have removed the bar.  I am concerned that if he grabs it the bar it might cause him to fall if it does not stay in place.</li>
    <li> Good workmanship, handles stick to shower wall very well.&lt;br /&gt;Bought two for Seniors that needed additional safety while showering.</li>
    <li> Am I the only one who read the dirctions and the taped on warning?????  It clearly states this bar is for Leverage, Not Pounce All Your Weight On It &amp; See What Happens.    After spinal surgery this is a great product for peace of mind when you firt start standing on your own in the shower.  However,  I still kept my shower bench with handles available in case I needed something to support my entire weight.    I almost didn&#x27;t purchase this product after reading some of the reviews in here.  Then....I read the products specifications.    Glad I purchased it, and I recommend it to anyone who needs something for leverage only.   If you need something to hold all your weight keep looking.</li>
    <li> have a member of the family that is disabled and I would recommend this product for the safety factor it proivides for the person using the devise and the peace of mind it will give the caregiver this is a wonderful product does not need instulation like so many standard grab bars require simple to install this haS BEEN A LIFESAVER AND GIVEN ME PEACE OF MIND WHILE HE SHOWERS</li>
    <li> We bought this product to take with us while traveling.  My husband is 88, and needs an occasional assist with balance, especially in showers where no grab bar at all is provided. It does not weigh much, can be inserted in the side of a suitcase taking up very little space, and was wonderful to have.  Yes, you need to check the suction every time you use it. And, no, you cannot swing from it like a monkey.  That said, it functioned exactly as we had hoped, and we would highly recommend it for someone willing to use it as directed.</li>
    <li> Suction cups do not adhere to tile that is not totally smooth. If the surface has any deviation at all from smooth, the grip does not sustain the hold. Too dangerous.</li>
    <li> very helpful after my husband had his surgery this pass year. made him feel very secure and comfortable getting in and out of the shower.</li>
    <li> Will not attach securely to any of the tiled or fiberglass surfaces I have tried</li>
    <li> Do not lean on this bar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not pull sideways on this bar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pulling on it straight, it&#x27;s almost impossible to remove it without removing tile also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it for extra stability...and just having anything but a flat wall will help you to keep your balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remove it, clean the wall and reinstall it once a week for peace of mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this as a temporary handhold device for about 3 months after surgery and never had a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I installed a metal unit for my Mother using long screws into the studs behind the tile...because our needs were different. Assess your needs and make your purchase accordingly and either product will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be safe and I wish you a speedy recovery.</li>
    <li> It turned out that all our tile has a slightly bumpy pattern, and the suction won&#x27;t stick. I can&#x27;t use it anywhere.</li>
    <li> I tried using it a number of times. Both of the items repeatedly fell off shower wall after 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> Please pay attention to the instructions ~ this bar is not designed to hold your full weight, only to help you stay balanced.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 90 year old father in law who visits his daughters.  He is a touch unsteady on his feet and, since the bar is portable, he can carry it to each daughter&#x27;s home as he visits.  Good suction, stable.  Five stars easily.</li>
    <li> This is one of those suction cup grab bars.  They are only as strong as the suction they can create -- which is very darn little.  A tiny child could pull one off the wall  My husband bought a set; sometimes they fell off the wall before anyone ever tried to use one.</li>
    <li> THIS BAR IS UNSAFE AND SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM SALE I HAVE GIVEN IT A FAIR TRIAL ON A SUPER CLEAN TILE WALL. DO NOT USE UNLESS YPOU HAVE A PRIMARY PERM ATTACHED SAFETY BAR. I HAVE CLEANED TILE SEVERAL TIMES AND CHECK THE BAR TO IBSURE IT IS STUCK. BUT WHEN I GO TO USE IT TO HELP STEADY MYSELF GETTING IN OR OUT OF THE TUB 8 OUT OF 10 TIMES IT COMES LOOSE. IF I WERE NOT HOLDING TO ANOTHER BAR I WOULD HAE FALLEN AND MAY HAE HAD A SERIOUS INJURY.. AMAZON SHOUD REMOE THESE SUCTION PRODUCTS FROM THEIR ON LIKE SALES....</li>
    <li> Made well and securely holds on smooth shower surface. Big enough to easily grab if needed. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I should have read the reviews more carefully; but this is less than an inferior product:  bottom suction cup does not hold tightly to the wall, so it is virtually worthless.</li>
    <li> I fell in the tub and cracked my head open, this bar gives me a sense of security while getting in and out of the tub.</li>
