<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product is easy to use. My boyfriend loved it!</li>
    <li> I like this hair clipper. It&#x27;s not quite the same as the clippers we usually see. It is light and has a long handle, so it&#x27;s easy to hold it comfortably in your hand. It comes with a rechargeable battery which gives a lot of flexibility in use. It does a pretty good job in giving you a clean hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it is a little bit too pricey, which is why I give it a 4-star rating instead of 5.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Fast, doesn&#x27;t get hot or snag my skin.  Doesn&#x27;t get quite as short as I&#x27;d like but I like the look.  Hair ends up like day one or two after a really close clip.</li>
    <li> For some reason mine will not run long enough to complete a job even after I charge and recharge it four times.</li>
    <li> I like it. Cuts extremely well, and I&#x27;m one of those guys who can&#x27;t look in the mirror and figure out what side of my head I&#x27;m cutting. So its sharpness allows me to skim the surface of my hair without doing any real damage, where I end up bald (in a quest to even things up).</li>
    <li> I currently own a Remington Titanium clipper set to trim my sideburns and hair between haircuts.  The Remington works well if you keep it and all of the detachable combs in one place, but the size and weight of the cutter as well as the number of blades you need to carry to cut different lengths of hair is inconvenient to take with you if you are traveling.   The Philips Norelco Qc5130/40 Hair Clipper seemed an ideal solution to this problem.       The comb on the front of the cutter is adjustable which eliminates the need to have detachable combs of different sizes.   The cutter itself is lightweight due to the plastic body.  The shape of the cutter is a little awkward to hold and better grips on the plastic body would have been helpful.  The on / off switch slides easily for ease of use.     The combs are adjustable by pulling them away from the body.  There are markings in millimeters to indicate the height of the cut.  The combs can be pulled off entirely to use the trimmers to straighten sideburns, for example which is a nice feature.  The combs are made of plastic but attached at the back of the cutter.  This gives them a lot of play relative to each other which is different to the rigid combs of the Remington.  The flexibility of the combs does not affect the quality of the cutting, but it does give rise to questions about how durable the combs are.    I have been pleased with the job the Philips Norelco clipper does with trimming my hair once I got used to setting the height of the combs correctly.  I would certainly recommend the Philips Norelco clipper if you want to bring a hair clipper with you when you travel.  I do, however question the durability of the combs over time which is why I gave the clippers only 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised. I like the fact that it&#x27;s not heavy at all but the battery hold charge for a very long time. It is for personal use and my girlfriend give me a hair cut every 2 weeks or so. We have had it for several months and I only had to charge it once. Since it was new I wanted to wait till battery was fully exhausted. Not to mention even when the power was getting weaker I still had to let it run on a towel for like half an hour to make it completely stop running. Very impressed with the quality, price and functionality. I&#x27;d recommend this to a friend that&#x27;s looking for a economical and highly reliably buzzer that doesn&#x27;t add weight. Great for travel as well. I shall come back and update if it breaks but so far so good. Hope my review help end your search. Best of luck.  Update: I originally gave this item 5 stars due to price at $30 and functionality. However, after a few months the battery started to lose charge. I believe it is because the device doesn&#x27;t automatically stop charging if you leave it plugged in for a whole day. I bumped it down to 2 stars after realizing the price increased to $60. Since it is an old design/hardware and no gold or silver parts are in it, the 50% inflation is artificial.</li>
    <li> These clippers are super light and work great. I had gotten other clippers that were too heavy in my hand. I&#x27;m African-American and have short, natural hair. I want to shape up my hair line at  home without the $ and inconvenience of going to salon. Get these.</li>
    <li> best value for money. excelent prodcut.</li>
    <li> I bought my second Norelco QC5130 here on Amazon on April 27 of this year and amazingly last week I tried to use it to cut my hair and found out that it died on me. It stopped working and is now useless. I am enormously disappointed and really upset as I try to understand how this could happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2011 while I was in Canada I purchased this clipper at a drug store and it lasted me for three whole years until the battery died. This one lasted me a mere seven months. I feel robbed and extremely disappointed because I have been an Amazon buyer for many years and something like this had never happened to me. It made me wonder if Amazon have had these clippers stored for a long time and they are selling them even though they may not be able to guarantee that the clipper&#x27;s battery is in brand new condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will contact Amazon and try to get an explanation from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** Update *****&lt;br /&gt;So I  was able to contact Amazon customer service tonight and they were very understanding! They basically acknowledged that it was unacceptable for this product to die in less than a year and offered me to either replace it or send a refund to my credit card. I chose the latter as I don&#x27;t feel that I can trust this hair clipper again. Top customer service from Amazon and kudos to them for that. That&#x27;s why I have been an Amazon customer for more than 15 years and will continue to be one for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> I have a miniature schnauzer which means I spend a lot of money at the groomer every year. I recently have started to learn how to groom this breed myself to (a) save some money, (b) save a lot of time in the car taking the dog two counties away every six weeks and (c) to prove to myself that I can groom a dog which is an art which has been completely mysterious to me. In order to groom a dog, I need multiple sets of clippers and really long sharp scissors as well as a wash basin, a hair dryer with vents on both sides, a smock, a rope, shampoo and doggy deodorant. A high table with a nonslip surface and a way to secure the dog are also quite helpful as well as the dog himself.    Seeing as the only pieces of this equipment I owned were the dog, the shampoo, the deodorant and a rope jumped at the chance to try this Norelco hair clipper. It&#x27;s not as heavy duty as the very expensive clipper my groomer uses. It&#x27;s easy to hold and I found that I could easily match the closeness of the shearing that my groomer manages on my dog. However, I don&#x27;t have a itty bitty clipper to do his tail and other detail areas. As I also don&#x27;t have the super long and ultra sharp scissors, the non-clippered areas of the dog (his furnishings on the legs and belly as well as the beard and eyebrows) look atrocious.     I also used this clipper on the nape of my husband&#x27;s neck where the hair gets all overgrown between haircuts. I was afraid of going closer for a full shave back there but it cleaned up the jungle quite nicely and gave him a more pulled together look if you ignored the uneveness. That was my fault instead of the clipper as I&#x27;m not very good at this haircutting business.    As I know very little about clippers other than this isn&#x27;t the same as the one my groomer owns, I&#x27;ll say it&#x27;s pretty good. It made my dog look better - at least the parts I used it on!</li>
    <li> I get a #3 haircut every 4-6 weeks so figured I would try this out. So far I am not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charge claims 30 minutes but it was starting to bog down after 15. I did charge as directed for the first time as well. You can plug it in directly but that kinda defeats the whole cordless design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really starts to struggle with longer hair. Maybe this would work better if I used it every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper does feel cheaply made.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the hair clipper on my husband to remove neck hair and even out the line of hair in the back, never to cut a whole head of hair. The clipper is very light and I believe plastic - some people may like the lightness, but it just felt very cheap to me. I would advise keeping this clipper as a lighter travel version rather than the main clipper that you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge was decent, but lasted about 20 minutes instead of the promised 30. The clipper did an OK job on clearing up neck hair, but it the shave was not as close as I would&#x27;ve liked and I can&#x27;t imagine that it&#x27;d be adequate for shaving a whole head.</li>
    <li> I started using clippers to cut my husbands hair about a year ago in order to save some money.  The clippers that we initially purchased were horrible - they would constantly freeze up and we would need to grease them up to get them working again - it became such a pain that I gave up.  When I saw the Philips, I thought I would give it a try and I am so happy that I did.  The unit charged super quickly.  It comes with an adjustable comb to get various lengths - which is super convienient for storage purposes.  When I used it to shave my husbands hair - it worked wonderfully - it shaved with precision and ease.  Great clippers!</li>
    <li> As other reviews note, these clippers are lightweight - this shouldn&#x27;t be mistaken for a commercial grade grooming product. However, I&#x27;ve found it to be more than adequate for my purposes (cleaning up hair on my neck, trimming around my ears, and \\&quot;blending\\&quot;  work on haircuts). I don&#x27;t shave my head so I can&#x27;t comment on using it in that manner.    There are a items/features items that would make the clippers a lot better (charge indicator, travel case, storage clip for the cleaning brush, replaceable battery), but most surprising is that the product description on the Amazon page doesn&#x27;t match what I received: \\&quot;High quality AA battery, Protection cap, 2 Trimming combs - 2 eyebrow combs, long and short.\\&quot; None of these items were in my set. So, heads-up.    All in all, it&#x27;s not perfect...but it&#x27;s be good for me.</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair 90% of the time (one length, fades, clean-up, etc.) and my son&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve been through over 10 different clippers in the past 15 years. Half of them became inoperable for one reason or another, a few were returned immediately because they wouldn&#x27;t get the job done, and three still in use (a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; Wahl, kids Norelco, &amp; a promising Remington). Then there is this fellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The materials and construction are overly cheap, in particular the black plastic housing the blade mechanism. It didn&#x27;t take long before portions of it started breaking. The blades are barely mediocre, even for a $20 set of clippers. The teeth are small and the actuation design is too simplistic for consistent cuts. This translates into a mostly hollow business end and an annoying uneven weight distribution. The adjustable comb length is less of a convenience and more tedious compared to other Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve owned. The only reason for the 2nd star is a reasonable battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an adjustable cordless clipper, I recommend shopping around and spending a little more.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, since he cuts his own hair. The product is very lightweight, but still powerful. There are the usual length settings, from 1/8\\&quot; to 1\\&quot;, but you don&#x27;t have to switch any parts, since everything is attached to the main unit. Cleanup is easy; a small brush is included. The only downside is that the product does not hold a charge very well; the instructions say it will hold a charge for 30 minutes, but my husband had to use it while it was plugged in. Overall, a good, but not great, product for cutting hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for almost 20 years now, but not because my family are weirdo home schoolers who make their own clothes and cut their own hair, but because I refuse to pay someone $15 to shave my head for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up these clippers recently and let me say this:  these are fine for cutting shorter hair, say less than an inch long.  These are perfect for keeping short hair short.  These are great for trimming around your ears and neck.  These are more for maintaining a short haircut or for trimming.  These clippers won&#x27;t do a great job cutting down your David Cassidy Tribute haircut, you would need a more heavy duty set for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this Philips clipper.  It has a nice adjustable thingie for different lengths.  The clippers themselves don&#x27;t feel like the sturdiest thing ever made, but I have yet to have any sort of problem.  These will not replace my normal heavier duty clippers, but these are much nicer for upkeep and trimming.</li>
    <li> The adjustable piece that slides up or down to choose length of cut moves on its own while you are using it.</li>
    <li> Great, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> wow! It is really good!</li>
    <li> This review is a compilation of answers from questions I asked my beau after he had experimented with the Norelco. He has thick, curly, African-American hair. That may or may not matter, but I figure I should mention his hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first feel, the weight makes the Norelco seem cheap. It&#x27;s very light in the handle and heavier at the blade. But when shaving, the trimmer was easier to hold and maneuver than my old and heavy Conair. Shaving is clean, close, and even. Without the adjustable comb, the wrong angle can definitely nick you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little cleaning brush it comes with is probably just going to get lost; designers should have thought of a way to keep it attached to the trimmer. There is also no carrying case or protective cover included. The mechanism for the adjustable comb feels like it&#x27;ll break, or wear easily because it is simple plastic. Design-wise, it&#x27;s not the greatest looking trimmer I&#x27;ve seen...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I give it 3 stars for functionality. Plus, at the time of this review, Amazon does not list a price and I can&#x27;t even find the model online... so I&#x27;m not sure if the price is worth the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;01/19/13: For the price, seems it&#x27;s worth 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Deceptively powerful and easy to lose control of, this horrendous tool butchered my hair in a matter of minutes.  With limited vision of what was actually taking place, I was misled by the quiet hum of what must be a 500 horsepower engine and was lulled into a sense of security as I believed I was lightly trimming the back of my head.  It was not until I heard my small daughter&#x27;s screams and looked down in shock to see my feet ankle deep in hacked-off hair that I realized the catastrophe.  It was like waking from a nightmare to find out it was all too real!  I could not believe what I saw when I examined the slashing my hair had endured when I finally got to the bedroom where I could use additional mirrors to gaze on the stubble.  I choked back the overwhelming need to sob as I did not want to upset my little girl more than she already was.  She had already seen far too much for a child and my emotions would have just added to the trauma.  I looked down at the featherweight, toy-like clipper in my hand and could not comprehend how something so silent and tiny could do such ungodly damage to what little hair I have left at this stage of my life.  In all fairness, when placed in more experienced hands and given a better field of vision, the Norelco hair clipper could be a very useful, effective hair appliance and an excellent value.  However, the one star rating is for the average self-stylist who could easily be misled by the seemingly innocuous outward appearance of the shell that houses the stunningly overwhelming motor within.  All caution should be used during its operation and it should never be utilized while alone!  A competent adult should always be standing by to observe and guide the operator during self-styling.  An even better idea would be to have someone other than the cutting subject handle the instrument so that instantaneous mistakes can be avoided.  Even then, it must be reiterated that this is best left to experienced hands and not to those of a novice.  Once my hair grows back, that will be the plan in my own case and I will report back with what may well be a more positive updated review.  This will certainly require some months until the plan can be undertaken.  In the meantime, the accompanying dvd has been found to be quite instructive and it probably should have been given some attention before I approached my head with such a powerful tool.</li>
    <li> This a a fairly basic hair clipper. Not particularly sturdy but it works fine for occasional touchups. The charge will last for a few cuts and the attachments are decent. Overall, it functions as it should but its by no means the equivalent of a professional product.</li>
    <li> These clippers are generally good -- they work best on hair that is already shorter to begin with.  When I used them to cut ofd long hair, they had a tendency to get caught and \\&quot;stall\\&quot; -- especially with the combs on (and you&#x27;ll be using the combs unless someone is enlisting...)  ;-)  A good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Great for trimming. Love the ability to recharge the battery. Still going strong after about a year of use. I charge this about once a month, if that-- probably closer to two.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t have the option to rate the SELLER since Amazon is the one selling and shipping this clipper. I am VERY UNHAPPY that I received a Clipper that was USED AND HAS HAIR PIECES ALREADY ON IT. Granted I paid little on sale but I DID NOT PAY FOR A GARAGE SALE ITEM!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a disgrace to amazon to be selling. I have bought many things from amazon and have had good business. WHY would they sell a USED CLIPPER?? How disappointing. Not Norelco&#x27;s fault only could be the Amazon department.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Plug and play.  Happy.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD FOR KIDS HAIRCUT.</li>
    <li> the product is user friendly.&lt;br /&gt;soft on the skin, doesnt injure at all.&lt;br /&gt;does a great job trimming close to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;fast use- doesnt leave any untouched spots.</li>
    <li> Very nice and powerful! Fits my wife&#x27;s small hands.....great when I need her assistance!</li>
    <li> The blades on this hair clipper are sharp and give a very professional-looking cut. The non-lithium ion battery and the paper-light feel of the device are the only things I don&#x27;t like. These 2 things lead me to believe that the device won&#x27;t last as long as I would like. The blade-guards are nice and smooth and feel comfortable on the scalp. A good intermediary device, due to the great price, if you&#x27;re not ready to get a higher-quality one.</li>
    <li> this is very easy to use no worrying about finding different heads for the clipper just adjust the one on it  works out nicely. yes i would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Lightweight, quiet and simple to use. It is so quiet my cat will let me use it to shave his belly. I dropped it in the sink, but it took the lickin&#x27; and kept on tickin.&#x27;</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - it cuts hair, holds charge, and has a no frills adjustable guard to change the length of haircut. I pretty much just use it with the guard at the smallest setting (3mm) - and it works well. Without the guard, it can nick you so I just switched to using it all the time.  Not good for using without the guard, but matches my requirements. So far this guard has never pulled my hair and never gotten jammed with hair.</li>
    <li> Wonderful machine, works great</li>
    <li> I like the fact it can be corded or cordless. I was kind of disappointed that it only goes down to level 3 not 2 like I&#x27;m used to but overall, a good shave so far.</li>
    <li> Work good move slowbget a good cut last long ibuse them on my dog quite to</li>
    <li> Lightweight, no oiling necessary, not many parts, 3 or 4, and cut hair very short.  Took the adjustable plastic guide so I could get the closest haircut necessary then I shaved my head.  The design is interestingly conducive for cutting hair in little time!</li>
    <li> There was no #1 clip.  Not sure why its not included since I&#x27;ve seen it on other clippers.  Holds a charge well.</li>
    <li> it is very good. just the style I like. I can choose the length of my hair to be cut</li>
    <li> I bought this product product during Xmas. It worked great, the clipper was light and trimmed good. But it only lasted 4 months, one fine morning it just stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips need to work on making this product more reliable to last for at least a year!!</li>
    <li> I used a few hair clippers in my life and this is one of the best. It only took me 3 minutes to do what usually took me 6-7 minutes with my last Remington and I think that sais it all.</li>
    <li> I like it. Because it is cheap and eays to used.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loves it and says its really easy to use. He just shaves his head so its not too complicated but he loves it!</li>
    <li> This does a great job with general grooming.  I wouldn&#x27;t think that this would be a barbers tool of choice as it doesn&#x27;t seem very heavy duty, but for use around the home it should hold up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had to worry about the battery life as of yet. Like most rechargable devices, I would not leave this plugged in when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustible gaurd seems to stay in place just fine, as the release tab is on the side of the unit and it takes quite a bit of pressure to to change the setting by pushing on the top of the gaurd. This should not be used gaurd-free, as you will nick yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not having to wrestle with a cord is great and I have not seen any power loss when using cord-free!</li>
    <li> I am a full time hair stylist at Great Clips. This adjustable clipper guard is great. I don&#x27;t have to change the guard for a fading at all.</li>
    <li> this Cordless hair clipper makes it easy to use.  price is great.  this is a big money saver for me. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> These clippers don&#x27;t feel very sturdy, but they do a decent job. I really like the single, adjustable length guard. While it will render the clippers totally useless when it eventually breaks, for now it&#x27;s nice to now have to keep track of several different guards. The guards do a good job at giving an even shave, although without the guard, they don&#x27;t give quite as close a shave as I would like to see. They do a decent, but not spectacular job.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for cutting hair but have used it for cutting and trimming my beard. Nice and easy adjustments for hair length and the comb is easily removed to use the clipper for trimming and shaving a beard. The comb tips are a little sharp. If one has little bumps on one&#x27;s scalp it might hurt them but, looking at other clippers, most have the same type adjustable comb with points. Motor is good and strong. I haven&#x27;t had to recharge it so can&#x27;t tell how long a charge will last or how long it will take to re-charge.</li>
    <li> Using it means you can do it yourself. It can save your time and money when you have limitted resources.</li>
    <li> I previously received a similar model as a gift over 10 years ago, this was a can&#x27;t miss miss purchase for the price, works well when traveling abroad as I so often do.</li>
    <li> This hair trimmer works great and at a very acceptable price (compared to other makes I checked out).  Saves me a lot of money.</li>
    <li> I ordered it for my little baby.  I was shocked when I pushed the button.  Too nosiy at all, for adult is ok, but baby may not feel comfortable.</li>
    <li> I use this to shave my head, works great for that purpose</li>
    <li> Very good items, you deserve!&lt;br /&gt;Very light weight, easy to operate.&lt;br /&gt;Sound is very small, not hair clip.&lt;br /&gt;Use up super convenient.</li>
    <li> Thank you for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are very good products feel good purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ask for a better product in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> The product is simple good. Works very well. Although I used twice I recommend the product to other. Have a nice cut.</li>
    <li> It works like a charm.  Had it 3 months, haven&#x27;t charged it yet...after four mohawks!  GF not so happy... she prefers the hippie look... she can goto Portland,OR!!!</li>
    <li> I use this to shave my head every month or so to save on haircuts.  I like it because it doesn&#x27;t vibrate as much as my old clipper did.</li>
    <li> It has the same quality as the one I bought in China (of the same model same brand). I repurchased it because I washed the old one with water and it stopped working. So be careful to keep it away from liquids. The only thing I was confused about is that it is much cheaper than the old one I bought in China, while they are both made in China. At first I was worried that they probably won&#x27;t be the same. So to all the Chinese buyers who travel between the two countries, buy them in the US!</li>
    <li> Holds a charge well (usually get 2 or 3 head shavings per charge.) Very light. Very effective. Also quite difficult to cut yourself by accident.  EDIT: Took a star off because after about 10-15 charges, it does drastically lose its charge and probably will need to be plugged in after about 5 minutes. Otherwise still works flawlessly.</li>
    <li> I replaced a Norelco multifunction with this and a Philips Norelco BG2028/42 Bodygroom 3100 and I&#x27;m very happy with both.  The QC5130 Hair Clipper has good power and a long battery life.  I keep my hair buzzed and with Norelco&#x27;s rounded cutter tips I can use this without the guide comb and cut my hair as short as possible.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on a higher end cutter or a multifunction.  This will do a better job for far less money.</li>
    <li> Small, handy, easy to use. Cuts out all unnecessary elements of 10-15 attachments which are inbuilt in one attachment. Great buy and great price.</li>
    <li> I am practicing. It is so easy to operate. The battery is enough for one cut. After that it is necessary to recharge complete.</li>
    <li> I had a great trimmer that finally lost its&#x27; charging ability. I ordered this due to the price. While I am not a fan of this product, I will get used to it.</li>
    <li> Well they do clip hair and are very strong.  The angle of the clippers is different but nothing to complain about.  My only negative is the guard and I knew it would suck before I purchased it.  A moron developed this trimmers guard because it flimsy and HUGE!!!.  When grooming the man parts I can use no guard for 70% of the job and not get cut but I dare not use this on the jewels for fear of running out of TP to stop the bleeding!  Obvious oversight of the female engineer who designed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably use my dremmel tool to modify the guard so to accommodate a male user.</li>
    <li> No real complaints, but not really impressed either. It is a good, basic level clipper. It is nice that it is wireless, but I end up plugging it in anyway.</li>
    <li> Michael.Stone(International graduate student from China)&lt;br /&gt;Here is some of my personally view that may help u~&lt;br /&gt;1Convenient to travel from a 220V voltage range country to 110V country.&lt;br /&gt;2.good looking+easy to use+easy to clean after use.&lt;br /&gt;3.cheap but useful(cause I got $10 discount,only pay20+tax,maybe $22 I think) and I think it is also worth to pay the list price $30!&lt;br /&gt;4.famous brand that I can trust.&lt;br /&gt;6.most important:I always buy sth. from Amazon directly.and Amazon never let me down from China to US .So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;Now it is only cost 10$!!!come on!guys</li>
    <li> I use this to cut the hair for my 4-year-old son. It is quiet,  light weight and easy to use. The only concern is the plastic comb looks won&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Decent clipper for the money but it has its flaws.  I&#x27;ll mention 2 of biggest flaws.  1. The Length adjustment can easily move out of position into a different length.&lt;br /&gt;2. The battery life is pretty short.</li>
    <li> Gave it as a gift and really did not get any negative feed back&lt;br /&gt;from it - so I can only say the person liked it or did not have the&lt;br /&gt;nerve to tell me he hated it.</li>
    <li> My requirements were basic, a basic, powerful, multi-length, corded/cordless, no-oil clipper, this one satisfies all. the only precaution is that it takes sometimes to adopt to adjustable comb operation, it holds well, but if you are used to holding the clipper close to the head you can easily engage the comb mechanism and slide it up and down,keep your grip below the switch and you are safe.  Update 4/24/2016: dropping the rating from 5 to 2, the motor just gave in (about 2 years of operations, once or twice a month), while the cut was straight, one issue is that the comb is made from very soft plastic, if the side bends while doing a cut you end-up with a bare spot, you need to be super careful (happened many of times). I cut my own hair but I have had three other clippers prior to that one and I never had this issue with any of them.</li>
    <li> This hair clipper is great. It is very light, very simple to control cut longer, beautiful design in shape and to grab.So it is very easy to use. I have cut my hair by myself by using this hair clipper. Above all its price is great.</li>
    <li> Works great, but with enough pressure, the integrated length adjustment will slip its setting. When it happens you have to stop what you&#x27;re doing, reset it, and then proceed. If it happens more than once while using it, it can be a little annoying.</li>
    <li> I like this trimmer better than the old corded one I have used from a big box store. The only negative is the adjustable comb can move if you press too hard. This will give you a shorter spot of hair. I cut mind at the lowest setting for summer so no problem now. Winter I did have to readjust the comb some when it slipped down.</li>
    <li> Why is the description of this hair clipper geared towards women? I&#x27;m a man on a budget and this thing only cost me $11.99 where as a haircut down here in the Keys would cost me $18 + a tip. \\&quot;Made for women&#x27;s hands\\&quot;? I&#x27;m gonna grip this ^%&amp;$ like a *@%!#^% broadsword and slay some fur.</li>
    <li> Received the item today and along with it a bunch of hair from the previous person who returned it. Im surprised and disappointed in Amazon that they did not even do basic inspection of an item before sending it out or refurbishing it when someone returns it before reselling the item. I have not used the product, dont think its hygenic to use it when it has already been used by someone else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s hair for a while. We have a Wahl, multi-colored set with all the various attachments. I thought with the money we&#x27;ve saved on home cuts, we could splurge a little and get this clipper too. I&#x27;m still getting used to the sliding length guide, but do like that there are no attachments to keep track of. My favorite feature is that it&#x27;s cordless. I haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet, (done 4 cuts so far.), and the freedom of no cord is surprising. I didn&#x27;t think that it would make that much of a difference, but it really does. I also love how convenient it is to just grab to do little trims on the guys - much easier to just chase them down, (stand them in the shower to avoid any mess), and touch things up between cuts.</li>
    <li> Price is reasonable. Haven&#x27;t used it, but it looks good. The product matches the description and the picture.  Recommend it</li>
    <li> Very lightweight in that your instincts tell you it&#x27;s cheaply made - that&#x27;s not the case.  It cuts very well and very smooth with no pulling.  I shave my head so I don&#x27;t use the plastic measuring attachment, I removed it and this clipper cuts my hair very smoothly and close to the scalp without a problem.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, not to loud, which is great when using for kids. This was a great buy. Will save money.</li>
    <li> Like the way the attachments are built in. Great feel to the handle. Smooth cutting and trimming. It is the best clipper I ever owned.</li>
    <li> Much lighter than the old clippers I used. It is also much easier to clean than the old clippers. Just flip it open and brush it out. Battery life is good too. I use it once a week and I have not had to charge it since its initial charge. This has been about 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> This is a bit bigger than I expected but it works well. I got it after slickdeals.net mentioned the sale on amazon. I ended up getting it for 10 bucks, all in. So can&#x27;t complain about anything. It&#x27;s a bit bigger than I expected but isn&#x27;t very noisy when you run it. It&#x27;s just one of those you&#x27;d see at a hair salon, which means technically, you have used it before without really using it yourself.</li>
    <li> Lasted forever in between charges. Decently sharp. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do! Not the most powerful unit, so when I clipped my friend&#x27;s very long hair it took longer than it probably would have with a plug-in unit. But then again I was able to clip outside since this one doesn&#x27;t require a cord, making cleanup very easy.</li>
    <li> great product.&lt;br /&gt;Works corded and wireless.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it only a couple of times and it seems to do the job well.</li>
    <li> First, this clipper is very easy to clean. You can open up the clipper from up top then clean all the hair from the inside.&lt;br /&gt;Second, this clipper is very sharp. I was able to trim my head in 7 minutes in 1 setting. $23 worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Third, it&#x27;s lightweight, I can barely feel it.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, it&#x27;s rechargeable. I was able to trim my hair in 1 setting w/o the power cord.</li>
    <li> Looks so fine,I hope should be used more time.last time the one was not comfortable which I buy it before</li>
    <li> Product was good overall, however, there is no lock for the guard. Needless to say my husband had to cut his hair really short because the guard slipped.</li>
    <li> Works very well and is easier to clean than my previous Wahl clipper. I shave my head about once a week. This little guy does the job comfortably and without issue. It does seem a bit cheaply flimsy and I suspect that if I were to drop it, I&#x27;d need to buy a new clipper. So I guess I won&#x27;t drop it. It has worked very well for the few months I&#x27;ve had it, though.</li>
    <li> This is an absolute crap! Low quality  battry and low quality materials. It totally stopped working after 5 months (i usually use on a weekly basis)!!!</li>
    <li> My husband shaves his head once a week, on average, at the shortest clipper setting he can find. (He&#x27;d love to shave it bald, but that isn&#x27;t as easy as using the shortest clipper setting.)&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up for him thinking that when he goes on business travel he would be able to keep himself easily and comfortably groomed.&lt;br /&gt;It feels out of the package like a toy. Very lightweight, very flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;On a full charge it would barely trim without &#x27;hiccuping&#x27;, and again his hair is short, approx. 1/4\\&quot; is the longest he lets it get.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe for tidying up longer hair styles, this would work, or if you absolutely positively must cut your hair on the run, (but he says a flowbee would work better.)&lt;br /&gt;For him, he&#x27;s going to stick with his trusty corded.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2T598JWGX2T02]]It&#x27;s a shaver. What can be said for it in 2 minutes? It&#x27;s a good shaver and I&#x27;ll tell you that much at least.</li>
    <li> I love it, but sometimes I go a bit too short. It has mm measurements on it, I clean it after each use, it works very well.</li>
    <li> best money ive ever spent.,&lt;br /&gt;easy to use,,light weight, fits your hand,&lt;br /&gt;cordless,,woow.,does the job in half the time.,&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended...</li>
    <li> The motor is strong enough to do the job. Problem is the depth guide. It is so flimsy that teeth bend which leaves large grooves in my hair. If you don&#x27;t use a guide then this unit is ok. My wife prefers me to keep a little bit longer hair so i need to find another clipper.</li>
    <li> Still pretty good after several months of use.&lt;br /&gt;The gap between the motor compartment and cutting edge is a bit wide. Hair gets in the motor compartment and needs to be cleaned every time after use.</li>
    <li> have had ones that cost more and did not do the great job this one does&lt;br /&gt;also love how easy to adjust the height</li>
    <li> I am a hair dresser by trade and had hair clippers for home use that had the retractable head, of which I loved and used for many years with the clipper finally breaking.  It is a pain to have to trade out the clipper heads for different uses, so am very pleased that this one does just that.  It is as expected and am pleased with it.</li>
    <li> The basic question is: do these clippers work to cut hair? Yes, they do, and work well for this task. They are lightweight, inexpensive and easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, there are a few negative points with these clippers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The rechargeable battery inside is not replaceable. The instructions for the clippers instruct you how to take the clipper apart, remove the battery and properly dispose of it. But there is no mention of a way to replace the battery, because the pack is soldered to the clippers.&lt;br /&gt;-No charge indicator. My Philips Sonicare toothbrush has a handy lcd indicator to show me how much charge is left. There is nothing on the clippers to indicate charge status - not even a LED that changes color (like my gameboy has). And -- by the way, the manual cautions you against repeatedly charging the battery without periodically discharging it. Fortunately, you can use the clippers with the provided cord if the battery dies while cutting hair.&lt;br /&gt;-Adjustable clipper length is a single piece of plastic that slides up and down on the cutter head to determine hair length. It works okay except for tight work (mustaches). The plastic looks like it would break into several pieces if you dropped the clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is the clippers work fine, and the light weight is a asset - but the lack of a battery indicator is a real drag, and the replaceable battery is unfortunate - from a potential landfill standpoint, but also from a frugality standpoint - throwing away a perfectly functioning item just because it needs a new battery.</li>
    <li> I charged for literally 10hrs+, and last me like 15mins, couldn&#x27;t even finish one single client.&lt;br /&gt;Blades are good though.</li>
    <li> Does the job greatly. Easy to use and to clean. Comparing to an earlier product from Philips that I used before, it&#x27;s more quiet. I never tested the time of work to the limit, but for a 15-30 minute haircut I think it works fine.</li>
    <li> My hubby loves it very convenient easy to use and gets the job done in notime. No worries about having to wait in salon for hrs super happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to like...easy to use, no oil needed, and cordless??? Yep...good stuff!!</li>
    <li> Just bought it based on Amazon reviews, and was seriously disappointed. Comb plastic is very soft and bends easily (common problem to many cutters as I have read in reviews, sadly noone said this before about this cutter), so no expectations to make accurate cut at other lenghts than the minimum one with comb, especially if head surface is uneven (mine is). I&#x27;m cutting myself very short, but I doubt if I will be able to cut my child well.  Also pretty noisy - would not call it quiet as advertised.</li>
    <li> Great product. Blade is wide so it takes less time to shave. Smooth to the skin. Better than most any other brand.</li>
    <li> I saved so much money on doing my own haircuts. This makes it easy!</li>
    <li> Works great. Adjustable height. Very long time battery. Light, compact and can be used with soap.  Universial power charger. You can use. 110V to 240 V power source.</li>
    <li> works like a charm. the hair on the sides of my head grow outwards unlike most people who have them growing downwards. this will go a long way to helping me keep them short and tidy.</li>
    <li> I just wish the guides allowed for a longer cut ,but I knew that when I bought it.I&#x27;ve gotten 1 full haircut and 2 trims on 1 charge.</li>
    <li> Bought it on sale.. very good product for kids who are scared of strong vibrations and sound from 110 electric clippers... it paid for itself on the first haircut..</li>
    <li> So good, it makes my hair cut work so easy! The design is good, it is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is not a well balanced, well designed item. It sometimes feels like it&#x27;s plucking rather than cutting. I have a fantastic Wahl cordless trimmer but it won&#x27;t hold a charge and isn&#x27;t manufactured anymore.</li>
    <li> Light weight and effective.  So far it&#x27;s been very good.</li>
    <li> I shave my head and this is the best clippers I have used yet.  Charge lasts forever and the build quality feels good.</li>
    <li> Good, but somewhat noisy</li>
    <li> Now I just set it at 1/4&amp;#34; and run it over my head each week and my hair is always perfect. I love it and would suggest you buy it .</li>
    <li> You can take the Philips Norelco Hair Clipper right out of the box and start cutting hair. I like the small head as it will shave closer over the ears and make the neck look better. Has a handy comb that you move to the length you want the hair cut. Seems like it will be real handy, but am concerned that the comb may slip to  a different length while cutting as there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any guard to hold it in place, especially if you have a lot of curly hair to cut. Overall, I think it is going to be very handy.</li>
    <li> very good product, although it was build using cheap material. Not sure how long it will last, but it worth the money.</li>
    <li> Awesome.  Cut my husband&#x27;s hair in no tome.</li>
    <li> We have been so pleased with these.  I have been cutting my husbands hair and now our sons hair for 10+ years.  We have gone bought at least 5 different types/brands of clippers.  These are hands down my favorite.  I do not have to mess with a cord.  The blades cut smooth and leave no strays.  I typically use #5, #4, #3 guards.  The settings on this clipper offer in between guards for better blending.  My husband said that when he rubbed his hands through his hair it reminded him of the way it felt when he would have it done by the barber.  I hope this helps someone else.</li>
    <li> great. cut my own hair once in a while. thought looks OK but wife said no good. Has the &amp;#34;layered&amp;#34; effect.Got it while on promotion sale. so its worth it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent item. i have bought plenty of these in the past... and this by far is the best!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this buzzer.&lt;br /&gt;Its works very well!</li>
    <li> I was a Hair Dresser and have always cut my own hair  ,this clipper is excellent and very easy to use. Always does a nice neat job.</li>
    <li> I have but a lot of clippers.  My wife saw these on amazon and got them for me for my birthday.  Hands down awsome.  The blades are sharp cuts thru my sons and mine hair with easy.  The battery seems pretty good.  i have to charge it every 2 hair cuts (thats four total as i cut my sons at the same time.)  i have had the clippers for about a year and i am very  pleased highly recommend.  The gaurd is removable for a super tight cut.  be careful around the ears as they will nick you without the guard.</li>
    <li> Not good for thick, curly hair.This was not a sufficient device for us but it would be great for someone with average-thin textured hair.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re African American. I beg of you, please please please avoid this product. It will take a while for your hair to recover. Believe me :(</li>
    <li> This is just to buy&lt;br /&gt;My choice is not wrong very good</li>
    <li> For the price this hair clipper has been great. The wireless functionality works great and the adjustable comb works as intended.</li>
    <li> Recently received these and have only used them once so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do a really good job of cutting low without the guard on.  About as low as I&#x27;ve ever gotten it without a razor.  The problem is they&#x27;re irritating against my skin.  The super cheap Conair Stubble Trimmer I have doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin but also doesn&#x27;t cut quite as low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this pint I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll keep them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Reviewed by Tracie&#x27;s husband)</li>
    <li> I like this hair trimmer, in fact it&#x27;s become my default haircut piece. The main cause of the ding is 1) it&#x27;s plastic and feels kinda cheaply built, though I haven&#x27;t had issues yet, and 2) the built in adjustable clip is limited to short lengths. At the longest setting this will give you a pretty short haircut. Also, you can&#x27;t use other clips so you&#x27;re kinda stuck with a short haircut unless you use another clipper set.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Battery holds charge for a long time.</li>
    <li> Love the price with the coupon.  My son needed a clipper and had just asked about getting one.  So this made a perfect on-time gift.</li>
    <li> I bought this one as it was advertised that it comes with instruction DVD as I was trying DIY clipper for the first time but I was wrong as there was no DVD in the packaging. Also quality is so so.. Didn&#x27;t find it very robust.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a couple of weeks ago when they had a coupon. This clipper is very easy to use, enough power to cut my short hair and can be used both with and without the power cord. I have been looking for something cheap to keep my hair clean and this is the perfect product.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this is very easy to use. I have used it just once til now. It came already charged so that saved me some time.&lt;br /&gt;The little brush which came with it was quite effective in cleaning. I would buy this again for the amount that I paid (Got a coupon from Amazon and got this for $10 !! )</li>
    <li> Nice and cheap. Works in corded mode or cordless. For cordless, you need to charge the batteries for 10 hours to get 20-40 minutes of shaving, so I use cordless only as a \\&quot;backup method&amp;#34. For less than $10, you can&#x27;t go wrong if you&#x27;re hair trimming needs are simple.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used countless clippers and this is the first set where my hair looked like a bear had attacked it. There were claw marks from the adapter claws spreading and cutting certain areas too short. When the attachment is removed, it works great. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t like my hair that short.</li>
    <li> Surprised how good this clipper is!  I used it on my 18-month-old daughter for  a stacked hairstyle on the back.</li>
    <li> I had purchased a 20+ piece Wahl set to cut my husband&#x27;s hair. It came with a little cape, scissors, clippers, guides, and everything. After one use, it was relegated to storage forever because my husband said &amp;#34;What the hell did you do&amp;#34; and refused to let me near his head anymore. But me still trying to save a couple bucks, bought this clipper based on the reviews, and was not disappointed. It&#x27;s super easy to use and appears to be truly idiotproof. First cut with it looks pretty darn good imo. It&#x27;s also very light, cleanup is easy. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Would recommend this trimmer for the long battery life, the built-in, but removable trim length adjuster, and the fact that you don&#x27;t have to deal with oiling the blades.  The topper was that with a ten off coupon that was being offered at the time, the OOP cost was just under eight.  Just something to bare in mind.</li>
    <li> The blades are sharp and the adjustable blades are easy to change out. Its a little bulky and heavy compared to previous clippers I have bought but overall a good purchase.  Its wider cutting diameter and design allows for a more comfortable shave on back or side hair.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied, it was very good, thank you very much.The only regret is that voice is bigger, the baby with is not very good.</li>
    <li> This holds a pretty good charge and my god it is very light. It cuts pretty good and you can trim your hair with it as well so it&#x27;s a good buy... I paid $10-$12 for it so I wouldn&#x27;t pay anything more than $15 for it.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my father, he will cut my hair when he came to my home. I wish it is good enoght!</li>
    <li> Blades are not sharp. I like in this clipper is it can be charged and used for 3-4 times and also light weight.</li>
    <li> It is smooth in the hand, precise cut&lt;br /&gt;and weight almost nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.&lt;br /&gt;I had realy a hard time to find so a good product like this.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it every half hour four days a week. The most clippers are havy and vibrating like grazy in the hand so that after 3 haircuts my hand hurts.&lt;br /&gt;I got excactly what I loked for.</li>
    <li> Comfortable and easy to use and clean.  I cut my hair short - use the number 1 setting on my bald head - it clips quietly and smoothly compared to a clipper (another brand) that I had been using.  Light weight does not seem to indicate inferior quality.... have been using it each week over the last several months.</li>
    <li> you describe it &amp;#34;Ultra quiet, reassures and calms kids (and moms) during the haircut, no loud motors here&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;i think it is exaggerated</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as close as i wish it would. Still a good buzzer for the price. I love that it&#x27;s wireless.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my son, as he wanted something compact and easy to use.  It comes with several clipper attachments and, being a Norelco, appears to be high quality.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Price, I picked this up for around 10, which is a great price.&lt;br /&gt;2. Looks great, and feels durable (It&#x27;s made of plastic but it&#x27;s not flimsy)&lt;br /&gt;3. Cuts well. I used it on myself and on my poodle and it cut through my hair without any issues and cut through the poodles without any problems as long as it wasn&#x27;t matted up hair. The matted up hair just got caught in the comb and didn&#x27;t make it to the clipper but the clipper can cut through it no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Charge indicator doesn&#x27;t let you know when it&#x27;s done charging. When it&#x27;s charging, the charge light is on. When it&#x27;s done charging, the charge light is still on. You never know if its charging or completely charged.&lt;br /&gt;2. Longer hairs get caught on the comb/guide behind the clipper. Not really a big deal but still extra cleaning.</li>
    <li> well priced for what it can do. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase. I am not sure I would&#x27;ve purchased it without the 10 buck off the coupon.</li>
    <li> Currently I use this as my son and husband barber, the effect is very good, mainly can be charged, convenient.</li>
    <li> i shave with this and have had for one year and only charged it once, amazing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cut my own hair with it also, perfect for me</li>
    <li> Very light and works as described. If you are looking for a high class clipper with options this is not your product. But if you are looking very a good priced regular clipper this is a good option.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper because it is supposed to be quieter than other clippers and it is.  However, the guard teeth are far apart and bend if you put just a little too much pressure, causing you to cut shorter than intended if your not careful.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that the battery doesn&#x27;t stay charged as long as previous clippers that I&#x27;ve owned.  I&#x27;ll be looking for something better.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper by only $8(with a discount coupon), and it trims my tough hair perfect !&lt;br /&gt;I believe it&#x27;s the best cheap clipper~</li>
    <li> I bought it for my 2-year old son.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quiet and sharp, I can easily do a haircut all by myself.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve only tried it once, but it was a nice change from our old 10 year-old clippers which require a cord but were still weighty.  By comparison, this clipper was so light, it was like an extension of my arm.  I liked the built-in clip, was afraid that it would slip in the settings, but had absolutely no problems with it.  I will still keep my old clippers for the day that the batteries stop holding their charge, so hopefully that will be a long time in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tempted to rate this a 5 star product, but since we&#x27;ve only used it once before, I don&#x27;t have comments yet on repeat usage.</li>
    <li> So portable and easy to use. It&#x27;s so easy to use a child could cut your hair. And you can cut your own hair without the cord getting in the way.</li>
    <li> I got the QC5130 at a discount store, for less then $20.  Its great!! At first your thinking this odd handle will not be easy, but it is.  I got a Cesar faux thing going, and after hours at chain store hair cutters, waiting for barber, explaining what I want, showing pictures, and paying $20, go home unhappy, I am finally happy.  I take some pomade and push all my hair to the middle of my head, then put the guard on 3/8 and start at sideburns and cut upward towards the crown.  The handle make it easy to get back of my head, no mullet here.  Then I take some scissor and trim the \\&quot;hawk\\&quot;.  Shower the pomaid out and fresh clean haircut.  The guild has a locking mechanism so it doesn&#x27;t move while pressing on your head.  You have to remove guild to trim about ears, and neckline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: not recommended for body trimming, the guild gets in the way unless your very hairy. There is not hook or stand, so it has to live in your overnight bag.  The plug comes out very very very very easy, so you go to use it and it not charged.  I don&#x27;t think it made for the shower, so no wet dry action.  Cuts dry hair well, not sure about wet.  Does white hair very well, don&#x27;t know about other hair types or races.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s definitely working fine, but it&#x27;s a light weight version of 360degree clipper from Philips, the battery won&#x27;t last long and I need to charge it every the other time, probably just 10-15mins per charge. And the size of clipper is kinda narrow which is not so efficient.  But for $10 worth try.</li>
    <li> Looks pretty good, but  I still have not used it , I hope it is very  good. thank you very much!</li>
    <li> this is good hair clipper although the first time charging time is a bit of long. First use to cut my one month old newborn hair. it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair with just scissors for more than 10 years.  I&#x27;ve wanted something like this for a while, but I hated to put down $30 or $40 for something I wasn&#x27;t sure would suit me anyway.  Norelco products have always worked well for me, so when these went on a steep sale recently, I pounced, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  After my first use, I doubt I&#x27;ll abandon my scissors completely, but I can get through the bulk of the work far more quickly (and with less effort), and get a shorter, more even cut on the sides.  The shorter cut also means I&#x27;ll be able to wait longer between cuts, so the time savings stack up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice that you can use these corded so you don&#x27;t have to be particularly attentive to how much charge it has, but although the cord is decently long (looks about 6&#x27; offhand) and the fit seems snug, after reaching and twisting and angling it, the plug will pop out of the clippers now and again.  No biggie, that&#x27;s just how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades were sharp and the engine powerful enough to slice through my thick head of hair with ease.  Philips says they blades are self-sharpening -- if they really stay this sharp for the life of the clippers, I&#x27;ll be a very happy camper.  The guide comb easily detaches for detail work, but I never had any issue with it slipping out of the length setting it was on.  The cleaning brush allows for quick clean up around the blades and various crevices on the devices and guide comb once you&#x27;re done.</li>
    <li> Sharp and functional. Multiple length for haircut. I have used it for five or six times. Never disappointed! Recommand to buy!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend who needed a decent set of hair clippers. It works great and what we like most about it is that instead of coming with different length attachments, they are built right in, all you have to do is adjust the plastic piece on the blade for different lengths. The price was unbeatable. On sale from $30 and I clipped a $10 coupon from Amazon, bringing the price down to only $10! I added $15 worth of merchandise and got free shipping too! As always, I am satisfied with my Amazon shopping experience.</li>
    <li> this a nice set of clippers. lightweight and easy to use.only problem i have is the one set of guides it comes with.wish it would have come with more than just that one. other than that they recharge nicely so recommend just for that alone</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wahl products for years and while they are good, they are often weighty and sometimes cumbersome to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative with this unit that I can foresee, is the relatively cheap plastic head which is the centerpiece of the unit.  After all,&lt;br /&gt;using it to trim your hair requires some precision and if the precision plastic \\&quot;guide\\&quot; cracks, chips or is impaired for any reason, then the unit can only be used in very limited ways.  With that said, this is an inexpensive, lightweight and easy to use trimmer.  Rather than switching out differently lengthed comb attachments, this one has a simple adjustable head that slides and clicks into the incremental measured cut desired.  It does not require oiling and is simple to clean.  A good investment which I have already used about 4 times with great results.  I will however keep my Wahl as a backup........just in case the plastic head fails on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update as of 03/22/13:  Per Philips Norelco, the adjustable guide comb can ONLY be replaced by calling their \\&quot;order desk\\&quot; @ (800) 370-6369 @ a cost of $17.95 (includes shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you register your purchase, you will receive an additional 6 months warranty (total of 2 1/2 years), plus 15% off a purchase at their website plus free shipping BUT this DOES NOT APPLY to purchases made through their \\&quot;order desk\\&quot;. Silly me, I thought a coupon offered by a company applied to the whole company.  Go figure!</li>
    <li> the picture NEVER shows a GIANT , way too big attachment on the end. I tried it and threw it in the trash. MY FAULT</li>
    <li> ...it works really well for man-scaping. (Whatever, like you&#x27;re really buying a small, cordless, under-powered hair trimmer for hair on your face/head/)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So pretty much, it&#x27;s cordless, holds a *decent* charge relatively well, and ergonomic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it once a week to trim up and I have to let it charge for a few hours every time before using. Do I *have* to have a full charge before each trim? Probably not, but the one time I didn&#x27;t it snagged a bit during use. Was it my fault for being in a rush? Probably...but it hurt, and I now associate that pain with this device. So four-stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it works well, there isn&#x27;t necessarily a charge level indicator but you can definitely hear a noticeable difference in the hum of the motor when it is low on juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go into details about the height adjuster, the way you hold it, and all that other stuff but I&#x27;ve already walked the fine line of TMI with this review so we&#x27;ll just leave it at this: If you&#x27;re buying it for the same purpose I&#x27;m using it for, go for it. It works well. Just be sure to make sure it has a good charge before you use it.</li>
    <li> Light and designed well to fit in a smaller hand.  Not too loud or with too much vibrations.  Our older one was a heavy-duty plug in model from one of those hair salon suppliers.  That thing was loud and heavy.  My wife usually cuts my hair, but I&#x27;ve found that I can do in-between touch ups myself, in the mirror.  I&#x27;ve already had three haircuts on a single charge so far.  I&#x27;m very impressed by this clipper.  It&#x27;s even better than what I was expecting.  I really like that they designed it so the guard comes right off for easy cleaning.  The missus cuts, so I clean up afterward.  Nice deal.</li>
    <li> I love this clipper. I have very fine hair and this clips smoothly and accurately and it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
    <li> This is...for sure...the best portable clipper I have ever used. I have been cutting my husbands hair for nearly 20 yra. I have rotten arthritis and this razor is light and practically does the haircut on its own. Amazing product. Also want to say someone on reviews wrote a fantastic review that led me to purchase this great product. Love reviews, don&#x27;t you?</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco QC5130 Hair Clipper  is good for me ,I like it ,it help me lot and easy to use</li>
    <li> I have already recovered the cost by not going for a hair cut. The quality is good, it never jams or cleaning is easy. You barely feel any vibrations in your hand.</li>
    <li> good!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
    <li> We have been so pleased with these. I have been cutting my husbands hair and now our sons hair for 10+ years. We have gone bought at least 5 different types/brands of clippers. These are hands down my favorite. I do not have to mess with a cord. The blades cut smooth and leave no strays. I typically use #5, #4, #3 guards. The settings on this clipper offer in between guards for better blending. My husband said that when he rubbed his hands through his hair it reminded him of the way it felt when he would have it done by the barber. I hope this helps someone else.</li>
    <li> cheap great wonderful so that&lt;br /&gt;i can not agree more&lt;br /&gt;why it is made in china but cheaper than china</li>
    <li> it is very good, I use it cut my hair very easily. I don&#x27;t like hair cut in Paraguay, I like cut my hair easily.</li>
    <li> It is not that large and you do not have as many options as you would with one of the other Norelco Clippers.  Small cutting area means it takes twice as long to use.</li>
    <li> It is great. It works perfectly. And I like it. Also it is not so expensive as the others. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair clipper for the price! I use this with ease to give my kids hair cuts.&lt;br /&gt;here are the pros so far:&lt;br /&gt;1) simple to use&lt;br /&gt;2) easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;3) quiet&lt;br /&gt;4) extremely lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;none of yet but only owned for 2 months.</li>
    <li> I only use this to take down my sideburns between hair cuts.  It holds a charge a very long time, which I like.  I bought it on sale here and I am glad I did.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very nice hair cutter. It&#x27;s so portable and easy handle. Not many part but for many different spacer.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> Super solution . No voice, work perfect</li>
    <li> The clipper is well built and easy to use. The battery life is quite long once charged. The ergonomics is very nice. The quality of the manufacture is great. Most importantly, this cuts hair very well with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small minus(es): no battery level indicator, no way to replace the permanently installed rechargeable battery. However, given the positives and the low price, I think this is a great option for an electric clipper. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Love these clippers.  I use them every couple days on my face and to cut my son&#x27;s hair every couple weeks.  They work great.  THey are definitely worth the money and I highly recommend them</li>
    <li> Pros: I&#x27;ve used this to cut short, coarse hair for the past few months and haven&#x27;t had any issues. The battery life is a little short, but you can always just plug it in and keep on cutting. The adjustable comb is easy to use, and keeps you from having to store multiple pieces. Cleanup is fairly easy as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Short battery life</li>
    <li> Works great for shaving my head.  Nice and easy with no cord.  It also is good for the nether trims too!</li>
    <li> I received the correct Hair Clipper box with completely garbage item inside the box (Incorrect item-USED OLD face electric shaver inside the correct box).</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my head for several years now, sometimes I let it grow for a week, if so I use the Norelco for crop it close before I shave again and it works great.  I take off the plastic length adjuster and use just the rounded cutting blade perfect no nicks or scratches, great  if you just want a close crop look aka Jason Stratham. The cordless use is also desirable. Thanks Norelco</li>
    <li> bought this hair clipper 3 month ago, $10, it works great, easy to use, and saved me at least $100 already :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the clipper has adjustable comb for 3-21mm length choices (1/8 - 7/8 inch), remove the comb if you like shaving clearly</li>
    <li> Trimmer works as promised.  It does not have any bells or whistles, but it cuts evenly and is easy to disassemble for cleaning.</li>
    <li> I have to think this product was defective based on the reviews I read prior to purchasing it. I clip my hair with no guard and have done it for years. On a full charge (or even full charge + plugged in) it kept catching my hair. I have thinning light hair and have never had this issue before. I would not recommend this product. I know, I know...you get what you pay for...but this thing couldn&#x27;t even do the simplest task!</li>
    <li> the packaging was perfect, but the picture i seen didn&#x27;t look like this at all.. and the razer part looked like it was cheap plastic and would break fast.  Sent it back with no problems.</li>
    <li> I got this clipper at unbeatable price. The best feature about this clipper is that it can be used wireless. It holds pretty decent charge as well.</li>
    <li> my husband love it. it is easy to use. and the price is nice.</li>
    <li> This hair clipper is good for all. It is light, chargable, can be used as cordless...and resonable price. It is Perfect!! I would recommend it to all who need hair clipper. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Not as quiet as we thought and it is kind of awkward to use.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy. Solidly built, cuts hair well, and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or shoddy. quiet function and works corded or cordless. The guard pops off to allow me to trim my beard as well.</li>
    <li> I use these to clip my horses ears.  They are quit and very good clippers.  I would buy another pair.</li>
    <li> This unit is pretty good overall, what with the quick adjust guide, which locks in tightly and doesn&#x27;t seem to be a risk to fall off mid-cut.  That is a great feature, and makes this a great purchase by itself.  However, the downside I have found is that this clipper tends to leave a ridge of hair here and there, which means you&#x27;d better have a good set of mirrors to check all around your head (if you buzz yourself like I do), or trust someone to tell you if you&#x27;ve missed a swath (no, not a &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34;, a swath).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: good clippers, but be thorough in checking your handiwork.</li>
    <li> cuts good but short battery charge.</li>
    <li> I spend about $30 a month in getting my hair cut, times 12 that&#x27;s 360 dollars a year I spend on hair cuts... This I can cut anytime I want for the fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> contrary to all the negative reviews, I love this product! it gets the job done! lightweight and slick! i would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> my lovley girlfriend gave me this for a christmas present maybe giving me a kind of hint because at time i was pulling a grizzly adams when first opening this product the statement on the box says is true it turns right on and lasts for several minutes and since christmas i have shaven over 7 times and had to only recharge one time!! so the statements for \\&quot;crappy battery life\\&quot; are not true in my experience so hopefully yours to will be the same also the shaving experience phenomenal because there is no tug and pull or anything in since its like a butter knife just grazing the top of a bar of butter.</li>
    <li> Great clipper for home use.  Takes several hours to charge but has endurance through entire haircut.  This isn&#x27;t a barber shop quality clipper, but is easy to use and if it lasts for 3 years worth of haircuts it will have paid for itself 10 times over.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> easy to handle, quiet, sharp clean cut, and with one button movement to change the clippers cutting length; Iam allowed to easily style my hair without changing multiple combs.</li>
    <li> The machine is excellent, lightweight, portable, practical and precise, long lasting battery, easy to use and clean, I really like..</li>
    <li> Used it only once and it worked smoothly.</li>
    <li> The attachment adjusts easily to cut hair to various lengths.  This is an excellent hair clipper.</li>
    <li> I have now had this for 2 years, and is still solid.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer.  It&#x27;s very quiet, runs for a long time on a battery charge, and doesn&#x27;t snag my hair.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought these to try cutting my son&#x27;s hair by myself, and they have worked really well.  The cordless option is nice, especially when you are trying to get the hang of cutting hair by yourself and don&#x27;t need a cord getting in the way.  I liked that it had just one attachment to deal with instead of all sorts of detachable combs.  We live in a small apartment and I didn&#x27;t want a big clunky set around taking up more closet space than it was worth.  This was perfect for us.  Simple.  Easy to use.  Seriously, if I can use this well enough to give my son a good looking haircut, anyone can!</li>
    <li> works alright. so I wont give it a bad score. pretty cheap though so it&#x27;s not great if you&#x27;re looking for something nice.</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair and trim it using no attachments, so it is very short.  It works fine and the charge lasts long enough to finish.</li>
    <li> This is special for myself ready to cut machine. With it, I can also hair, need not go to the barber shop, hairdressing apparatus it has scale, it is convenient to use</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. I highly recommend it! Very easy to use. it will be the best product if it had an additional attachment to allow finer trim.</li>
    <li> this machine works as advertised. No bells and whistles. Brought mainly to trim the facial hair. There was no problem in setting up or using.</li>
    <li> Works good for the price I paid.  don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t have different attachable heads.  Hopefully it lasts me a while.</li>
    <li> My son was born with a full head of hair. There was no way I could keep up with baby haircuts at a salon, so I would cut his hair with a pair of shears while he slept. Now that he is a squirmy toddler, I needed to find a hair clipper. This hair clipper is awesome! It is light and easy to use. I love that it is cordless so that I can get the job done, even while chasing after him in the yard.</li>
    <li> This is a nice hair clipper for the price.  The adjustable length comb is convenient; however, I found that sometimes I would accidentally taken it down a notch while using the razor.  It is very convenient that it is cordless and it recharges quickly.  I would recommend this for anyone who likes simple &amp;#34;buzz cuts&amp;#34;  I do not think this would be a good clipper for people looking to do more intricate hair styles such as fades or tapers.</li>
    <li> This will be the last clippers we buy!  it can be charged and run w/o plug,  so its great to use anywhere!  I cut my boys hair outside and no more extension cords for me! a BIG plus for me was no separate attachments.  my last clippers still work, but half the attachments are broken.  This all in one was easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This hair clipper is great for haircuts and sideburn trimming. So far, I&#x27;ve cut my hair with it 5-6 times and it has not clogged or jammed once. It can be used while plugged in or off of its internal rechargeable battery, and the battery seems to last quite long, at least long enough to complete a single haircut (I&#x27;ve never had it die on me while cutting my hair). It&#x27;s relatively quiet (in comparison to other clippers). My only complaint is that the length adjuster is a bit flimsy, and that if pushed to hard, the length could possibly shorten while cutting hair. I haven&#x27;t had that happen to me, but I see how it could be a problem if one wasn&#x27;t being particularly careful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Works great, no jams so far (4-5 haircuts)&lt;br /&gt;2. Price&lt;br /&gt;3. Can be used while plugged into the wall, or on battery&lt;br /&gt;4. Battery life seems sufficient to complete a whole haircut and then some&lt;br /&gt;5. Quiet&lt;br /&gt;6. Small size, relatively portable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Length adjusted is plastic and a bit flimsy&lt;br /&gt;2. Probably not quite as powerful as other hair clippers, but it is plenty sufficient for my needs</li>
    <li> it works but not good</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice design, but the battery life is terrible. I have to keep it plugged in to use it for any normal amount of time. If you don&#x27;t mind always using the charger, then it&#x27;s not bad and pretty quiet.</li>
    <li> So easy to cut. The minimum cut I wish was a closer cut.&lt;br /&gt;One major drawback is you can&#x27;t cut while charging. So if the battery dies mid cut you have to wait for it to recharge. It should instead work while plugged in.</li>
    <li> The best clipper I have ever had.  Easy to adjust.  Sharp cutting and easy to use.  We were pleasantly surprised by how quickly this clipper made cutting hair.  Low noise also makes this perfect for our dog.</li>
    <li> Have used one of these for my beard for years and decided to replace the old one with a new one.  Works even better!  Great trimmer, just don&#x27;t drop it!</li>
    <li> Not sure why I have this into order history don&#x27;t remember ordering these or even yet receiving it?</li>
    <li> Very smooth clipper for a rechargeable one.  Using it time to time now.  I also like the built-in plastic sizer than typical clip-on.  Easy to clean and very quiet.</li>
    <li> I got it mainly due to real cheap price ($7) - was replacing a Remington whose battery was dead. Works well as a beard trimmer. he height adjustment could be better/smoother.</li>
    <li> First off - I notice the price can be all over the place.  I got it for $10 using a $10 coupon at the time, so I&#x27;m comparing it against other $20 clippers.  At this cost I can review it against three other brands that make cheap clipper lines:  Wahl, Conair, and Remington.  My opinion is that this one is hands-down better than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lighter than the others, much quieter, and rechargeable with the ability to use while plugged in (this is key because the rechargeable Remington I had wouldn&#x27;t work while recharging and drove me up the wall!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging seems to work well - I charged it the first day and got three cuts over three weeks before needing a recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts my hair perfectly fine (I don&#x27;t use attachments, so can&#x27;t speak to those).  For the price of a haircut plus tip - I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong.</li>
    <li> easy to use and great for travel. I have had it for only a month and had one charge. Will see how it lasts, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> My first attempt to use this with the guard showed that a flimsy guard will allow my chin to slip in as the guard bends out of the way. This keeps the cut from being uniform and makes it almost useless. The guard is an all-in-one piece and doesn&#x27;t exactly work as an add-on to the device. It is hard to explain but instead of the guard being an adjustment on the device, the device seems to adjust on the guard.</li>
    <li> A good product, easy to use, very smooth, their use is also very convenient, now I can take care of their own hair without having to go to the barber shop.</li>
    <li> WILL PAY OFF COST IN 6 CUTS, I CAN CUT ANY TIME I WANT, CAN TOUCH UP ANY TIME.&lt;br /&gt;I SHOWER RIGHT AFTER CUT, GOOD PRICE, GOOD SELLER.</li>
    <li> Already have used it many times and works great. I like that I don&#x27;t have to change sizes anymore. Good price, good clipper.</li>
    <li> Needed a new pair of clippers for personal grooming. Good to line the hair on your head up with or use em for other areas. Make sure you charge it for the recommended time that it says on the box if your gonna go cordless. Good deal.</li>
    <li> Works well. Would be nice if the battery would last a bit longer for how long you need to charge it. But, at least you can also use ist when plugged in. Overall, it is pretty quiet and cuts well. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> I cut my hair every two weeks, and love how i can go without the cord, and also without saving multiple clips. The single sliding clip for length adjustment works perfectly and no more having a whole bag to save clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big pro- if the battery runs low, this clipper runs full strength on the cord... as opposed to other clippers where you have to wait for the battery to charge. This means you don&#x27;t have to worry about the battery dying in the middle of a haircut (nightmare if you have to wait for the battery to charge)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I although wish it had an adjustment for zero clip... when trimming bare without the clip it pinches and cuts a little... as opposed to my other clippers where you can adjust a little slack so it doestn&#x27; cut skin.</li>
    <li> Works much better than previous slippers i was using.  Cannot compare to other clippers, but do like the removable/adjustable guard.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for long at all and that has been getting progressively worse.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend buying this if you plan to use this for haircuts. The battery does not even last one haircut.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use this clipper to get me through until my next barber shop visit.  I like the adjustable clip instead of swapping out clips for height adjustment.  Very convenient grooming appliance.</li>
    <li> Not good for use. I will not recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> Great goods for the price!</li>
    <li> This is great. Most of the hair trimmers my husband likes have to be charged and can&#x27;t run while plugged in. This removes all the hassle of having to remember to plug in your trimmer the night before wanting to use it, as well as not having to sift through a ton of different sized cutting guides. It trims really smooth too without getting all clogged up, and hardly leaves any stragglers when he trims his hair</li>
    <li> This item works pretty good if you need to cut your own hair.  I keep my hair faily short and this adjusts well for my needs. Once you get the length you like you pretty much leave it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t cut in one pass so I just keep going over my entire head until it isn&#x27;t cutting hair anymore...so it does take a little time to complete your hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be better if there were side taper attachments but for the price I paid, no real complaints.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I found this on slickdeals.net and got it for ~$8 with the Amazon coupon that was being offered at the time. I&#x27;ve used it on my cockapoo puppy and it&#x27;s decent. Definitely doesn&#x27;t cut as cleanly or effectively as a professional but we like our dog&#x27;s fur a little long so it&#x27;s perfect. The battery lasts pretty long and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading reviews from other users. There was another more expensive one, Thankfully, it did meet my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable / removable spacer that they have on this is what I like most about the product. Unlike other clippers (I purchased one before) which have different fitting of for different spacer (the length of hair that you want to spare), this one has a &#x27;slide-able&#x27; spacer, on which you can adjust the length of the hair you want to &#x27;not cut&#x27;. i.e. spacing between the clipper blades and the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Because the spacer is easily removable, you can wash and clean it easily as well (in addition to the small brush that they provide with it for cleaning the blades of the clipper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the clipper thrice now, all three times for trimming my French-cut beard. It was very convenient, comfortable, fast, and effective, also easy to clean. I don&#x27;t know how it would be for trimming hair, but for home-use, for side-burns, beard, etc., I think this is the most suitable clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great design and performance. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I found this Deal @ Gadgetar.com and could not be more happier. Excellent Construction, Awesome Product! Philips makes best shavers, etc.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco should be ashamed of themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair clipper is a perfect example of a simple piece of hardware that functions every bit as it should, but falls short of the fact that you cannot practically change the battery to make the damn thing last. how hard is it to make a battery open/close slot where you&#x27;re able to swap out your own rechargeable battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cuts like it should&lt;br /&gt;light weight&lt;br /&gt;multiple levels of length adjustment&lt;br /&gt;works for wherever you have hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;god aweful battery life&lt;br /&gt;impractically difficult to change the battery for an average person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you change the battery in this thing? yes!. is it practical to do so? NO. is it easy to do so for an average person? NO! in fact it makes the whole process feel stupid knowing the fact that they could very easily make it easily swappable, but no.... they want you to buy a new one. how much land fill, e-waste do we need? it&#x27;s not like we don&#x27;t have enough cell phone in the landfills already. do we really need another piece of hardware that goes to the landfill because you make it so hard for an average person to swap out the battery that they have to buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the battery inside this thing even has markings of AAA on the PCB, with positive and negative terminal next to it. but Philips Norelco chose to solder the terminals to the battery. that&#x27;s right SOLDER. you CAN break the solder with a pair of sharp scissors, or a swiss army knife, after getting past 8 small philips screws and three layers of plastic chasis. you could either swap the batteries with rechargable Nimh or a pair of AAA alkline. but do know that if you go with Alkline, you cannot plug the clipper back into the charger. i went with AAA Alkline because Alkine is all i had lying around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so there you have it. a perfectly fine functionary hardware that&#x27;s not built to last because the maker wants you to buy a new one every year.</li>
    <li> I love this clipper because you can use it without having to oil it.  Worth it for the price.  I used to spend more for just a couple of haircuts than the cost of this alone.</li>
    <li> great hair clipper, very light but with a wide trimmer - use it mostly to shave my head.&lt;br /&gt;love the fact that I can use it worldwide - universal power input (100-240v), current model even has a charge indicator (which does not appear in current photo)&lt;br /&gt;only wish it was a little smaller and came with it&#x27;s own carrying case/bag (that&#x27;s why it gets 4 and not 5 stars) but for the price of 25$ you can&#x27;t get it all</li>
    <li> I finally got a decent trimmer with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;looking at other reviews saying wahl and some others can get closer trims, i was a bit cautious at first, but now i&#x27;m not. it&#x27;s short enough for me so i&#x27;m happy with the result. also the head has all the different trim size settings on it, so you don&#x27;t need to chase down the trim size part like you would a wahl for example, so it simplifies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also worried about some comments about snagging during mid operation. Never happened :} i guess those people with that problem didn&#x27;t charge their trimmers heh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for extras, it doesn&#x27;t have the battery charge indicator to tell you how much charge it has. instead, When you charge it shows a green light to indicate it&#x27;s charging though. the wire charger is also pretty standard, nothing fancy like usb charging, nor does it have a dock either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you can ignore a lack of extras, it&#x27;s a pretty good trimmer for the price :}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for durability i can&#x27;t say, (e.g. battery, motor, razer life expectancy) but it does claim to be a self sharpening razer. Oh yeah, the trim size adjuster part is plastic so it can break, so i wouldn&#x27;t recommend rough handling like throwing it down as it most likely could chip, but then again why would you do that to begin with ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i heard wahls all in one lithium has an issue with it&#x27;s rubber grip making hair stick to it. The philips doesn&#x27;t have this problem. Also the grip seems fine as is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway because it doesn&#x27;t snag, simple to use, light, mobile, has a few trim sizes (short enough to meet my expectations, although i can&#x27;t claim for others, who may want something even shorter size trimming), i rate this 4/5 mostly due to practical usage. it doesn&#x27;t score perfect because of lack of extra features like led battery indicator, usb charging (which would have been more convenient for me), and no dock. Basically the features that the Remington HC5750 has.</li>
    <li> The instruction manual says that it can be used as cordless and corded. However had an instance where it lost battery power during cordless session. Tried using it corded but is has so  weak power when corded that it is practically useless. Stuck with unfinished haircut. It has to be charged again for another 8-10 hours to be used again. I charged for some time before trying to use corded as instructed in the manual but has very weak power, so basically &#x27;cannot be used corded&#x27; especially during urgency. also it is hard to say how much charge is left before starting a haircut. Not happy. Had high hopes from a Philips product. Did not meet expectations.</li>
    <li> This is my first hair clipper; it was very easy to use; good shape to feel easy on the head.&lt;br /&gt;Good options to select the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this :)</li>
