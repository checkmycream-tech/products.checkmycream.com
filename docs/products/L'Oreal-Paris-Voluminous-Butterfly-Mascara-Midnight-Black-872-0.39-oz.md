      <li>I would not recommend this mascara to those looking for a volumizing mascara or are sensitive to perfumes.  </li>
      <li>it gives a natural look and doesn&#x27;t stick my eyelashes together</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got my 71 year old mom and tons of friends using it</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t dry my eyes like other mascaras do.</li>
      <li>Doesn’t dry out quickly and isn’t too wet of a mascara to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
      <li>If you like full and thick lashes</li>

    <li> Horrible !!! Waist of money...&lt;br /&gt;I bought this and tried it out, it made my eyelashes stick together and was super clumpy.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara and I love the way that my eyelashes look after using it. The wand it self is unique, it&#x27;s quite different but it works really well. My only complaint is that by the end of the day this mascara flakes and contributes to the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Does not give me the volume as the other L&#x27;Oreal products.  Going to back to Millionaire by L&#x27;Oreal...super volume!</li>
    <li> I like this formula and plan to stick with it for a while.  The brush allows the mascara to be applied evenly and does a good job at separating lashes.</li>
    <li> This seemed to be dried, possibly old product.</li>
    <li> Love the length on these. Great!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to leave me with black smudges like others I have tried.  I love Loreal Products.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see anything special about this mascara. It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
    <li> I had recently bought IT cosmetics new mascara with fiber technology and was not impressed.  So I saw the reviews for this and figured why not try it at half the cost.  It works better and goes on darker than IT did, which I had to apply 2 coats for the same effect.  I&#x27;ll buy this again and get twice the amount of product for the cost!</li>
    <li> Good. Cheaper here than Walmart...</li>
    <li> LOVE this mascara.  It doesn&#x27;t clump at all.&lt;br /&gt;My first experience with such a funtastic mascara.</li>
    <li> I like L’Oreal’s Voluminous Butterfly Mascara in Midnight Black (washable).  I have very short, sparse, and light colored eyelashes that are hidden behind somewhat thick glasses all day.  My eye makeup is usually a dramatic daywear with a lot of emphasis on the eyes (so you can see them behind my thick, black, plastic frames and thicker lenses).&lt;br /&gt;I am a drugstore make up user as such any comparisons are between this and other drugstore brands.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;• Great, intense dark black color.  I think its color is a lot like L’Oreal’s Carbon Black mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;• I have less flaking with this and other L’Oreal mascaras than I do with CoverGirl and Maybelline (which I used to be a big fan of).&lt;br /&gt;• Can hold a curl from my Revlon curler pretty much all day.&lt;br /&gt;• Gives me great length.&lt;br /&gt;• Doesn’t give me raccoon eyes even during summertime use.&lt;br /&gt;• Wand works really well for me.&lt;br /&gt;• Formula is consistent throughout three months of use.  Doesn’t dry out quickly and isn’t too wet of a mascara to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;• Easy to remove with just water and Cetaphil soap.  (Make up removers and my skin don’t mix well)&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;• Biggest con: The terrible, chemically floral scent.  This scent lingers all day when you wear this product.  It’s like a bad perfume scent, but close to your eyes.  I can get used to it, but it weird and makes you wonder what L’Oreal is putting it in.&lt;br /&gt;• Not much volumizing.  (A little weird that it’s called “Voluminous”).  However, I wasn’t really looking for volumizing so it didn’t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;• Cannot use more than three coats or it clumps.  (All drugstore mascaras do this to me though).&lt;br /&gt;• Wand had a bit of a learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;• During allergy season, I find this irritates my already irritated eyes. (Generally, I just go make up less on really bad allergy days anyways).&lt;br /&gt;To use.  I use the L’Oreal Voluminous Butterfly Mascara I first curl my lashes.  Then I use the non-flared side of the mascara wand to coat my lashes on both eyes.  Then, I go back (this prevents clumps) and use the flared side to comb through my lashes, wiggling it slightly.  This separating them for a fanned look while also lengthening them.  Sometimes, I use the point of the brush to help get in the corners.  For my bottom lashes, I first use the non-flared side and then use the point to define them (mine tend to lay flat and this seems to curl them).  This works really well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I would say there is a good chance I will probably buy L’Oreal Voluminous Butterfly Mascara again.  The color is great and this works well to make my lashes look like them exist and holds a curl.  I would not recommend this mascara to those looking for a volumizing mascara or are sensitive to perfumes.  I downgraded this mascara a star because the smell.</li>
    <li> Nice mascara....great price.</li>
    <li> its a great mascara, leaves lashes nice and soft</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara. I have naturally long eyelashes, and this is one of the only mascaras I&#x27;ve ever tried that won&#x27;t clump my lashes together. I&#x27;ve gotten asked several times since wearing this mascara if I wear fake eyelashes! I&#x27;ll definitely continue using it.</li>
    <li> I wish I had bought this mascara sooner!!  I don&#x27;t wear fake lashes, so I really need a mascara that will make my lashes pop.  Lo&#x27;real makes quality mascara to begin with.  This one will quicky lengthen and thicken your lashes.  If you like full and thick lashes this is the mascara for you. If you want your lashes thicker just apply a bit more coats, not to many or clumping will occur.  Your eyes will be that  much prettier.  No chipping, flaking, just all day wear.  At night I dread washing it off.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. It is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t dry my eyes like other mascaras do. it gives a natural look and doesn&#x27;t stick my eyelashes together</li>
    <li> It is OK, nothing very special.</li>
    <li> The brush for this is fantastic and the product is great. I get almost no clumps and the formula lasts me all day without running. This made my lashes look fake. Bought 2 more for my sister and mom and I&#x27;ll be buying this again for myself.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair, which seems to equate to fine eyelashes and eyebrows, too. I use a primer under this because of that. Good application thickness and doesn&#x27;t get all smeary. Removes fairly easily.</li>
    <li> I have been telling everyone about this product.  I.  Am.  In. Love.  It&#x27;s the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used in my life.  My lashes are gorgeous.  I&#x27;ve got my 71 year old mom and tons of friends using it and everyone loves it.</li>
    <li> The best Mascara I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara best one yet and at a great price.</li>
    <li> This mascara is the best for me. I use the waterproof one since I curl my stick straight lashes. The butterfly mascara holds my curl ALL DAY. It lengthens my lashes and doesn&#x27;t clump up for me at all. Yes.</li>
    <li> Great this works really well.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. I especially love the winged edges of the wand, which are perfect for getting those little eyelashes in the corners of my eyes.</li>
