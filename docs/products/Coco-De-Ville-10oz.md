<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This lotion is amazing! It smells wonderful, it doesn&#x27;t streak at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to take a thing of baby wipes with me for my hands or use gloves so that I don&#x27;t get yellow/orange on my hands but that is all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I used this lotion last year. It is fabulous, I would be purchasing it again except I am lotion obsessed and there are just too many to try, I cannot use the same one twice. It smells heavenly and goes on smooth. It has a good amount of DHA in it however, I never noticed any streaking or orange color.  It is a always a good idea to get a base tan using a lotion with \\&quot;natural bronzers\\&quot; or no bronzers before jumping into a lotion with DHA bronzer. The DHA is strong enough to give you a hint of \\&quot;after tanning bed\\&quot; scent but there is not a lotion out there with DHA that does not do this. It will tint your hands eventually so bring a baby wipe!</li>
    <li> I thought this lotion was going to be awesome, since EVERYONE in my salon is talking about it. But honestly I got super orange and streaky!!! I washed my hands right after, like I always do but yet I still got orange!! Yes the color was decent, but honestly it just looked fake. So if you&#x27;re going for a \\&quot;Jersey Shore\\&quot; fake tan look this is your stuff!! But if you want something more natural look else where, like DS Rue La La which has all natural tanners, NO BRONZERS!!</li>
    <li> Having worked in the tanning industry since my teenage years; Ive used TONS of different lotions &amp; always found Designer Skin to be a favorite amongst myself &amp; tanning customers. This is another great product- as I&#x27;ve come to expect with Designer Skin. This is incredibly mosturizing, a great bronzer (rub in carefully &amp; spray off your hands), &amp; the coconut smell is awesome. I will likely re-purchase on this product when it runs out!</li>
    <li> i used luminary last year. so i ended up picking this lotion for the 2012 year because i was told it was edible. I still am not sure if that is true. NEGATIVES : So as for the smell (i love smells) I AM SO UNIMPRESSED! It smells like tanning lotion and that is exactly the problem. It does not smell fruity, perfumey, or flowery. Just the smells of tanning lotion not even the coconuty kind. I do not like it. It also stains your hands orange quick. That is exactly what i was trying to avoid. I took one star off for those 2 negatives. POSITIVE: i have used many lotions and this one gave me color faster than any others. I also love the packaging. The size is great and it fits in my purse. This is a 3 or 4 star lotion. I would not repurchase. My favorite tanning lotion from Designer Skin ever is believe!</li>
    <li> it smells great, I get no ATO with it or dha smell and the lotion is like applying self tanner after I get out of the bed its amazing how dark it makes me. I always make sure to wash my hands after tanning though to ensure I dont get orange palms.</li>
    <li> It has a strong beach scent (coconut &amp; pineapple) that stays with you throughout the day. It feels like silicon with a good hydration. The instant deep bronzing color is very apparent even after the first use. I got a great color</li>
    <li> I just purchased this tanning lotion and got it in the mail a few days ago. There were no reviews so I had nothing to go off of, so I figured I should write one! The smell is awesome, it smells like a beach! I really like it and it made me super dark super fast, but the fake tanner is a little much. I usually love the designer skin with bronzers, but this one made my hands literally orange. And they look horrible. I wish it didn&#x27;t have so much because I would love it if it didn&#x27;t turn my hands orange! I guess I&#x27;ll just be washing my hands after I use it for now on. It&#x27;s just a pain cause there&#x27;s not really a sink in the tanning place I go to.. But other than that I love it! Just watch out for the orange hands!</li>
    <li> I tried a packet of this because I usually love DS. I already have a nice base tan (which I got from a very cheap lotion). This left me ORANGE in patches and got all over my clothes after I tanned! Then the next morning I had blotchy color where it had rubbed off - now I look like I have a skin condition. Walmart&#x27;s Dark Star 40x for 8.00 works better than this stuff. UGH!! YUCK!! YUCK!!</li>
    <li> Smell: AMAZING!  Coconut-like.  Delicious.  Don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling gross after tanning.  And (oddly enough, don&#x27;t ask) it tastes good, too.  Self-tanner is a little too much.  It&#x27;s a little streaky if not rubbed in properly, and slightly orange.  I would HIGHLY recommend that you have a good base tan prior to using this, or you&#x27;re going to end up streaked and unhappy.  It did get me noticeably darker in 24 hours.  I love it.  I used Ravish Me prior to using this.  I think I like this slightly more than the Ravish Me (LOVE the smell WAYYYY more) and it did get me slightly darker.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I have been tanning indoors for about a year now and have been experimenting with different lotions to see what works best for me. This product, Coco De Ville by Designer Skin, gives me a great golden bronze color!! I can tell there is a lot of \\&quot;self-tanner\\&quot; (or what ever causes the orangish-color) but, since my skin is considered to be naturally medium in skin tone, the color blends very well!! I would NOT recommend this lotion for any light or fair complected skin types, (or anyone just beginning to tan indoors) as it will probably make you look bright orange! I like that this product has self-tanner because I can tan less, but keep the same dark color. The crushed pineapple scent is strong (almost overpowering), but pleasantly tropical... The biggest downside, however, would be that this lotion leaves a thin greasy residue on the body afterwards. I usually wipe off the excess lotion after tanning, and within an hour, my skin absorbs the rest.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m already pretty dark and I was excited to try this. The smell is awesome, a nice coconut smell. The result of using this though is a nightmare. I&#x27;m dark and it STILL made me orange. No streaks, but flat out ORANGE. It was ridiculous and pissed me off that I paid 10 bucks for a sample packet of it. Terrible stuff. I expected better from Designer Skin. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Just because DS and the salon chooses to hike the price of this stuff up doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better than cheaper options. I have better results with DS&#x27;s Label Me Beautiful or Pretty and Reckless, neither of which cost as much as this crap.</li>
    <li> I have purchased samples of Coco De Ville at tanning salons and was impressed, so I figured I would purchase a full sized bottle. This seller clearly waters down their product... the lotion is so liquidly and barely sticks to the skin. The sample packets that I have previously purchased (not from this seller) have been thicker lotion and left a pleasant scent even after tanning. I suggest not wasting your money on this product like I did.</li>
    <li> Very,very Nice!Great Item&#x3D;Great Seller+Fast Shipping+Great Communication.Thank U</li>
    <li> I have used this for 2 months it has gotten me so bronze so fast. 1 thing you need to wipe between your fingers &amp; palms they will turn orange..If wiped all Good!!! I recommend this product to all.You smell great after you tan!!! Plus is has a nice taste</li>
    <li> Just used this lotion for the first time yesterday- it gave quick results but be careful- my hands are orange and there are very visible streaks on my arms.. this is after ONE use, 10 min in the tanning bed. if you&#x27;re looking for really fast color (if a bit unnatural looking..) then this is for you, but be very careful to apply evenly to avoid streaking and be sure to wash your hands right away.  It does smell really good! but I will be switching back to Love Junkie after this bad experience.</li>
    <li> This is a thicker darker bronzer for a great mid summer glow. Has a wonderful coconut beach smell and makes you feel like your on vacation.</li>
    <li> I usually use tingles because they are will get you the darkest but I like to rotate out once in a while. I was really impressed with this. I has a lovely smell and it tastes great too, which is kind of fun if you have someone to taste it :)&lt;br /&gt;The color is really great. Bronzers work differently on everyone&#x27;s skin tone, this one was great on mine!</li>
    <li> smells great, taste great, weird i know but very streaky!!!! and a day after use i started itching under the skin bad for about 3 days like an uncontrolable itch i couldnt scrach!!! wont be useing this again</li>
    <li> I just bought this lotion and it smells great and works great.  Some reviews said it turned them orange but i didnt have that problem.  It is a great bronzer and i would higly recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> Love it. I skyped with my man the other night. He said \\&quot;damn you as lookin&#x27; bronze! Sexy sexy! You gone tanning?\\&quot; I was like \\&quot;yeah I went this morning\\&quot;. I love this lotion.</li>
    <li> Smells great, love the feel on my skin.  The bronzers are great.&lt;br /&gt;Really helps the tan.  I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Lotion smells really bad, not anything I would order again.  Smells even worse than self tanning sprays I have used.</li>
    <li> Smells great and definitely gives a deep golden tan. You should have a good base tan before using bease this does not do well on fair skin. Turns orange and will leave your hands orange for days no matter what you do to avoid it or take care care of it.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion. The price here is also a fraction of the price they charge in tanning places, and comes new in the package!</li>
    <li> Love this! The bronzing is awesome and the smell is so heavenly. It will stain your hands so make sure you wash them! But I will definitely be a loyal customer from now on</li>
    <li> This lotion smells really good which comes in handy if you have things to do after tanning. I expected more color after a few uses but overall its just as good as australian gold or swedish beauty . If I would have paid the $70 they were asking at my salon I might have felt a little ripped off, but for the price I paid here I would buy it again. The shipping was super fast I ordered a lotion at the same time and paid extra for the shipping and I am still waiting on that to come, its been a week. Overall I am pleased</li>
    <li> Not only does this smell great it also has anti wrinkle solution, awesome for me.</li>
    <li> I love Coco De Ville!!! I only use it when I go to the tanning salon and I think it&#x27;s amazing!!! I have NEVER had results like this and in such a short time. I just read a review saying it made the person have streaks, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it at all. Obviously my skin is different,  but I love it!! Going to buy more!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff and SUPER cheap!! I would and will order more of this when I run out!!! Very very happy</li>
    <li> I love Designer Skin products.. Coco de Ville is one of the best. It gives you a  beautiful  lasting tan.</li>
    <li> I would not use this if you do not have a base tan! This will turn you orange and may even streak. IT HAS A SELF TANNING BRONZER!!! If you have a base tan I would say use this if you want extra color. Make sure that you take wipes with you when you use this because if you do not wipe your hands off after putting this on your hands will turn! I really like this stuff I have used it several times. I am golden brown and and this will give me an extra boost when i need it.</li>
    <li> The lotion doesn&#x27;t break out my skin and it smells great too ! It smells like a mixture of pineapples and coconuts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous sun tanning lotions and this one gives me a beautiful brown color and smells amazing! It smells so good I typically leave it on all day! This is rare to find in a tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> The color from this lotion is just average-  a light golden color. I prefer a deep, dark brown, therefore this was insufficient for me. Also, my skin reacted poorly and was itchy: (</li>
    <li> Great tanning lotion and cheaper from amazon versus salon</li>
    <li> Works great. Scent is a little off for my taste</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion last Friday from my tanning salon. I openly asked her is this lotion going to turn me orange? She replied oh no! I wouldn&#x27;t sell you something that is going to turn you orange. Boy did she lie! I am very upset with this lotion, I totally wasted my money and bad thing is I paid tanning salon price. Since I purchased this I have complained twice but the girl that sold it to me hasn&#x27;t been there for me to talk to. I think this lotion would be terrific IF.... IT DIDN&#x27;T TURN MY HANDS ORANGE!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the color it gave me, definitely lots of bronzers but didn&#x27;t make me orange. Have to wipe off your hands real good after applying though.  It was the smell that got to me. It smells great going on but that after tan odor is horrible! I felt like I could smell it even after I showered.</li>
    <li> Makes your streaky and orange !! Also stains all over your hands !</li>
    <li> I found this and said wow, cause I had just been in a tanning salon and the cost was double there, I was so happy to find this, it smells great and works well, I am fair skin and needed a self tanning to be in my lotion. This is a great deal all around.</li>
    <li> Great for events! I was in a wedding and needed color fast! I used it twice and got the results I was looking for! Smells great, great shipping and great pricing! Couldn&#x27;t want more :)</li>
    <li> i absolutely LOVE this lotion! i am immediately dark after using this lotion. you smell like a tropical island with a piña colada in hand. extremely happy with this lotion purchase. i&#x27;m so sad mine is almost gone.. gotta buy another bottle! :)</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase of Coco De Ville and I love the way it is so easy to apply and it makes my skin smell great and smooth. My daughter sent me my  first bottle to try and then I was a believer.</li>
    <li> Went to tanning yesterday and used the Coco De Ville. I really like it, and then a surprise!!! Got home and my husband comment that I was smelling really good. After a kiss on my shoulders... I was tasting amazingly.  :)  And.....  You should try!</li>
    <li> This lotion has a super amazing beachy smell that smells great before &amp; after tanning. I say this is a great DARK bronzer because I don&#x27;t recommend it to people who don&#x27;t already have a good base tan. The bronzers are DARK!!!!! If you use it without a base tan it will look very orange!! But over an already apparent tan, the results are a deep golden bronze!! I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this tanning lotion for about a month now and I just love it!! It has a great smell and last for a long time after you tan. I will buy this tanning lotion again! You do have to make sure you wipe your hands after you apply lotion...great tip use BABY WIPES! My tanning salon provides them but, just grab a travel size at any store and wipe your hands after you apply your lotion! I do every time and havent had orange hands yet :)</li>
    <li> I used this on a Wednesday, purchased a UVA visit, tanned for 12 min&#x27;s. (Hadn&#x27;t tanned in over a month) I have olive skin and tan well, with &amp; without lotion. This lotion gave me the fastest, best boost, for my money I&#x27;ve ever spent. It was perfect for my (xoxo) Friday night with my hubb&#x27;s. Seriously, it was an instant tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: I made the mistake of not cleaning my palms. (Even though it clearly says to do this on the back of the bottle), the girls at the salon didn&#x27;t tell me I should. First timer with bronzer :/ I didn&#x27;t get the \\&quot;pleasant smell\\&quot; others have raved about in their reviews. Honestly, I smelled like a corncob lol. I did itch after a couple of days, but I attributed that to the tan and not the lotion. However, it could be from either, I suppose. It was not enough to discourage me from using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this lotion! I applied it very liberally and evenly, no streaks. No orange color either. I was more gold, but again, I have a natural olive undertone. I WILL be wiping my hands next time I use it!</li>
    <li> This lotion smells good and it makes u really dark. I has a ton of bronzers in it and gives a golden brown tan. After the first use i was a few shades darker than before. Be sure to rub it in evenly.</li>
    <li> This product gets you tan and smells really great, but has so many bronzers in it that it leave orange streaks that look like you use fake tanner. I wipe my hands really well before and after using the tanning bed and wash my hands when I get home, but my palms and fingers still look orange. My ankles even look orange after using this if I don&#x27;t rub it in well before tanning. Also the plastic cap in the opening of the bottle always pops out so it gets really messy. It&#x27;s disappointing because it&#x27;s a really expensive lotion, but I&#x27;ve had less expensive ones get me more tan without the fake tan look. Thankfully my bottle is almost gone and I won&#x27;t be buying this one again. And I&#x27;m definitely buying all my tanning lotion from Amazon from now on, it&#x27;s ridiculous how expensive they can be at the salons.</li>
    <li> First... this smells incredible... like a heavenly beach vacation.  It smooths the skin nicely.. doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or oily residue.  It leaves a definite bronzing on your skin so apply it evenly.  It helps if you already have a base tan so this looks natural.  Also... moisturize your hands prior to applying lotion and wash your hands as soon as possible after tanning.  I am a nurse so I wash my hands constantly... my hands aren&#x27;t super moisturized at all times and I noticed a tanning line from the lotion between my fingers... but I think that could easily be fixed by applying lotion before tanning.  No other spots were noticed after use.  I will definitely go back and buy more of this product!</li>
    <li> This lotion is good if u already have a good base tan. The smell is delecious and it will give you a gorgeous pecan tan. I am on my 3rd bottle of this. I used to use tingle to get the richer brown color but not anymore. If you are pale this will still work but use in small amounts at first and smear on skin evenly. I always wear disposable gloves with any bronzed lotion. The smell is yummy and u will smell like you&#x27;ve been on the beach all day. The lotion also leaves your skin silky smooth. This stuff is awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> So much less expensive than buying this product in the tanning salon! It is the exact same thing and works great! I am very pale and after just one tanning session I have some nice color. Be sure to wash your hands immediately following a tan, or they will turn brown. It does not streak like some other tanning lotions I&#x27;ve used, highly recommend if you want some self tanner in your product!</li>
    <li> Works indoor, outdoor, and it is kissable.  Love the bronze color it gives me! Would buy it again.. but then again I already have too many lotions.</li>
    <li> I absoutely love the smell of this lotion and it doesn&#x27;t taste too bad either!&lt;br /&gt;A little of this goes a long way so I would be conservative with the application.. I got too much on and it got a little sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It defiantely gives instant color due to the DHA in it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it every day though.. I used it for about 3 days in a row and noticed that I was turning a little orange. I recommend using it a couple days a week, alternating it with a bronzer without DHA to keep your color going!</li>
    <li> Works well. Very orange though its like a liquid spray tan almost and if you don&#x27;t was your hands right away it will turn them like bright orange.&lt;br /&gt;Very thin for lotion.</li>
    <li> The scent is just way too strong and honestly..it&#x27;s kind of nasty. I don&#x27;t like the fact that it has a taste to it either. I have an 11 month old and the first time I used this he was goofing off and put his mouth on my arm..........then he wouldn&#x27;t take it off. Lmao. Smh. Yeah not a fan of the fact that this has a taste to it. I can&#x27;t really judge on how well it bronzes because I don&#x27;t use it. Wish I never bought. Go with Luminary instead!</li>
    <li> I ordered this last week and I had just received it in the mail today. The bottle came packaged and had no damage. The lotion smells good and leaves me smelling like piña colada. I licked my skin to see if it taste like that too because of the reviews I&#x27;ve read on here which it did. I have only used it this one day so I can&#x27;t really write about how well it works. The only reason this stuff is given one star is because I wonder if it&#x27;s fake, watered down, or is real and suppose to have a watery like consistency (normally designer skin products I&#x27;ve used have not). I&#x27;ve read another review on here about the lotion they received also being water like consistency. I&#x27;ll update my review in a week or so and write if the lotion works or not and if so how well.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product! It smells like coconut. However, compared with lotions that have silicone in them, this product is very runny. I have to be careful not to spill it when I use it. I also advise being very careful when applying this product. You have to make sure to rub it on evenly and well. It is VERY obvious when you miss a spot with the lotion, as the bronzers are very, very dark. This product is not for those without a base tan! I&#x27;ve had a problem with the lotion making me look orange around my wrists and hands even after using baby wipes to clean my hands directly after applying the lotion (before even using the tanning bed!). I recommend keeping your hands extremely moisturized before using the lotion and being hydrated to avoid absorbing the lotion into your hands. I&#x27;m not sure I prefer the color it makes your skin look either. It works and gets the job done, but it&#x27;s not my favorite. I suppose the biggest plus is that it smells pleasant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now. I prefer something that has a silicon base, but it&#x27;s not too bad. Hours after tanning I still don&#x27;t have that burnt flesh smell....always a plus.</li>
    <li> I know some of the earlier reviewers love the smell of this lotion but I find it nice before you tan but funky and lingering and sticky afterwards. Leaves you streaky as well. I own a salon so I&#x27;ve noticed that it does turn orangey on some people as well. Snookie purple is soooo much better!</li>
    <li> Good value &amp; smells nice.</li>
    <li> I loved this stuff when I was first applying it. It smells super tropical and yummy, and it seems to be very hydrating. But after tanning I noticed the bronzer was a bit too strong (even for me) and it smelled bad.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t buy again, some do like the instant tan results but it isn&#x27;t natural looking enough for me!</li>
    <li> great product... Not greasy and gives a great tan</li>
    <li> This lotion smells amazinggggg, works super well, layed out on the beach for a long while and I got so tan! I&#x27;m kind of fair skinned with a nice tan, but this got me a couple shades darker in the first use. Shipper was awesome and received it when it was supposed to be:)</li>
    <li> I am addicted to tanning lotion, I usually use tingle but I needed a good non tingle bronzer&lt;br /&gt;to use before work, so I decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;first off it smells sooo good but has a bit of ato after a fee hours&lt;br /&gt;as for taste (thats just weird) but it does have a good taste&lt;br /&gt;color is DARK and beautiful, but if you dont already have a good dark base tan you are going to be orange&lt;br /&gt;so I would NOT recommend this so a light skinned person!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and will be buying again when I run out!</li>
    <li> It was a gift for someone but they love this product.  The gift was late by 2 days for the birthday but arrived on the day they said it would.  It smells fantastic and wouldn&#x27;t mind to try it myself</li>
    <li> I purchased a sample of this tanning lotion at my tanning salon because I wanted to switch up my lotion to something that smelled better. This lotion smells AWESOME - just like the beach (vanilla/coconut). It can be used both for indoor and outdoor tanning. A lot of the reviews mention streaking and turning your hands orange. You can avoid all of that IF you have a base tan already. I&#x27;ve been tanning for several months now and am noticeable dark, and when I used this lotion I noticed a difference immediately after. I normally shower hours after I tan to let it set in, and even after I showered I was still darker. Not to mention I didn&#x27;t smell like burnt flesh afterwards, I smelled like beach! :) Tip to try if you don&#x27;t want orange hands: Most tanning salons place a towel in your tanning bed after they&#x27;ve sanitized it - use the towel to clean your hands immediately after applying lotion. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with orange hands by doing this. Overall, lotion smells amazing and works really well. I will be purchasing the 10oz bottle.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion alot, it smells good and gives me the nice color i&#x27;m looking for (not orange!), I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> i work at a salon and purchased this lotion, definately will get you dark! the dha (delayed bronzers) take about three hours to see the full results, def worked the best for me! overall it did give me the dark color i was looking for, the after odar i didnt care for, but def one of my favorites for instant color!</li>
