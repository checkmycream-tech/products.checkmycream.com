<li> I do love this puff; it adheres the powder well without removing the mineral foundation and blush base layers I have on before the lighter translucent powder</li>
<li> The video also explains just why you need this puff and why it is suggested that you do not use a brush as it will mess up the work you&#x27;ve done with foundation or tinted</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product was extremely disappointing. It was grossly misrepresented when the size was not stated and then when the company charged an amount that no person in their right mind would pay.  My husband &amp; I thought that the puff size was sufficient for a persons body, not just their face because the cost was $12.00 when all other competitors prices were around $4. There was also a review on the internet stating that the Laura Mercier&#x27;s product was so much bigger than a competitor&#x27;s, much more suitable for a body not just for the face.  But to our surprise, we received an 8\\&quot; square box by 4\\&quot; deep with a crappy little 3\\&quot; round face Puff that cost $12 + $5.95 shipping + tax totaling 18.67!!!!                                                 Furious,  Laurie &amp; Dave Cruikshank</li>
    <li> This puff is so good! You can make a natural face with that. It is little bit expensive but it is woryhy.</li>
    <li> Just like her sponges, this puff lasts, feels great and is machine (yes, machine) washable.</li>
    <li> I have just finished washing this puff for about the 20th time.  I hand wash and then fluff it back up by putting it in the dryer for about 1 minute.  I was very surprised at how long it has lasted.....note......I got this puff over a year ago.  It is great for applying loose powder.  It leaves just the right amount on your face, you don&#x27;t end up with that chalky overdone look.  I love that the puff releases your powder with just a light touch.  The way it applies the powder you never have to worry with smudging your blush etc.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the money. I have been using this for a couple of months and have had no problems with. Was nervous the first time I washed it in the washing machine, but it came out like new.</li>
    <li> Purchased this puff for my mom.  She had been looking everywhere for a good quality powder puff (not a throw-away).  She couldn&#x27;t believe I found one.  She thought they didn&#x27;t make them anymore.  She&#x27;s very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Perfect make up puffs. I love that they can be washed. They are the best. Great transaction, smooth, fast and easy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s excellent but really too expensive.  However, it is washable and does last a long time.  Four more words/words required.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice, high quality cosmetic puff.  I use this daily to roll on my pressed powder.  The size is a bit larger than your average pressed powder container, making it nice and large and easy to handle. The back has a ribbon that says \\&quot;Laura Mercier\\&quot; so that you can easily slide fingers through to help with easy application. I will likely buy this powder puff again in the future when it&#x27;s time to replace.</li>
    <li> pretty expensive for a puff.</li>
    <li> My wife found this on Amazon along with the Laura Mercier loose powder she can no longer get at our local retailers. She said to give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> What a difference a good Velour Puff makes, will not be going back to the cheaper kind.  This puff makes whatever I am using to go on like a dream, be sure to press the product on the puff onto your face.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my mom and she says that they&#x27;re soft and they work very well. (: I recommend buying them if you want good powder puffs. (:</li>
    <li> This large, soft puff is perfect for applying my Laura Mercier transluscent setting powder and Ben Nye Bananna powder. I have only used it a few times and haven&#x27;t washed it yet but the quality seems great. Would definitaly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have looked for the right size puff for my face powder and this is it.  I do not like brushes for applying my face powder and most puffs are too small and stiff.  Love it! This is my second purchase</li>
    <li> Looking for a powder puff about 5 inches in circumference to apply baby powder. This one looked bigger on the internet.</li>
    <li> I prefer using a powder brush rather than a powder puff.</li>
    <li> I do love this puff; it adheres the powder well without removing the mineral foundation and blush base layers I have on before the lighter translucent powder</li>
    <li> This puff is very large and is simply great.. Hand insert allows me to pat my powder on with ease... I need another one!!! Highly recommended..</li>
    <li> It was a great puff it was larger then what i thought it was going to be. I will def. get again.</li>
    <li> Its quality is just ok. When I compared a puff I bought from this seller to the one in Sephora store, my puff is actually a few centimeters smaller in diameter. Not sure if it&#x27;s an authentic one. However, the puff got the job done alright.</li>
    <li> Too big for powder container.</li>
    <li> I bought this puff to use with another amazon product: Laura Mercier Mineral Illuminating Powder. This is a nice-sized puff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a tutorial to properly use this puff. Try folding it into a U shape and rolling it on the face. The video also explains just why you need this puff and why it is suggested that you do not use a brush as it will mess up the work you&#x27;ve done with foundation or tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice puff!</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Washes up great</li>
    <li> Extremely overpriced for the quality--small and thin--but it is okay.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. A must have.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I was looking for a well made puff for the body. It is well made but way to small. I read. One of the reviews saying they use it for their body. Will keep it until I can find. A larger one.</li>
    <li> It does not work.  It is not &amp;#34;all that&amp;#34; as it was chalked up to be.  I much prefer a brush.&lt;br /&gt;Marian</li>
    <li> These are nice. &#x60;Think the are filled with foam or simuliar material? I do prefer all velour or a cotton filling, myself.  I change them, monthly.....about.</li>
