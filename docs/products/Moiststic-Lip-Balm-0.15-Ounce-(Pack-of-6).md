    <li> Not only does this chap stick HEAL your lips, it tastes good, moistens them and feels great on.  Some other chap sticks dry your lips out and you become dependent on them, this does NOT!  Your lips will thank you!</li>
    <li> Best lip balm ever made.</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing with pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I have tried many brands but this is by far better than any other chap stick I have tried. When my lips are very chapped I can feel it healing them.</li>
    <li> Best lip bam around, period. Contains lanolin it so it actually heals your lips, doesn&#x27;t just cover them like petroleum or all-beeswax balms. I even use it on my nose when it gets chapped from blowing it when I have a cold.</li>
    <li> My knuckles and certain other finger areas tend to split during winter.  Just a spot treatment heals like nothing I&#x27;ve used before.  This also softens scabbed areas of minor cuts and wounds.  After the initial healing period, once a cut is well past the possibility of infection, hard scabs can be just an annoyance.  Dabbing a bit of this actually helps dissolve the scab.</li>
    <li> Other than the homemade lip balm my daughter makes, this is the only lip balm I will use. I originally bought it at our local health food store and it was about a dollar more than on Amazon. Great product, protects lips and feels great.</li>
    <li> Used it for three years. Excellent product. Will continue using it. Very soothing and refreshing. I will recommend it def9nitely.</li>
    <li> Love the peppermint extract and all natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I use this on my dogs butt after he  drags it across the carpet he loves it.</li>
    <li> BEST EVER lip moisturizer!!. I live in a very arid climate, lips are always dry. I use this lip Balm and my lips feel moist and soft within seconds. Love this product. Been using this product for years.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Glides on well, and doesn&#x27;t wear off right away.  A stick lasts for ages and the tea tree gives a bit of a tingle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, and this is the one.  The tea tree oil amps up this healing formula.  My husband works outside and needs the protection and this is the only lip balm he&#x27;ll use.  I made sure that we&#x27;re never out of stock!</li>
    <li> Three of us in our family (2 of them guys) have tried MoistStic, and we all really like it.  It glides on smoothly, has a refreshing tingle and light scent.  Much better than those sticky or waxy lip products.  Will probably order more to have on hand.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm! All natural with tea tree and peppermint oil. Non greasy and just right light tingle!</li>
    <li> My lips always are dry in my high desert area. But this product is a big help in preventing split lips. I carry it in my purse, and in my car.</li>
    <li> As a life long lip balm addict, I have finally found the only lip balm I will ever need.  This lip balm is moisturizing as the name suggests, without feeling sticky on your lips. An added bonus to this lip balm is that my husband can keep a tube of it in his pants pocket all day and not have it melt.  We have been using this product for about 10 years now and are beyond happy with it.  This is a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> There is no lip balm on the market that compares to MoiStic.  I found it about 12 years ago and have used it ever since. It goes on easy, gives great coverage, and truly is moist with a nice flavor.</li>
    <li> The quest to find the best lip balm ever is over!  Be mindful that when applied, your lips will feel like they have taken a vacay.  The best thing about this is the tea tree oil which leaves my lips tingly, soft and like an arctic breeze blew passed...LOL</li>
    <li> Moist Stik is my favorite lip balm. I would use it all day every day, but it doesn&#x27;t have a sunscreen in it so I only use it at night. It&#x27;s very moistening (doesn&#x27;t just cover dry lips with a waxy layer) and stays on for a long time. I first found it at Fred Meyer in Seattle but can&#x27;t find it in stores now that I&#x27;m back in CA. Thank you for carrying it, Amazon!</li>
