<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the cologne i received was def. fake as hell. the smell wore off after about an hour of putting it on. i would not recommend this to anyone. WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
    <li> Ive been a fan of Bvlgari for quite some time but i stuck with their classics for a while. Thought id buy this one and try it out. I dont know why i didnt buy it earlier. It is amazing. Starts with a citrus hint but turns into arabian musk within a minute or two and lasts for atleast 12 hours. Ive been getting a lot of compliments lately.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast - hubby loves this fragrance - it is the real deal! yummy</li>
    <li> this is a good perfume for the most part and the price was perfect especially considering thisis a 3.4 oz bottle. however the smell is very mild, need to spray a lot more if you need to create an aura.</li>
    <li> It was delivered within 3 days since I ordered the items. Its size is quite enough to use for few years.   I gave three Bvlgaris to my fellows. They would like it. I was glad to buy this item.</li>
    <li> I have never been complemented on any one single thing more than I have been complemented on how good this stuff smells.</li>
    <li> I purchased it after reading other reviews, I got the product, was very happy with the packing and the bootle. However I used it, it did not feel like a perfume. There was no perfume like fragrance in it. However I tried to give it a try to use as a car perfume, so broke the bottleneck and tried to pour it into my car perfume holder. During the process, a little got spilled onto my car dashboard, and what I found that it started removing the dashboard color immediately. What I can see, this could be a very good nail polish remover and smells like one also. But then I am not sure that I should be paying that much price for a nail polish remover in a wrong packing! I am giving it one star for the nice packing though.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents!</li>
    <li> My husband simply loves this fragrance. It has a clean masculine smell. This is one of the best fragrances sold for men!</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne for my son for Christmas. Cologne was great and well packaged. The price was incredible. Now for my husband!</li>
    <li> Love the smell , get a lot of compliment when wearing product .... have a very modern and lasting smell will buy a couple bottle before marker stop making product ..... Great smell ..... Thanks</li>
    <li> Good smell, but doesn&#x27;t amazed me when I wear it. It&#x27;s a good day-time perfume.</li>
    <li> This smells so wonderful on my husband.  We both love the Bvlgari brand since we first bought it a few years ago.  The men and women&#x27;s scents are fabulous.</li>
    <li> I bought this without knowing what it was like. I don&#x27;t regret buying it at all, in fact I liked this stuff as soon as I tried it, and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great, and it lasts a long time, depending on how much, and where.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reccomend spraying it on sweaters, hoodies, jackets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend loves the smell of it and has named it the Kyle Smell (My name).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great cologne.</li>
    <li> This is a pleasing scent that will have broad appeal.  I would describe it as floral with spicy overtones.  A solid choice to add to your collection.  On Amazon, surprisingly affordable.  I never had any problem with fragrances on Amazon being \\&quot;weak\\&quot; or \\&quot;counterfeit.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it and it is not permanent. I bought it just because it is permanent. But, I have noticed that it is not.</li>
    <li> I received a tester of this stuff and with all the reviews saying it&#x27;s awesome you would think it would be.  This stuff in all honesty smells like a dog with flea killer on it.  I hate to bash a cologne because I thought this one would smell good but I was wrong.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me but the stuff really is nasty.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne, it&#x27;s the balance between the strong and the soft ones, it&#x27;s really nice, when you wear it women will be asking which one has it, they love the smell...i love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit light for my taste but i gave it to my son who really likes it. It has a soft powdery smell which is not unpleasant and not enduring.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne for my boyfriend as a birthday gift and he loved it. It is also a good price here on amazon. I looked for it at other places and it was way more expensive other places.</li>
    <li> LATEST UPDATE : Amazon LLC contacted me this afternoon and are going to further investigate their Perfume Batches and the suppliers and know of this situation already. They have refunded my purchance in full + taxes.&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products sold by Amazon Blvgari Blv Notte By Bvlgari For Men are knock- offs and i am very surprised that they are being sold openly by Amazon LLC.&lt;br /&gt;The product that i own is a very good example of this. This is the second time it has happened since my last 2 purchases. My Bottle has bubbles in it on arrival and no scent at all. Seems someone just poured blue water in the bottle sealed it and shipped it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Corporate office of BLVGARI @ Address: 625 Madison Ave, New York, NY 10022, Phone:(800) 285-4274 only to hear that they are aware of it and cannot do anything since they will only exchange products bought from BLVGARI corporate websites and Amazon is not affiliated to  BLVGARI Corporation and that i contact Amazon for selling a FAKE PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is it fair for you guys to rip honest trusting customers like us. Shame on U and the CEO of the company who promotes these types of Business Model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;20 Point Perfume Authenticity Checklist:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Confirm Reputable Source of Supply.

    <li> Product was really nice, shipped out on time but the scent itself was not the best for my boyfriend at the time. He still kept and used it.</li>
    <li> I brought this product 6 months back and i am quite impressed with its long lasting smell. I got lot of compliments from others including my doctor about this perfume.... Really like it very much.</li>
    <li> just got this perfume yesterday and the timing of the delivery surpassed my expectation. This perfume is just perfect! not too strong nor too light either. its just the perfect perfume for a working class person that should be used during fall which helps bring out the strenght of the smell. Doesnt really smell during summer. its simply irresistable!</li>
    <li> REally nice one, and last for a long time. The smell is great.     Overall, I would say worth the money spent. I recommend this to everyone who is willing to spend on it. Really worth it.</li>
    <li> When I saw the reviews for this perfume i felt it would be good and moreover amazons price was relatively very low but when i happened smell it, it just sucks...too strong smells like a powder as someone was mentioning like a dog with flea powder i would not recommend this perfume to anyone. i wonder how people like this one..very badddd........plz dont buy it.........</li>
    <li> My son loved this toilette spray.  It was sexy, soft and not over-bearing.  The price was also right not to mention the fragrance.</li>
    <li> BIG BOTTLE FOR THE PRICE!!!! No shipping fee and it got here faster that I thought:) Extremely satisfied!! If YOU have someone that loves to smell good this is the stuff you want!!!</li>
    <li> This scent sucks, it don&#x27;t even last that long and don&#x27;t even smell that good, I can&#x27;t imagine anyone paying the list price....smh</li>
    <li> It is simply a wonderful perfum, and one the best of Bulgari. And the price in Amazon is the best I found!</li>
    <li> I got this item as part of my husband father&#x27;s day gift and it smells like so kind of soap, not what I was expecting at all. Don&#x27;t order perfumes or colognes online unless you are familiar with the scent.</li>
    <li> simply this is one of my best perfumes have pains in his elaboration there any kind of complaints about that I hope to see more brand offerings ARE THE BEST</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my brother for a Christmas gift. He loved it! Not too strong of a scent, smells great! Great price!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe but I think that this is the one of the worst product of Bvlgari. I didn&#x27;t like it I haven&#x27;t met anyone who like it.</li>
    <li> Was given this as a gift 2 Christmas ago, Great scent, not flowery, clean. Make sure you order the Notte version, this has a longer lasting scent than the others</li>
    <li> I bought it for my husband. he loved it. small is wonderfull, last all day long. the prise is best for this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband for Christmas so he would have a new scent going into the New Year. Extremely satisfied with the scent and longevity of only a few sprays. A bit on the powdery side with rich bass notes but not over powering. A little goes a long way. It&#x27;s fresh and clean smelling.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love this wonderful fragrance! It&#x27;s subtle, refreshing, not too strong! I use it both day and night time, although it says \\&quot;Notte\\&quot; for night.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ll try this new product. It is a different product from what i used to have. This is Notte. I hope i will be satisfied enough.</li>
    <li> Been using this perfume for years. It&#x27;s one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> The scent was a little bit too floral for me (almost reminds me of baby powder), but what works for some might not work for others.</li>
    <li> This is nice, but doesn&#x27;t seem to have the concentration or the rich aroma of the NOTTE&#x27;s I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. I&#x27;ve been using this same product for the last approximately 10 years...It&#x27;s too bad  something&#x27;s changed. I still have some of my previous bottle left, this one&#x27;s &amp;#34;weaker&amp;#34;. It used to be my favorite.</li>
    <li> great product i have bought many times before and will definitely buy again in the future it smells so good</li>
    <li> this cologne will lead to courtship behavior, so be fore warned, the ladies will sniff you at some point while you wear this. crisp woodsy/clean spice scent :)</li>
    <li> Like all the Bulgari colognes this one is priced high enough to give you a nosebleed.  But it does not smell as good as the Bulgari original</li>
    <li> My number 1 cologne. When are you guys gonna have another sale</li>
    <li> I love to shop at Amazon more exclusive and if something happens or I get something wrong Amazon has always made me free and better; acquires another company uses Amazon are excellent, Amazon is always an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;this fragrance, for example, I love the way all I can even give gende and love and is also author of Through Amazon, as well as any product I buy, is truly exquisite.</li>
    <li> Really good! same as original! i love it, for some reason i still want it more cheaper! haha. well its still a good price! :)</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I just love my purchase, i always end up as a happy customer, of course i mostly but from sellers fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
    <li> Husband loves the smell!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used and tried some of the well known mens perfume, and this one stands out. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> I accidentally ordered the wrong product for the wrong gender. It actually is very close to the men&#x27;s version. My wife loves it.. lol</li>
    <li> Love the smell. I originally bought this retail at Macy&#x27;s and got compliments nearly daily on the scent so it&#x27;s been a go to for me ever since. It&#x27;s hard to find the scent in stores now since it&#x27;s an older scent and the way the cologne industry is so fickle they release new scents every few months so the older scents (no matter how awesome) get pushed to the back and discontinued for the bright shiny new object. This scent is a soft masculine scent that is really for the night out or the daily wear. It&#x27;s strong enough that you don&#x27;t need a lot but it&#x27;s not overbearing either. The price for the size is unreal online, in stores this would cost near $80 if not more so to get it for less than half that and with the bottle lasting a long time it&#x27;s a win win.</li>
    <li> the best product i have ever purchased on amazon.com.  This cologne smells really good. the ladies love it in bed and anywhere. ladies man.</li>
    <li> Great cologne. One of my favorites</li>
    <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO,  VENDIDO TAL COMO DESCRIBE EN LA WEB DE AMAZON , RECOMENDADO ESPECIALMENTE PARA QUIENES DESEEN DARSE UN REGALO Y AHORRAR AL MISMO TIEMPO</li>
    <li> I love BVLGARI perfumes-- both men and women. And love the way this one smells- fresh, elegant, just a little spicy and manly. I love the bottle and the entire packaging. It&#x27;s just great! And the price is amazing too. Like many I also think that Amazon is a great place to buy stuff that are way too expensive elsewhere.</li>
    <li> It was fast, good,  everything I needed and expected. Really good job and thanks once again. Great doing business with you.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colognes of all time!</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE BRAND EVER</li>
    <li> Hubby brought this home one day and I immediately fell in love with the scent. Been buying it ever since. Not an overpowering fragrance. Citrusy scent that lasts all day, works well with the right pheromones :D lol</li>
    <li> Extremely persistent. My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> As I mentioned before cant go wrong with Bvlgari perfume for men. Another order for a friend of mine. Smells soooo good!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been use this for many year. The same smell, the same blue, like it very much. How to check its shelf-life?</li>
    <li> Bulgary never fails in this product ,  the best aud de toillete from Bulgary, better for any moment of your life.</li>
