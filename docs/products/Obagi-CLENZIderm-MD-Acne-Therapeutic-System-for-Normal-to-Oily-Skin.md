      <li>However it it not as effective as prescription</li>

      <li>/&gt;The best part of the set is the Therapeutic Lotion, as this is what I think is mainly responsible for my skin clearing up.</li>

      <li>This product is incredible and highly effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>the money was completely worth it, amazing results in just a couple days!</li>
      <li>I still have some acne scars to get rid of but so far the results are truly amazing!!</li>
      <li>and I wear a mask all day which I think causes more breakouts.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I put stronger lotion on top to combat the dryness.</li>
      <li>my face is ACNE free!  </li>
      <li>I have seen my skin get even better since I started doing that.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will be ordering more before I run out, as I&#x27;m too scared I&#x27;ll break out again</li>
      <li>\\&quot;ok</li>
      <li>I know I trust the Obagi name and am pleased it works so well.</li>
      <li>I use the system day and night, with the non-comodegenic Obagi Therapeutic Moisturizer and the Obagi C Sunguard with SPF 30 over top (day time</li>
      <li>I have no problems wearing makeup over the top.</li>
      <li>Since beginning my skin has continued to get better and better</li>
      <li>I love this set.</li>
      <li>(She believes this is safe for nursing mothers.)  </li>
      <li>so now I&#x27;m gonna order it for my body :)</li>
      <li>make sure you use lotion when it gets peely</li>
      <li>My oiliness got better but not 100%.</li>
      <li>or I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to continue using it.</li>
      <li>Strong, strong, burns your skin, but gets the job DONE!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with Obagi and I highly recommend it!!!</li>
      <li>It was slightly strange but very welcome.</li>
      <li>It is worth the price!!</li>
      <li>I have spent hundreds of dollars trying to find the best acne system out there.</li>
      <li>The Q-tip also helped my hands because the lotion is so strong that my fingertips started to peel.</li>
      <li>my point of view, I felt that it was effective, and obviously a higher quality than AcneFree and ProActiv.  </li>
      <li>This is the very first review I have written, and it is because I am so pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>The most amazing part of this to me is that even though she is very sensitive to Benzoyl Peroxide, this product doesn&#x27;t seem to give her any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>About six months ago I began using a Clarisonic and that has made a huge difference as well.</li>
      <li>She had perfect skin most of her life, but pregnancy - rather than making her skin better - made it worse.  </li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re light and fading.</li>
      <li>Please try this first!!</li>
      <li>But as I get older, I&#x27;ve been noticing more and more acne and blackheads</li>
      <li>Then I saw a good friend of mine whom I hadnt seen for a long time, and WOW her skin looked amazing!  </li>
      <li>but if you make it through the first month it gets much better.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by the price, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>and I am excited to watch it continue to do so.</li>
      <li>It is well worth it!</li>
      <li>Excited to see what 1 month will look like.</li>
      <li>The only cons is that it is drying but KEEP USING IT AND DON&#x27;T STOP you&#x27;ll go through the peeling and grossness for a good month</li>
      <li>I have used this Clenziderm line now for over and year and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
      <li>This product  leaves you feeling fresh, clean and smelling like apples.</li>
      <li>My acne reduced tremendously.</li>
      <li>Some prescription medication has worked for her, but she can&#x27;t use that when she is pregnant, or when nursing.  </li>
      <li>Even when she wasn&#x27;t pregnant.  </li>
      <li>I have tried numerous acne treatments and so far this product series has been the absolute best.  </li>
      <li>noticed two things that weren&#x27;t very pleasant with initial use of the product, but it goes away after regular use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>To date, I can say that my skin is CLEAR, supple, glowing and I routinely get compliments from total strangers about how beautiful my skin is.</li>
      <li>It just takes a tiny bit so it lasts a pretty good amount of time.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I feel pretty now!</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m 24 (with very light, sensitive skin)and</li>
      <li>My skin actually feels smoother to the touch and the visable difference is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Mine looks like a huge planet on my face and sometimes its the whole solar system.</li>
      <li>I have been using for 1 week today, and my face is completely clear and looks better than it ever has.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Obagi Clenziderm line is amazing. I wish I had taken before and after photos. I have been using the product for about 2 months and the results are awesome. I have struggled with acne since I was 13 and have taken accutane and various other antibiotics and topical ointments in addition to every otc treatment available with little success. This worked pretty fast but has taken about 2 months to get what I consider to be clear skin. I noticed immediate improvement ( w/ a week) but there was dryness and redness to go along with it.....stick it out! The treatment does burn and is unpleasant during first couple weeks but u adjust. Another tip I will add is use cotton rounds with the cleanser and toner...I have seen my skin get even better since I started doing that. This product is worth every penny and I only wish I had known about it earlier in my life. I now feel comfortable being in public without makeup which I would previously wear makeup even go the gym BC I was embarrassed of my skin. Try it....u wont regret it!</li>
    <li> This is the very first review I have written, and it is because I am so pleased with this product.  I am 33 years old and recently stopped using birth control pills.  Since I am older now I did not expect to have any problems with breakouts, unfortunately that was not the case. My face became covered with small bumps, not many big breakouts but my skin was very uneven and I was at the point I was considering going back on the pill just for this reason.  I had heard of obagi products so I did some research and decided to try this set of products first.  I was so glad I did, after one use I could tell a difference!  It was almost unbelievable, and I&#x27;m still a little shocked how quickly my face cleared up.  I have been using for 1 week today, and my face is completely clear and looks better than it ever has.  I only use the set in the morning and then wash with a gentle scrub in the evening.  The pore therapy has made my pores smaller than ever!  Between the pore therapy and the lotion I try and wait several minutes because it&#x27;s a little intense and I have sensitive skin.  My skin has always been oily, I have to blot several times a day and this has helped tremendously with that. I also use an additional moisturizer with spf in it. I am so very glad I came across this product, I will contintue to use and recommend to others.  As I get older the obagi line has many different products that can suit anyones needs.</li>
    <li> Product burns but I&#x27;m seeing results. I have a habit of picking at my face so you have to try not to do that. When I got this product the toner did leaked on the box but I was so anxious to use it I didn&#x27;t care.</li>
    <li> I bought this system a few months ago, and before I review the product I should tell you a little about my history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started on the birth control pill when I was 15, stopped the pill a couple of years ago (I&#x27;m 34 now). When I stopped the pill, I noticed more blemishes within a few weeks. I didn&#x27;t think too much of it because I knew that my hormones were balancing themselves out after being on hormone contraception for so long. To compensate, I purchased Proactiv, and it seemed to help but only for a while. About 8 months ago, my skin was out of control. I mean... OUT of control. I went from having clear skin, to a couple of blemishes here and there, to all out acne explosion. It got so bad sometimes that I stopped going to the gym and stopped doing things that were important to do (grocery shopping, etc). I finally decided to go to a dermatologist, and he recommended all kinds of expensive skin peels and medication. I was reluctant to try medication, so my online search began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending a few weeks researching several acne topical medications, I decided upon Obagi. Truthfully, I didn&#x27;t expect dramatic results and had realistic expectations. Let me tell you, my face did a complete 180 in about 2 weeks. Immediately, I noticed that I was not seeing any NEW breakouts (I had a new pimple daily it seemed). A few days after beginning the system, I noticed the acne I had on my face already was healing quickly, and the acne was less inflamed. Within a week, my face looked normal with makeup, although I had to still wear foundation to cover the red spots that hadn&#x27;t healed 100% yet. Two weeks after beginning the Obagi system, my face is flawless. Completely flawless. I don&#x27;t require makeup, I don&#x27;t have any new inflammation or acne, and my skin looks fresh and clean and young. This product is incredible and highly effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed two things that weren&#x27;t very pleasant with initial use of the product, but it goes away after regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The cream BURNED! It felt like I had a salycic acid peel on my face. It wasn&#x27;t the least bit comfortable. STICK WITH IT! Don&#x27;t give up. If you can power through the burning, it&#x27;ll stop with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Dry skin around nose and neck. I found that I developed some dry skin. I quickly realized that if I put a second layer of the hydration cream (#3 step in the system), it helped immensely. So, wash, put the acne cream on, then put the hydration cream on, wait 10 minutes and apply a little more hydration cream on your dry areas if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, this product is worth every single penny, and I can&#x27;t say enough about it. Truly. It beats everything I&#x27;ve ever tried hands down and I owe my clear skin entirely to Obagi.e.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The cream BURNED! It felt like I had a salycic acid peel on my face.

    <li> For the first time since I was 13 years old, my face is completely acne free. I felt that my acne was hormonal and diet fueled because I would flare up after eating things like cheese, beef, nuts, some seafood, etc. The list goes on! LOL. My face is completely clear now. No more bumps. I still have a few residual hyperpigmented marks leftover but they&#x27;re light and fading. I now feel like i can look people in the eye and hold my head up without feeling like they&#x27;re cringing looking at my face. I can go out without makeup, and workout and do Zumba class without makeup!! I am in my early 40s and i have tried nearly everything on the market from both prescription to non-prescription. I have even tried the Obagi Nuderm system a few years ago but i didn&#x27;t see nearly the results and I was sensitive to parts of that system. I had really given up hope that I would ever have clear skin short of restricting my diet to water, some vegetables, and fruit. Clenziderm started working almost immediately and gradually reduced my number of breakouts until my skin cleared completely. I had 1 or 2 small bumps before my last menstrual cycle but they didn&#x27;t last long.  I&#x27;ve now been using it a liitle over 8 weeks and I hope that my face does not become &#x27;immune&#x27; to it and this system loses its effectiveness like some of the past products I&#x27;ve used in the past. I can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough and can&#x27;t stop rubbing my face and looking in the mirror.</li>
    <li> Seriously I can&#x27;t say enough about this product and please read this. i have been on skin Id for about 3 years and I also take doxycycline  100 mg (antibiotic used to treat acne) everyday for 5 years which causes acid reflux problems really bad but it&#x27;s the only thing that keeps acne at bay just not all the way healed, also I have really oily skin, lots of blackheads and zits all over my chin, jawline, nose and cheeks and some on my forehead, I have had bad skin since I was 12 and I&#x27;ve never been told before by ANYONE that I had beautiful skin. I am extremely self concious of my face &amp; My doctor wouldn&#x27;t give me accutane so I just dealt with proactive and junk. So here I am 25 and about to get married with acne ALL over my shoulders, chest and back and lower back and my face. one day at work I complimented this girl on her skin and she said \\&quot;what?! No way I have terrible skin\\&quot; and I was like \\&quot;your kidding because its like porcelain\\&quot; she said she uses obagi and I was like hold up lemme write this down, I ordered it and completely stopped my doxycycline pills (&amp; since skin I.d. discontinued I really needed something) and so I stopped my pills and was like \\&quot;ok I&#x27;m only gonna use this on my face since its expensive and if this clears up my face ill know it works since my back and chest and everywhere else will be completely broken out still!\\&quot; Well lets just say I&#x27;m so mad I didn&#x27;t take a before and after. I never expected it to work like this.... Ok I&#x27;m really not kidding I am absolutely shocked. I will say I have NEVER had a compliment on my skin besides my tan arma since I&#x27;m Mexican. Anywho needless to say my skin is like porcelain it also took away my Wrinkles, and my pores are nonexistent AND this woman told me my skin was BEAUTIFUL today!!! And I responded \\&quot;omg no way it&#x27;s terrible!!!\\&quot; So she said, \\&quot;yeah right it&#x27;s like porcelain.\\&quot; And I smiled from ear to ear..... I&#x27;m not kidding, email me and I will tell you the honest truth, I am a hairstylist I live in Georgiaan I have no connection to the obagi company! The only cons is that it is drying but KEEP USING IT AND DON&#x27;T STOP you&#x27;ll go through the peeling and grossness for a good month but after it sheds you&#x27;ll be a new person, I can now wear makeup FULL TIME and not break out so now I&#x27;m gonna order it for my body :) next I&#x27;m gonna buy the nuderm or vitamin c line to maintain my porcelain face..... I&#x27;m serious! If you REALLY don&#x27;t believe me ill email you my Facebook and you can see for yourself. After you use this you will never have to deal with acne again. I feel pretty now! P.s. make sure you use lotion when it gets peely :) you&#x27;ll get a zit here and there but be prepared for beautiful skin, oh yeah an it burns sooo bad the first month or two but its just taking the bad layers off. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this set for about a month and I have seen decent improvement.&lt;br /&gt; It is definitely better than any other topical treatment that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt; However it it not as effective as prescription antibiotics.&lt;br /&gt; It is expensive but it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a treatment better than ClenziDerm, and this product is the best product, I really recommend it for anyone has a pore problems.</li>
    <li> I love this product, especially because it seems to have permanently stopped my wife from complaining about her acne!  She had perfect skin most of her life, but pregnancy - rather than making her skin better - made it worse.  Much worse.  Even when she wasn&#x27;t pregnant.  Some prescription medication has worked for her, but she can&#x27;t use that when she is pregnant, or when nursing.  (She believes this is safe for nursing mothers.)  The most amazing part of this to me is that even though she is very sensitive to Benzoyl Peroxide, this product doesn&#x27;t seem to give her any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my point of view, I felt that it was effective, and obviously a higher quality than AcneFree and ProActiv.  My face doesn&#x27;t feel tight (after using the moisturizer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a little pricey, but worth it.  We tried being a little frugal and started with just step 1, then step 2, then finally went for the whole system.  Don&#x27;t bother doing what we did: it&#x27;s best with all three steps.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin, and breakout about once a month. The problem is I have cystic acne when I do breakout. I wished I got those small zits that everyone else gets. Mine looks like a huge planet on my face and sometimes its the whole solar system. I have spent hundreds of dollars trying to find the best acne system out there. I went to Sephora several times trying to find a system that works. I  have also tried proactive. I ran across this kit at a health clinic. I was getting a photo facial done to get rid of some acne scars. This product was front and center as I walked into the door. After the recommendation from the physician&#x27;s assistant, I went straight home to find reviews and a cheaper price. I ordered it and it was amazing. This product  leaves you feeling fresh, clean and smelling like apples. My acne reduced tremendously. I got only one cystic zit during the last 7 months. It may dry your skin out some until your skin gets used to it. My oiliness got better but not 100%. A little bit of product goes a long way. It should last about 7 to 9 months. If you don&#x27;t want to go to a dermatologist, try this system. The healthcare clinic that I went to actually uses all the Obagi products.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product about 2 months ago. I was tempted to write a review only a week after I had it, but I wanted to see how my skin was after I had used it for a while. I am completely amazed and a bit shocked. I have never used something so effective in getting rid of my persistent acne. I, like many other reviewers, have been dealing with this problem for about 15 years. My acne started when I was about 12...I am now 27. I have used everything from ProActiv to retin-A, countless prescription creams and antibiotics. You name it, I used it. This stuff works! If you are hesitant due to the price (which I was), don&#x27;t be. You will not regret this purchase. It&#x27;s been 2 months and I am still no where near close to reordering. It just takes a tiny bit so it lasts a pretty good amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BP lotion did burn...a lot. Especially in the beginning. I literally stuck my face in the freezer one day because it burned so much. I think I was a little ambitious with it at first so I really had to back off. Make sure you are using a good moisturizer every day. I use the cleanser and toner every morning and night and I only use the BP lotion every other morning and I actually apply the lotion with a damp Q-tip. I know it sounds strange, but I am actually in school to become an esthetician and my instructor gave me the idea to dilute the lotion just a tad because it was really harsh on my skin. Once I started doing that, my skin got really clear and it even stopped flaking. The Q-tip also helped my hands because the lotion is so strong that my fingertips started to peel. It was a concern for me considering that I use my hands a lot in school to give facials, but it may not be a concern for other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about getting this stuff, don&#x27;t think about it anymore. Seriously, this product changed my skin. I am completely off all of my prescription creams and my skin has never looked better. Just be aware that it will irritate your skin atfirst, but you will have to adjust it a little bit to get it right and just be patient if it makes you red/flaky at first. It is well worth it!</li>
    <li> I have tried many products for my acne include Proactiv and these products are the best I have used in terms of controlling my acne and not being too strong so that my face dries out</li>
    <li> I have been in and out of dermatologist&#x27;s offices since I got acne in the 5th grade. Now I&#x27;m 24 (with very light, sensitive skin)and my current regimen wasn&#x27;t working any longer (Tazorac, Acanya (Clindamycin+BP), and Minocycline (Antibiotics). I have tried so many products and they usually work for a time and then quit. So far this product has cleared the cystic acne on my chin that came back and kept away new pimples. It was very drying at first but then I started using BareMinerals Purely Nourishing Cream morning and night. I am so happy! I had 2 different dermatologists tell me Accutane was the next step. The Obagi kit took about 3 weeks to stop stinging but it works! Please try this first!!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews ever. But this forced me to. I just turned 20 years old. I never used to struggle with acne until just recently. I used to be \\&quot;that girl\\&quot; who got comments on having beautiful skin. But as I get older, I&#x27;ve been noticing more and more acne and blackheads pop up, especially during that time of the month. I&#x27;ve been losing confidence, so I resorted to everything! I went into Sephora begging for a skin care set (after going through almost every drug store face wash) that would work. They recommended me Bliss No-Zit Sherlock. It worked for a little in the beginning, then like all the others, it stopped. I needed something stronger. So I tried Dermalogica, Pro-Activ, everything. As a college student, I cannot really afford a dermatologist appointment. Finally, I found Obagi on the internet. It seemed pricey, and I was nervous. I was also worried that it would make my skin worse since it is medicated and my skin is relatively normal/sensitive, I thought it would be \\&quot;too much for my skin.\\&quot; But after reading all the reviews I had to try it. IT WAS THE BEST DECISION I HAVE EVER MADE!!!! I noticed a difference after just TWO DAYS of using it! It seriously is so wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using it for about two weeks now, but I&#x27;m never switching. It does burn, and it does make your skin dry out in the beginning, but don&#x27;t give up. I use the face wash morning and night, and the pore toner and lotion only at night. Sometimes I put stronger lotion on top to combat the dryness. I use an spf moisturizer in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I RECOMMEND THIS SYSTEM TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the price, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> I bought these products in a desperate attempt to control my hormonal acne (chin area).  I started using the products twice a day every day and it was too much for my skin.  My skin got super dry.  So I decided to spot treat, only using the products on my chin.  Still too dry.  Now I use the cleanser and toner once a day and the benzoil peroxide twice a day.  That seems to work for me.  My face cleared out some.  I am not going to claim I have a clear complexion now, but I have finally downgraded from using foundation every day to using tinted sunblock.  My goal is to require no makeup, but I can only dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post an update to this when I finish my products</li>
    <li> Absolutley the best acne wash I have EVER used.  I am 44 and have battling acne for years. I have used and tried everything from antibiotics to accutane.  This product is amazing I also bought the line for my 20 years daughter who has tried accutane 3 times with success but within 6 months of getting off it always comes back.  She loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with acne ever since I stopped taking birth control 6-7 years ago! I tried Pro Active, Skin ID, and the list goes on and on. Nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;In the past few years I have been going throuh fertility treatments and taking several different medications that have compeletly made my hormones go crazy. My acne was getting to the point where I had a hard time even going to work.&lt;br /&gt;I finally looked into this product and decided to give it a shot. After about a month I saw results!! My acne is now under control. I do still get tiny ones around the time of my period but thats nothing compared to what I use to deal with on a daily basis. It will dry your skin out at first but if you make it through the first month it gets much better. You have to stick with it and try not to use any other skin care priducts with it other than your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;If you are older like me (29) and are dealing with hormal acne. Please try this product. It&#x27;s expensive but worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This product probably works for a lot of people and I bought it because of all the good reviews. I had such high hopes that this would finally cure my acne. However, after several weeks of using is faithfully, I finally had to stop as it completely ruined my skin. A month after stopping it, my skin still has not recovered. My skin broke out worse than it ever had previously and is still pretty bad. It is dry and still peeling. I think this product works wonders for some and it just may be my skin type. But please be aware that it does not work for everyone and to be cautious when jumping head first into this.</li>
    <li> First i would like to say that I have been an Amazon.com shopper 10+ years and have never written a review.  The results were so amazing that i felt i needed to let Acne sufferers know how great this product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little background, i used to have acne at the age of 14 and after using Retin-A for a few months it went away and never came back, that is until i turned 30.  The worse part now is that the acne was all over my cheeks!  I went to a dermatologist when the acne first started and they told me it was Hormonal and prescribed birth control to get rid of the acne.  After being on the pill for nearly 3 months i saw no sign of improvement and discontinued taking the pill.  After that i used all types of over-the-counter medication and even bought Retin-A in the hopes that it will clear the acne.  None of that stuff worked at ALL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this Obagi system for just 2 months my face is ACNE free!  I still have some acne scars to get rid of but so far the results are truly amazing!!</li>
    <li> I adore these 3 products. I have acne prone skin and I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s. I have tried EVERYTHING! Within one week of using this skin care line, my coworkers were asking about my skin. They noticed the glow and texture before I did... I&#x27;m a Dental Hygienist and I wear a mask all day which I think causes more breakouts. I&#x27;m very pleased with Obagi and I highly recommend it!!! Good luck :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only just using this product for 3 days but 90% of my clogged pores are all cleared up!! the toner can be quite irritating and burning to my face but you have to take it if you really want to clear up your skin.This is the only product that gives me the fastest result for acne and clogged pores, i am so so glad that i finally found it!!:)))</li>
    <li> I never leave reviews unless I feel very strongly about a product.  I have to say I LOVE OBAJI!!!! I am 28 years old and started to battle uncontrollable adult acne.  I ordered this product on a Tuesday, and received it on a Friday.  Within ONE DAY of using it my skin completely cleared up.  After about a week, my skin started to dry out and peel around the chin area, but it has taken every bit of acne (small bumps and large cysts) away. Even as soon as one pimple comes through, the next day it is completely gone.  If I had gone to a dermatologist, I would have probably spent somewhere around 300 dollars between the doctor&#x27;s visit and the antibiotics that they would have prescribed and seen no where near the instantaneous results I had with Obaji.  I will never go back to anything else.  This is a miracle for those battling adult acne.</li>
    <li> I have used this Clenziderm line now for over and year and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  It works so well keeping my face cleared up.</li>
    <li> The service was great!  Best products on the market for acne.  Would highly recommend!  This was recommended by my daughter&#x27;s doctor.</li>
    <li> My laser hair removal lady told me about this product.  I was leery becuase of the price so I opted to not try it.  Then I saw a good friend of mine whom I hadnt seen for a long time, and WOW her skin looked amazing!  I asked what she had been using and she told me that she used the Obagi Nu-Derm line.  She has never battled with acne.  I on the other hand have had acne for almost 20 years.  It started changing from little pimples that would go away quickly to these swimming pool sized pores that clog and create giant disgusting pimples on my face.  Gross!  I have tried Proactive, antibiotics, Murad, and every over the counter product imagineable.  Results were marginal at best.  After reading the reviews I finally purchased this from amazon as it is close to half the price of what the clinic would charge me for the set.  I started using it the day before Christmas and have been using it for about a month now.  I cannot describe how big of a difference this product has already made!  I have taken pictures and will try and upload them at a later date.  But in short here is what I have noticed...it burns like hell for the first week and a half!  Keep breathing and just push through it!  My skin is not shiny all the time, it used to be instantly shiny after washing it.  Now I blot the oil off at the end of the day before washing again.  My pores are now hot tub sized, so that is improvement compared to the swimming pools that they used to be.  I hope they keep shrinking!  I have had exactly 3 pimples in the last month. I think these were mostly hormonal but even still I used to wake up some days and have 3 pimples, so that is just an astounding difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the other reviewers that posted as it helped my decision!  Most importantly, thank you Obagi for helping me win the battle against my acne!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best!!! I have tried EVERYTHING, nothing works as well as this product...highly recommeded to those who can&#x27;t seem to find something that really works!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for 5 years and have tried everything. Gave this a shot as a recommendation from my aunt and the money was completely worth it, amazing results in just a couple days! Excited to see what 1 month will look like. I will continue to use Obagi forever, I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this system twice for my daughter who really likes it.  I know I trust the Obagi name and am pleased it works so well.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous acne treatments and so far this product series has been the absolute best.  I&#x27;m 39 and have been fighting acne for most of my adult life (never really had it as a teenager).  The first couple of days my skin felt like it was on fire.  I use it only at night.  After the second treatment my face was fine and I could instantly tell a difference.  My skin actually feels smoother to the touch and the visable difference is amazing.  I also notice my acne scars diminishing which is an added bonus.  Although pricey, it was so worth the investment for my face.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING! The first two weeks were hell... I have never had a product burn as intensely as this product did. After a few weeks my skin got used to it though, so THANK GOD for that or I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to continue using it. After using the system for three days, all of the black heads on and around my nose popped out (literally) and haven&#x27;t returned. It was slightly strange but very welcome. I have had a few spots pop up since beginning, but as with any acne product... you&#x27;re skin is going to purge. The few spots that I have had have healed quickly and are smaller than the spots I was getting before. Since beginning my skin has continued to get better and better and I am excited to watch it continue to do so. It hasn&#x27;t made any difference on my acne scars, but it is clearing up my hyper-pigmentation marks like nobody&#x27;s busy! It does make your skin extremely dry, so make sure to use a good moisturizer and keep it far away from the sensitive skin around your eyes. I am using this product in conjunction with a Clarisonic, Ziana gel and spironolactone (75mg). I complete the regimen as directed (wait 15 minutes between steps), put on my Ziana gel and wait for it to dry and then finish up with moisturizer. I do this twice a day. I have no problems wearing makeup over the top. My skin&#x27;s oil production has decreased drastically since beginning. An added bonus, the crows feet I was beginning to get around my eyes and the baby wrinkles I was starting to get between my eyebrows have completely disappeared. A little history about me... I am a 28 year old female who started breaking out after the birth of my daughter at 24. I have tried everything to try and clear my skin but NOTHING has worked including a round of Accutane, multiple chemical peels, antibiotics, many over-the-counter products, Proactiv and every topical treatment the dermatologist could prescribe. I think everyone&#x27;s skin is different and what works for one person won&#x27;t necessarily work foranother, but I am so thankful that I have found what works for me.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and exactly what I expected (♡_♡)I will puchase again. I definetely recommend this to all my friends and co worker....</li>
    <li> I never write a review and just had to for the Obagi products. I never had acne while a teen and unfortunately am suffering from it BIG TIME as an adult. I&#x27;ve tried everything...and I mean everything - over the years to finally get my breakouts under control. Pills, potions, Proactiv. You name it. I&#x27;ve tried it. I was surfing around over the holidays and saw the Obagi line came up. I&#x27;ve never heard of it but it seemed to get good reviews. I tried it and in just a week saw results! I was almost in tears. FINALLY! I would recommend this to anyone who like me could not find a fix for adult acne. It is worth the price!!</li>
    <li> I got this product earlier this year, I was in a crisis of skin and I tried everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face wash:  too weak, didn&#x27;t remove make-up at all, felt more like a lotion&lt;br /&gt;The acid: Strong, strong, burns your skin, but gets the job DONE! I would be very cautious when using this, start w/once a day and only a small amount, its strong and will easily dry out your skin.  Build yourself up to 2x/day.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion: good, soothing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I did not like was the wash, I would try the set out and see how it works for you.  Then buy products as needed. I found my normal lotion was a fine replacement, and any gentle wash would do.  I only now buy the acid, as it kicks butt and has made my skin beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who has &#x27;tried everything&#x27; this is something you should def. try.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I feel this Clenziderm set is better and lasts longer than the normal to dry skin set.</li>
    <li> I have been using Obagi Clenziderm for the past year. After having enough of battling highly acne-prone skin (since elementary school-- I&#x27;m in my late 20s) I sought out an esnetician, changed by makeup routine (bare minerals), juggled some meds (YAZ), and began using Obagi. At first my skin did get red. It did feel hot. I slowly worked up to the recommended routine and have been a faithful user ever since. About six months ago I began using a Clarisonic and that has made a huge difference as well. I don&#x27;t use moisturizer and my skin is never flaky or dull. To date, I can say that my skin is CLEAR, supple, glowing and I routinely get compliments from total strangers about how beautiful my skin is. I cannot believe the difference Obagi Clenziderm has made in my complexion and I will continue using this product as long as I can. If you have lived with the embarrassment of chronic acne and NOTHING has worked for you, do yourself a favor and try this product. Yes, it is pricey. But think about the money you will save and the let-down you will avoid not having to try another drug store wonder product that doesn&#x27;t work. If your situation sounds anything like mine, BUY this product, use it as directed, and enjoy your new found confidence!</li>
    <li> This product works extremely well. I was nervous about buying it online vs from my dermatologist but it seems to be working the same.</li>
    <li> I was breaking out all over my neck and face with cystic pimples and it was just gross. My personal trainer recommended this product to me and I decided to give it a try. I started using clenziderm almost a month now, and it has done wonders.. I experienced peeling and redness for almost 2 weeks but that went away almost immediately. I would definitely continue to buy this product for me.</li>
    <li> I have a hormonal acne,..terrible acne it wont go away,..i got this product Nov.14,2012.,the product is very strong,it will dry your face.the first month all the whiteheads and acne will come out like all over ur face.It is so frustrating bcoz u cant cover it with make up flakey and itchy,my face is inflame the toner and lotion are very strong u have to use very small amount like a pea size coz it feels like ur face is on fire,.all u need in the process is a lot of patience coz i almost give up,i was just holding on bcoz i paid a lot for the product.And now im just glad i hang on to it my acne starting to clear up now my chin no bumps no whiteheads,im happy with the results for now,i still have some acne between my eyes and forehead but i notice its starting to clear up,the product may last 2 1/2 months..cant wait to be acne free,now im just concern about acne scars..im happy with the product just have a lot of patience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 40s and started having major skin issues and breakouts on my face (oily skin) unlike any I&#x27;ve ever had before.  I had tried EVERYTHING sold in regular stores and even some high-end cometic products and nothing worked at all.  In a desperate move, I searched the internet looking for a product that might help and I read the reviews on this product which sounded like it might be a solution for me.  I thought the price was a bit high but decided to take the gamble.  I love the product! It is a three-step regimine. It&#x27;s also a strong product and sometimes it does burn a little but that only lasts a few minutes. If it gets to be too drying I just skip the last two steps for a day and then go back to all three steps the next day.  I&#x27;m very happy with the product and I have quit using all other products.  I will be buying more in the future. It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love this set. It TOTALLY WORKS!!! My skin began clearing up right away (noticed a difference the next morning even) and now my skin is totally clear and it&#x27;s been about four weeks. The improvement was gradual, but quite fast. I use the system day and night, with the non-comodegenic Obagi Therapeutic Moisturizer and the Obagi C Sunguard with SPF 30 over top (day time only).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried countless other prescription oral and topical meds to treat acne, and the only thing that ever worked was the oral stuff (usually antibiotics), but I obviously can&#x27;t stay on that forever; it&#x27;s not healthy, expensive, the effects usually decreases over time, and I end up with intolerable side effects, like crazy itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Daily Care Foaming Cleanser makes my face feel clean and fresh without over-drying. It smelled a little funny at first, like menthol-apples, but now I enjoy it. I remove my eye-makeup (I don&#x27;t wear face make-up) with Cetaphil first, and then the Obagi cleanser on the rest of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pore-Therapy solution is non-irritating and even though it says to wait 15 minutes after washing, I can put it on right away without any stinging sensations. It makes my face feel extra clean, no matter how thoroughly I wash beforehand. The cotton ball with the solution always seems to pick up extra dirt on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of the set is the Therapeutic Lotion, as this is what I think is mainly responsible for my skin clearing up. Over the past year, my face became intolerable to any other brand containing benzoyl peroxide, even 2.5%. My eyes would puff up and become really itchy (even though I didn&#x27;t put it in my eye area), and I&#x27;d get itchy patches on other parts of my face. Strangely enough, Obagi has has 5% and my face tolerates it completely! At first I put my eye cream on, followed by Vaseline in my eye area before applying the lotion just to be safe, as the eye area can absorb other stuff you put on your face even if youdidn&#x27;t apply it there. Over time, I stopped using the Vaseline and now I don&#x27;t even need to put any cream in my eye area first. My face has gotten completely used to the Therapeutic Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more before I run out, as I&#x27;m too scared I&#x27;ll break out again if I stop using this set.</li>
