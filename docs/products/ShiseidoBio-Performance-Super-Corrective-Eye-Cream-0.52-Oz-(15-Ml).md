<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like it but I don&#x27;t notice my fine lines disappearing...its rich but not greasy. I use it at night mostly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a product junkie.  I can&#x27;t say this did much for me.  I do however have sensitive skin (combination) and I had no breakouts or irritations, and it adjusted to my combo skin well.</li>
    <li> Very nice eye care out there.  Shiseido is true to their product.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, i saw a tremendous improvement around my eyes particularly under my eyes. I love how moisturizing, plumping, firming &amp; brightening is this eye cream. I gave it four stars because it is a bit expensive but definitely worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery  happy  with  the product</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews from the 1 stars to the 5 stars, I have puffiness issues under my eyes that age me and make me look tired. I had been using a at home mixture with which I was very happy with. my at home mixture cost about 2 to 3 bucks to make, this stuff cost me $50. The at home mixture works instantly, what this other product does is give the eye area a good moisturizing, that&#x27;s not what I want I wanted the swelling to decrease in size and maybe take away that crease I have on both sides. I don&#x27;t care to much for this.</li>
    <li> So worth it, I love it! Perfect weight for my dry skin and I do believe the fine lines are disappearing.</li>
    <li> Best eye cream to reduce fine lines and dark circles under eyes! Second bottle purchased and very satisfied.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m really liking this product. First off I&#x27;m very prone to getting Milia from many eye creams..with this NONE! Also, I have seen a difference in firmness and crepeness. Prior to this eye cream I had been using another high end cream (starting with a &amp;#34;O&amp;#34; and this this one surpasses.&lt;br /&gt;(To add, I&#x27;m 41, have dry skin and am also an aesthetician)</li>
    <li> Great product!! I have been using it for years and it really works.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is more of a moisturizer vs an anti-aging cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 mos and I love the way it quickly absorbs into my skin unlike the benefience brand by shiseido.</li>
    <li> I am using it twice a day for a few years now, living in a sunny state, and nobody gives me my age.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FABULOUS EYE CREAM FOR APPROXIMAYELY TWO YEARS AND (I SAY THIS MODESTLY, OF COURSE), I HAVE ONLY THE VERY FAINTEST LINES UNDER MY EYES WHICH LOOK GREAT FOR A SEVENTY-SEVEN YEAR OLD WOMAN.  IT KEEPS THE SKIN SOFT AND SUPPLE AND MAKES IT MUCH  MORE RECEPTIVE TO ANY UNDER-EYE CONCEALER YOU MAY NEED.</li>
    <li> This product is great, it works very good . The skin around my eyes looks much smooth, and the fines lines are almost gone! I love it!</li>
    <li> It really works well to diminish fine lines, give even tone &amp; a healthy glow to my skin.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> super eye cream wish i had tried this sooner</li>
    <li> I have used it for a few weeks and love it!</li>
    <li> Great product  Use it all the time</li>
    <li> Product applies well.. not sticky.  Mild temporary reduction of eye wrinkles noted.  Product is too expensive for small amount of gain.</li>
    <li> Love this cream. Skin feels smooth and light. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
