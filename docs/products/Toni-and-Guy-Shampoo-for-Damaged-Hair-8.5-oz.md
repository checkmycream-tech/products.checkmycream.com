      <li>smells ok.  </li>
      <li>love the design of the bottle.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many conditioner</li>
      <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
      <li>Ive used better shampoos that L&#x27;oreal makes.</li>
      <li>I think this is an OK shampoo.</li>
      <li>While I didn&#x27;t end up with movie-star or model hair, it was visibly better than before.</li>
      <li>He seems to be enjoying it.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo for damaged hair..</li>
      <li>I like a citrus or my favorite Paul Mitchell line of product scent.</li>
      <li>That might come as a no brainer to some, but I found it worked much better once I massaged it in.</li>
      <li>This is okay.</li>
      <li>I did use it with the &#x27;matching&#x27; conditioner, and as a system, it works better than this shampoo alone.</li>
      <li>and since I didn&#x27;t have my glasses on, I ended up unscrewing the top to dispense it.</li>
      <li>Love the Toni and Guy products.</li>
      <li>I bought this brand at Target, but found it on Amazon for a better price.  </li>
      <li>Rather than producing foam, it produced more of a cream.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wondering if it suites me better to use this product just once in a while.</li>
      <li>Honestly I didn&#x27;t think this shampoo was anything special.  </li>
      <li>I love strongly scented products, but I realize that it will not be to everyone&#x27;s taste.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice, mild smell to it.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leak, and is fairly secure for a top, so I felt confident taking it to the gym.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>The main thing I noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t have as strong a fragrance as I&#x27;m used to with most shampoos - and I find that I kind of miss that!</li>
      <li>the carbon-like feel of the bottle as well, easy to grab</li>
      <li>It has a strong floral scent, I&#x27;d put the emphasis on strong.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell and super clean feel this leaves!</li>
      <li>so it is easy to pour out when full and the top unscrews easily when you get to the bottom on the bottle</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used lots of products and it works fine.  </li>
      <li>lather is nice - it&#x27;s fairly rich but doesn&#x27;t feel exactly luxurious.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo helps to smooth it</li>
      <li>It did smooth it a bit.  </li>
      <li>but well worth it for anyone that needs to revitalize their hair and keep it healthy.</li>
      <li>It cleans my hair and removes all the build up and leaves it silky smooth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent is light, which is a pleasure since I don&#x27;t want to stick up the bathroom/house with my hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells nice, cleans my hair really well and seems to leave it a bit softer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>You pay for the privilege, but if you&#x27;re looking to sport better hair, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>My hair feels its most fresh and shiny since years ago.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft and not frizzy, while retaining a good amount of volume.  </li>
      <li>It does a good job of cleansing my hair and it rinses clear.</li>
      <li>silky soft and smelling good.</li>
      <li>and it just feels so light and fluffy but looks perfectly put-together?</li>
      <li>I really love the clean, fresh scent of this shampoo.</li>
      <li>It left my hair clean and smelling great.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo and conditioner is better than most salon offers and it is cheaper!</li>
      <li>This is my first try with Toni&amp;Guy, and while I don&#x27;t regret it, it&#x27;s not the magic elixir I hoped it might</li>
      <li>My hair was &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean so there is no residue still clinging</li>
      <li>It smelled more like professional hair care products than most of my shampoo does.</li>
      <li>This product works well and my hair feels clean when I use it.</li>
      <li>It lathers well and rinses clean without leaving residue, but it does leave it feeling a lot softer.</li>
      <li>lather&#x27;s rich and very hair softening, i love this shampoo...</li>
      <li>I honestly can&#x27;t remember what I thought of the shampoo, but the conditioners were great.&lt;br /&gt;About 5 years ago mega-giant Unilever bought the company, so I was surprised to see that this shampoo is still made in Italy.</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how nice this shampoo was....</li>
      <li>This shampoo moisturizes it a bit (but definitely still want to use a conditioner) and give it a bit of weight to take off the volume (which is actually good for me).</li>
      <li>Bought this full size after trying out a travel size from local drug store and loved it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like shampoos with a heavy scent, so I was happy with the light, herbal fragrance of this product.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s more normal towards the roots.  </li>
      <li>This is quite a good shampoo for dry hair.  </li>
      <li>shampoo lathers well, rinses easily and has a reasonable degree of fragrance, and it seems like it makes a good day-to-day shampoo for those with dry or brittle hair.</li>
      <li>As someone who struggles with dry hair, I found that this shampoo was more effective than most advertising to do the same thing.</li>
      <li>The bottle was super easy to use, it&#x27;s not a thick shampoo</li>
      <li>The smell is nice enough.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel soft and it looks so much better.</li>
      <li>This is definitely near the top of the list of products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean but not stripped of its natural oils which is important to me.  </li>
      <li>Nothing really stands out about it as I write this except for the unique design of the bottle.</li>
      <li>so I was not shocked that I like this shampoo so much.</li>
      <li>It gives a great salon experience without costing a small fortune.  </li>
      <li>one thing I&#x27;d point out is that you really have to work this shampoo into your hair to reap the full benefits.</li>
      <li>But my hair does become a bit less frizzy when I use this with a good conditioner.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is okay. If you have really thin hair might want to consider using other product. I have thick hair and this made it heavy and lifeless.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and super clean feel this leaves!</li>
    <li> This is a nice, light shampoo that&#x27;s great for people that want a light scent and a touch of conditioning. I was satisfied with the product&#x27;s performance on my thick hair. I don&#x27;t like shampoos with a heavy scent, so I was happy with the light, herbal fragrance of this product. You&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s there out of the shower, but soon after that it&#x27;s not strong enough to cover up perfume or cologne. A few reviewers mentioned that the fragrance is on the masculine side; I agree with that assessment, though feel that the smell is close to being neutral, leaning slightly to a masculine scent. The shampoo does leave hair a little bit softer than many shampoos on the market. Of course it&#x27;s not the same as using standalone conditioner, but it&#x27;ll get the job done on days when you want to give your hair a break from heavy product use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never actually heard of this brand before, but I am always on the search for a shampoo and conditioner that will do something to help out my dry, damaged, frizzy, uncontrollable hair. I really like this line of shampoo and conditioner. The scent is pleasant and very light, not overpowering at all. It makes my hair feel soft and it looks so much better. Every time I use both the shampoo and conditioner I love it even more!</li>
    <li> This Toni&amp;Guy Cleanse Shampoo is great. It smells great, cleanses thoroughly and leaves hair silky soft and smelling good. What more can you ask for? I find that I don&#x27;t have to use much of it either. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I first tried Tony&amp;Guy years ago in the UK. I honestly can&#x27;t remember what I thought of the shampoo, but the conditioners were great.&lt;br /&gt;About 5 years ago mega-giant Unilever bought the company, so I was surprised to see that this shampoo is still made in Italy. I&#x27;m also surprised that it lathers so much, it&#x27;s clearly a formula for Americans.&lt;br /&gt;It cleanses well, no better than similarly priced shampoos.I did use it with the &#x27;matching&#x27; conditioner, and as a system, it works better than this shampoo alone.</li>
    <li> Love the Toni and Guy products. I have gray hair and this shampoo for damaged hair has added a softness to the stubborn gray!</li>
    <li> The first time I used the Cleanse Shampoo and Conditioner I felt like it wasn&#x27;t washing out of my hair all the way. When I dried my hair, it felt heat and weighed down by the product. After it was dried though it truly looked amazing. My hair laid well, styled easily and had less frizz. The style lasted 3 days before I washed again without looking greasy, which I appreciated, being a mom that can&#x27;t get a hair washing in everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product dispenses nicely, and will last quite a long time as a little bit goes a long way. The shampoo foams just enough to make you feel the cleaning. The conditioner is very thick and coats your hair completely. It  has a bit of a masculine scent to it, but it doesn&#x27;t linger and didn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really loved the Toni&amp;Guy line.</li>
    <li> I found this to be pretty standard shampoo - it worked about as well on my hair as my previous product (in other words, it cleaned it fine).  My hair is slightly damaged, but not overly so.  The main thing I noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t have as strong a fragrance as I&#x27;m used to with most shampoos - and I find that I kind of miss that!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo for damaged hair..lather&#x27;s rich and very hair softening, i love this shampoo...my hair felt soft with this shampoo a big plus,..i will definitely rebuy this..but in larger bottle!!!</li>
    <li> This Toni&amp;Guy shampoo worked okay for my dry hair.  I tried this product because I color my hair regularly, as well as blow dry and flat iron.  The ends of my hair have become dry, so I thought I would give this a try.  I found it to be a little heavy on my hair, making it somewhat flat looking.  It has a nice, mild smell to it.  I actually like Toni&amp;Guys conditioner better than the shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is quite a good shampoo for dry hair.  It has a strong floral scent, I&#x27;d put the emphasis on strong.  I was happy with it- I love strongly scented products, but I realize that it will not be to everyone&#x27;s taste.  The lather this shampoo creates is a bit different from what I&#x27;m used to.  Rather than producing foam, it produced more of a cream.  It left my hair clean and smelling great.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> The bottle itself is in shape and proportion like a slightly small tube of caulk.  That made me like it.  To me it was only a little strange &amp;#34;opening&amp;#34; it, because one presses one side of the top and the other side pops up just a little.  But that makes it great to close - just push the raised half of the top down and it clicks shut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo lathers well.  It rinses out nicely.  Hair truly feels soft afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is to me like tangerines.</li>
    <li> I really love the clean, fresh scent of this shampoo. The scent does not linger in my hair, but it makes the shampoo experience a little nicer. It lathers well and rinses clean without leaving residue, but it does leave it feeling a lot softer. The cap opens with an unusual push button. I didn&#x27;t realize this the first time I used it in the shower and since I didn&#x27;t have my glasses on, I ended up unscrewing the top to dispense it. If your vision is as bad as mine, check out the cap before you step in the shower. This is a shampoo that I would gladly buy in the future.</li>
    <li> Toni&amp;Guy Cleanse Shampoo for Damaged Hair really does what it says. The hair that it was used on was brittle and frizzy and after using this shampoo it became soft and manageable. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have dry, color treated hair so I thought I would give this shampoo a try. It does a good job of cleansing my hair and it rinses clear. It has a mild, pleasant fragrance. I had no problems with this shampoo, but I did not feel it was superior to the cheaper shampoos I have tried.</li>
    <li> This shampoo feels more like a conditioner due to it being creamy. The scent is very subtle, which I like. I have dry hair that has a lot of volume. This shampoo moisturizes it a bit (but definitely still want to use a conditioner) and give it a bit of weight to take off the volume (which is actually good for me).</li>
    <li> Honestly I didn&#x27;t think this shampoo was anything special.  I&#x27;ve used lots of products and it works fine.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I have damaged hair, but it does gets very dry and frizzy in the winter. I really like this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice, cleans my hair really well and seems to leave it a bit softer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only discovered the Toni&amp;Guy brand very recently, but have really liked all of their products that I&#x27;ve tried and will continue to use them. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of creamy shampoos, despite having dry hair.  The result is generally flat and clumpy.  Somehow, this Toni&amp;Guy shampoo didn&#x27;t do that.  My hair is soft and not frizzy, while retaining a good amount of volume.  I also like the almost nonexistent smell, which is similar to other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; men&#x27;s fragrances.  Finally, the way it opens is just cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have hair that needs serious conditioning, this may not be the right product, but it works well for hair that is suffering from seasonal dryness without making it look like it was soaked in fabric softener.</li>
    <li> I used both these Cleanse Shampoo and Conditioner for damaged hair from Toni &amp; Guy together to give the product line a fair shake and I was fairly impressed with the results. My hair is not incredibly damaged, but it does suffer from frizziness and flyaway hair to some extent. It&#x27;s also somewhat dull, as much due to my age (49) as anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of both the shampoo and cleanser made my hair look smoother while retaining volume (often a difficult feat) as well as enhanced shine. While I didn&#x27;t end up with movie-star or model hair, it was visibly better than before. This was after only one use, so I can imagine it may improve further with multiple uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the shampoo, I was not a fan of the scent. It smelled more like professional hair care products than most of my shampoo does. That&#x27;s not a bad thing, but it&#x27;s not a smell that I&#x27;m a great fan of. Also, this is a little expensive for a small amount, but the truth is that it lathers up like mad so you really need just a little, even when you have an enormous amount of hair like I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to think that all hair care products were basically the same, but I&#x27;ve learned with experience that some really do a better job smoothing, conditioning, adding shine, and body. This is definitely near the top of the list of products I&#x27;ve tried. You pay for the privilege, but if you&#x27;re looking to sport better hair, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product and used both the shampoo and conditioner&lt;br /&gt;1. The shape and size of the bottles were easy to open and handle in the shower&lt;br /&gt;2. The fragrance was not overwhelming lingering in my hair&lt;br /&gt;3. I have medium length hair and only needed a small amount of either the shampoo or conditioner&lt;br /&gt;4. My hair was &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean so there is no residue still clinging&lt;br /&gt;5. Left my hair soft and easy to manage&lt;br /&gt;6. My hair did not require washing every day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My hair is just very long, with dry damaged ends but it&#x27;s more normal towards the roots.  I found the shampoo did a good job of balancing the shape of my hair out, although it wasn&#x27;t all that moisturizing by itself.  When used with the conditioner, it was a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;I love the design of the bottle.  You push the top down, and the other side pops up where it comes out, and it comes out in a very good amount so that you get enough but you don&#x27;t waste it.  It doesn&#x27;t leak, and is fairly secure for a top, so I felt confident taking it to the gym.&lt;br /&gt;It smells ok.  It&#x27;s a unisex smell, that seemed actually a bit subtle at first, but it stayed with my hair for the next day.&lt;br /&gt;The lather is nice - it&#x27;s fairly rich but doesn&#x27;t feel exactly luxurious.  It&#x27;s about in line with most drug store brands.&lt;br /&gt;Alone, it did not weigh my hair down.  It did smooth it a bit.  I didn&#x27;t see an increase in tangles when I continued to use it.  It does seem to moisturize very damaged, dry ends.</li>
    <li> I love Toni &amp; Guy products and this one is no exception.  It gives a great salon experience without costing a small fortune.  You just need a tiny bit and it&#x27;s goes a long way.  My hair feels so much softer considering I do color my hair and that in itself will damage your hair.  I would recommend this on a heartbeat.  Best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse, dry, naturally wavy/curly, virgin hair that I flat iron daily and wash twice weekly. It is hard to find a good shampoo that gets my roots clean and my ends conditioned - it&#x27;s a tough balance. I have tried all sorts of crazy expensive shampoos to just semi-expensive and a mix of the two. From Bed Head (which was the same brand as Toni &amp; Guy), Kerastase, Pureology, Paul Mitchell, Alterna, Bumble, Aveda, literally the list goes on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually really liked Bed Head shampoo so I was not shocked that I like this shampoo so much. It cleans my hair and removes all the build up and leaves it silky smooth. I can go 3-4 days without it looking greasy or weighed down. I literally have no complaints about this shampoo. It&#x27;s now my go to shampoo and conditioner (The Toni&amp;Guy Cleanse Conditioner) and I will continue to buy it. Love Love Love!</li>
    <li> I really like Toni &amp; Guy Cleanse Shampoo for Damaged Hair.  My hair is very dry with lots of split ends.  This shampoo helps to smooth it and I have noticed that it is not as dry as with other shampoos.  I have been using it for a little over a month and have good luck thus far.  It leaves my hair feeling clean but not stripped of its natural oils which is important to me.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> I need moisturizing shampoo and the Biolage that I used to use has changed formulas and doesn&#x27;t work for me anymore.  So, I&#x27;ve been searching for my next go to.  Since I already use the leave in conditioner, I gave this a try.  It seems to give me a fair amount of moisture, but I dislike the smell.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t smell like their leave in conditioner.  It has a manly scent than what I would prefer.  I used it for a few times and then have casually mentioned to my husband that he should finish the bottle.  He seems to be enjoying it.</li>
    <li> Bought this full size after trying out a travel size from local drug store and loved it. Leaving the hair grease-free for 24-36 hr, which is already quite an improvement from my previous 20-24 hr. Slightly scented. Little product does the work. My hair feels its most fresh and shiny since years ago. Dumped all my Pantene / Phyto / Loccitane after getting this.&lt;br /&gt;Love the carbon-like feel of the bottle as well, easy to grab</li>
    <li> I think this is an OK shampoo. Nothing really stands out about it as I write this except for the unique design of the bottle. The shampoo smells faintly of plastic, the consistency is runny. I didn&#x27;t notice&lt;br /&gt;an enhancement to my hair. I felt as if it dried it out more. Ive used better shampoos that L&#x27;oreal makes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be one of the few non-Vine reviewers here - no free sample for me! (Though I was introduced to the product through a subscription beauty box.) I have fine and now slightly thinning highlighted blonde hair with probably 20% gray, which can be a pain to take care of, especially as I wear it long. My biggest nemesis, though, is oiliness; most conditioners leave my hair a limp mess by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I tried my sample of this shampoo &amp; conditioner I was absolutely stunned at how my hair felt and &amp;#34;behaved.&amp;#34; You know that feeling when you get your hair cut and it just feels so light and fluffy but looks perfectly put-together? That&#x27;s how my hair feels after using these products! I immediately came to Amazon after my second shower/style to purchase the pair, as this just became my Holy Grail of hair care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many conditioner but this one is the best! Makes my hair feels smooth and smells great! You have to try this, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the Toni and Guy Cleanse shampoo for damaged hair. It made a gorgeous lather that even felt moisturizing while sudsing up. The smell is nice enough. It&#x27;s unisex and fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this really left my hair moisturized. I have wiry grey hair now. That transition has been a little challenging. By my unruly hair loved this stuff. It left it softer without weighting it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry, damaged, or coarse hair this is a great shampoo.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how nice this shampoo was....it has a simple, almost negligible scent, but the thing I really like is the shine afterwards.  Perhaps because I&#x27;ve been rinsing my hair in cold water, but with this shampoo, I&#x27;m noticing nice shine on my damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that this one doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes and sting like other shampoos, it stays on my hair and roots and lets me leave it a bit without running.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to do my long hair, so I think this will last just as long as bigger bottles of shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product works well and my hair feels clean when I use it. I don&#x27;t usually care much about shampoos since the conditioner does most of the work. But my hair does become a bit less frizzy when I use this with a good conditioner.  So I use it for special occasions and the regular cheaper shampoo otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light, which is a pleasure since I don&#x27;t want to stick up the bathroom/house with my hair.</li>
    <li> Just like many products that I&#x27;ve tried, my hair reacts favorably to the first application, then reacts poorly the second time. I&#x27;m wondering if it suites me better to use this product just once in a while. I&#x27;m still experimenting so can&#x27;t draw any conclusions yet. Just had to try this shampoo because it has my name on it!</li>
    <li> I bought this brand at Target, but found it on Amazon for a better price.  This shampoo and conditioner is better than most salon offers and it is cheaper!</li>
    <li> I feel like I&#x27;m constantly trying new shampoos and hair care products in hopes of finding that one &amp;#34;silver bullet&amp;#34; that will transform my hair in some cool new way. This is my first try with Toni&amp;Guy, and while I don&#x27;t regret it, it&#x27;s not the magic elixir I hoped it might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo lathers well, rinses easily and has a reasonable degree of fragrance, and it seems like it makes a good day-to-day shampoo for those with dry or brittle hair. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling softer, shinier or silkier than most other brands, so it&#x27;s hard to get too excited over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is fair and a little goes a long way, so I suppose it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> This Toni&amp;Guy Shampoo will totally clean your hair as well as improve the quality of it leaving it soft, manageable and with little or no frizz.  It has an inoffensive odor that recalls a hair salon that is not noticeable on dried hair.  This is a relatively expensive product but well worth it for anyone that needs to revitalize their hair and keep it healthy.</li>
    <li> As someone who struggles with dry hair, I found that this shampoo was more effective than most advertising to do the same thing. It has results that you can see when you get out of the shower and it smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I&#x27;d point out is that you really have to work this shampoo into your hair to reap the full benefits. That might come as a no brainer to some, but I found it worked much better once I massaged it in. I don&#x27;t know if someone activates or whatnot, but it made a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those seeking to put an end to dry hair, this is worth a try. You only need to use a little bit and it works pretty well.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t dry out my (50 year old, curly, Irish, trimmed every other month), hair more than any other product. The scent was light and pleasing, hard for me to place, floral I guess. I like a citrus or my favorite Paul Mitchell line of product scent. The bottle was super easy to use, it&#x27;s not a thick shampoo so it is easy to pour out when full and the top unscrews easily when you get to the bottom on the bottle so you can use it all.</li>
    <li> The Toni Guy shampoo has a nice fragranced leaves my hair feeling healthy.</li>
