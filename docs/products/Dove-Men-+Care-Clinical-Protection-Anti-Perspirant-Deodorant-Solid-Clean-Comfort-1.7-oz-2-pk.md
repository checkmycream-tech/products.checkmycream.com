### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;After trying everything on the market, this product is the best.</li>
      <li>Nothing I have found has been unstoppable but this is probably the best product I have found.</li>
      <li>and he said it is working great!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good and at a great deal!  </li>
      <li>LOL</li>
      <li>but she thinks it smells like some kind of bug spray!</li>
      <li>She just laughed.</li>
      <li>Good looking out</li>
      <li>I will continue to use it probably forever because it works and smells good.</li>
      <li>Good looking out Mom.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied with the product</li>
      <li>I got a sample of this and really liked the smell.  </li>
      <li>AND it has a nice smell.  </li>
      <li>It starts to adjust itself as you use it, but I wish there was a better way to keep this from happening.</li>
      <li>More of a paste than a stick.</li>
      <li>this stuff smells phenomenal</li>
      <li>Better than non clinical protection.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m more relaxed in crowded spaces, I lift my arms with confidence, and don&#x27;t hesitate to remove my jacket.  </li>
      <li>This product was okay.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Hopefully they will be able to correct this design flaw.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not in love with the scent but this deodorant works better for me</li>
      <li>Overall, the deodorant works great and leaves me feeling confident that I don&#x27;t smell or have sweat marks on my underarms!</li>
      <li>This deodorant is great for men with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The good thing about this is that it works as a really good moisturizer and the smell is weak and pleasant.    </li>
      <li>(sometimes they smell like &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; but if you get one of the clean comfort, etc., it smells much better).</li>
      <li>The smell is not overly strong, so it&#x27;s not a gigantic problem, just something to consider before buying.</li>
      <li>This deodorant doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent to it so it won&#x27;t bother your skin</li>
      <li>or if you have sensitivity to strong scents.</li>
      <li>That made it more worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap, but you need a doctors note.</li>
      <li>This highly effective deodorant, I have done very well with it,</li>
      <li>If you want to odor-up, use a cologne (lightly).</li>
      <li>In my opinion, Right Guard Clinical works better.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like super strong, perfumey smelling deodorant</li>
      <li>Well it&#x27;s worth it if you like a clean smell and no sweat !</li>
      <li>This Clean Comfort has a light, clean smell -- not at all overpowering.  </li>
      <li>The best product for excessive sweating i have used.</li>
      <li>Oh yeah - so cool.  </li>
      <li>And the best thing it lasts throughout the entire day even if it is hot or humid outside</li>
      <li>It does help though and keeps you smelling fresh.</li>
      <li>Either way, this stuff smells like fresh cat litter or maybe baby powder.</li>
      <li>But worth every dime...</li>
      <li>You will end up smelling like her cat or a freshly cleaned baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an athletic male that is severely allergic to fragrances and many other ingredients found in most antiperspirant/deodorants (nice gift Mom).  </li>
      <li>Pleasant smell, no sting, and no sticky tacky mess.  </li>
      <li>after using different products so far this is the best I have, I sweat a lot and this product seems to finally do the trick</li>
      <li>I also felt left out on the great smells other guys got to enjoy.  </li>
      <li>First...</li>
      <li>When I first put it on and walked by her she said, \\&quot;Oh</li>
      <li>Problem is it seems like they don&#x27;t make too much of it or the stores don&#x27;t carry it!</li>
      <li>Very affordable</li>
      <li>then others since I sweat so much.</li>
      <li>and it really DOES NOT have a manly smell.</li>
      <li>Works really well, both for morning application and PM applications (as instructed).</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
      <li>Thanks Dove.  </li>
      <li>You really notice the difference if you go a day without it.</li>
      <li>This stuff absolutely stops the underarm wetness.  </li>
      <li>I went to the doctor and got some real prescription deodorant.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It works well, I don&#x27;t sweat as much, but</li>
      <li>Was she just being thoughtful because I work outside in the heat all day or is she trying to tell me something....?</li>
      <li>That became a problem by the time I entered high school because the protection wasn&#x27;t strong enough to defeat my manly sweat and order.  </li>
      <li>During my youth I got decent results from regular strength fragrance free hypo-allergic anti-perspirants (Thank you ALMAY).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had trouble finding a clinical strength deodorant for my boyfriend that didn&#x27;t have a super strong smell.</li>
      <li>This deodorant covers up daily BO amazingly, but strangely it does not stop me from sweating.</li>
      <li>mother discovered  Dove Men + Care Clinical Protection Anti-perspirant Deodorant Solid, Clean Comfort, via an online advertisement targeted for semi/pro athletes.</li>
      <li>I only have to apply this product once a day to achieve full  protection from sweat and stink from morning  until night.  </li>
      <li>Unless you&#x27;re still in middle school using Axe body spray because you think it&#x27;s cool to have an obnoxious cloud of odor surrounding you and making you smell like a lumberjack or spice cabinet, you&#x27;ll appreciate this one.  </li>
      <li>&quot; I told her it was the new deodorant SHE bought me!</li>
      <li>I have used better antiperspirants, in fact, I sweat less under my arms when using the non-men version of Dove&#x27;s clinical protection deodorant or with a normal daytime deodorant.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to anyone with this problem.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this as an alternative to the discontinued SureMax.</li>
      <li>I keep it on my counter top, and every time I lift it to use, there is a round ring of greasy stuff under it, and you can wipe the bottom of the dispenser with a paper towel and see that this is where it is coming</li>
      <li>I will have massive amounts of sweat on my under arms, but it smells laundry fresh.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, or even if you don&#x27;t are are just looking for a powerful anti-perspirant, this is the last one you&#x27;ll ever need to buy.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and have tried all kinds of deodorants to find one that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my underarm.</li>
      <li>my husband had a hard time finding a deorderant/anti persperant that did not cause redness, this one works better that mitchum, or any of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; one on the market</li>
      <li>Okay yes... common sense...</li>
      <li>However, the smell reminds me of an old cosmetic or something that I would find in my grandmother&#x27;s bathroom.</li>
      <li>I would recommend Old Spice or Gillette.</li>
      <li>wow.</li>
      <li>Just picked up some Old Spice Wolfthorn today.</li>
      <li>Second, often times in shipping, the product gets jostled around and starts to seep out of the top unevenly.</li>
      <li>In my line of work, medicine, we have antibiotics that target very specific things, antibiotics that have pretty broad coverage, and a few terminator antibiotics that just pretty much kill everything indiscriminately and with no regard for civilian casualties.</li>
      <li>Works very well and it keeps me dry.</li>
      <li>Like most Dove products for men, I think it&#x27;s weak</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for a while now, as I have sensitive skin and regular deodorants irritate me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not just a little bit better than the typical antiperspirant -- it&#x27;s a night and day difference.  </li>

<li> However, I really have a difficult time getting the product out.  </li>
<li> Good-bye to the multiple bathroom stops just to reapply anti-perspirant/deodorant to slow down the attack from my glands.&lt;br</li>
<li> One remedy for me has been to turn it upside down with the lid on and hit it on counter.</li>
<li> but sadly it feels like youre not getting so much bang for your buck because of the really small size</li>
<li> Put it on and it will stick around for a few days, get rid of all perspiration and odor, and make you forget that it was ever a problem.</li>
<li> It has been a while since I have found a deodorant that hasn&#x27;t annoyed me, I have finally found it with Dove Men + Care</li>
<li> I&#x27;m gonna finish the Dove because it&#x27;s not cheap.</li>
<li> In fact, once it&#x27;s applied, it has very little odor at all, so it&#x27;s not going to clash with a cologne.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product was okay. Very affordable and I like that it came in a package of two. That made it more worth it.</li>
    <li> Works very well and it keeps me dry. I&#x27;m not in love with the scent but this deodorant works better for me then others since I sweat so much.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is great for men with sensitive skin. My husband has trouble using deodorants as a whole and he can use this one with no problem.</li>
    <li> I have used better antiperspirants, in fact, I sweat less under my arms when using the non-men version of Dove&#x27;s clinical protection deodorant or with a normal daytime deodorant. Keep in mind that you put on this deodorant at night, so if you don&#x27;t sleep with your arms by your side, you get deodorant on your sheets.     The good thing about this is that it works as a really good moisturizer and the smell is weak and pleasant.    But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, it lets me sweat too much and is messy when sleeping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a while now, as I have sensitive skin and regular deodorants irritate me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well, I don&#x27;t sweat as much, but the dispenser it comes in \\&quot;leaks\\&quot;. How to I describe this... I keep it on my counter top, and every time I lift it to use, there is a round ring of greasy stuff under it, and you can wipe the bottom of the dispenser with a paper towel and see that this is where it is coming from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even find a link on Dove&#x27;s website to ask if I am doing something wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is in my bathroom, not exposed to sun, or extreme heat or cold. If it didn&#x27;t leak, I would give it 4 stars, but because of it, only 3 stars. I would give it 5 starts if it wasn&#x27;t so pricey compared to regular, scented sticks.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and have tried all kinds of deodorants to find one that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my underarm. This product is the one! From day one when I started using it I was dry all day long, and over a month later I still have no irritation of my skin. If you have sensitive skin, or even if you don&#x27;t are are just looking for a powerful anti-perspirant, this is the last one you&#x27;ll ever need to buy. One lasts just about 1.5 months with daily use, so this two pack would last you just about 3 months. Now all I want is Amazon to put this on subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> my husband had a hard time finding a deorderant/anti persperant that did not cause redness, this one works better that mitchum, or any of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; one on the market</li>
    <li> The best product for excessive sweating i have used. I will continue to use it probably forever because it works and smells good. You really notice the difference if you go a day without it. Highly recommend to anyone with this problem.</li>
    <li> The following review is from my son for whom I purchased this product.&lt;br /&gt;_____________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother discovered  Dove Men + Care Clinical Protection Anti-perspirant Deodorant Solid, Clean Comfort, via an online advertisement targeted for semi/pro athletes. Good looking out Mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally! A product that gives MEN all day maximum protection from sweat and stink but does not cause rashes or boils to develop in the armpits.  AND it has a nice smell.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for 3 months.  I only have to apply this product once a day to achieve full  protection from sweat and stink from morning  until night.  Okay yes... common sense... after a game or workout I shower and reapply.  But that&#x27;s it.  Good-bye to the multiple bathroom stops just to reapply anti-perspirant/deodorant to slow down the attack from my glands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an athletic male that is severely allergic to fragrances and many other ingredients found in most antiperspirant/deodorants (nice gift Mom).  During my youth I got decent results from regular strength fragrance free hypo-allergic anti-perspirants (Thank you ALMAY).  However, the products were designed for women.  That became a problem by the time I entered high school because the protection wasn&#x27;t strong enough to defeat my manly sweat and order.  I also felt left out on the great smells other guys got to enjoy.  For me the perspiration and body-order got worst when I entered the corporate work force (stress) and joined the American two hour commute in bumper-to-bumper traffic (anguish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I began using Dove Men + Care Clinical Protection Anti-perspirant Deodorant Solid I&#x27;m more relaxed in crowded spaces, I lift my arms with confidence, and don&#x27;t hesitate to remove my jacket.  Oh yeah - so cool.  Thanks Dove.  Good looking out Mom.</li>
    <li> this stuff smells phenomenal but sadly it feels like youre not getting so much bang for your buck because of the really small size</li>
    <li> This highly effective deodorant, I have done very well with it, since I use it, I recommend it with confidence</li>
    <li> This deodorant covers up daily BO amazingly, but strangely it does not stop me from sweating. I will have massive amounts of sweat on my under arms, but it smells laundry fresh. So for that, I give it four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably need legitimate clinical strength from a Dr. (I sweat a lot.)</li>
    <li> More of a paste than a stick. I have found the twist mechanism doesn&#x27;t push the deodorant out evenly. The directions say two clicks, but sometimes you need 3 or 4 to get anything out. Once applied, it works like a charm. In my opinion, Right Guard Clinical works better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product multiple times and have had mixed experience. First... you have to be careful of the scent (sometimes they smell like &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; but if you get one of the clean comfort, etc., it smells much better). Second, often times in shipping, the product gets jostled around and starts to seep out of the top unevenly. It starts to adjust itself as you use it, but I wish there was a better way to keep this from happening. Overall, the deodorant works great and leaves me feeling confident that I don&#x27;t smell or have sweat marks on my underarms!</li>
    <li> In my line of work, medicine, we have antibiotics that target very specific things, antibiotics that have pretty broad coverage, and a few terminator antibiotics that just pretty much kill everything indiscriminately and with no regard for civilian casualties. This deodorant is the Stopper -- Put it on and it will stick around for a few days, get rid of all perspiration and odor, and make you forget that it was ever a problem. It&#x27;s like having a personal assistant for your armpits.</li>
    <li> I know it has to be used at night before going to bed for proper results but it works too using it on the go. I state this because the Gillette one don&#x27;t work well if not used at night. Very satisfied with the product but i hope they can offer a bigger version.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble finding a clinical strength deodorant for my boyfriend that didn&#x27;t have a super strong smell. I can&#x27;t smell that he is wearing this and he said it is working great!</li>
    <li> I asked my wife to pick me up some deodorant while she was at the store. She came back with this. CLINICAL?? Was she just being thoughtful because I work outside in the heat all day or is she trying to tell me something....? Either way, this stuff smells like fresh cat litter or maybe baby powder. My wife didn&#x27;t smell it before she bought it but she thinks it smells like some kind of bug spray! When I first put it on and walked by her she said, \\&quot;Oh wow. What IS that?\\&quot; I told her it was the new deodorant SHE bought me! She just laughed. A lot.(Thanks, babe). Like most Dove products for men, I think it&#x27;s weak and it really DOES NOT have a manly smell. I would recommend Old Spice or Gillette. Just picked up some Old Spice Wolfthorn today. I&#x27;m gonna finish the Dove because it&#x27;s not cheap. I can&#x27;t wait to be done with it! What lesson did I learn? Guys, don&#x27;t let your wife pick your deodorant. You will end up smelling like her cat or a freshly cleaned baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
    <li> But worth every dime...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seals off underarm pores like the Iron Curtain.  Pleasant smell, no sting, and no sticky tacky mess.  Does not stain clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying everything on the market, this product is the best.</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to protect me as well as the other clinical strength anti-perspirants that I&#x27;ve tried. However, the smell reminds me of an old cosmetic or something that I would find in my grandmother&#x27;s bathroom. There is no joke intended there, I swear that this is the same scent. My girlfriend agrees, it smells like a grandmother. The smell is not overly strong, so it&#x27;s not a gigantic problem, just something to consider before buying. I would recommend smelling it at the store before ordering.</li>
    <li> This stuff absolutely stops the underarm wetness.  It&#x27;s not just a little bit better than the typical antiperspirant -- it&#x27;s a night and day difference.  This Clean Comfort has a light, clean smell -- not at all overpowering.  In fact, once it&#x27;s applied, it has very little odor at all, so it&#x27;s not going to clash with a cologne.  Unless you&#x27;re still in middle school using Axe body spray because you think it&#x27;s cool to have an obnoxious cloud of odor surrounding you and making you smell like a lumberjack or spice cabinet, you&#x27;ll appreciate this one.  If you want to odor-up, use a cologne (lightly).</li>
    <li> It has been a while since I have found a deodorant that hasn&#x27;t annoyed me, I have finally found it with Dove Men + Care Clinical Protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t appear to stain your shirts, and you&#x27;ll notice when you shower the next morning you have to scrub to get it off. I totally recommend it</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this and really liked the smell.  However, I really have a difficult time getting the product out.  There is a knob on the bottom you turn clockwise.  Seems like you have to turn at least 10 times to get product out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully they will be able to correct this design flaw.  One remedy for me has been to turn it upside down with the lid on and hit it on counter.</li>
    <li> after using different products so far this is the best I have, I sweat a lot and this product seems to finally do the trick</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t really work for me. I went to the doctor and got some real prescription deodorant. Ask your doctor for some! It&#x27;s cheap, but you need a doctors note. The limit the amount of the solution for over the counter deodorants such as this.</li>
    <li> If you sweat a lot and you want to control it or even get rid of it this anti perspirant works like a charm when you apply it before you go to bed. And the best thing it lasts throughout the entire day even if it is hot or humid outside</li>
    <li> This deodorant doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent to it so it won&#x27;t bother your skin or if you have sensitivity to strong scents. Works really well, both for morning application and PM applications (as instructed). Highly recommend this as an alternative to the discontinued SureMax.</li>
    <li> My body built up resistance to every other deodorant I had tried.  This one rocks!  Give it a shot - it&#x27;s AMAZON prime! LOL</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like super strong, perfumey smelling deodorant so I need to point that out. I got a samples of this at a car show and I was hooked. It actually works! Problem is it seems like they don&#x27;t make too much of it or the stores don&#x27;t carry it! I had to order deodorant from Amazon! Who does that? Well it&#x27;s worth it if you like a clean smell and no sweat !</li>
    <li> This is my favorite under arm deodorant, but is difficult to find in the stores and seems to be a bit overpriced for the size of the applicator</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good and at a great deal!  My personal Doctor recommended this product.</li>
    <li> Nothing I have found has been unstoppable but this is probably the best product I have found.</li>
    <li> Better than non clinical protection.  I still have sweating or \\&quot;pit-outs\\&quot; as some call them.  It does help though and keeps you smelling fresh.</li>
</ol>
