      <li>Price was right as well!</li>
      <li>Great product for applying my lashes also came sooner then expected</li>
      <li>Use this all the time and it really helps to put the lashes on with a bit more precision</li>
      <li>just to let you&#x27;ll know, she really does love that applicator</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for positioning, but when you \\&quot;open\\&quot; the tweezer head to let go of the lash, mine get \\&quot;caught\\&quot; in the curl of the lash, and sometimes tugs the lash back</li>

      <li>This clip makes eyelash application much easier!  </li>
      <li>It makes lash application so much easier.  </li>
      <li>Works far better than tweezers or the wide, plastic applicators that come with some lashes.  </li>
      <li>The long arm on the tip is good for pressing down the strip&#x27;s corners better.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am a professional make up artist and using these makes putting strip lashes on so much quicker and easier</li>
      <li>I got these along with my new lashes having no clue how to use either.</li>
      <li>the positive, it has no sharp corners, so it beats me poking myself in the eye with the regular tweezers.</li>
      <li>Thanks, but no thanks.</li>
      <li>These lash tweezers allow me to barely have to use my fingers to get that curve of my lid.</li>
      <li>There has got to be a better way to get false eyelashes on, but I haven&#x27;t found it yet.</li>

    <li> I love it!! and since its metal I can widen it so that I can pick up lashes, I LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Great product for applying my lashes also came sooner then expected also came in a cute clear case a must have I will never use my fingers to apply my lashes again ......... Lilly</li>
    <li> I used this applicator one time and it was hard to handle and apply my lashes.Needed to have came with a tutorial or a instruction bookley (LOL) So I am going back to my tweezers</li>
    <li> Kinda seems like it needs to be a bit more open, with a touch more tension. Maybe I&#x27;ll try bending them. It&#x27;s good for positioning, but when you \\&quot;open\\&quot; the tweezer head to let go of the lash, mine get \\&quot;caught\\&quot; in the curl of the lash, and sometimes tugs the lash back off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the positive, it has no sharp corners, so it beats me poking myself in the eye with the regular tweezers. The long arm on the tip is good for pressing down the strip&#x27;s corners better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*edit* I bent the tool \\&quot;open\\&quot; more, and it really seemed to help.</li>
    <li> The product is a little light and doesn&#x27;t clamp down as firm as I&#x27;d like it to but it does the job. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it though and definitely wouldn&#x27;t re-buy.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist so I have applied many pairs of lashes.This little tool makes it so much easier.It makes for a perfect application every time.</li>

    <li> just to let you&#x27;ll know, she really does love that applicator, it&#x27;s a good idea and I&#x27;m glad you showed it to me. Thank You...</li>
    <li> i mean like i guess it does its job.. well i guess it all depends on the eye lash glue</li>
    <li> This is great and easy to use helps a lot to put your lashes on! Soon I will be able to do my own all the time and that will save money and time!</li>
    <li> Very cheap but I could not find this practical and use it.. I did not use it not even once. Not too practical since it is not top quality.</li>
    <li> maybe im using it wrong but i CANT put on these lashes with this thing! u can tell how cheap the quality is because the metal is light and cant be bent without much force</li>
    <li> Works good and I would purchase some more soon they are a Great tool to use you shound try it out</li>
    <li> I got these along with my new lashes having no clue how to use either. Luckily for me, these made applying lashes a breeze! I can pop lashes on faster than I can apply mascara now. And the big bonus... no pointy parts to terrify first time lash users :)</li>
    <li> Love it, works great on clients! It makes lashes super easy to apply. perfect to get multiple at this price point too</li>
    <li> I found tweezers easier to apply the fake eyelashes with than this eyelash applicator.  I probably need to just keep practicing.</li>
    <li> This clip makes eyelash application much easier!  If you wear lashes, you HAVE to get this tool!  Works far better than tweezers or the wide, plastic applicators that come with some lashes.  Price was right as well!</li>
    <li> Before buying this product I used regular tweezers to grip the lashes and apply them, then I would use my fingers to press the lashes against the curve of my eyelid.  I was not very good at using my fingers carefully!  These lash tweezers allow me to barely have to use my fingers to get that curve of my lid. I love the product.</li>
    <li> was the producuto I wanted and arrive on time</li>
    <li> The product is a little light and doesn&#x27;t clamp down as firm as i&#x27;d like it to but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Use this all the time and it really helps to put the lashes on with a bit more precision</li>
    <li> This design is so superior to all the other faux eyelash applicators in the stores.  The part that holds the lash is just the right size for the lash but not so large as to obstruct your vision during application.  The quality is excellent and the price so inexpensive.  It makes lash application so much easier.  If this wonderful little device ever makes it to retail stores, there will be many more faux eyelash users!</li>
    <li> these make putting lashes on so quick and easy! I now have 4 or so pairs of these floating around! I am a professional make up artist and using these makes putting strip lashes on so much quicker and easier getting those big clumsy fingers out of the way! plus at this price, really can&#x27;t go wrong! (it does take a while to come in the mail, so if you&#x27;re in  a hurry not the best option)</li>
    <li> But it could be great with a little more effort in the designing of the product. Thanks, but no thanks.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this tool helpful at all. There has got to be a better way to get false eyelashes on, but I haven&#x27;t found it yet. This was not the answer for me...</li>
    <li> Chose this bc I just can&#x27;t put on false eyelashes. Looks as if it will help me in that area. Nice solid piece.</li>
    <li> It looks like its useful as well as helpful but still haven&#x27;t put it to use yet. Will do a future review.</li>
    <li> I wasnt really happy about this product because it was too small to hold on to the eyelash.. It was a little hard to get the eyelash with it too. It cheap with is good, so im not too mad about this product.</li>
