    <li> Love the scent great price</li>
    <li> My husband loves the smell as much as I.</li>
    <li> Skin So Soft is a tried and true product.  Been used in my family for years.  The key is to use it after a shower - it seals in moisture and adds shine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and also a good bug repellent</li>
    <li> Best soap scum cleaner ever! Dissolves that stuff fast. Shines faucets, shined my marble. Going to use it to polish my stainless steel sink next.</li>
    <li> Beautiful smell and great for softening skin.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and the price for two was awesome! Gotta get me some more</li>
    <li> I ordered the soft and Sensual but you sent me the original green ones.  I didn&#x27;t want to risk loosing my money if I sent them back so I just gave them away as gifts. I don&#x27;t know if you were just trying to get rid of them or if it were an honest mistake. Soft and Sensual is the only one I like or use or buy. I guess next time I will get t directly from Avon.</li>
    <li> Nice Scent.  My family uses Skin So Soft in the summer time to ward off the bugs.  It keeps our skin nice an soft too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 7 years now.  My skin is so smooth and I smell great from shower to sundown.  I sometimes use it just as a moisturizer after shower and sometimes in my bath.  Either way, moisture stays in.</li>
    <li> Great price! Love skin so soft bath oil. This just isn&#x27;t the one that I was looking for. I was looking for the original.</li>
    <li> This goes into my daily bath and Makes my skin stay soft and comfortable.I am happy with skin so soft and have used it for years.</li>
    <li> This keeps the bugs away as well as the original and it smells better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Avon products and Ibjust purchased two large bottles of the Skin So Soft Oil. I absolutely love the feel and smell.</li>

    <li> Products arrived in excellent condition. My daughters have sensitive skin and are able to use this product.The fragrance is very nice. Look forward to my next purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered the soft and sensual, but received the original fragrance. I do love the bath oils, though. Super skin softening.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this for me and herself. I was pleasantly surprised... I usually dislike flowery scents, but this is so light and lovely...</li>
    <li> Always a good product!!  Use it often.</li>
    <li> I have loved this for years and for a while Avon replaced it with another scent that was ok, but not like this. The original is good, but this scent is light and super feminine. The oil isn&#x27;t greasy and makes my legs feel like silk.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully for dry skin. Nice smell.</li>
    <li> SERVICE WAS GREAT, LOVE THE SMELL WILL BUY FROM AGAIN THANKS FOR THE GREAT STUFF</li>
    <li> I have been using skin so soft for many years.  It is a fine product, great for moisturizing the skin.</li>
    <li> I received this item 2 days after I ordered it! It was packaged well, and TWO 16 oz. bottles...you cannot beat the price! I&#x27;ve been in love with this stuff forever. The soft and sensual has an amazing fragrance that lasts, and moisture that cant be beat.</li>
    <li> Great as an after shower oil. I put it in a spray bottle and it goes on a lot quicker and smoother than a lotion. I like the smell of jasmine, but this isn&#x27;t going to be as overpowering as a perfume.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time. I try to stock up on this because it is hard to find. Love the scent!</li>
    <li> love this smell always #1</li>
    <li> My home is backed by woods so I use this to repel mosquitos by spraying it on fake flowers. It makes adds nice smelling decoration to the table and lasts several rains</li>
    <li> This is a great price for the SSS product.  Love the smell. I do not have a person that sells avon around me.  I will diffenitly order again.</li>
