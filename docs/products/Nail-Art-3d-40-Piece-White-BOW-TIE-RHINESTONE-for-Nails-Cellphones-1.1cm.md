<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Their nice but I only got 10 &amp; there were supposed to b 40</li>
    <li> its a bit large but that&#x27;s not really anyone&#x27;s fault so overall its great.</li>
    <li> I like it , but are a little big and thick, but its ok , may be some one extravagant will loves it,</li>
    <li> i put original crazy glue to make it stay and it stays so good. I do hair and it doesnt even come off</li>
    <li> These nail bows are very cute, they came earlier than the arrival day which is great. I would recommend this to a friend, and i will defiantly buy more. :D</li>
    <li> You can put these anywhere, even the big toe. The rhinestone is very sturdy to my surprise. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> nice for nail art designs, can&#x27;t wait to use them thanks for shipping them on time!!! going to have some very happy clients!!</li>
    <li> My nails are quite long and they were still too big and they are not flat they stick out way to much and get caught on things. Not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I wish it came with more bows. It looks better in picture. I have not used them yet to know the beauty.</li>
    <li> So beautiful angelic for n ail art. I make sheek and sheer nails everytime with these sophistacted bows.</li>
    <li> They are pretty big, bigger than expected, but they are nice regardless and can&#x27;t wait to use them on my nails!</li>
    <li> these are very cute i can&#x27;t wait to use them i just wish that it came more in the package</li>
    <li> I loveee these bows! I have skinny and long nail beds and i was afraid these bows would be too big but they&#x27;re the perfect size! I got compliments on my nails instantly!</li>
    <li> Omg these bows are so cute,I originally got them to match it with the nail color from the Tiffany box&lt;br /&gt;So my acrylic nails look like a gift,these are perfect totally cute  and I will be purchasing. More soon,they came in very quick and had no issues</li>
    <li> One of the bulbs came.in broken we tried to buy a new one but it didnt work everything else was in good shape ;-)</li>
    <li> They look kind of big, I thought they were going to be a bit smaller. I had intended to use this for my nails, but since they are so big I just don&#x27;t know anymore. I think it will be very hard to make them stay on your nails one week much less a week or two.</li>
    <li> These have so many different functions and they are so cute. Kind of endless on the potential scale. I enjoy using them/.</li>
    <li> These are hard bows that do not lay on your nail bed easily.  They stick up so far that they catch on everything.  They are just a little too much for me.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that these were sticker like designs or less bulky. I am not sure how people wear these on their nails they are heavy and don&#x27;t stick longer then 20 minutes with your standard nail glue. I gave them two stars though because I ended up using them for bows on small dolls that I made..so made for a cute addition to art project.</li>
    <li> I like these little bows, too cute! Can&#x27;t wait to use these when I do my nails, using my image plates and nail art; or all by themselves because they are just that cute. The price and shipping were more than reasonable. What made this even nicer was that the seller put in a little gift of those french tip guide stickers.</li>
    <li> I really like them they work great</li>
    <li> Cute, but way to big to put on nails..</li>
    <li> They are a little big for my nail but i actually love them i sont care about the size i just know ima be using them alot.</li>
    <li> The shipping took as long as they said it would, and the product came as pictured. The size of them is good.  I got all 40 bows, plus an extra rhinestone, so if one of them goes missing I have a replacement.</li>
    <li> thought they would be smaller they are way too big for a finger nail.. would be cute on something other than your nails.</li>
    <li> Cute but comes off easily.</li>
    <li> It is pretty but doesn&#x27;t stay on well</li>
    <li> This is a good item for nails and its a good size. some of the bows were missing gems but its nothing more gems and super glue cant fix. Love the amount and love the price.</li>
    <li> They are the right size and the white color goes with everything. Will order some more for myself and up and coming nail artist that I know.</li>
    <li> i choosed this rating because it is so faboo.i would recomend this prod. to my best friend because she is a nail art freak.</li>
    <li> Just got them.. alot smaller than i thought be very happy with the product. Plan on using them soon.. Love nailart..</li>
    <li> Great but one of the bows lost a diamond&lt;br /&gt;and that is the only reason I gave it 4 stars</li>
    <li> The bow ties have a nice finish. However, they are too big for nail work. They are almost as wide as my nail.</li>
    <li> is ok is not much of it but is worth the money u pay for this thanks for sending it early then the date u say.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty bow but way to large to put it on the nail will have to see what else this can be used for !</li>
    <li> They are so cute and perfect for nails. They came on time and it was great. There were two made wrong. They were stuck together side by side. And some of the rhinestones werent put on straight, but they are awesome and stay on with a tad bit of nail glue. I love them a lot! I defifinitely suggest them. They came in a little baggie and they are the perfect size.</li>
    <li> Love them. They  are the cutest things in the world . Im going to put them on with nail glue because theyre light yet heavy.</li>
    <li> they are very big for my nails I havent been able to find nice small 3d art that is not huge and looks ridiculous on my nails</li>
    <li> The bows are to big I have small hands and the bow looks huge on my nails I didn&#x27;t like the product</li>
    <li> I was really satisfied with this purchase. As you can see they are very cute and they arrived on time in a little plastic baggy. They are also pretty cheap :)</li>
    <li> I actually got these nail bows much more quickly than I expected. About a 2 week wait? Anyways, they did turn out a bit larger and flatter than I had wanted. Luckily, my thumb is retardedly fat so at least one of my fingers can use it (or else I would have rated it a 4.) The person gave a free gift with it too so that was a plus!</li>
    <li> I recently started doing acrylics . I love how cheap they were . they came from china and only took about 2 weeks to get here. They are easy to apply with just a dab of acrylic on a brush and hold it on. They&#x27;re elegant and pretty. But they are KIND OF big .</li>
    <li> great true to color...good quality - highly recommend! fun and trendy - good gift ideas or just fun stocking stuffer!</li>
    <li> Loooove these bows, stands out and goes with any nail shape I get, affordable and they got here quick and there wer as many in the bags as it says. I sure will be reuping with this piece</li>
    <li> Cute and fun for most nail art designs.</li>
    <li> Beautiful Accent to add to your nail art. I usually only accent my ring finger. These have flat bottoms and of course our nails are not like that! make sure to add nail glue or top coat to keep the bow on your nail. (don&#x27;t touch anything for while till it dries!)</li>
    <li> Love the bows. They&#x27;re so cute and I&#x27;ve been getting many compliments too. Need more colors. Great price as well.</li>
    <li> when I got it- I noticed it was a bit off white- and it was a little to big for my taste</li>
    <li> These are so beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Good price and so cute with my toe&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;And enough to keep it those&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
    <li> These took about three weeks to deliver. When I got the package I didn&#x27;t think there could be 40 inside but there are, and they all look really nice. They&#x27;re also a perfect size, I was worried when other reviews said they were too big for nails. Of course the bottom is flat, so they wont sit perfectly but I think it will be fine. The price is really good and they&#x27;re adorable, so get them if you don&#x27;t mind waiting a little bit for them to get delivered :)</li>
    <li> No instructions included and no glue or application products included. A little large for applying to fingernails anyway. We used them as confetti.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as described and it met and surpassed my expectations. NO more words needed for me to say just a recommendation from me to you on your purchase of this item.</li>
    <li> I got these yesterday and had to use them right away! They&#x27;re absolutely perfect. I used my Seche Vite top coat as an adhesive and it&#x27;s worked perfectly!</li>
    <li> These arrived and they are adorable.  Only down side is when you do put them on they catch everything in your hair, anything your hands may handle on a daily basis only because they are not flat, to a certain extent otherwise they are beautiful.</li>
    <li> Purchased for DIL. She LOVED them. Actually a lot nicer than expected for the low price. Will order from the Seller Again when we need nail decorations!</li>
    <li> They are cute and little but they came kinda yellowish not happy with them.</li>
    <li> Just received them I can&#x27;t wait till I get to try them on my costumers and see them on the nail. They are a good size to work with and was shipped before the deadline. I love the way they were packaged and I will order again when needed. Thank you for doing a great job on getting them here. I can&#x27;t wait to see my next ones. I will order from you again. And I love the fact you have free shipping. Thank you so much</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! They are perfect. Just what i wanted, they aren&#x27;t overly huge. But if u have short nails they may seem a little big.</li>
    <li> Super cute lil bows.  They are pretty thick so when you wear em it&#x27;s easy to snag em on stuff.  I work a lot with my hands so mine only stayed on for a couple days, but hell, it came with 40pcs so I&#x27;m not too worried about it!</li>
    <li> YOU NEED TO AHVE LONG NAILS TO USE THIS BECAUSE IT IS BIG AND WILL TAKE UP A LOT OF SPACE ON A SMALL NAIL</li>
    <li> These bows are cute on my nails. I&#x27;ve been getting soo many compliments! The price was cheap which is an A+. Thanks alot!!</li>
    <li> These bows are so cute on your nails. The are a little big, so they really should be used on long nails but either way they are cute!</li>
    <li> FROM THE LOOKS OF IT, YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEY WERE A LITTLE BIGGER. BUT THEY ARE SO LITTLE, WHICH IS OKAY IF THATS WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR. I WONT BUY AGAIN. BUT THERE ARE A GOOD MATERIAL. JUST SMALL.</li>
    <li> Plain being white color but still pretty and works as expected. Although, the rhinestones do pop off easily.</li>
    <li> pretty love these nice when on fingers</li>
    <li> Way too big for nails...Not what I expected but I should have looked more closely at the measurements than the picture.</li>
    <li> Cute but a little bit bigger than I expected!!</li>
    <li> My little sister loved them :)</li>
    <li> These are really cute but they are huge, too big for natural nails and they are not flexible in the least.  I am going to try them on my feet but I still don&#x27;t think they will work. They are also fairly thick, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase them again.  Maybe if you have acrylic nails it would work better but I still think they are too big to stay on for long.</li>
    <li> Cute and all 40 was there but you have to wear them on acrylic or long nails in order to look right</li>
    <li> These are so beautiful and makes my product stand out even more I love these so much they are awesome!</li>
    <li> Cute actually what I expected!!!love to do my nails these work we&#x27;ll stay on with nail glue,will be ordering more in different colors!</li>
    <li> I think these little bows with rhinestones were so cute. I bought a pack and the bows look great in person too.</li>
    <li> I love my new nail art!!! It was just what I expected and looks even better on my nails! They arrived in a very timely manner...actually before the expected time. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> They were a little bigger than expected.</li>
    <li> Pieces were much too big for my nails and very thick</li>
    <li> Excellent quality product and arrived before estimated time of arrival! </li>
    <li> My daughter was thrilled!</li>
    <li> cute big good for fake nails not so much for real nails nicely packaged and can be used for phone case art etc&lt;br /&gt;three stars for this product not because its not great but because i probably wont use it, my fault not the seller or the product</li>
    <li> I thought the quality was terrible, good for the price i guess. Just not what i was expecting to get.</li>
    <li> Love them!!..I made a great choice:)</li>
    <li> The bows are very pretty and glued easily . The only thing is that they only sent 39. It&#x27;s not a big deal,  they were very cheap and I&#x27;ve even ordered more!</li>
    <li> Super cute!!! Arrived less than two weeks after i ordered them. There was exactly 40 which i was happy they didnt try to short me. A few of the bows had missing rhinestones which is why i gave them 4 stars. Mine didnt come discolored they are super bright white. Great buy!</li>
    <li> fun fir decorating nails. slightly smaller than circumference of a dime. look good on nails.</li>
    <li> love it! exactly what i expected and more</li>
    <li> These are a bit bulky and will be hard to glue on nails, but well worth the price; would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of &#x27;nail art&#x27; and with tremors, I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d be able to do it.  However, it&#x27;s easy and fun, especially, with products like yours!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> You get so many of them! Being white, they can be carefully painted any color, so I will definitely re-purchase!</li>
    <li> These bows are so cute I love how well they stay on and don&#x27;t snag because they lie flat on the nail bed</li>
    <li> These bows are Very flat on the back and not bendable so  I kind of just sits on the nail sometimes... Get a good amount for the price though</li>
    <li> Not what I expected! Too big</li>
    <li> There were a ton of these in the bag! They&#x27;re a little big for smaller fingers like mine, but they&#x27;re useful for my other craft projects as well.</li>
    <li> Love that it comes with so many and for a good price, perfect size and non of the diamonds in the middle came off!</li>
    <li> THEY ARE HUGE THEY CAN&#x27;T EVEN FIT ON MY THUMB!! !!!!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy them don&#x27;t fit an takes forever to get them total waste of money</li>
    <li> well my daughter  used them the are so cute  i have pics of here nails  but i wish i could show you  lol so cute</li>
    <li> Super cute! Just received them! Arrived very early and the best thing, you receive 40 pieces! Not one less! Very pleased, will buy again!</li>
    <li> Same thing as the other bows. You cant glue them on your nail because they are not round. They are flat. No nail is flat.</li>
    <li> Love these! They look awesome on your nails and last forever!</li>
    <li> they are soooo thick they stick up so far from your finer there is no way to keep them on!</li>
    <li> I love this new addition to my nail art collection.  I could not find anything like this in my area anywhere.  I would recommend these to anyone looking to &amp;#34;bling&amp;#34; up their nail art at an affordable price.  I received my items very quickly and am very happy with them. They are beautiful and I can&#x27;t wait to find something new and different to add to my wish list.  I am so happy....</li>
    <li> I gave it a star because they&#x27;re cute, but other than that.. They are too large to apply to your nails and the back of it is flat so it just hangs off your nail. There&#x27;s no instructions or glue provided but it was a dollar so yolo</li>
    <li> Thry were to thick and big</li>
    <li> Not white. Their cream</li>
    <li> Love! Perfect touch to my manicures. Very happy</li>
