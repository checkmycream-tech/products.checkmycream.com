<ol>
      <li>It feels wonderful going on my skin.  </li>
      <li>These products might work best when used together with the foaming</li>
      <li>Among products of this type, this is the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>This is a very good product for acne.</li>
      <li>you have oily skin, this should be an ideal product for you.</li>
      <li>So, it is great that this didn&#x27;t flare up her skin</li>
      <li>I will say it has a pleasant scent and caused no irritation on my skin.</li>
      <li>My wife has been using this and has been getting good results.  </li>
      <li>We had good results with it.</li>
      <li>This lotion is also good as a dual moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>My zits are gone and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>If you use this stuff, better invest in a nose clip, too!</li>
      <li>This is amazing.</li>
      <li>my whole life and nothing yet has blown me away as the perfect solution for my acne-prone skin.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a film or residue on the skin.</li>
      <li>my whole life and nothing yet has blown me away as the perfect solution for my acne-prone skin.  </li>
      <li>It does work very good to eliminate the redness and inflammation and gives fast results.</li>
      <li>Nice light moisturizer and acne treatment in one.  </li>
      <li>Lovely moisturizer for oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;Light texture&lt;br /&gt;Matte</li>
      <li>It has no added fragrance, so one or more of the ingredients is the culprit.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clearly a great alternative to ProActive like treatments at a more reasonable cost.</li>
      <li>and I seem to do better with them.</li>
      <li>I have more of combination skin.</li>
      <li>most things</li>
      <li>This product works best as a regimen for my moderate acne.  </li>
      <li>and I was able to use it once a day.  </li>
      <li>My skin got more used to it</li>
      <li>This is a good, light moisturizer with a mild dose of salicylic acid in the mix.</li>
      <li>With how the hydrator alone has been nice to my skin, though not given me any sort of &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; for the acne control, I may see about getting a trial pack of the Benzac in order to get a full review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If this stuff can keep my skin clear I&#x27;ll be a happy camper!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I found this moisturizer to be light and ok to apply to my oily, combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For a produce to act as a moisturizer and keep skin clear, this is great.</li>
      <li>It has a strong odor.</li>
      <li>Interesting, since I&#x27;m using this in combination with Dermalogica products - so my full face is getting hydrated from that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as quickly as an overnight or &amp;#34;spot treatment&amp;#34; would, of course, but it does work and the fact that it does sooth the skin and get rid of the redness and general irritation so quickly is a great benefit because that alone makes the skin look much better.</li>
      <li>The smell vanishes after about 5 minutes, so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>It seems to increase the skin cell turnover, which also helps with fine lines.</li>
      <li>I finally found something more amazing than Pro-Activ!  </li>
      <li>As an adult who deals with mild acne from time to time,  this product is great</li>
      <li>Benzac goes on smooth with a light scent.</li>
      <li>This is a light weight cream.  </li>
      <li>Benzac Blemish Clearing Hydrator goes on smoothly and works well under makeup.</li>
      <li>So I would imagine those with ongoing acne issues that the complete Benxac regimen is a good choice.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a mild,  fresh-feeling hydrate that has successfully kept pimples at bay and my skin clear.  </li>
      <li>It makes my face feel smooth and clean, it doesn&#x27;t add any weight or</li>
      <li>I think it would be best for someone with lots of small acne.  </li>
      <li>Same ingredients of most popular skin blemish systems - .5 % Salicylic Acid .</li>
      <li>The next day someone told me how nice and smooth my skin is!  </li>
      <li>Maybe the essential oil that it contains, but it doesn&#x27;t smell pleasant to me.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just nothing special.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll update this review if I find that using the full Benzac line is beneficial.continual search</li>
      <li>I really couldn&#x27;t ask for better results, except one caveat: this product promises to not be drying.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll update this review if I find that using the full Benzac line is beneficial.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The scent is actually very pleasant, at least to me</li>
      <li>The moisture level is lovely,  not heavy, and the lotion absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to clean your face with as long as you don&#x27;t overuse it.</li>
      <li>I decided to try this serum and liked it a little more, but not a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff not only works amazingly, it also smells so</li>
      <li>I thought this might be worth a try.</li>
      <li>This contains enough sallicylic acid to be effective, and attack acne.</li>
      <li>The pump dispenses just the right amount for my neck and face.</li>
      <li>Ideal for older acne prone skin, since it is less drying than straight benzoil peroxide.</li>
      <li>The really nice thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out while clearing up pimples/acne.</li>
      <li>This seems to be much more gentle on my sensitive skin though I did still get some dryness.</li>
      <li>This Benzac Blemish Clearing Hydrator is a very good moisturizer and does seem to work at controlling minor acne outbreaks, but does not do much to help with a larger outbreak.</li>
      <li>Over the period of the test, I did not have any new outbreaks on the right side and existing blemishes healed more quickly than those on the left.  </li>
      <li>Unlike many similar products, it does not irritate my skin or eyes, or leave a sticky layer on the skin.</li>
      <li>this worked pretty well for her, too.</li>
      <li>I will be buying more in the future!</li>
      <li>that reason, I very likely won&#x27;t be getting any more of it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It seems like the combination is working very well!</li>
      <li>This product did as well as the clean &#x27;n&#x27; clear that I had been using.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The clean &#x27;n&#x27; clear</li>
      <li>I also have large pores on either side of my nose which are prone to blackheads.</li>
      <li>My oldest daughter has sensitive skin and there are very few products that she can use on her face because they make her break out more, cause more redness and irritation and a rash-like texture.</li>
      <li>For the occasional blemish, it works fine.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything to reduce big huge zits.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also been using the Benzac spot treatment, which I don&#x27;t like as much as this hydrator.  </li>
      <li>I thought I would try this to see if it would work, but it did not do much.</li>
      <li>She has had problems with two so-called gentle products from Neutrogena, but this has not caused any irritation.</li>
      <li>Plus, while it smells a bit medicinal, it&#x27;s light enough to not be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyhow, I really like the Blemish Clearing Hydrator.</li>
      <li>You can see a difference in redness overnight and the pimples go away much faster than when using just a cleanser.</li>
      <li>But after that company changed its formula, rebranded and started charging way too much, I knew I had to switch.  </li>
      <li>If it didn&#x27;t smell at all or had a nicer smell, I would probably keep using, but nobody wants their face to smell like that.</li>
      <li>I have had acne my whole life -</li>
      <li>It is a nice product to add to your regimen to keep acne away and to treat existing acne without being to harsh on the skin nd without any dryness.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This has a low .5% salicylic Acid which is used more for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>And the smell is heavenly, especially considered to the original proactiv formula.  </li>
      <li>You can buy each item separately if your find you use more of one than the other, but save a bit if you buy the three part regimen.  </li>
      <li>and it helped the overall appearance of her skin to just look better in general.</li>
      <li>Having skin that is too dry can cause acne just as easily as having skin that is to oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use it even on the dry areas of my face and neck and they are fine.</li>
      <li>I think the overall effect would probably be even stronger if I used the full regime of products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>never bad enough to go to a dermatologist</li>
      <li>A decent cleanser that seems to do</li>
      <li>Nonirritating and simple to use for mild breakouts.  </li>
      <li>It definitely eliminated the severe redness and soreness quickly.</li>
      <li>On the positive side, it leave skin soft and touchable.    </li>
      <li>This is normal for me, though.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I tried this lotion out for about a week.  My skin feels moisturized without feeling oily, and it does appear that blackheads on my nose and forehead are smaller.  My skin also seems to get less oily throughout the day.  I think the overall effect would probably be even stronger if I used the full regime of products.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any of the dryness / chaffing the other reviewers here mention.  But overall I give it a thumbs up!</li>
    <li> YOU GUYS!! I finally found something more amazing than Pro-Activ!  This stuff not only works amazingly, it also smells so yummy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used proactiv for YEARS, despite the horrible sulfer smell, it was the only thing that worked.  But after that company changed its formula, rebranded and started charging way too much, I knew I had to switch.  I tried everything under the sun.  But then I got this pretty much a day after I broke out badly, and overnight everything was reduced by at least 50%.  The next day someone told me how nice and smooth my skin is!  And the smell is heavenly, especially considered to the original proactiv formula.  This is amazing. you should give it a try. I will be buying more in the future!</li>
    <li> Lovely moisturizer for oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;Light texture&lt;br /&gt;Matte finish&lt;br /&gt;Contains low dose salycylic acid 0.5%&lt;br /&gt;The Second ingredient is actually lemon myrtle which is supposed to have skin calming properties.&lt;br /&gt;Sandalwood oil is low on the ingredient list, but it does provide a very delicate fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
    <li> Despite being old, I still get pimples. I usually use Retin-a, but even it doesn&#x27;t keep me from always having a pimple or two. I thought this might be worth a try. When I started using it, I stopped the REtin-a so I would only be testing the Benzac, After about three days, I broke out horribly. I assume that this was because I stopped the Retin-a, although I&#x27;ve never, ever been so badly broken out before. My skin was slow to settle down, so after a couple of weeks I went back to the Retin-a but kept using the Benzac as well. ALL the pimples dried up, and no new ones have formed. It seems like the combination is working very well! If this stuff can keep my skin clear I&#x27;ll be a happy camper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is not drying- I use it even on the dry areas of my face and neck and they are fine. It seems to increase the skin cell turnover, which also helps with fine lines. The pump dispenses just the right amount for my neck and face. The one annoying thing is that I don&#x27;t like the smell, but then I&#x27;ve used other salicylic acid products and they smelled worse- sal acid just plain doesn&#x27;t smell good and apparently the smell is hard to mask. The smell vanishes after about 5 minutes, so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> First, this is the only element of the Benzac &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34; that I have, so I can&#x27;t comment as to how it works with the cleanser.  I found that at first this really dried out my face (but it is winter in Chicago, so it was dry to begin with), so I used it every other day at night.  My skin got more used to it and I was able to use it once a day.  What I like about it is that it is so non-greasy feeling or looking. What I couldn&#x27;t deal with is the smell of it. It smells very medicine-y and the smell is really potent, so it annoyed me when I&#x27;d go to bed to have to breathe in that awful smell.  It didn&#x27;t create results for me that were good enough to outweigh the smell - my skin didn&#x27;t really clear up, nor did it get worse. If it didn&#x27;t smell at all or had a nicer smell, I would probably keep using, but nobody wants their face to smell like that.</li>
    <li> Benzac Blemish Clearing Hydrator is a solid product. It does what it says it will do - moisturize acne prone skin without causing breakouts. I like the product. I only use the hydrator in this series but, I used it in conjunction with other acne products. I found this moisturizer to be light and ok to apply to my oily, combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Benzac Blemish Clearing Hydrator goes on smoothly and works well under makeup. Plus, while it smells a bit medicinal, it&#x27;s light enough to not be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone with acne prone skin that needs a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This product works best as a regimen for my moderate acne.  My zits are gone and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I have zits pretty regularly only since my 30s.  I always use moisturizer with sunscreen, and I put it on at night.  I used this in the morning, as well as and not instead of, the moisturizer.  This is moisturizer with a little bit of salysilic acid.  I don&#x27;t like salysilic acid face cleaners because they dry out my skin and irritate it and make things worse.  This moisturizer didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and seemed to reduce smaller acne.  It didn&#x27;t do anything to reduce big huge zits.  I think it would be best for someone with lots of small acne.  Overall, if this weren&#x27;t so expensive, I&#x27;d think about making it part of my routine.</li>
    <li> This is a light weight cream.  It feels wonderful going on my skin.  Almost like my face soaks it in.  It makes my face feel smooth and clean, it doesn&#x27;t add any weight or greasiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve still had small breakouts here and there while using this.  I&#x27;ve also been using the Benzac spot treatment, which I don&#x27;t like as much as this hydrator.  These products might work best when used together with the foaming cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I like this hydrator and I like how it makes my face feel.</li>
    <li> Same ingredients of most popular skin blemish systems - .5 % Salicylic Acid . Works as well as expected.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product for acne. The really nice thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out while clearing up pimples/acne. It does work very good to eliminate the redness and inflammation and gives fast results. You can see a difference in redness overnight and the pimples go away much faster than when using just a cleanser. My oldest daughter has sensitive skin and there are very few products that she can use on her face because they make her break out more, cause more redness and irritation and a rash-like texture. She had no problems using this and it helped the overall appearance of her skin to just look better in general. Acne products are particularly difficult for her to use since they usually cause more irritation to her skin than a cleanser or moisturizer, etc. So, it is great that this didn&#x27;t flare up her skin and it actually worked to clear up the irritation from acne and pimples. It absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a film or residue on the skin. We had good results with it. My youngest daughter tends to get larger boil type &amp;#34;under the skin&amp;#34; pimples/acne and this worked pretty well for her, too. It definitely eliminated the severe redness and soreness quickly. It doesn&#x27;t work as quickly as an overnight or &amp;#34;spot treatment&amp;#34; would, of course, but it does work and the fact that it does sooth the skin and get rid of the redness and general irritation so quickly is a great benefit because that alone makes the skin look much better. It is a nice product to add to your regimen to keep acne away and to treat existing acne without being to harsh on the skin nd without any dryness.</li>
    <li> Nice light moisturizer and acne treatment in one.  Nonirritating and simple to use for mild breakouts.  Ideal for older acne prone skin, since it is less drying than straight benzoil peroxide.</li>
    <li> I have tried the wash from this line and was not impressed. I decided to try this serum and liked it a little more, but not a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a low .5% salicylic Acid which is used more for sensitive skin. I have more of combination skin. A lot of other brands out there have 2% salicylic acid and I seem to do better with them. I thought I would try this to see if it would work, but it did not do much. I will say it has a pleasant scent and caused no irritation on my skin. However, it just was not strong enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been weeks since I received this and I used it for about two weeks and I have since been to a dermatologist that prescribes me a night serum that cost over $400 that keeps my skin clear. I don’t think I would go back to no prescribed skin care now. However, if you have sensitive skin, this might be for you but was not for my skin type.</li>
    <li> Benzac dries the blemish just enough but not too much to cause my sensitive skin to get red.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product to help me with the outbreaks I&#x27;ve been having on my nose, cheeks and chin area and was hoping this product from Benzac would do the trick. But we&#x27;ll never know because after washing my face well as instructed on the label of this Blemish Clearing Hydrator, I squirted out some of this stuff to rub on my face and...oh my God, what is that putrid smell? As soon as I put it on, my eyes started watering and it smelled like a cross between ammonia and a powdery-smelling perfume (which I abhor!). I gave it a go for about 10 minutes and then couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and had to wash it off. This product is perhaps one of the worst facial creams I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of them. I can&#x27;t tell you whether it actually dries up breakouts or not because I couldn&#x27;t last long enough to find out. If you use this stuff, better invest in a nose clip, too!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this product, as I have a very unfortunate and long history with adult acne, particularly on my upper chest, arms, and shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an attempt to perform as reasonable a test as possible, I used this on my right side only for ten days and used nothing on the left.  I applied immediately after showering each day.  Over the period of the test, I did not have any new outbreaks on the right side and existing blemishes healed more quickly than those on the left.  It definitely seemed to help, which is new for me--most things don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have about this is that it comes in such a small bottle that covering any reasonable amount of skin empties it in no time.</li>
    <li> As an adult who deals with mild acne from time to time,  this product is great (I can&#x27;t speak for its efficacy in regards to severe acne, sorry). It&#x27;s a mild,  fresh-feeling hydrate that has successfully kept pimples at bay and my skin clear.  The moisture level is lovely,  not heavy, and the lotion absorbs quickly. For a produce to act as a moisturizer and keep skin clear, this is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my forties so acne is not much of an issue, but I do get an occasional pimple with stress, sweat or certain foods etc.  In the past month, I had two.  One near beard growth and another on my back.  I used the Benaz cleanser on the areas and then applied the spot treatment.  Both were gone by the next day.  I only needed one application.  So I would imagine those with ongoing acne issues that the complete Benxac regimen is a good choice.  There was no discomfort or drying feeling and the treatment is not visible.  Not much was needed to clear my problem areas  This lotion is also good as a dual moisturizer.  You can buy each item separately if your find you use more of one than the other, but save a bit if you buy the three part regimen.  It&#x27;s clearly a great alternative to ProActive like treatments at a more reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> As with most blemish fighting products, do expect a little dryness and maybe (if overused) some very minor peeling. And, as is customary, do try to begin using it every other day (or even every third day if your skin is already a little dry) and then increase the frequency of use incrementally. While there is a smell that might seem slightly off-putting, the results more than compensate for any initial discomfort. On the positive side, it leave skin soft and touchable.    Now, it is a little pricy. But, if less expensive products have seemed to fail, this might be a great moderately price system.    Like all similar lines, try it. Commit to it for about six-months. If you or your child does not see a noticeable difference, experiment with a different system or consult your physician.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the [[ASIN:B00ON1VGZA Benzac cleanser]] and the hydrator together, after doing a skin test on my arm.  (I&#x27;ve been burned before--literally--and test everything on my arm before using it on my face.)  No burns, but there&#x27;s also no improvement in my skin.  This is normal for me, though.  I haven&#x27;t found anything that helps yet.  I break out regularly, probably due to stress, but not so badly that I want to take a prescription to try to control it.  I had hoped that a little salicylic acid might make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it does make a difference.  It dries out my face, especially my nose and forehead.  Since my face is usually an oil slick this is a little surprising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the cleanser and hydrator in the mornings, and a couple of days later tried adding both to my night routine as well.  (The drying was only starting then, so I didn&#x27;t realize it would get worse.)  The smell of the hydrator was strong enough that it woke me up several times through the night.  It has no added fragrance, so one or more of the ingredients is the culprit.  I haven&#x27;t used these at night since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to try these, and see if another moisturizer at night will help, or if my skin will adjust.  I keep hoping that someday I can face the world without a stress zit on the tip of my nose, and I&#x27;ll live with some drying if this will solve the problem over time.  But so far, I&#x27;m not hopeful.</li>
    <li> A decent cleanser that seems to do it&#x27;s job. I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference from this compared to other face washes on the market, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s just nothing special.</li>
    <li> This Benzac Blemish Clearing Hydrator is a very good moisturizer and does seem to work at controlling minor acne outbreaks, but does not do much to help with a larger outbreak. I have cystic acne and both of my adult children also get the occasional outbreak, but my daughter decided that she would keep using this after my son and I decided it wouldn&#x27;t really help us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is actually very pleasant, at least to me and it does leave the skin feeling very soft. The amount of actual acne fighting medication is fairly low in this, so it is better suited to someone with minor acne flareups,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended, with the caveats above!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
    <li> This product did as well as the clean &#x27;n&#x27; clear that I had been using. It didn&#x27;t seem to irritate my sensitive skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is a little thick, so you have to use it sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the smell. It has a strong odor. Maybe the essential oil that it contains, but it doesn&#x27;t smell pleasant to me.&lt;br /&gt;For that reason, I very likely won&#x27;t be getting any more of it.&lt;br /&gt;The clean &#x27;n&#x27; clear I used was a fraction of the price and didn&#x27;t smell horrible.</li>
    <li> After 2+ days of application to a selected spot, this seemed to decrease redness &amp; swelling at the point of the blemish.  I didn&#x27;t experience any drying, but I haven&#x27;t used this as a daily regimen for long.  The bottle is TINY, and I doubt it would last long as a &amp;#34;whole face&amp;#34; application as suggested.  For the occasional blemish, it works fine.</li>
    <li> This is a good, light moisturizer with a mild dose of salicylic acid in the mix. Unlike many similar products, it does not irritate my skin or eyes, or leave a sticky layer on the skin. Among products of this type, this is the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This contains enough sallicylic acid to be effective, and attack acne. I sometime breakout overnight, and I didn&#x27;t have that problem when I applied this before bed! I really couldn&#x27;t ask for better results, except one caveat: this product promises to not be drying. That&#x27;s a hard claim to make with sallicylic acid products, and this one was no different. I have dry, acne prone skin. When I used this alone, it caused dry patches (although not severe ones) on my face. When I used it with a toner and moisturizer, it made those products a bit less effective but it saved me from the dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily skin, this should be an ideal product for you. If you&#x27;re like me with dry skin in a dry climate, make sure you have a non-clogging moisturizer to use in conjunction.</li>
    <li> This review is for the Benzac Blemish and Clearing Hydrator. I&#x27;m not sure why the revew link takes me to the Benzac Complete Acne Solution Regimen Kit, because I didn&#x27;t get the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I really like the Blemish Clearing Hydrator. I tried Clearasil and that dried out my skin horribly. This seems to be much more gentle on my sensitive skin though I did still get some dryness. I&#x27;m not sure about these products. Having skin that is too dry can cause acne just as easily as having skin that is to oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active and inactive ingredients list is in the item description, so I&#x27;m not going to post it in my review. The scent isn&#x27;t too overpowering and it isn&#x27;t bad. It does smell a bit medicinal though. It&#x27;s nice to clean your face with as long as you don&#x27;t overuse it. I&#x27;ve been breaking out on the side of my neck lately and this does seem to be helping with that.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m being too harsh on this product giving it only 3 stars, as it&#x27;s the only one I have tried in the Benzac line.  As a hydrator it works well. As an acne control or acne clearing product it is &amp;#34;meh.&amp;#34;  (you know, average - 3 stars).  I have had acne my whole life - never bad enough to go to a dermatologist but there&#x27;s always a breakout coming at some point.  And now at age 50, you&#x27;d think this would be gone, but nope.  I still get a zit or two on my face every now and then.  I was hoping this product with salicylic acid and the addition of sandalwood would help.  I&#x27;ve been using this hydrator for over 2 weeks now.  As a test, I have been applying it to only the left side of my face.  The scent of this does seem &amp;#34;citrus&amp;#34; to me, it&#x27;s an odd scent that I can&#x27;t describe - not really bad, but not pleasant, either.  Still, it&#x27;s faint and goes away rather quickly after applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the effectiveness of the product itself, while the acne is no less or no more on the left side of my face where I am using the Benzac Blemish Clearing Hydrator, I can see a visible difference in the smoothness of lines on my face.  Interesting, since I&#x27;m using this in combination with Dermalogica products - so my full face is getting hydrated from that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After hydrating with this the left side of my face does feel smoother and cleaner.  not sure why, the Dermalogica products aren&#x27;t bad, but I&#x27;m glad I only have a trial size of those - and I won&#x27;t be purchasing the full size of those.  I realize that companies create their products to work together, so using and reviewing just this one (step 3) product out of their 3-step system may be unfair.  With how the hydrator alone has been nice to my skin, though not given me any sort of &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; for the acne control, I may see about getting a trial pack of the Benzac in order to get a full review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish I could finally find a skin care line that works with my skin. It&#x27;s been a continual search my whole life and nothing yet has blown me away as the perfect solution for my acne-prone skin.  I&#x27;ll update this review if I find that using the full Benzac line is beneficial.continual search my whole life and nothing yet has blown me away as the perfect solution for my acne-prone skin.  I&#x27;ll update this review if I find that using the full Benzac line is beneficial.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this and has been getting good results.  She has had problems with two so-called gentle products from Neutrogena, but this has not caused any irritation. Her only complaint is the stuff stinks - don&#x27;t expect floral or spring mornings when using it!</li>
    <li> Even though I’m in my forties, I still get the occasional acne breakout. Benzac goes on smooth with a light scent.I had a pimple on my chin and it started clearing up within a few days.  I also have large pores on either side of my nose which are prone to blackheads. The Benzac helped that area too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fourteen year old son, who almost always has a pimple or two, used this and in just under a week there was a noticeable difference in his acne. It wasn&#x27;t all gone but reduced. I would recommend starting off with once a day, like the instructions say. Both myself and my son noticed some dryness in the areas where we used this.</li>
