      <li>i love this cream is so good</li>
      <li>To be honest with you better off mixing about 4 scoops of grounded coffee and 1TB of olive oil and throwing in the microwave for 40 seconds.</li>
      <li>WHY ITS BETTER TO</li>
      <li>Love it...</li>
      <li>thats ok because ive been using it for 4 days</li>

      <li>i love the cool&lt;br</li>
      <li>but u have to workout for it to work even better</li>
      <li>so I feel more comfortable in skirts and swimsuits.  </li>
      <li>am buying more right now!</li>
      <li>This stuff is GREAT at quenching your thighs to make them super duper soft!</li>
      <li>it makes it smooth to the touch</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price either, totally worth it!</li>
      <li>As of right now, I can&#x27;t judge how well it works because I just started, So I gave it 3 stars!</li>
      <li>cool sensation it feels like it works</li>
      <li>I love it and will DEFINITELY buy more.</li>
      <li>In my opinion the eveline products are the best I have used to reduce cellulite, I alternate between this and the 3-D (in the red bottle), and I use the shower scrub about 3 times a week.  </li>
      <li>but I felt like I saw a bit of results after the very first application</li>
      <li>It is an okay lotion, but it isn&#x27;t as effective for firming as some of the other Eveline products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>Currently, I find that the Slim Extreme 3d Super-concentrated Serum Shaping Buttocks works best...</li>
      <li>Smells pretty, though.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s actually making it bloat more.</li>
      <li>it helps smooth your skin.. and the smell is not harsh. .</li>
      <li>My thighs were ready to be shown off that day!</li>
      <li>As long as you follow the directions, eat a healthy diet, and include a workout regimen, you will see results.</li>
      <li>My skin is firmer and smoother pretty much overnight</li>
      <li>Love the cool feeling it leaves on my skin and even if it&#x27;s not a permanent solution, it helps tighten and diminish cellulite on the surface for a few hours</li>
      <li>and my legs look much smoother already.</li>
      <li>this one really works...fast shipping</li>
      <li>haha</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and still don&#x27;t see a considerable difference nor an improvement!</li>
      <li>However as far it getting rid of cellulite that is a bit of a stretch!  </li>
      <li>But I will update in a few weeks! :]</li>
      <li>It feels like I just rubbed Vicks or Icy Hot on my ass and thighs!</li>
      <li>and I can really see the improvement and results, but you can actually start seeing them in a week.</li>
      <li>It is almost like the smell of icy hot..</li>
      <li>some reviewers said it does smell like icy hot but</li>
      <li>I had some cellulite in my upper thighs that bothered me not horrible but a few areas below my butt were pretty deep, after a few days I noticed some improvement, but after a month a noticed major improvements!</li>
      <li>I didnt notice aNy firming and barely any moisturizing</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Doesnt see any Change</li>
    <li> It may be my imagination but I felt like I saw a bit of results after the very first application, however, I did not experience any cooling sensation. This is my 4 th day using it twice daily and my legs look much smoother already. I have moderate cellulite and this stuff is helping to battle it. I love it and will DEFINITELY buy more.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product a couple days ago. I have only used it twice. So far so good. I would definitely improve the smell though! To me, it seriously smells like Robitussin! I feel like I bathed in cough syrup!! lol The cooling sensation is something to get used to for me! It feels like I just rubbed Vicks or Icy Hot on my ass and thighs! haha I love the shimmer! I obviously can&#x27;t see it on my backside, but I see it on my hands after I&#x27;m done. Coming from a person who is OBSESSED with glitter, the shimmer makes me happy!&lt;br /&gt;  As of right now, I can&#x27;t judge how well it works because I just started, So I gave it 3 stars! But I will update in a few weeks! :]</li>
    <li> I have seen some improvement on belly and thighs!  Nice smell too!</li>
    <li> I have tried every cream or lotion under the sun. This stuff ACTUALLY does what it says it does. My skin is firmer and smoother pretty much overnight and I am actually thinner when I use it. It helps eliminate summer puffiness from the heat too. Better than It Works. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> absolutely love this...am buying more right now! Love the glimmer, plus the cellulite reduction, works perfect together....and the smell is fine.</li>
    <li> serum arrived within time promised.like some reviewers said it does smell like icy hot but thats ok because ive been using it for 4 days &amp; i do notice results already,i can feel it tighten my skin. it makes it smooth to the touch,i can see the cellulite disappearing.this is one of those products you can actually believe what they tell you.i will continue to buy this..yes i would recommend this serum for anyone needing to get rid of cellulite</li>
    <li> It does what it says.. it helps smooth your skin.. and the smell is not harsh. . It is almost like the smell of icy hot.. but after that smell subsides it leaves a kinda mango coca butter smell. You do still have to exercise.. I used it to with a wrap.</li>
    <li> I like the eveline products because they work for me. I exercise while I use them. I have seen quite a change in my body since using them. If you exercise they will definitely work on the cellulite areas.</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT at quenching your thighs to make them super duper soft! However as far it getting rid of cellulite that is a bit of a stretch!  I have been using it for about a month and a half..Tightens and firms NOT! To be honest with you better off mixing about 4 scoops of grounded coffee and 1TB of olive oil and throwing in the microwave for 40 seconds. Then add a few squirts of this stuff to it and slather it on your thighs warp them and sit for 20 minutes then rinse off. My thighs were ready to be shown off that day! Don&#x27;t waste your money on the promise that it will get rid of your lumpy thighs. However as a moisturizer it&#x27;s TOP NOTCH!</li>
    <li> This product worked very good for me. i would rub some Slim Extreme 3D on before I exrcise, so far I have lost 3 inches off my waist.that is without cganging my eating habits. Ilove the way this product smell. I have tried other products like this and they never worked</li>
    <li> Use frequently I like this and the other product from the same vendor.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Love the product in conjunction with the waist training waist cincher.</li>
    <li> Love it...this one really works...fast shipping</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a tingling effect as mentioned. Smells pretty, though. I hope that the product works for me which I am using for my stomach.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work. I think it&#x27;s actually making it bloat more. I&#x27;m an exercise fanatic and it is worse on the days I use this</li>
    <li> I NEVER RECIEVED IT, DAMN DCAM ARTIST THIS US WHY ITS BETTER TO ONLY BY FROM PRIME!!! I NEVER GIT MY MONEY BACK OR THE PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Love how cold it gets to let u know it works just started using it so I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet but I only use it once a day to start with cause of how cold it gets.</li>
    <li> It work like they say it would.!!!</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. I have been using it for three months and I can really see the improvement and results, but you can actually start seeing them in a week. Love it! I can wear shorts again.</li>
    <li> i love this item it works retty gud but u have to workout for it to work even better i love the cool&lt;br /&gt;feelin too it&#x27;s like u can feel it workin , but wear a tummy trimmer while ur workin out it tha is ur trouble area&lt;br /&gt;of the body n they even got them for the thighs an legs as well so come on an try it</li>
    <li> Its my third pursues of this brand! Excellent item!</li>
    <li> As long as you follow the directions, eat a healthy diet, and include a workout regimen, you will see results. Took about 4-6 weeks and still seeing results.</li>
    <li> cool sensation it feels like it works but i haven&#x27;t seen any results</li>
    <li> Good good  very good .after use feel like  cooling</li>
    <li> i love this cream is so good</li>
    <li> I didnt notice aNy firming and barely any moisturizing it smells bad...the only reason I gave it two stars was because of the gold glitter.</li>
    <li> I tried this one on a whim...or maybe I wanted to be glittery that day (it has a little gold glitter in it). It is an okay lotion, but it isn&#x27;t as effective for firming as some of the other Eveline products I&#x27;ve tried. Admittedly, I am looking for a lot since I&#x27;m dealing with post-weight loss skin sagging. Currently, I find that the Slim Extreme 3d Super-concentrated Serum Shaping Buttocks works best...and yes, I use it on my upper arms, thighs, butt, and belly...basically everywhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month and still don&#x27;t see a considerable difference nor an improvement! I&#x27;ll give it another month and let you know ...</li>
    <li> Love the cool feeling it leaves on my skin and even if it&#x27;s not a permanent solution, it helps tighten and diminish cellulite on the surface for a few hours so I feel more comfortable in skirts and swimsuits.  The glow it leaves is really nice also!</li>
    <li> In my opinion the eveline products are the best I have used to reduce cellulite, I alternate between this and the 3-D (in the red bottle), and I use the shower scrub about 3 times a week.  I had some cellulite in my upper thighs that bothered me not horrible but a few areas below my butt were pretty deep, after a few days I noticed some improvement, but after a month a noticed major improvements! I truly believe my cellulite has been reduced by 75-80%. You can&#x27;t beat the price either, totally worth it!</li>
    <li> good product helps in slimming the&lt;br /&gt;area targeted</li>
