      <li>How I love this fragrance!!!</li>
      <li>GREAT PRICE</li>
      <li>Always perfect - my favorite fragrance.............</li>
      <li>Used this years ago delighted to find it still avsilabl</li>
      <li>But if you love it anyway, this is a beautiful bottle.  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love this perfume!</li>
      <li>I will continue shopping here for my favorite fragrances!</li>
      <li>I love the sophisticated look and will be happy to buy the refill when I need it.  </li>
      <li>Make someone happy buy this lovely scent for someone special.  </li>
      <li>This is actually a better buy for that reason.  </li>
      <li>Smells great without covering the whole room.  </li>
      <li>For My wife on Valentines Day, it&#x27;s Her favorite.</li>
      <li>The point is, this ISN&#x27;T the famous bottle with the pair-of-doves cap; it&#x27;s the copper/gold spray canister.</li>
      <li>It is both lovely and practical.</li>
      <li>My wife&#x27;s love this, she has been wearing it for over 30 years.</li>
      <li>nothing more  to say.  </li>
      <li>My favorite for many years.</li>
      <li>They will love it and so will you.</li>
      <li>Beautiful - my favorite scent in such quality packaging!</li>
      <li>but you get a bottle with a huge dove.  </li>
      <li>I recieved the product on time and wrapped securely.</li>
      <li>Lovely, fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>So I regularly look out for great deals on Amazon and this option turned up.</li>
      <li>I just love this fragrance and this was such a good price.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the original fragrance.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this is the original L&#x27;Air Du Temps fragrance.  </li>
      <li>~smile!~</li>
      <li>It has been my favorite perfime for over 25 years, and this is the first time I recieved this bottle type.</li>
      <li>Give yourself something special today...</li>
      <li>My mom loved the present</li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s been in existence for many years, I believe it is still a modern scent.</li>
      <li>This parfum is the cleanest ,softest.. most gentle parfum on planet earth...  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s going to smell the same whether you buy the bottle with the sculpted birds on top, or not.  </li>
      <li>So if you&#x27;re a first time buyer and you want the doves, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
      <li>This is a long time favorite of my wife.  </li>
      <li>I love the fragrance and have used it for a long time.</li>
      <li>Similar, but very light and not lasting.  </li>
      <li>Very classy looking.</li>
      <li>Everyone who&#x27;s used and loved L&#x27;air du Temps for the past 40 years will recognize that the edt (eau de toilette) is not particularly long lasting anymore.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s core fragrance and while she dabbles in others, old or new, this will always be her number one.</li>
      <li>I wanted the canister shown on the photo, which is convenient for traveling,  and received the one with the pair-of-doves top, which is hard to pack unless kept in the box (too bulky).</li>
      <li>Purchased this as an unexpected gift.  </li>
      <li>The eau de parfum concentration (found elsewhere) is just barely any stronger than the edt.  </li>
      <li>As expected, this product met our expectation at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>It is very flowery, but also has some other undertones.</li>

<li> And it is not exactly the same fragrance as it once was.  </li>
<li> The round style container is why I ordered it and did not get the same container.  </li>
<li> As regards longevity, it does not stay on too long, but definitely a few hours.</li>
<li> Spray is a waste.  </li>

    <li> For My wife on Valentines Day, it&#x27;s Her favorite.</li>
    <li> Always perfect - my favorite fragrance.............</li>
    <li> Beautiful - my favorite scent in such quality packaging! I love the sophisticated look and will be happy to buy the refill when I need it.  It is both lovely and practical.</li>
    <li> My favorite for many years. Delicate and fresh.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;L&#x27;Air Du Temps\\&quot; needs no introduction. It&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s core fragrance and while she dabbles in others, old or new, this will always be her number one. So I regularly look out for great deals on Amazon and this option turned up. The point is, this ISN&#x27;T the famous bottle with the pair-of-doves cap; it&#x27;s the copper/gold spray canister. So if you&#x27;re a first time buyer and you want the doves, don&#x27;t buy this. If you are already overflowing with doves, then this will add a different dimension to your senses.</li>
    <li> I recieved the product on time and wrapped securely. It has been my favorite perfime for over 25 years, and this is the first time I recieved this bottle type. Very classy looking.</li>
    <li> OH! How I love this fragrance!!! Have been using it for ever and ever...(Can&#x27;t count the years.)  GREAT PRICE TOO!!!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! It is very flowery, but also has some other undertones. Although it&#x27;s been in existence for many years, I believe it is still a modern scent. As regards longevity, it does not stay on too long, but definitely a few hours. That&#x27;s why I gave it four and not five stars. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance and have used it for a long time. However, the product I received was not the one I ordered. I wanted the canister shown on the photo, which is convenient for traveling,  and received the one with the pair-of-doves top, which is hard to pack unless kept in the box (too bulky). I&#x27;m assuming amazon didn&#x27;t have what I ordered and sent what they had in the same amount. I would prefer to be informed of the change beforehand.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife because of the container.  It is not what you get!  This type container would have been useable in a travel kit etc but you get a bottle with a huge dove.  The round style container is why I ordered it and did not get the same container.  I could have made my purchase at any drug store and got the &amp;#34;Dove&amp;#34;.  P. U.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t forget  the smell  for this  perfume</li>
    <li> This parfum is the cleanest ,softest.. most gentle parfum on planet earth...  There isn&#x27;t a day goes by that someone doesn&#x27;t  compliment me on the fragrance... ladies... Sometimes a man will make an excuse to get close to me just for a scent. ~smile!~ If your looking for the perfect gift ...this is it ! Give yourself something special today...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the original L&#x27;Air Du Temps fragrance.  Similar, but very light and not lasting.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the original fragrance.</li>
    <li> Only fragrance I wear.........nothing more  to say.  Perfume splash is preferable to spray.  Spray is a waste.  But the business of America is business..............huh!</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s love this, she has been wearing it for over 30 years.</li>
    <li> As expected, this product met our expectation at a reasonable price.</li>

This is actually a better buy for that reason.  But yeah, neither one lasts long at all anymore.</li>
    <li> have used before prefer Norell which is basically unavailable</li>
    <li> I just love this fragrance and this was such a good price. I will continue shopping here for my favorite fragrances!</li>
    <li> Lovely, fresh scent.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Used this years ago delighted to find it still avsilabl</li>
