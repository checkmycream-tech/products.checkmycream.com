      <li>We have gotten good checkups at the dentists.  </li>
      <li>It seems they always discontinue the good products that I like.</li>

      <li>My favorite toothpaste!</li>
      <li>A couple of years ago I added a Sonicare toothbrush to my arsenal and since then my teeth have gotten 2 more shades whiter!  </li>
      <li>Buy it you will love it!</li>
      <li>My teeth love it!</li>
      <li>I always liked the way it was packaged (in a pump, rather than a tube) and liked the flavor of the product.</li>
      <li>Thrilled to know I can still buy it.</li>
      <li>People who have crowns and partials can&#x27;t use the whitening kind since their permanent replacements won&#x27;t whiten.  </li>
      <li>I love this style of toothpaste with the push-pump feature that&#x27;s always handy to use by my sink.</li>
      <li>and I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for such a great price!</li>
      <li>This is a great price and the service was very fast.</li>
      <li>This hard-to-find product in the stores arrived quickly and in good condition.  </li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>But it feels as though all the people that love this toothpaste are being stonewalled as to the WHY&#x27;s &amp; HOW&#x27;s...    </li>
      <li>Nowdays, smaller is better, but not in the case of this awesome toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>I love my Mentadent and don&#x27;t know why stores don&#x27;t give it shelf space anymore</li>
      <li>Toothpaste poured out of the top of the package.  </li>
      <li>Service from this supplier is top notch</li>
      <li>It is a shame this product has disappeared from most store shelves.</li>
      <li>So, just like everyone else, I searched the stores in hopes of finding my precious.</li>
      <li>Stores make more money by selling tubes.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste is fabulous!  </li>
      <li>After months of seeking our favorite toothpaste (which seemingly disappeared off all store shelves) we found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>My family have used Mentadent toothpaste for many years and have been well pleased with the performance of it.  </li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I could not be more pleased with Mentadent</li>
      <li>Great product at a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>I love this product because it stands up on my sink</li>
      <li>I am pleased.</li>
      <li>I was glad to see this product on your web site.  </li>
      <li>This toothpaste tastes great and really leaves your teeth feeling CLEAN!</li>
      <li>Success!!</li>
      <li>I was happy to find this item to delay my move to the new Mentadent product.</li>
      <li>An excellent producy that is getting harder to find.  </li>
      <li>And then to add insult to injury, most stores still stock the Mentadent- Advanced Whitening.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to be able to find my toothpaste and be able to order it at such a great price.  </li>
      <li>It would look kind of funny.  </li>
      <li>And then one day the stores stopped stocking the Advanced Cleaning version of this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Thank you for such great service.</li>
      <li>Until one day I ran into Mentadent - Advanced Cleaning.</li>
      <li>I love the fresh and clean taste that Mentadent leaves on my teeth and mouth.</li>
      <li>Mentadent is also probably one of the pricest toothpastes on the market, but to me it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
      <li>It helps keep my teeth clean too.</li>
      <li>Crest, Colgate, Aquafresh cannot get your teeth as clean as Mentadent.  </li>
      <li>The cost to produce the Mentadent case and the cartridge is pricey, as well as the fact it takes up more shelf space than the regular tubes of toothpaste, I&#x27;m sure this has something to do with why the stores are not carrying the product.  </li>
      <li>Thank you Amazon.com for both continuing to sell it ... at an even better price, and for actually selling a better version than I&#x27;m used to getting.</li>
      <li>How nice it is to be able to just flip the lid, squeeze with one hand, and flip down.</li>
      <li>shame you can&#x27;t find this great product at local stores anymore, but you get fast shipping at reasonable price and where else will you get it?</li>
      <li>It is well worth the shelf space that it occupies.</li>
      <li>MY local stores have quit carrying Mentadent Toothpaste (except for the whitening kind|, so I searched for it online.  </li>
      <li>This WILL NOT work for me as after 2 wks of use the advanced whitening makes my teeth very sensitive!</li>
      <li>I rarely have sores and when I do they go away much faster.</li>
      <li>I immediately signed up for automatic shipments of 6 refills at a time, as I am no longer able to find it in my local stores.    </li>
      <li>I purchased Mentadent Fluoride toothpaste through Amazon.com and am completely satisfied with the product and especially the price.  </li>
      <li>Most of the stores I shop have started only carrying the whitening refills.  </li>
      <li>I order many different things from them.  </li>
      <li>{ will come back here when I need more</li>
      <li>I have been using this product since it first came out.  </li>
      <li>First of all the dispenser is so convenient - it just works.</li>
      <li>Second, the toothpaste leaves your mouth fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>I do not particuarly care for the other Mentadents; once you use the Advanced Cleaning for a while, nothing else compares in the way it leaves your mouth feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering a large stockpile in case it really is going to disappear.</li>
      <li>The price and delivery were very competitive.  </li>
      <li>(    They tried to be helpful and suggested that I replace this S&amp;S item with an \\&quot;advanced whitening\\&quot; item of a similar price.</li>
      <li>We really like this toothpaste both for the quality of it and the pump container.</li>
      <li>One refill last a long time; seems expensive until you&#x27;ve tried it and experience the convenience, great taste, very clean feeling teeth, and easy replacement refills.</li>
      <li>Has unmatched ease of use, and a unique ... epoxy-like squeeze combination of two different types of paste.</li>
      <li>No other toothpaste makes my mouth feel as fresh as Mentadent.  </li>
      <li>As many other users have noted, when I am using Mentadent as part of my oral hygiene program, I have gone for years without any cavities!  </li>
      <li>We love this type of tooth paste; eliminates the tube squeezing; and is perfect for a person who may have arthritis or other disability and has problems holding small objects such as a tube and trying to squeeze with one hand and hold a brush in the other, as my husband who has MS.  </li>
      <li>Heck, I even remember for a short while, they would make these super cute little \\&quot;travel sized Mentadents\\&quot;</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this product for years and prefer it to other tooth pastes.  I am disappointed that Mendtadent is changing their product.  I was happy to find this item to delay my move to the new Mentadent product.</li>
    <li> shame you can&#x27;t find this great product at local stores anymore, but you get fast shipping at reasonable price and where else will you get it?</li>
    <li> I have used Mentadent ever since it came on the market. I always liked the way it was packaged (in a pump, rather than a tube) and liked the flavor of the product. I always thought that it was doing a great job cleaning and protecting my teeth and eliminating tartar, and my feelings were validated when my dentist asked me \\&quot;How come you dont have any tartar this time??\\&quot; (I had been using Mentadent for approx. 8 months at that point)  I told him what I was using and he just sort of nodded and said \\&quot;well, something is working!\\&quot; At my next checkup it was the same story---little to no tartar! He could not believe it and remarked that it was also whitening my teeth---1 shade whiter in about a year of use! (Mentadent contains peroxide)  A couple of years ago I added a Sonicare toothbrush to my arsenal and since then my teeth have gotten 2 more shades whiter!  I could not be more pleased with Mentadent and I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for such a great price! I immediately signed up for automatic shipments of 6 refills at a time, as I am no longer able to find it in my local stores.    UPDATE - MAY 2011: I am SO bummed--and actually a little angry--that Amazon has suddenly decided to drop the Subscribe &amp; Save option on this Mentadent item. &gt;:o(    They tried to be helpful and suggested that I replace this S&amp;S item with an \\&quot;advanced whitening\\&quot; item of a similar price. This WILL NOT work for me as after 2 wks of use the advanced whitening makes my teeth very sensitive! Seriously, if they want to be helpful and show that they appreciate all the years that I have been a loyal customer of this and MANY other items from them they should reinstate the S&amp;S option for this item. &gt;:o(    What&#x27;s next? Suddenly they won&#x27;t even offer this formula of Mentadent at all? :o(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used and loved Mentadent since it 1st came out on the market. I&#x27;ve spent Waaaaay too much time researching why I can&#x27;t find it at ANY store! Can someone please enlighten me as to why I can find NO ANSWERS. We are talking toothpaste, people! I shouldn&#x27;t be this upset. But it feels as though all the people that love this toothpaste are being stonewalled as to the WHY&#x27;s &amp; HOW&#x27;s...    I&#x27;ve spent alot of time trying to find answers and have come up with 0. If anyone knows, could they please answer this? I promise that you would be helping so many frustrated people besides myself:(    The really weird thing is that when I search on Google for \\&quot;discontinued?\\&quot; etc, I go to where it alludes to an answer...and the site is either selling the product OR there is an \\&quot;oops\\&quot; where the ? &amp; answer has vanished! Was Mentadent snuffed out by the Dental Mob?</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. I have spent a life time suffering from mouth sores on my cheeks and gums. Ever since I have been using Mentadent (over 10 years) I rarely have sores and when I do they go away much faster. It helps keep my teeth clean too. I am over 40 and I have only had 1 cavity in my life. It is a shame this product has disappeared from most store shelves. Buy it you will love it!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is fabulous!  Crest, Colgate, Aquafresh cannot get your teeth as clean as Mentadent.  No comparison at all. I&#x27;ve tried them all since Mentadent started dissapearing from store shelves at Target, Wal-Mart, etc.  The cost to produce the Mentadent case and the cartridge is pricey, as well as the fact it takes up more shelf space than the regular tubes of toothpaste, I&#x27;m sure this has something to do with why the stores are not carrying the product.  Nowdays, smaller is better, but not in the case of this awesome toothpaste.  This toothpaste tastes great and really leaves your teeth feeling CLEAN! I get my order from Amazon.com every 3 months so now I don&#x27;t even have to go to the store to get this great toothpaste.  Thank you Amazon for continuing to carry Mentadent!  My teeth love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mentadent for years, it is the best toothpaste I ever used, and this was a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve also used Mentadent for years (since it came out).  I also have been having trouble finding the product in my local stores.  I emailed the manufacturer and they gave me a couple of stores to go to (Target - out of stock; and Raley&#x27;s).  My local Safeway store also has an empty place on their shelves where Mentadent should be.  I asked the manufacturer if the product was being discountinued - they didn&#x27;t answer that question.   Mentadent does a good job of cleaning teeth &amp; breath.  Although I like the unique dispensing system, it does create a lot of landfill waste.  Mentadent is also probably one of the pricest toothpastes on the market, but to me it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
    <li> We can no longer get this toothpaste locally.  This is a great price and the service was very fast.</li>
    <li> I purchased Mentadent Fluoride toothpaste through Amazon.com and am completely satisfied with the product and especially the price.  For the price of one box at a retail store I received three boxes of 2 refills each.</li>
    <li> Love this toothpaste!  No messy tubes. Great price and it is delivered to my door</li>
    <li> I was so excited to be able to find my toothpaste and be able to order it at such a great price.  Most of the stores I shop have started only carrying the whitening refills.  I cannot use that.  It is too abrasive for me.  Mentadent is a great product and AMAZON is agreat link.  I order many different things from them.  Thank you for such great service.</li>
    <li> It IS getting hard to find.  It looks like it can only be ordered online.  I hope it&#x27;s not the beginning of the end.  No other toothpaste makes my mouth feel as fresh as Mentadent.  I will be ordering a large stockpile in case it really is going to disappear.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years and it was suddenly unavailable at our locaL store. Was ordered and received promply. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I have used the Mentadent product for years and was quite disappointed when it became hard to find in the local stores.Started buying the product through Amazon over a year ago. Service from this supplier is top notch and of course the product is excellent.</li>
    <li> We love this type of tooth paste; eliminates the tube squeezing; and is perfect for a person who may have arthritis or other disability and has problems holding small objects such as a tube and trying to squeeze with one hand and hold a brush in the other, as my husband who has MS.  We can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore and were so happy to find this product on Amazon.  One refill last a long time; seems expensive until you&#x27;ve tried it and experience the convenience, great taste, very clean feeling teeth, and easy replacement refills.</li>
    <li> Thankful for online availibility since this is so difficult to purchase in stores. I have used this product for over 10 yrs. Product was shipped and delivered in 4-5 days</li>
    <li> My family have used Mentadent toothpaste for many years and have been well pleased with the performance of it.  We have gotten good checkups at the dentists.  Recently, I have had trouble finding the product in stock at the local stores.  I was very pleased to find it on Amazon at a reduced price from what I had been paying.</li>
    <li> This hard-to-find product in the stores arrived quickly and in good condition.  I am pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the longest time.  I started buying it online since I moved to TX 3 years ago.  For some reason, no stores carry this product.  Now I moved to DC area and still the same situation.  No one has it!!!!  I think this is the best toothpaste ever on the market and all the stores should carry it!!!!  Price on amazon is fair and I am very happy that they carry this product.</li>
    <li> After months of seeking our favorite toothpaste (which seemingly disappeared off all store shelves) we found it on Amazon. Fair price so we stocked up.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s becoming very difficult to purchase Mentadent in my supermarket. I must say it&#x27;s a snap with Amazon.    Just schedule the purchase and it arrives at you door. This is a great feature.    I would also like the chance to purchase the plastic sleeves the toothpaste slides into. With all these refills you think they would provide some of the sleeves as well.</li>
    <li> Thank you Sam&#x27;s Club for introducing me to Mentadent. Thank you Amazon.com for both continuing to sell it ... at an even better price, and for actually selling a better version than I&#x27;m used to getting. How nice it is to be able to just flip the lid, squeeze with one hand, and flip down. Has unmatched ease of use, and a unique ... epoxy-like squeeze combination of two different types of paste. Tastes good, and cleans well. Add it to the Sonic care toothbrush, and it is perfect. None of the tube hassles. So what is it that made stores stop selling it? The answer to all questions of money ... it lasts too long, and you get too much for your price. Stores make more money by selling tubes. Ease of use plus ease of buying ... order online, and it arrives at your door. They do need to also sell the plastic sleeves the toothpaste slides into. With all these refills you think they would provide some of the sleeves as well.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it stands up on my sink and I can open it with one hand and spread on my toothbrush. No need to open messy cap and replace and find space on shelf as you do with regular toothpaste.  I can no longer find it in the stores.  It seems they always discontinue the good products that I like.</li>
    <li> Sorry it was discontinued...love the pump!</li>
    <li> I have been using Mentadent since shortly after it first came out.  Heck, I even remember for a short while, they would make these super cute little \\&quot;travel sized Mentadents\\&quot; and of course - those are long gone and rare as all get out.  I have noticed my local Wally World and big box pharmacies stopped carrying Mentadent and I tried several other brands (Crest, Colgate, etc) as a result - but was missing my Mentadent freshness and so I was THRILLED and happy to find it online!  As many other users have noted, when I am using Mentadent as part of my oral hygiene program, I have gone for years without any cavities!  I love my Mentadent and don&#x27;t know why stores don&#x27;t give it shelf space anymore but as long as I can order it online - it&#x27;s one less thing to go out and hunt for at local merchants (their loss!).</li>
    <li> I too was happy to find this product at Amazon.com.  No stores in my town carry this product.  People who have crowns and partials can&#x27;t use the whitening kind since their permanent replacements won&#x27;t whiten.  It would look kind of funny.  I have been using Mentadent for years and feel that this toothpaste helps me fight the gum disease that has a negative effect on my teeth.</li>
    <li> Excellent product--have used it for years, but no longer can find it in stores. Amazon seems to be the only place left where it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> OK, The Bad New: Way over-packaged, and that&#x27;s not good for the environment.    The good news: I began using Mentadent 10 or 12 years ago, and maybe it&#x27;s just coincidence, but since that time I think I&#x27;ve had one cavity. Like someone else wrote, people have also commented on how white my teeth are.    There are very few products that I feel any sort of brand allegiance to, but Mentadent is one of them. (And it concerns me that people are finding it harder and harder to find. I wonder if this is the beginning of the end?\\&quot;</li>
    <li> An excellent producy that is getting harder to find.  The price and delivery were very competitive.  { will come back here when I need more</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpaste! I love this style of toothpaste with the push-pump feature that&#x27;s always handy to use by my sink. I buy this in bulk online because it&#x27;s not available in local drug stores. One caution, though, if the toothpaste has been stored too long in a warehouse, you might have to prompt one of the two tubes to start the flow of toothpaste.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have always been big on fresh breath. And for that reason, I have tried every toothpaste known to man, including but not limited to (several variations of): Aqua Fresh, Crest, Colgate, AIM, etc., etc., etc. Until one day I ran into Mentadent - Advanced Cleaning. I&#x27;m telling you, after brushing with this, nothing else could compare. And when my wife brushed with hit for the first time, all other remaining toothpaste went straight into the trash. No joke. And then one day the stores stopped stocking the Advanced Cleaning version of this toothpaste. WHAT THE HELL!! I mean, what idiot made that genius move. And then to add insult to injury, most stores still stock the Mentadent- Advanced Whitening. That crap is wack! So, just like everyone else, I searched the stores in hopes of finding my precious. But no luck. Back to the old drawing board, \\&quot;Aqua Fresh, Crest, Colgate, AIM, etc., etc., etc.\\&quot; Until one day I thought to myself... on-line purchase. Success!! My precious is home again!</li>
    <li> MY local stores have quit carrying Mentadent Toothpaste (except for the whitening kind|, so I searched for it online.  It is my favorite, and I was happy to have found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. First of all the dispenser is so convenient - it just works. Second, the toothpaste leaves your mouth fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Just purchased a new refill and found they have been repackaged.    The plastic is very flimsy and after the second use it failed.  Toothpaste poured out of the top of the package.  IMO the product is now useless.</li>
    <li> Great product at a reasonable price.  Used to buy at Sam&#x27;s and they stopped stocking.  Then bought at Walmart and they stopped stocking.  This is the only toothpaste I have found makes no mess and virtually all of the product gets used.  I&#x27;ve got it on my automatic shipping schedule.</li>
    <li> I was glad to see this product on your web site.  I&#x27;ve used Mentadent for years and cannot find it any longer in any retail store.  Guess it&#x27;s been discontinued.  Your site said limited quantities which is why I bought 3 pkgs.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh and clean taste that Mentadent leaves on my teeth and mouth. Hard to belive that it ius hard to find such a great product in pharmacies and grocety stores. It is well worth the shelf space that it occupies.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since it first came out.  I was having big time peridontal problems at the time which my dentist couldn&#x27;t solve with mouthwashes.  Once I started using Mentadent my problems cleared up and I never looked back.  I think the peroxide in Mentadent is probably what did the trick.  We recycle plastic so that is not an issue.  I panicked when I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore and bought a supply on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpaste, delivered on-time and at an excellent price -- what is not to like?</li>
    <li> While routine shopping, it was discovered several stores no longer carried this product. I began a mission, experiencing periodic withdrawal and panic while hopping from Target to WalMart to pharmacy to pharmacy. Finally one night, I Googled, and, lookie here! A stockpile was immediately ordered, and now I just fear that Amazon will discontinue carrying it without warning.    I do not particuarly care for the other Mentadents; once you use the Advanced Cleaning for a while, nothing else compares in the way it leaves your mouth feeling clean and refreshed. The others leave an unpleasant aftertaste and we just don&#x27;t have that super-clean feeling. The Crystal Ice is a little on the stronger side as far as taste goes, but it&#x27;s worth every single brush stroke! This discovery was like reconnecting with an old friend!!</li>
    <li> What a deal!!!  This is soooo hard to find and I have been using it for a long time. Thrilled to know I can still buy it.</li>
    <li> I buy Mentadent here since it went off the market in stores.  It is the most convenient dispenser for your bathroom sink ever,  and the product is excellent.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with Mentadent. I live in an area where refills are non-existent. But Amazon.com has the refills. Wonderful service!</li>
    <li> excellent while it lasted</li>
    <li> After using it, my teeth are getting sensitive. I will not use it again. I am using cogate after that.</li>
    <li> We really like this toothpaste both for the quality of it and the pump container.</li>
