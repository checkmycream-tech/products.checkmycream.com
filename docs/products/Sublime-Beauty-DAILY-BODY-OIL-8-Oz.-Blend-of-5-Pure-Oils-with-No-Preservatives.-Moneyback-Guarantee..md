<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have tried many high end oils,creams and body butters but, this oil is absolutely AMAZING. I guess it must be because of the combination of oils. It is absorbed fairly quick but, what is most important is how it makes your skin feel and look. I only wish it came in a larger bottle. You will not regret getting this body oil!</li>
    <li> Great Stuff!  I love this oil!  The combination of the different oils in this makes for one wonderful product!  Absorbs quickly and leaves your skins very soft.  Keep the great stuff coming Sublime Beauty!</li>
    <li> This product was not what I expected.  It has an off putting smell.  Actually smells like a lubricated condom.  I had to put a scented oil in it to get rid of that smell. And it does not keep my skin moist all day. Not worth the money I spent on it.</li>
    <li> very good.&lt;br /&gt;my body is moisture.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been using it for about 6 weeks now and my skin feels softer and firmer.  I use it as a part of my dry skin brushing routine; also at bedtime I like to rub some into my hands and feet.  This is the first winter that I have not had that painful, peeling skin on my fingers (like right beneath the cuticle, ouch) and one hangnail, so far. That has always been a winter issue for me, but not this year.  The only thing that I would change is the bottle top. I like a spray bottle better so I transferred the product to another bottle for the spray top, which is too bad because the blue bottle is pretty.  I would also like to mention that when my order arrived , some of the oil had leaked out into the box.  I never directly contacted the seller about this; she read it in my delivery review.  She sent me another bottle of the product; I was suprised and thankful.  I will order this product from this seller again</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin and have tried everything to fix it. I ran across a You Tube video on dry brushing and decided to give it a try. Well...my skin has NEVER looked better....my 58 year old skin that is! After dry brushing I shower and while my skin is still damp I use the Sublime Body Oil. It does not lay on top of your skin like a lot of other oils so that was a plus right away. I noticed after a week of doing the dry brushing and the body oil my skin was actually healing itself.  Trust me I&#x27;m a beauty product junkie and have tried EVERYTHING!!! My skin looks really healthy and that&#x27;s saying a lot.</li>
    <li> This oil is pretty light and absorbs easily. I have put it on after a shower and also on dry skin. Both ways it spread well and left my skin soft, without feeling greasy. I would put this a tiny bit below macadamia oil but ahead of avocado and far ahead of olive oil, as far as skin happiness and lack of greasiness. The only thing that throws me a bit is the sesame scent - it&#x27;s not strong, but it does put me in mind of savory food. But like I said, it&#x27;s a very light scent, and it would be very easy to add an essential oil to scent to one&#x27;s own preferences.</li>
    <li> Only negative is it&#x27;s oil and can get messy to dispense, but that&#x27;s not the fault of the product itself.  It absorbs into the skin quick too.  Love this stuff, but wish it was cheaper... :(</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I have tried many different lotions and body butters for my dry, sensitive skin, but never knew about body oil until this product was offered to me at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. I am now absolutely hooked - this product from Sublime has opened me up to the endless benefits of body oil, and my dry skin has since undergone very visible improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to note:&lt;br /&gt;- This oil is incredibly absorbent. I am an impatient person so my biggest concern was the amount of time it would take for the body oil to dry, but I was ecstatic to find that my skin soaked it up very quickly upon application.&lt;br /&gt;- It is very moisturizing and leaves skin looking and feeling well-hydrated. This is a sensation I have not been able to replicate with any other lotions, creams, body butters, and so forth. My skin looks and feels smooth to the touch, and also has a very healthy, pleasant-looking shine to it.&lt;br /&gt;- It is not greasy as you would expect oil to be. I was expecting wet, greasy massage-like oil, but this actually absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t uncomfortably sit on top of my skin as I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;- The container is a bit small considering the amount of oil I use per day. I apply it once in the morning and once at night, and after one week, a little over 1/4 of the bottle is gone, so I am concerned about how long this product will last me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was an eye-opening purchase that opened me up to the possibilities and benefits of body oil versus other expensive creams and lotions.</li>
    <li> Is your skin like mine in the wintertime?? If so you might want to try this product! I took advantage of a promotional offer and am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;It seems like in the winter my legs and feet no matter how much  moisturize are always showing signs of dryness. I hate that look and the feel of the dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am a bit sensitive to certain perfumes, so I often look for unscented products, as well as natural and organics.&lt;br /&gt;This Daily Oil from Sublime fit my needs perfectly! A special blend of 5 natural oils, Sweet Almond Oil * Sesame Oil * Aloe * Jojoba * Argan Oil as well as Vitamin E is perfect and has many natural benefits.&lt;br /&gt;Is this product oily, yes! It is oil, use sparingly, and rub in well. It will be absorbed into your dry skin, and soon you will start feeling and seeing the benefits!&lt;br /&gt;The skin oil has absolutely no scent!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using this after you have a nice long bath or shower. I have not used it on my face or neck, or my hands dues to the oiliness. I have taken a photo of the sheen left on the back of my hand when I sampled this product, before first use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to have hydrated skin come summertime!~ No more scaly dry legs and arms!&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully packaged in a pretty blue clear bottle, and sealed in plastic, then packaged in a sheer royal blue drawstring pouch. Would also be great for gift giving!</li>
    <li> I received this oil as a promotion for review and evaluation and I have been loving it! I love that it&#x27;s all natural and has no additives. I wish I had discovered this while I was pregnant and searching for a safe oil! It is the dead of winter and very dry here now but this oil has been keeping up! I don&#x27;t have a lot of time in the morning but the oil absorbs so quickly I had added it to my routine. My hands are not greasy and my skin has a healthy look after I apply it. I  have even put a trace amount on the ends of my hair before I blow dry. Overall I am very happy with this body oil and I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed either.</li>
    <li> Love this body oil, leaves my skin silky and soft</li>
    <li> The plastic wrap around the bottle (within the pouch) had oil all over on it.&lt;br /&gt;Must have leaked.&lt;br /&gt; It wasn&#x27;t scent-less as advertised (maybe air went in it or something)?&lt;br /&gt;I still wanted to give it a try but oil didn&#x27;t seem to absorb easily into my skin, more like just sitting on the top of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought all five star review was hard to believe. Not sure if all those five star reviewers were being honest.</li>
    <li> I received on time,I was very happy,it had no smell and that&#x27;s a plus.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Love the soft silky feeling on your skin. A little goes a long way and it soaks in with no oily residue. I really like this product and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This body oil works really well, especially after time in the sun and on my dry elbows and heels! I love how well it soaks in to the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I live in an extreme climate where the temperature in the winter is below zero most of the time. Due to this my skin suffers. I have extremely dry skin, nothing really works. I was super happy to get a complimentary bottle of this product and share my honest and unbiased opinion with it here with you. This Body Oil by Sublime Beauty arrives in a beautiful royal blue taffeta bag! It makes it feel so luxurious. I use this product after I dry brush and shower/bathe. I wake up the next morning and my skin feels absolutely amazing! This oil is so nice, it absorbs into your skin so you don&#x27;t have that oily feeling. There is also no scent to this product. A few other things I love about this product is that it is made with 5 essential oils and it comes with a 100% product satisfaction guarantee so you have nothing to worry about! I love this product and I know that you would to!</li>
    <li> I like it.  It leaves my skin feeling smooth.  A little more of a scent would be nice, but for some this is probably a plus.  It arrived quickly and was packaged well.</li>
    <li> This oil is a sweet blessing. The bottle arrived a bit leaky. It was in a bag tho so that was great! Then taking the cap off was really easy because of the little lever on the cap. When I poured some, boy did it pour. I was afraid it was too much. But applying it was sooo good. It spread out so well, I was able to get all of my belly, back, buttocks and hands covered with just one pour of oil. Love it! This wasn&#x27;t greasy or yucky. It was greasy and healthy! Then as it soaked it, it left NO oily residue but a nice soft sheen. I left one hand undone and the other hand shines compared to the undone hand. I&#x27;m happy I was able to get this at a one time promo price to give a completely honest review of this item. I would DEFINITELY recommend this to anyone looking for an all purpose body oil. This is the oil I will always come back to buy!</li>
    <li> Love this light oil, gets absorbed easily and does not leave a sticky feel.&lt;br /&gt;Particularly love this product during the winter months when my skin is very dry from all the heater.</li>
    <li> During the winter in Indiana, my skin gets extremely dry so when I was given the opportunity to purchase this body oil at a special price to test for quality, I was excited to see how it would work.  I generally use Avon&#x27;s Skin So Soft after my shower and found that this product was comparable to that without the perfumy smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle arrives in a drawstring bag which doesn&#x27;t improve the quality of the product, but sure makes it cute for gift giving.  This is actually a combination of five different oils.  It has a slight smell in the bottle but once it&#x27;s on your skin, it is virtually odorless.  Immediately after showering, while my skin is still wet, I put this oil on my entire body focusing on the areas that are prone to chafing.  For me, that is my thighs.  After about five minutes, I gently dab myself with a towel to remove any remaining moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin did not feel greasy after using as the oil was absorbed by my skin.  After only a few uses, I could already tell the difference in how great my skin felt.  I recommend this product for anyone who suffers from dry skin.</li>
    <li> Sublime Beauty Daily Body Oil contains oils that are specifically focused on moisturizing the skin. These oils have been used for people for a long time and compliment each other in this blend to absorb quickly and hydrate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Sweet Almond Oil, Aloe Oil, Sesame Oil, Argan Oil, Jojoba Oil and Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the simple ingredient list. Though I try to avoid any preservatives, Tocopheryl Acetate is usually a preservative found in most natural products. EWG Skin Deep Database ranks Tocopheryl Acetate as a 3 (which is on the low side of Moderate Hazard) because of potential for contamination with Hydroquinone during the manufacturing process. If you have sensitive skin, be aware of this ingredient that can cause irritation, redness and rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The daily body oil comes in a dark blue plastic bottle. Oils should always be stored in dark colored containers to preserve the qualities of the oil and extend the shelf life. Oils that are not stored in dark bottles will oxidize, lose potency and become ineffective. I would like to see Sublime Beauty move toward glass bottles. Oils can sometimes react with plastic bottles. Therefore, dark glass bottles are preferable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage: The bottle contains 8 oz of the oil blend. A little of the oil blend goes a long way, so this bottle will last quite a bit of time. I have been using the body oil after showering, applying on my legs and arms. Those are usually the only places I apply a moisturizer. I found that when oils are applied on slightly damp skin, they absorb quicker. My after-shower process is to towel off and apply a few drops of the daily oil to each body part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little afraid of the oil coming out too fast from the pour top, but quickly realized that if I tip it almost vertical, the oil drizzles out and I can control how much comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil hardly has any smell and if it does, it smells natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: My skin is soft and moisturized, even during the dry winter months. My hands have taken a beating between extremely cold weather and doing dishes by hand. Regular application of this oil has helped to moisturizer my hands and my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Sublime Beauty Daily Body Oil, but would like to see the move away from Tocopheryl Acetate as a preservative and the move toward dark glass bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I receive the product to facilitate this review.

    <li> This lightweight oil leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. Although it is odorless, it smelled just a bit earthy but I didn&#x27;t mind it. I&#x27;m using it all over my body instead of lotion and I love it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t see results yet but I just love body oils</li>
    <li> Great product, Super food for your skin!  No fragrance for those that are sensitive or live with scent sensitive people.  Personally a little dissapointed you cant smell any of the ingredients 5 natural oils which  have divine aromas.&lt;br /&gt; *Received product at discounted price for reviewing upon receiving.*</li>
    <li> Love the way this product makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> Wow!  I ordered the oil to use after brushing my body and taking a nice warm shower.  I live in an area that is very dry, so my skin is also dry.  I could not believe how quickly this oil was absorbed and how good it felt.  I will certainly be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t like using oil because of the greasy feel, but this oil absorbs very fast and leaves no greasy residue.  It has basically no scent, so nothing to worry about for those allergic to scents or who just don&#x27;t like that sort of thing.</li>
    <li> I like things that are natural and this product is really great. It is great to put it on right after your shower.&lt;br /&gt;What is awesome about this is the seller. She makes sure that everything is perfect and that you know how to use the products.&lt;br /&gt;If any questions or problems she answers them immediately.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my favorite sellers and I will follow her products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never really user any body oils at all, but have always heard about them and their hydration benefits over creams. So I&#x27;ve decided to give this a try. My feedback: overall great feel and texture. Not sticky or smelly. I like how the smell its neutral. I sometimes even use for massages. It helps keep my skin hydrated and nourished. Overall, great product and definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> It is soothing after bathing.  Seems to penetrate skin.  I need to use it again to give a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Love this oil so far. It makes my skin feel wonderful and doesn&#x27;t have too much of a residue after use. I also think it gives the skin a beautiful healthy glow. It came packaged really well in a leak proof bag and the product also had a lovely drawstring sheer mesh bag which would be nice if using as a gift.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I can use it all over my body and it does not look greasy at all. The thing I love about this product is you can apply all over and you can&#x27;t smell it at all. It makes my skin smoother and look good :) I just bought 3 more sublime products today because I love the results for my skin :)</li>
    <li> I put this on after I shower and it really leaves my skin feeling soft all day.  I especially like to use it after I exfoliate.  My skin just drinks it up.  The fact that it is natural oils is a very important added plus.  I also love that you don&#x27;t need a lot so the bottle will last for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
    <li> Really nice product. Keeps skin very moist. Love that it is all natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;It is very much like putting oil directly on your skin, so if that doesn&#x27;t appeal to you,&lt;br /&gt;might not be the right product for you. My skin is soooooo dry (menopause) so&lt;br /&gt;it soaks right up.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice body oil.  I like that it is made of all natural oils and is fragrance free.  With my skin getting on in years having a body oil that hydrates my skin... and is natural, is very much appreciated.  I feel great after I put it on knowing it is nourishing my skin throughout the day.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I was given this item free for review. I was impressed with how quickly it arrived, and how nice it was packaged. When I opened the box, the bottle was wrapped in a pretty blue, silky meshed bag with a ribbon. Perfect for gift giving! I enjoyed the fact that even tho it&#x27;s an oil, it wasn&#x27;t too greasy feeling, and it smelled nice too! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Came in good packaging for gift giving and had very little oily smell.  It left a little residue on skin but was good for my skin type since I have very dry skin.</li>
    <li> This daily beauty oil from Sublime Beauty gets 5 stars from me! I love the way I feel after applying it. I apply right after I get out of the shower using a bit more on problem areas like knees, heels, and elbows. A little of this product goes a long way, so it is a bargain. I love that there&#x27;s not a strong scent, so I can still wear my own perfume and it not be overkill. This product is not greasy or oily like some of the other brands out there. My skin is about 75% softer and firmer.... I have only been applying for about a month! My hubby even complimented my skin saying it is so soft! I&#x27;m hiding from my teenage daughters bc  once they find out this beautiful silky smooth skin secret in a bottle, they will take mine! I guess I know one thing I&#x27;ll be getting them for their birthdays this year! Thanks Sublime Beauty!</li>
    <li> I really liked this body oil.I was impressed by the beautiful taffeta bag that it arrived in.It was very pretty and lady like.I liked the fact that it had a little round thinghy to keep the oil from leaking out.It also felt great on my dry dry skin.Made my skin feel smooth.This is my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Best skin product I&#x27;ve tried. So happy that I found this product o line. This oil leaves my skin wonderfully hydrated &amp; soft to touch. It doesn&#x27;t have a overbearing scent that clashes with perfumes. In a pinch it makes a good hair oil &amp; was gentle enough for me to use on my face. Love this oil. Will definitely buy again !</li>
    <li> I am pleasantly surprised by how well this body oil has worked out for me and my husband.  I ordered it because I was intrigued by the five oils listed on the product page, but I was also a little concerned that it would feel oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it turned out, it does not feel oily at all, and it smooths my hands, elbows and heels really well.  I thought I had to use it nightly like I had to with most other moisturizers, so it was a pleasant surprise that I didn&#x27;t have to since it works so well.  That&#x27;s definitely an added benefit since I am lazy about applying moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also glad that it not scented, so my husband doesn&#x27;t mind using it on his dry heels.  His heels tend to dry out so much that his doctor recommended that he use Eucerin every night.  It may not be a bad product, but it is thick, pasty and takes some work to rub it into the skin, so needless to say, he does not use it often.  After a week of using this body oil, which spreads so easily, his heels have visibly improved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would have liked to see done differently is the spout.  It would have been perfect if it was drip-free, like what you see with most cooking oil bottles.  I don&#x27;t know if a small container like this can be made with a drip-free spout, but that would be a nice feature to have in the future.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin especially during cold weather. I have been using this body oil on my legs and feet and its done great. It leaves my skin soft and silky feeling without leaving them feeling greasy or icky like other oils I have used. It also smells great. I love that its all natural and doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin. I&#x27;m glad I received a sample of this to try and review.</li>
    <li> Really love this oil.  Feels good on skin &amp; no fragrance!  Seller does a great job &amp; always follows up.  Can&#x27;t beat the service.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. My skin feels so hydrated and it has a nice light scent.</li>
    <li> This oil is great.  It absorbs easily and leaves your skin feeling soft not oily.  Use sparingly - a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This oil is the best oil I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Sublime Body Oil&lt;br /&gt;has all the oils that I want. It feels light and non-greasy. My skin feels warm after applying it. It has a hint of almond scent. I like that they put vitamin E in this concoction. The bottle is placed in a matching little blue drawstring bag, nice touch. I will be using this daily.</li>
    <li> Like no other! I&#x27;ve been suffering with ashy skin for many months now (believed to be due to menopause).  I&#x27;ve tried several oils, but none lasted for more than an hour and the dry skin would return.  This is the first oil that has kept my skin soft for the whole day, without being greasy!  I almost didn&#x27;t purchase it due to the price. However, since it got such great reviews, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  I&#x27;m really glad I did.  This is the BEST!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this every night since I have received it. My skin feels like pure silk.  Not like over the counter oils at all.  I rub this into my skin and wait just a minute or two and literally get in bed to sleep. Normally I would not do that with other oil products because of my sheets.  If you want a super soft and smooth clean look on your skin you gotta try this.  Thanks again Sublime.&lt;br /&gt;Sherri</li>
    <li> My skin is so dry in the winter. I put this on after a shower an skin looks so much better. My legs get very dry so this has helped me!</li>
    <li> I live in Ohio where it has been extremely cold this year and the weather has taken a toll on not only my skin, but my husbands and my sons as well.  We have all been suffering from dry, itchy skin and lotion wasn&#x27;t helping.  I was given the opportunity to test all natural body oil from Sublime Beauty and it has worked wonders on my skin and my families.  My legs and hands were my problem spot, within two days my skin looked and felt amazing.  My legs were no longer scaly and no more itching.  My skin instantly soaked up the oil for the first few days so I could tell how badly my skin needed the it  Now I use it daily and don&#x27;t have to use as much now that my skins moisture has been replenished.&lt;br /&gt;My son has small dry spots all over his torso and they went away after a couple days of me covering him with body oil after bathing.  My husband puts the oil on his hands at night and then wears gloves, it has healed his hands.  He works in the cold and was suffering from deep cracks and sores all over his hands from the cold, it was painful and nothing was working to heal it.  It took about four days of using sublime beauty body oil and his skin began to heal.&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a small amount of oil, a little goes a long way.  I love the way it smells and plan on continue to find new uses for it.  I have tried it in my hair and as long as its not applied to the roots it works well without any greasiness or weighing down and its an amazing massage oil.  This is an awesome body oil and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use the oil every day after I shower and at night before I go to bed on my hands and feet to keep my skin super soft. It does not have a smell so it is a great product for those of you who are sensitive to smells on oils or lotions. It is all natural and I have been getting a lot of compliments on the way that my skin looks and feels after using this oil.</li>
    <li> I have never used body oil so was willing to give it a shot to try out. I usually used lotion or body butter to keep my skin hydrated. After getting out of the shower, I massaged this all over my body.It really did hydrate my body and made my skin feel really soft. I really am liking this product. Especially since summer is coming, I feel like this will be great when my skin starts to get dry.</li>
    <li> I plan on using this to make bath bombs and other items, it&#x27;s a great mixture.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I have had a body oil that I have used my whole life, as well as my mother and her mother. Many years ago they discontinued the product, and my family stocked up. Well a short time ago I noticed that I was on my last bottle!! I was worried I would not find a product that I liked as well. I mean 3 generations of the same body oil, I wanted to find something that was similar if not better than what I was using before. Well ladies and gentlemen, after a few weeks of looking, I have to tell you that this is the body oil I am going to stick with. Not only did I get a great price, but the ingredients are all natural and you don’t get left with an oily feeling, but a clean soft feeling instead! I just had to let all of you know!! So if you are looking for a body oil that you can use everyday, then try this, I promise you wont be disappointed!</li>
    <li> this is an awesome oil to use. its not to oily</li>
    <li> really like this.&lt;br /&gt;great price,&lt;br /&gt;soaks in fast.&lt;br /&gt;great smell</li>
    <li> This body oil goes on smoothly, it gives you a natural glow  Some times I combine this with my self tanning lotion, it glides on amazingly,  I definately recommend this product</li>
    <li> When I was first applying this after the shower, I felt like I had to use a large amount to get the job done.  However, even after a couple days, my skin was still soft.  And I hadn&#x27;t used as much as I thought.  I like that the light smell fades quickly so it doesn&#x27;t clash with perfume.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> perfect for after shower daily</li>
    <li> I had some trouble spots on my knee and elbow, they are now smooth and hydrated. I love that there is no over powering scent to it, I like to use it right after I shower and love how my skin feels, silky smooth every time. No irritants or smells to worry about  just smooth soft skin</li>
    <li> I would give this body oil a million stars if I could!!! I&#x27;ve been dry brushing my skin for quite a while. I have tried at least five different oils designed for use with skin brushing. Sublime&#x27;s oil blows all of the other oils out of the water!!! There is no fragrance to deal with. The oil will leave your skin feeling like satin. It is not greasy just uber moisturizing!!! If you want skin that looks wonderful all day long-give this a try. I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin too, and this has not been a problem with Sublime&#x27;s oil,</li>
    <li> this product is really wonderful.. Been working for my skin. I never use lotion on my body only oil and this definitely belongs to one of my collections...</li>
    <li> This is A Great Body oil! I really like this oil as it does not have any smell to it and it soaks in pretty fast! Got it a few days ago &amp; I&#x27;m really glad I got to try this for my honest unbiased opinion! I was pretty impressed as I took it out of the box as it came well packaged put in a tissue silk blue drawstring bag. As far as the oil goes I Love it, It&#x27;s great as it has helped me a lot with my dry scaly winter skin. My skin is well moisturized now &amp; I&#x27;m not itchy anymore due to the dryness! The All-Natural Daily Body Oil from Sublime Beauty is hands down the best I ever tried. Love It!</li>
    <li> Ooooh - All-Natural Daily Body Oil is terrific!  I use it daily and it has kept my skin  soft and silky. It&#x27;s a must have if you have dry skin.</li>
    <li> Awesome Sauce man this is great stuff. I got this on a promotion in excange for my opinion and honest review. I just love it. This rehydrates my skin and makes it glow. I get very bad dry skin. It itches and gets red. This really takes the edge off of the itch and makes it smooth. I noticed on my legs I have lost some o the bumps. That is a plus! I am so glad I got to try this I want more of it! I am going to be using this for a lng time. One happy customer here.</li>
    <li> This body oil is spot on. Not greasy like alot of other oils. Has really helped my rough spots on my elbows. I use it right out of the shower.</li>
