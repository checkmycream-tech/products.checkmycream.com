      <li>okay what I&#x27;m about to upgrade to</li>

      <li>Sometimes I rub it in, but most of the time I&#x27;ll just spray it on and let it sit.</li>
      <li>I love to spray this stuff on my bald head after shaving it.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
      <li>As soon as I finish shaving, dry off and apply the magic potion to your problem shaving areas!!  </li>
      <li>This is the first thing that ACTUALLY worked, and I was so happy I could cry.</li>
      <li>and they are a great compliment for each other.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s like aftershave for girls, or for guys who want something more natural.</li>
      <li>Okay, I went in as a complete skeptic regarding this product and ingrown hairs.</li>
      <li>, I may have missed a weekend or two, but I&#x27;ve been pretty much using it every day.</li>

      <li>My main issues with shaving is the bikini area...</li>
      <li>Turns out that what I thought was gonna take 6 months to clear up - took about 3 months.</li>
      <li>this tea tree oil combo is just a big wow factor!!  </li>
      <li>Maybe for the first few weeks I would check on the progress back there, and even though I didn&#x27;t see any results, I just soldiered on using the spray - and I even stopped checking on the progress... until this</li>
      <li>There is enough alcohol in this that it does burn, however not enough to dry out my sensitive skin with 2x daily use.&lt;br</li>

<li> I have tried to get him to try other things, but he refuse to....</li>
<li> I mean, I didn&#x27;t have Ving Rhames blotches, but I did have acne on the back of my neck - dark, blotty acne...</li>
<li> The smell isn&#x27;t too harsh IMO.</li>
<li> Because I have thick, curly hair, immediately after a haircut, or even after I shave the back of my neck for maintenance, I get these nasty, annoying, bumps on the back of my neck, and since I have an olive complexion, the bumps turn into a dark scare tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> : it smells rather terrible, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for something that finally provided relief.</li>
<li> Been using for a while and hate to say it but not noticing a difference yet.</li>
<li> I get horrible shaving bumps in the summer, and this year they even came from waxing!</li>

    <li> I absolutely love this product.  Great for more than just razor bumps and ingrown hairs.  Also works on pimples and helps my psoriasis.</li>
    <li> My Husband loves this stuff, this is all he uses and have been for some years. I have tried to get him to try other things, but he refuse to....</li>
    <li> Been using for a while and hate to say it but not noticing a difference yet.</li>
    <li> excellent product. i recommend spraying this on after you shave, or line up your hair. really prevents bumps</li>
    <li> My husband loves this as after shave!</li>
    <li> This product works very well on ensuring that no bumps are on my face</li>
    <li> I love to spray this stuff on my bald head after shaving it.  It works very well.  I noticed that the ingrown hairs and razor bumps have lessened.</li>
    <li> Okay, I went in as a complete skeptic regarding this product and ingrown hairs. Because I have thick, curly hair, immediately after a haircut, or even after I shave the back of my neck for maintenance, I get these nasty, annoying, bumps on the back of my neck, and since I have an olive complexion, the bumps turn into a dark scare tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my barber (who knows a thing or two about ingrown hair) suggested that I use this Tea Tree anti-bump spray on the back of my neck because of the severe ingrown hairs I get back there. It turns out, the cat knows what he&#x27;s talking about!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this bottle in February of 2014, and I&#x27;ve used this product almost every day since, granted, I may have missed a weekend or two, but I&#x27;ve been pretty much using it every day. Maybe for the first few weeks I would check on the progress back there, and even though I didn&#x27;t see any results, I just soldiered on using the spray - and I even stopped checking on the progress... until this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray the back of my neck with about 5 blasts, every morning as soon as I get out of the shower. Sometimes I rub it in, but most of the time I&#x27;ll just spray it on and let it sit. Turns out that what I thought was gonna take 6 months to clear up - took about 3 months. I mean, I didn&#x27;t have Ving Rhames blotches, but I did have acne on the back of my neck - dark, blotty acne... which kinda hacked away at my self esteem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like I&#x27;m a lifelong devotee of the Tea Tree Anti-bump Spray, and if you&#x27;re a skeptic just as I was, I challenge YOU to take the 3 month challenge! You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I dont shave with a razor that much but if I do I immediately have to spray this on my face and it works</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with persistent ingrown hairs. This has been great at eliminating and reducing them. The smell isn&#x27;t too harsh IMO. Good price too.</li>
    <li> It has not worked for me.  My bumps persist.</li>
    <li> I use this as a follow up to applying thier tea tree anti bump cream following epilation. Its good because throughout the day i can refresh my skin with a spray as needed. Ive experienced no ingrown hairs or bumps since using this and the cream.</li>
    <li> I get horrible shaving bumps in the summer, and this year they even came from waxing! I&#x27;ve tried every remedy of salicylic acid, glycolic acid, and witch hazel. I switched soaps and exfoliate and moisturize daily; doesn&#x27;t matter, always bumps that get infected. This is the first thing that ACTUALLY worked, and I was so happy I could cry. Shaving or waxing, just cleanse the area after and apply this. I do a few spritzes, then rub it in really well with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: it smells rather terrible, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for something that finally provided relief. There is enough alcohol in this that it does burn, however not enough to dry out my sensitive skin with 2x daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like aftershave for girls, or for guys who want something more natural. THANK YOU so much for this product. I give it my most enthusiastic recommendation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it has worked wonders.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm as always.... I use it along with Tend Skin and they are a great compliment for each other.</li>
    <li> Seriously, hands down this is the best product ever!!  I&#x27;ve tried everything and this tea tree oil combo is just a big wow factor!!  My main issues with shaving is the bikini area...I was so floored by this product, it worked immediately!!  I&#x27;m more confident, no razor burn, no itching, no embarrassments!  As soon as I finish shaving, dry off and apply the magic potion to your problem shaving areas!!  I love the spray, covers an area perfectly!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I use it on my face and head (I am bald and shave my head).  It works better than a product I was paying almost 3 times the money for.</li>
    <li> okay what I&#x27;m about to upgrade to</li>
    <li> Arrived as described and by the date promised</li>
</ol>
