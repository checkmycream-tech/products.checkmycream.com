      <li>I have been using this perfume for nearly two years and it is wonderful.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells nice...scent does not last long!</li>
    <li> Omg does this smell good!!! I&#x27;ve heard so many rave reviews of this particular scent so when I saw this for $23.99 instead of the $30 MSRP, I went ahead and ordered this on a whim without having ever tested or even smelled it before. That might seem kinda crazy, but boy am I glad I took the chance on this one!&lt;br /&gt;First off, the bottle itself is ridiculously cute and is going to look great in my bathroom with my decor.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it smells absolutely divine! I tend to gravitate toward scents that are typically more masculine, and this really fits the bill for me. The vanilla is the strongest note here but the wood and orchid notes really even it out to a point where it doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; or over bearing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a complex scent yet it comes off effortless, and while it lasts quite a long time it settles softly and subtly. It won&#x27;t leave a trail of gag enducing air around you.&lt;br /&gt;This perfume is a complete win for me and I&#x27;m so glad I ordered it! Now I know what all the hype is about!</li>
    <li> Vanilla tobacco scent that keeps me sniffing my wrist, not an insipid sweet scent.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of Tokyo Milk products for some time, and this is my favorite scent. I wear it daily! I was very excited to find it for a great price, delivered fast, online!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and what I expected from the product. Love the scent. This is by far my favorite from the Tokyo Milk brand. My boyfriend also uses it to mix with some of his other perfumes to make his own signature scent.</li>
    <li> I love the smell...it&#x27;s another one that I&#x27;m not a fan of as soon as I smell it, but once it&#x27;s been on about 10 minutes, it&#x27;s heavenly. It goes on smelling woody and earthy, which is fine, but once it settles, i can smell a heavy, spicy vanilla and that&#x27;s the scent I love. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long on me and that&#x27;s the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Otherwise, it&#x27;s wonderful and if you&#x27;re the sort of person that wears a musk well, go for it.</li>
    <li> I love this Scent! I feel its Unisex! Not Everyone will be wearing this, so the hallways aren&#x27;t flooded w/patchouli!\ ••Remember••if doesn&#x27;t blend with your body&#x27;s natural oils, don&#x27;t spray on skin</li>
    <li> Found this in canada and found here. Delivered timely and exactly what I ordered. Wonderful musky scent and might even try another scent.</li>
    <li> I found this perfume while at a spa while on vacation and fell in love with it. It&#x27;s earthy and warm and lasts all day long.  And it&#x27;s very affordable!</li>
    <li> It was just as I expected! Same fragrance, same bottle as I saw it in a store!  Love it!  Delivery time was excellent!&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints!</li>
    <li> Great parfume. I have purchased it locally before.</li>
    <li> Smells real dead sexy. Just as described. Can be strong - but I love it!</li>
    <li> Just got this perfume and I love it! It&#x27;s long lasting and smells very exotic / oriental. It may be my new favorite.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrence....very sexy.</li>
    <li> I first discovered Tokyo Milk earlier this year, but only tried the perfumes until now. There&#x27;s a local store that sells them here and I went in to test each one (each one they had in stock, that is). Dead Sexy was by far my favorite. Everyone&#x27;s different of course, so I recommend purchasing it in person first.</li>
    <li> Light and clean fragrance.  Most definitely my favorite of any I have ever tried.  Great price.</li>
    <li> I was always fickle when it came to scent until I found Dead Sexy by Tokyo Milk. I have been wearing this scent religiously for 6 years and not a day goes by that someone doesn&#x27;t tell me how good I smell. Scent is all about chemistry of course, so every individual needs to find the scent that works for them. Hint, if you can smell it on yourself, it probably isn&#x27;t the scent for you. Tokyo Milk has some other amazing scents, so give them a try!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this!!!  Glad I found it on Amazon.  I purchase regularly.</li>
    <li> This does not smell or last like the version I purchased in a store. It also came without a box.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe I received the true fragrance, but a possible knock off instead.</li>
    <li> Even though the parfume smells close to right, it doesn&#x27;t hold very long at all which leads me to believe that the vial was tempered with (diluted). It is a popular practice for parfume counterfeiters. They buy one bottle of real stuff and sell 5 bottles of their own or however else they do it. No-one would believe me if I tried to return it, oh well.</li>
    <li> Although I love the bottle and vanilla base notes, this perfume is a tad strong. It is hard to describe what it smells of at first spray, I cannot detect the wood notes but once it dissipates it is a strong vanilla musk. I cannot go anywhere for a at least an hour once it is sprayed without a nose crinkling telling me it is too strong. I use one pump. I was pleased with the seller, just not that excited with the perfume.</li>
    <li> Love the vanilla in this perfume. It very different than the department store scents; much more earthy.&lt;br /&gt;Great order process!</li>
    <li> Love the perfumes from this company. # 13 is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. People will track me down to tell me how good I smell. Definitely a winner, pretty much anything from this brand is on point.</li>
    <li> I love it...I wish they made bigger bottles</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product and it doesn&#x27;t wear off.  I also love the lotion they sell with this scent.</li>
    <li> Love this, my all time favorite. Nice spice notes.</li>
    <li> I like the parfum very much. But the packaging was very messy. I had ordered two and only receivied one. And it was not in a box. It was wrapped in bubble wrap and it looked like the pacgage had been open and then rewrapped. Amazon did give me credit for the missing bottle.</li>
    <li> HATE the bottle. Every time I try to use it in my purse, it pours out. Would it kill them to attach the spray nozzle? Or make a bigger size?</li>
    <li> That is what my supervisor smelled when we opened the package and sniffed the bottle.  In reality, this is a very smooth vanilla woods perfume and it can be pretty potent so wear with care.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it seems to have a lot of alcohol in it and it doesn&#x27;t last very long on me.  But I fixed that by moisurizing with body oil post shower and then spraying the perfume on.  It has lasted longer today than it has in the past two days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this fragrance for my wife for about 10 years now. Not only does it not make her smell like an old French whore, it made from all natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a new scent ever since MAC discontinued making the one I had worn for 10 years! I absolutely LOVE Dead Sexy!!! It&#x27;s sweet, spicy, &amp; musky... It is long lasting and, for my taste, it is not over-whelming. My girls were skeptical that I wouldn&#x27;t \\&quot;smell like mommy\\&quot; but they gave it four thumbs up! Yes it does go on strong but it blends very nicely with my chemistry and leaves a lovely scent. I have found my new \\&quot;scent identity\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> I thought I would try a new scent... something a bit androgynous. This is definitely androgynous, and sultry, but I like it best paired with a sweet floral scent. You could absolutely wear it alone though and it smells pretty good. I&#x27;ve been wearing it daily and applying it at &amp;#34;pulse points&amp;#34; but I still find it fades quickly, which surprised me because every review I read said it was long-wearing.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. The lotion is a little better, but the perfume is good stuff too. Vanilla, without being overpowering/smelling like a pastry.</li>
    <li> OMIGOSH I love the smell!!!!</li>
    <li> Yet another win for Tokyo Milk.&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of the more spicy scents and this did not disappoint. While I believe this is meant to be an evening fragrance, I wear it during the day as well. Subtle and not overpowering with a nice vanilla note, not to mention the attractive bottle. A wonderful gift for a lover of complex, dark scents.</li>
    <li> Given as a wish-list gift and much appreciated.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. Great price too. Kind of reminds me of mens cologne with the woodsy scent.  will buy again</li>
    <li> This fragrance lasts forever, it surrounds me in a feminine, yet confident aura, and I will wear it for as long as it is available. Try their sampler sets, too. six atomizers, courageous blends, and you will get asked, even by men, what fragrance are you wearing? No one who wears fragrance could ask for a better compliment than that!</li>
    <li> I have been using this perfume for nearly two years and it is wonderful. I do not care for flowery or fruity perfumes, but this one is a mixture of vanilla, exotic wood, orchid, and ebony.  The mixture of these scents create a deep and complex scent that might was a little bit strong for me at first. However, after wearing it for a week I loved it. I have never had a complaint that it was too strong or that it smelled bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want a girly fruity flowery scent this one is great.</li>
    <li> Literally makes you Dead Sexy...I have had so many men (and women) ask to smell me when I wear this. They take a long, hard whiff and then stars appear in their eyes...&amp;#34;What IS that??&amp;#34; they cry, and I offer a wink, a smile, and a softly whispered &amp;#34;It&#x27;s Dead Sexy...&amp;#34; Gets &#x27;em every time. The best smelling perfume on the market, hands down.</li>
    <li> no vanilla I can detect, just horrible chemical plastic smell that gives me the heeby jeebies...yup, kills my sexy dead. HORRIBLE</li>
    <li> Very nice smelling fragrance, not too sweet but not a clone of any other perfume.  Sweet, but not overwhelming.  Love it.</li>
    <li> The perfume wasn&#x27;t in the box I had seen it in at a boutique. It was wrapped in torn, brownish paper and loosely put in a small bubble wrap baggie. It appeared to have had been opened and the smell was very intense, like it had spilled or something. The perfume was intended as a gift. I won&#x27;t use this vender again.</li>
    <li> I thought it had too strong of a vanilla essence but the more i wear it the more i like it .. Slowly starting to love it.. The dunkin donuts workers went nuts for this scent when i drove through for my morning coffee the first day i wore it. I was surprised they could even smell it through the drive through window with the strong coffee scent in the air but they loved and i have gotten many compliments on it since.</li>
    <li> I was giving up on fragrance. To flowery or sweet for me. I prefer my husbands cologne to mine! But that would not do! Now I have my own unique scent. Makes me think of forests, leather interiors, and for some reason hidden treasure!</li>
    <li> Fabulous, long lasting fragrance.  I carry this in my shop and it does not come sealed or in a box from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> This is a very light Parfum in case y think&lt;br /&gt;Its not I could hardly smell it maybe I got the wrong one&lt;br /&gt;Its pretty but light</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments from friends- even strangers will ask what I&#x27;m wearing that smells so delicious. This sexy fragrance is and has been my favorite for a while.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> Unique scent. Not very long lasting but I love it</li>
    <li> Tokyo Milk Dead Sexy is a wonderful perfume. It has a vanilla smell that is so nice..my husband loves it!  My 23 year old daughter loved it so much that I bought her a bottle for Christmas.</li>
    <li> totally different than what i expected.  smells a little bug sprayish.. i don&#x27;t think this is the real deal.</li>
    <li> I like it OK but I get sick of it too fast and find it annoying. I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to scents so I switch around from on tokyo milk perfume to the other pretty often. It&#x27;s the only perfume I can wear and tolerate.</li>
    <li> This perfume that was mailed to me is NOT the original Tokyo Dead Sexy. It is yellow and smells like alcohol. I contacted amazon for a return. Be aware of this product!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance but it doesn&#x27;t last too long</li>
    <li> Bought this perfume never having smelled it, based on friend&#x27;s recommendations. They were right. Interesting and intriguing sandalwood blend. Prepare for lots of compliments from strangers.</li>
    <li> I love Tokyo Milk but Dead Sexy is not my favorite scent. It is a bit too cloying. Fast shipping. I will definately purchase their other scents.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent of all time, which makes me hesitant to give such a great rating because I like to keep this stuff to myself...but it&#x27;s too good not to give a positive review.  It came on time, and the product was satisfactory.  High five.</li>
    <li> Only reason it&#x27;s not 5 stars is because the bottle top was a little loose in the packaging and a little bit of parfum wound up on my fingers when I opened it. But just a little. Which is good. Because Dead Sexy smells awesome. Just a note- does not smell awesome on everyone- my friend tried it and it was a little odorous on her. Test drive it first.</li>
    <li> love the smell...people ask me about it...but isn&#x27;t this why one gets perfume?  I don&#x27;t what else to write because there is a word minimum for the review LOL</li>
    <li> Came fast and in quality perfect condition! I wear it everyday! Defiantly my favorite smell!</li>
    <li> Product arrived very quickly and I love the scent.</li>
    <li> And I could not be more pleased. I typically wear Egyptian Goddess but wanted something new. I love earthy/more masculine scents and this is perfect! Not too sweet at all. Don&#x27;t be scared that it has vanilla notes... I do NOT wear vanilla anything and this is perfect. It smells smokey, woody and clean. I wish it came in a bigger bottle because I predict this will go fast. I see myself wearing this for years to come.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this scent at  Anthropologie  last year and could not find it and decided to go on the Internet. Lo and behold I found it.</li>
    <li> loved this product, the fragrance is so delectable. Every time I wear it someone comments on it. It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
    <li> I love this Dead sexy perfume...Its sultry and mysterious....The bottle design is fun as well! Great product to own or to give as a gift!</li>
    <li> Love this, its my favorite!!!</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  It&#x27;s actually the forth bottle I&#x27;ve ordered.  The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t last long because it&#x27;s only 1.0 oz and to my knowledge doesn&#x27;t come in a larger size.  bummer.</li>
    <li> Dead Sexy has been my go to perfum for about 4 years now. But have they changed their formula? It smells more chemically than it used to. I still like it, but I don&#x27;t love it as much as I used to.</li>
    <li> I think this perfume smells sweet and nice and simple. It&#x27;s a little powdery and antique smelling. But I kind of like that about it. It doesn&#x27;t try too hard to be REALLY flowery or REALLY musky or REALLY sweet. It&#x27;s a simple scent and kind of old fashioned, or retro. Almost like i got into my grandmas perfumes and mixed a couple together and came up with this. Anyway, thats what it reminds me of. But that&#x27;s a good thing i think. Because my grandma always had tons of really old classy perfumes and I think she&#x27;d like this one if she was still around. I also got the Dead Sexy hand cream and the Dead sexy lip balm. Dont waste your time with those. They&#x27;re not worth the money. TokyoMilk is great for their perfumes but the quality of their other products is mediocre.&lt;br /&gt; Next I am going to get Honey and the Moon perfume because I had a sample of that and I love how honey smells.</li>
    <li> Vanilla musk and not to heavy.  I can&#x27;t get enough of this!! Always get compliments on this Dead Sexy 06.  Guys love it too!</li>
    <li> I love it.  What&#x27;s more important, my husband loves this scent, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the first time I have purchased Dead Sexy nor will it be the last.</li>
    <li> Love this....great price</li>
    <li> This is cool perfume, BUT.....Give yourself time to like it. If you like it well enough, but don&#x27;t love it, like I did, just wear it a couple of times and you&#x27;ll notice that you be able to take in different notes of fragrance each time you do. It really is sandalwoodish. It smells like clean drift wood on a sandy beach with a breeze of light floral notes from time to time. It&#x27;s quite interesting and would probably do well combined with some other scents. I actually combined it with a benefit scent that I had, Carmen, that added a deeply carmel coconut to it...It was some rather nice alchemy. So, this is a unique fragrance, be prepared for that and know that it may take some time to get to know it, and for it to know you.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume on a whim after reading about it on Design Sponge. Crazy, right? Who buys a perfume without ever smelling it? But I lucked out, because this is exactly what I was hoping for -- a warm, earthy, almost smoky vanilla. I love it so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got it, I was alarmed, because just applying one spritz and rubbing it between my wrists was way too strong. I like it when the only people who can smell me are very close to me, you know? And this perfume is potent. I found it works a lot better to spray the air in front of me and step forward into the mist. This way the scent clings but doesn&#x27;t overwhelm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was a little afraid that my husband, who sometimes gets sneezy with strong smells, would have a problem with it, but nope, it&#x27;s fine -- in fact he loves it, too, and I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s ever commented on liking a perfume before. It is a really lovely scent, sexy and sweet and clean.</li>
    <li> Stunning at first but gets boring quickly.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! it is different but kinda reminds me of burberry but a stronger scent in a good way. I hate smelling like an old wet sock and some perfumes just don&#x27;t agree with my chemistry. I give it two thumbs up..and by the way I get many, many compliments.</li>
    <li> I accidentally sprayed this on my hand yesterday...I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling it!  It was intoxicating!  I ran to the store today and picked up a bottle.  It is wonderful! A true over-the-top experience for the senses.&lt;br /&gt;The layers of fragrance are amazing!  Everything was individually familiar, but surprisingly explosive when bottled together!&lt;br /&gt;The label also had me hooked: Dead Sexy, who can resist that?&lt;br /&gt;Buy a bottle, see if you can stop yourself from enveloping your body in a fragrance with such depth and individuality. It&#x27;s all YOU!</li>
    <li> First got it at a shop on vacation. But since we are not there I found it on Amazon. But my wife loves it,</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I order it all of the time.  I will be bummed if they ever stop making it.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance!  It is so light and woodsy.  Although it is manufactured in Denver I cannot find any local stores who carry it.  I receive compliments on this fragrance all the time!  It is my signature scent!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this perfume. It&#x27;s truly a unique scent. It&#x27;s almost addicting. I&#x27;m that girl who goes through tons of perfumes wondering when ill be satisfied with a special one and this is it! Better than Chanel and Clinique.</li>
    <li> Not your average vanilla; sort of bitter, and definitely dark.  Funny that Tainted Love from the &amp;#34;Dark&amp;#34; line pales in comparison to this juice.  That frag is sweet and sort of blah/boring.  I&#x27;ve been wearing Dead Sexy for several years and consistently get the most compliments from guys and gals with this juice; they all insist on sniffing inside my bubble.  If the invasion of personal space offends you, avoid this because most people find it scrumptious.</li>
    <li> Love the perfume however the bottle leaks from the sprayer (while upright).  Not sure why it leaks but the bottle is always oily.  It being oily, the perfume itself is very concentrated and it does smell lovely.  Another downfall is the product was sealed in a clear plastic bag rather than a box.  I didn&#x27;t think anything of this at the time but now wonder if my product was another customer&#x27;s return due to the leaky sprayer.  I would have rated this product five stars had it not been for the leaky sprayer.</li>
    <li> Best smelling perfume ever. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have bought this before from a store and it seemed to be stronger. It seems like this had more alcohol in it then there should be.</li>
    <li> I have to say this is probably my most favorite perfume i&#x27;ve ever owned. discovered it in a specialty boutique and fell in love. it tops any designer brand i&#x27;ve ever used, i even prefer it to chanel. its such a unique scent, and it doesnt smell like your regular old department store perfume. if youre questioning on if to buy it or not, just go for it. its so rich, warm, sexy, and unique, my only complaint is I wish it was available in a bigger bottle!</li>
    <li> My review is not based on the true Tokyo Milk&#x27;s Dead Sexy, my review is based on this seller&#x27;s product.&lt;br /&gt;I have a bottle that was purchased from Tokyo Milk&#x27;s website. I received this new bottle as a gift from my husband and the difference between the two is astounding. The original&#x27;s fragrance to me is so wonderful and has been a favorite of mine for a couple of years now. This seller&#x27;s product doesn&#x27;t compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appearances: The bottles are the same in appearance but the bottle from this seller was leaking perfume from the seal near the sprayer and there are bits of...well..brown pieces of something floating in the bottle of perfume itself. It also arrived without a box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: Just smelling the sprayers is a noticeable difference. The original bottle is very strong, kind of a smoky smell. This bottle smells of alcohol and a hint of the original fragrance. When put on, the original is very strong on my skin and leaves a long-lasting trail. It permeates the area quickly and smells quite heavy. When the new fragrance is put on, I smell strongly of alcohol that fades into a much more watered-down and demure version of Dead Sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I am greatly disappointed to think that my husband was tricked into buying a product that isn&#x27;t an original or full-strength. I will keep the bottle and will wear it as it was a gift from him. However I will be directing his future perfume purchases to the official Tokyo Milk store. Better to pay a few dollars more for the real thing.</li>
    <li> This is a great smell. It is different. I usually wear Lola by Marc Jacobs. I don&#x27;t smell much Vanilla, I do get a lot of licorice. Reminds me of being out camping, or in a small, smokey bar at night I don&#x27;t think this is a young smell, it is mature and calming almost.</li>
    <li> I almost always have to buy this product online somewhere. It is my favourite scent &amp; I know have the complete set.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. I think it does not last long enough though.</li>
    <li> Love it but it didn&#x27;t come on the bottle wasnt entirely full?</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife as a christmas gift. OMG does this stuff smell amazing. I&#x27;ve been following my wife around just to get a whiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appears to be a mostly natural product as far as I can see.</li>
    <li> All of these perfumes are fantastic but Dead Sexy is still my fave.  If you&#x27;re looking for some great long lasting perfume, I highly recommend.</li>
