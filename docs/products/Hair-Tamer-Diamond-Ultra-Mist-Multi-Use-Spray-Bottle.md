<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This little bottle creates a very fine pleasant mist.  From.  I use it for everything from misting clothing while ironing to grooming my hair. The pump seems to be of a very good Quality and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.  The texture of the bottle is very pleasant to the touch creating a comfortable grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is very ergonomic and the spray is produced with ease.  While the trigger is firm it is very easy to create a nice fine mist perfect for wetting hair for grooming or cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife also likes the design of the inlay that gives it a very sophisticated professional look. The inlay includes what looks like Crystals though i am certain they are not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product for home or salon use.</li>
    <li> This spray bottle is easy to use, has a very fine wetting mist, is lightweight even when filled and lastly, is cutely decorative.  You can direct the ultra mist to a specific area without it spraying in unwanted area&#x27;s or over saturating an area due to the ultra mist.  It feels comfortable in your hands without being bulky or heavy due to material it constructed out of, even when totally filled.  The slight curve fits nicely in the palm of your hand, and if desired you can turn the nozzle in the other direction and the flat end feels just as comfortable in your palm, if you have a smaller grip.  Definitely a great item!</li>
    <li> I love how this bottle sprays. This bottle lets out the perfect amount of water for cutting hair. Upon using this bottle for a few minutes, I can tell this bottle will last longer than other bottles I&#x27;ve used in the past. The trigger mechanism is very solid and didn&#x27;t seem to be loose at all. The bottle design is also a great feature about this bottle. I&#x27;m not a fan of the diamonds, but the back of it has a really soft black rubber texture that is very comfortable to the touch. I&#x27;m excited to use this bottle for the years to come.</li>
    <li> Love this bottle! The bottle itself is very comfortable and has a great grip due to the material its made of! Not slippery at all! It mists the hair without soaking it in one spot. There is also enough room so you don&#x27;t pinch your finger on the trigger. this bottle looks wonderful for those that like a little sparkle without it being to overdone!</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a spray bottle for the sole purpose is misting, then this is the one for you!  To start, the design is adorable and comfortable.  I have had many spray bottles in my lifetime that claim they have a &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; setting. I could never adjust these bottles to get the perfect mist.  This spray bottle has only one setting- to mist, and it does just that! The water is evenly distributed and uses the right amount of water. When I used it to lightly wet my hair so I could restyle it with my hair dryer, I was so happy that my hair had the perfect amount of moisture, not drenched! I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I received this product free of charge as part of SalonGuys&#x27; Market Research Program and do state that I wasn&#x27;t expecting this spray bottle to be anything spectacular. A spray bottle can&#x27;t be anything more than just precisely that, right? Not quite... Not when it comes to do with this fine bling of a product anyway...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the feel of the bottle is very fancy! It&#x27;s super velvety and goes very well with the bling theme - richly smooth and pleasant to hold with a guaranteed firm grip as you spritz your hair away to superstardom. I really enjoy the feel and noticed that the bottle is made out of a plastic material that could be squeezed accordingly. I appreciate how the nozzle head could be turned 360 degrees to your convenience but most importantly, LOVE the misty quality of the water sprayed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a hair detangler formula from Victoria&#x27;s Secret that comes in a spray bottle and thought that the spray it emits is of nice quality, but after using this bottle I&#x27;ve come to realize that it&#x27;s the ultimate Spray Bottle Bling Queen. Not only does this bottle spray quite effortlessly, but the range of one single spray is impressive! What I find most important is that the hair is not drenched given its delicately light mist. Never did I think that there could be such stark differences amongst spray bottles...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I highly recommend this spray bottle, for just one spray goes a really long way. This would be super important in cases where you would want to maximize the effects and prolong the duration of liquid hair formulas that might be a bit on the costly side. As one reviewer commented, this bottle may indeed be on the expensive side, but in the long run it would be more on the cost effective side when one thinks of how long their liquid hair formulas would last (or even water, if that would be an issue for some...).</li>
    <li> This ultra mist spray bottle works very well. The rounded bottle shape fits well in the hand, and the rubberized plastic provides good grip. The mist it creates is very fine and even--no splattering or dripping. The nozzle remains tight without dripping or leaking. This would work well to remove static electricity from a variety of things, including hair (no more frizz!) and clothing. It would even work quite well to mist plants. The only reason that this product did not receive five stars was due to price vs. value; despite its solid performance, it does seem that one could find something comparable for slightly less.</li>
    <li> I received this bottle as a part of a product review program so I can&#x27;t complain about the price. It has a nice feel, it is very smooth and feels like a fine velvet. The design is very appealing--my daughter snatched it when she saw me unpacking it and I could see the sparkles of excitement in her eyes. It fits nicely in my hand and produces a very fine mist that will be good for both hair and plants.&lt;br /&gt;I think the person who appreciates the bottle most in our family is my son who has always hair sticking out on his head in the morning. I used to take water in my hands and tap it on the hair, which always upset him because he would have water running down his neck. This fine mist is much more pleasant and fun.</li>
    <li> I love the added character to this mister bottle! The pink and diamond accents make this one stand out from the rest. You can use it for re-wetting hair, tanning, etc. I haven&#x27;t noticed any leaking from it and the bottle fits nicely into your hand. It&#x27;s slim enough to fit into a bag for travel. I also find that it keeps the water cooler for longer since it isn&#x27;t see-through like a majority of the spray bottles out there.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It feels great in the hand and has a decent spray. I highly recommend! Also is compact and easy to add to a travel kit.</li>
    <li> This review is for the Pink Diamond Ultra Mist Multi-Use Spray Bottle. This product lives up to its name and delivers a super fine mist which I find to be fabulous. So many spray bottles deliver a heavy spray or a stream, which makes them hard to control. This bottle allows you to gradually build up to the level of moisture you desire. I used it with water to dampen my hair before styling on second day hair. The bottle itself is textured,For those of you who are crafty, the feel of it kind of reminds me of fun foam, It&#x27;s soft and smooth, I like sparkle and the bling on the pink section of the bottle made me smile. It also comes with a removable clip to lock the spray trigger. I liked this feature as well and can see that it would be useful for travel. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, thumbs way up for this product. I received this product free of charge from Salon Guys in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> This spray bottle is perfect and exactly what I needed!  I love the colors pink and black and I also like the fact that it is a fancy diva style rhinestone bottle.  The nozzle does not leak as far as I can tell like so many other spray bottles I have purchased. This pretty bottle is durable and is light weight. If you spritz or spray your hair, you would enjoy this spray bottle. The fact that the bottle is small makes good for traveling.  I have gotten so many compliments from this bottle and I am sure you will too!!</li>
    <li> This spray bottle works great. It gives out a good stream of water, it appears well made rather than cheap and crappy. It has a nice mist (which is the only type of spray this particular type does.) The colors and little bit of rhinestone bling on the base make it cute (while also creating a better grip so it is less likely to slip) and can even work as a small gift for your friends. This item works well and does not seem to be the type of item that will break easily. The bottle does have a little thing to lock under the trigger so that it will not spray unexpectedly which is always nice to have.</li>
    <li> This spray bottle is just the most adorable thing to have on your counter!  If you’re a girl that likes a little glitz then this will be perfect for you.  The capacity of the bottle is on the smaller side, but that will keep it light for everyday use.  It is comfortable to hold and the material on the outside definitely feels like it will hold your grip.  This spray bottle is strictly a misting spray bottle as it does not have any knob settings to control.  It did produce a large mist so that will ensure even distribution.  I did not notice any leaking or dripping from the nozzle, and there is a little lock mechanism included but that part is so small and is a separate piece so I can see this easily getting lost.  Overall I am quite pleased with this!</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how well the Hair Tamer spray bottle worked. I did not expect much at first since most spray bottles just spray big droplets instead of a fine mist. I always disliked the original bottle that my heat protection spray came in, so I transferred my heat protection spray from its original bottle to the Heat Tamer spray bottle. The spray from the Heat Tamer spray bottle was so much better than the original spray bottle of my heat protection spray. It sprayed a fine mist that was distributed evenly throughout my hair. The only thing I’m worried about is the lock that comes with the spray bottle. I’m afraid that I might lose it since it’s small and it completely detaches from the spray bottle. Other than that minor con, this spray bottle is great and does what it claims to!</li>
    <li> SalonGuys sent me an assorted pack of free sample items to review that included this adorable sprayer. I really really liked this bottle. The mist is very fine and the attractive no-slip rubberized surface works well.  Only quibble with the bottle itself is I that wish it were larger. The bad news is that while I happen to love this little puppy, I actually got mine for free. At the excessive current selling price of 14.99 there is absolutely no way I could ever recommend it to others. Not anyone I liked, or even strangers for that matter. Fifteen bucks for a plastic sprayer with a (by its very nature) limited lifespan?  No way. Not even for this little cutie pie.</li>
    <li> First off let me comment on the exterior features of this bottle.  It is black all around with a pink strip with small sparkly gems down the front which adds a touch of not only color but flair to make this spray bottle a styling accessory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material the base of the bottle is covered in makes it quite comfortable and secure to grip.  I&#x27;m never afraid that it will slip out my hands if they&#x27;re a bit slick from water or product that I&#x27;ve just put in the hair.  It&#x27;s not a small bottle but it&#x27;s also not large.  In my opinion it is just right, which is a definite plus to me because bottles that are too big easily get to heavy and/or unwieldy while you&#x27;re trying to style hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trigger for the spray nozzle is well built, it doesn&#x27;t flex, bend or seem like it&#x27;s about to break as I&#x27;ve often found cheaper spray bottles do.  It pulls back smoothly and isn&#x27;t to easy to pull back, neither is it too hard.  Again this is another plus.  The spray itself is a fine mist with no adjustment required, which is a definite plus for a few reasons.  First there is no way to adjust the setting of the nozzle spray.  Second I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s very difficult with some spray bottles to get the spray just right.  If it&#x27;s too direct you wind up with the hair you&#x27;re trying to style gets too wet and you&#x27;re back to the blow dryer temporarily.  This bottle sprays a very fine mist that is amazing when styling hair, especially with curling hair as you want hair that you&#x27;re trying to curl with a curling iron to just be ever so slightly moist.  This bottle definitely does that job, the mist is so fine you can easily control how damp you get the hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars all around because of both the look and performance of this bottle.  I received this bottle as part of a product review program and try to keep my reviews as fair, honest, and unbiased as possible.  That being said I think all the features of this spray bottle make it a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I got the black spray bottle and it definitely looks even better in person than in the pics! It&#x27;s got a soft matte coating and the sparkles are small enough to not be obnoxious. I have had a hard time finding cute spray bottles that aren&#x27;t plastered with logos, so this is a nice change! I wish it was a bit bigger so it could hold more water, but the fine mist is nice so I&#x27;m just wetting hair, not giving my clients a bath.</li>
    <li> I used this micro mist bottle when styling my hair. It&#x27;s the perfect size and sets comfortably in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is very attractive.  I&#x27;m not sure how many colors it comes in, but I have the one trimmed in pink.  It has a professional look with a touch of femininity.&lt;br /&gt;The product does exactly what it&#x27;s intended to do.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because there is no way to control the spray that come out.  It&#x27;s a wide angled mist which is not exactly to my liking. I prefer a nozzle that allows you to increase&lt;br /&gt;or decrease the misting area. Although it doesn&#x27;t fit my ideal spray bottle, it definitely does what it says and I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> This bottle shape makes it easy to hold on to. The &amp;#34;bling&amp;#34; creates a better grip, plus it&#x27;s pretty and stylish</li>
    <li> I really love this bottle! It&#x27;s black and pink and it is easy to grip. The spray comes out as a perfect mist! It&#x27;s exactly what I need when I have to tame my loose ends! I am hoping I can even try this with hair spray. The lock on the bottle makes it easy to travel with. The lock is super easy to take on and off  which is great. I brought this out with me the other night and my friends were pretty jealous they didn&#x27;t think of bringing this spray bottle out with them. Great product!</li>
    <li> Okay. It’s a water bottle. But it’s a *pretty* water bottle. If you have to have something constantly in your line of vision why not go for something with a little pizzazz? I have a number of black and pink bottles nestled around my Chanel. Not all of them are expensive but on display together they look phenomenal. This little number fits right in. I’m always looking for the perfect container – something that combines function and beauty –for my bathroom countertop.  It cleans easily (although I probably wouldn’t put it in the dishwasher. I’m not sure how well the rhinestones would do). It does a great job with spritzing but not so much with misting (still repurposing an old perfume bottle for that).</li>
    <li> I liked this spray bottle right away. Nice matte texture finish with bling on the side. The mist on this bottle is very fine, ideal for kids who don&#x27;t like haircuts. The bottle also comes with a plastic &amp;#34;pin&amp;#34; that locks the sprayer while traveling. This product was provided to me no charge.</li>
    <li> I found the Hair Pink Diamond Ultra Mist Multi-Use Spray Bottle to do just as it states.  It offers a steady light spray mist with easy pressure placed on the trigger.  It would readily mist a hair style in process or a completed style.  It also comes with a locking trigger mechanism to prevent unintentional spraying.  I was impressed with the light, but full coverage mist it provided.  The bottle itself is attractively packaged with a side panel of sparkly &#x27;diamond&#x27; chips.  This would be an attractive accessory on any stylist shelf, as well as use on a private home&#x27;s toiletry shelf.</li>
    <li> I love this bottle! The design is quite unique. So far, I&#x27;ve only used it to hold a setting &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; but it sprays well providing full coverage to the tress your working on. I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend this product to professional stylists but anyone who uses spray bottles to dispense hair products at home should be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is truly a beautiful bottle...almost a work of art however, I don&#x27;t know that it could be easily sanitized because of the porous material its made of. It may be difficult to clean</li>
    <li> My Yorkie (dog) has a dry skin problem and this product delivers the external product on him with a perfect fine mist  of the product I use to give him relief. The bottle is comfortable in my hand and the sprayer is no fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can think of many uses for this product in hair care, skin care,and even home cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could do without the pink stripe : ).&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Received part of Salon Guys.  I do like the mist only options.  It did leak a little and the nozzle wouldn&#x27;t stay put.  I used it to iron with and it gave just enough water to help.  It is a good size to hold on to.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;ll start by saying that I love the shape of this bottle and also the texture. It has a shape that is very easy to grab onto, and also is made of a sort of felt like material so it feels very nice to the touch and is not slippery like some bottles can be, which is not good when you try to hold it with a bunch of liquid in the bottle. The spray pattern of the bottle was also very nice as well. It sprayed with a very wide spray so that all the liquid (I put hairspray in it) was not just going straight ahead, it was fanned out, which was nice so my hair didn&#x27;t get sticky. Last but not least, I do love the pattern on the bottle. Lots of spray bottles are boring and clear, this one is black and pink with rhinestones and is very girlie I love it! Even the most boring items like hairspray bottles should be personalized to be fun and girly and this certainly is!</li>
    <li> I love the style of the and look of the Ultra Mist Spray Bottle. It does not slip or drip water when the outside of the bottle gets wet. Also when your hands are I love the design of the crystals, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about them coming off. I have a habit of hanging the trigger of the bottle on my apron, or smock pocket. It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, and it is not bulky either. I would have to say, the spray mist bottle is not ideal for a client who has really thick hair. I say that because as it is a mist it takes a little longer to wet the hair before cutting it. However it is really good for a touch up if you have shampoo the clients before you cut the hair. It also works really great when giving a client a perm, and the end papers need to be wet. It gives the right amount of water to the end papers.</li>
    <li> This adorable misting bottle is not only chic and fun its also an amazing mist bottle. This misting spray bottles swivel head makes it easy to use at any angle. It also comes with a lock system so you don&#x27;t have t worry about this bottle misting anywhere without your finger on the trigger. It provides a perfect even mist that provides the section being misted on with even and complete coverage. It;&#x27;s the perfect misting spray bottle and not to mention its adorable design with crystals too!</li>
    <li> I love the color and feel of this bottle. It has a matte semi rubber finish that helps to grip the bottle while using it and the rhinestone accents are so decorative. It sprays well and the trigger is so easy to use. It matches all  My equipment at work well. My only complaint is that the rubber like finish does Mar easily. And it could hold more water for busy days at work.</li>
    <li> This water spray bottle has got my approval all the way! I was sent the black version by Salon Guys in order to review it and let me just say - I love it! It works really well, it mists efficiently and evenly. It also is coated with a non-slip grip which really makes it comfortable and easy to use. The only thing is that since it is not a plastic coating it can attract dust and make cleaning the surface a little trickier but since the coating makes it so enjoyable and comfortable to hold it is worth it. The best part of this water spray bottle has got to be the design - wow! it is so sleek and unique, I have never seen one like it before. All in all it is a great product not only would do I rate it five stars as a tool but also five stars as an accessory.</li>
    <li> I have been using the micromist for 3 days now.  The spray bottle head to my Aussie Sprunch Aerosol Hairspray broke and I decided to transfer the product into the ultramist spray bottle. So far, I am happy with the product. I prefer spray bottles with an ultrafine mist head because I can control how much product I want to spray and I feel the product is more evenly distributed on my hair then the standard spray mists. Other good features I appreciated about the product is the matte non-slip coating on the bottle and the lightweight feeling of the bottle. The matte coating not only serves a useful purpose (easier grip and handling of the product), but it also adds to the product’s aesthetic appeal. The coating and the jewels don’t look cheap, which I was concerned about because sometimes bottles with jewel detailing can look tacky. If you are looking for a nicer spray bottle, I think the price is reasonable for the quality of product.  There are definitely cheaper spray bottles at Walmart without the sleek design, but if you want a spray bottle with finer mist effect, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really liked this mister.  It is really stylish and it is great to mist my face during hot flashes.  It works well to mist your face and feet while tanning.</li>
    <li> I love this spray bottle.  I used it to wet sections of my very thick hair to restyle.  It goes on in a light mist so it allows you to control the amount of &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; you need.  Never had a bottle do that before and this is genius.  I used some of the left over water to mist my house plants too!  Get this, it will replace any other bottle you have used in the past.</li>
    <li> Upon first glance at arrival- The product that arrived was all black and did not have a pink accent strip.  The accent strip was black with the rhinestones on it had actually completely fallen off the product and was stuck on the packaging.  I peeled it off and was able to re-affix it onto the bottle with ease.  The texture of bottle is very similar to MAC’s tube foundation caps and shows dirt and makeup markings very easily.  I was not expecting much from this product after evaluating these points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I filled this with water and sprayed it on my hair I was pleasantly surprised because the spray is truly ultra-fine.  I am not getting completely soaked with each spray.  It targets the air I am spraying and lightly dampens the hair without saturating it, which is exactly what I was looking for.  I would give this 5 stars but I have deducted 1 star for the packaging issues.</li>
    <li> I received this product from SalonGuys as part of their market research program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This misting spray bottle seems to be well made. It is very compact, which is great for small working spaces or just keeping it out of the way when not in use. The head is smooth plastic, but the bottle body has a rubbery feel, which is great for keeping a good grip on it. The mist is VERY fine, and I absolutely love that it doesn&#x27;t make hair super wet with only a few sprays, or dribble extra water on my clients. The front of the bottle has a decorative panel with little rhinestones, which some people might find cute and I don&#x27;t personally care for. But it&#x27;s not that much of a detraction for me, because the functional use is good. $15 seems a bit much for a small bottle like this, but I do think it is a nice product and I will get a lot of use out of it.</li>
    <li> I found that the bottle does leak a little, but other than that the mist came out nicely. I also just really adore the way it looks. It adds a little pop of color to my bathroom. The design is simple, but adorable and classy.  I found it easy to hold and the texture of the bottle is nice. I will probably use it to mist my face in the summer as I work outside and when I’m at the beach. It does its purpose and I’m happy with the product I received.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of the spray bottle. And the pink and rhinestone design is really cute to. It is definitely has a nice mist spray. But it would he nice if you could change from the mist to a more powerful spray. But over all I do love the mist spray bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a regular household spray bottle on the mist setting for years to spray down my hair in the morning before styling.  When I received this Hair Tamer Ultra Mist Multi-Use Spray Bottle for review, I wasn&#x27;t sure I would even use it.  I was surprised to find that it is very useful when I need to just perk up my style after it has gone a bit flat.  If I just want to scrunch up my hair a bit, I will use this Ultra Mist Multi-Use Spray Bottle, then shake and scrunch my hair with my fingers.  To wet it down for styling with a blow dryer, I will continue to use my regular spray bottle.  This bottle has a soft textured coating with rhinestoney-looking sparkles set in one side of it.  It looks much nicer sitting on a bathroom cabinet than a regular generic one that could be used for household cleaning.  Since I have fine hair, I can recommend it for someone with fine hair - whether they have lot or a little of it.  I can&#x27;t see it working well for someone with thicker hair though.  It is very pretty, fits nicely in my hand, and truly does have an \\&quot;ultra-fine\\&quot; mist.</li>
    <li> I really love that this water bottle is matte black with the pink quilted accent in the front, its so classic! When I first got it i held it like a normal spray bottle but it fit very oddly in my hand but the picture on the box shows it being held differently and that way feels good. The mist that this product produces so super fine, I LOVE that! It also has a short range when you are spraying. I like this so that you aren&#x27;t spraying a fine mist over everything that is around, it is just focused on what is right in front of the bottle.</li>
    <li> This bottle is light weight and super awesome. The bottle i received through the market research program is slim which makes it great to hold. Its not bulky or heavy even when full. I got the all black bottle with the little designs on the side. I&#x27;m really enjoying the texture of this bottle as well. Its sort of rubbery so its good for grip. the nozzle works just fine and the spray is a wide spray but whatever you&#x27;re trying to get wet it works. It gives a nice mist. The other spray bottles I have experienced are not shaped as well as this one its like they made it just for me!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it. It works like advertised</li>
    <li> I am providing this review as a participant of the Salon Guys Market Research program.  This product was received on time and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The look and feel of the bottle is fantastic, it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to hold and spray.  My daughter loved the color and the sparkles! The nozzle does not clog, which is a bonus, nor does it drip or expel large droplets of water.  The fine mist of spray is the perfect amount needed to add style to messy tresses without leaving you feel like your hair is soaking wet. The fine mist is also great for her baby fine hairs that tend to stick up straight.  We highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this bottle it works great and it is so pretty.  I have the black bottle with diamonds.  It is very comfortable to hold with a nice soft grip and easy to use.  I have very fine thin hair and it works great when I want to touch up my hair in the morning. It doesn’t soak my hair and doesn’t drip like other bottles I have used. It has a nice fine mist perfect for reactivating the hair products I have on or just blowing my hair out.  I think it would be great to mist the plants in the house as well.  Multi purpose indeed.</li>
    <li> This sprayer was exactly as described. The bedazzlements are very pretty and the bottle has a nice smooth satin finish, so it is very easy to hold on to. This product is of very nice quality as well, the sprayer does not clog like many other cheap bottles do. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a high functioning spray bottle that is very fashionable and aesthetically please in your bathroom or salon. The price is a good deal too for a nicer product. Shipping was also very fast, which I greatly appreciated. This product is currently sitting out on my counter since it looks so nice.</li>
    <li> The fine mist is the real selling point. I have other spray bottles (from a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; beauty supply store) but they don&#x27;t seem to work any better than cleaning spray bottles I could get for a buck at the grocery store. This one really has a different spray to it. Great for re-wetting your hair or applying heat protectant. It&#x27;s better than some of the bottles my products come in, so I might buy a few more and transfer my sprays to them. Wish there were more colors.</li>
    <li> This works great because the mist is very fine. You don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re soaking your client Everytime u spritz. The pink is not obnoxious. Pretty cute</li>
    <li> I love this hair tamer mist bottle! First of all I like the pink color and love how it feels in my hand. I used to use different sized plastic bottles and end up with cramps in my hand. This bottle fits perfectly and my hand has not cramped. The bottle is made of a felt type of material (as best as I could describe it) that makes it nonslippery and the fine mist is perfect for using on hair and I think even spraying water on clothes for ironing. The lock mechanism works good and I like that feature. The price is great. Delivery was fast. I will order more of these hair tamer mist bottles.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily think about buying a spray bottle that was adorable, but this one certainly was and now I&#x27;m really glad I have it.  I honestly didn&#x27;t know what I was missing with my less expensive spray bottles.  It is a really nice size and weight once water is in it.  It has just enough sparkle to make it classy but also super cute.  As far as actual functionality, this is a really nice spray bottle.  It creates a fine mist which is just enough to wet my hair without soaking it.  this is really nice for an end of the day pick me up where I just need to tame a little spot of hair. I highly recommend this if you want something super functional, but also super cute.</li>
    <li> The micro mist spray bottle is really nice.  I have the black bottle with rhinestones embedded down the front with a black background.  It holds about 8 ounces of liquid and it’s really comfortable to hold in your hands.  I use it mainly when doing my hair, so my hands may be damp or wet and the rubberized texture on the bottle is really good at preventing slip. The box says it has an easy lock system, but I haven’t been able to figure out how to lock the bottle and there don’t seem to be any instructions or diagrams to show the locking motion. All in all I would recommend this bottle.</li>
    <li> This is a very good quality spray bottle! The grip is comfortable and easy to hold. But still looks glamorous out on the vanity! The matte black bottle gives it a smooth modern look, and the jewels on it add a nice flare of pizzazz to your work station or home. The mist is so wonderful, it is a very even mist that will leave you with the perfect style! I intend to transfer some of my other hair sprays in to bottles like this one for this very reason! This is a very good tool and is an essential to any hair stylist- or anyone styling their hair!</li>
    <li> First off, this bottle is super cute and a little blingy but not too much.  The rhinestones definitely won&#x27;t fall out and the bottle is non-slip and fits very comfortably in my hand.  The mist covers a large section of my hair although it&#x27;s not an abundance of water...it&#x27;s truly a fine mist.  There are no leaks, so far which can be a very annoying thing when you just want to spritz your hair and water runs down your arm from a faulty sprayer.  The only issue I might have with this is if I had paid $14.99.  I think that&#x27;s a bit steep even for this bottle. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a better than many I&#x27;ve purchased at a lesser price.</li>
    <li> This is the most adorable spray bottle I have ever had. The price is a little much but worth it. Hopefully I won&#x27;t need another spray bottle ever again. I got the all black one and love the crystals on it. It works well. Its nice and soft and smooth like Kate said. It is hard to explain unless you actually feel it for yourself. I have to fight myself not to use it when it&#x27;s not needed. I use it on my hair as well as for my plants. The spray is perfect for both. Should your hair get a little too dry prior to blow drying just use a squirt or two from this bottle. It won&#x27;t drench your hair and will only give it enough to start styling it with the hairdryer.</li>
    <li> First of all, this spray bottle is aesthetically really nice with the pretty pink quilted look and and the rhinestones. The bottle material is so smooth and soft it almost feels like extremely fine velvet or felt. I love that it has a removable lock on it, making it great for longer term storage of a liquid, though I do feel like I might end up losing the lock if I leave it off for a long time. The spray head moves around freely but can also be tightened which is a nice, versatile feature. The mist it sprays is so fine and so gentle I didn’t even know a spray bottle could be so nice. Is it worth the amazon price? Probably not, but I think this is a really nice product and if you’re looking for a nice spray bottle and you are willing to splurge a little, this would be a great choice. I received this product free of charge as a part of the Salon Guys Market Research program in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
    <li> This spray bottle was provided to me buy the Salon guys because I am in their market research program. I like it so much!  It is pretty, fits nicely in my hand, has a soft feel to it and sprays awesome!!!  The mist is so fine and wonderful.  I love how it sprays out in such a wide fine mist pattern.  It does not saturate my hair in any place, it spreads the product you put in it very well.  I recommend this spray bottle for looks and for use.  I like it a lot!</li>
    <li> A dressier version of a commonplace item. The rhinestones and quilted pink pattern on the front (side? back? whatever you choose) are cute without being overwhelming (the rhinestones are actually kind of small). The grip is very smooth and almost has a soft quality to it. As far as actually dispensing water, the stream produced by the sprayer is very fine, to the point where you would need to spray your hand 4-5 times for it to feel wet. The trigger has good resistance to it. The bottle doesn’t leak everywhere if you tip it upside down. The base is wider than the rest of the bottle for balance.</li>
    <li> A mist spray. Works fine.</li>
    <li> When I opened this, I was a little disappointed in the quality. It&#x27;ll get it&#x27;s purpose done as a spray bottle but who knows how long it will last.</li>
</ol>
