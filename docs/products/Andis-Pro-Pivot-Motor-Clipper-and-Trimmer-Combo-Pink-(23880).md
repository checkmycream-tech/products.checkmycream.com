      <li>These clippers are for a woman because it is not hard on the skin at all.</li>
      <li>New, graduated, cosmetology student that needed a backup pair of clippers and trimmers.</li>
      <li>I always have to go back and double check my haircut for long pieces and on topof that they feel very cheap.</li>
      <li>I am a professional cosmetologist and I was looking for a pair of clippers because my whals were burnt out.</li>

<li> But the small trimmer wasn&#x27;t as accurate as my regular mustache trimmer.</li>
<li> and the cord is long enough to get all around my clients</li>
<li> The trimmers sound horrible and the clippers do not sound good either.</li>
<li> The pink is not as vivid as the photo depicts; very dull/matte in appearance and the clippers were a different dismal depressing shade of pink than the trimmers.</li>
<li> Would have given no stars, but 1-star was due to the clippers at least turning on (though at a very slow pace and with the sound that they were on their last life-line).</li>
<li> Second pair I&#x27;ve been through within less then a month.</li>
<li> They&#x27;re slow, they barely cut the hair and they pull the clients hair.</li>
<li> Not worth buying not worth spending your money on.</li>
<li> performance of this is dismal as I have to shave after every two days  but previously did it weekly.</li>
<li> I oiled them and cleaned them properly and within the third use my former educator told me they sounded bad.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t do hair everyday as I am a stay at home mom.</li>
<li> and I bought these on here for way less!</li>
<li> The lever is hard to move up and down and the guards sometimes have trouble going on.</li>
<li> They pull hair and make small kids cry.</li>
<li> Work slow</li>
<li> Not good quality at all.</li>
<li> They also are bad for fading as the blades are dull and wont cut correctly.</li>
<li> These were a fail.</li>
<li> Hate them, they came with dull blades.  </li>
<li> I asked if they screws needed tightened or anything, even though they hadn&#x27;t been dropped, and he said no that they both were just a really bad pair.</li>
<li> These clippers are the worst clippers I have ever had in my life.</li>
<li> These are CRAP!!!</li>
<li> These are horrible.</li>

    <li> If I could I would give no stars. These are horrible. When I got mine the blades were not lined up right and the blades on the clippers and trimmers were bent!!! But I thought well I will try them anyway. And I did and I couldnt use them. Since July I have tried to get a refund from this seller. They have no worked with me saying they cant do refunds when in fact yes they can. They told me to contact the manufacturer. I did and they cant do nothing for me because I didnt have a warranty paper in with the clippers!!! So I have contacted this seller since then and I am still trying to get them to work with me but they wont!!! These are CRAP!!! Not worth buying not worth spending your money on. I promise you wont be happy. I should of listened to others reviews on these from this seller but I thought I would go ahead and try them anyway. I regret it. When I got them I went to cut a guys hair and when I started they clippers pulled and got stuck. I was so pissed off. That has never happened to me before and I have owned cheaper clippers and trimmers than these and they worked amazingly! I dont recommend this set nor from this seller. They are a bunch of greedy jerks.</li>
    <li> I saw these in the store for 60 dollars. and I bought these on here for way less! these are so great. they are also very stylish.</li>
    <li> New, graduated, cosmetology student that needed a backup pair of clippers and trimmers. I oiled them and cleaned them properly and within the third use my former educator told me they sounded bad. I asked if they screws needed tightened or anything, even though they hadn&#x27;t been dropped, and he said no that they both were just a really bad pair. The trimmers sound horrible and the clippers do not sound good either.</li>
    <li> I work full time as a stylist and these are in use every day.  The clippers work very well.  The trimmers, not so much.  They don&#x27;t take off all the hair when edging.  I like that they have the T-shaped blade, though and I love that they are pink.  I&#x27;m satisfied with the price I paid. I would buy the clippers again, but not the set,  unless the price was worth it without using the trimmers.</li>
    <li> They pull hair and make small kids cry. Hate them, they came with dull blades.  They also are bad for fading as the blades are dull and wont cut correctly.</li>
    <li> Out with the old and in with the new!!! I love this combo!! I don&#x27;t do hair everyday as I am a stay at home mom. I have my cosmetology license, but don&#x27;t practice it, only with my husband, boys, and occasionally my friends. It is not used everyday, but as I can see the quality of these clippers are top dog!!! Very easy to use and love the pink color!!</li>
    <li> I am a professional cosmetologist and I was looking for a pair of clippers because my whals were burnt out. I loved these because they are pink but I honestly don&#x27;t think they were made for professional use. I only purchased these because I saw a review from another licensed cosmetologist saying they worked great for her. They were awseom at first but they don&#x27;t cut all of the hair. I always have to go back and double check my haircut for long pieces and on topof that they feel very cheap. The trimmers ddon&#x27;t cut a straight line. These clippers may be good for home use when they are only used every few months but not for every day use. The one thing I really did like was the guard attachment&#x27;s for the trimmers. It makes beard trims soo much easier.</li>
    <li> The lever is hard to move up and down and the guards sometimes have trouble going on. The trimmers shake more than peanuts I&#x27;m use to using.</li>
    <li> Bought these to use on my dogs and they lastest for about 1 month.  Used then to clean the hair from their feet occassionally.</li>
    <li> Overall this product work well,....the liner clippers need an adjustment to the blades in order to work properly. Otherwise, I love them.</li>
    <li> The trimmers are off track and something broke in the clippers. Not good quality at all. Second pair I&#x27;ve been through within less then a month.</li>
    <li> The Clippers and Trimmer are the best I&#x27;ve had in a few years.  I love the color.  Thank you for a quality product</li>
    <li> From ComputerChic: Despite all negative reviews, I wanted to give them a fair try. Would have given no stars, but 1-star was due to the clippers at least turning on (though at a very slow pace and with the sound that they were on their last life-line). After trying EVERY plug in the home, the trimmers did not / would not turn on. The pink is not as vivid as the photo depicts; very dull/matte in appearance and the clippers were a different dismal depressing shade of pink than the trimmers. Andis is usually a great brand for us. These were a fail.</li>
    <li> love my new clipper set. love the color, have to work a little harder to make sure no hairs are left long but still love it</li>
    <li> It does its job. But the small trimmer wasn&#x27;t as accurate as my regular mustache trimmer. Ended using that instead for edge ups.</li>
    <li> Work for short period of time great color.</li>
    <li> The Andis clipper and trimmer performe superbly, they have more power than my old clippers, they are much quieter and do not cause my hands to betired after a ong day of clipping hair.  I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Love my breast cancer awareness clippers!!</li>
    <li> The lever on the clippers gets stuck and the clippers get hot fast. Edgers could be more precise.</li>
    <li> Ok, edges don&#x27;t.work as good as I thought. Work slow</li>
    <li> These clippers are the worst clippers I have ever had in my life. They&#x27;re slow, they barely cut the hair and they pull the clients hair. I would not recommend them at all. My first pair of Andi&#x27;s clippers did not give me a good first impression. Definitely going back to Wahl clippers.</li>
    <li> Thanks for sending the machines as you had projected.&lt;br /&gt;They are however not meeting my expectations. T he clipper is not shaving clean as I thought. I had the silver brand which gave me quite good results. When I needed to replace the aging machine  I could not trace it anywhere and this prompted me to source it with you. I was even duped by another merchant who sent me what I had not ordered .The performance of this is dismal as I have to shave after every two days  but previously did it weekly.</li>
    <li> Great product love Ly new clippers they work great and the cord is long enough to get all around my clients and they are super quiet which is nice too</li>
    <li> These clippers are for a woman because it is not hard on the skin at all. The clippers arrived fast and package well. I really like these clippers.</li>
    <li> I worked for a two weeks and after that stopped working, I did not have time to send it back</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t cut good at all waste of money</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product it was affordable and shipped in a timely manner and it gives a nice close shave love the extended blade on the trimmers great for lining up men&#x27;s facial hair</li>
