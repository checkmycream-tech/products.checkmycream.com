      <li>While Love Fury smells great while just sniffing the bottle, just wait until you put it on!</li>

      <li>the smell smells fresh and pleasant.</li>
      <li>It lasts a lot and it&#x27;s a lovely fragrance.</li>
      <li>Love this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>the top of the bottle is supposed to represent Nine Wests heels.</li>
      <li>I received Love Fury on time and well packaged.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a lovely scent, a woody spice type of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Although</li>
      <li>I love the bottle to this</li>
      <li>I really love this perfume got it in the mail</li>
      <li>The bottle is OK, the fragrance is OK while it lasts (which is, like, 2 hours after aplication).</li>
      <li>Love the smell ....</li>
      <li>Staying power is okay.</li>
      <li>Love it and the price</li>
      <li>it smelled so much better.</li>
      <li>I love the bottle design, too.</li>
      <li>All I have to say is that I love this.</li>
      <li>The perfume (My long time favorite) is 100% authentic, and perfect!</li>
      <li>This is a nice sized perfume with a clean scent.</li>
      <li>When I first bought Love Fury, I liked the scent.</li>
      <li>It turns out that Love Fury smells really good, but is so strong that it&#x27;s still there the next day if it has been sprayed on liberally!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Yes,they love it very much.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought the purse size roll-on from the store...</li>
      <li>Light and sweet fragrance without the nose burning alcohol undertones.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to start off by saying that I think this particular perfume is better to be warn in colder weather, my body chemistry somehow let&#x27;s off a pungent spicy smell during the summer time.</li>
      <li>idk why but its a great quality but for a  summer or everyday--</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
      <li>smells great, sweet with a light flower scent, but i got tired of it...</li>
      <li>Just to tell you guys first hand, make sure you put the top back on right because one wrong move the bottle will slip if you have the top on correctly you can pick it up by the top.</li>
      <li>Shipped fast!</li>
      <li>It had such a lighter smell and as if it smelled more pretty to me.</li>
      <li>This is my fourth order of Love Fury.  </li>
      <li>--- It is a very nice if a little soft fragrance.</li>
      <li>This bottle was new, and exactly right.</li>
      <li>It came with two little perfume samples which is really nice.</li>
      <li>came fast and is pretty big for the right price.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Dont get me wrong, I thought it smelled great.</li>
      <li>It is not very strong but smells great and long lasting</li>
      <li>This is October now and it&#x27;s starting to get colder by the day and when I first purchased this</li>
      <li>This is a light, clean, slightly floral  (very slight), very feminine fragrance.</li>
      <li>This lasts pretty long on me</li>
      <li>too lol...is soft</li>
      <li>I suggested she try Love Fury based on a brief sniff of a small sample at a mall, so she bought some.  </li>
      <li>Too soft, barely noticeable.</li>
      <li>wife recently changed to using just a tiny bit instaed of applying too much via spray.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful scent, but useless :-/</li>
      <li>I literally drench myself in this, and 30 minutes later I can barely smell it anywhere on me.  </li>

<li> Seriously!!</li>

    <li> Love the smell .... Have trouble with the pump ... Does not spray well.</li>
    <li> My wife has used OPIUM for years and I&#x27;ve always loved it.  I suggested she try Love Fury based on a brief sniff of a small sample at a mall, so she bought some.  It turns out that Love Fury smells really good, but is so strong that it&#x27;s still there the next day if it has been sprayed on liberally!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife recently changed to using just a tiny bit instaed of applying too much via spray.  What she does is spray a small amount on a finger-tip and apply behind ears, etc. with her finger, and that works well.  Now I love it!</li>
    <li> I have never come across a perfume with so little staying power...NEVER.  I literally drench myself in this, and 30 minutes later I can barely smell it anywhere on me.  Even when I hold the dispenser to my nose a few minutes after spraying I can barely smell anything.  Very strange.  Beautiful scent, but useless :-/</li>
    <li> the best ever came on time and smells good</li>
    <li> The bottle is OK, the fragrance is OK while it lasts (which is, like, 2 hours after aplication). Too soft, barely noticeable.</li>
    <li> I purchased this perviously at the ninewest store and needed a replacement. This is a nice sized perfume with a clean scent.</li>
    <li> All I have to say is that I love this. Perfume... It lasts a lot and it&#x27;s a lovely fragrance. It came with two little perfume samples which is really nice. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received Love Fury on time and well packaged.  It was as described and it&#x27;s a lovely scent, a woody spice type of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Although I like it, the cap is broken.  But it was a great value and I&#x27;ll be back to purchase from this seller again!</li>
    <li> Came across the Nine West Fury at the mall one day and have to say the smell caught my attention. It went on my list for her Christmas gifts... She was very impressed with the smell and told me I have very good taste. :)</li>
    <li> Second time i buy it for a present be cause its a great Edt</li>
    <li> Smells really good! Love it and the price too lol...is soft you can wear for any occasion!  People always ask me the name</li>
    <li> Shipped fast! Love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> smells great, sweet with a light flower scent, but i got tired of it...idk why but its a great quality but for a  summer or everyday-- i would mix this scent wit a body spray</li>
    <li> I always get compliments when I wear this perfume. I can&#x27;t wait to buy the lotion. I love the bottle design, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to start off by saying that I think this particular perfume is better to be warn in colder weather, my body chemistry somehow let&#x27;s off a pungent spicy smell during the summer time. This is October now and it&#x27;s starting to get colder by the day and when I first purchased this I didn&#x27;t like it all because it was too spicy for me. The other day I smelled it after I sprayed my wrists and I went outside and I smelled my wrist and long behold it smelled so much better. It had such a lighter smell and as if it smelled more pretty to me. I love the bottle to this the top of the bottle is supposed to represent Nine Wests heels. Just to tell you guys first hand, make sure you put the top back on right because one wrong move the bottle will slip if you have the top on correctly you can pick it up by the top. This lasts pretty long on me I&#x27;d say around 6 hours. I think this will be my go to scent for the fall/winter time only because you don&#x27;t seem to find a lot of perfumes that are acceptable for the colder times of year.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance.  It is not very strong but smells great and long lasting</li>
    <li> I originally bought the purse size roll-on from the store... I love it!  it doesn&#x27;t last as long as i&#x27;d like (maybe 3-5 hrs) but it does the job.</li>
    <li> Es una fragancia muy agradable, aunque un poco suave. El precio es excelente y la recomiendo a cualquiera que quiera quedar bien con esa persona especial. --- It is a very nice if a little soft fragrance. The price is excellent and I recommend it to anyone who wants to look good with that special person.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth order of Love Fury.  Light and sweet fragrance without the nose burning alcohol undertones.</li>
    <li> Tried this at the Ninewest boutique,was so excited but quickly disappointed. Smells like a generic heady perfume out there. Too floral fruity, that it gave me a headache sniffing my wrist for amber notes but too faint. Staying power is okay.</li>
    <li> When I first bought Love Fury, I liked the scent. Dont get me wrong, I thought it smelled great. It just didn&#x27;t give me that &amp;#34;wow!&amp;#34; moment....until I put it on. Oh man! It smells amazing!!! I have to say that I am in love! While Love Fury smells great while just sniffing the bottle, just wait until you put it on! Seriously!!</li>
    <li> Good prize, good stuff.  I gave all my friends on their birthdays Fury Eau  De Parfum.  They love it !  Yes,they love it very much.  Keep in your mind, Fury very popular in Europe . Buy from this company,best prize.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping! The perfume (My long time favorite) is 100% authentic, and perfect! Other sites sell perfumes that are old, and a bit stale. This bottle was new, and exactly right. This is a light, clean, slightly floral  (very slight), very feminine fragrance.</li>
    <li> I really love this perfume got it in the mail quickly less then 4 days 😬 I recommended</li>
    <li> ladies this is a must buy! the smell smells fresh and pleasant. if you havent tried it please do you wont regret it. came fast and is pretty big for the right price. i will definitely buy this again. this is my new favorite perfume!!! thank you!!!!</li>
