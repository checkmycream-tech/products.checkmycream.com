      <li>I already really like Vera Wang&#x27;s original Princess scent, but I LOVE this!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this scent is discontinued</li>
      <li>The perfume came early &amp; my granddaughter was thrilled.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent of this perfume SO much.  </li>
      <li>scent is musky, not as sweet as the stuff i&#x27;ve been into recently, but its very sophisticated</li>
      <li>Beautiful scent after it was on for a little while.</li>
      <li>perfume is exactly as I remember it and smells divine!</li>
      <li>anyways I risked adding it to my wish list and when I finally tried it on, I fell in love!</li>
      <li>I love the unique way it smells and it lasts on me all day long.  </li>
      <li>I got the 3 oz size (it&#x27;s a little more than 3 oz), and it&#x27;s huge!</li>
      <li>(and its a big bottle, so i feel okay about doing that)&lt;br</li>
      <li>When this perfume first came out, I bought it at sephora.</li>
      <li>And was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>this perfume has a sharp pizzaz.when you put it on you are ready to smell good and be ready for a night out on the town</li>
      <li>I personally prefer the Vera Wang Princess (normal), and this smell doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the original, but it is nice, and it works for when I don&#x27;t have the original.</li>
      <li>Very feminine.</li>
      <li>If you can get your hands on a bottle, I highly recommend!</li>

      <li>Soft; not a overpowering smell!!!</li>
      <li>The smell is amazing but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long once you put it on</li>

      <li>I think it could be do to where you live.</li>
      <li>Its light &amp; long lasting.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting it for a long time and finally caved after not being able to find it anywhere else because I&#x27;m thinking this could have been one of my last opportunities!</li>
      <li>or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this on a Friday and it came the following Monday - super speedy shipping, especially for Hawaii!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s</li>
      <li>A young friend was wearing it</li>
      <li>I also prefer some stuff that&#x27;s coming directly from Amazon</li>
      <li>I recommend it to any guy who wants to buy for a female</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s dark and edgy but sophisticated and sultry!</li>
      <li>Apparently this is a discontinued product</li>
      <li>its my style to dress in black (just giving some info to get the sense of who it can appeal to) and this appeals to me very much.</li>
      <li>I live in a dry area so perfume and cologne smells usually last a long time on people here.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love the scent of this perfume SO much.  However, and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me, but the scent does not stick around for very long.  A mere minutes after  I put it on I don&#x27;t smell it anymore.  No one else smells it either. I&#x27;ve only gotten one compliment on it because it just doesn&#x27;t stick around.  Pricey for a scent that doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Bought the perfume for my wife and she loves it. I recommend it to any guy who wants to buy for a female</li>
    <li> Love the smell of Rock Princess, company pricing was very good. But was charge for over night instead of standard shipping. Took a while to get them to respond back after 4 or 5 e-mail. They did credit the shipping and handling.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best perfume I own yet! (the many samples I have included). It smells wonderful and sexy, I would wear it everyday if I didn&#x27;t own any others.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume!!! A young friend was wearing it and I fell in love with it.  Apparently this is a discontinued product and I was so happy to have found it on Amazon at a decent price.  Rock Star is a very nice light sweet smell.  Most perfumes make me sneeze but this one does not.  And the compliments put a smile on me :-)  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite fragrance since it came out! Very disappointed when I learned it was discontinued about a year after being released, so I was excited to find there was still some available! Price was awesome. Arrived on time and in perfect shape!</li>
    <li> I got this by chance. I had a friend who had it but in the area I live, it&#x27;s very hard to find. I found it one day in a store and snatched it.  I love how the smell is not like anything else you can find.  People I&#x27;m around love how it smells too.     I actually don&#x27;t have a problem with it fading.  I think it could be do to where you live. I live in a dry area so perfume and cologne smells usually last a long time on people here.  We also don&#x27;t sweat very much due to the same thing.      My scent lasts all day and I hear guys saying they want to but it for their girlfriends but don&#x27;t know where to get it because it&#x27;s always out of stock.    I am going to keep buying it until they don&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent! My girlfriend was devastated when they discontinued this line in stores but I&#x27;m more than happy to surprise her with this on her birthday. Definitely a gorgeous scent, its absolutely irresistible.</li>
    <li> smells great.. got it for my gf for Vday.. she loved it :) happy all around ;)</li>
    <li> I remember smelling this in a magazine add and falling in love! (granted this was a few years ago.) I never forgot the name, and when i saw it on Amazon for this price I had to give it a try, I mean.. I loved it then, why wouldn&#x27;t I love it now? So i bought it and its a great scent!&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a good ammount of time if you spray like 3-4 times. (and its a big bottle, so i feel okay about doing that)&lt;br /&gt;the scent is musky, not as sweet as the stuff i&#x27;ve been into recently, but its very sophisticated and i&#x27;ve been wearing it everyday since I got it! (: a good change for the new season.</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite perfume.  I love the unique way it smells and it lasts on me all day long.  My roommate says this smells like candy on me, but she doesn&#x27;t think it smells as good on her.  Everyone is different, but I will stock up on this so I never run out.  Hope they never discontinue it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this scent is discontinued so I&#x27;m glad I could grab it online still! I&#x27;ve been wanting it for a long time and finally caved after not being able to find it anywhere else because I&#x27;m thinking this could have been one of my last opportunities! I love the smell of this perfume. It&#x27;s a distinct scent without being too overwhelming or unnatural and I love the musky undertones of it. I already really like Vera Wang&#x27;s original Princess scent, but I LOVE this! Sadly I&#x27;ll probably be switching to just the regular \\&quot;Princess\\&quot; scent if this gets too difficult to find online. Stock up while you can!</li>
    <li> This was one of my favorite buys. It came in the mail on time and the perfume is exactly what I wanted for a really great price. They even threw in two free goodies with my purchase. It was another sample of a perfume and a multipurpose nail filer. IT was cute. I not only recommend the product but the seller.  OH! and a coupon on my next purchase from them.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume! I got my first bottle form ulta and fell in love with it! It&#x27;s dark and edgy but sophisticated and sultry!</li>
    <li> The bottle is good quality and contains a good amount of perfume in it. The smell is amazing but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long once you put it on</li>
    <li> I love this scent ! Its light &amp; long lasting.</li>
    <li> My bottle of Rock Princess was getting close to empty and everywhere I looked, NO ONE had it in stock anymore!  I lost hope.  I thought they just quit producing it.  It was a great surprise when I found it on Amazon!  I have been using it religiously!  It is my all time favorite perfume.  I do wish the scent lasted longer though...</li>
    <li> Soft; not a overpowering smell!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this without knowing what it smelled like, and it smells nice. I personally prefer the Vera Wang Princess (normal), and this smell doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the original, but it is nice, and it works for when I don&#x27;t have the original.</li>
    <li> When this perfume first came out, I bought it at sephora. Cut to a hundred years later, and it&#x27;s disappeared off the face of the earth...or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this on a Friday and it came the following Monday - super speedy shipping, especially for Hawaii! I also prefer some stuff that&#x27;s coming directly from Amazon and it&#x27;s not here yet (I have prime), so I&#x27;m very pleased with this business!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfume is exactly as I remember it and smells divine! I got the 3 oz size (it&#x27;s a little more than 3 oz), and it&#x27;s huge! Hopefully the perfume doesn&#x27;t spoil by the time I&#x27;m done with it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful perfume and would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent after it was on for a little while. Very feminine.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Vera Wang Princess, and Princess Rock is even better! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> Great price. And was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I do not like this perfume. I suggest not buying! I would love my money back if that were possible</li>
    <li> Cheap bottle&lt;br /&gt;Glitter everywhere&lt;br /&gt;No compliments&lt;br /&gt;Perfume lasts about an hour</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfumes!</li>
    <li> This is a great scent for daytime, as it is fresh and sweet - but not sickly. It&#x27;s always something people comment on. The name says it all...</li>
    <li> this perfume has a sharp pizzaz.when you put it on you are ready to smell good and be ready for a night out on the town</li>
    <li> I have been waiting to get this perfume for a few years. I love it and ordered two bottles. I spray a little on my skin, but mainly spray it on my clothes and that seems to help the smell stick around longer, cause just it really doesnt stick around if you just spray it on your skin.</li>
    <li> I chose it for something different. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all. Order Glam Princesses and you&#x27;ll be set!!! It&#x27;s scent lingers and a ton of people give you comments on it...</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite perfume. It is so hard to find these days since it was limited edition. Every time I wear it someone compliment the scent. If you can get your hands on a bottle, I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love it...just wondering why they discontinued it!</li>
    <li> This particular bottle was very weak.  As if it had been watered down.  The scent did not last long when I wore it.  Makes me wonder if it was fake.</li>
    <li> First of all lets start with how awesome this scent is. I received it as a gift because I added it to my wish list, but I havent even tried scent testing it..I just know that my favorite scents came together in this bottle. Raspberry, peach, coconut, bergamot, and lily...anyways I risked adding it to my wish list and when I finally tried it on, I fell in love! I&#x27;ve used Hypnotic Poison ala Christian Dior...for years and when this came I set that one aside. I have used others when I wanted a change..but this one took me by surprise. I like the bottle and it lasts on me. It helps if you put lotion on and spray yourself over..thats how it lasts longer on me. Every body is different. I am going to buy it again. I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and I like Gothic, industrial, new wave and hard rock music, its my style to dress in black (just giving some info to get the sense of who it can appeal to) and this appeals to me very much. I&#x27;m usually into patchouli, woodsy, and vanilla scents, but this fits me pretty well.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great deal</li>
    <li> The perfume came early &amp; my granddaughter was thrilled.  She was especially excited because she thought it had been discontinued.</li>
    <li> I remember it was in stores some odd years ago and I loved the bottle alone and couldn&#x27;t remember the scent, I got this for a great price and I love it! One of my favorite perfumes :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this last year and am getting to the point where I will have to re-order.  Love the smell of this perfume.  Will have to try some of her other products.  Will be ordering soon.</li>
