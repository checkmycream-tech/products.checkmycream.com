      <li>My favorite Self-tanning foam, by far.</li>
      <li>This dries/absorbs very fast and can get dressed right away.  </li>

      <li>I watched the demonstration video 4 times and followed the instructions exactly.  </li>
      <li>: The dryer areas of skin such as my knees and ankles end up having much more spotting and streaking in comparison to the lotion.</li>

      <li>very tan, golden brown hands  </li>
      <li>Did I say my hands were a pretty brown?</li>

      <li>I. Like this foaming formula because it dries fast.</li>
      <li>Goes on really well.</li>
      <li>and it turns to wet quickly, but this makes it easier to spread quickly.  </li>
      <li>Jergens is my favorite brand of self-tanner due to color, smell, &amp; price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a ton of self tanning products and I highly recommend this one or the cream version which I prefer over the foam.</li>
      <li>This is a great product and I can&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s so difficult to find it on the shelves.  </li>
      <li>Normal skin color.</li>
      <li>no exfoliating, faint nice smell, easy to use, doesn&#x27;t stain clothes or towels, sheets, bathroom floor, after 2 applications I had color, after 6 applications I have a gorgeous, natural, deep, dark, even brown tan, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to sunless tanners.</li>
      <li>It goes on clear</li>
      <li>So far hands look like the rest of my body and palms are not stained.</li>
      <li>I have always used the Jergens Natural Glow Lotion</li>
      <li>Same problems as with St. Tropez, didn&#x27;t work but got very tan hands.  </li>
      <li>: as the day progressed I noticed a faint odor (I am used to the smell it smells like all sunless tanners but much lighter than most) went away after shower.</li>
      <li>absorbs quickly, still has a tanning cream smell to it, after a few hours.</li>
      <li>All the time I&#x27;m going through the hassle of trying the above, sitting around for 8 hours in old clothes, exfoliating, showering with no luck my roommate kept saying &amp;#34;try Jergens&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>( this is not going to make you look like you just came back from a week at the beach) very subtle natural healthy glow.</li>

    <li> Good color with this foam, but kind of sticky.  absorbs quickly, still has a tanning cream smell to it, after a few hours.</li>
    <li> I have tried all of the drugstore tanners for 5 years now and this is the hands down winner.</li>
    <li> I. Like this foaming formula because it dries fast. No waiting to put clothes on, and it&#x27;s easy to put on.  It&#x27;s both a moisturizer and self-tanning.</li>
    <li> Works great! Washes off easily. Saw a bunch of reviews on YouTube since this is my first self tanner. Will buy again 😁</li>
    <li> Received item on time and as described.</li>
    <li> Works great looks natural!</li>
    <li> really good dries fast</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s weird. it comes out runny and then turns to foam. slap your hands together and it turns to wet quickly, but this makes it easier to spread quickly.  as you rub it in, it dries very quickly which is great.  I like it better than the cream because the cream stays &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; for some time.  This dries/absorbs very fast and can get dressed right away.  I use it on my face, neck and shoulders for an instant &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; tan.  later, i&#x27;ll use it for shorts weather!  Buy it.</li>
    <li> My favorite Self-tanning foam, by far.</li>
    <li> I am quite pale as I just had a child and haven&#x27;t had time or felt like sun bathing in 9 months that being said I took the advice of other reviewers and ordered this in the darker shade of medium to tan. A little goes a long way it foams up big.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Plesant odor, not streaky, looks natural sun kissed ( this is not going to make you look like you just came back from a week at the beach) very subtle natural healthy glow. Only faded a little after the gym sauna and shower. Does not stain&lt;br /&gt;Cons: as the day progressed I noticed a faint odor (I am used to the smell it smells like all sunless tanners but much lighter than most) went away after shower. It goes on clear so you can&#x27;t see where it is applied it is also mildly sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 5stars because it exceeded my expectations for a sunless tanner and the cons were very minimal</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to sunless tanners. I read reviews and found St. Tropez to be #1 recommended with 5 star reviews. Tried it many times, tried the mouse, oil, regular, and the express. I watched the demonstration video 4 times and followed the instructions exactly.  Pros: very tan, golden brown hands  Cons: messy, stains bathroom and clothing, towels, sheets, doesn&#x27;t work no matter how many times I tried it, smells, mitts fall apart after 1 use, makes skin very dry, expensive. Did I say my hands were a pretty brown? :  Next I tried Clinique tanning lotion. Followed instructions exactly. Same problems as with St. Tropez, didn&#x27;t work but got very tan hands.  All the time I&#x27;m going through the hassle of trying the above, sitting around for 8 hours in old clothes, exfoliating, showering with no luck my roommate kept saying &amp;#34;try Jergens&amp;#34;. I was hesitant as it said it gives you a tan &amp;#34;gradually&amp;#34; and I wanted one instantly. I tried Jergens finally and am so glad I did!  Pros: no exfoliating, faint nice smell, easy to use, doesn&#x27;t stain clothes or towels, sheets, bathroom floor, after 2 applications I had color, after 6 applications I have a gorgeous, natural, deep, dark, even brown tan, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, I shower then I use instead of lotion, dries in minutes, affordable, one tenth of price of other 2 I tried. Need I say more? I love this stuff! Wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted 2 months trying the other stuff.  Cons: hard to find at store, often out of stock.  Just a suggestion, for my hands I wash them after applying to body, then I use a cotton ball and spray mouse on it, apply to hands and fingers then I use a Wet Wipe to wipe any excess off palms. So far hands look like the rest of my body and palms are not stained.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever.  Goes on really well. No brown hands. No streaks on my scary, hairy, lily-white legs.</li>
    <li> Jergens is my favorite brand of self-tanner due to color, smell, &amp; price. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of self tanning products and I highly recommend this one or the cream version which I prefer over the foam. I posted a video on my website CherylMartinez .com  discussing the best self-tanning products, tips &amp; tricks if you want to check it out!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best. I&#x27;m pretty pale, so I&#x27;d been using the fair to medium lotion for the longest time. The foam is SO much better, and I&#x27;m glad I went darker. I was afraid it might make me orange, but nope. Normal skin color. I hate the greasy, thick feeling of lotion on my skin, so this is perfect. Just be sure to wash your hands well, because otherwise it looks like you karate chopped henna tattoo ink. Also, be sure to exfoliate. If you don&#x27;t, color builds up and looks weird.</li>
    <li> I love this!  I have always used the Jergens Natural Glow Lotion but this goes on so much smoother and seems to show the color more quickly.  I will keep buying this product.  It works!</li>
    <li> goes on easy and evenly.  really like the foam application.  dries fast and is not sticky. someone with extra dry skin may want add a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I can&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s so difficult to find it on the shelves.  I have had great fortune to find other items on Amazon that have left the shelves in my area.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service</li>
    <li> This is an OK product in comparison to the Jergens lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: I do not find the smell to be unpleasant as other reviewers have said. Although I only put it on my legs, so that may be why I don&#x27;t mind it. I&#x27;ve used the Jergens self tanning lotion for a few years. It works great, except it takes awhile to dry and can feel tacky later if I sweat or when the weather is humid. The foam does not feel tacky at all and dries rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON: The dryer areas of skin such as my knees and ankles end up having much more spotting and streaking in comparison to the lotion. I do exfoliate and this was not a major problem for me when using the Jergens tanning lotion. I remedied it for now by putting regular lotion on those areas before I put on this product. Another reviewer recommended mixing them together. I may try that.</li>
