      <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t know an eye concealer brush existed-</li>
      <li>I have to be honest</li>
      <li>Who has time to put each brush in its own pouch?</li>
      <li>The brush came with a case made of &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; plastics which is nice but probably unessesary and is A bit of over packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like that the ferrule is made of recycled aluminum and is nicely decorated.  </li>
      <li>However, I  liked it .</li>
      <li>Love this brush--it&#x27;s drastically improved the way I apply concealer, and looks so much better than blending with my finger!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft bristles smooths out concealer to a flawless finish.</li>
      <li>I am a fan of the EcoTools lime and own many of their brushes.</li>
      <li>The brush is made of nicely cut, fine, densely packed bristles.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad to recommend it.</li>
      <li>I love the packaging and the colors.  </li>
      <li>a bit worked better than &#x27;pouncing&#x27; the concealer.  </li>
      <li>My eyes look a lot better too.  </li>
      <li>Basically it can replace finger tip application for most areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The brush is mostly advertised for use around the eyes but</li>
      <li>LOVE this brush.  </li>
      <li>This brush blends the area much better.</li>
      <li>I love EcoTools brushes and this one is no exception.  </li>
      <li>Although shaped like a finger, it seems to have a lighter and more even touch.</li>
      <li>Now, I love the size.  </li>
      <li>I love how it feels on my face.  </li>
      <li>The first day I used it it was so soft and just a flawless application.  </li>
      <li>I love that it boosts being Eco friendly.  </li>
      <li>rounded tip of the brush mimics the shape of a finger for easy application under and around the eyes.</li>
      <li>The result is a smooth natural looking application that provides great coverage.</li>
      <li>Smooth and reduce appearance of fine lines and under eye circles</li>
      <li>The fibers are soft and smooth and densley packed, so there is a heft to it that allows you you blend more effectively.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great brush, especially for the price.  </li>
      <li>They all clean easily and work well.</li>
      <li>The bristles are so close together and precisely cut that they don&#x27;t appear brush-like at all.</li>
      <li>Product goes on smoothly and evenly.</li>
      <li>but I find it most useful for concealer.</li>
      <li>The smooth bristles also apply product evenly, with no streaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far, I have cleaned it 3 times ( fairly vigorously to test it) and it still looks like it is made of foam.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice blending brush but it is quite large, so it is really going to blend together all of the lid/crease colors rather than be able to blend just the edges of where the two colors meet.  </li>
      <li>I recently bought the Smashbox contouring and highlighting sticks kit, and this works so much more nicely than using my fingers to blend in the products.  </li>
      <li>I have dark under eye circles and this really worked well to apply concealer with a flawless appearance.</li>
      <li>Even using it with powders, I could not find a good use for this brush in my daily makeup routine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice plus that it&#x27;s nice looking, all natural and &amp;#34;Eco-friendly&amp;#34; and even has its own little storage pouch, which I like for cleanliness since it&#x27;s being used around my eye area.</li>
      <li>The fingertip approach works fine, but oils from your own finger can affect the consistency and application, and afterwards I&#x27;m left with eye concealer</li>
      <li>always sometimes apply concealer around my nose since I tend to have redness there, and this works perfectly to get into the creases along the sides since it&#x27;s much smaller than a traditional foundation</li>
      <li>It felt good to my face, sometimes I&#x27;d scratch myself with my own nails, how dumb is that right?</li>
      <li>It mimics your finger, but works better in evening out your make up for a natural look and feel.</li>
      <li>The handle is wooden, which feels nice in your hands.</li>
      <li>Right there is another plus.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really useful nice brush that I will continue to use daily and highly recommend!</li>
      <li>This is a very fine brush for the application of facial cosmetics.  </li>
      <li>I squeeze a small amount of my favorite concealer by Amazing Cosmetics on to the brush tip and apply it under my eyes (and into the bottom corner and top corner eyelid to blend) using the same dabbing motion I use when applying with my fingertip.</li>
      <li>If you are the type that prefers more distinct areas of color, you might want to look for something smaller.</li>
      <li>Also, no washing instructions were included but I tried washing the brush with a little liquid soap and it came out nice and clean and no bristles fell out.  </li>
      <li>I love that the tip is white</li>
      <li>The brush ferrule has a pretty design.</li>
      <li>With its decorated ferrule, it really is a pretty and practical addition to my army of makeup applicators.</li>
      <li>The base--the pretty teal aluminum band--is recycled.</li>
      <li>There is a lovely blue and gold wrapping between the handle and the brush.</li>
      <li>Reviewed by Lynn Holland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the product through the packaging, my first impression of the eye perfecting brush was that it was made of foam rubber.</li>
      <li>By dabbing in a quick motion, it provides good coverage and it works it into my undereye area rather than leaving it globby, thick or noticeably sitting on the surface.</li>
      <li>It allows a little more precise application than the foundation brush.</li>
      <li>I had been using a flat brush on my concealer but this is much better.</li>
      <li>I feel that using a flat concealer brush or your finger to apply creams is a better solution for me.</li>
      <li>The bristles are not only the softest, but they&#x27;re cruelty-free and easy to hand wash.</li>
      <li>When I saw this brush I thought, that is ridiculously large.  </li>
      <li>The brush is easy to clean (try a few drops of alcohol on a cotton pad).</li>
      <li>And the handle is bamboo, a fast growing, sustainable wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really?</li>
      <li>The bamboo handle is comfortable and the aluminum ferrule is visual</li>
      <li>The bristles are extremely soft, but efficient in applying concealer or lotion exactly where you want it.</li>
      <li>The small head size on this also allows me to nicely buff out the lines made with the contouring sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Straight, firm and most dense of all EcoTools brush bristles.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be adding more to my collection in the future.</li>
      <li>My main concern with the brush was that the bristle shape might change when the brush was cleaned.</li>
      <li>highly recommend to anyone looking to improve the way you apply concealer, foundation or eye cream.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I never knew I needed this until I had it. I have dark undereye circles (hereditary) and use Benefit&#x27;s Fake Up stick almost daily. I swipe on and blend w my fingers. This brush blends the area much better. It is firm, but not hard and shaped in a way so that it follows the curve of my eye well. A plus is that I&#x27;m applying less pressure to my delicate eye area when using this brush. I am a fan of the EcoTools lime and own many of their brushes. They all clean easily and work well.</li>
    <li> This is yet another great brush from ecotools. This eye perfecting brush is perfect for smoothing and blending my under eye concealer. It has a domed shape that fits the contours of my face. The fibers are soft and smooth and densley packed, so there is a heft to it that allows you you blend more effectively. It has a lightweight wood handle. Its shorter than the full size brushes, but larger than your typical travel size brush. I had been using a flat brush on my concealer but this is much better.</li>
    <li> This is a really great brush, and I am so impressed by the advancements in brush technology, which I would never have noticed if Vine wasn&#x27;t sending me these new brushes. This one is nifty because of it&#x27;s shape, texture and fullness. The brush has a dome shape, like a finger tip. The bristles are very thin, stiff, and tightly packed. The texture is luxurious, and it feels amazing against your skin.  The handle is wooden, which feels nice in your hands. There is a lovely blue and gold wrapping between the handle and the brush. It appears elegant and expensive, although the price is actually quite reasonable.  I&#x27;m using mine for eye shadow. After a certain age, it is difficult to apply eye shadow smoothly. The skin around the eyes is full of nooks and crannies, and the eye shadow tends to pile up in the wrong places. It was a problem, but now it is solved! The EcoTools Complex Collection Eye Perfecting Face Brush (It says &amp;#34;Blush&amp;#34; but I think they must mean &amp;#34;Brush&amp;#34;) is just the right tool for the job. It distributes the eye shadow evenly on my skin, and the powder doesn&#x27;t cake up in the creases, which is great. The brush is easy to clean (try a few drops of alcohol on a cotton pad). It is excellent in all ways.  I suggest you open the plastic case carefully and use it to store the brush in, to keep it clean.</li>
    <li> Reviewed by Lynn Holland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the product through the packaging, my first impression of the eye perfecting brush was that it was made of foam rubber. The bristles are so close together and precisely cut that they don&#x27;t appear brush-like at all. Getting it out of the environmentally friendly  package was a bit tricky to figure out and required clipping a stitch that held the thing closed. Although the pouch is touted as reusable, my makeup brushes live in a cup in the bathroom. Who has time to put each brush in its own pouch? The brush is great for blending concealer and foundation.. Although shaped like a finger, it seems to have a lighter and more even touch. Product goes on smoothly and evenly.My main concern with the brush was that the bristle shape might change when the brush was cleaned. So far, I have cleaned it 3 times ( fairly vigorously to test it) and it still looks like it is made of foam.  With its decorated ferrule, it really is a pretty and practical addition to my army of makeup applicators.</li>
    <li> I love EcoTools brushes and this one is no exception.  The brush ferrule has a pretty design. It&#x27;s a great shape for getting under the eye and around the nose.  Because of the density of this brush I found using a slight brushing movement - basically a flick- or rolling it a bit worked better than &#x27;pouncing&#x27; the concealer.  I use a very thick and pigmented concealer - I think a lighter formulation would work well with pouncing.  I could also see using this with eyelid primer, but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.</li>
    <li> This applicator is designed to use around the eyes but I found the bristles were too stiff to use in this area. Eco Tools is my go to brand for brushes, so I was very surprised that this did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I have a few Eco Tools makeup brushes, and love how they are cruelty-free and use recycled materials.  This eye brush is meant to be used to apply concealer around the eyes or to apply eye-care creams/lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head on this is slightly larger than the brush I currently use to blend in my concealer, but the arched head on it means that it gets into the inner eye area nicely.  The smooth bristles also apply product evenly, with no streaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always sometimes apply concealer around my nose since I tend to have redness there, and this works perfectly to get into the creases along the sides since it&#x27;s much smaller than a traditional foundation brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to using this to apply undereye concealer, I&#x27;ve also been using it to blend my contouring products.  I recently bought the Smashbox contouring and highlighting sticks kit, and this works so much more nicely than using my fingers to blend in the products.  The small head size on this also allows me to nicely buff out the lines made with the contouring sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is a uniquely sized and shaped brush, I&#x27;m not sure what else it would work for.  It&#x27;s definitely not a multi-purpose brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also comes in a cute little fabric pouch that you can re-use or store it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great brush, especially for the price.  Eco Tools brushes hold up well, last a long time, and don&#x27;t shed after washing.  I&#x27;ll definitely be adding more to my collection in the future.</li>
    <li> LOVE this brush.  It works great for concealer under your eyes.  This brush is soooo soft.  I love the packaging and the colors.  This is a very nice brush and I highly recommend it.  I have dark under eye circles and this really worked well to apply concealer with a flawless appearance.</li>
    <li> This is a very fine brush for the application of facial cosmetics.  The brush is made of nicely cut, fine, densely packed bristles.  I like that the ferrule is made of recycled aluminum and is nicely decorated.  The handle is made of bamboo and should last nearly forever.  The brush came with a case made of &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; plastics which is nice but probably unessesary and is A bit of over packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is mostly advertised for use around the eyes but during the application of concealer under the eye, it was noted that the brush tended to pull the skin.  It was easier to use a finger than the brush.  That being said, the brush did excell at applying cream blush and other products around the face.  It works very well at feathering the edges and blending blush and other cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only major complaint is that the brush does not come with any instructions or suggestions as to how to clean it.  This information can be found by searching the internet however.</li>
    <li> As a freelance makeup artist, I was not happy with this brush but usually like the EcoTools line of brushes.This particular brush is too thick and hard and struggles to apply concealers in a way that blends smoothly. Even using it with powders, I could not find a good use for this brush in my daily makeup routine. I feel that using a flat concealer brush or your finger to apply creams is a better solution for me. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
    <li> This is a nice blending brush but it is quite large, so it is really going to blend together all of the lid/crease colors rather than be able to blend just the edges of where the two colors meet.  If you are going for a nice smooth gradation between all colors (like a smokey eye), this would be great.  If you are the type that prefers more distinct areas of color, you might want to look for something smaller.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this EcoTools brush for applying eye concealer! It can also be used for applying your eye cream, though I am dedicating it to eye concealer. I honestly didn&#x27;t know an eye concealer brush existed- I&#x27;ve always just used my fingertip in a dabbing motion for applying concealer under my eyes. The fingertip approach works fine, but oils from your own finger can affect the consistency and application, and afterwards I&#x27;m left with eye concealer I need to wipe off on a towel or wash off of my finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This EcoTools brush is shaped like a fingertip and made of dense but soft bristles that feel comfortable even in my delicate eye area. I squeeze a small amount of my favorite concealer by Amazing Cosmetics on to the brush tip and apply it under my eyes (and into the bottom corner and top corner eyelid to blend) using the same dabbing motion I use when applying with my fingertip. By dabbing in a quick motion, it provides good coverage and it works it into my undereye area rather than leaving it globby, thick or noticeably sitting on the surface. The result is a smooth natural looking application that provides great coverage. I personally like to follow with my all over face foundation that I blend up into my undereye area where I&#x27;ve applied my undereye concealer, so it all blends together well for a seamless transition and it takes attention away from my dark circles, which I&#x27;ve pretty much always suffered from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really an excellent eye concealer brush and something I never even knew existed! It&#x27;s a nice plus that it&#x27;s nice looking, all natural and &amp;#34;Eco-friendly&amp;#34; and even has its own little storage pouch, which I like for cleanliness since it&#x27;s being used around my eye area. Also, no washing instructions were included but I tried washing the brush with a little liquid soap and it came out nice and clean and no bristles fell out.  It&#x27;s a really useful nice brush that I will continue to use daily and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love the shape, feel and look of the ECOTOOLS COMPLEX COLLECTION EYE PERFECTING FACE BRUSH. I ordered it for applying products I purchase for under my eyes to help conceal dark circles. The tip is the perfect shape, stiffness and texture. It mimics your finger, but works better in evening out your make up for a natural look and feel. The bamboo handle is comfortable and the aluminum ferrule is visual pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Smooth and reduce appearance of fine lines and under eye circles&lt;br /&gt;• Recycled aluminum ferrules&lt;br /&gt;• Sleek bamboo handles&lt;br /&gt;• Cruelty-free bristles&lt;br /&gt;• Use with creams, moisturizers, or concealers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rounded tip of the brush mimics the shape of a finger for easy application under and around the eyes. Straight, firm and most dense of all EcoTools brush bristles. Allows for optimal blending and coverage of fine lines and dark circles.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a &#x27;concealer&#x27; brush, so I tried it w my concealer. Meh - I wouldn&#x27;t have bought a brush to use for concealer, but I tried it and wasn&#x27;t impressed - it&#x27;s kinda big to use for under eye concealer, so I also tried it for eyeshadow. It&#x27;s too big to work well for eye shadow and too small to work well for blush, so bottom line - unless you are in love w make-up brushes and want one for every single thing, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> This eye perfecting face brush from EcoTools is the perfect brush to apply concealer below your eyes. You can also use it to apply a night cream or lotion for spot treatment but I find it most useful for concealer. It can also work as a contouring brush if you like to apply a little lighter or darker foundation in some areas of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has relatively stiff bristles than some brushes but still soft and are good for the delicate under eye area and helps with the blending of the product. It allows a little more precise application than the foundation brush. It&#x27;s also narrow enough to be dipped into some foundation bottles so if you prefer to apply a little extra foundation under your eyes rather than concealer it works well for that purpose. I often use this brush to also apply the primer above my eyes. Basically it can replace finger tip application for most areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to clean with a little warm water and a few drops of a gentle clear shampoo and can be left to soak for an hour and then dried off. I also like EcoTools for their sturdy handles and earthy bamboo feel. They are well made and usually do not shed. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice brush! It has a long handle and a medium size soft bristle head. It comes in a fabric pouch. It says it&#x27;s for under the eyes but I&#x27;m not sure what you would put under your eyes with a brush?? I will probably use it for another part of my face.</li>
    <li> Love this brush--it&#x27;s drastically improved the way I apply concealer, and looks so much better than blending with my finger! It&#x27;s soft bristles smooths out concealer to a flawless finish. My skin great when I use this to apply my concealer. I also use this brush around my nose too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like EcoTools makes the BEST brushes. The bristles are not only the softest, but they&#x27;re cruelty-free and easy to hand wash. The base--the pretty teal aluminum band--is recycled. And the handle is bamboo, a fast growing, sustainable wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend to anyone looking to improve the way you apply concealer, foundation or eye cream.</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect for detailing around the eyes, especially useful for those who have shown some aging lines that need additional touch ups.  The shape and softness is perfect for the purpose.  The eco-friendly manufacturing is a plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a great quality brush. The bristles are extremely soft, but efficient in applying concealer or lotion exactly where you want it. I would recommend this brush to people who like using brushes to apply their concealer and liquid foundation. It makes a great addition to a makeup brush set.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, the brush is to stiff so it does not really blend well. The bristles are too dense to the point where it&#x27;s rough  and irritated the skin. Wouldn&#x27;t reccomend.</li>
    <li> So good for my tender skin around my eyes.  I quite prefer to blend makeup with my fingers, but I press or rub too hard, I end up using far more makeup then I should and it goes to waste.  I have another small brush I had been using for applying concealer, and primer.  When I saw this brush I thought, that is ridiculously large.  Really? Hmmm, about the same shape as a fingertip, perhaps it isn&#x27;t too large.  The first day I used it it was so soft and just a flawless application.  Now, I love the size.  I love how it feels on my face.  I love that the tip is white so you know when it needs a cleaning.  I love the little pouch it comes in, and now all my brushes are hanging out together in it.  I love that it boosts being Eco friendly.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with this brush.  My eyes look a lot better too.  You save money using brushes because you use less makeup and when you use less makeup, you look more natural as well.</li>
    <li> I have to be honest I have always just used my finger when applying makeup or concealing  creams under my eyes so using this was new to me.  However, I  liked it . It felt good to my face, sometimes I&#x27;d scratch myself with my own nails, how dumb is that right? Anyway, I used my concealing cream with this and it went on smooth, no problems and for once my fingers were not all messy. Right there is another plus. I like this product and I think you will as well. I&#x27;m glad to recommend it. It really is nice to use, feels good on the face.</li>
