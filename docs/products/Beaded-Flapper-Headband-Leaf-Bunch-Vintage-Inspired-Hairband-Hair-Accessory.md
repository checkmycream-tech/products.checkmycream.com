      <li>I am pleased to say it lives up to those expectations.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Most head bands of this type tend to hurt my head</li>
      <li>Many people complemented me on it.</li>
      <li>Lovely headpiece- came just as ordered.</li>
      <li>It was cute and comfortable.</li>
      <li>but this one is so comfortable</li>
      <li>So comfortable that I almost forgot I was wearingit</li>
      <li>Light weight on your head doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to wear.  </li>
      <li>Headband came quickly, was well packaged and fit well.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable, and fits my head really well.  </li>
      <li>Super comfortable and very well made!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t normally wear headbands, but it&#x27;s SO cute.  </li>
      <li>Very pretty in person, well made.</li>
      <li>The headband is very pretty, and well made.  </li>
      <li>doesnt sit right on head</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wearing it right now.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a good size and covers almost half of your head, which I like since it is inherently of 1920s style.</li>
      <li>I really liked about this was that although I purchased it for a 1920s costume, it&#x27;s still way understated from the traditional 1920s feather headpieces, and I can easily wear it with a regular dress.</li>
      <li>Looked exactly like the picture.</li>
      <li>I have had to switch to headbands because my hair is fine, and I can&#x27;t find clips the right size to hold it back off my face.  </li>
      <li>Lays nice and flat, and is lightweight, so it looks dressy and you barely know it is on.</li>
      <li>The beading detail is of great quality, though I did see a few tiny spots where the beads didn&#x27;t connect or perhaps split apart from bending.</li>
      <li>It is well made and reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>It was comfortable and just enough sparkle.</li>
      <li>Fashionable, fit my big head.  </li>
      <li>The metal band itself is beautifully and neatly wrapped in black fabric (including the edges of it), which makes it comfortable around your head and behind your ears - no scratching of the scalp or skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Would recomend highly.</li>
      <li>I chose this headband over others because it looked like something I could wear normally without it looking out of place.  </li>
      <li>However, I only noticed it right now as I inspected it for the video review, so it wasn&#x27;t anything glaring that made me not want to wear it.</li>
      <li>Usually headbands fit too tight on my head and give me a headache after a while, but this one is very comfortable</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a grown, 30-year old woman, and I can&#x27;t wait to wear this headband.  </li>
      <li>The beading is backed with felt material and is soft and bendable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to get a lot of use out of it, and it&#x27;s going to be so fun to have, especially for my next trip to NOLA!</li>
      <li>The tips have a dramatic bend which were an issue while wearing my glasses, but I plan to bend them to be more straight and out of the way.</li>
      <li>Plus, it has nice charm because of the subtle imperfections due to the fact that it was made by hand.</li>

    <li> Headband came quickly, was well packaged and fit well.  Comfortable--not too tight, but does the job. Used it for Halloween flapper costume, but can use it for regular wear, also.  Lies flat on my head and can be used on either side.</li>

    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo17HHDA76D1LRE]]I purchased this headband as an accessory for a 1920s costume. For a handmade item of this craftsmanship, I thought it would be more expensive. The headband is elegantly crafted and very comfortable. The beading detail is of great quality, though I did see a few tiny spots where the beads didn&#x27;t connect or perhaps split apart from bending. However, I only noticed it right now as I inspected it for the video review, so it wasn&#x27;t anything glaring that made me not want to wear it. The beading is backed with felt material and is soft and bendable. It&#x27;s also a good size and covers almost half of your head, which I like since it is inherently of 1920s style. The metal band itself is beautifully and neatly wrapped in black fabric (including the edges of it), which makes it comfortable around your head and behind your ears - no scratching of the scalp or skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really liked about this was that although I purchased it for a 1920s costume, it&#x27;s still way understated from the traditional 1920s feather headpieces, and I can easily wear it with a regular dress. Plus, it has nice charm because of the subtle imperfections due to the fact that it was made by hand. You don&#x27;t usually find stuff like that on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Beautiful fits perfectly and arrived in great shape and in good time.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this ! Super comfortable and very well made! I can not wait to wear it to The wedding a bought it for. It will match my dress great! Most head bands of this type tend to hurt my head but this one is so comfortable I almost didn&#x27;t know I had it on! I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very nice headband!  Usually headbands fit too tight on my head and give me a headache after a while, but this one is very comfortable and I can wear it all day without feeling tension.  I bought it for a 1920’s Gatsby-style costume, which it worked perfectly for.  I chose this headband over others because it looked like something I could wear normally without it looking out of place.  I am pleased to say it lives up to those expectations.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I&#x27;m wearing it right now.  I have had to switch to headbands because my hair is fine, and I can&#x27;t find clips the right size to hold it back off my face.  I tried plain headbands, but they were too boring, so I decided to go a little fancier, and I just love them.  It also arrived ahead of time and I would order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Attended a ball with a Gatsby theme and this headband was the perfect accessory.  So comfortable that I almost forgot I was wearingit and it completed my 20&#x27;s look.</li>
    <li> I bought this headband for a flapper costume and it&#x27;s nice enought I&#x27;d wear it again for occasions other than Halloween.</li>
    <li> Rave reviews, great quality...I only purchased it for one night, but have worn it several times since and always get lots of compliments!</li>
    <li> I  give the Handmade Beaded Leaf Bunch Flapper Fashion Headband Hair Accessory a five star rating! It&#x27;s comfortable to wear.  This will go well with my outfit for a 1920&#x27;s party.  It is well made and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This is beautiful!  i wore it with my Flapper Girl costume and the beading detail was perfect.  It was comfortable and just enough sparkle.</li>
