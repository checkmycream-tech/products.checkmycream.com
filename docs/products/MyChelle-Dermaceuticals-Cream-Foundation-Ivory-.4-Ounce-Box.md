      <li>This is a great foundation.</li>
      <li>The ivory is great in winter, but maybe not as great in the summer.  </li>
      <li>but I does not have good coverage.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does have its draw backs, but the product is good.</li>
      <li>It smells good</li>
      <li>I think you could solve this with a good finishing powder though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I love this foundation!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s creamy texture is perfect for my dry skin and the ivory is a perfect match for my fair to light skin.</li>
      <li>Works nicely.</li>
      <li>Also it has a nice fruity smell.</li>
      <li>perfect amount of coverage and kind to sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This makeup is perfect for some one looking for a makeup that is gentle on skin and free of chemicals.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love! :)</li>
      <li>It sat on top of my skin and would slide off my face within hours of applying it</li>
      <li>went to myhcelle web site to learn more.</li>
      <li>So I went out on a limb and tried MyChelle and fell in love.</li>
      <li>I am sure if you are knowledgable in applying makeup you could make it work for you.</li>
      <li>It is for people who do not have many skin issues to cover.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now using it with another foundation for better coverage.</li>
      <li>flippin love this stick thingy</li>
      <li>After using for a week, I feel my skin even looks better.</li>
      <li>beautiful natural tint.</li>
      <li>It smells lovely, and goes on easily.</li>
      <li>It feels great on my skin and has not made me break out at all even though I have very sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>: I suffer from lots of allergies and sensitivities, so organic, non-GMO, and gluten free are very important to me.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the feeling that I&#x27;m using something all-natural and chemical free and</li>
      <li>one layer will give you light coverage, I do 2 or 3 for more of a medium coverage and it never looks cakey.</li>
      <li>also more importantly - cruelty free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>Fast service, love this product as an under eye concealer!</li>
      <li>I can honestly say this is my favorite so far!</li>
      <li>this particular shade is good for people with fair/light skin, cool or neutral skin tone.</li>
      <li>This product smells fantastic, like a light mix of flowers and fruit.  </li>
      <li>It is very much a light coverage foundation though.</li>
      <li>My skin looks smooth and even when I wear this.</li>
      <li>I have fairly light skin, but am not a porcelain.</li>
      <li>With the right sponge, you would enjoy this!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s free of toxins and so clean that even if I don&#x27;t wash it off at night, it doesn&#x27;t causes blemishes.</li>
      <li>This stick (which I use just like a pastel stick, which is fun and awesome) somehow manages to blend into or over my pores, making them way less visible.  </li>
      <li>This one is more of a matte finish than the cashmere, but still pretty creamy.</li>
      <li>Overall, good product.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this foundation</li>
      <li>was looking for a foundation to do my mature skin justice and have good things in it, rather than chemicals-wax and petrolium-mineral powder makeup,have tried a few times-only to find it always it aging my skin,never happy with appearance.</li>
      <li>This is the first  cream foundation that I am totally taken in with-matchs perfectly, skin looks healthy dewy,when u first apply it, it has sort of a wet feel,but, vanishes quickly , turning into a lovely matte dewy look.</li>
      <li>I love how easy it is to apply, I love the simple gluten-free ingredients, and it looks so natural on my skin.</li>
      <li>Another amazing point is that I also have flakey skin; this product, being a tad oilier than regular foundation, really helps smooth out the flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There is a perfect balance of pink and yellow undertones.</li>
      <li>But this is actually quite nice.  </li>
      <li>This product wins.</li>
      <li>And the Ivory is powder white - would be good for people who don&#x27;t really tan.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this foundation to anyone who is moving away from the standard store-bought makeup and is taking that leap into the all-natural + cruelty free world! :)</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t won over by this right away.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had this product for 3 days, but am very happy to leave a 5 star review (of course I will come back if this product doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype in the future).&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s excellent for applying a natural looking thin coat with light to medium cover.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true that this makeup does give a very even matted look to your skin.</li>
      <li>Was better than expected, great smell and isn&#x27;t a heavy look on my face.</li>
      <li>Overall, I have to say that my skin has never looked better with makeup.</li>
      <li>As soon as I swipe it over the red areas, they magically disappear.  </li>
      <li>My only caveat is that I wish they had more graduated colors.  </li>
      <li>I do like this line, but the stick foundation was very waxy and just not for me.</li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>The coverage is really nice as well - somewhat matte without being too cakey and doesn&#x27;t get trapped in any wrinkles you might have.  </li>
      <li>I am glad that I read the tip on letting your lotion dry completely before putting on this foundation.</li>
      <li>Additionally, if you are warm or have oily skin, this makeup might slick up on you and make you look shiny.</li>
      <li>I am VERY pale and this color blends in nicely to my pasty complexion,</li>
      <li>Not as heavy as I first thought and easy to blend in.</li>
      <li>I continue to buy this brand and highly recommend this foundation.</li>
      <li>The ivory is the closest match to my skin color, and I use a bronzer to add a healthy glow, otherwise I still look a little washed out.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin a little glossy and oily but that&#x27;s okay,</li>
      <li>I have been using MyChelle Foundation for a few years now, and I love it.  </li>
      <li>If you have flaws that you want to cover (the purpose for wearing makeup) and have normal skin, I would not recommend this at all.</li>
      <li>It does feel a little heavy on but that&#x27;s because it gives great coverage.</li>
      <li>I have always used liquid foundation before this and it was a new experience with this cream &#x27;stick foundation&#x27;.</li>
      <li>The coverage is nice to give you a subtle glow.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it does look a bit shiny/oily by the end of the day, however I have extremely oily skin and no foundation I have found seems to be able to combat that.</li>
      <li>I do wear a light dusting of powder over it because I have slightly oily skin.</li>
      <li>I honestly can&#x27;t find a negative thing to say about foundation!</li>
      <li>I have been trading all my makeup out for all natural brands and found this.</li>
      <li>It looks only mildly worn by the end of a long day (but could just be the powder, not the foundation.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>especially with natural ingredients!</li>
      <li>Also, it does settle into creases and lines— I am not a pro in make up, but I have recently switch to bare minerals liquid foundation and do not have this issue any longer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been cursed with fairly large pores and a slight reddish tinge to my cheeks.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s just sheer enough to look natural, and just heavy enough to diminish flaws.</li>
<li> WAYYY too light for my skin, but I can use it as a very subtle highlighter if I&#x27;m careful.</li>
<li> The color is very close to my hard to match skin color.</li>
<li> The Cashmere is a medium beige - about fake bake color (can be used as a cream bronzer for light skin tones).</li>
<li> It also lasts a long time.  </li>
<li> Finishing powder definitely helps it from staying wet.</li>
<li> I also found that letting this foundation have about 5-7 min to dry before putting on finishing powder helped.</li>
<li> godsend for dry skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fast service, love this product as an under eye concealer!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s taken a little getting used to after using a liquid foundation, but I won&#x27;t ever go back to putting chemicals on my face. Plus, this product is actually good for your skin! Fight wrinkles AND feel beautiful... you can&#x27;t go wrong. The ivory is the closest match to my skin color, and I use a bronzer to add a healthy glow, otherwise I still look a little washed out. I look forward to a broader range of colors... and a MyChelle bronzer would be great!</li>
    <li> It smells good but I does not have good coverage.</li>
    <li> I have fairly light skin, but am not a porcelain. I couldnt find a color guide for this product anywhere, or even color numbers to tell which was darker or lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the Ivory and Cashmere and hoped I could blend them if one of them didn&#x27;t match. There MUST be another color between these. The Cashmere is a medium beige - about fake bake color (can be used as a cream bronzer for light skin tones). And the Ivory is powder white - would be good for people who don&#x27;t really tan. WAYYY too light for my skin, but I can use it as a very subtle highlighter if I&#x27;m careful. The Ivory doesn&#x27;t blend the same way the Cashmere does, and I think it&#x27;s because of whatever they used to make it white (chalk? talc? zinc?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For texture, this is slightly less creamy than the Cashmere, probably because of the lighter pigment material. It&#x27;s excellent for applying a natural looking thin coat with light to medium cover. This one is more of a matte finish than the cashmere, but still pretty creamy. The smell reminds me of apricot oil. If you apply this fairly thinly, it can also take a thin layer of powder. Overall, good product. Hope I can find the in-between color!</li>
    <li> I honestly can&#x27;t find a negative thing to say about foundation! I love how easy it is to apply, I love the simple gluten-free ingredients, and it looks so natural on my skin. It&#x27;s just sheer enough to look natural, and just heavy enough to diminish flaws. I do wear a light dusting of powder over it because I have slightly oily skin. It looks only mildly worn by the end of a long day (but could just be the powder, not the foundation.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I suffer from lots of allergies and sensitivities, so organic, non-GMO, and gluten free are very important to me. I can honestly say this is my favorite so far!</li>
    <li> Thick and greasy feeling.  Not much coverage.  Very disappointing as I like their other products.  Tossing this.</li>
    <li> beautiful stick foundation made with oils. godsend for dry skin. it will never make you feel tight faced midday or accentuate wrinkles and pores. this particular shade is good for people with fair/light skin, cool or neutral skin tone. i also have \\&quot;Latte\\&quot; color that has  yellow undertone, it fits  light/medium skin. one layer will give you light coverage, I do 2 or 3 for more of a medium coverage and it never looks cakey. I have dry skin but wouldn&#x27;t wear it in the summer, too oily. you can set it with loose mineral  powder or leave as is, it stays put. corresponding concealer color to this shade is \\&quot;cream\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Ordered this, after reading up abit on web. was looking for a foundation to do my mature skin justice and have good things in it, rather than chemicals-wax and petrolium-mineral powder makeup,have tried a few times-only to find it always it aging my skin,never happy with appearance.This is the first  cream foundation that I am totally taken in with-matchs perfectly, skin looks healthy dewy,when u first apply it, it has sort of a wet feel,but, vanishes quickly , turning into a lovely matte dewy look.After using for a week, I feel my skin even looks better.Do not feel bad ,if I forget to take my makeup off at night ,and wear to bed.ordered the peony blush also. beautiful natural tint.I have searched and so happy I took a chance on something I never knew of till coming accross it on Amazon. went to myhcelle web site to learn more. doubt if I will ever use anything else.It is like I am not wearing makeup, I just look good.thank u mychelle</li>
    <li> It felt oily on my face. I do not have oily skin and this just felt weird. It sat on top of my skin and would slide off my face within hours of applying it (and I did use a powder to set it). It did not cover tiny flaws either. If you have flaws that you want to cover (the purpose for wearing makeup) and have normal skin, I would not recommend this at all.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation! It&#x27;s creamy texture is perfect for my dry skin and the ivory is a perfect match for my fair to light skin. There is a perfect balance of pink and yellow undertones. Furthermore, it&#x27;s cruelty-free and chemical-free! This is the only foundation for me! Love, love, love! :)</li>
    <li> I do like this line, but the stick foundation was very waxy and just not for me.</li>
    <li> perfect amount of coverage and kind to sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this foundation but I just don&#x27;t.  Took me awhile to get use to the fact that its not a liquid or in a round compact.  I just don&#x27;t find that it covers well. I&#x27;m now using it with another foundation for better coverage. I don&#x27;t think I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Was better than expected, great smell and isn&#x27;t a heavy look on my face. Color was a perfect match for me</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t won over by this right away.  It felt odd on my skin. I was used to the tinted moisturizer I was wearing which is very sheer.  But this is actually quite nice.  Not as heavy as I first thought and easy to blend in. The coverage is really nice as well - somewhat matte without being too cakey and doesn&#x27;t get trapped in any wrinkles you might have.  My skin looks smooth and even when I wear this. My only caveat is that I wish they had more graduated colors.  The ivory is great in winter, but maybe not as great in the summer.  I haven&#x27;t tried it yet though and since it&#x27;s not super heavy - it may be sheer enough to work in the summer as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using MyChelle Foundation for a few years now, and I love it.  It&#x27;s not tested on animals. It&#x27;s free of toxins and so clean that even if I don&#x27;t wash it off at night, it doesn&#x27;t causes blemishes.</li>
    <li> I have been trading all my makeup out for all natural brands and found this. This is a great foundation. I think it gives very good medium coverage. It feels great on my skin and has not made me break out at all even though I have very sensitive and acne prone skin. The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it does look a bit shiny/oily by the end of the day, however I have extremely oily skin and no foundation I have found seems to be able to combat that. I continue to buy this brand and highly recommend this foundation.</li>
    <li> This product smells fantastic, like a light mix of flowers and fruit.  The coverage is nice to give you a subtle glow.  It is NOT good for people with serious acne or scarring.  It will cover under eye circles, and balance out your skin tone, but again it&#x27;s on the sheer side.  I apply a bronzer over it and it&#x27;s perfect.  It also lasts a long time.  I am VERY pale and this color blends in nicely to my pasty complexion, haha.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for 3 days, but am very happy to leave a 5 star review (of course I will come back if this product doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype in the future).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been cursed with fairly large pores and a slight reddish tinge to my cheeks. This stick (which I use just like a pastel stick, which is fun and awesome) somehow manages to blend into or over my pores, making them way less visible.  As soon as I swipe it over the red areas, they magically disappear.  It blends very well with the non-latex applicator, and doesn&#x27;t feel the slightest bit heavy.  Another amazing point is that I also have flakey skin; this product, being a tad oilier than regular foundation, really helps smooth out the flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I flippin love this stick thingy AND with subscribe and save it&#x27;s $10 less than Gabriel,  which I previously used (which also was watery and didn&#x27;t cover jack)  AND this stuff smells like a fruit rollup.  WIN win.  This product wins.</li>
    <li> This makeup is perfect for some one looking for a makeup that is gentle on skin and free of chemicals. It smells lovely, and goes on easily. It is very much a light coverage foundation though. It is for people who do not have many skin issues to cover. Also, it does settle into creases and lines— I am not a pro in make up, but I have recently switch to bare minerals liquid foundation and do not have this issue any longer. Additionally, if you are warm or have oily skin, this makeup might slick up on you and make you look shiny. I think you could solve this with a good finishing powder though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have its draw backs, but the product is good. I am sure if you are knowledgable in applying makeup you could make it work for you.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the coverage (or lack of) and I absolutely HATE the smell.  I will be returning this if possible!</li>
    <li> With the right sponge, you would enjoy this! especially with natural ingredients!</li>
    <li> Works nicely. Leaves my skin a little glossy and oily but that&#x27;s okay, I just put pressed powder over to tone it down.</li>
    <li> I tried Ecco Bella which is priced similarly and didn&#x27;t like it. So I went out on a limb and tried MyChelle and fell in love. The color is very close to my hard to match skin color. It does feel a little heavy on but that&#x27;s because it gives great coverage. Also it has a nice fruity smell. They&#x27;ve gained a customer!</li>
    <li> I am glad that I read the tip on letting your lotion dry completely before putting on this foundation. I have always used liquid foundation before this and it was a new experience with this cream &#x27;stick foundation&#x27;. I also found that letting this foundation have about 5-7 min to dry before putting on finishing powder helped. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this alone without finishing powder. Finishing powder definitely helps it from staying wet. Someone commented on the smell, I don&#x27;t smell anything. I think it&#x27;s fine. Also, use a buffing brush when blending it into your skin, that helps even out the foundation. Overall, I have to say that my skin has never looked better with makeup. It&#x27;s true that this makeup does give a very even matted look to your skin. I like it! I LOVE the feeling that I&#x27;m using something all-natural and chemical free and also more importantly - cruelty free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this foundation to anyone who is moving away from the standard store-bought makeup and is taking that leap into the all-natural + cruelty free world! :)</li>
