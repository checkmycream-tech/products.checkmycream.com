      <li>Nice feel, not greasy</li>

      <li>But I really liked what I saw in</li>
      <li>I have more products by Premier and am very pleased.</li>
      <li>in fact I find that the  very pleasant way that it absorbs greaselessly prompts me to use it on all those fine lines and wrinkles - which is virtually my whole face!!</li>
      <li>This is by far THE best stuff I have EVER come across.</li>
      <li>The date range given for delivery spanned 3 weeks, but the product arrived 1 day after the first date which was great.  </li>
      <li>Told me how absolutely beautiful I really was and cut the price again.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the great service too.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s a much better price than at at the mall kiosk.</li>
      <li>So glad I checked.</li>
      <li>So glad I found it here at Amazon.</li>
      <li>I love the products.</li>
      <li>Most cosmetics places that charge this amount, have a return policy.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>and I find I end up with more than needed</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, great price.  </li>
      <li>I love the products but the pump on the bottle with \\&quot;eye</li>
      <li>Most women are probably as I am, always looking for something to help with the aging process.  </li>
      <li>i used it at the mall where it was more money</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I checked out Amazon before purchasing at the exorbitant price from the mall kiosk.</li>
      <li>Nothing will make you 20 again, but with Amazon prices , I was able to afford  to try this product.  </li>
      <li>Both of these products are excellent for the sensitive skin around eyes -- the serum for daytime use to smooth wrinkles and the cream for nighttime moisturization.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more greasy.</li>
      <li>When I purchased them the last time and googled to find the best price, Amazon&#x27;s price was lowest for this pair of products.</li>
      <li>Save your money for a better product.</li>
      <li>Nothing works like a magic wand</li>
      <li>I love the product.</li>
      <li>I would love to buy it here</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I went ahead and ordered this set of two.  </li>
      <li>I love this product line.  </li>
      <li>I also use the \\&quot;damaged skin\\&quot; mask and love that as well.  </li>
      <li>I love the eye care serum.  </li>
      <li>The eye cream I use over my entire face, it is a wonderful cream.</li>
      <li>The best product I have used in a long time.  </li>
      <li>Seems to be a pretty good product.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant scent and you get a large amount for your money.</li>
      <li>It works really well on your eyes, the serum soaks in nicely and follow that up with cream and the fine lines start to disappear and your eye area is brightened up!</li>
      <li>Good eye cream for moisturizing but didn&#x27;t really see any difference in fine lines or wrinkles after a month.</li>
      <li>Sure looks great because when they put it on you for the first few minutes like any moisturizing product it makes you look great for about 15 minutes.  </li>
      <li>it will take time to see how well this works in the long run but as an avid fan of good face care prepared to spend but within a budget this is a great product.</li>
      <li>This kit makes a noticeable difference in the appearance of fine lines.</li>
      <li>It helps to diminish the fine lines and the bags under the eyes.</li>
      <li>it works just fine on this part; whereas for my eyes</li>
      <li>This is such a great product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m quite impressed with this Dead Sea eye care set and would recommend.  </li>
      <li>The price here is GREAT compared to the vendor I purchased from initially.  </li>
      <li>Buying them together was a bonus, convenient and a bit more economical.</li>
      <li>The serum feels drying, almost like smooth silicone once it dries.</li>
      <li>They are fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Love these products - they provide superior moisturizing properties that last all day</li>
      <li>I purchased the original product in the mall, and the re-ordered from Amazon, which was a huge cost savings.</li>
      <li>I am wondering if it even is a knockoff since the price was so cheap compared to what they say it costs originally.  </li>
      <li>These products on the other hand are simply incredible.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for 9 months, and have yet to find a significant difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>and you could see results from the first day of using i love this product</li>
      <li>Originally tried it from a Kiosk at the mall, but found if ever so affordable at Amazon.  </li>
      <li>What a great deal this set was, and I love these dead sea products.  </li>
      <li>but most of all so early in the shift process i feel much better.</li>
      <li>I got the limited package deal instead of the two separates like shown in the photo, but I am happy nonetheless.</li>
      <li>surprisingly, I find it has actually made a difference there, too.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it here for a much cheaper price.</li>
      <li>It really has helped with those lines for sure.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many eye care products and found this eye serum and eye cream combo to be very effective.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
      <li>When it got to a reasonable price I said sure I&#x27;ll try it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I usually use Gratiae but this seemed like a good option to try.  No complaints except that it is hard to get the tiny drop you need of the serum and I feel I waste it quickly.</li>
    <li> I am 39, have normal to dry skin with shiny patches in T zone and have been an avid Dermalogica user for many years. As a Canadian living in Durban South Africa i have always scrimped to buy good face stuff. I find that i need a change in product after a while and so after recommendations from a lady over 40 with beautiful skin I decided to give this a go. I have been using it for about 2 weeks and i apply it by tapping gently to all offending areas (around eyes, mouth and the 2 lines between my eyes twice a day) and i do see a difference but most of all so early in the shift process i feel much better. My skin is smoother, finer somehow and i like that it feels gentle going on, has sunscreen which doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and a very neutral smell. Also absorbes really well and so no shiny bits! it will take time to see how well this works in the long run but as an avid fan of good face care prepared to spend but within a budget this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Product was opened when I got it.</li>
    <li> Tried it at the store in our Vegas hotel. Loved it! But I definitely couldn&#x27;t justify the $159. So glad I found it here at Amazon. Thanks!</li>
    <li> First of all, I rarely leave reviews.  I felt that I should in this case, though.  Most women are probably as I am, always looking for something to help with the aging process.  I have to say this works.  Nothing will make you 20 again, but with Amazon prices , I was able to afford  to try this product.  I was introduced to this line by my daughter who gave me a gift of some of their creams.  I really loved it and saw a difference in my face, so I decided to try this one. It has a pleasant scent and you get a large amount for your money. My eyes seem very lifted now. I am eager to try other products in their line.  The packaging was perfect.</li>
    <li> The best product I have used in a long time.  It helps to diminish the fine lines and the bags under the eyes.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading the positive reviews.  I should have read the reviews more carefully.  This product does not reduce under eye puffiness in three minutes or overnight.  It does not work on puffiness.  I have used it for 4 months nows.  It does work on dark circles which are very much different than under eye puffiness.</li>
    <li> Ladies, I know most people don&#x27;t usually believe the claims of beauty products, myself included. Most are simply untrue. These products on the other hand are simply incredible. I have asthma and allergies to dust, dogs, and cats. My eyes are constantly puffy and dark, facing a barrrage of irritants at work and at home due to my two wondeful dogs, yet with the eye serum and cream the puffiness disappears within 3 minutes of application. No bull! My husband watched it happen when it was demonstrated on me in our local mall. He was so impressed, as was I, that he reccomended we purchase the set and did not flinch when he pulled out $160.00 for them. The set lasted for 12 months and was well worth it.It is even better when I can get something that works this well at less than half of what I originally paid.</li>
    <li> I love the products but the pump on the bottle with \\&quot;eye serum\\&quot; needs improvement. It is not designed properly and simply dispences too much product. There is nothing one can do to control it.</li>
    <li> I had this product applied at a kiosk at a mall.  Very skeptical was I.  However, within moments of applying it I saw an amazing difference in the texture and tone of the skin surrounding my eye.  My husband was with me and he, too, could see the visible change.  I did not purchase it at the kiosk as the price was exorbitant.  I did purchase it from a seller (cosmetics4less) via Amazon.  I have been using this product for less than a week and will definitely replenish when needed.  A little bit goes a long way so I don&#x27;t think that will be for quite some time.  The biggest change / improvement I noticed was a brightness around my eyes.  It also diminished fine lines and made the skin soft and silky.  The serum is a pump container and I find I end up with more than needed so I have started dabbing it on the lines between my brows and on my forehead and surprisingly, I find it has actually made a difference there, too.  I love this product line.  I also use the \\&quot;damaged skin\\&quot; mask and love that as well.  If you are looking for a quality eye serum and cream combo, don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this product.  It is wonderful.</li>
    <li> It can&#x27;t work well, so I won&#x27;t buy them again. I think the two products do not fit my skin.</li>
    <li> This product was sent from the US to Germany. It was stopped at the German customs and I had to pick it up and pay approx. 10 USD customs duties because the invoice was not pasted in a transparent pouch outside the parcel. this is very annoying.</li>
    <li> I love the products. The date range given for delivery spanned 3 weeks, but the product arrived 1 day after the first date which was great.  If you buy these products from the mall kiosks, the price is 2 to 3 times what it is here. The bottom line - good products at a good price.</li>
    <li> I tried this product out in a mall on the left eye area. I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference, it really worked.  The product lasts a long time and its light texture lets you glide over the delicate eye area. However,you need to buy through Amazon or you won&#x27;t be able to afford it from Premier mall store!</li>
    <li> I love the Dead Sea line all of it is very nice i used it at the mall where it was more money and i bought it then i found it here and guess what not going back to the mall.  good price and it got it to me on time thank you for ans great product and a great place o by it from.</li>
    <li> Both of these products are excellent for the sensitive skin around eyes -- the serum for daytime use to smooth wrinkles and the cream for nighttime moisturization. I find that many other eye-oriented products that I have tried sting my eyes but these do not -- and I have used these for several years. When I purchased them the last time and googled to find the best price, Amazon&#x27;s price was lowest for this pair of products.</li>
    <li> I tried this the first time at the mall. The salesperson told me that not only would it help with wrinkles, fine lines and puffiness but also reduce dark circles. I noticed immediate results. I&#x27;m glad I found it here for a much cheaper price. I have been using it regularly and I notice more and more results each day. Firmer and very smooth skin, less wrinkles, and my dark circles have diminished drastically. I have more products by Premier and am very pleased. A heads up, the salesperson told me to use the serum one month and skip it the next. Don&#x27;t know why exactly, but I figured I would pass that on.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone one this is a great product and you could see results from the first day of using i love this product</li>
    <li> Received the product, not really noticing any difference, using daily in eye area. Not sure I will re-purchase this product for the money spent.</li>
    <li> Love these products - they provide superior moisturizing properties that last all day long!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy and use these products!</li>
    <li> Good eye cream for moisturizing but didn&#x27;t really see any difference in fine lines or wrinkles after a month.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product. I started to develop some dry patches on my eyelids and I tried creams and medications but it always came back. I started using[[ASIN:B000WLBNDU PREMIER DEAD SEA PROFESSIONAL EYE CARE KIT (EYE SERUM + EYE CREAM) for a month now and those dry patches are gone! The lines under my eyes have diminished. I don&#x27;t look tired in the morning even though I am! I tossed away all my other products and sticking to premier dead sea forever!</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife, knowing that she liked this line of product from previous purchases. You can&#x27;t go wrong when you purchase for your wife what she likes.</li>
    <li> Like a few others I&#x27;ve read, I was introduced to this product at a mall kiosk... the demonstration that was done on my face had amazing results!  I think the products work and I&#x27;ve purchased some of their other products as well.</li>
    <li> What a great deal this set was, and I love these dead sea products.  They are fantastic.  Thanks for the great service too.</li>
    <li> I always receive this item on or before scheduled shipping time!!! I have noticed a difference in the lines around my eyes since i have been using both serum and cream. I started out just using the cream and saw a difference just by itself. Seems to be a pretty good product. I first found this cream in Las Vegas while on vacation. Apparently they use it in some spas there and the first time i purchased it I paid way too much for the creams. Luck me... i found it on Amazon and have been buying it ever since!!!!! Nothing works like a magic wand but this does help and results are noticeable!!!!</li>
    <li> The day I got this I did a patch test on my arm, it seemed fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I put it around my eyes and my right eye (the skin) started burning.&lt;br /&gt;I immediately washed it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been a week since that and I still have red puffy swollen eyes.  And a scab under my right eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an appt today to see my Dr to get this taken care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent an email to Premier asking them to pay for my medical expenses.</li>
    <li> We never heard this brand before. But my wife told me this is brand feels good.  So, it worth to try.</li>
    <li> I am a medical aesthetician and I read about this product and all of its glowing reviews.  Always on the look out for a new product I figured for the price I would give it a try. Maybe I could recommend it to my patients.  Well I wont.  It was crap.  No miracle in a jar.  Take it from someone who tells her patients what works and doesnt work.  This doesnt work.  Total bunk.  It will however moisturize your skin and that is it.  But if you are looking for long lasting skin tightening and moisture it claims it provides?  Look else where.</li>
    <li> Was in Vegas and got pulled into a booth for a sample of this product.  Very pricey there but really liked the serum.  When I got home, checked with Amazon and found the same serum for much less so I ordered.  Really helps my aging skin!  Love it!</li>
    <li> The Premiere Dead Sea Eye Care set was everything I had experienced and seen at the kiosk, only at a much more reasonable price. This has proven to be a great product for my undereye discoloration and puffiness. I don&#x27;t understand the extreme difference in kiosk prices and Amazon for the same product. I&#x27;m glad I checked out Amazon before purchasing at the exorbitant price from the mall kiosk. Thanks, Amazon.</li>
    <li> Woud reccommend to every woman.  Leaves area around eyes hydrated and dark circles greatly diminished. Been using for 4 years.</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering this combo set. The product is really good and works well under my eyes!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great price.  Love this line of dead sea products. This kit makes a noticeable difference in the appearance of fine lines. Will buy again from this seller</li>
    <li> I had heard about the wonders of Dead Sea cosmetics, but until I was approached -- or accosted -- in a mall last week by a lady selling them at a kiosk, I had not had an opportunity to try them.  This lady was aggressive to the max, being super friendly and complimentary while steering me toward her chair, and insisted on giving me a &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; -- which, of course, was a trial of her products.  She patted some eye serum and eye cream under one eye, and ran a non-stop monologue even though I kept telling her I had to leave to meet someone for lunch.  Finally she got around to answering my questions about price, and when she quoted $369 EACH (for the serum and cream), I almost choked.  Then she said that in honor of Passover (which was already over), the price had been lowered to a &amp;#34;mere&amp;#34; $240 EACH.  I told her flat out that I had better places to spend $500, and she again lowered the price to $200 EACH.  Still too much for me, I finally got away from her.  But I really liked what I saw in he mirror after using the products, so I went online, found that I could buy them through Amazon for 1/5 of the price, and ordered them.  After a few days of using the products, I really can see a decrease in puffiness -- in other words, I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product, and will probably buy other items from the same line.  Thanks again, Amazon.</li>
    <li> The package I received was in a case together, this picture shows two separate bottles although it is named the same, so not sure if I got the product I ordered.  The pump for the eye serum came broke, when I first used it, a huge amount of serum pored out, so now I have to take the cap off and use it like that, a lot is being wasted.  So far, not impressed with the product.  I am wondering if it even is a knockoff since the price was so cheap compared to what they say it costs originally.  Probably will not purchase again.  The lines are still there, haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet.  If I see a difference, will update my review.  I used Lancôme forever, so I wanted to try something different.</li>
    <li> I have bought these products separately before and was thrilled with the results.  Buying them together was a bonus, convenient and a bit more economical.</li>
    <li> First of all, this product arrived very promptly.  I have been using the Premier Dead Sea eye cream for what seems like a long time. The pot of cream lasted so long and has become an invaluable part of my beauty routine. I just love it for it&#x27;s wonderfully light texture which allows you to gently move the cream around as much as you want. There&#x27;s absolutely no dragging of the delicate skin around the eye with this cream.  I was about to re order the cream when I saw the package of the serum (which I had not previously been aware of) and eye cream together.  I&#x27;m so glad I went ahead and ordered this set of two.  The serum is a dream !  So silky that it just glides over the skin.  I adore it. I cleanse the skin, apply the serum and leave it to sink in for half an hour or so (my choice) then later apply the eye cream as usual. You only need very little of each product.  Imagination or not, I feel that after three weeks of this duo, the skin is smoothing out the worrying lines I was increasingly getting.  I would not want to be without this great duo.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and find it to be very good.  I plan to order it again when it is gone.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for those with delicate skin. It does not burn my skin like everything else.  I&#x27;ve used estee lauder before and it actually aggravated the skin around my eyes making me look worse. I recommend this brand to those who actually want to see results.</li>
    <li> Originally tried it from a Kiosk at the mall, but found if ever so affordable at Amazon.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I was first sold the eye serum from a vendor at a rodeo!  It really made a difference for me. I use it under the eye and also in between my brows on my \\&quot;concentration lines\\&quot;.  It really has helped with those lines for sure.  My husband actually noticed!  I was told my bottle would last a year from that vendor but it lasted 6 months.  I do use it morning and night. So I took to the internet and found them from this seller on Amazon.  The shipping estimate was way out there but my items arrived way faster so that was great.  In this order I also purchased the eye cream which I also really like.  Very nice consistency..not greasy..makeup goes over well..doesn&#x27;t make my mascara smudge.  I&#x27;m quite impressed with this Dead Sea eye care set and would recommend.  The price here is GREAT compared to the vendor I purchased from initially.  I&#x27;m very happy with the help these items give with fine lines and wrinkles and moisture.</li>
    <li> Not the same stuff as that bought at the kiosk in the mall. Just very average drug store quality.</li>
    <li> The Eye serum works well for me... it absorbs in without any greasy residue at all ! Not a lot is required at all.... in fact I find that the  very pleasant way that it absorbs greaselessly prompts me to use it on all those fine lines and wrinkles - which is virtually my whole face!! I tend to use the thicker cream of this duo as neck cream - it works just fine on this part; whereas for my eyes it&#x27;s more greasy.</li>
    <li> Always use .i recommend</li>
    <li> the product was expired , could tell by the&lt;br /&gt; bad smell.. when products smell that bad they are usually expired. very disapointing !</li>
    <li> I have used these products for a year now and wouldn&#x27;t be without them.  They really work and your skin feels wonderful.  It&#x27;s very reasonably priced through Amazon - and definately worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I got the limited package deal instead of the two separates like shown in the photo, but I am happy nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Horrible!  Have never used a cream or serum where I felt the need to reapply during the day. My skin feels so dry after a few hours. It&#x27;s like I didn&#x27;t put anything on my skin. This feels nothing like the serum and cream I tried from the kiosk. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> in any of these products don&#x27;t have unrealistic expectations.Nice feel, not greasy</li>
    <li> IT does not work as I expected to. Little disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have tried many eye care products and found this eye serum and eye cream combo to be very effective.&lt;br /&gt;They have a very creamy luxurious feel and sink right in leaving the eye area very hydrated.  I have combo to oily skin, but know the delicate nature of the skin in this area needs extra TLC.  I often wake to puffiness under my eyes and found that if I keep my eye cream/serums refrigerated&lt;br /&gt;they not only have double the shelf life, but also feel so refreshing on warmer days.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to purchase this line.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and a few other items from one of the kiosks at my local mall. I explicitly told them I have very sensitive skin and they told me that their products would not irritate. I purchased this along with some eye serum and cream. All burned my skin and made my eyes red. I went to return the items, and they would not take them stating their no return policy. Most cosmetics places that charge this amount, have a return policy. Do not risk trying these products as they will do anything to sell them and there is no guaranty backing them up and they will not return your money should the product be flawed.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product. It works really well on your eyes, the serum soaks in nicely and follow that up with cream and the fine lines start to disappear and your eye area is brightened up! And it&#x27;s a much better price than at at the mall kiosk.</li>
    <li> I received this product after being pressured at the mall kiosks.  Very trained pushy sales persons.  Told me I was so stunningly gorgeous he just had to share this product with me. Sure looks great because when they put it on you for the first few minutes like any moisturizing product it makes you look great for about 15 minutes.  I told him no and I would google it to research it and if I liked the tester on me and what the feedback said I would come back.  He cut the price immediately down to a fairly reasonable price as I was walking away. I said no thank you, he threw something else in for &amp;#34;free&amp;#34;. Told me how absolutely beautiful I really was and cut the price again. He must&#x27;ve needed to meet a quota. When it got to a reasonable price I said sure I&#x27;ll try it.  Listen to the aestheticians review on here. It just moisturizes no big miracle. Save your money for a better product.</li>
    <li> The eye care product does what it claims. Both my wife and I use it daily. We both recommend it but they should buy it on amazon it is about 1/4 of the price they get at the mall stands.</li>
    <li> YES! First time purchased in Hawaii  2 years ago and have used every since. Other products do not compare!</li>
    <li> Great eye serum it has worked great for me.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results after using entire bottle! Felt good though</li>
    <li> My eyes are beautiful already.</li>
    <li> I love the product. Keeps yhe color good under my eyes and age lines in check</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this based on other reviews, but have to say I don&#x27;t find it any more exciting or effective than other products out there.  I use it twice a day (occasionally only once a day), but cannot see any appreciable difference.</li>
    <li> I have used this product along time and just Love it ! - I purchase several times per year, always with the same outlet, Great Product, good price &amp; fast Service/Shipping -</li>
    <li> I love these products and this was a great price!  I love the eye care serum.  The eye cream I use over my entire face, it is a wonderful cream.</li>
    <li> Premier Dead Sea Eye Care Set was purchased for me by my daughter from Amazon. The Eye Serum dispenser stopped working well after about a week. It now dispenses far more eye serum than I need at one time, using up the eye serum at a faster rate. The serum feels drying, almost like smooth silicone once it dries. I don&#x27;t want to put it anywhere but around my eyes. The eye cream jar seal was slightly open. It was too much effort to return the products.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at  a mall the first time on a whim.  But vowed I would never pay that much again, no matter how much I love the product.&lt;br /&gt;And I didn&#x27;t.  Found this on Amazon.  So glad I checked.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 9 months, and have yet to find a significant difference in my skin. Keeping in mind that I was only using Lubriderm before, I expected to see a vast improvement. I did not. I like the feel and smell (or non smell) of the face cream, but the anti aging serum and the eye cream showed no improvement. I purchased the original product in the mall, and the re-ordered from Amazon, which was a huge cost savings. I will not re-order, because really....after 9 months, I should see some improvement.</li>
    <li> I tried this at the mall. The cost was much higher than threw amazon. I am pleased to find the same product at an affordable cost. The serum absorbs then I fallow with the eye cream. It works wonders! A tiny amount goes a lonng way, should last for many months.</li>
    <li> I would really like to know if this is the real Premier eye cream. I use the eye cream and pay $250.00 a jar. How can this be sold for so much less? I would love to buy it here if I knew it was the real eye cream. Forgive me for being skeptical.</li>
    <li> I applied to my face and immediately developed a burning sensation.  Felt like a chemical peel.</li>
    <li> This is by far THE best stuff I have EVER come across. So hard to find and so expensive but truly worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Works very well on fine lines and tired eyes. Much cheaper to purchase here vs. the mall. The only problem Is too much serum comes out of the pump.</li>
    <li> I had someone in a mall try to sell me this at 9 times the price. Of course they let me &#x27;try&#x27;  it on the spot, and I saw what the product could do.  Imagine my surprise when I walked away and looked it up on Amazon! I&#x27;m very happy with the product and the price!</li>
