      <li>Good.</li>
      <li>and I thought they would be really good for transporting brushes, I just didn&#x27;t know where to buy them.</li>
      <li>His brush fit perfectly and he loved it.  </li>
      <li>The best part is the COOL twisting way that it opens and closes and secures itself shut.  </li>
      <li>It will allow safe carry of your favorite brush while providing great ventilation!</li>
      <li>Performs perfectly, just as advertised, exactly as needed.  </li>
      <li>My Vulfix 1016 Pure Badger Shaving Brush fits wonderfully in this shave brush travel holder.  </li>
      <li>Works great though, and should fit just about any sized brush.</li>
      <li>The two pieces that make up the holder screw together quite nicely.  </li>
      <li>Great product, plan to buy more to keep spare brushes stored safely.</li>
      <li>in my travel case nicely, and fits my brush nicely with an inch of room to spare for the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just a nice, well-crafted, bargain-priced, functional piece of equipment.</li>
      <li>However, for the price, it should be made of better material...even thicker plastic would be good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice way to bring your shaving brush with you without damaging the brush.</li>
      <li>Nice that it has a vent hole in case you have to pack up the brush while it is still damp.</li>
      <li>and you should be able to determine if you will have a good fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this one fits the bill nicely.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not fancy, but it does the job nicely.</li>
      <li>I particularly liked the design of the outer part of the holder which screws on very easily.</li>
      <li>The container is a bit larger in diameter than would be ideal, but it is still very nice.</li>
      <li>Fits my Simpson Classic 2 perfectly with about an inch to spare at the top.</li>
      <li>and I sure don&#x27;t want my nice brush to mold.</li>
      <li>Has a screw type mechanism to close the two halves - very secure.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you got it.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it threads together instead of clipping or shaping.  </li>
      <li>Great for travelling, doesn&#x27;t take up much room in your dopp kit but doesn&#x27;t squeeze the brush either.</li>
      <li>I guess I wish it was more custom-made for a shaving brush</li>
      <li>This item should not cost more than a couple of dollars.</li>
      <li>Totally satisfied.</li>
      <li>Ok, $10 for a chunk of plastic seems a bit steep, but it is a specialized item.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
      <li>Sure, you could buy a dedicated travel shave brush..</li>
      <li>It is sturdy and certainly better than storing the brush in a plastic bag for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Pop the brush in the bottom, and screw on the top - the brush continues drying because of the hold in the bottom, and does not come of out</li>
      <li>but I think this product does a better job than anything you can DIY.</li>
      <li>but this nifty Muhle device allows you to take your favorite shaving brush on the road.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no stop (until you get to the bottom), so I would be worried about crushing the bristles if they were at the top.</li>
      <li>The top and the bottom are threaded and fit together like a screw.</li>
      <li>and I really don&#x27;t need a pretty travel case for my cheap but great shaving brush I own.</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t find many alternatives to this product - whics is fine, because it works just fine.  </li>
      <li>This is one of those straight forward items that&#x27;s just what it appears to be ... a plastic cylinder that will store a shaving brush and keep it safe, clean and in good condition.</li>
      <li>My brush fits in the holder easily and the cap twists and stays.  </li>
      <li>I use a tweezerman badger brush and it easily fits in this travel holder.  </li>
      <li>It nice that I don&#x27;t have to find the custom holder for my exact brush that costs $30.  </li>
      <li>It fits my badger hair shaving brush just fine</li>
      <li>It was fine</li>
      <li>so it works fine.  </li>
      <li>and it fits fine.  </li>
      <li>Now that I&#x27;m becoming a more experienced wet shaver</li>
      <li>So, the tube works fine and it will fit almost any brush.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and it works well, simple in design, light weight and gets the job done!</li>
    <li> If you take your shave brush on travel with you, then you need this product.  It protects your brush, and also protects your bag from getting wet if your brush isn&#x27;t 100% dry.</li>
    <li> Nothing like a good old fashion shave and the brush is essential.  No need to leave this behind. It fits in my travel kit and keeps the brush protected.</li>
    <li> This worked great for me.  I purchased it in a hurry before heading to Ireland for a 2-week business trip.  I had converted to the \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; way of shaving last year but this was the first time I was going on a long trip.  It protected my shaving brush during travel very well.  The brush fit well.  There is a ventilation hole allowing air into the case for drying.  I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> This little device is so simple yet amazingly useful.  It is larger than it appears in the picture.  I travel a great deal and was tired of sacrificing a good shave when on the road.  When ou spend $30 or more for a nice brush you hate for it to be floating around in your kit.  This little device allows you to pack your brush in your kit and not worry about it.  It actually screws down to the exact size you need.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for when outfitting my Dopp Kit. It could be cheaper, but it is one-fifth the price of a decent travel shaving brush. It just happened to be a spur-of-the-moment purchase when I was checking out, but it was one well-made.</li>
    <li> Very practical and useful. A must if you are traveling with expensive silver tipped badger brushes. Or any brush you value.</li>
    <li> Not much to it but this nifty Muhle device allows you to take your favorite shaving brush on the road.  There really aren&#x27;t too many travel shaving brush options so why compromise just because you&#x27;re away from home?  Just don&#x27;t leave it behind in your hotel room.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice way to bring your shaving brush with you without damaging the brush. Makes for ease in traveling.</li>
    <li> This product was exactly what I needed. It keeps the standard shaving brush I have from getting all messed up in transit.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I needed to take a shaving brush on my honeymoon.  When I got it, it was bigger and better than I thought.  Thin, and light, but strong and sturdy.  It has a small hole in the bottom to allow some air circulation.  The best part is the COOL twisting way that it opens and closes and secures itself shut.  I would think this container would hold any standard size brush (just not the long handle ones).  My fiance and I spent the first 5 minutes we owned this product twisting it open and closed (a really neat engineering idea).  If you are looking for a brush holder, WELL worth the money, this is the one.  And it performed well on the honeymoon...  We are still married  ;-)</li>
    <li> This is well built and stands up to harsh packing. It wont collapse and screws on instead of snapping.  That way, it doesn&#x27;t accidentally pen or come off.  Great case.</li>
    <li> I have been using this travel tube for months and recommend it.  No issues.  Does the job. Unbreakable.</li>
    <li> It is a piece of plastic, but it functions as it should . It works with all my brushes with out issue. But, for what it is, it should be cheaper. That is my only complaint...the cost.</li>
    <li> I use a tweezerman badger brush and it easily fits in this travel holder.  It was great for my mini vacation.  It&#x27;s well engineered and should last for years.</li>
    <li> Lets me take my brush along when I travel. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it squishing the bristles, or the brush getting moldy or anything. It doesn&#x27;t really let it dry, but as long as you take it out when you get where you&#x27;re going, it shouldn&#x27;t be a huge issue.</li>
    <li> This is a great idea.  Simple but effective.</li>
    <li> Little plastic brush holder, not much to mess up here, really.  It screws together, it will get moldy if you leave a wet brush in there too long, you have to clean it after you take a trip.  Too simple to mess up, really.</li>
    <li> Stores my travel brush securely. It fits large brushes as well as smaller ones. Great product, plan to buy more to keep spare brushes stored safely.</li>
    <li> This sturdy plastic shaving brush holder is approximately 5\\&quot; tall when fully closed. Easily holds my Rooney 3/1 Super Badger brush with an inch to spare. Accommodates brushes 5-8\\&quot; tall by not screwing the top section down all the way. Inside dimension width is 1.5\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Looking at this holder, you&#x27;ll think to yourself why didn&#x27;t I think of that? Its so simple to use and the design is pretty ingenious. I use this to store my badger brush and like the hole at the bottom that allows it to breath a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the design is so simple (and no moving parts really) I am confident that the holder will last as long as my razor will (Which should be a VERY long time). I would have no hesitations to buy this again, even at the $10 price because its great for traveling to hold your brush.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly. Well designed, great for my Dopp Kit. Fits my Badger Brush ([[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]]) very well, and drains it through the hole in the base of the holder. Simple, effective.</li>
    <li> Bigger the expected but works well</li>
    <li> This is pretty nice and simple. The container is a bit larger in diameter than would be ideal, but it is still very nice.</li>
    <li> I would agree that it&#x27;s a bit expensive for what it is. Basically just a plastic tube.  I figure it&#x27;s cheaper than buying one of those travel brushes.  Works great though, and should fit just about any sized brush. The design is pretty clever the way it telescopes.  i&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a plastic tube with a lid that screws on and a hole to vent the brush if it&#x27;s still a bit wet when you put it away. This item should seriously only cost $1.00 not 10 times that amount! It does appear to be high quality plastic.</li>
    <li> I started to use a brush this year instead of the can of shaving cream I&#x27;ve used for years.  I was concerned for the brush when I travel, being buried in my shaving kit, I didn&#x27;t want to see it damaged.  The case worked great during a recent vacation, protected the brush as I wanted.  The hole in the bottom was perfect for drainage.</li>
    <li> Performs perfectly, just as advertised, exactly as needed.  I was also entertained by the unique way in which the 2 pieces of the container screwed together.  A nice feature that I expected to be overlooked was the inclusion of a small hole at one end to facilitate air-drying of the brush between uses.  Just a nice, well-crafted, bargain-priced, functional piece of equipment.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find anything locally that would do this for me, and this little tube is the perfect thing for brush-portability. Great for travelling, doesn&#x27;t take up much room in your dopp kit but doesn&#x27;t squeeze the brush either.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this was for full size brushes and not travel size brushes. It still works as expected but I wish the actual size was more apparent.</li>
    <li> This brush does the job and very well. Now that I&#x27;m becoming a more experienced wet shaver I think I&#x27;m going to upgrade to aSilver Badger brush, but this is a good entry level brush.</li>
    <li> This product is very simple, but it does the trick--worked great when traveling with the shave brush.  My only complaint was the sticker/label on the side of it.  The product itself works perfectly and fits nicely in the toiletries bag.  Nice that it has a vent hole in case you have to pack up the brush while it is still damp.</li>
    <li> Not much to say.  You won&#x27;t find many alternatives to this product - whics is fine, because it works just fine.  Keeps the brish contained during travel and easy to open close.  Will hold a very large brush if needed.  Currently, my [[ASIN:B002QHYYR0 Edwin Jagger 1ej946sds Traditional English Best Badger Hair Shaving Brush Faux Ebony Medium With Drip Stand, Black, Medium]] takes up about half the space.  Recommended for road warriors.</li>
    <li> Met my need perfectly.  Sturdy plastic with a drain hole on one end.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an easier way to travel with my shave brush.  My brush fits in the holder easily and the cap twists and stays.  It met my needs precisely.</li>
    <li> Mine is gray plastic. It holds my shaving brush perfectly. I only use this for travel. At home I keep my brush on a stand. It is sturdy and certainly better than storing the brush in a plastic bag for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dimensions given are accurate. Just measure your brush and you should be able to determine if you will have a good fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is rather expensive for what it is. It&#x27;s only a vacuum formed bit of plastic after all. Still, it does what is supposed to do and it should last a very long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen these types of cases before and I thought they would be really good for transporting brushes, I just didn&#x27;t know where to buy them. Lo and behold, you can get them on amazon! I would have given 5 stars, but the price seems a bit high for two pieces of plastic. Otherwise the case is very functional.</li>
    <li> great to protect your brush. Love it. The only thing is that I would not leave the brush inside for long periods after you shave.. Make sure you dry your brush before putting it inside the tube... If you don&#x27;t.. The brush will still be wet when you take it out of the tube. Overall is a life saver.</li>
    <li> Seems as if it will work -- we need something that my husband, who shaves with a brush and soap, needs for international travel. This seems as if it will do the job. I don&#x27;t know if the cap fits well or if it has the potential to leak, as we haven&#x27;t travelled with it yet.</li>
    <li> Great for travel!  I love the fact that it threads together instead of clipping or shaping.  Makes it so your brush has a double walled layer of protection from those oh so gentle TSA and airline employees...</li>
    <li> Great way to take your shave brush on the road and protect it.  Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot and this protects my brush very well.  I have to laugh though it is the same size and shape as a Hob cutter container.  So if you are in the gear manufacturing business go look for a Hob container and save a couple of bucks.</li>
    <li> Took a four day trip and the holder worked perfectly. The brush hair did not bend and splay apart. I particularly liked the design of the outer part of the holder which screws on very easily. Great design.</li>
    <li> if you travel, best case.</li>
    <li> Arrived ahead of schedule, and works very well.  Simple and has been traveling with me for weeks.  Happy with purchase and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have two!  I travel a lot and the use of these have saved the bristles of my brushes. Good.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t needed it yet, but I know my brush will be perfectly safe on my next vacation.</li>
    <li> This travel tube has the right concept but the implementation isn&#x27;t quite what I was after.  The tube is too large in diameter for a smaller brush, but will hold a full size brush just right.  I also had to drill several extra holes in the top and bottom to allow for better drying.</li>
    <li> Works great the design reminds me of one you get industrial carbide masonary bits in and it feels just as durable. Protect your investment with the best brush container I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> As the title suggests, JWIN. After switching to wet shaving 2 years ago, I refuse to use anything other than a DE razor, shave soap, and brush. When traveling, I generally used the soft plastic container, which is now falling apart, that the brush came in, so i decided to get something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is it. It has a hole in the bottom so the brush can breathe (or dry if packed when damp) and so water can drain out, if needed. The top and the bottom are threaded and fit together like a screw. The process goes easily and quickly, and is not laborious. This ensures the two pieces will not separate should it move around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fits in my travel case nicely, and fits my brush nicely with an inch of room to spare for the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple. Secure. Snug.</li>
    <li> This is a great and simple design that serves a single purpose!  As men, we all shave. Smart men wet shave. Knowing that, I also travel. What I don&#x27;t want to do when I travel is ruin an $80 shaving brush or damage it because I was too cheap to purchase a $15 travel tube designed to protect my silver-badger hair brush. Yes, it&#x27;s plastic. SO WHAT?  What do you expect it to be made out of? Stainless steel? Ivory? Hand-carved African mohogany?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s plastic. It works. Perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush fits nicely in the tube (I have several brushes and all fit) and it has a air-hole built in when it was molded in order to allow moisture to escape from a damp brush. If you travel and you use a shaving brush, this is money well-spent.</li>
    <li> My Vulfix 1016 Pure Badger Shaving Brush fits wonderfully in this shave brush travel holder.  The holder is large enough for my brush with a little extra room inside but small enough to fit nicely in my shaving kit travel case.    The holder is a sturdy little unit made of appropriately thick plastic.  The two pieces that make up the holder screw together quite nicely.  The holder has a hole in one end so that the brush can breathe while traveling.  This was especially helpful for me on my last trip:  the timing was such that I needed to shave right before packing up and heading to the airport.</li>
    <li> This travel holder is great for traveling. It has plenty of room for different sized brushes and is sturdy and light.</li>
    <li> So, the tube works fine and it will fit almost any brush.  I use it for my tweezerman and a real/full size badger brush. The thing has an odd phallic shape and its rather tall - I guess I expected something different.</li>
    <li> It is going to work well to protect the brush when traveling. However, for the price, it should be made of better material...even thicker plastic would be good. This item should not cost more than a couple of dollars.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but it&#x27;s basically just a plastic tube, so it&#x27;s hard to really go wrong.  I&#x27;m currently using a Colonel Conk Progress Model 1001 and it fits fine.  It&#x27;s pretty big, so I&#x27;d imagine that it would fit just about any brush out there.</li>
    <li> This travel holder does a great job of keeping your damp brush from getting other items in your shaving kit wet.  The design works well and can accept standard or even long handled brushes, due to the screw together 2 piece construction.  There is a small hole, at one end, to help allow the brush to air dry and not trap water.  I&#x27;m not sure this is the most effective design and if your brush were wet, the hole is large enough to drip out water, so make sure you dry it as best you can, before packing.  This is really for travel only and should not be used as a stand, when you are using the brush.  I would recommend picking up an inexpensive plastic stand, such as the &amp;#34;Badger Shaving Brush Drip Stand&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Recently purchased and used.  Wonderful, it protects both the brush and your kit.  Takes very little more space than a soggy brush would by itself.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as it should.</li>
    <li> This does a good job of storing and protecting your shave brush.  I got this to go with the gift of a new brush.  It is interesting the way it closes, it kind of cork-screws down, so it is adjustable.  This is perfect if you travel or have more than one brush and want to protect the one(s) you are not currently using.  I might have to get one for my brother, too.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to place the shaving brush in and has &amp;#34;vents&amp;#34; to allow brush to dry properly, I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This case is simple, sturdy enough, and does the job quite well.  It&#x27;s wide enough and more than long enough to hold any of my badger brushes even when fully closed, and on the off-chance you have an obscenely tall brush, you can twist this case partly closed and still reasonably expect it to hold its length.  For most brushes, the loft will get compressed a bit around its circumference, but this is generally not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case has a small hole on the end that ought to keep a damp brush from stewing in its own moisture.  I would still advise getting some small dessicant packs to tuck in the end, for the times you just can&#x27;t air-dry your brush before you hit the road.</li>
    <li> The picture of this container is deceiving.  The case is fairly large, and the top has notches on the entire side of it to screw into the lower half which has an air hole in it. It basically looks like an extra large pharmacy pill bottle.  It&#x27;s made out of very sturdy plastic. My [[ASIN:B002ESYH5K 100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Faux Petrified Wood Handle &amp; Free Brush Stand from Parker Safety Razor]] fits nicely inside the case with a little room to spare.  I think just about any brush would fit inside, aside from any much larger custom made brushes (doesn&#x27;t apply to most people) or a long handle brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that I can now travel in style with my daily shaving brush and not have to use a miniature travel brush that just wouldn&#x27;t do the same job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to Muhle Pinsel.  I thought to myself, who else would make such a nice brush holder considering the other shaving equipment they make.</li>
    <li> Now this is a good product and a good price.  Good idea.  Can fit any of my brushes.  Totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> This device is not wide enough to contain my Edwin Jagger brush.  I have recently ordered a new brush and am hoping that I will be able to use this travel holder for it in the future.</li>
    <li> Its a piece of cheap plastic that is super overpriced, however it gets the job done.  Just make sure you put the brush into the correct end, handle first, or else the bristles get stuck on the threading trying to get it out.  I broke a couple bristles off when I put it in the wrong way.  Perhaps a little printed picture of the way which the brush should go into and which piece it goes into may help?  Maybe even an index card with diagrams on it?  But they wont do that because this piece of plastic probably costed them like 13 cents and now they are charging 10 dollars.  Whatever, I couldnt find this tube anywhere else so it works fine.  I suppose I recommend this to others if you cannot find it elsewhere for much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Great travel brush holder. Would recommend to friends - does the job well. Has a screw type mechanism to close the two halves - very secure.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for the traveling businessman.  Keeps the brush clean and prevents bending or crushing of the bristles.</li>
    <li> This is one of those straight forward items that&#x27;s just what it appears to be ... a plastic cylinder that will store a shaving brush and keep it safe, clean and in good condition. It&#x27;s just simple to use and does what it should. If you travel and use a shaving brush you&#x27;ll want this to keep the brush in good shape on your trips.     A significant advantage for me is that I can use my brush in the morning, shake it out, dry it a bit with a towel and pack it wet without fear of damage or getting other items wet. There is sufficient air flow in the cylinder to allow the brush to dry while packed and it comes out dry and ready to use.    It&#x27;s not super cheap, but it&#x27;s worth it if you value your shaving brush. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It just does the job well.  It&#x27;s a bit pricy, but it can save an expensive brush, which can make it worth the price.</li>
    <li> Item is exactly what it says there&#x27;s no bells and whistles I guess I wish it was more custom-made for a shaving brush</li>
    <li> Yep this is a cheap little plastic holder but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do perfectly! It fits the standard size shaving brush (Parker models etc) with room to spare and is sturdy enough not to crush easily.</li>
    <li> This product is a bit bigger than I thought it would be, but it works well and keeps the brush nice.</li>
    <li> Great for traveling. It&#x27;s compact, but fits my brush.</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s a plastic tube that you can put your shave brush in- it works and the COL Conk fits in perfectly- not sure if the other types would or not.  Does exactly what you expect it to.  the two pieces screw together rather than slide so it won&#x27;t come open n the dopp kit.  Drain hole at one end helps to keep things fresh with the brush.  Doesn&#x27;t squish the bristles either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is a little high for what it is but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m reviewing so I won&#x27;t take stars off for the price.  Not sure what could be used in leu of this to do the same thing.  That&#x27;s why I paid the money.</li>
    <li> Some things you just have to have ...  The last time I traveled I used the cardboard roll fromT/P that didn&#x27;t work out so great .. This thing is nice and I can tell it will last forever.</li>
    <li> $10 for a drill bit container?  If you know someone that works at a machine shop, ask them to grab you one for 0 dollars. They ship drill bits and reamers in them and toss them in the bin. Way overpriced, for what it is.  I guess, you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re planning on doing any amount of traveling with a shaving brush - this is the holder for you!</li>
    <li> This item is identical to the container in which bars of polishing/buffing compounds are sold at hardware stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It even has the same threading system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy some polishing compound.  Use it up and then rinse out the container in a way that makes you feel happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bingo!  You just saved ten bucks.</li>
    <li> great. my husband loves it. it keeps the brush in good shape. great for travel. any guy would like it.</li>
    <li> Other than plastic, personal dislike, it is as advertised, does tend to catch some bristles when placeme</li>
    <li> ridiculous price for a piece of plastic would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a great little invention! Used it last week on a weekend trip. at first I was worried that my brush would get all moldy after 12 hours wet in a suitcase. It was fine there&#x27;s a hole at the brush end of the cylinder which lets out the moisture.</li>
    <li> This is grey plastic in the photo but the one I received was clear plastic. It fits my badger hair shaving brush just fine but it did seem a bit expensive for what it is.</li>
    <li> I primarily needed a travel container for my shaving brush.  this one fits the bill nicely.  It&#x27;s larger than my brush, but for the price, who cares?  It nice that I don&#x27;t have to find the custom holder for my exact brush that costs $30.  This one also has a hole in it which probably lets some moisture out, but I noticed that when my brush was inside, it was still damp the next day.  Not too bad and perfectly fine for travel.  Definitely sturdy enough to through in your suitcase.</li>
    <li> Bank for your buck. My medium size brush from art of shaving also fits in it. A good product  for travel .</li>
    <li> This is probably the best item in my travel kit. It will allow safe carry of your favorite brush while providing great ventilation!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not a lot high tech to this thing. It&#x27;s a plastic tube. It does screw down so it won&#x27;t pop open in your luggage and it does have a hole in it - which aids in drying when you have to put a wet brush in there. It seems I never have time in an airport to really get it dry and I sure don&#x27;t want my nice brush to mold. It does what you need - it protects your brush and a good brush is a serious investment. If you travel, you absolutely can&#x27;t go wrong with this travel case. You&#x27;ll be glad you got it.</li>
    <li> Not made of the most amazing material, but I could not find a similar product at a discount retailer.  Should fit most brushes, could use a bit more venting to allow a wet brush to dry out.</li>
    <li> Sure, you could buy a dedicated travel shave brush.. but if you&#x27;ve ever used on you know that it isn&#x27;t quite the same as using your large plush badger brush.  Instead of dropping $75 on a tiny brush, get a shave brush travel holder.  It&#x27;ll protect your brush bristles and allow you a great shave while on the road.  This is a MUST BUY for anyone that wet shaves.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it&#x27;s an overpriced piece of thin-walled plastic. Oh well. It protects the brush adequately and is easy to use. It is definitely on the big side though, primarily in length. There is a significant amount of length between the tip of my Parker brush and the end of the cap. This makes it a sizable addition to your toiletry bag. But, again, so what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just buy it and move on to the next item in your wish list.</li>
    <li> First off, it does its job of holding the brush for travel without damaging the hairs (as long as they are dry when stored). The unit I received was clear plastic and very cheap looking, not a solid color like the picture. I would think this is worth $2-3  at the most. It does have an interesting twist design to open and close it . All in all it does what it advertises - 3 stars for it being over-priced.</li>
    <li> We have not used this one yet, but I wanted it onhand when we hit the road.  So far it looks like it is durable.</li>
    <li> Solid construction. Fits my Simpson Classic 2 perfectly with about an inch to spare at the top. My Simpson Eagle G2 is too thick and does not fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube has a twist closure down the entire barrel, so you can fit taller brushes. There&#x27;s no stop (until you get to the bottom), so I would be worried about crushing the bristles if they were at the top. But you could probably tape the tube closed to prevent further closure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made of hard plastic; saw some people suggest drilling extra holes for ventilation... I may or may not do this.</li>
    <li> I bought this to keep my brush from getting damaged during trips, and it does it&#x27;s job very well. I use a basic [[ASIN:B000VUYG40 His Tweezerman Deluxe Shaving Brush]], and it fits with plenty of room to spare. There&#x27;s a whole in the bottom for drainage, and the case itself it very sturdy. The brush holds it&#x27;s shape well, and doesn&#x27;t lose bristle during travel.</li>
    <li> I noticed another reviewer complaining about this product being flimsy and overpriced. The first claim is patently false, and the second is perceptual. I completely disagree with both viewpoints. The Pinsel holder is made of sturdy plastic designed by a thoughtful engineer. It protects my expensive badger brush very well. Pop the brush in the bottom, and screw on the top - the brush continues drying because of the hold in the bottom, and does not come of out my hygiene kit malformed. There is no way the holder will come apart during travel - I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase and would buy again if necessary, although I suspect the holder will outlast me.</li>
    <li> Great idea if you plan on taking your badger brush/wet shaving products on the road. Better to have your brush in this than have it loosely packed in a travel shaving case.</li>
    <li> It is a functional brush holder that does extend to an excellent length. Really will fit most shave brushes, even long handled ones. It is not as premium as it looks in the photo. Which was definitely disappointing. Given the quality, it is not worth the price, but it is still useful, so I will not be returning it.</li>
    <li> It is a super simple idea and required if you are going to travel with your shave kit. If you are wondering if this is a good idea or not, believe me its a great solution to a common problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen solutions you can make yourself but I think this product does a better job than anything you can DIY.</li>
    <li> I do not own this product I am reviewing it merely based on materials/cost.  I was about to hit the Add to cart button and decided to look for alternatives and someone suggested a plastic pill bottle.  I went to the drug store and all it cost me was sad puppy eyes and the lady gave me a bottle free of cost.  I am not poor I am just frugal and will save money any time I can.  Besides this goes into my Gym bag and I really don&#x27;t need a pretty travel case for my cheap but great shaving brush I own.</li>
    <li> This is a neat little tube, quite large actually and should fit all but the hugest of shaving brushes.  But, you can get this for just $6.50 on a very popular shaving products site.</li>
    <li> Ok, $10 for a chunk of plastic seems a bit steep, but it is a specialized item.  At least the plastic is firm and sturdy and the item itself works great.  One piece screws onto the other for a tight perfect fit that holds the brush safely in my bag.</li>
    <li> Well designed and holds the shave brush perfectly with very little room for it to move around, thus keeping the bristles intact.  Small and compact - excellent for travel and carry on.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, simple, secure way to transport your favorite shaving brush while traveling.  It&#x27;s big enough for my Parker brush and then some.  There&#x27;s a drain/vent hole one one end to keep moisture from building up.  It&#x27;s not fancy, but it does the job nicely.</li>
    <li> It fits my standard badger hair brush well with a little extra room at the end to accommodate bigger brushes. It doesn&#x27;t come unscrewed, even with excessive jostling. It has a hole at the end to allow a little air movement/evaporation from your brush if it&#x27;s not completely dry.d</li>
    <li> Flimsy plastic construction with no thought of quality.</li>
    <li> Great product! Perfect for a traveler!</li>
    <li> For all you guys getting back in touch with DE shaving and want a good carrier to keep your shave brush in, this is it. I&#x27;ve used it for multiple business trips around the country, vacations, and weekend getaways. It keeps the brush from getting crushed in your luggage or Dopp kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;ll say is that you should let it air out every now and again, otherwise your brush will start smelling dingy. Don&#x27;t leave it in here wet for more than a day!</li>
    <li> Works perfect for all my brushes when I travel which I do 9 months a year. The only thing is it is kinda pricey for what it is.</li>
    <li> My husband has just started to shave with a de and was wondering how he was going to travel with his brush without messing up the bristles.  I bought him this figuring it was worth trying out for the price.  His brush fit perfectly and he loved it.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> More than ten weeks use and love it.  For a long time I did not use anything to hold my brush.  I am happy I now have this brush holder.  It is light weight, sturdy, fits together well.  It is my first so I can not compare with others.  Simply put, I like it for traveling.</li>
