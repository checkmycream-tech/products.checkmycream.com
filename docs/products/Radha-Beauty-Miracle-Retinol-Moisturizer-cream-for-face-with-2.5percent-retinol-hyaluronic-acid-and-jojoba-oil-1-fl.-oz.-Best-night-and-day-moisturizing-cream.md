<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Skin felt smooth and looked better immediately!</li>
    <li> Edit: After receiving a faulty package and leaving the initial review below, I got a call from Radha Beauty asking me about my experience with the packaging. A few days later, there was a new package of the moisturizer in the mail for me, and it works just like it should! The cream is not too thick, has a subtle, pleasant smell, and helped ease the redness of my face without feeling greasy. Mostly, though, I am impressed by the quality of the customer service––never before has a company gone out of their way to make me feel like my opinions and experiences are valued. The representative said &amp;#34;if you aren&#x27;t happy, we aren&#x27;t happy,&amp;#34; and I do believe she meant it. If you purchase any of Radha&#x27;s products and something goes wrong, please let them know, because they are indeed helpful. Original Post: After purchasing other products from Radha and being satisfied, I opted to buy this moisturizer. I have been experiencing much difficulty even getting the cream out of the bottle––I have to hit it or shake it several times for even a small amount to come out. While I&#x27;m sure it is a quality product, I can&#x27;t  use it well due to packaging issues.</li>
    <li> Retinol Moisturizer from Rhada Beauty is wonderful.Great texture ,very soft and light refreshing smell.Love that it left my skin soft all day and throughout the night.Very refreshing.Would reccomend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> This works so nice, feels soft and I am beginning to see improvement after 4 weeks. love this.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It makes your face so soft and it has the perfect consistency and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy at all!</li>
    <li> I love this for under my eye area for extra hydration throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free for review purposes but that does not influence my decision. My opinion is 100% mine and honest.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, absorbs well but as with the Radha eye serum no noticeable difference with use.  No SPF and has retinol so if I&#x27;m going to bike or hike in a few hours I use a different lotion,  otherwise, the smell is nice and it goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a temporary fix but I like it.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Gives my skin such a radiant glow and for this price, it&#x27;s a win-win! Def worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> I am so excited for this product. I have been using it for about 3 weeks and I love how my skin feels; it leaves my skin looking silky.  But, what I like more about this product is that it has 71% organic; it contains all the great products for our skin. It has natural ingredients such as Organic Aloe, Green Tea, Jojoba oil, Shea Butter for healthy skin. I am going to keep using it over and over. Thanks Radha!</li>
    <li> Works OK as a moisturizer but definitely does not have 2.5% retinol.  I&#x27;ve used 1% retinol products that work better.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference and have been using this retinal religiously night and days.  I&#x27;m pretty bummed bc I thought this would help a little with fine lines and lifting.  I&#x27;m 47 and also use sunscreen always!  Honestly I feel like I&#x27;m putting nothing on my face and don&#x27;t feel the tingling others described.</li>
    <li> My new favorite moisturizer. The ingredients are fantastic. When I put it on, it makes me skin appear softer, almost airbrushed. The dispenser is SMART- no dipping your fingers and no air exposure keeping the integrity of the product safe. I definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> The bottle was bigger than expected and I&#x27;ve been using for 4 days - my skin is smooth and clear and I love how it feels with this moisturizer!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  I have had it for less than a week and i can already tell a difference in my skin tone and the pores are smaller.  I will be ordering this product again and again.  I want my friends and family to know about it too.  Thanks for such a great product.</li>
    <li> I love this cream! I have extremely sensitive skin and I haven&#x27;t had any issues. I love the price just as much as the product. I will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> Love it! My pores are less noticeable.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is super light weight and effective. I have oily/combination skin and this worked amazingly. A little pump goes a long way, and the bottle you receive is huge! Definitely will last me months -- a great value for $25! Left my skin smoother, brighter, and looking amazing. Also works well under makeup! Definitely a must-try.</li>
    <li> These products are filled with natural, organic ingredients that your skin will love.  I tested these products as a three-step system. My first step, after washing my face, is to apply the Eye Gel.  The 0.5 fl oz bottle might not seem like much, but a little goes a long way so I am confident it will last a long time.  I use about half a pump for both eyes and still have some leftover on my fingers to dab across my forehead.  Be sure to dab around your eyes, so as not to stretch your delicate skin.  Radha Beauty Eye Gel has a light, crisp, cucumber scent that just might be my very favorite scent (I forgot how much I love the smell of cucumber)!  The gel is thick and spreads easily, but also absorbs very quickly and can be used underneath makeup.  The gel feels incredibly cooling and fresh as I dab it on my eyes.  Like I said, I also put this on my forehead but it can be used as an allover facial treatment for enhanced glow radiance.  I cannot clinically say this has changed my fine lines and wrinkles but it feels great on my face and I sure that it helps with my puffy morning eyes (I have puffy morning eyes).  The cooling gel is a great way to start my early early mornings.  After the eye gel I apply the Vitamin C Serum all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Radha Beauty Vitamin C Serum is a thin, runny serum that I was not certain I would like but it soaks right into my skin and does not feel greasy.  It is specially formulated to stimulate collagen production and renew aging skin to a more youthful appearance.  It has virtually no scent at all and just like the eye gel, a little goes a long way.  Start with 1 pump as it spreads very easily.  I like this serum and I think it has already begun to improve my skin tone.  I will provide more information on this product in the future, after I have used it for several weeks. On a side note, I love the packaging. The final step?  After the Vitamin C Serum has FULLY soaked into the skin and dried (it only takes a few seconds) itis important to apply a rich moisturizer.  Enter the Miracle Retinol Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great piece of packaging, this Retinol Moisturizer comes in a tall, sleek, silver bottle with a fancy little pump.  But let&#x27;s be real, what matters is the product.  I have been in love with Retinol Moisturizers for most of my adult life (I swear by them, in fact) and this one does not disappoint.  This serum is formulated with 2.5% Retinol Complex that provides both immediate and long-term release to promote radiant skin.  The Retinol increases cell turnover rate to give you newer, brighter skin.  It is a thick and creamy moisturizer that makes for a great final step in the three-step process.  I love that it is 71% organic with natural ingredients such as Organic Aloe, Green Tea, Jojoba Oil, and Shea Butter.  So moisturizing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I am a satisfied customer with these products.  The best part is that if you are not satisfied with your purchase, you can get 100% of your money back, without even returning the bottle. The customer service is incredible.</li>
    <li> I have used other retinol creams in the past that were pricey.  I didn&#x27;t care for the film left on my face.  I love this retinol cream.  It absorbs quickly into my face and neck.  Again, Radha Beauty does not disappoint.</li>
    <li> I really like the product. It would be really nice if I could get it out! The pump does not work well.</li>
    <li> This is one of my all time favorite moisturizers!! I am not even kidding when I say this, but it made my face feel like a babies butt! I use this in the morning and at night. Some mornings I did not use it, though. I noticed my face started looking younger after about 1 week or so. But even the first time I used it, I noticed other things like how soft it made my face feel. I highly recommend this moisturizer!! I did receive a free sample of this for testing purposes. For a more in-depth review, check out my blog post: http://www.gorgeousandstuff.com/2015/02/radha-beauty-review.html</li>
    <li> I been trying out this product with intensive youth eye gel and vitamin c serum... this is the best face moisturizer i have ever tried on my face it smooths my skin and gives it a refreshing touch and also evens out skin tone. it removed red bumps that i had on my face i can touch my face and it feels so smooth deff will keep using this product together with the other product i got with this moisterizer.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping,extremely curtious customer service! I have Tzone and very sensitive skin. This did not leave my skin oily,I could feel it working,but not harsh. Left a matte,hydrated skin that I could put my foundation over. Extremely pleased!</li>
    <li> This cream is the best cream I ever tried. My skin changed for the best.&lt;br /&gt;The costumer service was very helpful with me and very kind.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer goes on very nicely and is not the least bit greasy, absorbs completely and quickly (my skin drinks it in). Honestly, this Retinol cream has definitely exceeded my expectations, get some! Added bonus, the packaging is very attractive.</li>
    <li> This worked fine, but the size of the bottle is very deceiving. It&#x27;s a large bottle with only 1oz in it. It looks big, but beware of the amount of product you are getting!</li>
    <li> Worked great along with vitamin c serum to reduce my dark spots on my face thT have so incredibly hard to lighten</li>
    <li> Works great! Absorbs quickly and not greasy. Helped my complexion...</li>
    <li> i imagine as with anything you have to use long time to see results, the company seems nice and have sent several lovely emails but i just see no moisture being imparted to my skin so went back to previous cream. bought mostly for the retinol but my skin is aging without the moisturization.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough.</li>
    <li> I have a really hard time finding a moisturizer that does not break my skin out.  Having really sensitive skin can sometimes be a pain.  Radha&#x27;s Retinol Moisturizer does anything but break me out.  I can see improvement in my skin within the first week of use.  Many of the fine lines in my face seem to be fading a bit and the density and elasticity seems to be improving.  Also, the minor blemishes that I had are now fading just a tad.  Most of all, I am able to retain a great moisture level in my skin.  This is a true miracle product.  The greatest miracle of all is that it does not cause my skin to have an eczema break out.  Best of all you are getting the best of the best with a Radha product.  The biggest perk being that the product is Vegan.....</li>
    <li> really smooth and creamy; ive found past retinol creams to be a bit sticky &amp; harsh-I love this product!! I&#x27;m a Floridian and using any retinol product during the day  would make my skin react;  breakouts, rashes and bumps.So ive been using it every night to moisturize my skin without any adverse reactions! I LOVE IT!!! Thanks again for a wonderful product!!</li>
    <li> My daughter let me borrow her cream for a week.  Another Radha product I am sold on.  Normally, I cannot use products with Retinol, as they cause redness and over dryness.  This cream is fantastic!! And, in just one week I noticed a difference in my skin tone, texture and a softening in the lines around my mouth.  Gave my daughter her cream back and bought my own!!  Radha, keep up the great work!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this moisturizer!!! :-)  I&#x27;ve only been using it a week and I can definitely see the difference.  My skin is firmer and clearer.  Will recommend to EVERYONE! :-)</li>
    <li> Only used a few days but my face seems firmer.</li>
    <li> This moisturizing cream feels like Silk when it glides over your face and neck, with no pull. It&#x27;s absorbs quickly into the skin. This product is scent free, which I love.  I have been using with the vitamin C serum and the results are wonderful. My skin is so soft, blemish free and dark spots are fading daily. The larger size is nice and great for your budget. I would recommend this product used with eye gel and Vitamin C serum if you want to look and feel your best.</li>
    <li> doesnt work for my skin.</li>
    <li> I just hope I could return the product and get my money back. Intried using chemical free facial products as I have a very sensitive skin, thought this one would help, but it didn&#x27;t have a good result for me at all. I used this for 2 weeks only because my breakouts and blemishes got worst. Good product though!</li>
    <li> I see a difference in my face lines</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! The first one that arrived had a defective pump that stopped working after 2 squirts. I contacted the company on Saturday and had a new one on Monday. Excellent customer service!</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer! I use it every night, followed with the skingenixx retinol cream [[ASIN:B00VSEINZQ Skingenixx Collagen Retinol Anti-Aging Cream]] (which is also amazing), and my skin has never looked better!</li>
    <li> This cream is great  it smooth my face and reduced appearance of my dark spots, I only use it for couple days, and  the costumer services were awesome.</li>
    <li> Works great! Now a part of my daily skin care regimen!</li>
    <li> This is really good to keep your skin smooth and nice. It&#x27;s very light as well, so my makeup easily goes smoothly on top.</li>
    <li> To be honest I did not find a big difference with this it&#x27;s just not something I felt that worked we&#x27;ll. Sorry</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;I believe it helped minimize my forhead lines. Far from a miracle cream but definitely a nice moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Just noticed dry skin and  little lines by my eyes n neck.  Started applying this with serum. Now I can&#x27;t find them!&lt;br /&gt;Product is light not greasy.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any dramatic improvement.</li>
    <li> I was about to put one star less is because I ran out ot it a bit faster than I expected and I´m gutted....I have used concentrated retinol and this doesn´t feel like 2.5%, YET the skin looks positively glowing, moisturized from day one, had some peeling the first 3 days and the smell is definitely retinol but I believe because of the compound it is not the most assimilable retinol. Yet for the price it´s a bargain, I live in Europe and don´t find this in Amazon Europe and I´m gutted, this cream has definitely made an immpact in how my skin looks (I´m a makeup artist and have been a cosmetics model for Astor etc...so my skin is already one of my biggest assets and people usually make comments on it) after only 1 week of using this cream even people who know me with no makeup asked me if I had done botox or a peeling, this cream is a KEEPER. And you can read my other reviews and see how I tear apart products that don´t deserve the hype.....this one does... if only it lasted a bit longer :)</li>
    <li> The product arrived before the expected delivery date and when I opened the box, no wonder it was an awesome product infront of me.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:5 star&lt;br /&gt;User friendly:5 star&lt;br /&gt;Performance:5 star&lt;br /&gt;Bit excited to use the other products from Radha Beauty.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful work Radha Beauty and Team.</li>
    <li> Awesome -- I see a big difference in my pores and wrinkles after only a month of use.  I try to do it at least once a day.  Huge difference.  I use it with the C Serum.</li>
    <li> When I first applied this moisturizer I was so excited that it didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily, and I love the light feeling it leaves on my face.  My skin seems to be tighter just using it for 2 weeks now.  There is no odor that would irritate a person with MCS.  The pump is fantastic, it doesn&#x27;t clog, your hands don&#x27;t get messy trying to apply the cream, and it scoots out just the right amount.  A little bit of the moisturizer goes a long way!  When this tube runs out,  I will definitely purchase the product again!</li>
    <li> The texture of my skin became rough to the touch.</li>
    <li> First off, let me say that I am a HUGE beauty junkie and have tried so many different brands of beauty products. I am very blunt and very honest when it comes to my reviews:&lt;br /&gt;With that said, This is one of the most incredible products from Radha Beauty yet!! I&#x27;m already a HUGE fan of this brand, because every product I&#x27;ve tried is very effective and made of top quality ingredients. The customer service is exceptional as well!! Specifically regarding the&lt;br /&gt;Retinol Moisturizing cream with 2.5% Retinol, you will be SO impressed! The moment you open the package, you will immediately feel as if you have just been sent a $200 bottle of luxury cream that you find in celebrities home. The packaging is very impressive. However, the product inside the beautiful packaging is what will keep me going back for more. My skin immediately felt smoother. The texture of the cream is perfect, for all skin types. It absorbs into your skin very fast! I use it every morning before makeup application and every night after makeup removal as well. I have been using it for several weeks now, and I can already see a difference in my skin. This crazy winter weather has had my my skin very dry, but Radha Beauty has came to the rescue and revitalized and moisturized my skin giving me a fresh, glowing complexion. Thank you Radha Beauty!!!</li>
    <li> Hands down one of my favorite face products. I received the product for free and have received other products from this brand for free. As a whole I have enjoyed all of their products. But this product is AMAZING! It plumps up my skin and keeps it moisturized during this harsh winter weather. I have extremely sensitive skin and have not had a reaction to this product. When I have tried other retinol products my skin starts to burn and becomes inflamed. Thankfully, I haven&#x27;t had that issue at all! I love that it is a pump bottle because the product stays fresher longer. I am still in my twenties and do not have any deep wrinkles, but again it does plump up my dry skin. I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!! I will be puchasing it. I recommended it to my friends, and think it&#x27;s absolutely worth a try.</li>
    <li> If you want an effective Retinol A. Try this! It makes my skin a little tight but really it reduces the fine lines on my forehead.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Feels so good going on.  Instantly feels like it is working.  I love all their products!  I am using it twice a day and totally love it!!  Will always use this product.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I use skinceuticals 1% retinol which I like.  It is pure retin A. I thought this was stronger but it is not. there are 22 ingredients in this cream. retinol is number 6, green tea 9  and vitamin E 16. I have been using this for about a week and i have developed 3 pimples!  My pores look big and clogged.&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to my skinceuticals product.  I never had this problem.</li>
    <li> I have &amp;#34;difficult&amp;#34; skin - sometimes dry patches, sometimes too oily, sensitive to random things, hormonal acne... the works.  I&#x27;m at an age when I get to worry about both pimples and wrinkles.  I was looking for something with enough Retinol in it to help fade the marks from old blemishes and delay the inevitable lines. This moisturizer, which I primarily use at night, has made a tremendous difference in just a couple of months - smoother skin, no breakouts, soft without being greasy, and no irritation.  I can see this becoming my year-round moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Trying new skin care products is always a jump for me.  I am always worried about my skin reacting badly, or drying out even more.  This serum is all natural and doesn&#x27;t have any harsh chemicals or pore clogging parabens.  I usually put the lotion on my neck and face and rub the excess into my hands.  It feels soothing when applied.  My dry skin soaks it right up, leaving me feeling refreshed in the morning.  I am noticing that my pores are reducing, lessening the dirt that tends to clog them up.  I really like this serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Moisturizer received for testing.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of face creams out there, but I have to say, this one is really nice. The top is flat and the cream comes out the front, which is aesthetically pleasing and easy to get out of the bottle. Right away my skin feels like it&#x27;s softer and hydrated, the circles under my eyes seem like they are lighter, and my skin looks healthier. My husband even mentioned it to me. I gave some to my mother for her to try and she says that her fine lines and wrinkles near her eyes look better already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN</li>
    <li> I ordered this product, liked it and the pump stopped working.  I was not happy.  However, this company went out of their way to make me happy!!!!  They contacted me and said they would send out a new bottle immediately.  They kept in constant  contact and had fabulous customer service.  True to their word, I received the new bottle at super speed...complete with a working pump.  If the moisturizer works as good as their customer service is, I will be super happy.  As far as the product, I like the consistency.  Very creamy but light.  Not sure if it will do anything for my wrinkles yet, but my skin appears smoother and is very soft.  Will have to update when I have used the product for awhile.  However, I was super impressed with the company and how they handled my situation.  Will definitely try their other products.</li>
    <li> Did not meet my expectations.i was hoping it will lighten up my face after more than three weeks of using it...</li>
    <li> I just started using this product, but it contains&lt;br /&gt;more amount of the ingredients of another cream&lt;br /&gt;that I have that have given me a very good results.</li>
    <li> I just received my moisturizer and have used a couple of days. And love it so far. Thanks Radha!!!!</li>
    <li> Not worth it.  Limited amount in container.  Did not smooth skin at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for almost a month and I&#x27;m really surprised (and happy) I haven&#x27;t broken out in spots. The skin on my 42 yr old face feels lovely, supple, smoother, and fresh. I&#x27;ve even left the house without make-up on. If my skin continues to look this great, I&#x27;ll be back for more. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Lovely product.. with 2.5% of active retinol, vitamin E and green tea. Absorbs quickly leaving skin feeling soft, supple and happy.  Lots of organic ingredients and helps with the appearance of lines, wrinkles and pores. It works. I was given a free sample of this product for an honest and fair review. I will buy this product in the future as needed. I like this in my arsenal of healing and nourishing skin products.</li>
    <li> i used it. it is very good product but too expensive. i have to look for a less expensive one</li>
    <li> What i LOVE most about Rahda moisturizer is the supports it gives for my face needs to improve skin texture and tone. I got large pores, to let anyone knows having a large pores is prone to blackheads and whiteheads. Dirt easily stuck on my skin so i need to deep cleaning it with facial wash everyday, facial scrub twice a week so avoid break outs. large pores also makes my skin oily that&#x27;s why i am using toner and serum to help minimize. I received Rahda Skincare Retinol Moisturizer on a discount price in exchange of my unbiased and honest own opinion after test reviews. As per few weeks using Moisturizer, my pores are minimize not a big change but its a start, i didn&#x27;t get any rashes or any redness nor discoloration that leads to itchiness. my skin is very sensitive it reacts on harsh ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended to try. Please noted too that i am using a facial wash, toner, serum because i am no longer a teen and moisturizer also taking vitamins.</li>
    <li> Very good product but not effective as it should be.</li>
    <li> Radah Beauty has a 100% natural product line along with many fantastic oils -- Which is what attracted me to their line in the first place. I love the fact that they have Eco-friendly packaging, and do not test on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m head over heels about this serum. I&#x27;ve been using the Clearing Serum for a few weeks now, and I have to say I&#x27;m very pleased! It&#x27;s very lightweight, which is perfect for my oily skin. And I know a lot of people have said that they don&#x27;t like the smell of this serum, but I rather like it. It reminds me of tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer.  I can feel the firming action of my skin as soon as it gets absorbed.  I also love the smell.</li>
    <li> I have not seen a difference and have been using this for 2 weeks. Will keep trying it until gone . If any improvement will review again,</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!  Great packaging, fast service.  Makes my skin feel wonderful!</li>
    <li> This lotion is so light you can&#x27;t even tell you have it on!  The scent is very refreshing. Product provided free in return for unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I just received it, but already am loving it! It takes a very small amount to rub on your face and it feels smooth and creamy. I usually rub it in a circular motions until I don&#x27;t feel it on my fingers. So far, I have nothing bad to say about it. I will have to wait though to see results and how my skin looks, but usually I can tell right away. I have tried several many different products and this one is by far the best.</li>
    <li> I am always so pleasantly surprised with Radha&#x27;s products - and it encourages me to continue to invest in the line. My skin is very sensitive and I am very pleased with the formula. It is quickly absorbes, non-greasy, and very clean feeling - not stickiness or tightness. My favorite thing about Radha is its choice in ingredients - the list is clean, short, concise. Well crafted. I&#x27;ll be back for more! Loving the results so far.</li>
    <li> Love it Thank You. Works great</li>
    <li> This product leaves your skin feeling nourished without really feeling like you just put something on your face. I&#x27;d also like to say that Radha Beauty has really impressed me with their customer service, so if you aren&#x27;t satisfied with their products, tell them! They truly just want to make their customers happy.</li>
    <li> Sometimes I feel like I&#x27;m way to busy to sit down and write a review on a product (although I also depend on them when ordering things I&#x27;m not familiar with) but this product as well as the eye gel are so fabulous, I can&#x27;t wait to tell you how much I love them!! I have a scar (years old) under my left eye and literally within 48 hours of using this product along with the eye gel, it has plumped my scar tissue up to where you can hardly see the scar!!  I actually like these products better than Meaningful Beauty products and that&#x27;s saying a lot!! Buy it! You&#x27;ll LOVE it!!</li>
    <li> My wife can see absolutely no reduction in her wrinkles.  Not reduced one iota! Also, you can not see in the bottle to know when it is getting low. It certainly is not a miracle, but she said it is a nice feeling lotion.  However it is expensive for a moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Have wrinkles on my neck and this has smoothed out. pretty happy with results.</li>
    <li> I think the is my favorite retinol moisturizer that I have tried.  It is thick like most retinol moisturizers but, it absorbs right into my skin and just leaves my skin soft not greasy.  I only use retinol products at night but, this one is great and I recommend trying it for any skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample Provided by Radha</li>
    <li> Using this moisturizer before bed seems to suit my skin perfectly.  It is part of my skin care routine daily.  The Retinol seems to help clear my skin and all the products work together beautifully.  Radha has produced a line of products that work, and work well.  I have never been big on skin care and my skin has suffered.  A coupon for a sample of the product had induced me to try it, and now I know how well it works, I use daily.  I have oily skin and these products have never caused any problems with my skin.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer. It makes my skin feel so soft. I have a hard time finding moisturizers that do not make my face break out. I have found it in this one. My face does not break out with this. It makes my skin look younger.</li>
    <li> Product does not match description- all all.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients not as advertised</li>
    <li> The first container I bought would not dispense any moisturizer! Though it was past the Amazon return window Radha promptly shipped me a new container, free of charge. I have been using the product for about a week and it seems to keep my skin hydrated without being too thick.</li>
    <li> Radha sends you emails updating the status of your order and also sends you a &amp;#34;How to use&amp;#34; your Vitamin C serum. I&#x27;ve been using this line of products for over two weeks and I do believe my face looks smoother and more healthy. You may see many reviewers got the product free to review it but I bought these products. I have to say this order is my second and I plan on sticking with this line. Happy customer here!</li>
    <li> So far, so good! Makes my skin hydrated and feel nice</li>
    <li> I liked it at first, but now I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s breaking my skin out. I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements either. I&#x27;m back on Alpha Hydrox Retinol Res-Q. It&#x27;s much better for me.</li>
    <li> I use this moisturizer over the vitamin C serum after the serum has dried. The retinol moisturizer is strong enough to see results,  but it does not cause my skin to turn red or have dry patches like some retinol products do. My mineral makeup goes on perfectly after this.</li>
    <li> I bought this product when it was on sale and figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I love it! My skin looks great and it&#x27;s not sticky/shiny like some moisturizers can leave your skin.</li>
    <li> I had been meaning to try retinol products for a while and was happy to be able to test a sample of this from Radha Beauty. The trick is to use slightly less than a normal version of the product (non retinol) as it can be drying, especially for sensitive skin. Doing this was fine for this product- it still provided a nice amount of moisture and I haven&#x27;t had any issues (I dont wear it every day though, so can&#x27;t comment on that - probably 3-4 times a week.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see a nice effect when using this - it definitely feels like it&#x27;s &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; more than a regular moisturizer - while you aren&#x27;t going to remove years of spots/wrinkles etc it is definitely a nice boost in keeping things smooth and a bit more youthful. I suspect after a few more months I will see some addiitional improvement - again you aren&#x27;t going to lose a decade with any one product but I think Retinol is definitely more noticeable than most other anti aging ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main reason this gets points from me is because it&#x27;s natural - not filled with junk, and as you&#x27;re putting it on your face this is a big deal. Green Tea and Vitamin E are so much better than long chemicals you can&#x27;t pronounce :) It FEELS clean, and light - both huge bonuses as not all creams/lotions meant for your face do and you can kind of feel it throughout the day. The only thing I would love added is an SPF but it&#x27;s not often you get everything in one product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely priced at a little over $20 - definitely steps up from the drugstore brands and worth a few extra bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve attached a picture of the bottle - easy to use and while you can&#x27;t see the level, you can easily tell when it&#x27;s getting to the end by weight, and just have a replacement handy. Thanks Radha for the chance to test this!</li>
    <li> I like the feel as I apply and a little can go miles. It settles nicely</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous moisturizer over the years, but this one is my new favorite. It goes on smoothly without feeling greasy or waxy, a very light scent, and leaves my skin very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Many products out there have problems with their delivery system - either too much, have to pump several times to get the product out, or the pump just wont work at all - but the pump on this worked fine, Howver, I have noticed that as the amount in the container has decreeased, I have had to pump a little more. I think this just has to due with decreaed volume in the container, not a failure of the pump mechanism.</li>
    <li> Very nice creamy moisturizer..I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference but I am hoping to get the results some others have.Great seller!!!</li>
    <li> I received another bottle and this one was fine thanks Radha!!</li>
    <li> This is the most AMAZING Product out there!...my skin has never felt or looked this good, ever!</li>
    <li> Great cream, really made my skin glow</li>
    <li> Here is the claim: This concentrated serum is formulated with a 2.5% Retinol Complex that provides both immediate and long term release to promote radiant skin. It supports natural cell turnover to improve skin texture and tone. The appearance of lines, wrinkles, and enlarged pores is softened, revealing new skin with a youthful glow.  I have not experienced the apparent softening of lines, wrinkles, and enlarged pores after using the product as per the instructions for 3 weeks.  Unfortunately, a time line is not given when to expect results, but in my experience, it is usually longer than 3 weeks.   The product feels luxurious to the touch and very nice on the skin without being heavy. The lack of fragrance is PERFECT.  It does leave my skin soft and smooth feeling and not as tight, however the &#x27;glow&#x27; factor is absent for this, over 40, customer.  I have pretty dry skin so an added moisturizer is a must for me.  I cannot verify it is organic or all natural however, I think it&#x27;s great that the company endorses using UV protection with this product. A review was requested in my receiving this product at no charge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my dark circles  have diminished,  I still have them bit way less noticeable. Only have been using this for a little over a month now.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for about 2 weeks now, and I do like the product. It&#x27;s not a cure-all, but it&#x27;s a nice feeling lotion/moisturizer that helps with fading pigmentation problems. It is not a heavy lotion, yet moisturizes your skin very well. Would I recommend it to a friend? Sure, if they are looking for a retinol moisturizer cream, I think Radha Beauty Product is the way to go. Great customer service, great communication, and best of all, great product. I will continue using this product, and will update this review after 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Miracle Retinol Moisturizer by Radha Beauty for three weeks and I&#x27;m impressed with the results. I&#x27;ve been using Radha Beauty&#x27;s Intensive Youth Eye Gel in conjunction with their Retinol Moisturizer and Vitamin C Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ultimate question is does it work? After only a week I started noticing something unexpected, my acne scars were starting to vanish, not all of them but enough to notice. I have had acne scar patches on both temples for several years. Nothing has worked at reducing them. I&#x27;ve been documenting the results so others could see for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the attached photo I&#x27;ve compared the before photo, week one, and week three side by side. As you can see there is a significant reduction in the visibility of my acne scars after using Radha&#x27;s Beauty line of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness Ratings:&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing: *****&lt;br /&gt;Dark Circle Correction: Not observed&lt;br /&gt;Fine Line and Wrinkle Correction: *****&lt;br /&gt;Acne Scar Correction: *****&lt;br /&gt;Puffiness Reduction: *****&lt;br /&gt;Improved Texture and Tone: ****&lt;br /&gt;Pore Reduction: Not observed&lt;br /&gt;Overall rating: *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: No adverse reactions, didn’t cause acne breakouts, didn’t cause redness or any irritation, and exceeded my expectations at repairing damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: In three weeks it didn&#x27;t help my dark circles or reduce the enlarged pores on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received Radha Beauty&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum, Intensive Youth Eye Gel, and Retinol Moisturizer complimentary for testing purposes. I&#x27;m not required to post a favorable review and all opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer...I was hoping to use this to fade some dark spots however and I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes after 3 weeks. But I will continue to use this on my face as a nightly moisturizer, it feels just so luxurious on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love all Radha products but this one came to me already opened.</li>
    <li> This cream really does make a difference!  I love how it makes my skin feel!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make me break out which is amazing. Gives a nice glow</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer it perfectly fits my dry/oily/sensitive skin &amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Left skin red and sensitive after 1 use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t generally like trying new moisturizers because they are all so heavy and leave my skin feeling greasy. This was not the case at all with the Radha Retinol moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now and I love it. It is light and absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily. I really recommend this product a lot.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! it is non greasy and very hydrating . my skin is softer and my face is clearer i havent broken out at all. 😄😍</li>
    <li> I purchased this moisturizer along with the vitamin C and the eye serum to use as my daily regimen. They are all amazing products and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with the Radha line of skin care products. This is my first purchase and I am very pleased. I have only been using the product for about a month but can already see some fine lines have disappeared and some deep wrinkles have noticeably softened. It takes two full pumps to cover my face, neck and deck and I apply it twice a day. It absorbs really quickly, so for consistent, even coverage I pump the two pumps into my left hand or fingertips, then dab with my right hand and do a section of my face at a time. The only draw back may be the packaging, in that there is no way to tell when you are running low. Like I said though, I have been using the product for a month and a few days (at 4 pumps a day) and I have not run out yet. Even with the packaging drawback, I would not give this anything less than 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer, feels fluid and hydrating.</li>
    <li> After using this for about a week my skin feels smoother and fine lines on my forehead are diminishing.</li>
    <li> - &amp;#34;I tried this as soon as it arrived this morning, along with Serum C which also arrived. They go on so smoothly and my face feels incredible -- so clean and soft. I am a senior citizen still trying to hold it all together and I am very pleased with your products. Thank you.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The cream doesn&#x27;t come out of the container.</li>
    <li> No improvement. The original product came in a damaged container and Radha overnights a replacement. Unfortunately it was not effective on my 68 year old skin. I guess I was hoping for a miracle. The lotion did help hydrate</li>
    <li> I have acne scarring, and this product helped lighten them quite a bit. I was shocked at how well it worked. It also moisturized very well. I can&#x27;t comment on its ability to prevent aging and reduce wrinkles since I have none at this point (lucky--I know). The texture of the product is pretty good. I do feel like it takes a while to soak in, but that is really the only negative. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got 3 uses from this bilottle. My husband cut it open because I thought the pump fell out. It turns out that underneath the fancy bottle was only a tiny little chamber that could only hold a trial size amount</li>
    <li> I was not impressed at all with this cream. I bought it only because of the great reviews and people said it made there skin velvety feeling and soft. Did the exact opposite for me. Was very drying for me. Oh well.</li>
    <li> Only been using for a week.....goes on smooth...feels good on skin...</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for almost 2 months.  I didn&#x27;t want to write a review until I had used it for some time.  I have to say this did not break my skin out, which for me is always a plus.  It also was not heavy for the humid summer months, which I liked.  Having said all that I just did not see a real difference in my skin.  My dark spots didn&#x27;t look any different.  As far as wrinkles go I really don&#x27;t think anything does very much when it comes to wrinkles so I wasn&#x27;t  to worried.  I guess my complaint is I didn&#x27;t notice any brightness to my skin or anything really drastic to get me to purchase again.  So I have been cutting my proactive clarifying night cream open to use what remains , because it&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
    <li> This is so amazing! I didn&#x27;t subscribe to it the first time because I was testing it out, but people are now constantly asking if I&#x27;m pregnant because this has made my skin start glowing! It&#x27;s also helped a lot with my scars! I bought my second bottle and now am subscribed. This is amazing!</li>
    <li> First, let me say, I DID NOT receive this product for free. I purchased it. And I am so glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin. I have an oil T zone and chin, but the rest of my face is dry and flaky. This moisturizer is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> I was sent a different product than this.  I was sent the Skin Clearing Serum. I&#x27;m glad! IT&#x27;S MIRACULOUS is all I can say.  I&#x27;m 58, and have had adult acne for the past 10 + years.  Nothing I&#x27;ve tried from very expensive high end products to ProActiv has helped.  This cleared my skin in two days, and it looks healthy!  I am buying more right now.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a difference since using the product.  My husband has started using it also.</li>
    <li> I am 56 years young. I recently learned of Radha products and I&#x27;m in love!!! Over the years I&#x27;ve tried many different products and have never been thrilled. Radha Beauty products are wonderful. I am getting the results I have longed for. The products are very reasonably priced and a little goes a long way. Happy Girl here! If you don&#x27;t smile you&#x27;ll get your money back.</li>
    <li> I love my purchase. It arrived before it was expected nicely packed. I tried it and it is great! I highly recommend it to all ladies out there !I It leaves your skin fresh and healthy. Thank you! Great seller.</li>
    <li> I am 27 with sun damage and uneven skin AND acne.  And this stuff saved my face!  My face is clear, my skin tone is almost even (I&#x27;ve only used it for a month)  and I literally have no more lines and wrinkles under my eyes and forehead. I always hated my laugh lines and they are even faded.  I put this on every morning and night.  And seeing the visible changes had made me much for careful with my skin.  I actually wear sunblock now.  Anyways try it.  I&#x27;ve used other retinal creams and even expensive stuff like Neruim, and this is good, trust me.</li>
    <li> I love using this moisturizer as part of my night-time routine. I usually wash my face, tone it, and apply the serum in the evening with a heavy moisturizer. I have issues with fine lines  on my forehead and large pores, so I was excited to use this to help them out. It really does plump up your skin and make it look brighter and more youthful. This moisturizer comes in a very nice looking bottle. There is not a huge amount of product but I think it is okay because you only need o use a small amount.I also like the fact that it comes with a pump lid, which is so easy to use. There is a light scnt to it but its not unappealing and doesn&#x27;t last long. I have used different Radha Beauty products and have been please with them all. I also have sensitive skin so  I am uneasy trying new products but I experienced  no negative products while using this. I received this product at a discount in exchange for a review but this my honest opinion based on my experience.</li>
    <li> Once again, Radha Beauty has came through with another great product! Retinol Moisturizing Cream is really helping me with my very dry and acne prone skin. With only a couple of weeks use every night, I&#x27;ve literally woken up in the morning, not feeling like my skin has sucked up all my moisturizer. It feels so soft and hydrated after my daily morning routine. My acne is at bay.. thank goodness! I most definitely, recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Because a retinol product takes a long time to work, this review, for now, is just about the my overall initial impression.  The packaging is sleek and beautiful to hold and touch.  The dispenser is PERFECT for measuring out a controlled amount of product.  The product itself feels like a very rich lotion but slightly lighter than a cream I think.  There is no scent from what I can determine and is perfect for those that are scent sensitive.  I&#x27;ve had no adverse reactions whatsoever and am looking forward to the long term benefits.  If this cream is as wonderful as their eye gel and peppermint oil (5 stars!) I will be thrilled!</li>
    <li> Just to be clear I literally hate trying new moisturizers because my skin is so sensitive and I always seem to breakout.  Please make sure you read this entire review and dont stop after the next sentence!  Of course my skin did indeed have a breakout BUT it was a small one... but what happened after is where the MIRACLE happened!!! It was like every single poor on my face was gone after the breakout- my skin was literally GLOWING and the texture of my skin is so incredibly soft- to the point even my hubby noticed.  Even with getting a facial once a month my skin has never looked this good.  Normally when you see the word &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; on a product you instantly think ... &amp;#34;yeah right&amp;#34; but I assure you- this product does exactly what it says and more.  I&#x27;m actually shocked how much I like ... no... LOVE it.  Goodbye to overpriced products that don&#x27;t deliver.  The price, the quality and the impressive results are above and beyond what I expected.  Thank you for making such a good product line - every single item I have tried I love!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many of high ends face products before as much as $200+ a bottle for many years and did not see much effect as this product! I am on my 2nd bottle and the result keeps impressing me and getting compliments how glowing my skin is! I just hope they won&#x27;t change anything on it!</li>
    <li> This is the second product from the Radha Beauty company I have purchased and I LOVE IT! This moisturizer is light and leaves my skin feeling great all day!</li>
    <li> The product is presented very well with the container it comes in.  The product looks luxurious and high end.  However, despite its lavish looks, the container is pretty big just to hold 1-oz of cream.  It was a bit deceiving, because it definitely looks like it can hold more than an ounce.  But in terms of the actual cream, I like it a lot.  it&#x27;s odorless, which is nice, and it feels very airy and light.</li>
    <li> The first 2-3 days of use had me in aw. I woke up with glowing skin and thought this really is a miracle serum. However, after daily use for over a week I didn&#x27;t notice any real difference. I&#x27;m not sure if my skin just got used to it but there was no change I texture, glow etc.</li>
    <li> Ok I&#x27;ve been using it only for 2 weeks and I absolutely love it! In fact that&#x27;s the only product that I notice improvement every morning I look in the mirror! I&#x27;m 29 I have wrinkles on the forehead but over all I have acne prone skin but this cream seem to solve that problem as well! My skin is less oily , no new pimples and wrinkles are becoming less visible. I will be ordering again for me and my 54 year old mom ! I absolutely recommend it to anyone just make sure you put SPF over this cream during a day!</li>
    <li> I am not a big fan of retinol products but I thought I would try this one. I know with products that have retinol you have to give it some time to really work and help your skin.After a few days my face looked bumpy and dull. Then I started to break out again after I had cleared it up from the serum. I have very sensitive skin so this was a total thumbs down for me. My face looked old and gross. I really really hate retinol products.</li>
    <li> There is nothing special about it. Actually just container is sort of special. It feels little oily on my skin and caused me some pimples.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too early to say anything but I noticed some improvements on my face. I love this product</li>
    <li> Good product just stated using it</li>
    <li> I really like this Moisturizing cream. It is moisturizing without being oily. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  It is fragrance free. (very light natural nutty smell) I am currently using it with an Astaxanthin serum I have, but can&#x27;t wait to try Radha&#x27;s Vitamin C serum with it next. Bye bye dry winter skin. Hello bright and smooth! :)</li>
    <li> I really love this moisturizer.  It&#x27;s very light and absorbs quickly so I can put my makeup right on.  The beautiful packaging dispenses just the right amount of product too.  Within a couple of days, I saw improvement in the softness of my skin and two dark spots have significantly lightened.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I love this product because it is a SUPER MOISTURIZER that is made from 71% ORGANIC ingredients Organic Aloe, Green Tea, Jojoba oil, Shea Butter. I use it as a night &amp; day moisturizing cream to reduce Wrinkles, Fine Lines and Dark Spots. I have noticed a difference since using this product &amp; would recommend it to a friend. I feel it leaves my complexion with a radiant glow. These opinions in my review are that solely of my own after my own personal experience with this product.</li>
    <li> I have used many and this is far the best , takes years off your face</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing for my face. It actually dried my fave out terribly.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! It was sent to me after the eye gel did not work plus got my money back! I love this cream and will purchase more when I run out! It makes my skin smooth and my skin stopped breaking out!</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful.  Love the smell.</li>
    <li> Great product Radha...love the scent and feel of the product.</li>
    <li> Broke out while using this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered 3 of these - The lotion is fabulous but the pump keeps malfunctioning!  I thought I&#x27;d written a review, but I guess I only posted seller feedback - and they haven&#x27;t responded at all.  It&#x27;s a great product if you can actually access it ... I guess you decide whether or not it&#x27;s worth the gamble as it doesn&#x27;t look like they will help you if the pump is faulty.  I&#x27;ll purchase again once they put it in a tube!</li>
    <li> I love the feel &amp; results of the Radha products I have bought recently. I use the vitamin C serum first, then the eye gel &amp; finish with the retinol moisturizor cream. At 64 I can honestly say I am expecting continued positive results as I use these products twice a day. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Wife said it worked well</li>
    <li> It is not a one day miracle, but after 2 weeks of use I am seeing beautiful results.  Will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> This moisturizing cream feels so good going on and looks even better under my make-up! I love it!</li>
    <li> I have used this for 3 days now and I love how much softer my skin feels after using it. I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I Love Radha Retinol Moisturizing Cream! I use it in conjunction with Radha Rosehip Oil. This product is  71% organic,which made me very interested in trying it.  It has a nice light fresh scent and has not irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love Radha Beauty products but I&#x27;ve seen amazing results having now used their retinol moisturizer for approx 3+ months now. It has made a notable difference on my face and neck. My friends have even asked what I&#x27;ve done differently.  I have very sensitive skin and it hasn&#x27;t irritated it at all either. I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this skin care line!</li>
    <li> Only one cream I can use day and night, so convenience. It is perfect for the people like me who is lazy to put different cream on the face everyday. So far I tried different products of this brand. This one is my favorite. My skin absorbs by the way and I feel my face moisture and fresh. Absolutely I will keep to us this product.</li>
    <li> This cream has made a big difference on the dry patches that have been on my skin for years. A little bit goes a long way and it&#x27;s a big bottle. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Literally a face lift in a bottle!  Love it!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is very good for my skin.  I use it at night, and I can tell a difference in the way my skin looks in the morning.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be really working with my skin - it helps make it smoother, clear up acne and spot problems, and increase the cell turnover rate.  However, it seems certain patches of skin may not be able to replenish as fast and it will create a dry area, so just give less cream to those spots.  Also, the pump case it comes with did not work correctly.  Nothing would come out when I pumped it - I had to remove the center canister from the outside case and then it worked.  Seems like a faulty design.  Otherwise I&#x27;m happy with it and will buy more.</li>
    <li> my skin feels smoother</li>
    <li> Great seller- Great value-Great Experience.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Non-greasy and absorbs well. Perfect under make-up or alone.</li>
    <li> Radha Beauty has done it once again with another great product! it&#x27;s really helping me with my dry face issues .It&#x27;s very light-weight and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on my face, I&#x27;ve been so impressed with all of Radha&#x27;s products, and this one is another winner!</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: compensation for this review was in the form of the moisturizer and accompanying products  via Brandbacker &amp; Radha Beauty, but opinions are all mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am at the age where I am starting to care more and more about my skin and wrinkles that may form in the future. I had tried a couple of Retinol moisturizers in the past, and let me just say that I had almost given up on my relationship with Retinol. When I tried Radha&#x27;s Retinol moisturizer, I was amazed. My sensitive skin reacted rather well and I felt no burning NOR did I break out. The formula was a bit greasy, but absorbed quite well.</li>
    <li> Update; I have been using this moisturizer and their eye gel for a good five. months. My wrinkles have diminished a little bit but not Completly and the eye gel has literally done nothing for five months of usage. I&#x27;m so disappointed I had such high hopes for these products.  They all run out entirely to fast for their price&#x27;s as well. Waste  of hundreds  of dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this moisturizer! I have lupus and it wears on my face &amp;#34;malar rash&amp;#34; Radha&#x27;s miracle moisturizer glides right on without any harsh burning effect!! This skin care line is really useable for any face type weather you have ezema or a lupus rash my face is even less red than usual! im super excited to see what long term results come from this skin care line!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a semi-broke college student, however, I thought that now would be a great time to start building up a skincare regimen that would last a lifetime. I thought this moisturizer would be great. I was wrong. I have used this for a little over three weeks. The texture and scent were perfect, however, I did notice a slight tingling/stinging sensation. I attributed it to the retinol content. No biggie.  After the first week is when I really began to notice how irritated my skin became after using this product. It was very red (good time to mention that I&#x27;m golden-toned with medium to deep colored skin) and almost stung to the point of almost being itchy. I don&#x27;t have any active acne or open wounds on m face and I am not allergic to any of the ingredients listed so I&#x27;m really confused about why my skin reacted in such a way. I guess I&#x27;ll have to stick to my Clean and Clear. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great facial cream that doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy. It works wonders under makeup as well. My skin looks so much better than I could have imagined. Minimized pores, fading acne scars, and wrinkles are disappearing before my very eyes. Customer service was also so helpful and answered all my questions and sent me a replacement bottle right away when my pump didn&#x27;t work. I am a huge fan!!</li>
    <li> I will continue to buy this product - works exceptionally well!</li>
    <li> fast delivery, use this daily, skin is firmer, no smell noted, ordered more already, supply last about full month</li>
    <li> Super impressed with this product. The packaging is amazing the bottle is awesomely designed. Easy to use pic they show makes it look short and fat its not at all. It&#x27;s very stylish looking.  Unlike other products the first ingredient is aloe not water!  Wash your face and apply this is not greasy and absorbs quickly. It feels great on your skin. Pumps out nice and easy and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. I was sent this product free to review and have gave an honest opinion of it.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous about trying this product. I have sensitive prone skin and I am usually afraid of trying new moisturizers out. I will say that when I first tried this out, my face broke out. My face only broke out a little bit and it lasted for about a week. Now my face is clear of acne, super soft, and my pores decreased in size! It evened out my complexion and left my skin feelin so healthy. I would definitely recommend this product...especially for those who have sensitive, combination skin like myself!</li>
    <li> Great product!! My face felt nourished and smooth when I woke up in the morning. I would order this again!</li>
    <li> So far, I like this cream.  My skin seems to look better.  I haven&#x27;t been using it that long, but I am empressed.  It seems to do the job as well, if not better than the more expensive creams.  The only problem I have, is the packaging.  I can&#x27;t see when I need to order more!</li>
    <li> Now usually I don&#x27;t write reviews . But I&#x27;m going to give it the honest to god truth. I bought this moisturizer thinking that it was gonna do some good to my skin and help my fine lines and weinkles... This did NOTHING. I&#x27;ve used it for a month and found no improvement. After I use the bottle, it&#x27;ll be the last one !</li>
    <li> I cannot say good enough stuff about this product my face feels amazing instantly after I used it I snapped a picture of myself and send it to my sister and told her she needed to buy it love love love this.</li>
    <li> Got it as a sample. and it is really great, doing electrolysis and it is helping a lot with scarring.</li>
    <li> I have already fallen in love with several Radha Beauty products in my medicine cabinet, but this one just became my favorite! Within only days of using this cream I noticed a definite overall evening out of the skin tone, reduced pore size and a more glowing complection in the morning. I am very pleased with this purchase and can highly recommend this cream to anyone looking for a healthy boost to their skin regimen!</li>
    <li> I love this pump canister for their Retinol Moisturizing cream.  Its nice to just pump and have a bit come out the top. Its easy and clean this way. The ingredients are great in this cream, with 2.5% retinol you know you&#x27;re getting the max. And with the other combined ingredients its top notch. I love that the main base is organic aloe vera. Aloe vera is great for my sking and I&#x27;ve used it for years so I was pleasantly surprised that this was one of the main ingredients.  It also has green tea in it which is great for your skin. After using this for a week, I noticed a softer skin that felt more hydrated. Normally after showering my skin becomes very dry and tight. After using this out of the shower, it soothed my dry skin. It definitely made a difference. I also have sensitivity to certain chemicals and I didn&#x27;t have any reactions using this product at all.</li>
    <li> What can I say, Radha has done it again.  I love this product.  It&#x27;s not too greasy yet provides great moisture to my skin.  And, the best part is the thought they put into using organic ingredients instead of all of the harmful chemicals found in most moisturizers!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Product is okay, but I didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Radha Beauty Products, as I have used quite a number of their products with great results. I am a big fan and aficionado of anti aging products because I am in my mid thirties and know for a fact that I should start taking extra care of my skin as early as possible. This Retinol Moisturizer, like all of Radha Beauty&#x27;s other products, satisfied everything that I am looking for in a moisturizer. It targets my problem areas like fine lines, it moisturizes my perpetually dry skin and helps it retain moisture and it is very well priced. It has Retinol as one of its active ingredients - and this, I believe, is what is truly working on eradicating what fine lines I have. Two thumbs up for this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> Works really well. I will buy this product again</li>
    <li> First I was given a reduced price to try this product.  That does not negate this review, nor should it be deleted.  I like this product and use it every morning.  It is easy to use and feels great on my face.  This company has great products I have purchased and customer service, and will continue to do so.  This is my first experience with retinol and so far so good.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product a 2nd time- I use it daily before I put my makeup on. I apply it to my chest, neck and face(focusing on forehead, around eyes, and jawbone. I feel my skin tone is more even. My wrinkly and sometimes puffy eyes are much firmer. A little bit goes a long way. Not as drying as other retinol creams. Plus I was excited to find this cream with organic properties!</li>
    <li> I have only used this cream 3 days twice daily.,, and yet I can see a noticeable difference in my skin. I love how it feels going on, and it makes my skin glow! I have already ordered again to let my friend try!  I can&#x27;t wait to see results in a month!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 26, and I have young-looking skin, but I still want to be a step ahead of wrinkles and sun damage. I have more trouble with acne than aging, but this cream is great for both. It&#x27;s very moisturizing, but has no greasy feel and when I do have a small breakout, it heals quickly. It has also improved the texture of my skin and helped to minimize the look of the pores around my t-zone. I&#x27;ve been prescribed retin-A, and this cream works just as well. A+</li>
    <li> I started using this and I notice when I wake up in the morning, my skin is clear from any acne or weird spots. My skin feels really soft when I&#x27;m washing it in the shower, I can use my exfoliator much less. It keeps my skin recycling instead of dead. I like how my skin looks and feels in the morning after using this at night.</li>
    <li> Wonderful cream that you only need a portion the size of your fingernail to get great results. It moistens my dry skin all day long. I like that it is long lasting. My wrinkles are gone. I like this product. It honestly works similar as a name brand product, but without the high price tag.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product, it is so silky and feels wonderful when I put it on. It&#x27;s fragrance is a barely there floral that is much lighter than many &#x27;fragrance free&#x27; I have experienced. I am confident in the products offered by Radha Beauty Products, am enjoying all those I have tried. The packaging is very well done and the delivery prompt.</li>
    <li> seems to work very well i like the results so far</li>
    <li> My skin is loving this moisturizer. My fine lines have diminished and my skin feels smoother. Great product! Radha customer service  is wonderful too.</li>
    <li> light wight,moisturize without the feeling of oiliness.. it also prevents the acne break outs..and makes your face smooth and feeling younger..</li>
    <li> They give away discounts and free product for good reviews. This product does nothing absolutely nothing...except maybe make your make up peel off. Stop giving easy discounts for good reviews you are a scam bad product.</li>
    <li> excellent product thanks so much</li>
    <li> Love this product! I apply this at night only and my skin looks beautiful/softer after using for only 1 week. There is a slight stinging but it doesn&#x27;t last long. It&#x27;s my first time using a retinol product and I am happy with the results. Super pleased!!! Seller is super quick to respond! Great customer service also!!!!</li>
    <li> I did get a coupon to review this but the opinion is my own ... It feels great and is not sticky nor greasy... Plus it works face is way smoother than ever before.</li>
    <li> I think it is helping eliminate some fine lines in my face. This lotion also makes my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> Radha products are wonderful and I love their skin care line. This was deeply moisturizing but wasn&#x27;t heavy or oily.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, I have just used it for a few days, but my skin feels wonderful and looks great. I can&#x27;t wait to see my skin after using it for awhile. I used all there products now and what a difference in my skin and how I look. I am over 70, it has made a big difference on how I look.</li>
    <li> Greasy, oily and thick. Clogs up in the small opening. Pump will never let you know how much is really left in the bottle. But it does help my wrinkles, just not my pores. So heavy!</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried retinol before but I&#x27;m glad that I took a chance with this moisturizer. Like all of the other products by Radha that I have tried, I&#x27;ve loved it and it&#x27;s cruelty free.</li>
    <li> Love the way my skin feels. I have oily skin and this didn&#x27;t make me break out and didn&#x27;t feel greasy. I was using a much more expensive retinol lotion that felt very, I don&#x27;t want to say cheap, just not creamy at all, a little too thin. The lotion had a shimmering to it that I felt gave the illusion of it working, by brightening your face. This is TOTALLY DIFFERENT and amazing! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a week and love it! It hasn&#x27;t caused redness or breakouts but my skin already feels smoother. Product arrived quickly and in great shape.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this now for a week I have noticed major difference and thank you for letting me try this out for free I love to that price good amount I&#x27;m excited to finish the bottle up and probably get moreI hope everybody buys product it was really really good as I said I really appreciate it</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this after reading the reviews, but after two weeks of using this product, my face is oily and breaking out. I really like Radha, but so disappointed with this skincare line.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing! One of the best retinol products I used to date.  Will definitely be ordering again</li>
    <li> The only thing I would like to see change is the bottle. It would be great to see how much is left in the bottle so I don&#x27;t run out before I can re- order.</li>
    <li> This is the best Retinol product out there.  And, not to mention, the price is just right.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without this one.  I read somewhere that an older woman with beautiful skin was asked what she did for her face each day and she said, &amp;#34;Retinol, Retinol, Retinol.&amp;#34;  I found my go to face moisturizer.  It is all I use on my face.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer.  A little goes a long way.  I am a huge fan of all Rachael products.  The price is amazing and the products really work great.  I have tried much more expensive products with less results .  The argon oil is amazing and the rosehip oil is fabulous.  Then eye cream is great, the only thing better would be an eye lift, and who wants to go through that.  Radha makes amazing products.  Oh I got the coconut oil and added it to body lotion and body cleaner.  What a difference it makes.  Love,love,love.</li>
    <li> Works as well as Retin A without the excessive peeling.  After cleansing with my oil cleanser mixture I use a toner of half water and apple cider vinegar; Radha Vitamin C Serum and finally the Radha Retinol Moisturizer cream.  Very, very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> The retinol face moisturizer cream works well on my skin (combination type). I feel some differences (a biter smoother and less oily) after applying it. I will recommend this.</li>
    <li> One must use this product for at least 2 months to see any changes. I bought in early May, so I&#x27;m hoping to see some changes by July.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Saw a difference in completion within a week</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer! Feels light on the skin, non-greasy. My skin felt softer and smoother after only one application! Can&#x27;t wait to see how this improves my skin over time.</li>
    <li> I have tried several Radha products and keep coming back for the quality and guarantee. This is my favorite Radha product so far. My skin was dry and flaky due to the winter cold and dry house; I tried virtually everything (lots of oils, including rosehip, argan, and coconut), but the only thing that worked to quench my dry skin and make it soft and supple was the Radha Retinol Moisturizing cream. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. I find that I only need a small pump of product to cover my entire face and it leaves my skin so soft and smooth and not greasy.  I did receive a coupon to try this product for free but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have been using all 3 of Radha Beauty&#x27;s fantastic skincare products daily for a week now. After I wash and dry my face I apply the Vitamin C serum. The Serum is very thin and dries quickly. Then I apply the Eye Gel. The eye gel cools as it goes on, and feels great on my tired eyes. Immediately after applying the eye gel the puffiness around my eyes is improved and I feel a more awake. Finally, I apply the Retinol Moisturizer. The Retinol moisturizer comes in a beautiful silver bottle which dispenses just the right amount. It goes on smooth and is absorbed very quickly. My skin drinks it right up! I love that this moisturizer keeps my skin moisturized all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of all 3 Radha Beauty skincare products leaves my skin feeling very soft, smooth, moisturized, and firm. To be honest, my skin has never felt this soft. I’m impressed! I will continue to use these 3 awesome Radha Beauty products daily and I look forward to seeing their long term results on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend investing in the entire skincare line of Radha Beauty products - they are fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for sharing my honest opinion of the product. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
    <li> Great product! Makes my skin soft and is perfect under makeup. Not greasy at all! Love</li>
    <li> IF YOU ARE A SKEPTIC ON A TIGHT BUDGET WITH FACIAL ECZEMA THAT HAS HAD TO PAY MORE THAN WHAT YOU&#x27;RE COMFORTABLE PAYING ON CREAMS LOTIONS AND BALMS, YOU SHOULD REALLY TRY THIS.  IT HAS A HIGHER PRICE TAG, BUT YOU WILL SAVE MORE MONEY THAN YOU WOULD BUYING CHEAPER MOISTURIZERS MONTHLY. I couldn&#x27;t find anything to help the flaky oozy eczema that started this year on my face above and below my lips.  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of creams, lotions, oil and/or combinations. I&#x27;ve had eczema on my hands for years that is tolerable as long as I apply Aveeno lotion (of any kind) after every time I wash my hands, but my face can&#x27;t deal with constant touch with even the most gentle moisturizer application.  I needed something to help me heal as well as continually keeping the moisture from leaving me like a bad date escaping out the back door.  I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this.  I always have some sort of eczema balm that I have to apply throughout the day so I don&#x27;t get the flakiness, but that&#x27;s like putting a spotlight on my skin issues, because most of them are shiny like lip gloss.  I thought I was doomed to shiny red patches around my mouth forever, and every doctor will tell you not to use a steroid cream near your eyes or lips, yet the only thing they really prescribe is (big surprise)... ah yes, steroid cream.  I put this cream on the first night I got it, and in the morning I woke up astounded.  I didn&#x27;t put any balm or Aveeno or anything else on my face when I went to bed just this cream.  I expected to wake up with a little flakiness at the least.  The redness and the flakiness was practically gone, and my skin kept the moisture and started to heal!  I usually won&#x27;t pay any more than $10 for a lotion or cream, but having to buy several bottles of various lotions every month adds up, so I got desperate. I was very skeptical, and I didn&#x27;t believe that any product could get the amount of positive reviews that this one has.  There has to be at least a dozen that complained profusely just for the sake of having something to complain about.  Even if the pump didn&#x27;t work, this stuff is liquid gold, and I&#x27;d be pouring it into a tupperware container if need be.  A tiny drop of this goes a long long way, like east coast to west coast long way, seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips on Application:&lt;br /&gt;After you wash your face leave your skin a little damp. Pump once and dot on forehead and cheeks.  You just need use a finger and spread it out on your cheeks, across your nose, and across your forehead.  Pump one more time and use this to get the most sensitive spots that need a little extra like around your eyes, mouth and chin. You may get a little sting if your skin is already rubbed raw and/or weeping.  Don&#x27;t let this scare you off, the acids in this cream are incredibly beneficial to your skin and will help it fight off the eczema. If it&#x27;s too much, dilute. Put a little of water in your palm and a drop of this cream, mix, and very gently apply like a glaze. Last step, sleep on it.  Easy enough and it will save your face and you from embarassment.sely just for the sake of having something to complain about.

    <li> Excellent service, wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Easy to use feels nice on my skin</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m not sure exactly how long I&#x27;ve been using this...probably a good two months.  I&#x27;m into my second bottle now, and I absolutely love this product.  I started noticing a difference in my skin fairly quickly,  but what has amazed me is the continued improvement over time.  I am a redhead, so my skin tone is a bit naturally blotchy, and I have some mild acne scarring.  This has left my skin firmer, improved its tone, reduced fine lines, and (as an unexpected topping on the cake) has even reduced my acne scarring.  I have been very happy with the results and will continue using this product.  My regimen is a gentle facewash, astringent,  a touch of 10% benzoyl (only in the a.m.), Radha&#x27;s intensive youth eye gel (which I&#x27;ll review separately), and a oil - free hypoallergenic moisturizer twice daily.  It&#x27;s really working wonders so far.  I highly recommend both of these Radha products.  Also, the company goes out of its way to make sure you are happy as a consumer.  If you have been looking for a retinol cream, you should really give this one a shot.</li>
    <li> Dead on arrival: pump messed up..</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Radha Beauty skincare products and this one was no disappointment! Miracle, The Retinol Moisturizer is hands down, the best moisturizer I have ever used.  It has moisturized my skin so well, that I don&#x27;t even need to use it daily. I use it every other day and my skin stays smooth and soft. I typically have oily skin, except in the winter time, when it&#x27;s extremely dry and acne prone. This has tamed my acne too, surprisingly, (not cured it, just tamed it...skin is less inflamed). This has brought life back into my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am proud to have this product in my skincare routine. I would recommend it to EVERYBODY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: All NATURAL, Organic, Non-Irritating, Smooths Skin, Minimizes Pores, Pleasant Fragrance, Nice Packaging, Very thick &amp; creamy consistency&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  None to list!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Package arrived promptly &amp; was packaged very neatly in bubble wrap!</li>
    <li> Loved it...it really works!!! Breakout and pimple marks disappered..</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer to apply before make-up! It doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily and it feels great afterwards! Highly recommend. :D</li>
    <li> I received sooner than I expected which was nice. I&#x27;m trying the Radha Eye cream for 2 weeks, then try to remember to re-review it and their Radha Moisturizer with Retinol I received yesterday. The Radha Eye cream does make my eyes feel and look refreshed. I&#x27;m using morning and night as Radha suggests. So far, I like both products a lot!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL..,NON IRRITATING...goes on smooth and sinks in right away..does NOT leave ANY TYPE OF FILM on your face...YOUR FACE WILL THANK YOU and the dispenser is RIGHT ON.......a little comes out, because a LITTLE is all you need........VERY  COST EFFECTIVE</li>
    <li> I was skeptical - but ordered it anyway! To my happy amazement - it works! And o noticed improvement almost immediately in the deepness of the 11 lines on my forehead between my eyes! My overall texture and brightness of my skin is better also! At 43 - I&#x27;ve notcied changes in my skin, and this is a great defense against those changes! Hubs has notcied and wants his own!</li>
    <li> My experience:&lt;br /&gt;The first days i really didn&#x27;t know what to say about the product because it was very skeptical about it and since retinol and my skin seem to not agree with each other normally, but with this product everything changed.&lt;br /&gt;My skin, normally very dry, is really hydrated and not dry at all.&lt;br /&gt;I like how practical the little pump is and how the product is not too greasy or too oily. It&#x27;s has a perfect consistency and it&#x27;s absorbed by the skin very quickly. The product is not heavy at all.&lt;br /&gt;I Love the fact that is 71% organic and that comes in a very light plastic but yet very beautiful packaging. It comes in a 30ml/1 oz container. It&#x27;s not tested on animals and you have a 100% quality guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try and you will love it too!</li>
    <li> nice moisturizer, feels good on the face</li>
    <li> I work in beauty and wash my hands often and am also expected to have good skin to sell my &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34;. I am very sensitive to areas where my skin may be starting to show signs of aging, primarily my neck, cheeks, and my hands. I use this cream on those three areas and the dark spots on my hands I had after a long day out in the sun have faded. Call me vain, but I intend to keep this fresh glow for a long time--including on my hands--so I&#x27;m keeping up with this product!</li>
    <li> Seems legit. I needed something hydrating to use alternatively with vitamin C treatments. I have only been using this for a few days and already the pores on my nose look much less noticeable. Hydrates skin without appearing greasy, so I feel comfortable wearing this under my makeup for daytime. The smell and texture is comparable to Roc Retinol treatments, but without the stinging/burning sensation. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Great product! Moisturizers just right. Not too dry, not greasy. Will buy again when I run out</li>
    <li> This Stuff is AMAZING! I have used other products with Retinol and they all ended up drying out my skin, but not this one! It makes my skin look flawless from the minute i put it on. I have been using this for a few weeks now and i already see a huge difference in my fine lines. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> Item arrived two days ahead of schedule. The formula is light enough for day time use, but moisturizing enough for night use as well. So far, impressed with the overall tone of my skin after just a few uses.</li>
    <li> I use this cream combine with vitamin c serum, it seems working pretty good together make my skin brighter &amp; wrinkle less noticeable. Very happy with the result and their products are affordable.</li>
    <li> Did not have much effect on my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy, I finally have a skin care regimen that I will keep!! 3 of Rahda Beauty Products are included in my routine! After cleansing and toning, I apply Rahda&#x27;s Eye Gel, Vitamin C Serum, then the Retinol Moisturizer.  I could see and feel a difference in my skin just after the first application. I&#x27;m on day 3 of using Rahda&#x27;s products and I&#x27;m more than happy with the results!!!</li>
    <li> Want the Jessica Alba glow? This stuff works wonders. Not too heavy, but still moisturizing. I use this as my night cream and use an spf face moisturizer during the day because I want to look 40 at 60. I am sensitive to fragrance so I don&#x27;t think there is any in this or I would breakout.</li>
    <li> I noticed no difference at all and I am quite upset seeing that there were so many rave reviews. I used it consistently and nothing. I believe the rave reviews were posted because they were given the product for free or something because I noticed no changes in my skin and my skin is already fairly clear. I don&#x27;t see a glow...nothing! I was expecting a radiant, healthy glow and got nothing... I actually want my money back...</li>
    <li> I got this as a promotion for writing a review.  I have extremely dry skin and I usually purchase standard store brand lotion.  I thought I would give this a try since it was discounted.  I was impressed and noticed the value right away.  It didn&#x27;t take much to cover my dry skin and it lasted hours without feeling oily.  Now my only problem is that my gf is using it.</li>
    <li> So I have been using the products for about a1 1/2 weeks and I honestly have not noticed much of a difference in my skin besides it being soft. It is reccomended that you use the Serum first and then the moisturizer. Both products are very light which may be why it did not wow my skin. I can not judge for the anti-aging or fine lines. I can say that my pores remained fairly invisible when using this duo. I would recommend this product if your skin likes very light moisturizers and things, but if you&#x27;re like me and you need heavy moisturizers then this is not for you. Plus for them being a natural and organic line they have amazing prices. I hope they come out with face masks I would love to try those !</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 4 weeks. I have very sensitive skin, and usually breakout , but with this product ,no breakouts. You only have to use a small amount and it soaks right in,with a soft velvety feel. The texture of of skin is definitely improving. The packaging of this product is superb. Love this product, Thank you, Rhada</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product - completely safe for me despite odd allergy to all FDC colors.</li>
    <li> The pump did not work, couldn&#x27;t even try this, I sent it back for refund.  Seller did contact me, but I had already returned it.  Product might be fine, but the dispensing system did not work.</li>
    <li> This product is superb! I had undergone chemo treatments 3 years ago and had been suffering from really dry, (literally cracked) skin ever since. I had been trying different skin products locally in an effort to bring my skin back to normal. This product has made my skin feel silky soft. I now have a radiant, dewy look to my face :) Thank you Amazon for making this possible! Speedy shipping too!</li>
    <li> Wow.. I&#x27;m glad i found this product. I like this product because it has retinol which I found when I was researching that retinol helps to diminish or smooth out acne scars. Retinol helps to increase your cell turnover which helps to increase the production of your collagen on your face. And also, it has green tea which helps to calm your face and help to diminish redness in your face. When I tried this, I can see its results immediately. it smoothens my face and helps to reduce the redness on my face. moreover, I notice that some of my scars on my face, caused by acne, are a little bit unnoticeable and minimized. The product is not greasy at all; therefore this is great for oily-type skin. It does not cause breakout due to the green tea extract added to the product. I will continue using it and see the maximum results of it.</li>
    <li> I only gave it 4 stars because I just got it. So far it is nice and creamy and will see if it works</li>
    <li> The product is to promote cell turnover instantly with it’s 2.5% active retinol, vitamin E and green tea. However. after four weeks I noticed nothing. Although, after more research and consulting my dermatologist I found that it takes up to 12 weeks to see results with over-the-counter retinol products.</li>
    <li> After a couple of weeks my skin does have a glow, lines appear smoother and pores are  smaller.  I use this with their vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> I like the product ..Deducted a star because the dispenser is suspect.. Took several pumps to get the product out of the container..Good thing is once I got some out it only took a small amount to cover a large area of the skin. It left my skin feeling smooth and radiant looking.. It also smells pleasant.. Cant say much for wrinkle line because I don&#x27;t have any ...I did noticed a couple of dark spots seems to have lighten and or disappeared.  Going to try to use this product longer to see if it delivers...will follow up in 6 months</li>
    <li> Amazing moisturizer!!!</li>
    <li> It did not work for me at all,it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a retinol face cream until now.  I&#x27;ve only used this product a few times, and am already LOVING IT!  It&#x27;s light-weight and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on my skin, it absorbs quickly, and it&#x27;s fragrance-free.  I love that it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients and has no harmful chemicals or parabens.  I&#x27;ve been so impressed with all of Radha&#x27;s products, and this one is another winner!</li>
    <li> this cream works great..I love the how smooth it goes on your face and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I use it everyday and will def. buy more.&lt;br /&gt;Great company doing great things. They will respond to anything you need right away. ALl natural ingredients in everything they make.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for 1 week but my skin (extremely dry) feels very nice.</li>
    <li> Love their entire product  line!&lt;br /&gt;Nothing less than phenomenal!</li>
    <li> I am 42, with combination skin. My face unfortunately has started to show my age...wrinkles, fine lines, uneven skin tone, rough, bumpy texture and quite a lot of sun spots. Retinol creams have always been notorious for causing dryness, flaking, redness and irritation, so I was a little worried about what the side effects might be with this one. OMG! Ok...day 3 of using this, I woke up in the morning and looked in the mirror before washing my face. WOW. I cannot tell you how happy I was! Big smile on my face! After only 3 days, my skin tone had started evening out significantly, my sun spots were already getting lighter...and my favorite part? My skin wasn&#x27;t all bumpy! It was smooth for the first time in as long as I can remember! I actually had a glow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has absolutely amazed me. I love the way it feels going on...very silky and velvety. It doesn&#x27;t have a perfumy smell...smells very clean. And I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does for my fine lines and wrinkles over the next few weeks! It has had none of those harsh Retinol side effects. Oh, and can we talk about the bottle?! Really like the feel of it, very modern looking, larger than I thought it would be and the pump dispenses the perfect amount of moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love, love, love this stuff and have been telling everyone I know to get it...quickly! Try this. You will not be disappointed. It&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product sample in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> The best product I have used short of prescription</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product! Truly amazing! I also bought several other products from this company based on the wonderful reviews and I am so happy I did! My skin has never looked so good!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer!  I love the way it feels on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;  Have not used it long enough to see the difference yet since I used it only for 2 days.</li>
    <li> Believe it or not I have tried various other retinol creams and this one comes with hyaluronic AND green tea. It doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy or all slimy so you can probably even use this daily. Plus, a little goes a long way. LOVE IT! And it comes in a cute little fancy bottle.</li>
    <li> I got this moisturizer last week and I must say this is the best moisturizer I ever used, after applying this on my face it feels so good.  This isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky, My skin looks great and feels so fresh after using this.  I just love this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It plumps my face.  My upper lip looks especially better,</li>
    <li> 5 Stars - &amp;#34;Great Cream---has already changed my skin.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin. Went from using Clinique to ordering this after the great reviews. It goes on smoothly, feels fresh and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling. I haven&#x27;t broke out in a while and it seems to give my skin a slight glow. Wish it would take away some of my blemishes but not sure it is intended for that.. overall great product</li>
    <li> Love this product....fast shipping</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t pump so had to break the outer case</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product! I&#x27;ve only been using it 4 days and know I will never be without it. My acne has majorily cleared up and my skin was instantly smooth after the first use. I actually like looking at my face now!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely loving this moisturizer. Retinol is really great in reducing flaws on the skin, whether it&#x27;s acne scars, wrinkles, or fine lines. I have a couple of flaws that I&#x27;d like to reduce. After a couple weeks of using this moisturizer, I&#x27;ve really seen a difference. The blemishes on my face have reduces in size and are almost none existent. I really love this moisturizer and am thinking about buying another bottle when mine runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I got this product for free in exchange to test and review honestly.</li>
