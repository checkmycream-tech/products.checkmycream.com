      <li>I bought organic hemp seed oil along with jojoba, grapeseed, and sweet almond oil as an effort to create a perfect blend of oils for the oil cleansing method.</li>
      <li>Talk about making your skin feel better!</li>
      <li>My skin has never felt better!</li>
      <li>the growth rate wasnt that spectacular</li>
      <li>Just a drop will soften your skin nicely.</li>
      <li>Yes it&#x27;s that strong not in a good way.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best hemp seed oil I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even need to use pressed powder or anything anymore to freshen up my face and the best part is its all natural and absorbs so well.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is very, very light and nutty, and it fades to no scent within the hour.</li>
      <li>I am in love with this oil.</li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t got rid of any of my many, many nose blackheads, but then again, nothing ever has.</li>
      <li>I wish I could say more on the effects of hemp seed oil and psoriasis</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I have been pleased with this oil for moisturizing without clogging my pores.</li>
      <li>but I really love this product.</li>
      <li>Buy it from Dr Adorable.</li>
      <li>and I love them both.</li>
      <li>This hemp oil is lovely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied that this is a quality product.</li>
      <li>I also bought the hemp shampoo. :)</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>but I kinda regret that decision as I am not too sure if i will repurchase.</li>
      <li>Recently made some lip balm and added this to the mix with excellent results!</li>
      <li>This product is OK, but smells strong.</li>
      <li>It has great flavor, not much odor but definitely a good moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Wonderful stuff...used this to rub on my pregnant belly and didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark (while both my sisters and Mom did)</li>
      <li>Smells fine</li>
      <li>Good for sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>After just two days I noticed a huge difference, after a week my flaky skin problem along my hairline and forehead was gone.</li>
      <li>(he&#x27;s also on a strict gluten free diet).</li>
      <li>You get used to it after a while, but some light perfume or cologne will do the trick (even deodorant works).</li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly and applies easily</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m pretty sure it was an infection.</li>
      <li>I applied oil maybe 4 times a day being sure to really get it rubbed in around the edges.</li>
      <li>Dr Adorable sent me the right product the first time and</li>
      <li>This works great because I can open the lid and dip my finger tip in and get exactly the right amount I need.</li>
      <li>and I always got either not enough or more than I wanted (mostly more).</li>
      <li>It soaks in extremely quickly for an oil, and it leaves my skin feeling plump and moist, and not greasy.</li>
      <li>The price was very reasonable!</li>
      <li>If a kinda/sorta heavy smell of hemp is OK for you to smell like all day, it&#x27;s fine to put on the body, otherwise, it might be better to use just on your feet, on pets, shoes, etc.</li>
      <li>Turns out the Dr.adorable Hemp seed oil did far more for softening for my skin than the body shops \\&quot;hemp oil\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I think for the cost of a bottle of this stough it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
      <li>, it keeps my skin fresh even after I wake up in the morning.  </li>
      <li>Hemp oil is useful for a lot of things.</li>
      <li>It was lightly moisturizong not too much or littel but just right.</li>
      <li>I was happy because the thing the piercer gave to me was supposed to keep it clean and take away and prevent any infection which obviously didn&#x27;t help at all, and the oil instantly started making it shrink.</li>
      <li>I got it mainly for its good effect on skin such as it provides nutrition for your skin – antioxidant, protein, mineral-rich</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent like many of the other hemp oils too.</li>
      <li>It is high amounts of chlorophyll and good for eczema, psoriasis, acne, and dry</li>
      <li>Then it started growing very fast.</li>
      <li>I was considering using jojoba oil at first to cleanse my acne prone face.</li>
      <li>Looking forward to purchasing more in the future.</li>
      <li>I have not been to an airport since using this product so there is no telling if a drug sniffing dog will corner me on my next security line screening! : )</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to have it squirt out accidentally, leaving a mess to clean up.</li>
      <li>Boy it made my new growth very healthy, thick and super shinny...</li>
      <li>This tells me that someone just filled the bottle with who knows what and simply sells it on amazon.</li>
      <li>but much</li>
      <li>and I really did not feel like they are part of my skin.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really have a lot to compare to</li>
      <li>This oil is very concentrated so 8 oz.</li>
      <li>Only thing, it leaves your clothes smelling a bit funky after a while, but I think it was worth it!</li>
      <li>which I can&#x27;t say about many other moisturizers out there.</li>
      <li>The only thing is that the oil has a kind of musty smell when you keep it on for too long and the smell tends to linger.</li>
      <li>The reason I gave it a 4, is that the container (while a decent container) does not work well in dispensing this product.</li>
      <li>I used many lip balms cheapest to the most expensive nothing made me feel this way ....&lt;</li>
      <li>A few more days</li>
      <li>my lips became super soft the next morning...</li>
      <li>and my new bottle will be here tomorrow.</li>
      <li>Also, I bought a new bottle to apply to my psoriasis on my legs and arms.</li>
      <li>feel i got new pair of lips ...</li>
      <li>On the other hand, I&#x27;ve continued using pure hemp seed oil as a facial moisturizer simply because I love its smell and its texture.</li>
      <li>As far as getting rid of it completly I can&#x27;t say.</li>
      <li>I have aging acne prone skin and as far as natural oils go, hemp seed oil has a &#x27;0&#x27; comedogenic rating.</li>
      <li>And then it was completely gone.</li>
      <li>I tried it on my face once pure just a few drops rubbed in between my hands and patted it gently into my skin in an upward motion.</li>
      <li>so it takes a little effort to massage into the skin but is well worth it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got it mainly for its good effect on skin such as it provides nutrition for your skin – antioxidant, protein, mineral-rich&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that contains Vitamins A, B1, B2, B3, B6, C, D, and E. It is high amounts of chlorophyll and good for eczema, psoriasis, acne, and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the morning as moisturizer, it shows a little bit on the skin so use it like 30 minutes before you leave your home.</li>
    <li> I bought organic hemp seed oil along with jojoba, grapeseed, and sweet almond oil as an effort to create a perfect blend of oils for the oil cleansing method. I ended up never trying out the OCM out of sheer laziness and thus never used the hemp seed oil.  A couple weeks later, I started breaking out badly along my jawline, which has never happened to me in my entire life. I whipped out the hemp seed oil and slathered it along my jawline because I figured it was an odd green color and smelled earthy and natural, so it couldn&#x27;t hurt, right? The next day, the breakout was already well on its way towards healing up. I started to use hemp seed oil as a daily facial moisturizer, and the breakout cleared up completely. I thought I had found a miracle product! It immediately became my HG moisturizer!  Unfortunately, my jawline broke out again badly a few weeks later, even as I continued using the hemp seed oil on a daily basis. After this breakout cleared up, the same area broke out yet again another few weeks later. I had to then conclude that the breakout was hormonal and was going to stick with me for the rest of my life (bummer!).  On the other hand, I&#x27;ve continued using pure hemp seed oil as a facial moisturizer simply because I love its smell and its texture. It soaks in extremely quickly for an oil, and it leaves my skin feeling plump and moist, and not greasy. It works great under makeup. As a bonus, I don&#x27;t feel that it has broken out my skin at all, which I can&#x27;t say about many other moisturizers out there. I feel that it also helps my naturally extremely oily skin from being less shiny and greasy throughout the day; not a whole lot less shiny, but enough to notice, and that&#x27;s good enough for me. It hasn&#x27;t got rid of any of my many, many nose blackheads, but then again, nothing ever has.</li>
    <li> My dad has psoriasis and we&#x27;ve been using hemp seed oil on the dry patches. It works great at moisturizing and helping the healing process (he&#x27;s also on a strict gluten free diet). You can also use hemp seed oil on a variety of other things too, just google it. It&#x27;s great for your hair and cuticles as well! The only thing is that the oil has a kind of musty smell when you keep it on for too long and the smell tends to linger. You get used to it after a while, but some light perfume or cologne will do the trick (even deodorant works). Also, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM HOME FARMS &amp; GARDENS.  Buy it from Dr Adorable. Dr Adorable sent me the right product the first time and Home Farms &amp; Gardens sent me the wrong product twice.</li>
    <li> This product is OK, but smells strong. If a kinda/sorta heavy smell of hemp is OK for you to smell like all day, it&#x27;s fine to put on the body, otherwise, it might be better to use just on your feet, on pets, shoes, etc.</li>
    <li> Smells fine I tried it on my face once pure just a few drops rubbed in between my hands and patted it gently into my skin in an upward motion. It was lightly moisturizong not too much or littel but just right. I will try it again soon but diluted with my concotion of oils I have on hand.</li>
    <li> Talk about making your skin feel better! I have used coconut oil and ozonated olive oil and I love them both. Hemp seed oil is another great oil to add to the list. This stough goes on a bit thick so it takes a little effort to massage into the skin but is well worth it. After a couple hours it absorbes into the skin and seems to revitalize it leaving your skin feel years younger. Tried it on my daughter&#x27;s psoriasis and it gives her relief of the flaking and itching. It even seems to help heal it. As far as getting rid of it completly I can&#x27;t say. I wish I could say more on the effects of hemp seed oil and psoriasis but I can&#x27;t get my daughter to use it on a regulat basis. I think for the cost of a bottle of this stough it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
    <li> The oil is heavy to use before getting dressed and although it is not sticky, it has a heavy and saturated feel . It also has a hemp smell.</li>
    <li> This oil is very concentrated so 8 oz. will last a long time. A little goes a long way. Just a drop will soften your skin nicely. I&#x27;m satisfied that this is a quality product. The reason I gave it a 4, is that the container (while a decent container) does not work well in dispensing this product. I find it difficult to control and I always got either not enough or more than I wanted (mostly more). This stuff is sticky when first applied and can make a real mess if spilled. It&#x27;s easy to have it squirt out accidentally, leaving a mess to clean up. I had a spare wide mouth plastic Noxzema container that I cleaned up and transferred the product into. This works great because I can open the lid and dip my finger tip in and get exactly the right amount I need.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hemp seed oil I have ever used. The texture is perfect.</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff...used this to rub on my pregnant belly and didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark (while both my sisters and Mom did) Only thing, it leaves your clothes smelling a bit funky after a while, but I think it was worth it!</li>
    <li> This product came in a bit later than I expected however the product did meet my expectation. I am an AA woman and I got this oil to massage into my scalp as I heard it promotes hair growth... Boy it made my new growth very healthy, thick and super shinny... the growth rate wasnt that spectacular however I loved the way my hair came out... I had a 2 months weave and was massaging this oil on my scalp 2ice a week... I had great result. I ordered 2 bottles because of the shipping cost which was half the cost of the products but I kinda regret that decision as I am not too sure if i will repurchase. This product is awesome however the smell is horrible... I sat next to a guy who later asked me what I had in my hair... Yes it&#x27;s that strong not in a good way. If you can get past the fishy smell for the sake of long hair by all means give this product a try. You wont regret it...</li>
    <li> What can I say? Its an awesome product. I discovered that its the only thing I can apply on my face that won&#x27;t make it oily after a couple of hours and so this is what I use for my face. I don&#x27;t even need to use pressed powder or anything anymore to freshen up my face and the best part is its all natural and absorbs so well. Also works great for hair growth!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my face as I had heard it helps with healing and redness.  It feels great on my face, I use is as a moisturizer.  The only down side is the smell.</li>
    <li> I really hate to write this... This product arrived on time but not well packed: the cap was not sealed in any way, the sticker on the bottle was made on a home printer. This tells me that someone just filled the bottle with who knows what and simply sells it on amazon. Nothing on the sticker tells me that this is a reliable company, also there is no contact information on the bottle. I am yet to use the product. I purchased it based on the great reviews. I will update my review and change it after I use it for at least two weeks.</li>
    <li> If you can&#x27;t find a product that cures dry flaky skin, you&#x27;ve got to try this. After just two days I noticed a huge difference, after a week my flaky skin problem along my hairline and forehead was gone.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really have a lot to compare to but I really love this product. I have aging acne prone skin and as far as natural oils go, hemp seed oil has a &#x27;0&#x27; comedogenic rating. I have been pleased with this oil for moisturizing without clogging my pores. It doesn&#x27;t smell the best but what can be expected. I have not been to an airport since using this product so there is no telling if a drug sniffing dog will corner me on my next security line screening! : )</li>
    <li> Good for sensitive skin! Just don&#x27;t overuse it on face.</li>
    <li> Great for over all over body softness.. I keep it by my shower and use it every time afterwards.  Absorbs quickly and applies easily</li>
    <li> I didnt notice any fishy smell.....in fact, it has nearly no smell.  it does soften hair and skin. I will definitely order this again!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice hemp oil, no odor and using just a tiny bit on my face after cleansing makes my skin absolutely glow (and I have terrible, oily skin with large pores!) with no greasiness after several minutes. Hemp oil is useful for a lot of things. Only reason I did not give 5 stars is the bottle is very awkward (top heavy, easy to spill) and there&#x27;s no control spout to pour small amounts. So I just transferred some into a smaller bottle with a snap cap. The price was very reasonable!</li>
    <li> Recently made some lip balm and added this to the mix with excellent results! It has great flavor, not much odor but definitely a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My skin has never felt better!</li>
    <li> I have dry acne prone skin and I read that hemp seed oil is really good for this.  This caused the worst breakouts I have ever had in my life.  I would not recommend at all for skin care.</li>
    <li> I had a small growth on my temple that i had had for a long time. Then it started growing very fast. It was about the size and thickness of a nickel when I started using the oil. I applied oil maybe 4 times a day being sure to really get it rubbed in around the edges. In one and half days I noticed it getting smaller. I told my friend. She said it was my imagination. 2 days later, half of the growth came off in my hand when I was applying oil!!! I was amazed and happy. A few more days and it was down to nothing. And then it was completely gone. Then my friend said &amp;#34;order the same thing for me&amp;#34;!!&lt;br /&gt;I would not believe it if it hadnt happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;I am now using on other splotches on my face. I think it is making a difference but much slower.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I had just seen a dermatologist about the growth and they had me scheduled to come in and have it cut off. No sign now of even where if had been. I am in love with this oil.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m 16 and I used this on a big bump I got a few month&#x27;s after I got my nose ring pierced, I&#x27;m pretty sure it was an infection. But, after a few days of applying the oil to the bump it completely went away. I was happy because the thing the piercer gave to me was supposed to keep it clean and take away and prevent any infection which obviously didn&#x27;t help at all, and the oil instantly started making it shrink. Also, I bought a new bottle to apply to my psoriasis on my legs and arms. I have almost no doubt that it will work. I&#x27;ve read a lot of great reviews on how it makes it go away and my new bottle will be here tomorrow. I also bought the hemp shampoo. :)</li>
    <li> Hemp oil is unbelievable. I am 24 year female, I always had dark dry lips with no life. I never felt my lips soft and non stretchy , they are dry and I really did not feel like they are part of my skin. I used hemp oil for one night my lips became super soft the next morning... on 3rd day the dark color of my lips started fading away. I used many lip balms cheapest to the most expensive nothing made me feel this way ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel i got new pair of lips ... I also apply it to my face. Its working great, I have oily skin but still i use it, it keeps my skin fresh even after I wake up in the morning.  ...&lt;br /&gt;Cold pressed hemp oil works for any skin dry/oily/ comb. trust in nature and buy it ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> This hemp oil is lovely. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent like many of the other hemp oils too. This fragrance is very, very light and nutty, and it fades to no scent within the hour. I use it on my legs and arms after I shower. Provides great moisture and healing to the skin. And 8 oz lasts forever! Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> wonderful product for your skin. I used it on my sunburn and peeling skin and it worked wonders. Love this.</li>
    <li> I use this oil to take off my eye makeup . I  have dry skin. and have been putting a tablespoon in my bath water. I feel my skin is improving.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful oil for acne!!! I use this to cleanse my face and as a moisturiser. I was considering using jojoba oil at first to cleanse my acne prone face. I did some research and found that jojoba oil has a comedogenic rating of 2 which isn&#x27;t horrible, but my skin is super sensitive and easily breaks out. Hemp seed oil has a comedogenic rating of 0 which means it will not clog or block your pores and cause blackheads and acne. I have used this for 4 months and it has been GREAT for my skin. Very happy I decided to try this &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> The price is great. This Hemp seed oil quality is superb.Looking forward to purchasing more in the future. I compared this hemp seed oil to the body shops hemp seed oil. Turns out the Dr.adorable Hemp seed oil did far more for softening for my skin than the body shops \\&quot;hemp oil\\&quot; that contains other carrier ingredients. I am a fan of Body shops though, not a fan of their hemp oil is all.</li>
