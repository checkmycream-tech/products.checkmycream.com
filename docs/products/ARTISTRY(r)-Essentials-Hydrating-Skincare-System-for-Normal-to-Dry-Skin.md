      <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
      <li>I just started using this product but love it so far.  </li>
      <li>My skin is always fresh</li>
      <li>So to me it worth it.</li>
      <li>The price is so worth it.</li>
      <li>I have been using this hydrating set for years, but this is the first time I buy it from Amazon.</li>
      <li>This is my first time trying the hydration and it improved my skin immediately.</li>
      <li>Most of the time, when I open the tube, a lot of cream comes out.</li>
      <li>I love the cleanser and the toner but the moisturizer does not help with people like me who have dry skin.</li>

      <li>This product feels very watery and does not feel like the ones I&#x27;ve purchased from my Amway agent.</li>

      <li>A whole new human being.</li>
      <li>The cleanser(step 1) makes your face feel baby soft, the toner (step 2)removes</li>
      <li>It makes me look young and refreshed.</li>
      <li>it is good , but i don&#x27;t like the cleaner&#x27;s smell ,like a fake.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had bad skin but this product hands down has proven to be EXCELLENT...</li>
      <li>It may work well on normal skin type, but if you have dry skin, this will probably not work for you.</li>
      <li>This system works very well for my 64-year-old dry skin, and it lasts a long time.  </li>

    <li> it is good , but i don&#x27;t like the cleaner&#x27;s smell ,like a fake.</li>
    <li> Absorbed smoothly into skin. Very good esp. in dry season and skin.</li>
    <li> Great value. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this! Hydrates my skin, Cleans at the same time.... My skin looks Much better.. I use this and a acne wash I switch off  using both and rarely breakout!</li>
    <li> Artistry products are always of the best quality. The system is easy to use, the cleanser rinses completely and the cream and toner feel very light. I love it when people tell me I don&#x27;t look close to my 76 years!</li>
    <li> Timely, cost efficient and love the product.</li>
    <li> Artistry is the BEST PRODUCT EVER...I&#x27;ve never had bad skin but this product hands down has proven to be EXCELLENT...My skin is always fresh..looks great..feels great...I am so happy with it and will forever use it.</li>
    <li> Best Skin care treatment I&#x27;ve ever had! I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now and I love it. The price is so worth it. I&#x27;ve tried lots of moisturizers and this is the best. The cleanser(step 1) makes your face feel baby soft, the toner (step 2)removes all the left over junk on your face and the moisturizer(step 3) is heaven! Plus it also has sunscreen so that&#x27;s a plus. 5 stars for sure, your skin will definitely show improvement and love you for it!</li>
    <li> Give this product a try.  This is the only item I buy from Amway.  I am 80 and look years younger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using artistry for a few months and really love their time defiant line, so I decided to give this skin care system a try.  Even though I got the system for normal-to-dry skin, it leaves my skin extremely dry afterward. It may work well on normal skin type, but if you have dry skin, this will probably not work for you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years now. I didn&#x27;t know they had it on Amazon. What a lucky break. Now it is delivered to my door and packaged with care.  This really last you a long time . I have very delicate skin and would recommend this for anybody.</li>
    <li> I just love this facewazh set! It makes my skin feel and look amazing! !! I can&#x27;t wait to try even more products!</li>
    <li> THE BEST FACE PRODUCT I EVER USED. I RECOMMEND TO ALL MY FRIENDS.</li>
    <li> I tried changing what has been working for me and my skin did not appreciate it. I&#x27;ve been using Essentials Balancing Skincare, had to buy it the following week.... Artistry is the best though!!!</li>
    <li> This system works very well for my 64-year-old dry skin, and it lasts a long time.  Also, I avoided the high shipping and handling costs involved if I had ordered it from Amway.</li>
    <li> I love the cleanser and the toner but the moisturizer does not help with people like me who have dry skin.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this product .</li>
    <li> I just started using this product but love it so far.  It makes your skin feel good, really soft.</li>
    <li> I love Artistry products. This is my first time trying the hydration and it improved my skin immediately. The only thing I do not like is that the facial cleanser feels like a lotion rather than soapy. There are no bubbles. I think after this one I&#x27;m sticking to Balance in stead of Hydration.</li>
    <li> I used to purchase Artistry before but they stopped making the face cream which I loved. This was just okay.</li>
    <li> Most of the time, when I open the tube, a lot of cream comes out. Most of the time it gets wasted. I dont know if it&#x27;s Artistry&#x27;s strategy to sell more by wasting more. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> good quality good price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using artistry skincare for almost a year and I love it! my skin keeps hydrated so it&#x27;s not oily and shiny.</li>
    <li> I love this product. My brother brought it for me for christmas about 2 yrs ago. It lasted for almost and a year. The only thing is you have to use it everyday, so you skin won&#x27;t go back to how it looked before. It is good for dry and oily skin. When I have pimps and use it, it goes away. Soon as I go without for a week, I start seeing dry skin and pimps again. So to me it worth it. It makes me look young and refreshed. A whole new human being. I happen to be a woman, and we all love to look beautiful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to practically everything but I don&#x27;t seem to have any reaction to this product and it is easy to use and makes my skin much more smooth textured and even-looking. And no, I don&#x27;t sell Amway! I buy it on Amazon because I like it.</li>
    <li> I really like it so far...I have been using it for about a week now and it seems to work very well. I have combo skin-dry/normal and it works well. The real test will be in the winter though...It is very easy to use and the price was good for what you get.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products throughout the years and was skeptical about another system. I noticed a huge difference in the tone and moisture of my skin just after one use. This system works amazing in keeping my combination skin at the right balance and moisture. Thank you Artistry for making something that works AWESOME!</li>
    <li> I have been using this hydrating set for years, but this is the first time I buy it from Amazon. This product feels very watery and does not feel like the ones I&#x27;ve purchased from my Amway agent. I regret buying from Amazon.. I was trying to save money and instead I received this... not worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Artistry skin care for a number of years. Its the best i&#x27;ve experienced</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Artistry for almost 3 years. It keeps my face moisturized, feeling good and never breaks me out. I also love the smell of the products! It is well worth the price. I will always come back to purchase Artistry Essentials!</li>
