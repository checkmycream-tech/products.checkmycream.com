### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect size for my hair!</li>
      <li>Great price too!</li>
      <li>Great product for the price.</li>
      <li>These are great for clipping it up out of the way.</li>
      <li>Good price.</li>
      <li>All in all, this is a good product for a good price.</li>
      <li>Great for very fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Very cute clips.</li>
      <li>A good size for my fine hair!</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair that I am trying to grow out (doesn&#x27;t quite reach my shoulders yet).</li>
      <li>Perfect size for holding back my short/medium length hair while I style the bottom of my hair.</li>
      <li>you are looking for an easy way to keep your hair up, these work very well!</li>
      <li>extra cheap, it would be better to purchase from a store so that you can see what sort of quality the clips are.</li>
      <li>And the price is right.</li>
      <li>It is not quite large enough to effectively gather the top half of my hair all at once, so I don&#x27;t typically wear them out of the house, but they are great for separating my hair for curling or straightening.  </li>
      <li>The quality is fine, but don&#x27;t expect big clips.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d spend up to four times as much at the pharmacy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>HOwever, they are a good quality for someone who has thick hair to hold them.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very challenging to find clips for super-fine hair that aren&#x27;t humongous and that actually stay put without slipping.</li>
      <li>These are perfect for putting up my fine/thin hair, but I need a slightly bigger size for my daughter&#x27;s long and thick</li>
      <li>In fact, each clip is about 2 inches long, perfect for my jaw-length fine hair, but not ideal for those of you blessed with thick, long tresses.</li>
      <li>Because the product is not shown in its actual size, the clips turned out to be far too big for my wife.</li>

<li> Because the product is not shown in its actual size, the clips turned out to be far too big for my wife.</li>
<li> Five weeks later, I have used only one black clip from the pack of four, and I have used it nearly every day.</li>
<li> These clips were much smaller than expected.  </li>
<li> I have thick hair and these clips are not large enough to secure my hair, there are just too small.  </li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t a have these very long</li>
<li> single handed, but</li>
<li> It&#x27;s still as tight and firm as when it was new.</li>
<li> It take two hands to open the black ones.</li>
<li> The black is true to color, and the brown clips have a very subtle tortoise shell affect.  </li>
<li> but I thought they were a little bigger.</li>
<li> Mine scratch my scalp as the clips are rough on the ends.</li>
<li> I have slightly thicker than average straight/wavy hair and one of these clips can hold about a fourth of my hair.  </li>
<li> feel silly giving such a high rating</li>
<li> One hand to push on the clamp and the other one to pry the comb part away.</li>
<li> I have used these in the past, and recently my daughter showed an interest in putting her hair up with claw clips, so I ordered them on impulse when I ordered a few other things.</li>
<li> Their quality is average.</li>
<li> I like that the black has a matte finish.</li>
<li> The \\&quot;tortoise\\&quot; is the typical shiny brown-on-brown you tend to see in clips of this type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> so I will just have to use it on half the hair when I put it up.</li>
<li> The spring is tight, so the clips do take a bit of work to get into my hair</li>
<li> These clips turned out to be larger than I had expected -- I ordered the wrong item.  </li>
<li> I have been using them for several months and none of the teeth have broken off.  </li>
<li> very small clips i dont recommend them for anyone with long hair or thick hair it doest stay in it says</li>
<li> but the are small</li>
<li> Clips were too small, being labelled medium</li>
<li> VERY SMALL CLIPS.</li>
<li> All I have to say is crap</li>

    <li> Pictures are deceiving. VERY SMALL CLIPS.</li>
    <li> Great for very fine hair.  Good price.</li>
    <li> Very cute clips. Great price too!</li>
    <li> These fellows are HUGE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t read the titles for reviews.  I read the reviews.</li>
    <li> Clips were too small, being labelled medium I thought they would be bigger than this. They don&#x27;t hold up all my hair..</li>
    <li> Because the product is not shown in its actual size, the clips turned out to be far too big for my wife.</li>
    <li> These clips were much smaller than expected.  Definitely smaller than the dimensions provided.  The quality is fine, but don&#x27;t expect big clips.</li>
    <li> All I have to say is crap I didn&#x27;t a have these very long the combs snapped off the metal holding the clipp together was flimsy! Junk!</li>
    <li> These arrived on time and were well packaged.  These are medium-small I would say, along the lines of this type of clip.  I have slightly thicker than average straight/wavy hair and one of these clips can hold about a fourth of my hair.  It is not quite large enough to effectively gather the top half of my hair all at once, so I don&#x27;t typically wear them out of the house, but they are great for separating my hair for curling or straightening.  I have been using them for several months and none of the teeth have broken off.  The finish on these clips is matte.  The black is true to color, and the brown clips have a very subtle tortoise shell affect.  All in all, this is a good product for a good price.</li>
    <li> I have used these in the past, and recently my daughter showed an interest in putting her hair up with claw clips, so I ordered them on impulse when I ordered a few other things. These are perfect for putting up my fine/thin hair, but I need a slightly bigger size for my daughter&#x27;s long and thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an easy way to keep your hair up, these work very well!</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my hair!</li>
    <li> I know these say they are medium but I thought they were a little bigger. I have a lot of hair so I will just have to use it on half the hair when I put it up.</li>
    <li> The product dimensions given (3.5 x 7 x 1 inches) are for the cardboard packaging these clips come in. In fact, each clip is about 2 inches long, perfect for my jaw-length fine hair, but not ideal for those of you blessed with thick, long tresses. The spring is tight, so the clips do take a bit of work to get into my hair single handed, but once in, they hold everything in place quite snugly. I like that the black has a matte finish. The \\&quot;tortoise\\&quot; is the typical shiny brown-on-brown you tend to see in clips of this type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel silly giving such a high rating--it&#x27;s just a plastic clamp--but it&#x27;s very challenging to find clips for super-fine hair that aren&#x27;t humongous and that actually stay put without slipping. And the price is right. I&#x27;d spend up to four times as much at the pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: January 8, 2014. Five weeks later, I have used only one black clip from the pack of four, and I have used it nearly every day. It&#x27;s still as tight and firm as when it was new.</li>

    <li> very small clips i dont recommend them for anyone with long hair or thick hair it doest stay in it says med but the are small i wish i hadnt bought them</li>
    <li> It take two hands to open the black ones. One hand to push on the clamp and the other one to pry the comb part away. When I did put it in my hair to see if it would hold, it got stuck.</li>
