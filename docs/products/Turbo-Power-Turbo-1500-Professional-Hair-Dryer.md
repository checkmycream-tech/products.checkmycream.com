    <li> Dryer is very loud and it broke down after 6 months of usage... will not recommend it to other buyers.</li>
    <li> I had this blow dryer for 14 YEARS!!!!!! I definitely had no complaints. but, last night it gave up on me...Turbo 1500 gave me more than enough years. When i purchased this Item back in 1999  it cost $60.00 but, it sure was worth it.....  R.I.P Turbo 1500 lol</li>
    <li> It is simply the best money can buy,especially if your hair is coarse.The heat this thing kicks out is great for straightening hair.Fantastic!!</li>
    <li> my all time favorite dryer in life..&lt;br /&gt;light weight powerful quick drying time&lt;br /&gt;hand made in Italy ...a must have</li>
    <li> Excellent, what we wanted and more.</li>
    <li> I was trying to find a better blow dryer than the regular you get in the store ($20), but this one does not have so much different and also is really really hot.</li>
    <li> Love love this hair dryer. My first time to own a Turbo Power but should have been buying for years. Live and learn!&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine, thin, hair and all my other dryers have been to harsh on my fragile locks with 1875 watts. After researching the best for my hair issues - the lower wattage, 1500,  is perfect and dries my hair beautifully, smooth and shinny. This dryer is also very substantial in motor which is important to me so it will last.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. ... this a replacement for another turbo that I bought 15 years ago , and I used almost every day of the week... I won&#x27;t buy any other hair dryer. ...</li>
    <li> I argued with my lady about buying this hair dryer. I told her there were others, others less expensive, that would do the job. It is after all just  drying hair. After buying and trashing a Conair I finally bought her this Turbo Power dryer. THe complants stopped, the dryer still works and I am her hero. The rewards were worth the investment.</li>
    <li> This is an OK hair dryer.  It is durable and the material is quality.  It did not get as hot as I would like.  My hair is thick and long and it needs heat to really give it a smooth silky look.  I don&#x27;t like to use a flat iron after I blow my hair, so I rely on the dryer to do all of my hair straightening.  This dryer will straighten it but the roots look a little puffy.  I&#x27;ve had the dryer for a couple of months now and am considering buying a new drier with higher watts.  After doing a little research on the internet, I found that the higher the watts the hotter it dryer.  The Turbo Power 1500 is only 1300 watts and other dryers like the Twin Turbo 2800 or Twin Turbo 3200 watts are around 1800.  Bottom line, if you have fine hair this is a good drier. If you&#x27;re going to use something like a flat iron after you blow dry your hair, then this is a good dryer.  If your hair is thick and/or coarse and you&#x27;re looking for this dryer to really straighten your hair, then you&#x27;re going to have to spend more for a dryer with higher watts.</li>
    <li> I did research before purchasing and I am very disappointed. Wish I had saved the packaging so I can return. Not hot enough for my fine hair that needs a decent amount of heat to hold any kind of style. My last Revlon dryer that I spend less than $30 on was better than this. After about 6 years it stopped working. I decided to invest in a professional dryer because friends had raved what a difference it makes and that it&#x27;s worth the investment. I believe them, this is just not the dryer that backs up that statement.</li>
    <li> I am convinced that you need a great product to be able to straighten your hair out and have it look great.  This blow dryer has made all the differece in how fast and nice my hair blows dries straightening out!</li>
    <li> My old turbo 1500 blow dryer stop working after 15 years is the best you can buy I love it and is the only one i ever buy againg and againg.</li>
    <li> I had the same blow dryer for many, many years before it finally stopped working properly.  It is such a great product that I had to get another one!  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This dryer is absolutely wonderful.  My hair has never been so straight.</li>
    <li> My mother bought this dryer about 15 years ago and the dryer is still working just fine. This dryer has been used every other day if not everyday for the last 15 years. 100% recommended.</li>
    <li> It was ordered for a friend whose wife runs a beauty shop and he says it working fine</li>
    <li> Wonderfull, very light and very powerful.  My hair looks shiny and smooth. This hair dryer is used by the professional salons and even with my little expertise it works like a charm. Love ittt.</li>
    <li> I had to replace my 8 year old Turbo Power and didn&#x27;t even consider purchasing a different brand. It dries and straightens my very curly hairy in no time with salon quality.</li>
    <li> I place my order on Wednesday September 1st and I was shocked that I already got it today September 4th; I am very pleased with them because I need it the item right away and I got it without paying extra money for rush delivery.  I won&#x27;t think twice to buy again from them and I Would definately recomend them to everybody.  Excellent Packing and professionally well done.   TWO THUMBS UP AND FIVE STARS.</li>
    <li> I am old school beautician, this is the best blow dryer you can own.  i am happy after so many years i can still find this.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift and my wife absolutely loves it. She says its the best hair dryer she has ever had. And I cant complain about the price. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> the is one of the best blow dryer ever, i lov it i would recomended it to everyone...try it you too will love it!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this blow dryer, bought mines in the store though in NYC in washington heights but I lost the front piece to make my hair straight. Anyone knows where I can possibly just buy that part?</li>
    <li> It let my hair so nice and without freeze!!!!! im so sad that i drop mine by mistake after 3 years that i have it with me, but ill defenetly buy it again!!!</li>
    <li> I have really rebel wavy hair and my mom got this as a gift 10 yrs ago. We both used it. She gave it to me abt 4/5 yrs and honestly it sooo good. It leaves ur hair sleek and shiny (depending how good you take care of your hair). Anyway just recently it makes this weird sound and it smells kindda bad haha but i cant complain. I just need a new one after 10 yrs.</li>
    <li> does it comes with the front piece? I want to make sure before i purchase this dryer. It had happend before to me</li>
    <li> All I can say about this hair dryer is that my wife loves it. I purchased the very same one around 5 years ago. Well, it finally died, but since it was so good, I purchased another one for my wife. She says that it works faster than others she had before, that is comfortable to hold and obviously it last for a very long time. She highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Mi pelo es ondulado y necesita mucho calor para alizarlo...Este secador es simplemente PERFECTO para alizar el cabello!!Los resultados son como en el beauty salon..Definitivamente la mejor invesion que he hecho en mi pelo!!Vale cada centavo!!Me encanta!!</li>
    <li> Another device that is a powerhouse in a small package.  I had a very expensive white designer hairdresser before this and it still took forever to dry hair, and got so hot doing so that kids and pets yowl.  This dryer works in record time, blows the moisture out like those car dryer things at the car wash, and doesn&#x27;t burn hair or scalp doing so.  It is also fairly quiet for the power.  I am not a pro hairdresser so can&#x27;t speak for that, but for the family bath night, it is fast without the  furious.</li>
    <li> Best dryer I&#x27;ve had, this is my second one...the first one I had just burned out after 17 years that I&#x27;ve had it! Cant ask for more</li>
    <li> my wife love it , Thank you fo your fast shipping.</li>
    <li> this is the perfect item my wife was looking for but it took the person over two weeks to get it to us not cool not cool at all had to buy one locally</li>
    <li> with short hair works amazing....with long hair...just get ready for your arms workout....</li>
    <li> Love this!! I purchased before from a store and lasted for a long period of time. I would recommend this to everybody!</li>
    <li> i love the turbo blow dryer its the best the price is totally woth buying :-D it works wonders :-)</li>
    <li> Lightweight, Quiet (and lower frequency sound than other dryers - better for your ears), powerful, and multiple (appropriate) cool/heat settings.&lt;br /&gt;A clear winner...FINALLY!  My wife has been ecstatic with it for a year now.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to buy another to put in one of the guest rooms (as a back-up).</li>
    <li> Great product. It dries my hair super fast. A friend of mine has had hers for years and I am hoping to as well!</li>
    <li> I have been researching hair dryers and came upon this dryer which my mother owns (and I still borrow).  I&#x27;m looking to buy my own for convenience. My mother originally bought this dryer because it was used in a lot of Dominican salons and the fact that she&#x27;s had it over 10 years I think speaks for itself. We didn&#x27;t buy it on Amazon but, at a local beauty supply for about $60 then.  I wanted to leave a review because I felt that a lot of reviews I&#x27;ve seen for different dryers were left by people with hair types that could be dried well even without a hair dryer. Not so for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair:&lt;br /&gt;- Thick&lt;br /&gt;- Coarse&lt;br /&gt;- Long (past the middle of my back)&lt;br /&gt;- Dominican (if that helps)&lt;br /&gt;- Cannot air dry it (it would dry very puffy and frizzy if so)&lt;br /&gt;- Has been relaxed (I relax it 2-4 times a year)&lt;br /&gt;- Retains water (humid weather wreaks havoc)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What seems to be most people&#x27;s hair types in hair dryer reviews overall (not just this one):&lt;br /&gt;- Able to dry with minimal effort (no brushing or able to point the dryer generally and have their hair still dry straight)&lt;br /&gt;- Hair that can dry in 5-20 minutes with minimal effort&lt;br /&gt;- \\&quot;Thick\\&quot; (though I think some people are confused as to their actual hair type)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to learn that this hair dryer is only 1300 watts. After reading many dryer reviews, I thought I&#x27;d need something that was 2000 watts. Now, I&#x27;m rethinking that because this still does a good job at 1300. I think some people who leave dryer reviews don&#x27;t know their actual hair type and/or how to properly blow dry their hair for a smooth, lasting, straight finish. Sometimes it&#x27;s not the dryer&#x27;s fault but, HOW people attempt to dry their hair. My mother does hair very well (if you&#x27;ve ever gone to a Dominican salon, you know that Dominican salons tend to do hair well). Some people at other salons tend to dry all hair types as if they are the same and dry the same and that isn&#x27;t the case, leaving me (or others Iknow with similar hair) with terrible results. These have been my experiences and obviously don&#x27;t apply to everyone. I don&#x27;t like going to salons and haven&#x27;t gone in years. Using this dryer, I have always received compliments on how nice and straight my hair looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried to do my own hair (without really knowing how to) using someone&#x27;s John Frieda 1875 watt hair dryer. I did a horrible job that took me a very long time and ended with puffy hair, not smooth at all but at least dry. If you don&#x27;t use a blow dryer on a hot enough setting, it will not dry well, it only gets the water out of your hair is all. My mother, using the same dryer, did a much better job similar to the results with this dryer.  You have to use a brush of some type (round or straight) to pull and straighten the hair for a smooth finish.  You should also dry only small sections at a time for better results and always point the dryer down and in the direction of the hair shaft using the concentrator nozzle. I use a thermal protector as well as other products for shine so, I can&#x27;t comment on the dryer&#x27;s efficacy on those things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS about this dryer:&lt;br /&gt;- Takes my hair only about 40 minutes to fully dry (after just squeezing out excess water with a towel, parting, clipping and drying small sections at a time. Compare this to salons where I have to sit under a hooded dryer for well over an hour and have them still blow dry my hair straight after, which takes another 20 minutes or so for a total of almost two hours.)&lt;br /&gt;- Dries smoothly and straightens well (no need to use a flat iron after)&lt;br /&gt;- Gets very hot&lt;br /&gt;- Strong air flow&lt;br /&gt;- Good weight (not too heavy)&lt;br /&gt;- Buttons are well placed (don&#x27;t accidentally press anything)&lt;br /&gt;- Long cord length (Haven&#x27;t measured it exactly but, it is at least 6 feet, probably more and has never been an issue)&lt;br /&gt;- Removable filter (can easily clean for a longer life)&lt;br /&gt;- Durable (has been owned for at least 10years and still works well, using it several times a week on 2-3 people with similar hair types to my own)&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with a concentrator nozzle (Stays put and after years of accidental drops has never broken)&lt;br /&gt;- Could go for up to a week without having to redo hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Brand name rubbed off after many years (I don&#x27;t care but, may be a con for some)&lt;br /&gt;- Gets very hot (have to protect my ears sometimes and cannot leave it close to my scalp for long. Good that it gets that hot but, you have to be careful so it&#x27;s a pro and con)&lt;br /&gt;- Loud (I think most dryers are. In terms of hearing conservation, I would recommend using ear plugs with dryers since they are so close to your head/ears and are very loud for a long period of time. This could eventually result in some amount of noise-induced hearing loss. Not specifically with just this dryer but, any dryer.)&lt;br /&gt;- Only has a hot and cool setting (each with different strengths. The cool setting isn&#x27;t that cool, it is warm although I&#x27;ve only used it after using hot for over 30 minutes. This is only a con if you&#x27;re looking for a dryer with a cool shot.)&lt;br /&gt;- Somewhat expensive (there are many dryers available for half this price so it is an investment)&lt;br /&gt;- Not compact (If you&#x27;re looking for something like that. I have had bad experiences with hotel dryers that leave my hair a big puffy mess so I will still pack and use this, even though it is a full size hair dryer. It&#x27;s that good.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product but, I am not personally buying it for myself because it is over my budget. I am looking for a dryer that is less than $40-50 and available through prime. This dryer is not available with prime shipping and the beauty supply store has jacked up the price over the years. If you can afford to spend that amount on a dryer, it is a good investment. I&#x27;d prefer not to if I can find something that works as well as this one for less money. If I do find something like that, I will definitely share that (I&#x27;m researching and will try) but, at least I have this dryer as a backup if anything.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product but within 3 months -- used only 2 per week at most during the winter -- it had broken.  It was clearly a defective product.  Could not get a replacement with Amazon.  Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> I would return this but it&#x27;s been too long. I almost immediately went back to my old dryer after a couple of times. I have since found another dryer on Amazon that I just received and it&#x27;s doing a wonderful job.</li>
