      <li>and I was impressed.</li>
      <li>Great job!</li>
      <li>understand users&#x27; frustration with the lack of package instructions on Shea Moisture products, but I think the manufacturer believes in the product&#x27;s versatility - and allows buyers to apply it to their best advantage.  </li>
      <li>a try, at best it will stop your hair breakage.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just perfect for the type and texture of hair I have.</li>
      <li>to the product, it is great!</li>

      <li>To help soften my hair and make detangling easier (this does not have very good slip)</li>

      <li>I also noticed that my hair has stopped breaking; which is always a great thing.</li>
      <li>I also use this masque as a detangler as it has great slip.  </li>
      <li>It is amazing!</li>
      <li>I liked!  </li>
      <li>Also I almost never complain about smell, but this product wreaks of mens colonge, which isn&#x27;t very pleasant when I have to sit with this on top of my head for 15-30 minutes under a hooded dryer.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know my hair could be so shiny and smell so good,</li>
      <li>two uses, my hair still doesn&#x27;t feel good after washing it out</li>
      <li>so the likelihood of my repurchase is good.</li>
      <li>Over night is good to.</li>
      <li>Great job, I will use this mask once a week, and maybe try more in this product line.</li>
      <li>My curls are more defined and my hair feels great after using this masque.</li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>and I totally love it!</li>

      <li>It also smells amazing.  </li>
      <li>but I still see amazing results.</li>

      <li>The whole line smells great!</li>
      <li>It has a nice fragrance to it as well</li>
      <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s still worth it at this price, it&#x27;s a great product</li>
      <li>It works great for me with keeping the right moisture level.</li>
      <li>I am Caucasian and have very fine, brittle hair.  </li>
      <li>It keeps it from breaking and it makes it strong and volumous!</li>
      <li>It leaves my tress very shiny, full of volume, and it smells wonderful.</li>
      <li>I love this masque.</li>
      <li>u have an hour or more to leave it on or else your just wasting your money.</li>
      <li>I love how it softens and moisturizes my hair.</li>
      <li>Pleased</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried this masque.</li>
      <li>Used more than once</li>
      <li>The ends of my hair also look much better as well.</li>
      <li>I have to say after three uses, my hair looks so much better.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have that problem any more since I started using this product.</li>
      <li>The slip while damp feels healthy again.</li>
      <li>When touching my hair I can feel that there is something on it, but it is not oily at all.  </li>
      <li>but then again, I don&#x27;t believe most product claims</li>
      <li>love it on the frizzy ends, locks in moisture.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I love this product, it works wonders for my 3a/b hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lastly, I did not add ANY MORE PRODUCTS because I wanted to see the results.</li>
      <li>When I use the masque, my husband rubs up to me more to get a sniff.</li>
      <li>Talk about sexy in a bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve tried so many products over the years).</li>
      <li>It is a light protein treatment, vegetable protein is about the 10th ingredient, so it can be ok for weekly use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also available on line at Shea Moisture&#x27;s site, Curlmart &amp; Walgreens online (the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for this product is $12).f</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also available on line at Shea Moisture&#x27;s site, Curlmart &amp; Walgreens online (the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for this product is $12).</li>
      <li>It smells strongly of flowers.</li>
      <li>It has a really strong floral-perfume scent that lingers even after you wash it out.</li>
      <li>When I first tried this stuff on clean hair it caused me to experience breakage that took me 4 or so months to overcome!!</li>
      <li>I love it, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>but it does work well for me as a pre-poo &amp; light protein DC which helps prep my hair for cleansing &amp; styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not only does it smell great</li>
      <li>Smells good and keeps my hair soft.</li>
      <li>I love how my hair felt after  I straightened my hair(it&#x27;s very curly and f rizzy) but this Left my hair very smooth, shiny, with a nice scent.</li>
      <li>but I liked how natural it was</li>
      <li>Buyer beware this is a true rip off.</li>
      <li>I use it under my Huetiful steamer and let it cool off before rinsing with tepid water.  </li>
      <li>It does not provide adequate moisture.</li>
      <li>This was shipped out quite quickly</li>
      <li>I am almost out and will definitely be purchasing some more again!</li>
      <li>I have fine straight hair with lots of color and damage.</li>
      <li>When I wash this deep conditioner out of my hair it feels amazing.</li>
      <li>It was because of that that I was able to get my hair to feel soft again.</li>
      <li>This one will surprise you and it is definitely worth the money.  </li>
      <li>This masque goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly into my curly hair leaving it soft and shiny and feeling stronger.</li>
      <li>Curl definition was incredible, no frizz and soft to the touch, although, not as soft  as when I use the SM  Deep Conditioning Masque.  </li>
      <li>it feels soft and strong again.</li>
      <li>I first bought this in the suburbs for $12 at Walgreens.</li>
      <li>In conditioner next :-)</li>
      <li>Love this deep conditioner.</li>
      <li>The first day I used it my co-workers noticed a boost in shine.</li>
      <li>I bought this, and the first day I used it</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I wanted for my hair.</li>
      <li>because penetrating the hair shaft with the vitamin will ultimately help prevent more breakage.</li>
      <li>I even thought about leaving it on my hair for my next wash. :)</li>
      <li>I tried it once as a protein treatment before perming my hair, which resulted in ironically more breakage than prior to applying the treatment, drier, duller looking hair.</li>
      <li>I really felt moisture and cleansing improving in my hair with this product!</li>
      <li>The two together do a fantastic job of cleansing my hair and leaving it soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>Applied first thing in shower, combed thru, did my business and shampooed it out.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product received was not the advertised product.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations! It made my hair very soft and manageable, it put moisturize and healthiness back where it was lost! Excellent product, so good I have already told others of this product! Great job!</li>
    <li> For me, I do not use it alone, I just mix a little with another moisturizing conditioner, I have a feeling it would be way too much protein used alone and will harden my hair. So far so good, just a tea spoon to complement other masks.</li>
    <li> After trying Shea moisture&#x27;s  other mask, the raw shea butter moisture masque, I was skeptical on trying another mask since I was not pleased on how that one left my hair.But this one caught my eye since it says anti breakage and my hair breaks alot.I left it in for 30 mins under a dryer. . I love how my hair felt after  I straightened my hair(it&#x27;s very curly and f rizzy) but this Left my hair very smooth, shiny, with a nice scent.</li>
    <li> I product is great I use it on my Daughter and my hair also as a deep conditioner. I was disappointed on how the product arrived though. The outside of the container was very dirty and when I opened the product the safety seal was already opened. It seemed as if they sent me a product that someone had used and returned or it was sitting there for a long time.</li>
    <li> Immediately after the first use my 4c hair appeared thicker.  I used it in combination with the Yucca and Baobab Thickening Growth Milk.  After the second use, my hair was actually thicker and stronger, so I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens with continual use.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to try it if you have used other volumizing products  that didn&#x27;t work at all.This one will surprise you and it is definitely worth the money.  Pick it up at Walgreen&#x27;s and save yourself $3- $4. I also recommend the Thickening Moisture Mist.  I didn&#x27;t buy the shampoo as I understand the formula has changed.  This works well  with the Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Moisture Retention Shampoo.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it very often, but once I tried it I really felt moisture and cleansing improving in my hair with this product!</li>
    <li> I have thick natural  hair 4b/c texture. I use this as a moisture treatment between my wash day. It works great for me with keeping the right moisture level.</li>
    <li> I bought this masque primarily to use it as a pre-shampoo treatment seeing that the third ingredient is coconut oil(a penetrating oil.)I had also hoped that the claims to improve split ends (which i have A LOT of:()moisturize, control &amp; boost shine would hold some weight.Every aspect listed above passed the test with the exceptions of the shine and split ends, didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in those two areas.The smell is not the best but tolerable.It is a very thick cream(as you will see in the picture below) so if you have fine hair it will probably weigh it down.Likewise, if your hair is prone to build up exercise caution. I have found this to be a very multipurpose product (pre-poo, deep conditioner, leave-in conditioner) so the likelihood of my repurchase is good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair masque for 8 months. The first day I used it my co-workers noticed a boost in shine. I have fine straight hair with lots of color and damage. I no-heat curl it almost every day. The masque does not keep my hair straighter like other products. I used this masque while trying to grow my hair longer. It didn&#x27;t work well with split ends. The slip factor was non-existent. I just had my hair cut and I can&#x27;t believe the difference. I air dry while finger and wide tooth combing (flat wrapping). The slip while damp feels healthy again. It is softer than ever when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is the smell. The masque smells very fragrant in a natural way. It gives me an aromatherapy feeling when I use it. It doesn&#x27;t smell cheap or fake like a lot of other products that claim to be great. When I use the masque, my husband rubs up to me more to get a sniff. Talk about sexy in a bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the label! I first bought this in the suburbs for $12 at Walgreens. I found it on a competitor&#x27;s site for the same price. The problem was that a batch has gone out that contains cilantro instead of the biotin. I saw the biotin version at Walgreens a few days ago. I am so relieved. The cilantro version seems to work just as well, but I can&#x27;t wait to go back to the biotin version because penetrating the hair shaft with the vitamin will ultimately help prevent more breakage. I&#x27;m glad I tried this masque. It was exactly what I wanted for my hair. I didn&#x27;t know my hair could be so shiny and smell so good, even days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To keep my hair from getting used to the product, I only wash it 2 times in a row with the masque. The 3rd wash I switch up with super pricey Joico or Suave Naturals. Due to dandruff/product build up on my scalp, I am also using the African Black Soap shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love this deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have healthy, thick coily hair. Never had any major issues with it. When I first tried this stuff on clean hair it caused me to experience breakage that took me 4 or so months to overcome!! I used it as a DC for 30 minutes! I believe it is the proteins in the conditioner. I may just be too sensitive to them? It was the only new product to my regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It retails $9.99 at Target or similar stores. I returned it after my horrible experience, and because of that I will never try any other green Shea Mositure product  ever again.</li>
    <li> I love this! Hydrated my hair and I can actually feel and see it strengthening after only a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;My  hair has become noticeably softer and easier to manage.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely something I&#x27;d recommend!</li>
    <li> So I bought this product and have had it for a few weeks now. It does not provide adequate moisture. I have short kinky hair and for some reason this does nothing but dry my hair out causing more breakage. This product is not worth the money it does not help with breakage .</li>
    <li> Shea Moisture Organic Yucca &amp; Baobab Anti-Breakage Masque ~ I keep this masque in my &amp;#34;stash&amp;#34; as my once per month DC protein treatment.  I learned early in my natural hair journey that my hair does not like too much protein and this product gives me just enough of a protein hit each month to keep my hair balanced.  I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 2 years and usually grab 2 jars from Walgreens when they have a BOGO sale.  The masque has a very thick almost cottage cheese consistency but I&#x27;m able to easily work it through dry, damp or wet hair; it also has a very interesting earthy/floral fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger too long after I&#x27;ve rinsed it out.  Also this masque has absolutely NO SLIP so cannot be used to detangle hair (well some can try but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it).  I usually leave it on for no longer than 45 minutes under a Hot Head or conditioning cap/towel before rinsing it out with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair feeling &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; which some may call hard but this is how my hair feels after I&#x27;ve used any deep conditioner that contains low levels of protein ingredients.  I then follow up with a moisturizing conditioner that contains no proteins which helps restore softness to my hair and allows me to detangle.  I haven&#x27;t noticed that it helps with breakage or thickening my hair but then again, I don&#x27;t believe most product claims but it does work well for me as a pre-poo &amp; light protein DC which helps prep my hair for cleansing &amp; styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the oh, so enlightened reviewer who stated that this product must be for &amp;#34;coarse African-American hair&amp;#34; ~ Girl, bye.  Coarse hair is not exclusive to Black people.  You should do some ingredient research and learn what ingredients YOUR hair likes or dislikes before you make such ignorant statements. If your hair is very protein-sensitive then the least amount of protein in a product will cause your hair to freak out &amp; if you don&#x27;t know how to treat your hair after you&#x27;ve put protein on it, then of course it felt hard &amp; dry.  I am a Black woman and have used Herbal Essence&#x27;s Long Term Relationship conditioner and my hair reacted to that conditioner exactly the same as this one...want to know why?  Duh, because both contain protein ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also suggest to those who want to try this product that you check Walgreens, Target &amp; CVS first, it has recently been difficult for me to find this particular masque on the ground though but of those 3 stores, a Walgreens near my home continues to stock it.  It&#x27;s also available on line at Shea Moisture&#x27;s site, Curlmart &amp; Walgreens online (the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for this product is $12).f course it felt hard &amp; dry.

    <li> I have a perm on long Indian hair. I used this product once, I wish I sent it back but I kept it too long now it&#x27;s just takes up space. I&#x27;ll eventually throw it out. It dried out my hair, there must be alcohol in this product. It&#x27;s the worst.</li>
    <li> use this everyday on my natural african american kinky hair. love it on the frizzy ends, locks in moisture. i  use this instead of edge control sometimes at night, and tie it down with scarf before bed. when i wake up my bun is smoothed back and frizzes are are tamed!</li>
    <li> This stuff if awful! It made my hair so dry and not soft at all. I have naturally curly, frizzy hair. I don&#x27;t know if this is supposed to be for African American coarse hair that I don&#x27;t have. I have tried another Shea moisture conditioner and it dried my hair out as well.</li>
    <li> Well, this product for one smells delightful. I love how it softens and moisturizes my hair. Also, I can even style my hair and it aides in defining my curls when I rock my twist-outs. SheaMoisture is the bomb diggity!!!</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, but fine hair, with a trace of wave. Because I frequently use demi-haircolors, I want to keep the hair as healthy and shiny as possible. I massage it on generously from scalp to ends and leave on all night. The next day after I rinse it out, their hair is super shiny, but has the little oomph of volume. It&#x27;s just perfect for the type and texture of hair I have. They stopped carrying this at CVS, so I order it here now.</li>
    <li> since I have a protective style in I use this as a thick leave in cream and it leaves my hair very moisturized as well as strengthened.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot and even bought one for my sister. It made my hair feel silky! Pleased</li>
    <li> I love this masque. It is white in color and it is a nice, thick consistency. This masque goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly into my curly hair leaving it soft and shiny and feeling stronger. It has a nice fragrance to it as well and I am going to use this product for a long time to come. I leave it on my hair for about 30 minutes then wash off following my normal routine.  My curls are more defined and my hair feels great after using this masque. I also use this masque as a detangler as it has great slip.  This is definitely my go to masque. It has no sulfates and parabens and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. This was shipped out quite quickly and I received it on the expected delivery date.  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey.</li>
    <li> I prepoo with JBCO. Wash my scalp veryyy gently with shampoo Mizani because didn&#x27;t buy the shampoo yet. I then applied the Shea Moisture masque finger detangle most of my hair, without stressing my tresses, twisted and under my Heutiful&#x27;  steamer.&lt;br /&gt;While in the shower, I rinse the maque and apply a small amount of the conditioner for about 3 min.&lt;br /&gt;Dry my hair with a t shirt an apply a dime size of the milk leave in. Before twisting I spray my hair roots with the mist. So far, I cannot complain at all. I have a 3b 3c thin, fine, very porous hair and this set of products did them for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue using this products. I understand that the purpose of these particular products is to create volume, while restoring the moisture and breakage. I&#x27;m going for it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I did not add ANY MORE PRODUCTS because I wanted to see the results. Very moist, Not Heavy at all! The smell fades away, and since I don&#x27;t manipulate my strands when twist were dry I styled as usually.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck with these line! I liked!  Not heavy, weigh down nor greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I discovered that with the masque and the other products A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!!!&lt;br /&gt;Happy shea moisture shopping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wait, go to Walgreens,Target or other stores. The line is very expensive here in Amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> This helps my hair so much! It keeps it from breaking and it makes it strong and volumous! Love it</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes me hair feel! I put it on before I get in the shower then I put my hair up and let the heat steam it all up! then I was it out and shampoo and condition! It is amazing! And I love the smell! I am really into the Shea Moisture brand (I only found out about it a few months ago) and it is a life saver! The whole line smells great! Don&#x27;t stop at the anti-breakage mask! TRY IT ALL! I haven&#x27;t tried it all- but I will!</li>
    <li> First - let me state the product can be purchased at a much lower price from other vendors.  Do a price comparison before buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand users&#x27; frustration with the lack of package instructions on Shea Moisture products, but I think the manufacturer believes in the product&#x27;s versatility - and allows buyers to apply it to their best advantage.  As those on their natural hair journey can attest no two heads of hair are alike.  Read blogs and reviews, try it as a leave in, a cream rinse, a deep conditioner, whatever.  If you truly like the product, you will stick with it and reap the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have African American kinky coily hair (4c using the Andre Walker method; L-O-cottony using the L.O.I.S. method). I love the Anti-Breakage masque and use it once or twice monthly in my deep conditioning regimen.  I use it under my Huetiful steamer and let it cool off before rinsing with tepid water.  It&#x27;s got enough &#x27;SLIP&#x27; allowing me to effectively detangle my hair prior to rinsing it out.  It&#x27;s inexpensive enough to apply liberally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Anti-Breakage masque leaves my hair with MORE tensile strength, effectively reducing breakage!  I air dry my hair afterwards.  I cannot attest to the Anti-Breakage Masque&#x27;s moisturizing capability since my hair has always had a coarse texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, at best it will stop your hair breakage.  If you don&#x27;t like it, you&#x27;ve only wasted ten dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HTH</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I had a noticeable decrease of hair falling out when I wash it. The ends of my hair also look much better as well.</li>
    <li> I am Caucasian and have very fine, brittle hair.  This mask, along with the shampoo, conditioner and growth milk seem to work well with my hair even though my hair usually gets weighed down easily with other products.  A small amount goes a long way, and while I don&#x27;t think my hair looks much fuller, I do notice that my hair looks heathlier/softer and that makes me happy with the product (I also like the the product is organic and doesn&#x27;t contain Sodium Laurel Sulfate).  I couldn&#x27;t find these products at Target or Walgreens, so I am happy with my purchase, though I know the products have been noted to be less expensive buying them from the aforementioned stores.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it works wonders for my 3a/b hair. It leaves my tress very shiny, full of volume, and it smells wonderful. I also noticed that my hair has stopped breaking; which is always a great thing. I am almost out and will definitely be purchasing some more again! Bravo Shea Moisture!!!</li>
    <li> It hydrates my hair well. But its a lil bit too tick to use. I dilute it a bit with water on my hand before applying it.</li>
    <li> Smells good and keeps my hair soft. It&#x27;s not a miracle product but gets the job done. I also use the shampoo. Been using both for about a year and my hair does seem fuller and less breakage.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other ways to use this products but I love how it moisturizes and softens my hair. It&#x27;s even manageable once I rinsed it out. I even thought about leaving it on my hair for my next wash. :)</li>
    <li> So I purchased this product at my local Target; yes, it costs a lot less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time  last night.  I used tis product for styling purposes this time.  On damp, clean, conditioned, sectioned hair, I applied this product along with a tiny bit of SM Souffle.  Then, I did two strand twists all over my head.  After my hair was dry, twist out.  Curl definition was incredible, no frizz and soft to the touch, although, not as soft  as when I use the SM  Deep Conditioning Masque.  The  product is not oily nor did my hair look dull.  Lot&#x27;s of  bounce, and movement.  When touching my hair I can feel that there is something on it, but it is not oily at all.  The texture and smell of this product is very similar to body lotion right out of the jar.  I like this product and will repurchase, if for nothing else, the curl definition.  I plan to try it as a deep-conditioner and co-wash next.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m AA with Natural 4a type hair. I purchased this product to try as a leave in so I whipped up a small batch of \\&quot;Kimmytube\\&quot; recipe and swapped the masque in place of my regular conditioner and I REALLY like this mix!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can mix and match whatever oils you want but this is the mix I use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 ounce- Shea Mositure Hair Masque&lt;br /&gt;2 tablespoons - Whole leaf  Aloe Vera Juice&lt;br /&gt;2 teaspoons - EVOO (extra virgin olive oil)&lt;br /&gt;1 teaspoon - Black castor oil&lt;br /&gt;1 teaspoon - Tea tree oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**ONE LAST THING**  This item can be found in Target, Duane Reade, Walmart or Walgreens for $10 or less!</li>
    <li> It took a few uses of this product for me to really like it and even then I&#x27;m still on the fence. Its a really nice thick conditioner and a little bit goes a long way, you can probably get about 4-5 uses out of it. That doesn&#x27;t seem like much but depending on how often you want to use it, you can make it last. It is a light protein treatment, vegetable protein is about the 10th ingredient, so it can be ok for weekly use. But I have slightly protein sensitive hair so I spread it out every 3 weeks or so and I also add EVOO to the mix for added moisture, then sit under a heat cap for about 30 minutes. The first time I tried it, my hair was left stripped, dry and not soft at all. The smell/fragrance was so overpowering, it made my head hurt, it is just too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two uses, my hair still doesn&#x27;t feel good after washing it out but there has been a decrease in breakage/shedding. To help soften my hair and make detangling easier (this does not have very good slip) I add a cheapie conditioner to my hair for about 3 minutes after I wash this out. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll repurchase this again, while I love the Shea Moisture line, I have terrible luck with their conditioners and masques.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once, and it left my hair really soft, but I will only know a true verdict once I continue to use it. My biggest turn off is the smell. It has a really strong floral-perfume scent that lingers even after you wash it out. That&#x27;s my biggest turn off.</li>
    <li> I bought this at ulta today, I have fine, slightly frizzy, dry ends. I used it for 15 minutes with a heat cap, and rinsed it out, then I used a moisterizing conditioner left it in while I showered... my hair came out great ! Soft, shiny, dry ends are gone. The trick is to moisterize after the treatment  - not sure why, but I did read it from another review, maybe because of all the protein in it ? Great job, I will use this mask once a week, and maybe try more in this product line.</li>
    <li> This product is a must for Naturally curly and kinky hair, keeps hair moisturized and soft. The reason i say not to buy it is because in Target and Walgreens this and all the other shea moisture products cost on average $9-$11... Buyer beware this is a true rip off.</li>
    <li> I found out about this on youtube natural hair community, and purchased it I like this product and it smells good!</li>
    <li> My hair is FINE, and this did not weigh it down.  Applied first thing in shower, combed thru, did my business and shampooed it out.  Used more than once a week- still no probs!  Luv!</li>
    <li> I have 4a/4b type hair that has been shedding more than usual.  Since I like every other Shea Moisture product I&#x27;ve tried so far, I decided this would be good for my hair also.  I first used it in conjunction with the SM Deep Treatment Masque and that seemed like overload, though my hair needs plenty of moisture.  I tried to do a twist out like I normally do, but it turned out frizzy and not at all like it usually does. It&#x27;s humid now, so I think that was the reason--I used it again this time with a little olive oil and styled it with Eco Styler gel and the results were much better.  As for the shedding, it was reduced, but only if I use it as a leave-in, not as a rinse out.  I gave it 4 stars because it does what it says it will do, but I&#x27;m not sure if it will give me the end results any better than a good old spray of acv or black tea rinse--both which reduce shedding.  I also love the smell, but all in all, it is definitely not worth buying from this seller as opposed to buying it at Target or Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This product works well but i don&#x27;t like the way it feels on my ends. When I run out I do not intend to repurchase this product but it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
    <li> I read that indian women use yucca on there hair to keep it shiny and strong.....and yucca is a cactus. I&#x27;m blonde and have dry hair and this mask transformed my hair greatly. My tip is the longer u leave it on the softer your hair will be. Actually..I wouldn&#x27;t apply it inless u have an hour or more to leave it on or else your just wasting your money. Over night is good to.</li>
    <li> I use this masque every time I shampoo because my hair is very long and breakage is always an issue.  I need a bit more &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; than regular conditioner provides and after using this masque my hair is definitely easier to detangle.  I have used it for 5 minutes and also with heat for an hour.  In both cases, it worked beautifully.  It also smells amazing.  It contains raw shea butter which is very moisturizing.  After using this, I really do see less breakage when combing through my wet hair.  It definitely isn&#x27;t just for African American hair.  It&#x27;s super thick and rich and small amount does the job.  Although it likely contains silicone, it also has ingredients that impart strength and shine.  All I know is that my hair behaves very well after using this.  I also use the Jamaican Black Castor Oil shampoo, which I love and which is my new all time favorite shampoo.  The two together do a fantastic job of cleansing my hair and leaving it soft and shiny.  I also really like the fact that these products aren&#x27;t expensive.  Ten or eleven dollars for a bottle of conditioner and a generous jar of deep conditioner is a fair price.  I definitely recommend both products highly.</li>
    <li> So I have naturally curly-type 3b/3c-hair but I&#x27;ve been experiencing a lot of shedding (hair coming directly from follicle with hair bulb attached)lately. I purchased this product 2 weeks ago from Walmart at $11.98 and I totally love it! Not only does it smell great but it made my hair softer, and it feels stronger. My hair shedding has definitely reduced. My method: I wash my hair, apply this deep conditioner with a plastic cap and my towel twist-tie leaving for about 3 hours (I know it&#x27;s overkill). When I wash this deep conditioner out of my hair it feels amazing. I plan to do the Black Tea rinse (for shedding) first then apply this deep conditioning masque this coming Sunday. I hope this combination works out well for me. Regardless of, this product is highly recommended by me (I&#x27;ve tried so many products over the years). I will be purchasing the Shampoo, Growth Milk, and Leave-In conditioner next :-)</li>
    <li> I have tried this product twice. Both times it has led to my ultimate frustration. I tried it once as a protein treatment before perming my hair, which resulted in ironically more breakage than prior to applying the treatment, drier, duller looking hair. But one thing I will say is that I think since this is a mild protein treatment I should have followed it up with a moisturizing deep conditioner, which I didn&#x27;t. For that reason I decided to go again and use it as a protein treatment at 3 weeks post. The same thing happened, my hair felt stripped as I rinsed it and while I was styling I noticed breakage(which I wasn&#x27;t getting before). I feel as though my hair would have broke more if my regular moisturizing deep conditioner didn&#x27;t come to the rescue. It was because of that that I was able to get my hair to feel soft again. Even though followed up with a moisturizing deep conditioner, it doesn&#x27;t feel the same. It&#x27;ll take another week or two for my hair to rejuvinate with religious moisturizing deep conditionings. Also I almost never complain about smell, but this product wreaks of mens colonge, which isn&#x27;t very pleasant when I have to sit with this on top of my head for 15-30 minutes under a hooded dryer. I don&#x27;t care how much I paid for this, I&#x27;m going to toss it because it only seems to be doing my hair injustice.</li>
    <li> I started off with the shea moisture line for curls (the pink one) My hair is between 3a-3b It&#x27;s a bit expensive but I liked how natural it was and it didn&#x27;t weigh down my hair. Then I took the plunge and colored my naturally dark locks to blonde. I love the color, but after all the hair stylist did to my hair, my curls were dead. I found out that frizz looks worse on light hair than dark, suprise!&lt;br /&gt;I knew so recover my curl &#x27; s former glory I needed to start a deep condition regament asap. So I went to my local beauty supply with the intent of buying the moisture line, but found this line instead. I have to say after three uses, my hair looks so much better. I pretty much use it ever time I shower (a little goes a long way) and it feels soft and strong again. I definately have to do more to it now in terms of leave in conditioners and serums, but this stuff definitely is the new backbone to my hair routine.</li>
    <li> I tried Shea Moisture Anti-Breakage Masque as a pre-shampoo detangler/deep conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not have good slip and does okay in the moisturizing department. It smells strongly of flowers. It may work as a protein conditioner but A) I&#x27;m not experienced with protein conditioners and B) I do not feel the need to use protein conditioners for my kinky coily hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer Shea Moisture Purification Masque in regard to texture, smell, slip and moisture. I will not repurchase the Shea Moisture Anti-Braekage Masque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Water, Shea Butter,  Coconut Oil, Mango Butter, Avocado Oil, Olive Oil, Aloe Vera Leaf Extract , Ammonium Salt (Conditioner) , Yucca Filamentosa Extract , Vegetable Protein, Baobab Extract, Biotin, Panthenol (Vitamin B-5) , Rosemary Extract, Bamboo Extract, Sorbitol Esters, Caprylyl Glycol, Essential Oil Blend, Tocopherol (Vitamin E)</li>
    <li> So, I hate that people are giving this bad reviews because of the price. That&#x27;s not fair to the product. But they are true, this masque is now carried at Target and Walmart for only $9.99 so you probably want to buy from there if you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the product, it is great! I am a natural with thin fine hair that breaks at a whim. I use this masque as a deep conditioner and what I notice is less breakage when I detangle and my hair is more moisturized. I was using Aubrey Organics before this and it didn&#x27;t even come close to SM. Also, I have noticed that before when I would wash my hair, when I came up from the sink and do a quick towel dry, water would just drip, drip, drip from my hair for minutes later like my hair wasn&#x27;t retaining any of it. I don&#x27;t have that problem any more since I started using this product. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> I have type 4a natural hair that I kind of neglected and then got frustrated at the amount of hair that came out in the shower, in my comb, in my hand... I bought this, and the first day I used it I went through the deep conditioning process twice with it since my hair was so badly damaged and now I see about 75% less hair fall out. I love it, it&#x27;s worth it. I have shoulder length hair, I scoop a little with my fingers and spread it through my hair and leave it on for about 30 minutes under a plastic bag or shower cap. I don&#x27;t lay it on too thick but I still see amazing results. This will probably last me about 15 deep conditioning treatments. My hair is stronger. The smell is fine, it&#x27;s a flowery scent, and it does go away as soon as you wash it out, especially if you&#x27;re following up with a leave in conditioner of some sort which I recommend doing. Great product, will buy again when I run out, or try another masque from this brand. Yes it is expensive on amazon, BUT this product is only sold in select Walgreens and Targets across the nation, and not everyone can go get it locally. Honestly, it&#x27;s still worth it at this price, it&#x27;s a great product and I was impressed. Hope this was helpful!</li>
    <li> Avoid this product at all costs, for it nearly destroyed my hair and accelerated hair breakage. I can bearly use words to describe the level of horror I experienced after using this so-called anti-breakage masque. My hair became unmanageable fragile, frizzy and hard! It has been two weeks and I am still trying to reserve the damage this product has inflicted on my hair! And this company will never get another dim from me ever again.</li>
