<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These clips perfectly fit the Andis T-Outliner Trimmer with T-Blade (04710), which I know was a concern in the reviews.</li>
    <li> I use these on my Andis trimmer. The work like they are supposed to. If you do get a trimmer I would recommend these guards for a nnininiform trim.</li>
    <li> On time.  As expected.  Would recommend.  Would order again.</li>
    <li> I was so glad that I found these attachments. If you own a pair of andis clippers you know you have a good set. I had misplace my original attachments but was so happy I could buy them this way. Just as perfect as the original. Now I can enjoy living life on the \\&quot;edge\\&quot; once again.</li>
    <li> Break easily... This is was my second purchase before I switched to an all metal buzzer.</li>
    <li> The blades are not the same as the original ones that came with trimmer. They are of poor quality and don&#x27;t fit the trimmer well</li>
    <li> I love these clip on attachments now I can better groom my beard using my powerful and is instead of my battery operated groomer.</li>
    <li> found what i needed. thank you.</li>
    <li> perfect fit and does what it says it does</li>
    <li> Perfect for timing and grooming my beard. Regular beard trimmers are too weak to deal with the large amount of pure godlike manliness emanating from my face. Andis clippers with these guards do the trick!.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. I am very satisfied with my purchase</li>
    <li> yep, great replacement for old one&#x27;s that I have</li>
    <li> very good... only place to get trimmer attachments for Andis.  not much else to say... I don&#x27;t like writing reviews...</li>
    <li> Combs fit my t-blade trimmer without problem.  Trims my beard fine, and saves me the trouble of packing my large clippers when I travel.</li>
    <li> Great quality product!</li>
    <li> Fits on the Andis 4770 T-Blade clippers perfectly! Great to addition if you want to cut hair with them as well.</li>
    <li> They fit and work but they slide back and fourth and little and if you have a longer beard or hair it will tend to pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that they do what they are supposed to</li>
    <li> been wanting these for a long time....</li>
    <li> Breaks easily just like the original</li>
    <li> Works perfectly!  My goatee looks perfect every time!</li>
    <li> It was the wrong kit. I&#x27;ve got the andis-x and these are too wide. It doesn&#x27;t specify which trimmers work with this set!</li>
    <li> They fit in perfectly, I broke one of them already from not being careful.</li>
    <li> Great for keeping your beard trimmed all the same length.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for my clippers</li>
    <li> Great Attachment Combs Set, fit great on my Andis T Edgers (04710) which was purchased from amazon also and does a great job on my beard and sideburns I love the snap on comb set and T Edgers. I have purchased several grooming and shaving products from amazon do y&#x27;all have attache bag our a shaving bag to store are carry the products in, this would be great Thank You .</li>
    <li> These didn&#x27;t come as described, completely wrong attachments that didn&#x27;t fit my t trimmer at all. You may have better luck than I did.</li>
    <li> Cracked with in 2 weeks. Plus shows dirt and provides no protection. Need to say it sure is slim. So please don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> The attachments stay on and seem they will last for days to come.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly on my andis. Love the Price too.</li>
    <li> works perfect for curly beards</li>
    <li> Works for the T-Outliner, they help to be sure tour hair is the perfect length every time. Good product to buy</li>
    <li> These plastic guides are well made and sturdy. They fit the Andis Styliner II perfectly! They will probably last for the life of the trimmer. I have used these guides for trimming my beard for over 10 years. I have changed my blades twice in the last 10 years, but I&#x27;ve never had to replace these guides. I purchased this particular set for my son. They deserve 5 stars without a doubt.</li>
    <li> Excellent, fit perfectly.  This was a replacement set for the original and this set was identical.  These fit Andis Outliner II trimmer.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly ordered for the 2nd time because I lost my favorite guard on the 1st order while traveling.  I use for my goatee</li>
    <li> Clips hold on very well and do a great job!</li>
    <li> These are right on point for my t-blades. It locks in the blades and never shakes while in use</li>
    <li> I have used a guard twice for my beard and so far so good.  Easy on and off the clippers.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift. My brother in law works as a barber and he loves this together with the Andis professional 4710&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped and delivery was quick. Excellent product and vendor. Recommended 100%</li>
    <li> I said it&#x27;s Andis. What can go wrong. Well, the comb would break piece by piece. I purchased to get as close as possible but that failed.</li>
    <li> works fine with andis t-outliner trimmer. bought these for the trimmer i bought and they fit well and work great.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly and now I know where to get them.</li>
    <li> Great produce. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Great combs for a great product. Gets m uh beard to desired length each and every time. Again, great product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this snap on. They arrived right away, even though I had the slowest shipping request, and they fix like a glove. I&#x27;m so happy about that. I was a little worried, but yes yes yes. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more. So I have a professional trimmer with professional attachments and I&#x27;m in heaven. Get these for sure, if you&#x27;re already buying the Andis trimmers.</li>
    <li> These things help me keep my goatee in shape between visits to my barber. They&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> These attachments were included with my Andis superliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanna help Andis Superliner owners since there is little info about the compatibility.</li>
    <li> was too wide for my andis.  needs better description.  Product is good just doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
    <li> Painful experience when trying to trim my beard. With the guards on, it pulls my hair. For me these attachments are useless.</li>
    <li> great addition to the andis clipper</li>
    <li> Works good. Use it to trim my beard. No complaints</li>
    <li> All good, they fit perfectly. As if Andis&#x27; made it for their clippers :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only gripe I have is the underside of the comb is not designed to be comfortable sliding backwards on someone&#x27;s chin or neck or wherever else it gets used. Each one of the comb&#x27;s teeth ends in a pointy, rather dangerously so, odd tip on the underside of the comb. So if you ever want to backtrack to go over an area again, you have to be VERY careful of the angle. I ended up filing down mine.</li>
    <li> Cause it was exactly what i had before when i got my trimmer the clips fit prefect. Great deal for the clippers</li>
    <li> I read on a couple of reviews that these guards fit too tightly. Maybe they change them because mine fit PERFECTLY. Like they seem made for this thing and work GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cut I get using these is even better than my mustache trimmer (that is the #1 best seller for mustache trimmers here on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased! They look nicer than the picture shown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only con would be that the size of them is hard to read on the back (though it&#x27;s pretty easy to figure out which is which). I just took a silver permanent marker and wrote 1, 2, 3, and 4 on the underside of the guards.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fits the clipper well, and does it&#x27;s job. Only downside is that there is no 1/16th comb! Too long for the stubble look!</li>
    <li> It is a Perfect match to my machine and they work really well. I recommend them if you lost your original ones</li>
    <li> I bought these for my Andis T Outliner. They snap on easily and they are pretty sturdy. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> Shipment was fast. Fit my trimmer</li>
    <li> This fits the Andis T-Outliner Trimmer perfectly.It works well to trim mustache. It snaps on and off easily. That&#x27;s all</li>
    <li> Easily snaps on. Very useful.</li>
    <li> They fit my t-outliners perfectly, but I worry about their durability.</li>
    <li> I have the Andis T Outliner trimmer and wanted some guides for trimming the occasional beard. Really like the trimmer itself, but these guides are tricky. They fit. But too tightly---so much so that the blade isn&#x27;t able to move after locking it into place. Perhaps with normal &#x27;wear&#x27;, they will loosen a bit, but so far I&#x27;ve been resorting to pressing the guide upward after it&#x27;s attached so it doesn&#x27;t catch the blade. My thumb hurts. But in a manly, beard-faced way.</li>
    <li> My girl broke my favorite one so I ordered another set. They work for me when I trim my facial hair. I received them quickly in the mail.</li>
    <li> no issues and snaps right onto my shaver.</li>
    <li> ​►Keep losing these damn things. EVERY time I fly,... TSA has some &#x27;fetish with confiscating these attachments. :-(</li>
    <li> stainless steel works better than the plastic.  I could not get the plastic attached so probably ordered the worng size.  I am not a hair dresser and a professional would have known what to order.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, I like it</li>
    <li> I REPORTED PROSDUCT NOT FIYTTING EXSITING TRIMMER AS SHOWN IN ORDER........NOTHING TO EXPLAIN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!MAYBE SOME ELASPES TIMR AND NOTHING AS IN REPSLCEMENT OR SHIP BACK INSRTURIONS .I THREW AWAY .NO MORE FROM ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WOULD NOT FIT MODEL AS I HAD ORDERED !!!!</li>
    <li> either too short or too long....doesn&#x27;t correspond to standard clipper sizes. Angle of cutting blade make for blotchy trimming when used at the jawline. used them once.very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am completely disappointed. The clips are so tight to mouth of blades that it actually restricts movement. I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> These work and do the job, but are very flimsy and break very easily.  If you&#x27;re carful with them, they should last for you, but unfortunately I&#x27;m not the most careful person in the world :P</li>
    <li> Did not find the Andis, Attached ti my Andis T-edger clipper and clippers did not run, returned item. Dissapointed</li>
    <li> work very good&lt;br /&gt;on my old Andis Attachment Set 4 Snap easy&lt;br /&gt;buy it is a good Andis Attachment Set 4 Snap On Combs</li>
    <li> This was what I was looking for, a great product. Really all andis products are great. I already had the t-outliner by Andis.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, They were exactly as described and what I needed</li>
    <li> these combs are perfect for using when you want to use the same trimmer machine. combs fit perfectly on trimmer!</li>
    <li> The clipper guides are the same that came with the clipper when it was purchased originally and they fit the clipper well.</li>
    <li> great great great great deal. Nice clipper guards,pretty cheap and fit Andis t outliner like a glove,Only ones I&#x27;ve found that do</li>
    <li> GAVE TO MY SON FOR HIS BEARD, CAN&#x27;T BEAT IT</li>
    <li> I got exactly what I expected and they fit my trimmer the way they should. These appear to be the same combs the came with my trimmer originally.</li>
    <li> Great! Sturdy and long lasting (bought it 6 months ago)</li>
    <li> Quite pleased with various sizes offered. The specific attachment I wanted works wonderfully,easy installation and excellent results. Yes, I&#x27;d recommend these attachments for the challenging ones.</li>
    <li> I already had a nice Andis trimmer but I recently grew a full beard and needed a way to keep it neatly trimmed.  Andis was out of stock so I found them on Amazon.  These items arrived quickly and were nicely packaged in a bubble wrap envelope.  They are just what the doctor ordered!  I highly recommend Amazon and these combs.</li>
    <li> Fits my Andis perfectly. Looks and works like the original.</li>
    <li> For T-Trimmer.  Inexpensive way to make your trimmer more versatile.  Clips on to razor head and allows one to select height for trimming beard to uniform height.&lt;br /&gt;Take combs off to outline/shape goatee or beard.  Works well since Andis trimmers are not like an animal clipper in allowing for a blade change to increase height.</li>
    <li> I was looking for attachments for my Andis T Outliner and these work excellent the use of my T Outliner has now been extended.</li>
    <li> Can beat it great deal!</li>
    <li> As expected, fits razor ad advertised.</li>
    <li> These are simple but fit the Andis T-Outliner Trimmer perfectly and work great.  Highly recommended.  They allow you to automatically cut hair the length you want.</li>
    <li> Fit perfect !! Saved a few bucks cant complain!</li>
    <li> fits the Andis T trimmer I purchased.</li>
    <li> These combs fit the trimmer blade perfectly, but the corners and teeth are unnecessarily sharp.  I would like to see a new approach to the design with rounded edges where they contact skin.  Also, the plastic is a bit brittle and can break under pressure in a travel bag, resulting in very sharp edges.  If you break a corner of one of these combs, I recommend throwing it away immediately and ordering a replacement.</li>
    <li> Shipping took forever. Also product was received with one of the clips broken!</li>
    <li> These look like the combs that came with clipper. Works great.</li>
    <li> If you own an Andis trimmer, then you need this set.  Cheap and sturdy.  Cannot ask for a better deal.</li>
    <li> So far so good  for my t outliner</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly and stay on. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> Worked as described perfectly for my andis t edger</li>
    <li> A little flimsy and sometimes comes off while clipped in. But it gets the job done for the price.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. The quality of these combs isn&#x27;t great but they work great for what they are and how much they cost.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed to get the job done.  Came packaged well and was exactly as advertised.  An excellent product.</li>
    <li> My son loved them and they do the job that is required of them.  I enjoy cutting, these make it more precise. Thank You!  from Jan the Man</li>
    <li> Heads fit the shaver well and work fine, I&#x27;m not sure on durability since I&#x27;ve only used them once, but works fine otherwise and are good for the money.</li>
