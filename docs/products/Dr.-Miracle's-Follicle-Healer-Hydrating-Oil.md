      <li>I have very fine hair, but a lot of it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve received so many compliments about my hair from people of all races.  </li>
      <li>i tried it a couple of times just to makes sure.</li>
      <li>Try it, I believe that you will be satisfied.</li>
      <li>NOTHING MORE TO SAY...</li>
      <li>I would give it more than 5 stars.  </li>
      <li>This line is fantastic!</li>
      <li>I started noticing more hair in my comb and brush and just running my fingers through my hair resulted in more strands falling out.  </li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be using this product any more.</li>
      <li>Nice light  cream, not greasy</li>
      <li>I love the tingly feeling.  </li>
      <li>and it seems   to  be more  vigorous.</li>

      <li>So  first of all ,I&#x27;m  Caucasian with  very fine  </li>
      <li>It tingles for a long time and it&#x27;s smells great.  </li>
      <li>This has a nice light fragrance and feels nice on wet hair.  </li>
      <li>END OF SUBJECT, GOOD DAY.</li>
      <li>normal cheap tresemme conditioner actually softens my hair much more than this product.</li>
      <li>These are great products and now, after 2 months, I hardly see any hair in my comb and brush.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Dr. Miracle!</li>
      <li>will buy more later</li>
      <li>Again, I love it, totally works for me!</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I had been experiencing a lot of breakage since trying to grow my hair long and had used many conditioners and treatments attempting to stop the wad of hair I would pull out of the drain every time I showered.  </li>
      <li>Very tinglely to scalp.</li>
      <li>The cream is very refreshing!&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;So fast forward to about one month ago</li>
      <li>This product stopped the breakage in my hair and don&#x27;t notice a whole bunch of hair in my brush.</li>
      <li>Which means your pore  &amp; scalp get some much needed air &amp; blood flow.</li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing, but my hair needs that.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t really stick to it.</li>
      <li>my hair is 4a, i shampoo then put this product in my hair as a leave in treatment, it really made my eyes water a lot, and the menthol burns a bit.</li>
      <li>I only use the product on my hairline to smooth out the fuzzies in the morning.</li>
      <li>I use a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner then towel dry my hair and spread 2 quarter size amounts of this through my hair, first on the ends then all the way through.</li>
      <li>right in (even though I gave up on being natural about 6 months ago).  </li>
      <li>This product is actually changing the texture of my hair making it significantly softer and smoother.</li>
      <li>my hair is falling  less  now,than it  did when it was healthy and not  treated</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
      <li>I used the Hot Gro cream from this line for a while last year</li>
      <li>I tried the Anti-Breakage Strengthening Creme and after about 3 weeks I noticed a considerable difference.  </li>
      <li>My hair is natural.  </li>
      <li>I have natural hair, I do think this product helps with strengthening the hair shaft, but it do not have the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Even so, months later, my hair has grown SO much.</li>
      <li>It works really well and minimizes potential breakage.</li>
      <li>I really wanted my hair to grow, though, so sometime last year (maybe about November or December), I started to use this one and the Oil Sheen Spray from this line.</li>
      <li>You know, natural hair is in so looking thick and healthy fits</li>
      <li>It is wavy  and breaks easily when it grows past my shoulders.  </li>
      <li>Then gently comb through and let dry naturally.  </li>
      <li>I use thus daily it has really started my edges growing back.</li>
      <li>I actually use the cream to roll my hair once a week and it looks so thick and healthy.  </li>
      <li>Strength, not too sure, because my hair line wasn&#x27;t weak to begin with.</li>
      <li>I was heartbroken because while I was pregnant and for at least 5 years prior to getting pregnant my hair was always well past my shoulders (despite the frequent issues I had while in high school of my hair</li>
      <li>Willing to give it a little more time, but so far I am not impressed.</li>
      <li>Okay, so I&#x27;m a Black woman in my thirties who has had problems in the past with my hair breaking off.  </li>
      <li>It gives my hair more umph which I have not seen any other hair care product do (at least on my hair).  </li>

<li> I brush it into while still wet.</li>
<li> It dried my hair out immediately, to the point where I had to get back in the shower, rinse it out, and put in another conditioner.  </li>
<li> Not really for use on every hair type.</li>
<li> This new smell is NOT a good one.</li>
<li> So I&#x27;ve read that other reviewers indicated that it made their hair kink up.  </li>
<li> I had some areas of breakage/balding due to bonded hair extensions, tight sewins, etc.  </li>
<li> Since using this I have had much less breakage and clogged drains.  </li>
<li> Works ok but not well enough to compensate for how bad it stinks.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m beginning to think it was a waste of money.</li>
<li> i wasted my money, this product should not be on the market.</li>
<li> I will say that you should be mindful that your hair may feel a bit drier than usual</li>
<li> I do get lazy from time to time</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
<li> I was still skeptical and not totally sold on Dr. Miracle until I tried the cream.  </li>
<li> It is a hair treatment that has the consistency of a medium thick conditioner that you scoop out of a small tub.  </li>
<li> my hair began shedding and breaking like crazy especially around the edges of my hair</li>
<li> This product is helping to fill in the weak spots.  </li>
<li> This product was the absolute worst!</li>
<li> or I got a bad one?  </li>
<li> This stuff STINKS!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get results as claimed to work on hair breakage</li>
    <li> good product, works well to strengthen the hair</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I used the Hot Gro cream from this line for a while last year but I didn&#x27;t really stick to it. I really wanted my hair to grow, though, so sometime last year (maybe about November or December), I started to use this one and the Oil Sheen Spray from this line. I do get lazy from time to time so sometimes I only used it once a day or maybe none at all. Even so, months later, my hair has grown SO much. This line is fantastic!</li>
    <li> So  first of all ,I&#x27;m  Caucasian with  very fine  treated  damaged hair,and I thought of  giving this one a  try- my hair is falling  less  now,than it  did when it was healthy and not  treated and it seems   to  be more  vigorous.</li>
    <li> my hair is 4a, i shampoo then put this product in my hair as a leave in treatment, it really made my eyes water a lot, and the menthol burns a bit. it doesnt even make my hair any softer at all, i pasted my entire hair with the product an all. i tried it a couple of times just to makes sure. it left my hair harddd!!  normal cheap tresemme conditioner actually softens my hair much more than this product. i wasted my money, this product should not be on the market.</li>
    <li> I would give it more than 5 stars.  It is a hair treatment that has the consistency of a medium thick conditioner that you scoop out of a small tub.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor or any that I notice.  I have very fine hair, but a lot of it. It is wavy  and breaks easily when it grows past my shoulders.  I had been experiencing a lot of breakage since trying to grow my hair long and had used many conditioners and treatments attempting to stop the wad of hair I would pull out of the drain every time I showered.  Since using this I have had much less breakage and clogged drains.  I use a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner then towel dry my hair and spread 2 quarter size amounts of this through my hair, first on the ends then all the way through. Then gently comb through and let dry naturally.  It adds shine and strength and gets rid of frizz. I have also noticed that it keeps the shape of any style I brush it into while still wet.</li>
    <li> I only use the product on my hairline to smooth out the fuzzies in the morning. This product is actually changing the texture of my hair making it significantly softer and smoother. Strength, not too sure, because my hair line wasn&#x27;t weak to begin with. But I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> This stuff STINKS!! This new smell is NOT a good one. Works ok but not well enough to compensate for how bad it stinks.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair, I do think this product helps with strengthening the hair shaft, but it do not have the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; as the shampoo does, therefore I don&#x27;t know why the named it \\&quot;Feel It\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> Not really for use on every hair type. Has a lot of water and not as creamer as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> I use thus daily it has really started my edges growing back. And is strengthening my hair I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feel soft and smooth.  I love the tingly feeling.  It also controls dryness.  It is a geat leave-in conditioner.  Try it, I believe that you will be satisfied.</li>
    <li> This has a nice light fragrance and feels nice on wet hair.  It helps give a gentle hold to a sculpted look but feels a little tacky when hair is dry.</li>
    <li> I use several Dr. Miracle&#x27;s products but this one doesn&#x27;t work for me. It leaves my hair dry un unmanageable. I tried using the hair oil to soften it, but that method didn&#x27;t work. I won&#x27;t be using this product any more.</li>
    <li> Once again Dr. Miracle pulled a miracle. This product stopped the breakage in my hair and don&#x27;t notice a whole bunch of hair in my brush.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair and use this daily for moisture and control.  It works really well and minimizes potential breakage.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time.Am still trying it to see how it works</li>
    <li> I started noticing more hair in my comb and brush and just running my fingers through my hair resulted in more strands falling out.  I went to a beauty supply store and asked which products helped with hair falling out.  Dr. Miracle was recommended.  I heard of these products before but never used them.  I tried the Anti-Breakage Strengthening Creme and after about 3 weeks I noticed a considerable difference.  So I started using all of Dr. Miracle&#x27;s products, the shampoo, the follicle healer, the intensive spot serum, etc.  These are great products and now, after 2 months, I hardly see any hair in my comb and brush.  Thanks Dr. Miracle!</li>
    <li> Always buy...really works</li>
    <li> use these only when my scalp need moistriizing.  It tingles for a long time and it&#x27;s smells great.  will buy more later</li>
    <li> My hair is natural.  I had some areas of breakage/balding due to bonded hair extensions, tight sewins, etc.  This product is helping to fill in the weak spots.  My hair feels great. It is very moisturizing, but my hair needs that.</li>
    <li> I put on every time I&#x27;m about to style my hair and before I go to bed and makes my hair smell nice, look shiny and helps it straighten  out, will buy again</li>
    <li> The cream is very refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;But I don&#x27;t like the results at the ends of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I have only applied this twice. Nice light  cream, not greasy but My hair is drier than before and I am not feeling any tingling at all.  Maybe they changed the formula or I got a bad one?  i wanted to try it because of the reviews here and on sally beauty but I&#x27;m beginning to think it was a waste of money. Willing to give it a little more time, but so far I am not impressed. If I see any more results I will edit this review.</li>
    <li> IT WAS (I-COOL) I DID NOT LIKE!!!!!!  WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY?  NOTHING MORE TO SAY...END OF SUBJECT, GOOD DAY.</li>
    <li> This product was the absolute worst! It dried my hair out immediately, to the point where I had to get back in the shower, rinse it out, and put in another conditioner.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Great product! It wakes up your hair roots. Light weight. Very tinglely to scalp. Which means your pore  &amp; scalp get some much needed air &amp; blood flow. Course hair girls this is a must.</li>
    <li> This product has made my hair strong and my edges happy with the results. I would definately purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m a Black woman in my thirties who has had problems in the past with my hair breaking off.  After I had my son (I had an epidural and breastfed for a year) my hair began shedding and breaking like crazy especially around the edges of my hair (it&#x27;s been about a year since it stopped shedding/breaking), it was like a halo of breakage.  I was heartbroken because while I was pregnant and for at least 5 years prior to getting pregnant my hair was always well past my shoulders (despite the frequent issues I had while in high school of my hair breaking).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So fast forward to about one month ago when I decided to try Dr. Miracle&#x27;s cream.  I had already tried the gro oil which seemed to be working (I&#x27;ve been using that off and on for about three months).  I was still skeptical and not totally sold on Dr. Miracle until I tried the cream.  So I&#x27;ve read that other reviewers indicated that it made their hair kink up.  Let me just say that it definitely adds a ton of BODY to your hair.  I am totally loving the body.  I actually use the cream to roll my hair once a week and it looks so thick and healthy.  You know, natural hair is in so looking thick and healthy fits right in (even though I gave up on being natural about 6 months ago).  My hair has been growing back and is currently shoulder length.  It gives my hair more umph which I have not seen any other hair care product do (at least on my hair).  This cream will be a part of my hair care regimen for a long time regardless of if I&#x27;m having hair issues or not.  I&#x27;ve received so many compliments about my hair from people of all races.  It&#x27;s fly and I&#x27;m not even in the salon every week or even every two weeks.  I will say that you should be mindful that your hair may feel a bit drier than usual but I&#x27;ve been balancing that with argan oil that I mix in with the cream whenever I apply it.  Again, I love it, totally works for me!</li>
