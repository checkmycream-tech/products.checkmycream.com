      <li>Love the product</li>
      <li>Since receiving the product I have used it three times and love the way my skin and face feel afterwards.</li>

      <li>It was easy to use, I will keep using it.</li>
      <li>I purchased this kit because of the strong reviews.  </li>
      <li>I saw a huge difference and decided that 30 minutes was nothing for what this kit does for your face.  </li>
      <li>Would be great if one could order individually.  </li>
      <li>but I did not know a refill kit was available.  </li>
      <li>This really works!!!</li>
      <li>Was excited to start it and had to go buy a brush to apply.</li>
      <li>I have enjoyed it for a few years and it has been great.  </li>
      <li>After reading many positive reviews I decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>I love the mask because it really pulls out the debris and the serum tightens the skin.</li>
      <li>I trust Swisa Beauty completely, and also love their body lotion.</li>
      <li>Its worth the shipping wait, which is super fast.</li>
      <li>I sat back and watched a movie while the product worked its magic.</li>
      <li>skin was so soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I love the way you can actually feel it tightening your face, and yes it is true, you actually do notice the difference after the first treatment.</li>
      <li>The directions are simple and easy to follow.</li>
      <li>After 30 minutes the mask rinsed off easily with water and left no residue.</li>
      <li>but I think that can be avoided as long as you really do relax while it is working and do not move around :)</li>
      <li>It really did soften it up and gave my skin and very light lines a little plump, plus it looked rather fresh.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t buy this stuff in the Mall, they charge too much, and I don&#x27;t trust some of them.</li>
      <li>I really dislike the way it works.</li>
      <li>When I received it, I saw that the primary ingredient in the mask in ALBUMIN (egg white).  </li>
      <li>The mask tightens and once removed really smooths the skin.  </li>
      <li>I followed the instructions precisely, even adding a second layer as directed.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>This stuff is all natural, and pure.</li>
      <li>this stuff is amazing, believe me, I am the hardest person in the entire world to please and have fallen victim to commercials, ads, magazines and spent so much money on products that I am embarrassed to say the amount.</li>
      <li>All I can say is Wow!  </li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>I chose this rating because on the 1st use my face felt alive and on the 2nd use I really saw a difference.</li>
      <li>I am 52 years old and look much younger than my age, but was starting to see sagging jowls and deepening smile lines.</li>
      <li>It is non-greasy and leaves the skin feeling soft.</li>
      <li>Wow, five stars do not do this product justice.</li>
      <li>Some people are sensitive to albumin, although not allergic.    </li>
      <li>So far it is working.  </li>
      <li>One always has too much of the activator left when the powder is gone.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised at how I looked after a treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Looked</li>
      <li>It makes your face and skin really soft and supple.</li>
      <li>If someone has complained about it they are either lying or have had too many skin problems during their life.</li>
      <li>Just called Amazon customer service, and a new package was at my door next day!</li>
      <li>I was anxious to try it right away!</li>
      <li>Too bad because it was a great product.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this product I thought \\&quot;I don&#x27;t have time to sit or lie down for 30 minutes for this to dry.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>This masque pulls your skin up and back so much when drying, you could only get the same visual effect by sticking your head out the car window with your doggie going 70mph.</li>

<li> This masque pulls your skin up and back so much when drying, you could only get the same visual effect by sticking your head out the car window with your doggie going 70mph.</li>
<li> I can see a very subtle softening of the scars and the age lines aren&#x27;t as prominent as they used to be since using the Dead Sea Face Lift Kit.</li>
<li> If there is any change at all, it is only for a few minutes immediately after the concoction is removed, and does not last.</li>
<li> As it dries, it pulls your facial skin so tight that the surface of the product cracks, you can&#x27;t move any part of your face at all, even your mouth, and by the time it is to be removed you look like a hideous zombie.</li>
<li> My skin is not very saggy, baggy or wrinkly.</li>
<li> Furthermore, I have seen absolutely no difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
<li> Worked as well as i expected.  </li>
<li> The mask pulled DOWN on the outer corners of my eyes and eyebrows.    </li>
<li> You feel a slight pulse as the mask dries and tightens.</li>
<li> A friend thought it was too harsh on her face</li>
<li> The ones which \\&quot;work\\&quot; always have some sort of drawback (leave a white film behind; crack or distort it you touch your face after it dries).</li>
<li> The kit should have involved dead sea powder, and an activator, so that you can make a mask.</li>
<li> This product seems to me is a bad imitation of  the real thing: &amp;#34;Distinction&amp;#34; by Leigh Valentine.  </li>
<li> You could seriously scare people looking like that.</li>
<li> It has realy a dramatic effect on the face itraied it on my mother</li>
<li> Although I am unable to buy it again.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m skeptical of these types of products.</li>
<li> wonderfull ,don&#x27;t like the price jumping around, getting crazy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The mask tightens and once removed really smooths the skin.  In addition the moisturizer is a wonderful finishing touch to keep your face even softer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this kit because of the strong reviews.  When I received it, I saw that the primary ingredient in the mask in ALBUMIN (egg white).  Some people are sensitive to albumin, although not allergic.    I followed the instructions precisely, even adding a second layer as directed.  I did not feel any pulsing or throbbing of my face or neck.  The mask pulled DOWN on the outer corners of my eyes and eyebrows.    When I removed the mask I was red and blotchy.  I could not have gone to work or gone out in that condition.  But more to the point, there was no difference in the smoothness or tightness of my skin.  I&#x27;ll be returning the kit.    I AM POSTING A PHOTO ABOVE, SHOWING WHAT I LOOKED LIKE AFTER THE TREATMENT.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing, believe me, I am the hardest person in the entire world to please and have fallen victim to commercials, ads, magazines and spent so much money on products that I am embarrassed to say the amount. this is the only thing I have used that actually made a difference. I am 51, been using it for a month now. People say I look ten years younger. I love the way you can actually feel it tightening your face, and yes it is true, you actually do notice the difference after the first treatment. NO LIE. I trust Swisa Beauty completely, and also love their body lotion. Just wish they would get the fragrance \\&quot;Joop\\&quot; back. It was my favorite. Don&#x27;t buy this stuff in the Mall, they charge too much, and I don&#x27;t trust some of them. Get it here on Amazon for great prices or their web site. Its worth the shipping wait, which is super fast. If someone has complained about it they are either lying or have had too many skin problems during their life. This stuff is all natural, and pure. I have been using their products for several years. Teri in Houston, Texas</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed it for a few years and it has been great.  A friend thought it was too harsh on her face but I think that can be avoided as long as you really do relax while it is working and do not move around :)</li>
    <li> The kit should have involved dead sea powder, and an activator, so that you can make a mask. When the package arrived I had the moisturizer, the activator, the serum, but no powder. Just called Amazon customer service, and a new package was at my door next day! Nicely packaged product, looking forward to using it after these reviews.</li>
    <li> Wow! The first time I used this product I thought \\&quot;I don&#x27;t have time to sit or lie down for 30 minutes for this to dry.\\&quot; After getting through the 30 minutes, I couldn&#x27;t believe my own eyes.  I saw a huge difference and decided that 30 minutes was nothing for what this kit does for your face.  The results were so remarkable that I purchased another Non-Surgical Face Lift Kit for my mother on Mother&#x27;s Day.  All I can say is Wow!  A must try!</li>
    <li> Have been using this twice a week for about 4 weeks. I doubt that I will bother to use it again. I really dislike the way it works. As it dries, it pulls your facial skin so tight that the surface of the product cracks, you can&#x27;t move any part of your face at all, even your mouth, and by the time it is to be removed you look like a hideous zombie. You could seriously scare people looking like that. I don&#x27;t see how that could possibly be good for your skin. Furthermore, I have seen absolutely no difference in the appearance of my skin. If there is any change at all, it is only for a few minutes immediately after the concoction is removed, and does not last. I probably will just throw the rest of it away.</li>
    <li> Although I am unable to buy it again.  Too bad because it was a great product.</li>
    <li> Everything was great. Love the product but they didn&#x27;t send the brush. Was excited to start it and had to go buy a brush to apply.</li>
    <li> This product seems to me is a bad imitation of  the real thing: &amp;#34;Distinction&amp;#34; by Leigh Valentine.  DOESN&#x27;T EVEN GET CLOSE TO WHAT IT PROMISE TO DO.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!!  I was surprised at how I looked after a treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Looked like I had slept 4 hours.  Rested and relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;My skin was so soft and smooth.  I sat on a recliner with my feet up and&lt;br /&gt;rested for 30 minutes when I put the solution on my face.  I felt like I had had&lt;br /&gt;a facial.  It was wonderful.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I started using it last night.  So far it is working.  It was easy to use, I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> My skin is not very saggy, baggy or wrinkly. But face it - after 50, there&#x27;s going to be some wear and tear on your kisser. I&#x27;m skeptical of these types of products. The ones which \\&quot;work\\&quot; always have some sort of drawback (leave a white film behind; crack or distort it you touch your face after it dries). I bought this because of the many great reviews on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took some before and after shots of my face during each step. It really did soften it up and gave my skin and very light lines a little plump, plus it looked rather fresh. I didn&#x27;t feel any pulsing but that&#x27;s OK. This masque pulls your skin up and back so much when drying, you could only get the same visual effect by sticking your head out the car window with your doggie going 70mph. (No, you won&#x27;t look like Norma Desmond or Joan Rivers. Your face will relax after the masque is washed off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all, it&#x27;s a thumbs up for me. Certainly the best skin care system I&#x27;ve used since crossing the 50 line. Not at all like the TV huckster stuff. I will continue to use it and after one month will do some more shots of myself.</li>
    <li> Great products. They work! I love the mask because it really pulls out the debris and the serum tightens the skin.</li>
    <li> It makes your face and skin really soft and supple. I am quite pleased and use it often. I will be buying it again!</li>
    <li> I love this product. After reading many positive reviews I decided to give it a try. The product arrived quickly and was beautifully packaged exactly as shown. I was anxious to try it right away! Mixing up the face lift was simple and took only moments. The enclosed brush made it very easy to apply. The directions are simple and easy to follow. I sat back and watched a movie while the product worked its magic. You feel a slight pulse as the mask dries and tightens. After 30 minutes the mask rinsed off easily with water and left no residue. I then applied the moisturizer and serum. I use the moisturizer twice a day. It is non-greasy and leaves the skin feeling soft. Since receiving the product I have used it three times and love the way my skin and face feel afterwards. I am 52 years old and look much younger than my age, but was starting to see sagging jowls and deepening smile lines. I had cystic acne in my youth and have many scars on my face which accentuate age lines. I can see a very subtle softening of the scars and the age lines aren&#x27;t as prominent as they used to be since using the Dead Sea Face Lift Kit. I will continue to use this product in hopes that it keeps working its magic. It&#x27;s also an inexpensive and safe way to feel great!</li>
    <li> wonderfull ,don&#x27;t like the price jumping around, getting crazy.I won&#x27;t be paying 950.for it.</li>
    <li> Hi If you want instant results use this product! If you do not have a lot of time this is a great product to give you a lift and make you feel fabulous.</li>
    <li> Worked as well as i expected.  I expect to reorder but I did not know a refill kit was available.  One always has too much of the activator left when the powder is gone.  Would be great if one could order individually.  Carmen</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because on the 1st use my face felt alive and on the 2nd use I really saw a difference.</li>
    <li> I am using as it is recommended and my face and chest are showing the results. This product is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Raquel</li>
    <li> This really works!!! Wow, five stars do not do this product justice. What a difference a day will make when you use this product.</li>
    <li> The price is great compared to some of the infomercial-type face creams &amp; peels I have purchased (and I&#x27;ve purchased a lot)! Kind-of feels like cement drying on your face but it comes off easily. I&#x27;ve had two comments recently that I look younger! Coincidence??</li>
    <li> It has realy a dramatic effect on the face itraied it on my mother face and she realy liked the result</li>
