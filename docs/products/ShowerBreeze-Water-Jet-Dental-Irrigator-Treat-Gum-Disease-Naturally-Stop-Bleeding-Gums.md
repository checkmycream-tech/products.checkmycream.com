<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I had been using a WaterPik for years.  Since I no longer wish to mount the WaterPik on the wall, now the WaterPik trips the circuit breaker if the countertop beneath it gets the least bit damp. Therefore I decided to try the ShowerBreeze, which I mounted on my hand shower. It can be adjusted to give as much or as little pressure as you desire.  (If you don&#x27;t use much pressure, it tickles your palate.)  It does the job silently, efficiently, and much more rapidly than the WaterPik.  It is also helpful for cleaning under fingernails and toenails.  Unfortunately it isn&#x27;t very attractive, therefore I gave it four stars instead of five.  I chose not to mount the tips on the shower wall because I don&#x27;t think mounting them would improve the overall appearance.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after my first scolding by my dentist.  I had to make another appointment about three weeks later and the was told that the improvement was noticeable- even after a short amount of time.  (I&#x27;ve been flossing more and rinsing more too.)  It was easy to put up.  I did end up getting an extension for my showerhead, because the addition of this made it difficult (not impossible) out of the caddy.  It included a holder but I did not hang it- I may in the future but I am the only one using it for now.  I forgot that the instructions suggest to use at half power and had it on full.  It does tickle when it is that strong.  I am using it now at about 3/4 (increasing a little as I get used to it).  It feels great after using it and I feel better after using it- cause I know that I am making my mouth better.  The only downside to this is when I want to use it other than when I bathe (I shower at night), I have to lean over the bathtub and it is a little awkward.  Now that I am using this style I do not think i would like the ones over the sink.  It would be too messy and I only have one bathroom (I don&#x27;t like guests seeing all of my personal items out).  I hope this review was helpful- this was one of the best investments I have made.  I will update this post if it is poor quality.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews online regarding the different types of water pics, I chose this shower model which seems to have been the perfect choice. I don&#x27;t have to worry about leaking water tanks or any electronic malfunctions. This device was as simple to install as advertised and everytime I use the device my mouth, teeth and gums feel like I just left the hygienist.&lt;br /&gt;This product is so awesome I bought two more as gifts for my sister and dad.</li>
    <li> About six months ago, my Dentist recommended that I get a Waterpik.  I did and liked it very much, except two things were not really great.  I used the portable one in the shower but you had to fill it three times and its battery ran out every week.  So then I was looking for something like Shower Breeze [[ASIN:B003ES2HNI ShowerBreeze w/ 6&#x27; Hose Water Jet Dental Irrigator]] and since I have had it I am definitely pleased.  It does the same job of cleaning my teeth but it also never needs battery charging and it doesn&#x27;t run of liquid as long as my shower stays on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to congratulate Shower Breeze on a product that is well made.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, much easier than using the other options for cleaning under bridges.</li>
    <li> I chose to try this out after my old countertop WaterPik finally gave out. I was a bit worried about installation at first since we have a \\&quot;strange\\&quot; dual-showerhead. I was pleasently surprised that installation with the included (yay!) pipe tape was a breeze, took less than ten minutes. Warning - be prepared to giggle uncontrollably the first couple times you use the Showerbreeze, it TICKLES!! But, as promised in the instructions, your gums will quickly get used to the \\&quot;stimulation\\&quot;. I&#x27;m looking forward to my next cleaning so I can find out for sure how healthy my gums are thanks to the Showerbreeze. A great investment for the health of your gums and the cleanliness of your countertop!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best product I could have ever purchased The company sent instructions via e-mail, also in the box. They were not necessary took less than 5 minutes to install.&lt;br /&gt;Now the pressure everyone seems to complain about is so easy to adjust, turned it on a little at a time let the spray hit the shower wall an you can see how hard or soft its coming out very easy.&lt;br /&gt;In 3 weeks the pockets in 2 of my teeth have filled in as my gums are so healthy, my mouth has never felt cleaner. So much better than any water pick. Also this product is Quality metal not plastic I can&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;see it ever breaking, ( sorry guys won&#x27;t help your sales ) although you should be very proud of your made in America product. Sincerely, Alexander J. Czimback</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I discovered this product on Amazon.  It is much better than a counter top water pic because:&lt;br /&gt;1) it works just as well&lt;br /&gt;2) no need to bend over the bathroom sink while using it to avoid making a mess&lt;br /&gt;3) it is relatively inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;4) it is less likely to break because of the simple design&lt;br /&gt;5) I use it a lot more often because doing so is quick and easy and&lt;br /&gt;6) the company that sells it provides exceptionally good customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is such a good deal that I&#x27;d still be completely satisfied even if it had cost me twice as much.  If you&#x27;re not sure if you want this or a counter top water pic, I think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised with how much better the ShowerBreeze is than a more expensive Water Pic.  I got the model with the 6 foot hose.  That extra length allows me to use it to clean the shower and it&#x27;s just nice that I&#x27;m never too far away from the shower head while using it.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the irrigator took all of the otherwise excellent water pressure from my shower, and as the hole in the device is small and the coupler is metal, it would be hard to make it any larger. Thus, I had to take it out in order to get my shower back to normal pressure. Too bad; it was a great idea.</li>
    <li> I really wanted a waterpik, but had NO counter space, didn&#x27;t want to worry about cleaning a reservoir, and also didn&#x27;t want to worry about the possible spray-mess.  I got on Amazon, read the reviews, and decided to try a ShowerBreeze with the 6&#x27; hose so I could also use the hose to clean my tub-shower combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried it out cleaning off shower scum - and BAM, did it ever!  So, if it peeled off shower nasty grime with ease, I figured I might as well give it a whorl on my teeth.  It tickled a little bit upon first use, but I found I liked the extra clean feeling I got after using it, so I incorporated it daily into my morning shower and teeth brushing routine.  The gum tickling feeling eventually went away, and my gums seem to be more resilient, and I don&#x27;t seem to get plaque build-up on my teeth (though an electric toothbrush always helped on that).  I never had an issue with my gums, but my dentist did make a point of commenting on how good they were upon my next visit after getting the ShowerBreeze.  I also noticed a poster for the ShowerBreeze or some similar product on the wall of the dentist&#x27;s office, so it&#x27;s a legit product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward two years, and the end tip broke right in half.  Not sure if it&#x27;s because of my water pressure, or just daily use for two years, but I was bummed.  I researched my alternatives on Amazon, but either they were just a tiny bit cheaper and much lower rated with breaking issues, or they were WAY more expensive and required replacing battiers to use.  All in all, I came to the same conclusion I did 2 years ago when shopping - the ShowerBreeze w/ 6&#x27; hose is just the most bang for your buck.  So I added another to my shopping cart on Amazon, but on a lark decided to email the company first to ask if maybe I could just buy a new tip rather than I whole new unit, explaining what had happened.  Within 20 minutes of emailing them explaining the conundrum (but without having bothered to look up an order number or any of that), a company rep had emailed me back telling me they had mailed me a replacement tip, and wrote directions for how to install.  Three days later, the package arrived with SEVERAL replacement connectors, tips and o-rings, it installed just as easily as the rep had written, and I&#x27;m back in business - just in time, I was already sorely missing my morning dental irrigation!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short?  I do love my dental irrigation, decided the ShowerBreeze was the best bang for your buck twice over, and their customer service has won a lifetime customer.

    <li> There are lots of great reviews here, and my 5-stars points to me loving this item, as well, so I will try to point out some different things than other reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The unit I received has a tightly coiled hose, not a straight one as seen in the current photo. (maybe the straight is from their 3&#x27; model?) I think the coiled is more convenient, as it \\&quot;stores\\&quot; easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. When using mine, I can only turn the diverter maybe halfway, before the pressure is too strong for my gums. This allows the water to continue to flow from my showerhead. If you like this, great (you can still have warm water on your body, while you \\&quot;breeze\\&quot;); If you don&#x27;t like this, here is a solution: use a a low-flow showerhead (1.5 or 2 gpm - they may be harder to find, but are worth it) and make sure the showerhead has a \\&quot;pause\\&quot; option. Both of mine do and I just use that when I want the water to stop (or slow significantly, when shaving, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The ShowerBreeze is also great for cleaning \\&quot;nooks and crannies\\&quot; in your shower (soap dishes, holding bars, gunk on shampoo container lids); and it feels good to spray on my toes, too. On low pressure it might be helpful when cleaning under your fingernails (mechanics, painters, potters, etc)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I have noticed a significant improvement in my overall oral health and well-being. As \\&quot;proof\\&quot; of this, I visited my dentist twice: a month before I received my ShowerBreeze and a month after I began using it. I take pretty good care of the things in my mouth, but the month before I began \\&quot;Breezing\\&quot; I still had some deeper pockets (4&#x27;s, as they call them at the dentist&#x27;s office) around some molars. I was happy to discover that a month after I began \\&quot;Breezing\\&quot;, my 4&#x27;s had turned to 3&#x27;s and 2&#x27;s, and I got high marks from the dentist on overall oral health. The only thing I changed in that timeframe was that I began \\&quot;Breezing\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. It is very easy to install. I did it myself (couldn&#x27;t wait for my beau to install). The directions were thorough, in plain english, with diagrams and the company even sent me a \\&quot;welcome email\\&quot; with a video, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. I don&#x27;t use the hangey-uppy thing. I just put my tips on my wire shower caddy, and hang the hose there, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. I like my ShowerBreeze so much that I bought a RediBreeze for when I go on vacation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found Oral Breeze to be a great company and have even purchased directly from them when others on Amazon were selling the Oral Breeze products at a lower cost (or, right now, a higher cost). For the best service (as indicated by feedback score, and personal purchasing experience), make sure you are buying yours from Oral Breeze (the listing will say: \\&quot;Sold by Oral Breeze, Inc.\\&quot; under the words \\&quot;In Stock\\&quot; on the Product Page) I can say, from personal experience, Oral Breeze supports their customers and has always responded to me quickly and thoroughly when I have contacted them. It&#x27;s rare that I am so happy with a company or a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rely on reviews here at Amazon to help me make informed buying choices.

    <li> Original Review: I give this product a 5 for the clever idea but a 3 for implementation.  Although generally of high quality (brass diverter and the new-style coiled 6&#x27; tubing), the handle and tips are problematic.  I ordered two extra tips and of the four one shoots out water at the joint, two dribble, and one seems OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of the four tips have wildly differing spray patterns. The cleverness of the design outweighs the quality shortcomings, though, especially since it is a shower unit so who cares if the water goes all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The low pressure high volume approach takes a little getting used to if you are used to the low volume high pressure approach of a Water Pik.  The overspray on to the roof of the mouth is indeed maddeningly ticklish but I imagine that will become bearable after a few weeks of adaptation. The massaging effect of a pulsating Water Pik is definitely more pleasurable and arguably more thorough, but again, the simple shower convenience still wins out with a &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34;. Having it handy means it will be used everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they had not used a flow restricting valve for the diverter.  Everyone already is going to have a flow restrictor in their shower head except those that don&#x27;t want a flow restrictor.  My guess is that it was the only kind they could source. Fortunately, the valve is easily disassembled and not so easily modified (drill out the valve vane). I don&#x27;t imagine this being much of a problem if you are already using a flow restricted shower head and are used to it. It probably won&#x27;t make any difference then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as already mentioned by others, use a washer when installing if you have one handy or at least put many layers of the teflon tape or it will probably leak if only hand tightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the combined shower/sink kit but after seeing the mess it makes I am not even going to open the sink version.  The shower one is the way to go and definitely get the 6foot version especially now that they are using a nicely compact coiled tubing.  The added length opens many imaginative use possibilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After a month of use I have become very fond of the 6&#x27; Shower Breeze.  I also want to temper some of my criticisms.  The leaky tips would all be fixed free under their warranty (I had some better o-rings so I fixed them myself) so that should not put anyone off.  The spray style used is pretty much a safety requirement for a device which will have variability in the source pressure of different users. You can&#x27;t really hurt yourself like you could if the spray was more needle-like and you had a very high water pressure source. It is definitely adequate in pressure in normal use and moving it rapidly back and forth during use does simulate pulsating.  Also, most importantly, the tickling does go away after using it a while (or at least I don&#x27;t pay attention to it anymore). This is a very good and effective product. I do wish the Oral Breeze owner who monitors the reviews here would stop clicking on the unhelpful button whenever he sees a negative review (in an attempt to drop them to the back of the default review queue).  Work on fixing the minor problems reported instead. It only needs a few improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Not a problem just an observation.  In normal use the spray openings in the tips will gradually wear out (6-8 months in my case) so it is a good idea to include a spare set when you order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: It looks like they did fix the tip o-ring problem as of Jan 2013 according to the new product description. And a new valve is mentioned and the picture does look like it could be flow through rather than restricted.  If so, then great and this is truly a 5 star product. It only took 2 years...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Also they have discontinued the nice coiled plastic tubing in favor of straight tubing. Should still work fine just not as good looking and now gets in the way of squeegeeing the showerwall.  Finally, I installed another one and I can say the valve is now non-restrictive and much better quality.  At this point I would raise the rating to 5-stars.</li>
    <li> This was my second oral breeze. My first one lasted about a year and my second one had a hole in the hose  when it arrived</li>
    <li> Product is good. I think it is good for our teeth. But problem is the breeze tip. It was made on plastic. The hole was damaged and irregular circle. I can still use it. I think the material of tip must be improved.</li>
    <li> Installation was easy, shower water pressure seems normal (but I had good pressure to begin with, and a good shower head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic bit with hooks where you&#x27;re supposed to hang the picks arrived broken, probably from the weight of the valve part shaking around in the package. I wasn&#x27;t planning on putting adhesives on my shower walls anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Idea for the manufacturer: Make a plastic clip that lets you clip the hose to itself. I&#x27;d prefer that over the current hook plate that needs adhesives or nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water tickles like crazy at first, but you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying the shower version was definitely the right move, I can&#x27;t even imagine the mess I&#x27;d make if this thing was just hooked up to a sink.</li>
    <li> I love this device!  It&#x27;s easy to use and very effective. Easy to install. Good quality too. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have to be fanatical about my dental hygiene to keep myself out of the dentist office!  But using a waterpik is a mess and takes up too much space on my bathroom counter.  I saw the ShowerBreeze and I was sold!  This really is as good as other reviewers say.  Thank you for inventing this!!!  It is great!!  I really am pleased.  Please do not stop making this product!  (Although my dentist might not agree.)  My husband had no trouble installing this and he uses it as well which is great since he can&#x27;t get floss between his teeth since they are set so close together.</li>
    <li> I love this thing! No big machine on my bathroom counter to clean...runs off my shower. Works great! Do not use a wrench to install but if you miss that warning you blind. It is plastered every where! Great product! My only annoyance is that the sticky shower mount that you use to hold the pic does not stick well after a while. The moisture, cold and warm environment tend to make it become unstuck so to speak. I was sticking to my tile above and over out off the way but still...clang! in the morning it falls..I am going to find a different hanging/mount option but the device itself functions flawlessly. Considering buying one as Christmas gift for family. My teeth look great...I am considering a modeling career now. HaHa</li>
    <li> I initially bought a countertop model waterpik because my hygeniest recommended it.  Its still on my countertop collecting dust because I could never be bothered with it.  You have to make a concerted effort to use it.  Fill it up, turn it on and hope that you get thru all your mouth before the water runs out.      The showerbreeze, however, works whenever i&#x27;m in the shower.  Just turn the nozzle and I have as much water as I need.  Plus I get much more pressure than the waterpik, but I have really good water pressure. I never run out of water.  I don&#x27;t feel like its an effort to use it, so I use it every day.  And now I can get rid of the waterpik and get more counter space.</li>
    <li> I really do like this product and have bought it a number of times over the years. However, keep in mind that it will not last long. I&#x27;ve had to replace it due to cracks in the joint that hooks up to the nozzle. Customer service is great and they will replace it, but I finally gave up after my fifth set.</li>
    <li> The kit is so simple that I am surprise it works, until my friend commented that my teeth is brighter after 2 months of use. Doubtful in the beginning, I use it every time I shower because it&#x27;s conveniently located. It&#x27;s easy, fast &amp; water pressure adjustable. I also use it also to clean the shower walls after me. The 6&#x27; cord is a must. (There a two different types of kits, one with 3&#x27; cord, another with 6&#x27;)</li>
    <li> Update:  The diverter on my water jet started leaking.  Oral Breeze has a wonderful policy of returning the defective jet with $10 and they will replace it.  I received it within a few days.  BTW, I&#x27;m still thrilled with it.  My hygentist said I no longer have to floss as this is doing such a great job and never plaque or bleeding gums.  I used to go to the dentist every 3 months!  I have recommended it to countless friends who have my same opinion.  I see some complain about the water pressure lessening but I haven&#x27;t found that to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dental hygentist has been after me for years to actually use the water pik setting on my sink, but it is just way too messy.  I found this water jet  on-line and I have been extremely pleased with the results.  After using it for several months, when my hygentist did her surveillance my next visit, she was pleased to see I had no bleeding gums nor plaque.  When I told her what I was using she was delighted and asked for the website to share with her other patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a money back guarantee and definitely a win-win purchase.</li>
    <li> Before reading my original review (below), know that we gave this product a second chance. The same problem, discussed below, reoccurred in record time (two months). Hence, I am advising all parties to stay away from this product, unless they are prepared to machine their own control handle out of real metal. This pretty much means stay the heck away from the ShowerBreeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I am the owner of a well equipped machine shop, I will be making a new handle from a billet of 3/4\\&quot; diameter, 6061 aluminum. It will reliably retain a set screw for the ages to come. I will also be inserting a SS spring pin in the base of the new handle to act as a stop, which is what caused the handle to crack to pieces in the two original cheap-a** plastic handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rest assured, the manufacturer and distributor know this is a piece of junk. They just don&#x27;t care. In turn, Amazon should cease distributing it for them until they make proper changes to the quality of the device. This is not brain surgery, just make the handle out of brass and put some chrome on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have changed this review from three stars to one star, only because I could not figure out how to give it a \\&quot;zero stars\\&quot;, for total lack of integrity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now begins the original review, which still contains useful info for those that will insist on going forward with this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our first Water Breeze has gone to water pick heaven. That pretty chrome control handle is not real metal, just plastic with chrome flashing. The set screw for the handle came loose, perhaps due to the fact that it took a lot of force to turn the handle. The set screw was biting into a soft nylon valve control stem, again, not metal. It was bound to fail under those conditions. The threads in the handle stripped when re-tightening was attempted. The threads may have been near-stripped in the factory, for all we know. In any event, there was not enough threading there to allow for a re-tightening that was going to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife loved the Water Breeze and used it almost daily in the two and a half years of service we got from the device. I enjoyed using it occasionally myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both longed for a 50% smaller orifice in the jets. We want to clean our mouths at highest pressure, but please, don&#x27;t drown us in the process. I can&#x27;t believe they are still selling the same darned jets at this time. Perhaps it is a safety issue. A tighter jet could be dangerous to the naked eye? Water Pik seems to get it right. Why can&#x27;t Water Breeze?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have a wall mounted, hose-to-shower-head type installation condition. This is a little tricky. To install, or to remove the device, I must remove the shower head hose, unscrew the 90 degree hose mount fitting from the shower wall along with the nipple behind that connects to the shower controls. The Water Breeze must then be pre-installed to the 90 degree fitting before re-installing the entire assembly to the shower control and wall of the shower. There is no clearance to do otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any time that an installation leaves me with a potential for a leak inside of a wall, where I cannot verify joint integrity until I see the wet spot in the wet plaster ceiling below, I am a nervous handyman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am loath to purchase another one of these devices, but I know it would please my wife to no end, so I will do it. The only other device, of similar function, that I have observed, is made entirely of plastic. It looks cheezy and surely cannot last any longer than this tidy chromed device, which blends well with our entire shower design of chrome and white tile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will never go back to the noise, clutter and mess of a counter top water pick. We are one with those that feel this way. We do wish for that tighter jet design and some tweaks in the quality of the Water Breeze. I would suggest a quality metal casting and longer set screw thread engagement for the control handle. I don&#x27;tthink I could possibly hope for a brass valve control stem to tighten that set screw down onto. I would be pleased to pay for the difference in cost of manufacture. The Water Breeze is a good concept. The product is helpful in the consistent battle for good oral hygiene. That is worth much more than the cost of this device on a year to year basis. If I ever see a better design, I will buy it and throw the current one away.</li>
    <li> The product does the job I bought it for and I plan to keep using it.  However, I measured a drop in shower pressure of 45%. This was with the value set to all shower and no water jet.  I demand a strong pressured shower head (bought a special shower head for that purpose) so this was disappointing.  With an in-line value there is no way to avoid a reduction in shower pressure but didn&#x27;t expect it to be that significant.  I&#x27;m now considering a twin-head shower system to get my old shower pressure back.</li>
    <li> -When it works, it works very well.  It is also effective for cleaning the grout around your tub.&lt;br /&gt;-The tips do not stay on during use, the fit is very loose.  The hose will fly off and it will dance around spraying water all over the ground.&lt;br /&gt;-The hose flew off of the valve end, causing a jet of high pressure water to shoot across the bathroom and drench everything.&lt;br /&gt;-A good idea but poor, poor, poor quality.</li>
    <li> Get the 6&#x27; hose and you&#x27;ll be happy.  I use this twice a day and it works perfectly.  Solid contruction, been using it now for over 3 months and no signs of wear and tear.</li>
    <li> We ordered this because we didn&#x27;t want a shower pik sitting on the counter. It was very easy to connect, and puts out a good spray for &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; the teeth. Very convenient!</li>
    <li> We love how this product works and the company was very customer service oriented.  There are only two issues to be aware of that may or may not be a problem for you.  First, our shower setup uses a close 90 degree elbow coming out of the wall.  We couldn&#x27;t install the diverter without taking it apart first and then re-installing the parts after the diverter was screwed on.  It&#x27;s not that big of a deal, but it does require a small adjustable wrench and the correct size Allen Wrench.  If you have a standard shower setup with more than about 1.5 inches of clearance between the wall and the end of the threaded pipe this will not be a problem.  Second, the diverter is not a full flow diverter.  It decreased water volume to the shower head in our application.  If you have a water saver shower head this will not be an issue.  If you have a full flow shower head it may be of some issue.  In our case it didn&#x27;t affect the flow enough that it was a problem for us.</li>
    <li> I used it and it worked fine, but.......I have implants and must irrigate underneath the implants.  This tickled so badly it almost made me ill.  I know that sounds weird, but it was very very unpleasant.  Apparently I must use a pulsating irrigator so I&#x27;ll stick to the waterpik.  I tried for 2 months to see if I could get used to it, but I never did.  In the meantime, it developed leaks and sprayed all over the place.</li>
    <li> i love this product. everyone should have one. it took minutes to install, it came with everything i needed to install except wrench. works great to go under my bridge. cleans sooo well. i purchased the other tips also, to have a variety for cleaning. excellent product&lt;br /&gt;thanks oral breeze&lt;br /&gt;kay</li>
    <li> First we got a faulty unit and once we got the new part it worked ok. BEWARE it reduces the water pressure at a significant rate. Our water heater started acting up and after months of thinking the water heater was broken and having a repair man come out for the water heater I decided to take the shower breeze off and voila the water heater was not acting up anymore. The Shower breeze did not let enough water through for our on demand water heater to turn on. I tried to return the unit but was not offered a refund boo....</li>
    <li> The showerBreeze works very well and is very powerful. So be careful when you used it for the first time not to have the jet full blast and too close to your gum. It will get where your toothbrush or dental floss can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Great product until I left the jet valve on but shower off. My wife went to shower, turned the water on firmly and was attacked by a ferocious striking water snake that  hit her _hard_ in the forehead. Very fortunate she wasn&#x27;t hit in the eye. So, product installed like a dream, convenient and effective, and a deathtrap for those married to numbskulls like me. Had to toss this nice product because can&#x27;t trust myself not to forget. Back to flossing (aarrgh)</li>
    <li> makes cleaning your teeth a breeze in the shower. Only takes a minute or two and feels great. No messy containers in your bathroom. What a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Dental irrigators have become popular in recent years, with some companies claiming them to be superior to floss. While they are a necessity to people with deep gum pockets or receding gum lines, this product should be used in CONJUNCTION with floss, otherwise you will not reap the full benefits of what the ShowerBreeze can do for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my first ShowerBreeze about a year ago, and have made it a permanent staple in my daily dental care regime. Every time I hop in the shower, I make sure to flip the switch and use the irrigator after conditioning my hair. The main reason I bought a ShowerBreeze is to clear out the occasional tonsil stone that gets caught in the deep crypts at the back of my throat. A dental irrigator is the BEST and MOST EFFECTIVE way to get rid of inaccessible mouth crud. A quick Google search will advise you to pickup a shower unit, since electric or sink-mounted irrigators can puncture delicate throat tissue and are too messy to use for anything beyond cleaning your gums. The 6&#x27; irrigator manufactured by OralBreeze is the most popular and recommended model on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite its usefulness, the ShowerBreeze is not without structural deficiencies. My hose leaks at both the connection to my shower head and on the pick itself. MAKE SURE to read the entire instruction manual during your initial install. Use as much Plumber&#x27;s Tape as needed to create a watertight seal on both ends of your valve switch (more is better than less in this case, despite what the directions may tell you). If you have never used a dental irrigator before, it takes a while to get used to the acute tickling sensation on your gums. If you plan to use the ShowerBreeze to clear tonsil stones, you will gag pretty hard if you aim the water stream anywhere other than your tonsil crypts. The best way to reach them is to stick your tongue out as far as you can, and press it down with two fingers, while using your other hand to carefully aim at the back corners of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shower adaptability renders messiness obsolete, and is more comfortable since you can adjust water flow and temperature manually. I had to replace my first dental pick a few weeks after I purchased my ShowerBreeze due to a big leak, and the company shipped me several replacement units that arrived a few business days later, all for free. This is a necessary product that cleans the inside of my mouth unreachable through other means. However, the ShowerBreeze could use a boost in manufacturing standards and consistency to create a more reliable product.ers of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shower adaptability renders messiness obsolete, and is more comfortable since you can adjust water flow and temperature manually.

    <li> Right away you&#x27;ll wish the tip was held with more than a 1/4 turn, as it constantly slips out of the hose. Then you&#x27;ll wish the hose came with a washer in the fitting so it didn&#x27;t leak like crazy as soon as you turn the shower on. After that, you&#x27;ll wish you could get a gum line tip for better irrigation between teeth and the gum line. Controlling the flow is ok, at least you can get decent pressure through it in comparison with some counter top water pick units. It&#x27;s less of a mess to do this in the shower, and easy to get the right water temp, so it makes for more overall use which is good. I&#x27;d still recommend it over other options, but it is far from perfect and only just worth the price. However, the issues I have with it were below expectations.</li>
    <li> Its been 4 days of using it and I can honestly say my mouth feels much cleaner. Im very impressed.</li>
    <li> I could not get the hose to attach to the line coming out of the wall for the shower head.</li>
