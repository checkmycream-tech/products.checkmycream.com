<li> We have a very similar wire in our Microcurrent machine, but upon arrival this particular wire did not fit into the machine.</li>
<li> They don&#x27;t last forever, but they last a long time if you take care not to pull on them where the wire connects to the part that plugs into your Tens unit.</li>

<li> Not much to say.</li>
<li> not the right wires for my device, unable to see the endings</li>
<li> Wires are generic so hard to make quality judgement.</li>
<li> Was a little bit weary about the price</li>
<li> So far they have lasted but now comes the time of year for heavy usage, and we&#x27;ll see, rather expensive tho, somebody&#x27;s going to the bank.</li>
<li> they work for a few months</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the material they use for the wires</li>
<li> Have used them daily without fail (2 to 6 hours per day) without fail for over a month now.</li>
<li> /&gt;The wire is disappointingly thin even given the price which is why I consider this a 4 star vs a 5 star product.</li>
<li> Wrong wire.</li>
<li> I resold the leads to another person as they were the wrong leads for my EMPI.</li>
<li> /&gt;Waste of money unfortunately.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought these for my tens unit because the cords started having problems keeping a connection, or the wires broke. They work great just like the original ones.</li>
    <li> The wires are of great quality.  Contact surfaces clean and free of any kind of oil to keep from tarnishing.  Wires are very durable and strong.  If you need replacement wires, these are the best I have found.</li>
    <li> works so good, I got two sets and I always get it at the same place all the time, because you can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
    <li> Well made, excellent for my tens unit.</li>
    <li> they work for a few months then they will have a short but it makes thing interesting  and surprising but i had to trash them eventually  i used them for at least 8 hours a day or more so i really pushed them to their limits i would drive with them on go to work and repair my computer since i would be sitting for long periods of time made it easier to play xbox360 .  we had a good run no  regrets</li>
    <li> Purchased for replacements on my Dynatronics TENS Unit.  Fit well; tested well.  Much better priced than other choices.</li>
    <li> bought these thinking that all lead wires are universal. Didn&#x27;t fit my tens unit I bought them for but did fit the other tens unit I am using now and gave a couple of inches more line than the one that came with the unit. So it worked out. always make sure if you are buying lead wires that they will fit your unit. Definitely would recommend them to a friend.</li>
    <li> Perfect deal, shipped so quickly.. So happy it fit my T.E.N.S Unit which I usually have a hard time to find..</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet, bought as spare, but appear to be of good quality</li>
    <li> Works well with my older tens unit.  I have the ability to use 4 leads but only have two so these were bought it use with the set I already have.&lt;br /&gt;The work well.</li>
    <li> did not work on my machine! I specifically stated what machine I had and they still sent wires that would not work on my machine.</li>
    <li> So glad that I was able to find these replacement wires. The price was really great and I will buy more to stock up on, since I use my unit just about everyday. Thanks!</li>
    <li> perfict fit for replacement wires for my TENS unit.</li>
    <li> Work well in all Tens, EMS, and Interferential modes.  Have used them daily without fail (2 to 6 hours per day) without fail for over a month now.</li>
    <li> Just a Heads up for you: These lead wires were wired in reverse of what i believe is the standard/right way . These are &#x27;Sleeve&#x27; positive (anode) and &#x27;Tip&#x27; negative (cathode). Standard practice is to wire the Sleeve negative, Tip positive.   Strangely, their 60\\&quot; Leads are wired the correct way!   If you are using AC current then it MAY not matter but if you are using DC current it definitely DOES matter...</li>
    <li> Good lead wires are Essential to the SAFE use of a T.E.N.S. unit. If the connection is Bad, the energy will Build Up and Release itself in a very Dangerous amount of Voltage, once the bad connection is restored by wiggling the wires, etc. This is Especially true, if the leads are near your Heart. You should NEVER pick up a T.E.N.S. unit up by the wires, or do anything else to Risk stretching and Breaking the wires.</li>
    <li> Perfect replace your ReliaMed product with these.  Ideal lenght and correct fit of the plug.  Just what you need! ++++</li>
    <li> not the right wires for my device, unable to see the endings and they did not match when i opened.</li>
    <li> Wrong wire. Needed the older 2-hole prong wires to plug into the unit. How do I return them? No longer have the packaging.</li>
    <li> I have bought these before from this vendor and will buy them again. They don&#x27;t last forever, but they last a long time if you take care not to pull on them where the wire connects to the part that plugs into your Tens unit. The price is great and I received them quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the material they use for the wires or it&#x27;s how I handle it. But they tend to just stop working. I have had to order 3 pairs. The first pair, the wire by the head of the Jack would be on and off. The second pair, both just stopped working. No idea if it was just faulty. The 3rd set seems to be holding out pretty well. I am paranoid that it will just stop working. But so far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to suggest not buying this brand. They may all be like this, and prone to break spontaneously. Unless they state high end quality parts and such I believe it&#x27;s all the same. Just do yourself a favor. And buy 2 pairs.</li>
    <li> A perfect replacement part. I firmly believe in repairing and re-purposing as much as we can to decrease our carbon footprint. The old wires are being used to hold up some bird houses in the garden and the new ones are keeping the TENS unit working.</li>
    <li> Perfect just what I ordered. They work get on my tens unit. All my order was recieved sooner than I was told.</li>
    <li> Unit post could be deeper for certain brands but the pad post are fine, I like the long leads. Incorporating a clip to keep leads from dangling would be a nice feature</li>
    <li> I needed to replace the lead wires to my Tens unit and these were perfect.  they were the same as the wires that originally came with the unit and I  was completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> I was searching for replacement lead wires for my older TENS unit. The Reliamed 45&amp;#34; Lead Wires were the best price and a perfect fit for my unit.  I was surprised regarding the timely delivery and good quality of the product .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will re-order the Reliamed 45&amp;#34; Lead Wires when I need additional replacement lead wires for my TENS unit.</li>

    <li> It is always helpful to have extra wires when you travel alot, and 45&amp;#34; is enough length to work well.</li>
    <li> used as replacements for my reliamed TENS unit leads, these worked fantastically, and are of high quality.  they are high quality and equal to what came with the original purchase.  well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Two sets of wires, inexpensive and fit my Tens unit perfectly. Was a little bit weary about the price but they work and that what matters.</li>
    <li> I use this after my exercise so that I will not have the pain and it help me release the pain out after the massage</li>
    <li> These lead wires work great with my Tens Unit at a terrific price. So glad to find them for sale on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Needed replacement leads for my TENS unit&#x27;s worn leads, and these have been great, meeting or exceeding OEM quality.Very happy camper!</li>
    <li> Quality is what you expect given the price and they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine knowing its not compatible with my EMPI SELECT.  I wanted to fashion a quick and cheap tens lead extension cable using this wire, the female connectors from worn out patches, and some butt connectors (stick both wires in and pinch with pliers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wire is disappointingly thin even given the price which is why I consider this a 4 star vs a 5 star product.</li>
    <li> Ordered them awhile ago. Never actually needed them. Untill recently. Not much to say. they work and are dirt cheap.</li>
    <li> Thanks.  They are perfect.</li>
    <li> They worked perfectly on my tens unit &amp; made it like brand new.  Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, I&#x27;ve had them for nearly a year and have had no problem.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised-- quality is fine. Wires are generic so hard to make quality judgement. a a a a a</li>
    <li> Being able to get replacement wires for my TENS unit was a GOD SEND!!!  It fit my unit which is about 8 years old perfectly fine!! Shipping was great and cost was incredible!! Will order a couple more just to have on hand!!  Thank You!!</li>
    <li> They work as well as originals (look identical), durable.</li>
    <li> Love the length, work perfectly with my TENS and TEMS units.</li>
    <li> These leads work good, they aren&#x27;t heavy duty but they are like the standard leads you get when you purchased the unit.</li>
