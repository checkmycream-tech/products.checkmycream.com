      <li>Have used it for many many years.  </li>
      <li>I have recommended it and just as satisfied as I am are those to whom I recommended Closys.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m looking to buy more, but now  I see  </li>
      <li>Simply the best I have ever tried, in one brushing the difference was like day and night.</li>
      <li>but I love that.  </li>

      <li>We all have free will to make our own choices, and I respect the choices of those who do not agree with me.</li>
      <li>Most notably, it seems to have somewhat of a moisturizing effect.</li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>My dentist recommended this many years ago, and I haven&#x27;t had any cavities or problems since.</li>
      <li>I love the taste.  </li>
      <li>We all have free will to make our own choices, and I respect the choices of those who do not agree with me.</li>
      <li>LOVE THE MOUTHWASH.  </li>
      <li>Refreshing and no bad chemicals!!</li>
      <li>I just wish they hadn&#x27;t added flouride, because I used to be able to buy it at Walgreen&#x27;s until all they had was the Closys with flouride.  </li>
      <li>I plan on follow up visits with my perio and dentist &amp; will edit my review after an appropriate 2 or 3 week trial.</li>
      <li>Closys is a very good toothpaste, cleans very well leaving your teeth clean &amp; mouth refreshed.</li>
      <li>But if you have healthy and strong gums this is a perfect toothpaste because it really cleans your teeth really well.</li>
      <li>The paste is rather dense, and doesn&#x27;t foam up as much as others, which I take to be a good sign since most toothpastes achieve a foaming affect using chemicals.</li>
      <li>it has kind of no after taste or fresh feeling</li>
      <li>I am probably more sensitive to the taste of chlorine, because where I live in Montana we have a well with awesome tasting water that is not chlorinated in any way.</li>
      <li>Minty and strong, but not burny or overdone like others</li>
      <li>The tongue scrapers are light and easy for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>After the first use, you notice that your teeth are squeaky clean &amp; the taste is quite nice.</li>
      <li>Do you need 3.4 ounces of Fluoride Free toothpaste?</li>
      <li>and the flouride free</li>
      <li>I chose this toothpaste because I was ordering the mouthwash and decided to try it because it if fluoride free.  </li>
      <li>I had been given a free sample of the rinse from my dentist.  </li>
      <li>Fluoride free.</li>
      <li>For those of us who believe that fluoride may well be detrimental to one&#x27;s overall health (perhaps you&#x27;ll have great teeth but a damaged body organ, with fluoride)</li>
      <li>The small size works perfectly for her.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t give you that.. fresh feeling that every toothpaste must have!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34;, but it works better than most of the natural pastes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>it makes my mouth feel clean.  </li>
      <li>Keeps your breath clean.</li>
      <li>But if you want a clean mouth?</li>
      <li>My mouth feels so clean.</li>
      <li>The combination of those two things did it and my gums now have a clean bill of health.  </li>
      <li>No need for fluoride if you keep your teeth clean.</li>
      <li>Toothpaste is smooth and mild minty flavor.</li>
      <li>Really works and keeps teeth clean and gums healthy.</li>
      <li>Have been using this toothpaste for the last seven years and no cavities, gums in good shape</li>
      <li>This made brushing my teeth far more comfortable, well, as comfortable as one can be when they have canker sores.</li>
      <li>No bad additives.</li>
      <li>/&gt;In fact, since it was fluoride free I went ahead and used it right after I opened the box.</li>
      <li>I love my new gums!</li>
      <li>It leave you with a clean, fresh breath</li>
      <li>Perfect for a 3-1-1 bag, so I won&#x27;t have to buy any more of those tiny little less-than-one-ounce tubes.  </li>
      <li>There are great fluoride free natural toothpastes out there, with ingredients such as neem, tea tree, etc.</li>
      <li>Biotene has nothing on this stuff - it&#x27;s good for dry mouths, perhaps.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But believe me, this toothpaste tastes strongly of chlorine to me, much stronger than any chlorinated water I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>I  love this so far....(;</li>
      <li>The mouth rinse keeps your breath fresh for hours &amp; kills the bacteria that causes tooth decay &amp; reduces the formation of calculas</li>
      <li>I love it so far.</li>
      <li>I believe it does kill bacteria in your mouth and makes your mouth fresh.  </li>
      <li>(nothing like what I&#x27;m experiencing right now).</li>
      <li>it is good to have a fluoride-free option ... try to find that in conventional toothpastes which, lemming-like, include fluoride in almost all their product variations.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff - it&#x27;s highly recommended by my dentist for people who suffer from canker sores or have sensitive gums - you can&#x27;t get it anywhere around here, not at the drug stores, or Wal-Mart, no one sells it -</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
      <li>my gums are healthy and I can feel the difference CloSYS has made in the last three years that I have been using their products.</li>
      <li>He actually said my gums were &amp;#34;pink, healthy, and tight&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Never had such healthy gums</li>
      <li>And the more various toxins you put in your body, the more likely you are to experience symptoms from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>first of all, its good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad to have finally found a fluoride-free toothpaste that works just like the fluoride version, but without health-related setbacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s for sure enough to derail my whole body.  </li>
      <li>It is available in many stores but only a much larger size.  </li>
      <li>No new cavities and gums are healthy.  </li>
      <li>I proceeded to look up chlorine dioxide, and found that it can cause certain symptoms of toxicity in some people.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Closys has 3 things going for it.  The first is least obvious: it has a low abrasive factor so tooth wear from brushing is lower than many other toothpastes.  In the long term this is an important consideration.  Second is the chlorine dioxide technology which helps freshen breath and partially counteract plaque.&lt;br /&gt;Third is the fluoride-free aspect.  For those of us who believe that fluoride may well be detrimental to one&#x27;s overall health (perhaps you&#x27;ll have great teeth but a damaged body organ, with fluoride) it is good to have a fluoride-free option ... try to find that in conventional toothpastes which, lemming-like, include fluoride in almost all their product variations.  People SHOULD have the ability to opt out when it comes to fluoride and Closys is to be congratulated for producing this product.</li>
    <li> I was told by my dentist that if my gums didn&#x27;t improve that I would need a deep gum cleaning and/or oral surgery.  She suggested I use this product and start brushing the inside of my teeth and not just the outside.  The combination of those two things did it and my gums now have a clean bill of health.  My only complaint is CloSYS doesn&#x27;t emulsify as well as other toothpastes and the combination of that and having to keep my mouth open in order to properly brush the inside of each tooth results in some spotting on the mirror (more a problem of the technique rather than the toothpaste though).  IMO, it&#x27;s absolutely key to use the Oral B properly so each tooth gets brushed individually, both inside and out.</li>
    <li> Pleasant taste, not too strong and best of all no fluoride.  Great for anyone trying to avoid fluoride.  Enough with the fluoride!</li>
    <li> I have been using the closys mouthwash for years but had never seen the toothpaste until I came upon it by chance om amazon.  I love it so far.</li>
    <li> At first when I used the toothpaste it cleaned my teeth very good. But after a week of using the toothpaste it made my gums very irritated. I specifically got this toothpaste because I cut my gum tissue between my teeth with a plaque picker by accident. I thought this toothpaste would be gentle on my gums since everything that I eat or brush my teeth with just irritates the cut. Even the dentists I have been to so far don&#x27;t know how to fix my cut. Anyway, if you have a similar problem you may not want this toothpaste because over time it was make the inflammation worse. But if you have healthy and strong gums this is a perfect toothpaste because it really cleans your teeth really well.</li>
    <li> Since I have been using this products my dental exams have improved markedly.  I suffer from almost no plaque build up. my gums are healthy and I can feel the difference CloSYS has made in the last three years that I have been using their products.</li>
    <li> Product arrived a day earlier than promised by 2nd day air (Hawaii).  It is a product that I use on a regular basis. RN</li>
    <li> Really great toothpaste!</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste ever! I needed a sulfate-free, flouride-free paste.  Closys just plain works!  Strong enough to clean good, but doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause little sores like other so-called \\&quot;natural\\&quot; pastes.  I just wish they hadn&#x27;t added flouride, because I used to be able to buy it at Walgreen&#x27;s until all they had was the Closys with flouride.  Getting harder and harder to find the flouride-free Closys; Drugstore.com stopped carrying it also.  Amazon is the only place left.  Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do when they stop.  When ordering Closys toothpaste, if you want the flouride-free one, check very carefully, because the one with fl. will tear up your mouth.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is perfect for anyone allergic to the ingredient in toothpaste.  It is available in many stores but only a much larger size.  I purchased this side for my elderly mom who has severe arthritis.  The small size works perfectly for her.</li>
    <li> Finding a fluoride-free product that truly works is not easy. The unknown products sold at Whole Foods and such don&#x27;t help me at all. CloSYS is great. I used to have a lot of cavities and plaque build up. Now I don&#x27;t and I don&#x27;t have to use fluoride. We get enough in our water supply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad to have finally found a fluoride-free toothpaste that works just like the fluoride version, but without health-related setbacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this item!</li>
    <li> Contains sorbitol and I don&#x27;t like it because I think toothpaste that contains sorbitol is not good for our health.  I found out about this product in a book called \\&quot;Kiss your dentist goodbye\\&quot; The author recommends this toothpaste even if she thinks that we should not use products that contain sorbitol. Go figure!</li>
    <li> I do like this toothpaste--I haven&#x27;t gotten a canker sore since I started using it.  And I do love this size of 3.4 ounces!  Perfect for a 3-1-1 bag, so I won&#x27;t have to buy any more of those tiny little less-than-one-ounce tubes.  Thank you, CloSYS!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better toothpaste! Simply the best I have ever tried, in one brushing the difference was like day and night. Don&#x27;t even hesitate grabbing!</li>
    <li> it makes my mouth feel clean.  it doesn&#x27;t suds like reg toothpaste but I love that.  and the flouride free doesn&#x27;t make my teeth senistive or give me sores in the corners of my mouth. : )  I am a HUGE fan!!  Will def buy this from now on.</li>
    <li> I loved using this toothpaste when I was having issues with canker sores. I read that SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) can have a bad reaction with canker sores and make them worse. This made brushing my teeth far more comfortable, well, as comfortable as one can be when they have canker sores. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> first of all, its good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;doesnt really have smell too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but it doesn&#x27;t give you that.. fresh feeling that every toothpaste must have!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend!  Really helps sensitive teeth and gums. Refreshing and no bad chemicals!!</li>
    <li> travel-size , this is a great non-foaming toothpaste</li>
    <li> Really works and keeps teeth clean and gums healthy. Have used it for many many years.  Never had such healthy gums</li>
    <li> I got this for sensitive gums and it works very well for that. I like the minty taste too as well.</li>
    <li> Very good toothpaste for clean teeth and fresh breath.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Have been using this toothpaste for the last seven years and no cavities, gums in good shape and it also whitens.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My relative loves it. It is the only thing that makes her breath smell fresh. Her teeth are white I might add.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste, taste good..</li>
    <li> Leaves my mouth feeling incredibly fresh and seems to do a great job cleaning my teeth. Even my 2 year old likes it!</li>
    <li> Love the product. I have been using it for over 15 years</li>
    <li> this is for my sister she has used many other toothpastes but this one recommended by her Dentist works the best.&lt;br /&gt;It is not available in Canada so I usually bring some home for her.</li>
    <li> My family has been using this toothpaste exclusively for the past three years, and our dental health has never been better.  No new cavities and gums are healthy.  Teeth aren&#x27;t staying awesomely white, but they are not turning yellow.  No need for fluoride if you keep your teeth clean.</li>
    <li> I chose this toothpaste because I was ordering the mouthwash and decided to try it because it if fluoride free.  I had been given a free sample of the rinse from my dentist.  I rotate this toothpaste among the others that I use regularly.  I believe it does kill bacteria in your mouth and makes your mouth fresh.  It has no fluoride, which is the main reason that I purchased it..  It is a little pricey.  I may order again.</li>
    <li> I  love this so far....(;</li>
    <li> Closys is a very good toothpaste, cleans very well leaving your teeth clean &amp; mouth refreshed. The mouth rinse keeps your breath fresh for hours &amp; kills the bacteria that causes tooth decay &amp; reduces the formation of calculas</li>
    <li> This is the only alternative to fluoride toothpastes I&#x27;ve seen for grown ups but it doesn&#x27;t really cover up bad breath it has kind of no after taste or fresh feeling&lt;br /&gt;The plus side is there is no fluoride in it at all</li>
    <li> Our daughter who is holds a BS in dental hygiene recommended this product to the whole family, so I always go by her recommendations.</li>
    <li> I love the taste.  It&#x27;s just a little expensive for the size - hence the 4 stars instead of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste! Nice knowing its antibacterial properties are working. Less staining per my hygienist!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff - it&#x27;s highly recommended by my dentist for people who suffer from canker sores or have sensitive gums - you can&#x27;t get it anywhere around here, not at the drug stores, or Wal-Mart, no one sells it - plus, the one time I did find it (out of town), it was MUCH more expensive than online.  Amazon saves the day, again!  The mouthwash is great, too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s working for everyone else, but it has caused a serious problem for me.  To start with, it caused extremely dry mouth during the night the first time I tried it, which is already an issue with hypothyroid, bad enough to wake me up several times choking. I decided to give it one more try last night and it was just as bad.  I&#x27;ve only used it 2 days now and my heart hasn&#x27;t stopped racing.  It&#x27;s galloping like one does when scared, except I&#x27;m not.  Except for what has it done to me?  Yesterday I didn&#x27;t think about it being the toothpaste, and after 30 minutes of meditation and deep breathing last night got it to slow down enough to go to bed.  Brushed my teeth again, and within a few seconds of putting the paste in my mouth it started racing and thumping again. Yoga and exercise hasn&#x27;t helped today which it usually does with irregular heartbeat from hypo (nothing like what I&#x27;m experiencing right now). I&#x27;m researching ingredients - starts with water, then the silica abrasive, next is sorbitol so there must be a lot.  I didn&#x27;t even know what that was til I read so many complaints about it on Schiff Mega-Red last night that I&#x27;m afraid to buy it, apparently a lot of people have health issues with sorbitol. There&#x27;s also chlorine dioxide, trisodium phosphate, titanium dioxide, and sodium saccharin to research.  I&#x27;m just hoping 24 hours will get it out of my system and get back to normal so I won&#x27;t have to go to the doctor. I&#x27;ll give an update later.  If anybody else has experienced this reaction to CloSys, please let me know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update this afternoon - 4th ingredient is chlorine dioxide, used in water treatment plants. Chemical poisoning symptoms include rapid heartbeat, difficulty breathing, and nausea - all my symptoms.  The last ingredient is sodium saccharin, which is a sulfonomide, and allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing.  I am deathly allergic to sulfa, even the tiniest bit can make my heart try to jump out of my chest.  I don&#x27;t knowhow much of either of these is included but it&#x27;s for sure enough to derail my whole body.  What on earth is stuff like this doing in toothpaste?  Is there a truly safe one out there?</li>
    <li> I ordered four units. Received only one.</li>
    <li> Sorry to be one of the few &#x27;nay-sayers&#x27; here, but this is my first and last time using this toothpaste. I always use flouride free, and when I saw this I thought it might be another good option for me. Unfortunately I was not able to read the ingredients on the tube before I received it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, since it was fluoride free I went ahead and used it right after I opened the box. It tasted like I was brushing my teeth in chlorinated swimming pool water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I read the label and saw chlorine dioxide. I am probably more sensitive to the taste of chlorine, because where I live in Montana we have a well with awesome tasting water that is not chlorinated in any way. I have become so used to our clean, fresh water, that when I go back home to Ohio where I was raised (to visit family), I can only drink bottled water. I can taste the chlorine in my family&#x27;s water, but I never tasted it when I lived there and had it every day growing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But believe me, this toothpaste tastes strongly of chlorine to me, much stronger than any chlorinated water I&#x27;ve ever had. I proceeded to look up chlorine dioxide, and found that it can cause certain symptoms of toxicity in some people. (see [...]). And the more various toxins you put in your body, the more likely you are to experience symptoms from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to watch what you put in your mouth (you absorb a lot through the tissues inside your mouth), then you may want to stay away from this toothpaste. My mouth did feel clean after using this, but no cleaner than it does with the tooth powders and other natural toothpastes that I have used in the past. There are great fluoride free natural toothpastes out there, with ingredients such as neem, tea tree, etc. If you google those natural ingredients, also adding keywords such as &#x27;for teeth &amp; gum health&#x27; you will see for example that neem outperforms even chlorhexidine gluconate as an oral anti-bacterial. (Chlorhexedine is the most common ingredient in Anti-bacterial dental care products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are sick of hearing about all the stuff that&#x27;s bad for you, and you just want to live your life without worrying about it, I understand that. You may like this toothpaste, and you may not have any toxic reactions from it. We all have free will to make our own choices, and I respect the choices of those who do not agree with me. Personally I will never use this toothpaste again. Honestly, I would rather used fluoride!re products).

    <li> This is the only toothpaste my son will use.</li>
    <li> Together with the mouthwash, it eliminated our bad breath.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this product and I have been using it for the past six months.  I have recommended it and just as satisfied as I am are those to whom I recommended Closys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not change this product for any other.  It leave you with a clean, fresh breath and I noticed my teeth are even whiter.  The tongue scrapers are light and easy for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is magnificient.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about CloSYS, but I get a clean sensation that lacks the harsh chemical cleanliness I find in other toothpastes. Most notably, it seems to have somewhat of a moisturizing effect. The paste is rather dense, and doesn&#x27;t foam up as much as others, which I take to be a good sign since most toothpastes achieve a foaming affect using chemicals. It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34;, but it works better than most of the natural pastes I&#x27;ve tried. If you don&#x27;t scrutinize every ingredient and just want a toothpaste based on performance, CloSYS is the best I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of toothpastes.</li>
    <li> i have gingivitis, i have a dry mouth, this toothpaste takes care of the bad breath&lt;br /&gt;and stains on teeth.  I use it with my waterpik toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is toothpaste. Fluoride free. 3.4 Ounces of it. It does exactly what it says it does. Do you need 3.4 ounces of Fluoride Free toothpaste? Buy this product.</li>
    <li> I was slow to actually use Rowpar&#x27;s Closys products due to their cost, although they were first recommended to me by a dentist many years ago.  However, once I actually began using them in earnest I quickly realized their superiority, and the fact that cheaper products are almost a waste of time in comparison to the value Closys Flouride Free products deliver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rowpar&#x27;s Closys II Flouride Free Toothpaste is the best product on the market.  Leaves teeth noticeably cleaner and fresher even in the morning after sleeping all night.  When combined with use of CloSYS Oral Rinse (Alcohol-Free, CPC-Free, Gluten-Free), you have an unbeatable one-two punch against the germs.  CloSYS Antiseptic Oral Rinse kills 99% of bacteria and germs in seconds, stops bad breath on contact, and is alcohol free so there is no burning or drying.</li>
    <li> I bought several tubes of ClySys a couple of years back and am now on my last tube. The ingredients on the side claim the active &amp;#34;patented&amp;#34; ingredient is STABILIZED CHLORINE DIOXIDE, and no fluoride. Now I&#x27;m looking to buy more, but now  I see  Closys is advertised on Amazon in different ways, as A. CloSys Fluoride Toothpaste, or B. CloSys Fluoride Free Toothpaste. The numerous reviewers of #B often mention the importance of Fluoride Free, and indeed this item is described as &#x27;CloSys Fluoride Free Toothpaste&#x27; BUT reading down to &#x27;ingredients,&#x27; it says: &amp;#34;...contains the active ingredient SODIUM FLUORIDE...&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t see any mention at all of &amp;#34;stabilized chlorine dioxide,&amp;#34; which was its main selling point 2-3 years ago when I first started using this product. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m mystified and hope someone can  explain why a supposedly fluoride-free product contains as its main advertised ingredient &amp;#34;Sodium Fluoride.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using their mouthwash for over a year now and decided it was time to use their toothpaste. Wow. My mouth feels so clean. Why did I wait so long to get this?</li>
    <li> LOVE THE MOUTHWASH.  HATE THE TOOTHPASTE.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this many years ago, and I haven&#x27;t had any cavities or problems since. I really notice the cleaning difference when I run out and resort to other toothpastes. As we learn more about the toxicity of fluoride - its absence is a big plus.</li>
    <li> It tastes good, works great. My youngest son uses this too! No bad additives.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpaste!</li>
    <li> Because they just sounded too good to be true. How can any toothpaste make such a difference in your oral care? This one rocks. After the first use, you notice that your teeth are squeaky clean &amp; the taste is quite nice. Minty and strong, but not burny or overdone like others *cough* Crest* cough*colgate* I wanted a gentle toothpaste &amp; wished to get away from the flouride to help improve my gum health a bit. I plan on follow up visits with my perio and dentist &amp; will edit my review after an appropriate 2 or 3 week trial. So far? I&#x27;m blown away. It is a lil pricey and the tube is a tad smaller than the industrially churned out brands in groceries - but you use half and it really goes a long way. Biotene has nothing on this stuff - it&#x27;s good for dry mouths, perhaps. But if you want a clean mouth? Go CloSYS.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste I&#x27;ve used for about 12 years now. Both the toothpaste and mouthwash - - seems to keep my mouth cleaner and fresher than other toothpastes I&#x27;ve used.  If I happen to have an irritation inside the mouth - - Closys deals with it and it&#x27;s gone.  (irritations or soreness in the gum, not tooth problems) Until I find a reason not to, I&#x27;ll keep using this toothpaste. (it removes stains well, too)</li>
    <li> CloSYS is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I suffered from receding gums and gingivitis, which was quite severe.  I read about CloSYS and decided to give the toothpaste (non-fluoride) and mouthwash a try.  I have only used it a couple months, but had to visit my dentist to have a crown re-installed (popcorn!).  After doing so, he asked what I was doing because my teeth and gums looked great.  He actually said my gums were &amp;#34;pink, healthy, and tight&amp;#34;.  I told him about CloSYS.  He hadn&#x27;t heard of it and asked me to bring the boxes in so that he could study the products before recommending them to patients.  Thank you CloSYS!  I love my new gums!</li>
    <li> My Dentist recommended this toothpaste and I have used it for a long time.  It is the best ever.</li>
    <li> If you care about your oral hygiene please buy this product. Toothpaste is smooth and mild minty flavor. Keeps your breath clean. The same with the oral rinse. My gums were bleeding everytime I brushed my teeth, now it is very rare.</li>
