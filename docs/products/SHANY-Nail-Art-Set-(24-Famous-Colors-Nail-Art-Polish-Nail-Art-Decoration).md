<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have become very interested in doing my nails as of lately, this product seemed very good for price and quality and it very much is. I would recommend buying this nail polish if your looking for something fun and color full to use on your nails. The variety of colors is very nice there&#x27;s not one bad one. This is a great deal and I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I do</li>
    <li> Some of the nail polish were too thick.. would have loved them if all the nail polish were good..</li>
    <li> most where all dried up I should of returned them!</li>
    <li> great colors -- great price.</li>
    <li> The nail polish chips after only a day, even after applying a decent top coat over it. The brushes are absolutely horrible to use. They&#x27;re thin and many of them are not flat on the end, with stray brush strands sticking out making it impossible to get an even brush stroke. The colors are great, but not worth the effort for only a day of nice looking nails.</li>
    <li> Make your work easy with the convenient brush inside the color! I love it! You should try it! Now thanks!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for someone. They loved it and said it works very well and they were so excited about all the different colors!</li>
    <li> I bought this for the wife . She has been using it for several months now with no trouble ..&lt;br /&gt;seems to be a good product !! would buy it again .</li>
    <li> These are probably not the best quality art polish you can buy, but overall their positives far outweigh their negatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;There is a good variety of colors (both solids and glitters)&lt;br /&gt;The colors are all vibrant&lt;br /&gt;They come in a plastic stand that keeps them all well organized (thin plastic, just a store display, but very useful nonetheless)&lt;br /&gt;They seem last a decent amount of time before chipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I have run across a few bottles that are too thin and few more that are gooey&lt;br /&gt;Every once in a while the brush separates from the lid and has to be screwed in again&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t use these on stamping plates as the polish is generally too thin (it&#x27;s only listed as a con because the plastic tray they come on says to use Shany image plates for the best results)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the price I think you get a really good quality and great variety&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I&#x27;ve changed my review to two stars because I&#x27;ve found multiple bottles that are dried out and totally solid.  Plus, about half of these are so thin they don&#x27;t leave good lines and require several coats.  Not great for nail art and impossible for stamping.</li>
    <li> These are great, love everything about them down to their cute little holder and box. The colors go on smoothly, love the brush, and makes great designs! Couldn&#x27;t ask for more</li>
    <li> This is a super nice set. Very professional looking and cool, fun colors.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter uses it to &amp;#34;dress up&amp;#34; her manicure and pedicures. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Item as described</li>
    <li> Daughter loves them, it&#x27;s the ones you can do designs with</li>
    <li> I am a nail art beginner and even I know the difference between quality and this set!  I&#x27;ve tried to use two colors so far - the grey and the red.  And both brushes are messed up.  I am highly disappointed in this set.  I originally wrote two reviews based on how amazing they were packaged and after using the red regular color but the bad is far outweighing the good. The consistency of the polish itself is very inconsistent too - some too thin, some too thick.  Some bottles had glop all at the top of them like someone&#x27;s used them before as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend the money on a quality set!</li>
    <li> These nail art polishes are really great and work just fine! I&#x27;ve always loved doing designs on my own nails as well as to others, but I&#x27;ve never had the right tools. Now that I got these polishes and a couple of other tools I will be able to do all the designs I could do.</li>
    <li> Great colors! Shany nail art set smells &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; BAD! Why? Is this product &amp;#34;&amp;#34;safe&amp;#34;&amp;#34; for a girl to use?? In the second box i see after looking closely that the wrapper was broken.  May send back!</li>
    <li> Great starter product, some of the lighter colors and glittery ones are harder to see on reds and blues though, but nonetheless great</li>
    <li> I received my package on the 6/27/13 as a gift off of my Amazon Wishlist. The package came in a very well packed box and it was packaged so the bottles couldn&#x27;t move or spill. The colors are vibrant and beautiful and the nail brushes are big enough for proper application. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. The colors are so bright and there is such a large variety. The polish isn&#x27;t too watery or clumpy, it&#x27;s really perfect for nail art.</li>
    <li> Brushes are funky and difficult to work with. Polish dry and average time but some are too sheer looking</li>
    <li> This was given as a gift for a teenager who was just using mother&#x27;s old nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;Was so excited to receive the multitude of colors and will definitely pair it with the nail art that she was given.&lt;br /&gt;It made a cheerful, happy gift.</li>
    <li> Great price, great selection of colors! The quality of the polish is pretty good for this price (a little thin) and the brushes are great for most nail art. My only real problem is that after sitting for a couple months a few of the polishes dried up. I don&#x27;t think I left the caps loose. As a matter of fact I don&#x27;t think I ever even used some of the colors. But for $20 I can&#x27;t really complain. It&#x27;s still well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I got this to give as a gift and it shows in the picture a pretty black box, so I assumed it would arrive like that.  Instead the nail polish is on it&#x27;s own wrapped in plastic.  Really shabby.  I can&#x27;t give this as a gift now, since it&#x27;s not appropriate and looks cheap without a gift box.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I received the item in a timely fashion but that nice black box they show in the picture is missing. Instead, it&#x27;s encased in plastic and placed in a grody white box with packaging stickers all over it. Not the best thing to put in gift wrap for a present. Great colors, though.</li>
    <li> They got here quick and they were exactly what I needed!! I love love love this product!!!! And I love love love amazon!!</li>
    <li> The best nail kit I ever bought.  My teen is so stylish now!</li>
    <li> Just starting to do my own nail art. This set offers a wide selection of colors and for now, easier than the botles, brushes, etc. till I more experience. Thank you!</li>
    <li> the product came on time and not damaged (it was packaged properly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that the quality of the material used for nail polish is not good. in addition, the brushes are very thin and messy; not suitable for covering a nail nor for art design (some of them are good but most of them are not). the most drawback is that you can not return the item. I ordered this item just because it was not mentioned non-returnable (some other brands sell similar items described as non-returnable) and there is a piece of paper inside the box which said this item should be returnable but the return option is inactive for this item. I would never recommend this to adults (even not to teenagers). I feel like a real loser!</li>
    <li> I absolutley LOVE this product. It came with the black box and everything in the picture. All of the colors are what you see on the picture nothing is duplicated or in bad condtion;) I do my toes every 3 days and do different patterns! i love them and get compliments on them as well. I highly reccomend this product for ladies/men who like to design and be creative with nails/toes. It works wonders in the summer time and it looks as if you been to the nail shop! 10 stars in my book!</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and I&#x27;m loving it. The floors are bright and just right for this summer.</li>
    <li> I have been a hairstylist for six years and after numerous requests from clients about acrylics i decided to start doing them. I find so many great items on amazon and they ship fast! I loved this set it works great and looks very professional on my manicure table. One color the black was not good but that was the only problem. This happens sometimes in shipping or while sitting too long i will simply clean the brush and bottle out and pour my other black in it or just toss it out.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS NAIL ART KIT!!! There are so many beautiful bright colors to choose from. The quality of the polish is outstanding!</li>
    <li> The colors are so cute and with the nail design stencil kit this would be the perfect gift for someone!</li>
    <li> I got them within a week from ordering them. The amazon box was totally beat up when I received it, but the contents were perfectly intact.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are really nice and vibrant! They need a couple of minutes to dry if you don&#x27;t have them directly under a fan, but it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the price and totally fun!</li>
    <li> I bought this pack a couple months ago, and at first I was very happy with it. I loved the bright colors and it came quickly in perfect condition. But later I noticed that within a day or a couple days it would peel off. I decided that it wasn&#x27;t the nail polish fault and that I would go out and by a good quality top coat to protect it. Well after painting my nails with the polish and layering it with a top coat I went out to the mall. Within a few hours entire nails that were previously painted had lost all their polish. I am very upset because I love these colors and had high hopes for this set. Now I use these polishs for practicing sense they peel off so quickly! I do not recommend this set if you are expecting long lasting polish.</li>
    <li> Very affordable and I like the display. The colors are dense and thick, making it great for design</li>
    <li> OK, so one was opened and leaked out a bit. Need to place a sticker over cap to stop this in shipping. I love the colors, however the quality is poor. I own a nail salon, been at it for 12 years, this is just not worth the money. The polish was thick right out the gate and the brushes do not have a clean tip. Meaning the &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; are not all the same length, so making those perfect lines just wont happen with it. I still kept the polish but I have to thin some of them with acetone and use my nice nail art brushes. So all n all not total crap just not worth the money.</li>
    <li> They are very dull and you can barely see the color. Not a good quality at all. Please pay a couple dollars extra and get a better quality set. I would not recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> This might be okay for a kid but for anyone looking to make some nice nail art designs with this polish find something else. many of mine were too thick and lumpy to use and the brushes are terrible. Paint took forever to dry also. Just terrible product.</li>
    <li> Somewhat watery polish</li>
    <li> The nail polish is cheap but really good. The colors give ur nails a sparkle which really amazed me. It also has a really cute holder.😄😃</li>
    <li> Received it in the mail yesteday....It&#x27;s completely sealed, yet the box smells of nail polish, but I didn&#x27;t notice any leaks like other buyers stated.  I did notice that one of the polishes is more than half empty, which I don&#x27;t understand since it is sealed up.  I&#x27;m giving this to my daughter for Christmas, so hoping there are no issues when she opens the box.</li>
    <li> Would buy this set again</li>
    <li> GREAT GIFT FOR NAIL TECHS</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good that this set has so many colors, now I don&#x27;t have to go out to buy each color whenever I need it. This is very easy to apply, not too thick but I can manage that one. Overall, a nice product.</li>
    <li> Thought there would be at least the basic primary colors. Too many colors close to one another and a lot of browns</li>
    <li> Lots of great colors but they neglected to mention that the brushes are very, very tiny.  Nice packaging, nice gift for a teen.  Good price.</li>
    <li> We got our daughter this along with a case and design brushes for her 13th birthday.  She loves the colors!  Polish seems to adhere well with minimal chipping or flaking.  Every young ladies dream!</li>
    <li> A wonderful product and gift for those who like to do nail art!</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors overall. Very bright and show up on the nail. Easy to use brush. However, I can&#x27;t give 5 stars because 2 of the 20 colors were watery and kind of junky (2 of the sparkly ones). I am not sure if I just received a &amp;#34;lemon&amp;#34; color or if this is the way that these two glittery ones are, but the other colors are excellent!</li>
    <li> I LOVE my new nail polishes. Got here on time and nice packaged. All colors how shown in pictures. I recommend this :) no regrets</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good variety of colors that would work for nail art and these fit the bill perfectly!  There are many shades that I really love, especially all of the bright colored ones!&lt;br /&gt;I received them in perfect condition and love using them!</li>
    <li> Very cute gift for my daughter!  Two leaked but we are fine.</li>
    <li> Great array of colors</li>
    <li> I love the nail polishes but i did get duplicates. I got two #7 and two #18s. I would still say that it is definitley worth it though!</li>
    <li> THIS NAIL ART SET IS BEAUTIFUL!  THE COLORS ARE RICH,BRIGHT AND GREAT FOR ANYONE.  I BROUGHT 2 KITS/SETS ONE FOR ME AND A FRIEND.  AND ITS A GREAT NAIL ART SET FOR STARTING UP UR OWN BUSSINESS ALSO.</li>
    <li> such a nice set, love it and the deal</li>
    <li> this was a gift good value</li>
    <li> WOW....what a collection of colors!  Bought this for my niece for Christmas - she hasn&#x27;t opened it yet but I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll love it now that she has the Nair Art brushes kit and the Nail Art Design book which I sent her for her December birthday.</li>
    <li> large color selection... but smell was a lil bit too much.&lt;br /&gt;but i mean, for this price, it is already really nice.</li>
    <li> This is truly the ART kit.  The brushes are too small to paint nails with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the kit for a 10 yr old slumber party and it did not work well.  It is probably ok, if you know what you are doing, but the girls made a big mess.</li>
    <li> thank you so much for expediting this I LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> This nail polish set is absolutely perfect. It has so many colors! I was incredibly pleased with this item. I saw how a lot of people were complaining about not getting a box. Well I received a box wasn&#x27;t the black one on the picture but a white one that looks the same.   All the colors are perfect. the brushes on the nail polishes are awesome. They paint your nails perfectly and I will most definately be buying another one when this one runs out. I highly recommend it :)</li>
    <li> I would give 5 stars if the yellow colors weren&#x27;t see thru. This nail art set it&#x27;s a great deal. Keep in mind the brushed aren&#x27;t full size because they are for &amp;#34;nail art&amp;#34; use. I was able to do chevron designs in my nails with this set. Use two coats and a top clear coat to keep from chipping. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I was worried about the quality because of the price but these are great! I bought them to go with the larger Shanty polish for my teen. The colors are great! Pleasantly surprised at the quality!</li>
    <li> I got these for my daughters for Christmas.  They LOVE them.  The bottles have quite an ample amount of nail polish, and the little plastic base they come in does a great job at keeping them organized.  The brush is wide enough to use as a general brush to put on the nail polish, but narrow enough to do some nice detail work.  The range of colors is very nice and the possible color combinations are huge.  The polish is really nice quality too.  It flows on smooth, flattens out quickly, and dries very evenly so that you get a beautiful result.  The price is excellent for what you get too.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Good color selection. Came wrapped in plastic with a shaped plastic lid, in display box and then in another box. Brand new and all full. Some of the caps needed a little tightening but there&#x27;s no way they would have leaked anywhere. All the bottles are labeled by number on the bottom and I did get a full set. 24 different colors. So happy with this purchase. Less than a dollar each you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> They are only for design and work good for a short period of time but then start to get chunky and hard to use</li>
    <li> Runny and cheap, and the brushes are too soft to use to embellish which is the whole point of buying these skinny little bottles.  The glass bottles are also cheap and break very easily, we have already broken 4, and have never broken a nail polish bottle before.  Go to Walmart instead, the skinny bottles there have very stiff brushes which make it easy to draw pictures on your nails.</li>
    <li> Im not experienced with nail art but you would never tell&lt;br /&gt;by looking at my nails. The long brush is so managable and easy to use. My nails look professionally done all the time!</li>
    <li> I got these as a gift along with the shany nail plates. I would think that these nail polishes would work with the nail plates and it&#x27;s half true because only some colors work great with the plates such as the black one. The black shany nail polish works beautifully with the shany image plates! so i was very happy with that and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll work with other colors but I haven&#x27;t tried them all yet. All the nail polish were perfect, no strings or dried out ones.. all very good!  An updown was how thin the brush is, we&#x27;re used to kind of thick brushes to paint our nails, these are more of designing such as drawing designs or stuff like that. I paint the whole nail with these though and I don&#x27;t have a problem, also I use them for the image plates and it works just fine :-) I&#x27;m satisfied with this purchase!</li>
    <li> My niece won&#x27;t stop painting and repainting her nails. She loves all the colors. I saw a lot of reviews that some bottles looked like they were already opened or used. Not the case with my order. All bottles were full and sealed.</li>
    <li> This is so much fun to play with! I love painting my nails and this makes it so nice to create designs or different colored tips even! Shipping was fast! My favorite colors are the neon ones, they are so unique! This makes styling nails easier and I know for a fact that everyone will be asking you to do their nails!!! :) Must have every color!!!!</li>
    <li> This product offers an entire spectrum of colors to use.for nail art and are so easy to use. The polish is not too clumpy or anything, and is so easy to apply.  Unlike most sts that only come in packs of  three for like 10$, in the most generic if colors, this set is perfect for anyone who likes to paint there nails with their own flair to the design. Options are limitless and you get way more then what you pay for</li>
    <li> Got this for my granddaughter for Christmas, and she loved it!  It has ever color imaginable and especially liked it because it had so many types of polish, i.e., sparkles, etc.  A great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS NAIL ART KIT!!THEY ARE VERY FAST DRYING, THE POLISHES DO NOT CHIP, AND DID I MENTION THEY ARE BRIGHT AND TRUE TO COLOR!!I like the variety of colors in this nail polish set, and would have given it 5 stars. I have already made a really pretty manicure!  Also, the small brush is great for creating nail art designs! :)</li>
    <li> I love this product. The colors work well. Most of them are pretty thick. The only thing I recommend is if possible keep them in a cooler place so they last longer and do not thicken up. Other then that they are amazing!!</li>
    <li> Colors are beautiful;  However, the polish is too thick and the brush is not thin enough to make quality nail art strokes.  I will try to thin the polish out.</li>
    <li> Cheap product. I knew that. But this didn&#x27;t last past January before clumping set in. Boooo</li>
    <li> This set was better than I expected! The color pigmentation is good! The color applies just as in the pictures. They are not the BEST on the market, the set does have its flaws, but considering each bottle is not even a dollar, this is a steal!!!</li>
    <li> Was sent right out .Lots of fun.</li>
    <li> I had purchased a set for my daughter for Christmas. When I opened it up I realized I should buy a second set for my 11 year old daughter as well. I knew she would LOVE these colors. I can&#x27;t wait until they see the nail sets. Great product.</li>
    <li> I just received this polish today and have just used it. I&#x27;ve been reading other reviews and the biggest complaint is that it didn&#x27;t come with the black box, but mine DID. I saw plenty of reviews saying it didnt, but mine did. This was a nice relief considering I was upset that I might not receive it! The box however is just cardboard, and it was bent and crushed at some of the edges and on the top so this was a huge disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;On another plus note the colors are beautiful! They go on nicely and add a great coat. It only took me a couple coats to make a nice opaque cover. HOWEVER as I have read in other reviews the bottles were not full! Only about half way in each, which makes me SO sad because the bottles are small as it is.&lt;br /&gt;my biggest complaint is that it takes FOREVER TO DRY! I&#x27;m not that impatient but it took me almost an hour to do my nails because the coat just would not dry. All in all I&#x27;m satisfied. I like the small brush for designs (though some sizes tend to be varied) I love the colors as I have said, and I had no breaks or leaks. I also think it was a pretty good deal for 25 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to say thank you to amazon. The shipment came the day they said it would. Nothing was broken, and though the product isn&#x27;t perfect i don&#x27;t blame them one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shany products are scams in general, but this one isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
    <li> My daughter is happy with these</li>
    <li> Nail salon accessories.</li>
    <li> I love each and every color! Now I can change my toenails color every week! Love these nail polishes for real! I&#x27;m definitely recommending it!</li>
    <li> Received this set quickly and was very pleased with the quality.  Lots of colors and several glitters.  Like the thin striper brush, easy to do nail art stripes.</li>
    <li> I love all the colors that are offered. It&#x27;s nice to have verity of not just color, but shades, there isn&#x27;t just a blue, but a dark and light version! Great buy for the cost!</li>
    <li> Though I haven&#x27;t tried these products out, I will.  These products look great, and are reasonably priced, and offer the same colors that you would get in a salon for your nails (finger, and toe) for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors. Nice fast drying nail polish.</li>
    <li> Colors are pretty brush is tiny really tiny.  Nail art only not good for painting nails</li>
    <li> SO many colors! Bought this set for my niece and she loved it. It isn&#x27;t top of the line nail polish, but it&#x27;s great for kids that are learning how to make designs on their own nails.</li>
    <li> My 22 yr old granddaughter is very artistic and creative. She loves using these for original designs for her nails and the nails of her friends. It brings out the artist in her ! A fun kit that is reasonably priced !</li>
    <li> When i ordered this set it was mainly becuase of nail polishes # 2,6 and 18. I recieved two bottles of 17, which is a light pink which i hate, and i did not recieve 18 at all, because of this i am done ordeing nail polish from shanny, its an irritating thing to not recieve what you ordered, i know its a small mistake but it still could have been avoided if some one would have done there job correctly,</li>
    <li> Firstly, I love the vibrancy of these colors. I&#x27;m a very bold and bright person, so naturally I want what I&#x27;m wearing to reflect that. I love, love, LOVE these colors. It has good texture, it&#x27;s not too runny or too thick. I hate when I try to paint my nails and one drop turns my hand a new color. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with these, at least not ones due to the polish. I am very clumsy after all!</li>
    <li> The polish collection arrived on time and was as described.  To be honest some of the colors were just a little bright for me.  I am a middle aged woman and mother and most of these colors were more for the teen to late 20 crowd.  The polishes did go on smoothly and dried quickly.  They last quite well.  There were a few that I felt comfortable wearing and they lasted longer than my usual polish.  So, I will want to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;  OK I HAVE CHANGED MY MIND, thanks to being thought how to use these colors.  My daughter took me to a friend of hers that does nails who showed me how to use these colors properly to get very nice effects.  I now love these colors, and will definately be ordering more.  My Daughter also found me a couple how to magazines for other ideas.  I guess a slightly older woman can learn new things.These colors are not just for the teen to late 20 crowd.  LindaW</li>
    <li> I could not believe I got so many Nail polish for the price. all color are good and I use them. I recommend it to every one.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my 11-year old niece because she&#x27;s very into nail design. She absolutely loves all the colors and that it came with it&#x27;s own tray for storage. She also loves that it has glitter colors as well. I highly recommend this product. You get a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this set 2 dys. ago and received them today,they were wrapped properly and had absolutely no leakage.It came in the black box and also in the plastic tray,the only downside was that color 6 was about half full and very thick,I thought that it was probably too cold and had it turned upside down for a few hrs.but it remained in the same position.Also the brushes are very thin and one would have a very hard time painting a nail.I think its ideal for designs only,but the colors are absolutely gorgeous,so bright and pretty,would recommend to anyone..</li>
    <li> I like the colors but the smell was too overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use this but make sure to vent well.&lt;br /&gt;it came in a box as shown which I liked.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes looked fine too unlike the cheap ones out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very excited to start using these colors! The colors are true to the description and so bright! I&#x27;m looking forward to creating my own designs on my nails:)No more salon trips for me! Thank you for shipping quickly.</li>
    <li> This is a set of basically every color you will need to create pretty DIY nail art. You can use these with nail plates or simply draw on your nails. For the price, I think this product is a great value.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try and I absolutely LOVE it! I came in the black package as shown inside another box. The colors are sealed well. I received one of every color and none were spilled, opened, or exploded. I definitely recommend buying this product. Lots of great quality for one low price. Well worth the buy!</li>
    <li> These were just as described. Came in the box!! Love it and will keep them in the box. Love all the colors. I would definitely recommend buying these. They come out to like $1.04 each!! Can&#x27;t beat that!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the polish yet, but 2 of the bottles were open and 1 was a fourth empty.  It wasn&#x27;t too bad.  The polish was just a little thicker.</li>
    <li> Got this for my sister in law for xmas and we got 6 same colors on the blue #19. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with how fast it got here took only 4 days including the weekend. I opened it and was pleased to see how they were packed. None were broken and I had no duplicates. Only disappoinment was when I went to write this review I saw it was 5 dollars cheaper than what I had paid but its still a great product and I would order from shany again.</li>
    <li> It is fair because smell too strong.</li>
    <li> a great variety of colors and glitter. i got this set to use with stamping plates and you would think that since it says right on the display stand \\&quot;use with stamping plates\\&quot; that would be the case, however alot of them are very thin and require a few coats. only the darkest colors work with the plates. but thats ok because the lighter colors make good base colors. overall i&#x27;m very satisfied with the set the shipping was fast and they came packaged very well. i&#x27;ll probably order them again when i run out.</li>
    <li> A lot of different colors but about a quarter of them were matted and dry or half empty. I think I got a bad batch.</li>
    <li> The colors are nice and vibrant.This is a gift for someone who I am sure she will love . I loved it so much I ordered another one for my friends daughter .</li>
    <li> One of the polishes opened during shipping. A bit messy but the rest were ok</li>
    <li> Pretty good but accidentally got a duplicate of gold instead of a silver</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my niece and she loved it!  Lots of choices and high quality.  Shipping was fast and packaged well.</li>
    <li> I love this nail art set.  Mine came in the black box from the picture, inside they were all in this little tray thing.  There were no duplicates, and none were open or spilled.  I love the colors, nice and bright.  It didn&#x27;t take a long time to dry, about the average time.  It&#x27;ll take me a long time before I use them all up, but when I do I&#x27;ll be ordering another one, can&#x27;t beat the price for so many bottles.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s impossible to argue with the price here....you get every color under the rainbow at a steal of a price.  The colors are vibrant and you&#x27;ll make a teenage girl scream in glee if you buy this for her.</li>
    <li> I was a little bit concerned when I read quite a few reviews stating they got the duplicate colors in the box. I went ahead and took a chance! The package was delivered very fast!!!! I absolutely love the colors!!! all are different. Brushes are not that great but hopefully if you are buying this set, you have a full set of brushes anyways. The variety of colors is so wide and they are very beautiful! I am happy!.My daughter is too! Also, they dry up fast!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipment, got the item and perfect for getting into nail art</li>
    <li> If your like me you change up your nail polish color and design on a weekly basis or even on a daily basis at times. Nail art and nail colors are always so much fun for me and also you always have so many options to chose from. this set comes with 24 colors that you can wear for any ocassion. Sping is here and those pinks ans blues seem nice for this time of year.</li>
    <li> If you do any type of Nail art at all this set is a must have. It has every color needed to create brilliant nails for every occasion. I love that it goes on smoothly and the brushes I can paint just about anything. I&#x27;m not an Artist but this nail Art set says fill your World with Color.!</li>
    <li> I have to say I absolutely love this nail set. If you are someone like me who likes to change up their nails all the time then this is for you. It has every color you could want all in one set. The nail art set is a must have if you want to get the most detail out of your nail designs because the brush is so thin that you can really make your designs pop. I like how fast it drys, usually I have to sit and wait, I always seem to mess my nails up somehow. What I really like is how many colors comes in this set I dont have to keep buying the color I want which adds up I have them all in one with this set.</li>
    <li> great colors, good for nail art! ordered 2 times!</li>
    <li> I am dying to get these! I&#x27;ve recently started doing my own designs on my nails because at the nail place they charge me over $15 to do designs. I have been looking for a set like this of nail art polish and I haven&#x27;t been able to locate any. So glad I finally found one!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so much fun being able to make all the adorable designs that you can get at the nail salon in your own home! All the colors are so adorable and as advertised! Very good quality materials! I am impressed and I will be buying from Shany Cosmetics again! :)</li>
    <li> This is the PERFECT PERFECT PERFEECT set to have beautiful nail art and I myself have no need to buy any individual nail art polish because I have all the colors and it&#x27;s the best investment!</li>
    <li> Luv the colors!!! One for each mood and will not damamge your nails!!! I change them as often as I want!!!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my daughter and she loved it! They work extremely well and have very vibrant colors. This is a wonderful product and I would recommend this for anyone who loves to do their nails.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this in the mail.  When I opened the box I smelt very strong nail polish odor.  Most of the nail polish bottles were leaking because of the heat.  I had to wash them all off the bottles.  Then when I finally go to use the strippers they were very clumpy and taky.  I think the heat from shipping it ruined the quality of the paint.  I suggest putting a cool pack in with your polishes so this does not happen again.  It says on the bottles keep out of heat.  Luckily none of the bottles exploded on me while opening the package.  I am unsure if I will order from this company again.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors packaged nicely</li>
    <li> good colors, good polish</li>
    <li> Unbelievable. It is a perfect art set. the colors are bright and so beautiful. I will use all 24 colors. very good quality materials. Unbelievable.</li>
    <li> wife loves them, and uses them constantly. the nail polish holds up nicely.</li>
    <li> Kpop! This was the first thing that came into my mind when I purchased this item! Now, I can do my nails just like my idols and I can experiment with it. Because it has so many colors in the first place, I cannot even choose what to use but so far my combination works and I find the brushes very easy to use. Now, I change my nails once  a week, I cannot wait for my next color/ colors!</li>
    <li> Not the best quality, you get what you pay for. Fast shipping though.</li>
    <li> purchased as a gift for someone so i didn&#x27;t open it but it was packaged great and looks very nice.</li>
    <li> came on time. just as pictured, great quality! love them.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the 1-2 star reviews, I was a bit nervous to see what I had purchased once I received it.  To my delight, I received 24 beautiful colors!  Not only was the product exactly what I had expected, the shipping was super fast!!!  I purchased this item on 7/8/13 and received it on 7/11/13!! I will definitely be purchasing from this company again!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Need 5 coats to be able to see the color</li>
    <li> While the color selection is outstanding, I feel that the brush is way too long. The length of the brush makes it hard to control the designs because it&#x27;s far too flimsy. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my lack of &amp;#34;artistry&amp;#34; or lack of experience/practice since I just recently got with the trend of nail design, but I will probably have to cut each brush down in order to use it properly.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:1db4ba8dc15b78928180d0c6385b9236]] Keep in mind this is a nail art set, not a set of 24 nail polish bottles designed for painting your whole nail. This means that the tips of the brushes are small and fine, made so you can add tiny details to your already painted nails. It&#x27;s like working with the tip of a pencil, not a large wide brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this set there are 24 different colors or all shards, including several glitter paints. The paint is thick and bold in color. Not thin or watery. These go great with the [[ASIN:B009CA7T4O Shany  Nailmaster 37 Piece Nail Brush Set with Carry On Case]]. I have both sets and between the brushes that have just about every shape and size you could need, and all the colors of paints in this set, one can create about anything. Each bottle of polish is filled to the top and the caps screw on and off easily, without the brush coming detached. It&#x27;s a great set with a ton of colors for making all kinds of designs on your nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> I received all 24 (different colors) in perfect condition. All of the brushes were in great shape, unlike some that I have purchased at upwards of $3 a bottle. They were packaged very nicely, and arrived right on schedule. Super excited to put them to good use. Overall great price for a great product!</li>
    <li> Bought for my gf and she loves it no complaints</li>
    <li> The colors are amazing. The packaging is very wrapped which was annoying but subtle since it&#x27;s glass. Bubble wraps and boxes and plastic boxes! Easy with scissors 😌😌</li>
    <li> This product is a great deal. The colors are beautiful! They have a fine brush which is great for decorating and making little designs (you can also paint the whole nail too). I have a 3 year old and she loves for me to paint her nails with all 24 bright , amazing colors! The fingernail polish hasn&#x27;t chipped any since I&#x27;ve painted my nails (which was 2 days ago). The only dislike I have is that the nail polish doesnt have the best smell, but you won&#x27;t pay any attention to that once you see the amazing colors on your nails. I recommend this product! \\&quot;THUMBS UP\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have been very happy with this purchase. You get a lot of colors and a holder for a great price! It&#x27;s a worth it purchase if you are unsure.</li>
    <li> I ordered this prduct about a month ago, but was very dissapointed due to many factors such as bottles not being completly filled also the white polish was very thick and sticky, and some bottles had polish on the side of them. what also upseted me was the prdouct is not even sealed in the black box shown. If it had been dilivered with the product in side the box I might not feel that some one decided to paint their nails with the polishes I ordered before they delivered it to me. On the positive side I was very happy with the colors.</li>
    <li> This is a great amount of polish at a very reasonable price.  Take note that the brushes are thinner for artwork but I have had no problem painting my nails or my daughters nails with these.  The one drawback is that many of the colors are too light to show up for stamping.  But I have used those as a base coat.  Also some work better if you use a really dark base coat.  You have to play around with them to figure out which colors work best, but for the price this is a great set.  My daughter loves the amount of colors to choose from, and she is only 6.  She now wants to polish her nails more often.  I have also used these to stamp her nails and it worked great.  Over all this is a great set, it only lost one star due to not all of them being perfect for stamping, but I don&#x27;t think that was the initial intent of this set either.</li>
    <li> my daughter and I both use this.  We love it.  Color variety is great.  And the colors are bright and vibrant. We love playing around with it.</li>
    <li> Daughter was so excited!! I love all these colors...having lots of fun with these!!</li>
    <li> My grandaughters love all the colors!  Some shiny, some really bright colors.  Brushes are skinny, great for creating nail art.  Polish has a good staying power and has not chipped.</li>
    <li> I just received this item and the colors are absolutely awesome. Better and more beautiful in person than in the picture. I would recommend, its awesome.</li>
    <li> I found it hard to do designs with this ser because the nail polish dries too fast on the nail and on the brush. Definitly will not buy again</li>
    <li> 24 nail polishes for a little over a dollar a piece? Yes, please! Plus there are colors for all seasons, and brights just right for the spring trend of neons, and basic colors! Awesome deal!</li>
    <li> The colors are so bold, vibrant, and beautiful. You have so many choices to design your nails with your unique style and flair. Go ahead and[[ASIN:B005X2F7KI Shany Nail Art Set (24 Famouse Colors Nail Art Polish, Nail Art Decoration)]] treat yourself and Add some Color and Pizzazz to your Spring wardrobe. Go crazy and have fun let the artist within come out and play!</li>
    <li> The nail art polishes are great for the do it yourself nail junkie.  I always do my own nails and have recently gotten into doing nail designs.  These polishes are great because you get so many colors to choose from.  The brush is fine tipped which helps with getting a more precise line.  These polishes would be fun to try out with nail stamping.</li>
    <li> Usually I like pretty low key nails but the great thing about these is I can add something extra without it being over the top.  This compliments any nail color I have on and is a great deal!</li>
    <li> Wonderful colors and packaged nicely too.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS NAIL ART KIT!! SOOO MANY BRIGHT AND NEON COLORS! THE COLOR YOU SEE IN THE BOTTLES ARE TRUE TO COLOR...VERY BEAUTIFUL!!! I CAN NOT WAIT TO MORE ARE IN STOCK BECAUSE I WOULD MOST DEFINITELY PURCHASE A BACK UP!! THEY ARE VERY FAST DRYING, THE POLISHES DO NOT CHIP, AND DID I MENTION THEY ARE BRIGHT AND TRUE TO COLOR!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! 5 STARS SHANY COSMETICS!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a christmas gift so im waiting to see if they actually were worth the buy.. They look fresh but you wont know until you actually try them. I didn&#x27;t like how they came packaged i thought i would get the black box pictured- I dont really need it but when giving a gift it would have made it look much nicer.</li>
    <li> I bought these to go with the nail stamping system.  The colors are great.  They work well with the image plates and stamp.  The brush in the bottle is thin for painting thin stripes or designs.  Shipping was fast and all colors were as pictured with no duplicates or unusable colors.</li>
    <li> My niece loved all of the colors.</li>
    <li> some of the polish is thick and needs thinner</li>
    <li> The colors are amazing and you won&#x27;t be missing out on any color cause it&#x27;s all there! The long thin brushes are easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;stink-up\\&quot; the place after you use it. I will definitely be using this to add fun colors and designs to my mani&#x27;s/pedi&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Would have said 5 stars I&#x27;d the brushes were more even, they have stray bristles that will mess up precise nail art. I use my own brushes with them now. I also use these for stamping but some colors are too sheer (red appears pink and such) still great for the price love the glitters especially&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get any double colors like some people said they did</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift as an avid nail designer. Buying each of these colors in good quality usually costs between $45-100. I love the shades, the variety, and the rich vibrancy of the colors. Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ll I give it a 2 star rating because I have waited now a week and it&#x27;s still not here:( :(</li>
    <li> great product. fast delivery. very good packaging.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> So many colors! So many choices! So little time! Now I can paint on my nails to look good and not with just 3 or 4 colors but 24. And the price is great too! The brush is fine and thin which gives you very precise nail art. The nail polish is good quality. It&#x27;s currently out of stock so I&#x27;ll get more for gifts when it comes back.</li>
    <li> I just got this for my birthday today. When I opened it I couldn&#x27;t believe that there were so many colors! I&#x27;m totally gonna have to paint my nails this summer!! &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I love nail art and these gorgeous and vibrant colors are so easy to work with and make it soooo incredibly easy to let your creativity flow while you create a unique piece of art on your nails.</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loves doing her own nails. The price for so many colors is a bargain! Her creativity will not be hindered by the amazing colors and how much there is of these nail polish!</li>
    <li> The colors of the nail polish are all very pretty, and I&#x27;m really happy that it came with white and black. You also get some glitter ones too. The brush is the small striper size brush for lines and such in nail art. The nail polish didn&#x27;t come in the black box, but like someone else said it does come shrink wrapped and in it&#x27;s shany holder that is pictured next to the black box.. so it still looks nice. The only thing that bothered me was that some of my polishes has apparently leaked out at one time and dried on the side of them.. that&#x27;s probably because of the warehouse though.. so it&#x27;s not really their fault since it&#x27;s stored with amazon. Overall I&#x27;m happy to start using these for nail art :D gonna save tons of money.. and next I&#x27;m gonna get some nail polish pens lol.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping. Product came as described.</li>
    <li> A great assortment of colors for budding nail artists or just teens who like to do their nails a lot!</li>
    <li> Well overall these are great. Love them actually. However we did receive a duplicate of one color and with this type of product there is no returning it. So we are stuck with two of the same color and missing one. Overall not bad. Still wish we could have gotten the missing color but hey awesome price for 24 and our Nails and Toes look AMAZING....</li>
    <li> We bought these nail polishes to go with the mash nail plates and I LOVE them! They are true to their color! They work great for the mash nail plates! They are a thin brush for painting designs! I love the plastic tray they come in very sturdy and great for holding them all so they don&#x27;t roll away when I am using them! If you love bright colors than I suggest these for you! They are great and very bright and beautiful!</li>
    <li> Still like  to use my own artist brushes to paint designs because the brush sizes are too small. Otherwise good choice colors.</li>
    <li> Arrived in tact, no spillages/good presentation.  Pleased with the wide variety of colours, Excellent value for money. Would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> My daughter is very happy, it was very good choice. She is 17th so she knows what she needs and how it is working. Came fast. Very good shopping! Thank you!</li>
    <li> The colors are great for anyone wanting to do there nails</li>
    <li> I love the brushes! They&#x27;re fine enough so that I can carefully complete my art pieces! I love the wide range of colors in the set as well!</li>
    <li> Excellent services and high quality</li>
    <li> I bought these for a girls summer camp. They are exactly as described. They have thin brushes so you can draw hearts, polka dots or whatever. The girls had a blast with these. They were good quality and fun colors.</li>
    <li> I think that this would have been SUCH a great set, if only the brushes had been completely different.  It&#x27;s a great idea if you are getting them for maybe a younger child, but if not, they might not be what you are looking for, I ended up giving mine away.  Shame, because I loved the colors.  The brushes are VERY thin and straight down - so by the time you have painted your whole nail it looks pretty tacky and the lines are clearly visible. Other than the brushes, great product.</li>
    <li> I do nails on the regular for friends, I used to buy LA Colors product that was similar and was paying like 5 bucks a pop. This quantity and quality are unbelieveable! Thanks Shany!</li>
    <li> im a begginer designer but the set and colors are awsome! ill def put it to good use, best xmas gift ever</li>
    <li> The box is nicely packed and the selection of colors are beautiful.  This product exceeded what I expected to receive for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have had this for over a year now, and my daughter has had a great time with it, so many different colors to choose from, and we haven&#x27;t had a problem with any of them, or the brushes.  The brushes are very thin, for nail art purposes.  I just use a little bigger one if we are painting solid colors.  The glittery colors seem the most \\&quot;globby\\&quot;, just takes a little more patience to apply, but overall, really great for the price!</li>
    <li> Great price!  But you get what you pay for.  Very, very watery.  You cannot paint a design on your nails because its like water, and it will take about 3-4 coats to paint regularly and then you have streaks.  Overall, a waste of money. Buy yourself a cup of good coffee instead.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use some of the fun colors that came in this nail polish kit.  It has so many bright, spring and summer colors.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product, as it&#x27;s always hard for me to decide what colors I like in the store.</li>
    <li> I love all the colors and the sparkle colors too. The brush in the handle is very fine for art work.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my teenage daughter and she loved it. Has already opened it and redone her nails several times.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter absolutely loved this as a Christmas present.  I included in the package a fingernail care kit.</li>
    <li> The brushes were not very uniformed; the shape/length/thickness of the brush was different for each bottle. There were few colors that didn&#x27;t show when applied.</li>
    <li> Wow, this is the best deal I&#x27;ve seen on nail polish in a long time. You get so many vibrant beautiful colors to choose from. These are nail art brushes for fine detail. I love that you can get a whole kit for this price!</li>
    <li> This nail art set is great for individuals who are into making free hand nail art. Many vibrant colors which is a plus since I would never find any of these beautiful colors. The brush is slim, perfect for creating lines and the fine tip makes great dots. I&#x27;m very content with this purchase and happy it&#x27;s a part of my nail art collection.</li>
    <li> unbelievable. it even comes in a set of three. if you love looking nice than you will love these polishes. i cant live without them.</li>
    <li> love the way it all comes in its spot in a very nice package, it all stays put in its place. all the colors come numbered. really nice colors. completely satisfied</li>
    <li> The colors are true to the colors you see. The amount you get for this price is crazy.  I can imagine these will last awhile.  can&#x27;t wait to try them!</li>
    <li> I purchased three sets of these for our three daughters at Christmas, which now was 6 mo ago.  Their ages at that time were 19, 18 and 16... they, all three, LOVE them still!! They use them constantly; which makes me very happy. Not money wasted!!</li>
    <li> for my niece and it took sometime to be delivered but I understand why,this is worth it.</li>
    <li> I love all of the colors!</li>
    <li> I got this set as a birthday gift and unfortunately when I did my nails for the week the polish came off in pieces within a matter of days. Literally 2 days after I did them almost all of the polish was missing from my nails and I haven&#x27;t used it since. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Go to walmart and get cheap polish if you want something that will last longer because this brand just isn&#x27;t it. I&#x27;ve tried everything from china glaze to opi and then some but none of them ever chipped as badly as this. Stay away.</li>
    <li> This is a great product but when i got it it had one nail polish that was broken, i would return it but its only one and i dont know how, but if you like doing nail art, then get these.</li>
    <li> I am just beginning in learning to do Nail Art Designs and purchased this set for that purpose.  I have seen other reviews on this were some have complained about the brushes in the bottles...Before you purchase this make sure you understand that this is for NAIL ART which means the actual brush it&#x27;s self will be long and slender for the purpose of putting designs on your nails. You can always use another Nail brush for these but be sure you clean your nail brushes before putting them in the new nail polish and always read the product information and reviews before you purchase something so your not surprised by something when you get it.  The color&#x27;s in this set are Gorgeous!!! they go on beautifully!!! absolutely perfect for the beginning Nail Art designer to the Professional Nail Art Designer!!! GREAT PRODUCT!!! GREAT PRICE!!!</li>
    <li> Much more than i expected it would be ,,great for those who love to make designs on nails ,its a must have for all nail art lovers</li>
    <li> Great colors, good quality, arrived on time</li>
    <li> This nail polish set is incredible! Every color is exactly what you see in the jar, which means about half of them are glittery and semi-translucent, and the other half go on opaque. The brush is long and thin, so you can do very precise work. I was able to paint rainbow stripes on a pink nail and got 7 stripes from left to right - these brushes are amazing! A couple of the bristles were too long - of the 25 bottles, 2 bottles each had one bristle slightly too long, and I just used nail clippers to trim it to match the length of the other bristles. You don&#x27;t need to put much on, either. A very thin coat goes on completely opaque. At less than a dollar per bottle, this is an amazing deal. I usually don&#x27;t rant about nail polish (this was for my daughter&#x27;s spa party, I don&#x27;t do my own nails), but this product was really impressive.</li>
    <li> My friend has a birthday party. I think it is a very nice gift for her! She likes nail art.</li>
    <li> i have never written a BAD product review before, but with  this stuff, I felt obligated to warn all women out there. this is the most awful terrible bad nail polish I have ever used. often I buy my nail polish at the dollar store due to money being so tight. often I will get ones that go on lumpy or uneven. for this product, that would be a step up. ill start with the applicator/ brush. it is literally the width of a toothpick. so you better have an hour for each nail. then, when trying to apply the stuff to your nail, you can see each individual stroke. Plus it turns gooey like melting rubber. tried putting it on sideways also... just to have a wider stroke. I wish I had the ability to truly describe how AWEFUL this stuff is. THEN when I clicked on return, NO RETURNS ALLOWED. so I called amazon and explained the situation, thankfully they gave me a full credit as this stuff is completely un usable. ill take that 20 bux and go to the dollar store and get much more outta that!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it three stars because it come with a lot of colors and the brush is very fine. It is perfect for small details. The polish itself is kind of crappy. It is thick and sticky. I even used a variety of my good brushes and it still just clumps on and doesn&#x27;t spread evenly. My Dollar store Wet and Wild polish is better.. lol</li>
    <li> I am in love!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it is fantastic, each color is different from the rest, and they are beautiful. And i adore the little stand it comes with for them to sit in!! Over all it was money happily spent!!! I would definitely buy this item again.</li>
    <li> For the price this is a pretty good deal! Some of the colors may be a little too light but I haven&#x27;t had too much issues with the rest! These are good for tips and giving those designs a little color!</li>
    <li> I wanted to return it but was not allowed. The bristle would hang off the main stem . I could not use it!</li>
    <li> I liked the variety of colors, but these brush sizes are for nail art and not plain painting your nails. The smell was also strong and the and the polish was very thick. The brush was uneven and had to make them even.</li>
    <li> I do my own nails so I purchased this nail set to do my own nail art. I loved the fact that it came in a little display tray so that it will keep them neat and together which is perfect for storing! Lots of great colors and the brush is thin enough to do great designs with. I will definitely purchase them again!</li>
    <li> My baby was happy with this, lots of colors and also arrived super fast. Good purchase!</li>
    <li> Bad quality , so disappointed</li>
    <li> This are so cool, every single one paints like the color on the bottle, the only bad thing I notice was the smell, it&#x27;s very strong and different from all the nail polish I have</li>
    <li> I just received my Shany Nail Art Set (24 colors) and its fantastic! I am so impressed by some of the colors (like dark gray or marine(ish) blues) because they aren&#x27;t all your &amp;#34;typical&amp;#34; common colors. I can&#x27;t wait to dig into this set and get some nails painted!</li>
    <li> I ordered it because I have my husbands cousins come to stay with us from time to time and when ever they come we have to go out and find some polishes for them do have a girls night with me. Well after we received these in the mail we wont need to do that any more, we absolutely love the colors and everything. The only downside is the little brushes but that can be fixed by buying their brush kits from SHANY too, now we are just waiting for the brush kits in the mail!</li>
    <li> So glad I got these! You can have hours of fun creating all kinds of fun designs. The polish is of very good quality too, and doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
    <li> it came really fast (it only took 2 days-because i also signed up for the prime membership). But anyways the products pretty worth it, I only have one bad thing to say about it and that is that the quality of the nail polish is not a good, but then again the brand is not a high end one either. i say this because when you paint it on over a base color, the color doesn&#x27;t come out as a solid color its kinda transparent. But I am satisfied with it overalls and now that i have a lot more colors to play with, i can do my own nails and such and especially since my prom is just literally within a month i can get ready or prom nails as well.</li>
    <li> Colors last pretty well for being a cheap set. There&#x27;s a few colors I wish it had, like a few more shades of green instead of all the pinks/reds. Thin brushes in these make designing a lot easier though.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize there was 24 colors and that is pretty awesome, the packaging is some of the best I&#x27;ve seen for nail supplies my 3 stars is due to the fact that a lot of the colors are runny and tend to &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34; my nail, I&#x27;ve had to have my nail Specialist buff it off a few times!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, great fashion colors. My wife&#x27;m amazed with the purchase. The brush is perfect for artistic drawings. Wonderfull colors</li>
    <li> Reviews hare seemed a bit spotty regarding quality upon receipt so I was skeptical. No issues with mine. They arrived in perfect condition. I am not a typical user either. I bought these to use in my workshop, as marking tools. Nice colors to help distinguish the markings. Problem is that when they arrived, my wife took them! She loved the variety and told me I could borrow them if I needed them in my workshop.</li>
    <li> This set of nail polishes looks amazing. Colors are very brilliant. Brushes are with very fine tips for nail arts. But, the quality of the polish is awful. Colors take forever to dry! Some brushes out of the set are weird, too thin, looks like they are damaged. 2 bottles out of the set were leaking the color out when I received it. Some bottles simply seem used or just half-filled. I gave it 3 stars because the colors look good. For painting my full nails I can use other brushes, but I hate to wait at least 5-10 minutes to let 1 coat dry!</li>
    <li> Great colors! Thank you</li>
    <li> Usually, I like pretty low key nails but the great thing about these is I can add something extra without being over the top. This compliments any nail color I have on.</li>
    <li> Estimated delivery was July 23-28 and it came on July 23 (5 days after ordering). None were broken and none had repeat colors.  Only one had a brush that was messed up, but just snipped the fly always and it was good.  Still a little thick but the color is great ! I would recommend this product to anyone, especially for the price</li>
    <li> Was very happy with this product, the case it came in and the quality</li>
    <li> These work great for putting designs on your nails like they do at salons, beautiful colors and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Very good quality nail art paint!</li>
    <li> I love my set of nail art colors. These work great. I either use the brush they come with in the bottle or they are thin/thick enough to use my own nail art tools. Good selection of colors and I use most of them.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves these colors</li>
    <li> I love my new nail polish! The colors are great and the polish is really good quality. My only complaint is some of the brushes have stay hairs that stick out but it&#x27;s nothing a nail clipper can&#x27;t fix. Also, the packaging is perfect to store display or give as a gift!</li>
    <li> i got some duplicated color. And the smell is extra stinky than average nail polish. Considered to the price and quality, it&#x27;s still a good deal.</li>
    <li> I love the range of colors you get here and they are priced really well.  I can&#x27;t find colors like these at my local beauty stores and am so excited to try these out. It&#x27;s great because my fiancé is an artist and loves to draw these beautiful designs on my nails. These will be great for both him and me. I absolutely love the brush. It&#x27;s perfect for intricate little designs and also all over nail pictures.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great buy! The colors are very bright, beautiful, and I love that it includes most shades. I have used them and found the nail brush to be perfect for making designs. The product came exactly as it is portrayed, in the black Shany box. I was not missing any colors nor did I have half empty bottles. This product is well worth the buy!</li>
    <li> I love this set. It provides a variety of brightly colored nail polishes in different \\&quot;textures\\&quot; like matte, glitter, pearlized, etc... so you can get different looks for every day or special occasions.</li>
    <li> I bought this art set for my daughter and she just loves it.  The colors are awesome and it gives her endless possibilities for&lt;br /&gt;creating fun and beautiful nail designs!</li>
    <li> I ORDERED THESE BECAUSE I WANTED TO USE THEM FOR MY NAIL ART.  THE BRUSHES ARE VERY THIN AND IT MAKES IT EASY TO USE WHEN MAKING NAIL DESIGN.  THE COLORS ARE GORGEOUS AND BRIGHT.  I CAN MAKE THE RAINBOW VERY EASY ONE MY NAILS FOR WHEN I WANT TO STAMP ON A DESIGN.  I GIVE THIS PRODUCT A 5 STAR RATING.  TRY THEM YOU WILL BE VERY HAPPY.</li>
    <li> SHANY NAIL ART SET&lt;br /&gt;THESE NAIL ART COLORS ARE PRETTY AND QUITE DURABLE, WITH TOP COAT. THEIR ONY FAULT IS THE QUALITY OF THE BRUSHES. THE BRISTLES SEEM TO BE SLIGHTLY LOOSE OR UNEVEN, LEAVING &amp;#34;stringers&amp;#34; that interfere with detail painting. They work better with other BRUSHES.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter, but I like them so much that I will be using them as well. The colors are lovely, and they stay true even after shower/bath. I have had them on for 3 days, and even after cooking cleaning typing mowing, they have not chipped.&lt;br /&gt;So yep! happy!</li>
    <li> There are so many cool colors. This is perfect for anyone who likes to change their polish often. And with so many choices its easy to make flowers and other designs.</li>
    <li> A must have. Easy to use. Vibrant, vivid, eye-popping colors. Brings a lot of fun to nail art. Will buy more to make exceptional gifts for all ages.</li>
    <li> I got these today and immediately was excited!. They where all different colors glitter included. I tried a few out and they are great for what I&#x27;m looking for to do designs. The only thing is the brush is a bit thick but the polish is great. Definitely would order from them again with different colors. I also had no duplicates or broke. Bottles. It was packaged nicely and even came with a box to store them in.</li>
    <li> I ordered these striping paints on May 8th.They came today,May 12th.The packing was very good ,a box within a box ,within a box.All 24 bottles were clean ,no dried paint on any bottles.No broken bottles at all. Only one bottle was a little tough to open. I  gave it to my son ,he opened it No problem. That one bottle was a glitter paint ,there was a little paint built up around the neck of the bottle .It was very full ,so I used some .I did not received any double paints like some reviews  mentioned.There are two reds ,they do look the same in the bottles,but on paper or a nail you are able to see a difference.I received 5 bottles that are the glitter paints.One an emerald green,one gold,one silver,one is a deep grape wine color ,and one is a beautiful cobalt,navy blue.I got 4 different shades of pink ,very different shades of pink.3 very different shades of yellow.A deep pearl navy blue ,a bright white,an orange that to me is a few shades deeper then a very ripe melon.a beautiful sky blue.And I think maybe my favorite,a periwinkle,soft lavender shade.There is also your basic black, a pearl deep purple,a pearl lime green,plus a very dark hunter green,and a dark charcoal grey.They came standing in a plastic tray so each does fit snugly in the tray without falling over.The tray isn&#x27;t heavy duty ,but it serves the purpose well.I held the tray sideways with the paint bottles and they did not fall out ,not one.I opened each bottle and ran a stripe along a sheet of white paper and an artificial nail and the paints are a nice consistency,not really thick but flows well for any striping needs.The  5 glitter paints are more transparent in color to show the glitter ,but they are not clear,just sheer clean color to complement the matching glitter.The paints did not dry flat.There is a little shine to the colors .And drum roll,very little if any odor,which is important to me because I paint my granddaughters&#x27; nails often.I&#x27;m really sorry for those who were unhappy with this product ,I myself am a very happy customer.The colors are bright and very pretty .These paints that I received definitely deserve the 5***** I gave them.Thank you for reading .  SMILES.uct ,I myself am a very happy customer.The colors are bright and very pretty .These paints that I received definitely deserve the 5***** I gave them.Thank you for reading .  SMILES.</li>
    <li> These are great for decorating your nail. The brush is a liner brush so they are best for decorating only.</li>
    <li> super fast shipping and the brush was amazingly thin which is perfect for nail art to perfection</li>
    <li> Arrived intact with a wide variety of colors. Nail polish doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry, and has a lovely shiny finish.</li>
    <li> most of the colors worked perfectly except for the baby pink and blue but other than that I loved them</li>
    <li> My Sister loves it,I bought these for her Birthday</li>
    <li> This was a great Christmas gift for my 13 year old daughter. She loves to do all kinds of designs on her nails and it was great to find a bundle of different colored quality nail polish. I would comment on how long the polish stays on, but she keeps removing it and doing different designs and colors every other day:) !</li>
    <li> I received these as a gift for Christmas, and I absolutely love them. The colors are all beautiful, and they have very decent opacity. You get a ton of polish for the price. 24 polishes for the price is amazing. Even if you get a duplicate it would still be a great deal!&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of people who complained about the bottles being broken, half full, or having many duplicate colors, but we were lucky enough to get an excellent set! There are two bottles of red polish, that look identical, but the numbers on the bottom of the bottles are different. So, I guess the colors are just very close.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are excellent, very thin and I am able to use them quite precisely. There is one brush (in the silver glitter) that is totally fraying, and there are bristles sticking out everywhere, and there are a couple of brushes that have one extra long bristle at the end that is a little bit annoying when trying to make a nice even line. The polish goes on very smoothly though, and it&#x27;s very easy to apply to the nail.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say anything about the staying power of this polish, because I don&#x27;t use it as a regular nail polish. I use it for the purpose of nail art. Also, it dries very quickly. I would assume if you glob it on there it&#x27;s not going to dry quickly, but it dried quite quickly for me. They do not smudge when you apply a topcoat over them (as long as you wait until the polish if fully dry first).&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product four stars, because of the two red polishes that are almost identical, and the one brush that&#x27;s frayed. Also, a couple of the silver caps screwed off of the bottle, and revealed a little clear cap thing, which wasn&#x27;t great. I struggled to get the silver cap back on, and hopefully it won&#x27;t happen again. If I could have given a 4 1/2 star rating, I definitely would have. :)&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this product, and I&#x27;m excited to use them more, and possibly try more products from Shany Cosmetics in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Jane</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS NAIL ART KIT!! So MANY BRIGHT AND NEON COLORS! THE COLOR YOU SEE IN THE BOTTLES ARE TRUE TO COLOR...VERY BEAUTIFUL!!!  THEY ARE VERY FAST DRYING, THE POLISHES DO NOT CHIP, AND DID I MENTION THEY ARE BRIGHT AND TRUE TO COLOR!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to try these polishes because of the low price but decided they were worth the risk, and I&#x27;m glad I did. They arrived in a heavy duty cardboard box with a plastic tray to hold them all upright and in place, so there had been no breaking or leaking in shipping like I have experienced with other brands I&#x27;ve ordered online. They come with thin brushes to make lines or stripes on nails. If you wanted to use these to paint the whole nail you might want to buy a larger brush to use. These brushes would get the job done but would require more strokes to paint the entire nail. The polish itself glides on smoothly and is a good thickness. The colors seem to be boldly pigmented and apply true to color on your nails. All in all these are good quality polishes, certainly comparable to most brands you would find locally and for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these almost a month, and at first it worked really well.  But after about 8 uses the nail polish has gotten very thick and is hard to use.  Next time I would buy nail art brushes instead of these striper.</li>
    <li> Literally just received the polish and immediately tried it out, I love it! The colors are so pretty and vibrant and the brushes are perfect for nail art, delivery was on time and nothing was damaged in any way, great product!</li>
    <li> This kit contains a few neon colors, some metallics, some glitters and a wide range of mattes. This was not in the description when I bought it, so it was a pleasant surprise. I was expecting just mattes. They are fine-tip brushes made for nail art. Overall a very nice little set for a very low price.</li>
    <li> I received the Shany Nail Art Set today!!!  I ordered it for my daughters as a surprise.  I was going to wait to give it to them, but I was too excited!!!  When they opened it up, they were so happy!!!  They immediately started figuring out plans on what to do with them.  They came in great colors too!!!  We are all very happy with the item we received and look forward to ordering more items, from Shany, in the future!!!</li>
    <li> The quality of the product is not worth it.  The colors are diluted and are not as they appear on the bottle.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for someone who&#x27;s learning how to do nail art..I bought it to practice on my daughters fingers and its great.&lt;br /&gt;It was packaged perfectly and arrived in perfect condition.No broken bottles and came in a black box with a neat display case.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering from Amazon again..Thank you for this wonderful product...</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with these nail polishes. Great colors. I was worried with the reviews about not getting all colors but i did. I also bought one konad polish and i actually like these better. I will buy again from this company. Also they shipped this 2 weeks earlier than amazon said they would. So i am very excited to play with them</li>
    <li> I personally think that the brushes should be slightly longer but an amazing product for the price.</li>
    <li> I love the assortment especially for the price. Only thing, some are light&amp; require a light base to work. But at least 75% at dark. Overall, I would buy again. Great deal</li>
    <li> Really nice color selection and arrived very quickly. However, some of the colors are not opaque and barely show up over nail polish.</li>
    <li> Received these as a gift and I love them!!!! They are amazing quality! The polish itself is very opege and the formula is also very smooth works well over other polishes. It came with 24 different colors some are a bit similar but aren&#x27;t the same. I love doing my own nails and this is an added bonus. I definitely recommend this set and will repurchase once I use up mine since I do my nails very often. I did add my own pictures and tried including swatches even if it&#x27;s not very good lighting you could still tell the colors aren&#x27;t the same!</li>
    <li> My 13 year old daughter loves this kit.  She has had so much fun creating different nail art patterns.  The colors are vibrant and really last.  Hours of fun for my teenage girls.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with these!  They dry quickly, they are bold and nice quality.  24 colors is a huge variety and I will be using these every day!</li>
    <li> Pros I found:&lt;br /&gt;1. I definitely love the colors, and they came in this cool little package.&lt;br /&gt;2. The delivery was a day early, so that is also a plus.&lt;br /&gt;3. I love how the polish dries almost instantly.&lt;br /&gt;4. I was also very pleased when one coat was enough per nail!&lt;br /&gt;5. Considering how much singular bottles of nail polish cost at our local grocery stores and such, this bundle is definitely a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons I found:&lt;br /&gt;1. Of course, you have to have top coat in order to do designs, because although the polish dries almost instantly (I waited a day before I did designs because I was afraid of screwing them up, initially)  it still mixes with other colors you try to use. White didn&#x27;t show well over the blue I used. I don&#x27;t have any topcoat, unfortunately, so I&#x27;ll have to wait until I do to start doing fancy nails.&lt;br /&gt;2. Don&#x27;t do dishes or any household chores unless you have top coat on as well. This polish chips very easily. I didn&#x27;t have it on for more than 8 hours before it chipped to the point I had to remove it from my nails.&lt;br /&gt;3. Unless you have super extra strength nail polish remover, that stuff ain&#x27;t comin&#x27; off your nails. Hahah&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good still outnumbers the iffy, but I&#x27;m still quite happy with the product.</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful and fast drying, only con are the brushes are not even as some of them have really one long string pieces, no biggie as I just trimmed off myself.</li>
    <li> this product was packaged correctly and it was exactly what i was looking for. i was excited to see the package arrive on the day it was estimated. Very excited to start using it!!!</li>
    <li> I just receive my nail polish today  and im really happy about it I dont have any complaints..LOVE THE COLORS AND LOVE THAT  WAS CHEAP</li>
    <li> Beautiful and well packed! Used a lot already. The brushes are perfect for designs, easy to control.</li>
    <li> I was able to snag this set for $15 and it was a steal. The colors come out fine and last pretty long. The only downfall is that some brushes have staggered bristles sticking out. This can easily be solved by cutting it off with scissors.</li>
    <li> Brushes have tiny tips, not a typical nail polish brush. Maybe more for detail work? Not quite what I planned on. Fun colors, just not as usuable as i hoped.</li>
    <li> This has a great assortment of colors! I use them monthly and change the colors for different designs. Only thing is the polish starts coming off after about a week but it dries pretty fast!</li>
    <li> The nail polish is amazing. Very fond of this product. I love the colors, the perfect collection for color schemes and designs. The only issue is also necessary for one of the more positive aspects of the product. The brush is incredibly tiny, leaving it to be difficult to paint a nail. With that said though, its extremely east to do nail art with this, and easy to handle. The lip of the bottle is small enough to were if it tips over open it takes a while for product to leak out. For the price I would say is the an incredible product and possibly the best on the market in comparison with similar products and pricing. Very pleased. Thanks to the company and seller :)</li>
    <li> I love it , lots of colors and fun and different ways to do your nails , will definitely reorder this</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! THANK YOU! it can on time and looked like it did as advertised. im very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Love all the great nail colors. I can now create my own custom unique nail designs with out having to pay some one else to do it. Their great!</li>
    <li> This is great and I am enjoying all the different colors. I think they work good and I like them all..</li>
    <li> I have bought this set before and will buy it again.  These are intended for nail art so the brushes are thin. Yes occasionally the brushes are a little messed up, but you can easily just clean the brush and cut it the way you want. Trust me it works out even better. I have been able to do so many cool designs with this set I absolutely love it. It definitely beats buying one buy one at any drug store. I definitely recommend this set!</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast delivery. Thanks</li>
    <li> A great combination of colors in an easy to use form.  The nail art brushes are great and you can use them to create a number of styles and designs.</li>
    <li> The variety of colors is great, and the bottles are full to the top with polish.  With these I am able to create unique designs with ease, designs that I could not accomplish otherwise.  The quality is great and the polish doesn&#x27;t start to chip for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This review was written by my 15 year old daughter.)</li>
    <li> Love all the colors. For a person love me who likes to keep my life simple, and save money and shop smart. This is truly great for me, because I do my own nails. Now my mom wants me to start doing hers too.  This is a continue buy for me.</li>
    <li> I love my nail art set.... a good variety of colors... some a little light than most but over all an great set to have in your arsenal...  love them</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift set for an artsy fartsy friend who jokingly said, &amp;#34;get me nail polish or something&amp;#34; when I asked her what she would like for her birthday. I cannot believe this set actually exists. She is going to create masterpieces on her fingers with all these amazing options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Have you ever shopped on Amazon before? This place is FRICKIN CRAZY! They have everything. They have stuff I didn&#x27;t even know existed much less considered buying. I&#x27;m pretty sure that EVERYONE should spend one day just browsing. You gain so much knowledge just from looking. Oh, and the customer service is OFF THE CHAIN!. Need something replaced? No problem. Something arrived in less than perfect condition, NO PROBLEM! I frickin love this Nail Art Set and i FRICKIN L.O.V.E. AMAZON!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with these nail polishes! Came just in time for St Patricks Day! :) I would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> Everything is great :) Love the color variety!</li>
    <li> Gift for my niece and she loved it.</li>
    <li> A great item! The bottles are nice and big. The colors are beautiful and vibrant; there are so many different shades (mattes and shimmer). Definitely a really good deal.</li>
    <li> This was a present for my 13 year old niece and she absolutely LOVED it. She wanted to paint everyone&#x27;s nails right away! :)</li>
    <li> This is a great set of art nail polish offered by Amazon.com. A fine group of bright colors to choose from foor your artistic endevours. Fine brush tips for a personal artistic touch. This is a great set for the beginner as well as the accomplished nail art technician.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised</li>
    <li> some polishes were too thick and brush bent.</li>
    <li> 2 Of the glitter polishes were completely dried out. the rest worked pretty well. the polish was thick enough to show up but thin enough for detail work.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful set of colors for my nails.</li>
    <li> I bought this polish for my teen daughter and I was very glad to open it and find an assortment of colors and not multiple duplicate colors. HOWEVER, there was polish on the outside of some of the polishes which tells me that they had been opened and possibly even used prior to shipping them….even though I ordered these as new, and not used. I also saw the same issues that other people had complained about in their reviews, and that was the fact that some of the brush tips have slightly longer bristles hanging at the tips which won&#x27;t allow for a clean thin line and the tips are pretty thick, not as thin as some others that I have purchased before. Over all, the polish is ok, my daughter loves them and because she is just learning the thicker tips aren&#x27;t that big of a deal for her and we simply had to trim the ends of some of the bristles with scissors. I do like the clear thin plastic container they came in because it allows for my daughter to put them away neatly until we can get her a stronger case for her entire polish collection. Overall these are not a bad addition to her collection, just took a little bit of extra work on our ends by having to trim the ends of the brushes.</li>
    <li> It came zuper fast so many different colors I opened each one and tried it it dries fast and comes on thick brushes r perfect for nail decorations nothing was broken no duplicates deff qill order these again</li>
    <li> What a great set of polishes, since the brush is very fine you don&#x27;t have to have separate brushes to &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; decos on your nails.  They hold up great and the selection of colors is outstanding!</li>
    <li> .I bought this for a Christmas present, it was shipped fast and the packaging was great. I sure the young lady I bought it for will be happy.</li>
    <li> So my husband bought this as an Xmas present and gave it to me early. I had one bottle that had leaked, which might have been caused by shipping...who knows. I love all the color combos. I was a little bit disappointed that they weren&#x27;t for base coats and the bottles were a bit on the small side. My husband had no idea that they weren&#x27;t meant for base coats. He is a man after all...I don&#x27;t expect him to know. The color did take close to an hour to dry and with 2 kids, it&#x27;s a bit of a pain...but overall a small price to pay for the cute colors.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this set as it has great colors and it was on sale.  Upon receiving it I spent that night trying 10 of the colors to get a feel for how they go on and what they look like when applied.  First thing I noticed is 5 of the 10 I opened had brushes with strands that are longer than the rest of the brush.  This presents a problem when trying to do detail work or just painting.  If I use these again I will have to cut the long ones which is going to be both messy and time consuming which I am not excited about.&lt;br /&gt;Onto the real issues though:&lt;br /&gt;1. I let the color dry overnight and when I applied the topcoat the next morning some of the colors bled off into the clear.  (Namely the pink, dark green, and blue).&lt;br /&gt;2. After about 3-4 days it started chipping and despite having a base coat it took some layers of my nail with it. Making some of them so thin they had to be cut and causing a couple to be weak and break.  (I find sometimes with certain polishes this happens, I believe it is the chemical mix of the ingredients.  It doesn’t seem to matter cheap or expensive some just seem to be easier on nails than others.)&lt;br /&gt;3. Lastly when I went to remove the polish on the 4th day the dark blue and dark green actually stained both my nail and fingers.  I started using regular nail polish remover and when this happened I pulled out my 100% acetone to get the blue off.  Though it did come off my skin my nail is still tinged blue and it has been a week since I removed the polish.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it will now be an Expensive shelf hog, paper weight or end up as &#x27;toxic waste&#x27; somewhere (as it cannot be returned).&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend getting this set as it was disappointing.  If anyone has any pointers on how I might make it usable (ie brands or tips with types of sealers) please feel free to comment as suggestions are welcome.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I gave one bottle of this to my wife early....she doesn&#x27;t know that she&#x27;s going to be getting this for Christmas. She likes to paint my three year old daughter&#x27;s toes and fingers for fun...you know, girl stuff.  This nail polish of course has the standard horrible nail polish smell, which I tell you, one day someone will make a billion dollars making nail polish that doesn&#x27;t smell like chemical death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail polish did well and my wife reports that it cracks less than other brands that she&#x27;s had. She wants more...which is great news because I happen to have 23 other bottles of it ready to go in less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was done in a tasteful cardboard box, tightly and securely wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHORT AND SWEET: Great buy for the ladies!</li>
    <li> I love these nail art polishes great price and i love the colours my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t order more at the time.I will be ordering more of these.</li>
    <li> The price is amazing but it dries incredibly slow and I have to do 4-5 coats for it not to have streaks and look runny. I bought sally hansens quick dry that is supposed to dry it one minute but still takes a long time to dry. I have to usually wait 45-60min before I feel safe to touch anything or it will &amp;#34;dent&amp;#34; the nail polish. Colors are vibrant and I love them. The brush is also extremely skinny which is bad for the whole nail but great for design work.</li>
    <li> I received these for Christmas and I am obsessed with them! Great color and pigmentation! 5 out of 5  stars!</li>
    <li> I opened the box and it smelled really strong like the nail polish had spilled out but upon inspection I did not see any leaks. The colors are great! They look much better in person than they do on the picture. I have yet to try them so I cannot comment on the quality just yet.</li>
    <li> So many colors come in this kit and the quality is great! the polish is smooth and very opaque, it has a solid and good sized striper for the brush and they are of good size too!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and she loves it</li>
    <li> This set of nail polish was a wonderful gift I purchased for my niece whom loved it so much it got me to try them out and I absolutely loved them. The colors are so bright and vibrant it just makes my nails pop. I have to have more!</li>
    <li> I love the shany nail art set very nice colors the only problem that I had with it is that one or two of the colors were damaged a little bit but other wise excellent!!</li>
    <li> I have been doing nails for years but now just for my close friends.  I was in need of this particular item and I am SO HAPPY!  The colors are deep and true.  The brushes are fine so precise application is no problem.  It&#x27;s affordable.  The shipping was fast.  The packing was excellent.  I HIGHLY recommend this product and the seller.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> i love this i have fun every time i use it very very happy with it and so do my girls</li>
    <li> This works better with fake application nails. Not for regular nails. You also need to get a base coat polish for the nail art to work best. I am going to get OPI and apply that first, then use the Nail Art; but I will use only fake nails. There really pretty colors, all of them arrived in a beautiful little case. I thought it was really fancy.</li>
    <li> This nail polish is beautiful. It lasts long and the color is very bright. I definitely would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Got this for my niece and she said it was perfect!  Loved the variety of the colors and the case it comes it.  Keeps them nice n neat.</li>
    <li> I just love the quality of these nail polish stripers, and all of the colors. There is just about every single color that I could want! 3 of the nail polish bottles appear to have leaked, but none of the bottles were wet on the outside. I will probably purchase some more products from SHANY.</li>
    <li> i received this set as a gift and i love the variety of colors! there is literally a color for every outfit i own and i personally love matching my nail polish with the clothing i wear :) the color is easy to apply and LONG lasting.so far i have been wearing the same color for exactly a week and it doesn&#x27;t even chip yet.so happy i received this gift and i recommend this set to everybody!</li>
    <li> I thought these were nail polishes but they are not, the brushes on them are tiny, but it&#x27;s my fault because I never use nail art.</li>
    <li> if you do your nails as much as I do mine this is the prefect tool. Love all the colors and they show up very well. Best product I brought.</li>
    <li> I choose this rating b/c I loved the different colors.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it mainly since it was very handy to use wherever you go.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend his to anyone.</li>
    <li> Nice colors and unique.  Does the artistic work wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the collection and hope you have more coming out.</li>
    <li> Got this for my best friend&#x27;s birthday! She loves the colors. I love the colors. Lots of nice polish for a really nice price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Lots of colors.&lt;br /&gt;Great Price&lt;br /&gt;Small and Easy to carry around&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Brushes are small and impossible to use&lt;br /&gt;Should be some lighter colors</li>
    <li> I was really happy with the array of colors.  There is a good selection of metallics, patels and bright bold colors.  I tried a couple of the colors as a base coat but the polish was a little too thick and sticky so I&#x27;ll either thin it our use it for nail art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still think it was a great deal.</li>
    <li> Tiny pinpoint brushes for detail painting, takes a little longer if you&#x27;re wanting to paint the whole nail with the color, but I assume you could purchase a separate wider brush and use an acetone dip to clear the brush when you&#x27;re done.  Vibrant colors, my daughter was awe struck when she saw them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for those who want to do some detailing on the nails!  Packaged and shipped securely, no breakage or leaking.</li>
    <li> When I got the shany nail art set I wasn&#x27;t sure if they would work or not but when I got them I tried them on my nails and they were amazing!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am not a nail professional. I am a grandma who loves painting my granddaughter&#x27;s nails. She actually picked this out and was very excited when it arrived from Shany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was the strong smell of nail polish. This is awesome, because the second thing I noticed (which came from the first) is that these polishes dry quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe they are intended for nail art - on top of nail polish - but I tried them out alone without nail polish underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, these have very nice SMALL brushes. While this is because they are intended as nail art, it makes it extra easy for kids to apply. I wish ALL of my nail polishes had such nicely small brushes. However, because the brushes are flexible, you may want to use sticks if you are doing detailed art on your fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because these are intended for nail art, if you want them to last you will need to put a clear cover coating on top of them so that they don&#x27;t peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the glitter polish didn&#x27;t seem to scrape off as easily as the flat, it felt rough to the touch - and should also be coated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors were true on my fingernails when I tested them, and my granddaughter is pleased to have me touch her up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have removed a star because one of the bottles had leaked slightly and the top couldn&#x27;t be removed. Otherwise, an excellent selection of nail art colors - fast drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shany sent the set to me as a complimentary sample to test for a review, and I am happy to be able to report a good experience with the set I received.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this. She only wanted black, white and silver; but you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Works great!  If I could just get her to keep the polish  on long enough. She&#x27;s constantly changing designs!</li>
    <li> This kit surpassed or expectations!  We are going to have so much fun doing nail art!  Thank you for a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Unlike other reviews I got all the colors and nothing was leaking. I&amp;#34;m very pleased with this product. Lots of great colors.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I use it all of the time, almost every day. I think that the colors are beautiful and they really pop out on my nails. Also it lasts on my nails for along time. It lasts about two and a half weeks which is a long time for nail art.</li>
    <li> Came in great packaging. Made it really easy to wrap. No duplicate colors. All the colors were numbered. Good quality polish.</li>
    <li> These are great!&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re all pretty colors! Some are similar looking but different shades. They stink like nail polish for sure but they look pretty on your nails as they do in the bottle. They didn&#x27;t wear well on my nails but I think that&#x27;s only because I had to hand wash my dishes for a week because the dishwasher was broken and needed to be fixed. It&#x27;s fixed now so I&#x27;m going to try again. But I love them!</li>
    <li> I am really love this nail polishes. The price is reasonable and the color selection is awesome. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> The product is awesome. If I&#x27;m not mistaken there are 2 vendors for this product, make sure you get this one. I received the exact colors that are listed in a neat plastic holder (nothing fancy) you can use it forever. the bottles are very snug in the case :). the colors are bright and opaque. I love this product. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work good with my gel polish</li>
    <li> Terrible brush. It&#x27;s super tiny and thin.</li>
    <li> I received these an I thought they would be brand new but one bottle had a leak.&lt;br /&gt;Two bottles had polish already on the thread of the screw part. And one bottle was dirty with polish and a finger print.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll also get some that are pretty much unusable; certain colors had a too thick or too thin consistency &amp; some of the colors barely showed up/pigment was weak. On the other hand, I&#x27;d say about 1/3 to 1/2 of the polishes in the set had a strong pigment &amp; applied nicely. The brush quality also varied, expect bristles to go rogue &amp; some are misshapen, you can alter the brushes with scissors if you prefer the bristles shorter as they are quite long. All in all this didn&#x27;t bother me too much considering the cost of the set, I think this is good for someone who wants to try nail art before spending the outrageous prices on other brands for a single polish. I would NOT recommend as a gift.</li>
    <li> I love this nail set. The thickness of the brush are similar to that of a nail striper (maybe a little thicker). I use these for designs on my nails. I have to wipe off the excess polish before I design because as I design, sometimes a ball of polish falls down the brush. I also use them to paint my nails normally by using the whole brush and not just the very tip. This kit is very good for beginners as well as intermediate nail designers. I&#x27;ve only had great experiences with them, people always think I got my nails professionally done because you can do such detailed designs with these. The only difficulty is when you have to put on another coat after doing an intricate design, but that is expected. :) love this kit! It&#x27;s fun to mess around with and try new designs without having to buy a ton of nail tools!</li>
    <li> Got this for my step daughter and she loves it. She&#x27;s very pleased with all the colors.</li>
    <li> These polishes seem old. They are thick, sticky, and do not dry. Unable to return the item because it is a &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34; per amazon policy. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> So many different color options and nice applicator.  Good for dots and lines and painting the nail.</li>
    <li> I gave this 5 stars because the case came in perfect condition and on time. The only minor issue was that one of the polishes spilled out a little on the side, and I knew it because you can smell the nail polish, but the amount of the spilled was not enough to give a negative review. pretty good product and would will be buying one for my nieces.</li>
    <li> Lousy quality. So thin, it&#x27;s impossible to use it for small designs.  Glad I got it for a great deal.</li>
    <li> Great product for prize.</li>
    <li> actually i&#x27;m David&#x27;s wife and am in love with your product students and peers at beauty school are asking where they can get some.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice set. I have used about half of the colors and am very impressed with the coverage that we get with these.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. None of the colors are solid enough to show up very well. Highly disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> The other reviews said they received the product broken or leaked, but mine came perfectly. Do not be afraid to buy because the people that had the nail polish leak was in 2012 or 2013. These stripers are really easy to make fun and cute designs with. You get 24 polishes for 20$! That&#x27;s less than 1 dollar per striper! Again, this is an amazing buy and a must have for nail polish addicts (like me)</li>
    <li> All colors you need, then any you do not like give a bottle to a friend, a color they like.  Or save the colors that are not what you like and give as a gift. So many colors and you may wear what matches your clothing-I get complements all the time on how bright and pretty my nails are.</li>
    <li> The only nail polish I will ever use now. Comes with so many bright colors. I love this product it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I ordered it exactly last year..They are gud for nail art but when you apply them as a polish to ur nails...they do turn out well but they will brittle and get cracks easily...as far as to jus do some art on ur nails, these are okay I felt....But I feel like using them as nail polish as they are so many bottles to finish off...I dont like them much!</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick and packaged well, but the polish is gummy and obviously old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the description it states that the brush is &amp;#34;fine.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we opened a bottle the brush is a striper. That is not what we expected as we wanted multiple polishes to be used as an actual polish and for the brush set we bought. I realize it says nail art, but the description is not detailed enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used a regular brush and the polish quality is still bad. Not sending it back, just going to add some nail polish remover to thin it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it only one star because the polish quality is so terrible.</li>
    <li> Negatives&lt;br /&gt;Some of the brushes hairs fall out.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the brushes fall out of the caps so you cant use them.&lt;br /&gt;Kinda cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives&lt;br /&gt;Packaged nicely and non broke during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Good variety of colors.&lt;br /&gt;Good price for value.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a plastic rack for nice storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Its a great deal and I enjoy it every much.</li>
    <li> Love the product and my granddaughters are loving using this and making a nail salon right here in the house.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not the greatest quality</li>
    <li> Gets clumpy very fast.</li>
    <li> This is a great cheap set for keeping kids entertained. Probably best to have them get crazy with paint outside or in a controlled space but it allows endless amounts of fun and creativity. do know the fumes dont smell that great so make sure you have a well ventilated space when using.</li>
    <li> I bought this set as a birthday gift for my 7th grader who loves to do nails. Three of the polishes were leaking and had dried up around the top when my daughter received them. I had to clean off those bottles prior to her first use, but luckily there was still some polish left in them. However, this did not dampen my daughter&#x27;s spirit and she still loved the gift overall.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works perfectly. Many colors to use in nail art design. That&#x27;s wonderful. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> The product shipped quickly and was exactly as expected.  The only issue I had was with the brushes was that a few brushes had issues with strands sticking out and refusing to behave.  It was good quality for the price, though.</li>
    <li> Colors are brilliant.. All bold and beautiful.... Problem is brushes. Brushes have pointy tips, can&#x27;t use to paint whole nail, only for art. Also brush hair keeps on falling all the time. Good for experts who have their own brushes to use. Also it took 3 months to deliver. I also got a call from amazon after 2 months if I still want them. Well I was in no hurry, so i didn&#x27;t cancel the order. But if you want it in right time, make sure its available and would reach in time before ordering.....&lt;br /&gt;I am giving 4 stars because of great color collection.. just beautiful!!</li>
    <li> it was birthday gift for daughter&#x27;s friend and all the girls at party had fun with it. highly recommend the seller.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s pictured and just what I was looking for! The variety of colors and quality is perfect! My 12 year old daughter uses them!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with these stripers. The bottles came around 3-4 days early, and they were tightly packed inside 2 boxes. There was only 1 repeat in colors, but it was the silver one which I use a lot. The colors are very bright and they dry quickly (if you don&#x27;t put on a bunch at a time) I am looking forward to buying shiny products again.</li>
    <li> I loved all the colors you get. Some seem really sheer though so need more than one coat which can be difficult when doing a design.</li>
    <li> Im thrilled it was exactly as i wanted. It had so many cute colors and varieties. Bought this as a gift for my cousin and she loves it.good quanity and quality :)</li>
    <li> I know nothing about quality in this area, but this was a gift and my daughter thought it was nice but sort of cheap.</li>
    <li> Plenty of nice colors at a good price for my wife, good for nail art however unable to be used as normal nail polish due to the small brushes.</li>
    <li> Some bottle lids were cracked or scratched. But makes a great give away item for a party. Perhaps the defects were from shipping... Overall, the bulk price is worth it.</li>
    <li> The wife is happy now.</li>
    <li> I love this nail art set, it came quickly and it is a very nice consistancy of Polish for designs.</li>
    <li> Great set! Every color you could ever want! Good nail polish that goes on easily and is not clumpy, with thin brush that applies in accurately and precisely!</li>
    <li> Nice consistency! The polishes are beautiful and are not too thin or thick, making it easy to apply. I would highly recommend them. These colors are just fantastic, fun, and rich. All of the colors look good, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about only using a few. They&#x27;re also shipped quickly with good packaging. I know I&#x27;ll be buying these again once the old ones finish out, so I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> much more than I had expected. I&#x27;m in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesoomee!!</li>
    <li> These are so gummy you can&#x27;t do anything with them. Awful!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice set. I have used about half of the colors and am very impressed with the coverage that we get with these.</li>
    <li> Great colors!!!!  Fast delivery.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Quality: A+&lt;br /&gt;Variety: A+&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: A+&lt;br /&gt;Shipping: A+&lt;br /&gt;Easy of Use: A+&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> Very pretty colors true to the pictures. Came with 5 different colors of sparkles with add so much to a simple design. Only gave it 4 stars because the polish has a strange smell not like normal polish which I use mostly opi</li>
    <li> I love that I can get this many colors for like $20. That&#x27;s awesome. That bumps it up a star just for that reason alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the things you will need to be prepared to do with these polishes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Prepare yourself for the possibility of duplicate colors. My set came with all the colors promised, but so many other reviewers have said they got duplicates that I just sort of assumed when I ordered this that I would get dupes. So I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Use nail polish thinner. The formula is thicker than it really should be with nail art, so I have started putting about half a dropper of Seche Restore in the bottle and then rolling it before I even bother starting to put any of these lacquers on my nails. On the plus side, once I&#x27;ve done that, they spread beautifully and I like how vivid the colors are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Close and roll/shake often. Even if you haven&#x27;t put any nail polish thinner into this stuff, it seems to separate quickly. I can work with about three nails before I have to cap it and roll it again, or it gets too tacky to work with. Annoying for lacquer meant for nail art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Trim the brushes. With every single bottle I&#x27;ve opened so far (I haven&#x27;t used all the colors, but I&#x27;ve used at least half by now), the brush has had a bristle or two that sticks way, way out on the end. Some people might prefer this for detail work, and some people might have their own nail art brushes to work with. But if you don&#x27;t, and if you plan on using the brushes that came in this bottle, I recommend taking your nail clippers or another pair of small scissors and just trimming the ends to make them angle the way that you&#x27;re comfortable working with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- If you&#x27;re using one of the colors to coat your whole nail, I recommend using two coats of base coat. Some of the colors are very heavily pigmented and the pigment is grainy. It&#x27;s difficult to remove even with acetone. Using two coats of base coat before I put these colors on has helped with this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - I paid cheap money, and got lots of somewhat cheap polish for my cheap money. I would say I still got better than I paid for, since I paid less than a dollar a bottle. Four stars, and I&#x27;ll probably buy it again if I ever need to.</li>
    <li> One came and was half empty and very hard. It was still a good value for the amount of colors I was able to use.</li>
    <li> The person I brought this for really love this product.  She say there&#x27;s enough color for every occasions.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> I have been doing nail art and such for about 6 years now and I&#x27;ve always just used a color close to what I wanted, These are perfect! I love them! So glad that they come in both a solid color and a glitter version of it! Adorable. My only concern was that the black was a little thick. Other than that, Perfect! Definitely worth it!!</li>
    <li> Came in record time!  Loved the colors and was bigger bottles than expected!! Lovely quality nail polish !</li>
    <li> The colors were very diluted.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this.</li>
    <li> Thank you for my order.  I received 24 different colors.  So excited.  Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> I love this set because it has some fantastic trendy colors, but doesn&#x27;t force you into buying a LOT of any particular fashion color.  I mean, who wants to have a 3-year supply of a nail color that&#x27;s only going to be in season for 3 months?  My only complaint is that the brush is really, really tiny but I think that&#x27;s probably desirable to a lot of folks who buy this because it allows for fine detail work.  I&#x27;m lazier and just want to paint my nails crazy solids so I&#x27;ve just been using the brush from an older bottle of polish and cleaning it each time.  That seems to work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of these polishes isn&#x27;t A++, but this is a variety set so I didn&#x27;t really expect that.  If I use base and top coats of a good quality, I find these last without chipping for probably a week (maybe two if I&#x27;m being really careful).  So that&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;Colors are BRIGHT and fun&lt;br /&gt;Price is reasonable for the variety you get&lt;br /&gt;Amount of product is perfect for trendy colors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marginal:&lt;br /&gt;Brush size is too small for easily painting a color over a whole nail (again, great if you&#x27;re doing detailed work)&lt;br /&gt;Chips fairly easily if you do not use proper base/top coats&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  A great value that will give you lots of creative fun options for nail colors/art!</li>
    <li> Some of the polish was OK. Others were way too thick and gloppy and smelled so strongly like chemicals it made my eyes water.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THE COLORS!! Hate the size of the brushes and does seem to take a little while to dry.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Great colors and well worth the money. Only con is i got 2 of the same color but atleast its a nice color.</li>
    <li> The colors are gorgeous and dry quickly, perfect for stamp art or any other type of nail art. This brand is awesome!!!</li>
    <li> love the bright colors will make a great gift for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Pretty colors but the brush was super thin.and the liquid was pretty was very thick. I threw them away</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried every color yet but I have tried half and for the purpose of nail design only and not coloring an entire nail they work just fine for me. (I&#x27;m not a professional just bored at home trying to be creative with my nails)</li>
    <li> Nice haven&#x27;t tried yet</li>
    <li> hate the way it flows.....colors are good but the quality and the way polish flows through the brush is not good...</li>
    <li> already dried half. Thin Brush. sticky while applying.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews but I decided to do so about the nail polish set. First of all I paid $19.99 for my set! I would never pay the price they are asking now! U recieved my order in just a few days packaging was great! Also after reading several complaints I have to say my set has all different colors no two alike! No spills or messes either! I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer! : )</li>
    <li> We had 2  of the polish bottles bust when my daughter was trying to open them.  She ended up getting cut and had nail polish all over the bathroom counter.  Not a happy customer!!!  Be careful if you are giving these to children.  They are dangerous.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this set! I&#x27;ve been doing my own gel builder nails for 6 months. I&#x27;ve gotten pretty close to professional. My friends and family have me do all their nails and this set was brand spanking new... Arrived in a good amount of time... Still in original plastic and in a nice tray! 100% love! Good color selection too!!!!</li>
    <li> Great selection of colors and shipped in the original box which makes for a great gift.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s review: Exactly what I wanted. I do subtle designs on my nails. They are not the best quality BUT you are paying less than a dollar for each color. I feel they are perfectly priced for my needs.</li>
    <li> brushes are uneven with hairs falling out and the pigments is too light in most. A lot of colors will only show up on white or very light backgrounds</li>
    <li> I would return these if I could.  The package contained 2 bottles with the lids loose.  They had dried polish around the top and were next to impossible to open.  I have used 4 of the polishes so far.  The polish is VERY brittle when it dries and cracks off with in an hour of applying.  If you enjoy painting, re-painting, and painting again, then this is the polish for you.  If you want to be able to get more than a few minutes of wear from your polish, please avoid this product.</li>
    <li> There are so many colors that come with this so I just had to give it a shot. The nail polish itself is a little more runny than usual so you have to be more careful or you could make a huge mess. The brush is too thin in my opinion. But, overall it works well enough and for the price, I really can&#x27;t complain. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> this was delivered damaged and would like to get my money back. I paid for 24 nail art colors and got them all damaged!!!</li>
    <li> These little bottles  are so perfect for nail art.  They are so much better than my usual stripers that the brush ends up dried out and bent after a few uses.  The brush is higher quality and just so easy to maneuver.  Christmas night, I took off my Christmas art nails, and did a beautiful pink glitter french tip with these, and have gotten so many compliments about them.  It does take a little bit for them to dry, but it is worth the trade off (fast drying vs beautiful, brilliant colors)  I am so grateful my in-laws bought these for me, and they are my favorite Christmas present.  Thank you, Shany for making such a great product!</li>
    <li> I received this product for Christmas and I was very pleased. I am looking forward to buying Shany products in the future</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!! First off, the price is unheard of!  I got 24 great colors, the polish is good quality,  it goes on smooth and really easy to use. I would HIGHLY recommend this product to any DIY&#x27;ers out there looking to add some design to your manicure!!! Great product anyone can use these whether  your a beginner or a pro</li>
    <li> Slim nail brushes lets you design whatever you want on each nail color, shapes, sizes, math, artistic designs. I made a yellow finger with a black happy face in honnor of the song &amp;#34;Because Im Happy&amp;#34; by Ferrell and many others... you create your own with multi color kit. I have up to 5 different colors on one nail. Up to you.... You are the Artist, Adult exploration, or/and Mother to Daughter &amp;#34;Girly Girl Time&amp;#34;  Totally fun, cool, neat, creative, and I get tons of compliments. I even did my feet, and my daughters hands and feet. You just Imagine. Design. Create. &amp;#34;Just Do IT&amp;#34; ...&lt;br /&gt;I am going to buy another set. And my mother wants a set. Wish I had more black polish as it separates colors from colors in a neat outline.... seller, please advise if I can purchase more black only polish (4)  and selected colors only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You.</li>
    <li> none were broken when we received it. a couple were real stringy at first and it doesn&#x27;t take long for the brush to curl and ruin on the black and white, also the polish got thick and gross pretty quickly. all other colors work well</li>
    <li> Love the colors. Can&#x27;t get enough of nail art polish. Needs more sparkly and glittery polish but other than that, I love designing nails with the colors I have</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m into nail design, so I was excited to see this product for the price.  It works nicely for the thicker colors (white, black, navy blue), but not so good with the others.  There were too many opague colors (yellow, neon yellow, light pink) so you can&#x27;t see the design on the nails.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what they say it is. I received it very quickly. The price is really good for how many you get.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife recently and she liked it very much. She said the colours were good and it was reasonable for the price.</li>
    <li> Colors are great!  Everything came wrapped and none of the bottles were broken or duplicated.  I found some colors to be better than others as far quality.  Some were thicker than others and I had to keep closing and shaking them to be able to work with it.  Overall they are great colors and I&#x27;ve used them on many nail art projects already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I did have to trim every single brush.  Each brush had one long strand that I just had to trim to get clean lines.</li>
    <li> This item was exactly as described.  I am very satisfied with the purchase and will purchase again from this merchant.</li>
    <li> Some bottles was half full and very watery other than that they are great</li>
    <li> I purchased this item in hopes of doing nail art, these are watery nail polishes that are nothing like the nail art paint used in salons.  Do not purchase if you are looking for something thicker.</li>
    <li> great price and colors but some of the bristles fall out as well as some were already bent when pulled out the first time so does not make trying for a smooth line etc. easy.  However for the price their not too bad just have a lil patients.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and the polishes are AMAZING 😃 Satisfied with my purchase :)</li>
    <li> I just received these today and I&#x27;m so excited to use them.</li>
    <li> Really nice and bright colors . Well Worth the money</li>
    <li> I love these nail stripers! I have used many of the colors, and they are pretty opaque. The white is not as opaque as some of the other brands that I have, but I am overall very satisfied with this item. It is a GREAT value for what you get! I would buy again- highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Very neat and handy, I love using them...</li>
    <li> Love it! So much fun!!!!</li>
    <li> love all the colors, i do wish the brush hairs were a little bit shorter and stiff so you have more control over your design</li>
    <li> My 13 yr old niece loves these!!!</li>
    <li> Lots of colors but they don&#x27;t dry :(</li>
    <li> My daughter does nail art all the time and constantly needed new colors, I haven&#x27;t had to buy any new ones since purchasing this set...she loves it!</li>
    <li> i love this.if you like to wear nail polish and create designs,this is for you. it doesn&#x27;t come with a regular bottle of polish,but if you like to make your own designs,this is for you.</li>
    <li> i got this set for Christmas and honestly i love it! they work so good. the colors are vibrant and dry very fast. it came with many different shades and colors that stay on for quite awhile. they are very easy to do small decorations with. i love them i have no complaints and would highly recommend this product to any one who love nail polish as much as i do</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister who is a nail polish fanatic! She is going to LOVE this!!&lt;br /&gt;It arrived VERY timely, nicely packaged, and I have absolutely no complaints.</li>
    <li> The colors that come in this pack are great, you can make just about any design with the color options. Though the complaints I have about this are that not all of the brushes are great quality (ie. bristles falling out, too thick, too thin, etc...) And the polish drys out and becomes thick very quickly. I understand that since the bottle is smaller than a normal nail polish, it will dry faster, but it should not dry as fast as it does. Three out of five stars because I expected better quality from SHANY cosmetics.</li>
    <li> This was ordered for a teenager. The set looked great but since it was an anonymous gift, I can&#x27;t really say if she liked it as much as I thought she would.</li>
    <li> There was a great array of colors, it showed up pretty quickly, and the nail paint is decent. I would have given five stars if you dont have to trim the random stray hairs on the ends of the brushes. The brushes aren&#x27;t even, and will have random pieces sticking out. Make sure you have scissors or nail clippers on hand to trip the randoms at the ends. You get what you pay for;) But this is a pretty great deal. Im an artist, but a newbie at painting my nails, so I am happy:)</li>
    <li> I LOVE love love love these!! You can&#x27;t beat the price. I usually go to the dollar tree and pay$1 for just ONE! This set has so many colors and they look amazing on my nails when I do designs.</li>
    <li> These polishes are beautifully pigmented and the nail art brushes are perfect for cute designs.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The polish came when expected, I had all of the colors and it even came on a stand with a slot for each of them. The polish stayed on for around 4 or 5 days before chipping. Everything was great. Almost. The smell. Make sure you are polishing your nails in a WELL ventilated room. It smells awful. I have never smelled such disgusting polish before. I was able to get over it. I just open the windows in the bathroom and turn on the fan.</li>
    <li> I love all the colors and the price was reasonable :) but the jars break easy .. do you have shany nail art set in different color then the ones shown?</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves them.  In fact I went to your website (shanycosmetics.com) I registered consider me a fan you have wonderful cosmetics.</li>
    <li> Love the colors! Very happy with this product. Dries great under all types of lights. Will definitely purchase more when needed.</li>
    <li> My niece is into doing nails, so I purchase this to help her when she does designs.  She loves it and has learned so much.  I purchase other things from Amazon to help her with developing her skills.  This was such an excellent gift.</li>
    <li> Lots of colors and great quality</li>
    <li> I received this very fast. All the colors were amazing! No broken bottles. They dried fast and we&#x27;re very opaque.  Some of the colors were dried around the opening but not an issue. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great quality and great price!</li>
    <li> Oh my! love these!!! my girls were in heaven! all the colors! what a great PRICE!!! My girls have been doing their nails EVERY second just because of these cool things! thank you !!! love love love!&lt;br /&gt;the colors are vibrant and beautiful! and easy to do designs!! thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this product because it works perfectly and is easy to apply. I have really been wanting something like this and the colors are just so vibrant and I really love it. They look really good on and are easy to take off.</li>
    <li> I already have black, silver glitter and white stripers and I think that they are great additions to a nail polish kit.  The colors in this kit are really diverse and lively, and I didn&#x27;t receive duplicates.  Some of the bottles had a little dried polish along the rim, but it probably wasn&#x27;t screwed on tightly enough (as opposed to USED).  The brushes are thin enough, but some also have little tips that need to be cut off prior to using for more even application.  Thus, the 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
    <li> Many of the brushes arrive with &amp;#34;wild bristles,&amp;#34; which isn&#x27;t very helpful if you are doing art.</li>
    <li> Waiting to hear from my niece - one of the bottles was half empty and the what was left in it was dried up - there was no polish in the packaging but the smell was very strong as though it has leaked.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Shany Nail Art Set (24 colors) thinking it may not be the best polish I&#x27;ve ever used due to the terrific price... I was wrong! The price does NOT reflect the quality at all as the polish goes on smoothly, dries quickly &amp; seems to be quite durable- Just like the professional quality polishes used at the salon! The brushes are just the right thickness to create beautiful designs &amp; allow enough product to be retained to produce long strokes, but not too much where the product drips. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the product &amp; will definitely be considering Shany Cosmetics for future purchases.[[ASIN:B005X2F7KI Shany Nail Art Set (24 Famouse Colors Nail Art Polish, Nail Art Decoration)]]</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter as a Christmas present  She loves it!!! It has lots of colors and brushes that allow her to create designs. I would recommend this item for any teen or tween.</li>
    <li> The glitter stripers don&#x27;t work so well</li>
    <li> My daughter LOVES these. They work very well for detailed nail decorating and dry pretty fast.</li>
    <li> Only had one that I could hardly open because nail polish was dried up around it. Other than that they&#x27;re wonder I use them all the time.</li>
    <li> beautiful colors, brushes are very thin allowing for nail art, although can be challenging if you want to use them for base color, as the brushes are thin you have to work many times your nail to get them covered</li>
    <li> There is no color white im very disapointed</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get any duplicates like some people but some of the colors were really close to each other. The brush was nice and long and the formula for the polish was a nice consistency but the colors were on the sheer side.</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gift for that special woman . She will be smiling and happy for sure. They look great and packaged amazingly.</li>
    <li> love the colors, got them for a great price!</li>
    <li> This set is a &amp;#34;get what you pay for&amp;#34; type of set. That being said, I liked it for the money I spent. The colors are very vibrant and I was fortunate enough to not having any duplicates in my set. Some are a little too thick for my liking but that can be fixed with a little polish thinner. I would say that going through each polish and clipping the very edge of the brushes will also help the application ( i noticed that a few of the brushes have one bristle that is a lot longer than the others which made it more difficult to get a clean line). All in all, I find this product to be great for the money I spent.</li>
    <li> Delivery was promptly.  Products in good order.  Would shop again.</li>
    <li> Good price, but the brush is to thik to make design with them</li>
    <li> The colors are bright and just what I wanted. The quality is good for the price. These are for nail designs so the brushes are thin. The assortment of colors and glitter is awesome!</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this set of nail polishes. They&#x27;re great even if you&#x27;re a beginner (like me) in regards to nail art. The price was great, so are the colors and the quality of the polishes. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I was able to get 24 different colors in such a cheap price.What more can I possibly ask for? The brushes need no trimming or anything, as soon as you get you can sue it.</li>
    <li> Sparkle are so watery.</li>
    <li> the glass shatters so easily if you drop it.</li>
    <li> Good nail polish set. Arrived quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It was missing #11, instead it had two #21&#x27;s. But hey, two dark sparkly blues isn&#x27;t too bad.&lt;br /&gt;Two of the bottles had leaked from the bottom of the cap a little tiny bit, but it was no big deal. It was probably because of how hot it has been recently...they still worked just fine. It just smelled really strong when I opened the package. But all bottles were intact.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are very narrow, this is definitely for nail art, not solid painting, unless you want to use a bigger brush.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little while to dry, but that&#x27;s also normal.&lt;br /&gt;This is good for nail art, narrow designs, dots, stripes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I also liked how when I accidentally got some on the skin on my hand, it came off easily.&lt;br /&gt;Comes off easily with nail polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;These would make a great gift!</li>
    <li> Great selection of colors!</li>
    <li> I hate this nail polish. It&#x27;s extremely thin, applies unevenly and takes FOREVER to dry. This MIGHT be good for nail at I suppose but it&#x27;s not for me. I will not buy this brand of polish again.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my wife to boost her collection.  She loves it.  We got two of one color but for less than $1 per bottle I can&#x27;t complain.  I let my wife paint my big toes so she could try this out and she seemed really happy with the results.  We left it on for a couple days and there wasn&#x27;t any chipping or cracking.  It ended up taking a bit of effort for her to get it off which she says is a good thing.</li>
    <li> Great packaging and fun gift for girls of any age</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t Buy this product. Quality of this product is very bad. you can not use it. If you use it it will last for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> One of the polishes was broken and blue nail polish spilled to other polishes.  This was a birthday gift for my niece&#x27;s party the following weekend so I couldn&#x27;t send it back.  She decided she didn&#x27;t want to go to the trouble of returning it and threw away the broken polish and cleaned the others.  Thankfully it was only a part of her gift but I was still disappointed.</li>
    <li> These nail art polishes are amazing the shipping was pretty good and all the polishes are bold and i loved the hot pink! i recomend this to every nail artist</li>
    <li> A few of the colors overflowed during shipping. Other than that, seems okay</li>
    <li> Some of the colors are too goopy to use, but most work ok. I may try to thin a couple out to make them usable. Lovely selection of colors though.</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking they were just nail polish, but my daughter seems to love using them. She paints her nails almost every other day and uses the colors to make some fun designs.</li>
    <li> There have been a few bad reviews on this product, but I think there in nothing wrong with this at all. I did have maybe 3 bottles that had stray brush hairs but that is nothing a pair of tweezers and a paper towel can&#x27;t fix. The polish seems to dry fairly fast and seems to be made pretty well. The smell is the same as any other nail polish.</li>
    <li> This was a very good price for the amount of colors! The nail polish is also fair quality. They all have the stripe brushes in each one, and came in a little stand.</li>
    <li> Wow !! Cant believe the value, variety and quality. Service was great too.  Would strongly recommend.  Thank You</li>
    <li> This came in a nice clear box of which I think I will continue to use for storage.  I first used them to strip my nails in a rainbow color, a little disappointed since in the picture it looks like you will receive an orange but it looks more yellow in person.  It didn&#x27;t stop me from overlapping colors to obtain a bright orange as desired.  Colors paint on smoothly and look great under a top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to do all kinds of designs!</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and packaged great all bottles were sealed and none was broke, I love the nail art colors. A great buy, and the cheapest on the internet, I am a licensed Cosmetologist that specializes  in Nail Design and I have searched all over the internet for nail art paints and to be able to buy all these colors at a great Bargain is a steal and is unbelievable, I&#x27;m happy I found Shany Nail Art Set and it saved me money! Now I have all colors!!!!!</li>
    <li> This set is great, I really like it, It&#x27;s perfect for everyday and you have a lot of color to choose from.</li>
    <li> Great value. Long brushes on polish are a little hard to get detailed results but I just use a different brush and get great results. Comes packaged really nice. Great for gift giving!</li>
    <li> the nail art polish arrived on time, and was exactly what was ordered. Future business with this seller will happen.</li>
    <li> I received my set and fell in love!!! So much choices of color, and very pretty bright and vibrant colors! Perfect!</li>
    <li> It came earlier than expected. It was what I order. The nail polish bottles was new and not filled half way. I didn&#x27;t get two of the same ones. I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Great selection of colors, these don&#x27;t chip, and the small brush makes it very easy to paint details!! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> My friend gave me this set for my birthday, and I&#x27;m obsessed with it.  The colors are vibrant, most of them come on smoothly, and they dry super quick.  My only problem is that a few of the polishes (like 05, this pinkish-orangish shade) are really thick and sticky and I can&#x27;t get them to come on smoothly.  But for the price, this is definitely worth it for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on nail polish.</li>
    <li> All I can say it suck!!!</li>
    <li> I love the colors. They are bright and they last several days! The only thing I do not like about the nailpolish is the applicator is thin. But the good part to it being thin is that you can get right up next to your cuticles easier.</li>
    <li> Love all of the colors! They are perfect for nail art. The brush is a nice size, it&#x27;s not too thick and you&#x27;re able to create a nice fine line.</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice and it works amazing! I have never done my own nail art until i got these but i am in love with them so far!</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was a set of actual nail polish.  I was really disappointed when I opened it up and saw a thin brush meant for designing!  Whoops.  I decided to play with them since I was stuck with the set anyways, and I&#x27;m obsessed.  I am definitely not a pro at nail design, but these make it really easy.  I especially like using the set for colorful french tips.  The quality of the polish is very good as well.  Even the glitter colors are substantial and only need 1-2 coats.  No chipping, either!</li>
    <li> not for professionals.</li>
    <li> With this price and i can have a lof of different choic of colors. This is a joy of my day. I will recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> Not great if you are an adult. Fine for my 7 year old.</li>
    <li> I love this set! I have used it several times. Great colors and easy to use. I do my own Gel manicures and I bought these to try my hand at nail art. They are really easy to use. I would not suggest them as an all over nail polish because of the consistency. They are for nail art just as the description states. Paint dries really quickly so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about smudging the art when putting on the top coat. I would suggest this product to everyone with interest in nail art!</li>
    <li> The colors are gorgeous, they even come on this tray that doesnt look bad at all so you could just place them on ur dresser and voila, i love this set it was worth every penny!</li>
    <li> In other reviews I read that the bottles leaked, and the polish itself took forever to dry.  I didn&#x27;t experience that.  The nail polish was packaged appropriately with zero leaks.  It&#x27;s nail polish, it takes a little while to dry.  But you get a LOT of nail polish for the price, and the color selection is awesome.  Love everything about this purchase.</li>
    <li> Love all the vibrant colors and all the variety , I could not wait to open  and use them ,very delighted , love trying new techniques</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with this nail polish for nail decoration.  The brushes are nice and fine, do great lines and even some dotting when one doesn&#x27;t want to change to the dotting tool.  There is a nice variety of colors which are bright and opaque enough to be seen when put over most other colors.  The white and black however, seemed a little thick, as though they were older than the rest of the colors, but I didn&#x27;t think that warranted taking a star away, so I went ahead with the five stars.</li>
    <li> I love this set. It&#x27;s got lots of great colors; it seems to have most of the basics. The little brushes are great for nail art. I&#x27;m just a beginner so I don&#x27;t know much about this stuff, but these work great for me as I learn what I&#x27;m doing. I only had a problem with one of the brushes being messed up.The white polish had a brush with one extra long bristle sticking out and it was messing up my designs; I fixed it by cutting off the long bristle with scissors, and now it&#x27;s not a problem anymore!</li>
    <li> It sort of clumps on the nails. but I like the fact that it has a thin like brush to paint the designs onto your nails.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom, who LOVES doing nails.&lt;br /&gt;Its so cute and has so many pretty colors i can image all sorts of designs on her nails lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything came perfect i even like the box that it was shipped in lol.&lt;br /&gt;Weird?</li>
    <li> Came fast. The blue was spilled and open when delivered.</li>
    <li> I love these!!! Came on time, packaged well and I am a professional cosmetologist and I&#x27;m so excited for my nail clients who will love all the new colors! Ok shany ready for my free samples and coupons!</li>
    <li> great price and quality</li>
    <li> Nice assortment  of colors.  My daughter loved it.</li>
    <li> I loved it very much. This is a fantastic buy for me. Check out my video review!!&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;L2Mcnghxvgs&amp;list&#x3D;UUSUMvVYDmzmyj2aTu0FXy8A</li>
    <li> My daughter just loved the assortment of colors.  It was exactly what she wanted and was looking for.</li>
    <li> The colors are great and the brush makes it easy to apply the polish to nails.</li>
    <li> I was so excited for these... But the brushes are too big to do most nail art and they seem really watery. Bummer</li>
    <li> This was the perfect gift for my 14 year old niece.  The set of polishes are neatly packed in a little plastic tray.  Its a great combination of colors - all very bright and vibrant.</li>
    <li> I had never really been into nails before but this kit makes it fun. It has all the colors I wanted. Doesn&#x27;t include any browns :( but that&#x27;s okay. It makes up for it with other fun colors. Good quality polish.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get any better for this price.  Great price.  Great colors.</li>
    <li> I got this set as a gift and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it! The colors are great and the glitter really stands out even with just one coat. The brushes are good for thin lines, but you can keep a little more polish on them for thick lines, too. The color variation is also one of my favorite things because I can do similar designs with different color combinations.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m in love :)</li>
    <li> Great selection of colors.  Four arrived dryish/gummy, we added acetone drop by drop and shook them up and they are usable, but this is a lot of work as it took a couple hours to get them to an acceptable state.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again but my daughter is thrilled with all the colors and as she normally spends three to five dollars a bottle at the store it was right in her price range without mom or dad having to kick any cash in.</li>
    <li> showed up on time and exactly as described.</li>
    <li> My friend loved it! The only qualm we found is that the yellow was too transparent, it didn&#x27;t show up enough. Besides that, though, I don&#x27;t think there was anything else that she didn&#x27;t like. Good price, great value, came timely, nice product.</li>
    <li> Awesome colors and work amazingly!!</li>
    <li> 4 of the polish were open and all over every thing. The colors were to thick to use. Dont wast your money. Color are to thin.</li>
    <li> Polish is great, but have a spare brush! The brushes enclosed a hofrible. If it wrent for thd brushes, I would have given a 5star. The brushes are so soft you can really appy the polish.</li>
    <li> Nail polish never dries. Its just pathetic.&lt;br /&gt;I hate it and will never gonna order it again.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely go for branded items.</li>
    <li> I love these! They work very well and I love all the different shades. I use them all the time</li>
    <li> It was a gift to my granddaughter.  According to her, it was terrific.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my niece and she went crazy for it!  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this as a gift for a girlie girl!</li>
    <li> The colors are amazing, came in great condition, love that there are glitter and gloss colors. I read some other reviews saying they had duplicates, and after going through mine i found some duplicates as well. turns out im missing #1, 5, and 20. i have an extra #3, 4, and 21. so thats a little disappointing to know theres colors i could have but dont. but overall, love them.</li>
    <li> These are great.  Colors are very bright.  was just what my daughters wanted. this kit is great. You get a lot of nail polish for one low price.</li>
    <li> Okay, so it doesn&#x27;t come with the nice black box as pictured. It is still a very nice set that comes shrink wrapped with the base and in my opinion that is good enough. Will make a great gift.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just a girl who loves painting her own nails and treating friends and family members with doing theirs.  This kit is so much fun.  It does NOT come in that fancy black box, but the little plastic tray they come in hold them just fine. Keep in mind that if you try to put the colors on a dark colored base, you need to put white down on top of the base so that your color turns out bright like the bottle :)</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast and ya there was no black box but i didnt buy it for the box. I know my wife will love them Thanks Shanny Cosmetics. The display case was real nice, will buy more stuff for my wife and other family. Thanks again</li>
    <li> I received this set as a gift. All of the colors are great but I am very disappointed with the white color. It is very thick and stringy out of the bottle. It looks like it has been opened before. I&#x27;m hoping the company will send me a new white. Otherwise, the brushes are really nice for doing french manicures or other designs and the colors are awesome!</li>
    <li> Very complete range of colours. I loved this pack very much. It is very recommendable for manicure or to share with friends!!</li>
    <li> So many colors to choose from. All bottles were full and just needed to be shaken. Brushes arent damaged at all.</li>
    <li> Ordered Tuesday recieved Friday afternoon. Recieved 24 different colors in a brand new setting. All the bottles were full and colors very vibrant. My only issue was a couple of the colors I tried had one long strand on the ends of the brushes that had to be clipped off with scissors for a nice smooth line.. No big deal really! I&#x27;ll definently be getting this again when I run out! :)</li>
    <li> the price for this is really cheap. It comes with 24 different color. The colors are beautiful and the brush applies it very smoothly on the nail.</li>
    <li> The only problem we had when the nail polish arrived was we had to get a pair of pliers to open two of the bottles.  Those two bottles had been over filled and dried after the top was put on.  Other than that everything else was fine and my daughter is happy with all finger nail stamping she can do now.</li>
    <li> Fantastic set of colors! I love doing my nails and this set is really really great for detailed nail art!</li>
    <li> Ordered these for my gf, she absolutely loves them. Great for designs she does on her nails. That&#x27;s about as far as I know.</li>
    <li> This kit of polishes offers all of the basic colors and shades that you could need in a nail art kit.</li>
    <li> This arrived very quickly and it comes in a pretty box. Perfect for a christmas or birthday gift for any girl.</li>
    <li> Not the best coverage, but acceptable for younger females and design instruction</li>
    <li> I just got these to play around with, but as soon as i opened them half of the bottles were goopy and stringy. On top of this the bristles are uneven and make nail art insanely difficult.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my nail obsessed little sister, and they are great! The brush inside is thin and precise, and the pigmentation on the polishes is great. You can&#x27;t beat the price for this many nail stripers, we normally see them in beauty supply stores for a dollar each and these ended up less than a dollar each. They arrived quickly and in nice organized packaging.</li>
    <li> Pretty colors but smells bad. The brushes are very small also</li>
    <li> I received the nail polish set today and #23 is missing! I tried to return but this item is not eligible to be returned. Not happy that I paid for this.</li>
    <li> My daughters and I like the nail art set. It has a verity of colors which is good. We also like it because the nail art stays one for more than a day.</li>
    <li> i wouldn&#x27;t suggest to buy this product to anyone. it dries up ? it a long way from china to my house.</li>
    <li> I totally recommend this set for the stripes and fun designs you want to do with your nails!!  My husband got this for me for Christmas and I love them!! :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for a christmas gift. Delivery was fast. Received all 24 colors. Quality of the nail polish is great. Price is great. Can&#x27;t wait to see my niece&#x27;s face when she receives this as a gift.</li>
    <li> The brush is very thin. It&#x27;s hard to paint the whole nail with this kind of brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my sister-in-law because she loves doing nails. When it was delivered I opened the box and I must say I want one for myself.  I cant wait till she opens her gift, she&#x27;s going to love it!!</li>
    <li> I would have given 5 stars, but all the bottles are not full.  They seem 1/2 to 2/4 full.  Not sure if it&#x27;s a used product, or if it was stored so long they evaporated.  Other than that the colors are fantastic, the brushes are very thin and long.  It&#x27;s a fabulous selection of colors, and sparkle polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great gift for self or anyone!!  Great value.  Polishes look beautiful when applied.</li>
    <li> Love these polishes.  Not only are the polishes great and long lasting, but the brushes are fine enough for detail, but also you can use them for your whole nail.</li>
    <li> I loved the packaging it come in. There were no leaks and the colors looked great. It also shipped quickly. I loved the variety of colors. A warning if you didn&#x27;t know is that these are detail nail polishes. This means that the brush is really thin and long. They are meant to make small details, not cover the nail. However, it&#x27;s pretty easy to use it as a normal brush. It is a little hard to make completely even coats. It also takes a little more time. I found that many of the brushes had uneven tips. A few strands stick out, which you can just cut. The polish isn&#x27;t thick so that wasn&#x27;t a problem. It spreads pretty well. Overall, I think that it is a good buy for the price and it gives you a good assortment for first time nail decorators.</li>
    <li> My set did not receive any doubles and came in a wonderful display case that looks great on my little arts &amp; crafts desk. I have used them to do a few different designs now and I am impressed by how nice and flexible the brushes are without being flimsy.</li>
    <li> The set is for nail art but most of the colors are somewhat transparent. I bought it for my kids and it worked very well for them.&lt;br /&gt;I received 2 #12 colors and no #11.</li>
    <li> Takes forever to dry. Forever. If you bump it on something an hour later, it will come off. Maybe I should be putting a top coat on over it to help with drying?&lt;br /&gt;Also the bottles are super cheap. I had just opened the box and dropped the white polish... was about a foot off the ground and it shattered... polish everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said.... maybe plan on putting a top coat on over it?</li>
    <li> I bought these as a gift for my sister and she loved them. So many colors to choose from and so many possibilities for different designs. Durable paint, lasts a long time on your nails and though the brushes are thin (meant for designs) you can just as well paint your nails in one solid color. I asked for her to share the wealth of color with me! :)</li>
    <li> This is a great set for those interested in trying their hand at nail art! I received it as a gift for my birthday and I am having a blast experimenting with the different colors. The thin brushes make for easy freehand striping, or use this polish with dotting tools/toothpicks to create fun designs. This polish works better for designs than regular polish because it&#x27;s a bit thicker (in a good way). Some of the colors are a bit more translucent and might need a couple coats (like the fluorescent yellow). The set includes solid colors and some glitter polishes so it really has a lot of variety.</li>
    <li> WOW! What a great product! I was so excited when I opened the box and saw all these beautiful colors. I am using the nail polish on a mission trip and I cannot wait to see all those little girls light up like sunshine when they see how beautiful their nails are. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited when i signed for this package and when i opened it up; bliss. I hate going to the beauty store and having to buy individual nail art polishes and spending a fortune and they never last. For an affordable price i received 24 different brilliant colors and shades along with glitters all at once.  Also, there were no spillages, cracks, damages, our repeat colors. Thank you SHANY cosmetics.</li>
    <li> bought this because i develop an obsession with nails now and i wanted to try to buy even thou some people didnt have the luck of me that they didnt repeat or send me a damage nail polish i can say all colors are here they are the same color as in the pictures. theres no colors missing and 24 nail polish were send perfectly thank you!! and i will be buying again soon!!</li>
    <li> My oldest niece is really into beauty and nail products, so I bought this for her as a gift.  We both LOVED the color assortment, but the quality of the polishes wasn&#x27;t great.  It was still a good value for a twelve year old, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it for myself.</li>
    <li> I love doing nail art, and after trying many different brands, these are the best and are a really good price too.  The colors are rich and beautiful, the brushes are easy to do intricate designs in, and it even comes with a really professional display set up.  So if you are looking for a great product for an even greater price, you should definitely purchase these!</li>
    <li> This seems like a great deal and the overall review rating convinced me to go ahead and order. The brushes are very thin which I could deal with but the polish has a cheap, thick, gummy consistency that takes forever to dry. I couldn&#x27;t get a coat on without it smudging so I was going to just take the hit on the return shipping and call this a loss. Oddly enough, you cannot return this product, something about safety reasons and hazardous material. Seems like a scam to me. I don&#x27;t know how this product has 4+ stars with 200+ reviews. Pay close attention to the one star reviews and don&#x27;t waste your time or money. Since I have to give this product at least a one star rating, that one star is for actually receiving 24 different colors and my five year old son thinking they&#x27;re pretty. Other than that, a complete nightmare to use as nail polish.</li>
    <li> Thought that these would be amazing; however, they are too watery. Besides the white and the black, the colors run. So if I try to do a design, a flower for example, it just becomes a blurred mess. Even lines aren&#x27;t that visible. Out of the entire 24 color, the white and black and glitters are the only ones worth using.</li>
    <li> they are beautiful colors and the bottles are bigger then i thought they would be for the price less then a dollar a bottle</li>
    <li> Amazing. Unblievable colours. More usefull with less cost. I will refer my friends to buy this colours set and also i am planning to buy two sets soon</li>
    <li> i would recommend this, i love it, wonderful variety of colors, im very happy and pleased, if your a nail polish junkie lie i am you will love this.</li>
    <li> These are incredibly good for nail art and specifically nail stamping with metal plates. You get a ton of variety and most of the colors are opaque / comparable to Konad Special Polish but for a much cheaper price. It is a different formula than their nail polishes. The metallics in here are extremely good -- going to pick up their other nail art polish set!</li>
    <li> A lot of the colors are really translucent, but it was a great deal!</li>
    <li> The product was as expected. Although i wish the polish was thicker but other then that works great. Love the different colors, and the price was perfect.</li>
    <li> I got two of these just for giggles for me and my neice. The regular polish stayed on my nails for just about 12 hours before it started peeling off. I removed it, started over, and did this twice more. Never did it last more than 12 hours. But the safety question comes with the glitter polish. That lasted longer. However, when I tried to remove it with standard polish remover, it would not come off! I kept at it, but the polish stayed put. So I just let it wear off normally - which took probably a week. Before I knew it, my nice nails were cracking, splitting, and peeling like onions. They peeled down below the skin. It was awful. I can&#x27;t say for sure that the glitter polish caused this, but I do think it&#x27;s highly unlikely that it&#x27;s all a coincidence.</li>
    <li> We bought this set for our teenage daughter for her birthday.  She LOVES it.  Her words-\\&quot;So COOL\\&quot;.  Every color, fabulous price!!  Art that she is allowed to draw and wear on herself. Super fast shipping too.  She wants this same set when she uses these all up.  THANK YOU!!</li>
    <li> i purchased these for a member of the family and she absolutely loved them. The colors included are awesome and it seems to be a good type of polish. It goes on smoothly. The only complaint is that the bristles on the painting brush seem to just fall off..</li>
    <li> This set was perfect for my daughter.  Lots of colors, love the thin brush on each one as she loves to do designs.  Although it was plastic, it has a case to keep them all in which was helpful when storing.  AWESOME!</li>
    <li> I received this set of 24 polishes as a gift for Christmas a couple of days ago. I had asked for it and was thrilled to get it! I&#x27;ve since used quite a few of the colors and have a good sense of how they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, mine was in a nice, branded box with a photo of what was inside. The polishes themselves are in a display-like plastic stand and shrink-wrapped. They didn&#x27;t move a centimeter in shipping, and all bottles in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors themselves aren&#x27;t too widely varied, just the basic colors you&#x27;d expect in a big set, but no dark green, just neon and glitter green. They are pretty thin in consistency, but the colors are vibrant and fun. I&#x27;ve used them to cover entire nails, and though they need a couple of coats to be totally opaque, definitely work for this purpose. They do, however, require a top coat or it will just pop right off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am super happy with this set of polishes, the only thing keeping me from 5 stars is the smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell like nail polish, it smells like paint. As in wall/house paint that comes in a big can. Pretty strongly, too. I just keep the bottle nearby, but not too close, though. I believe the difference in quality might be a seller-to-seller thing. Mine was purchased and fulfilled from Amazon, and maybe the 3rd party sellers don&#x27;t have the ability to keep their products in top condition, or might be wholesale/non-branded versions of this, which can end up being different or lower quality products.</li>
    <li> I received the Shany Cosmetics Nail Art Set for Christmas, and I love it! It has such a variety of colors, some glitter polish. The colors are so rich. If you are on the fence about this product, go for it! You wont be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Seemed to get sticky on the brush making it hard to use.</li>
    <li> Bought this set for my wife and it arrived on time and the colors are nice and bright. Only thing is two of the nail polish bottles had leaked and that was no big deal my wife wiped them off and problem solved but there was one bottle that was half empty and when she opened it it was all dried up its like someone put a half used bottle of nail polish in there with the rest of them. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this purchase I think the nail set my wife got was a display or used and I bought a brand new set.</li>
    <li> This are bright colors and the quality is OK but is rather thick.  It should be noted that the brush for these polishes is very small and good for doing details.</li>
    <li> Great gift for my granddaughter&#x27;s sixteenth birthday</li>
    <li> My wife loved this set, she liked all the colors and said it dries real fast and goes on and on about how her toe nails lasted for a month....win.</li>
    <li> I love the variety of colors, and the colors are vibrant, NOT DULL AT ALL.</li>
    <li> great colors for nail art</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 13 year old daughter. She loves them, and so do all her friends! The colors are great, no duplicates. We spent some time choosing between the brands on Amazon, but we decided to go with Shany because they were slightly cheaper, and I am glad we did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never consider myself s nail art person, since the only time I&#x27;ve tried it I made a huge mess. I won this set as part of a prize package from Amazon though, so I decided to give it a try. I love this set! The brushes are really easy to work with and the colors are great.</li>
    <li> I love this nail art set.  The colors are perfect - there is something for everyone.  The polish goes on perfectly with one coat so when doing designs you don&#x27;t have to worry.  I just love the length of the brush on each of them and the amount of polish included in each bottle is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so very happy I choose this set.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I got these!!! They make doing nail designs so much easier!!!! I cant wait to get the rest of the nail supplies that I ordered!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the brilliant colors and am very pleased with the product.  I am a professional nail tech and have used the product 5 times since receiving, have had excellent results each time.  The &#x27;yellow-green&#x27; that is a hard color to use shows beautifully on white and black polish!  I do acrylics and designs on myself and found that the brushes are easy to use and there is very little to no &#x27;dripping&#x27;.  Very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Nice colors. Dry fast. I love it!</li>
    <li> These colors jump from the nail. My first use was writing on a nail and it was so easy. I have no cons at all, so far.</li>
    <li> I love it (: Cute ,Beautiful colors!</li>
    <li> when I got these the orange was broken so I was already down on color. Dry out very fast. Although it is only about $1 a color not worth the money or the wait time. Also half of them the brush is frayed.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful I do a lot of nail art so I&#x27;ve tried lots of different brands of nail art strippers and these are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used love them!!!!!</li>
    <li> The brush is super thin and the worst part is the nail polish completely peels off after a few days. Will never buy again.</li>
    <li> Loved the selection of colors, but some were a bit too thick as if they were kind of old. Over all pleased with the selection of colors for the price.</li>
    <li> I like the variety of colors in this nail polish set, and would have given it more than 3 stars.  What is preventing me from giving it a higher rating, is that 4 of the bottles were open and spilled.  This happened with color 7 (red), color 9 (white) color 15 (glitter green) and color 18 (light blue).  I am disappointed, seeing as 4 of the colors are mostly gone from their spills.  I don&#x27;t think this is a case of them breaking during shipment, seeing as the bottles were not broken, just open.  The 4 bottles had their brushes resting in the bottle, but they had not been screwed onto the bottle to close it.  So they spilled.  I am disappointed about this!  On the positive side, the other colors are great and I have already made a really pretty manicure!  They also work well with nail stamping plates too.  Also, the small brush is great for creating nail art designs!  :)</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this.  But, boy was I disappointed.  Received 2 colors that had 3 each of same  and 4 colors that were double.  So all in all shorted 8 diff. colors. Sent back for refund.</li>
    <li> These polishes work well with the Bundle Monster plates!  I was surprised that the brush for each bottle is a striper brush, albeit difficult to work with.  I chalk that up to a learning curve because the striper does seem like it would be supple were it not already in polish.  The display is sturdy, attractive and useful.  The deep pigment of the bright colors are impressive.  The polish itself is a breeze to work with and dries very fast on its own.  Remember that feeling you got when you were Kindergaten age and you were given your first box of 24 color box of crayons instead of the normal 8 pack?  Take that memory x10.  These colors are so BRIGHT, and the variations of different colors with just the right glitter in the glitter options.  An amazing set of polishes for a great price for nail art.  You&#x27;ll use these up before they get goopy since each cylindrical bottle is about half the normal size bottle.  It makes up for it with variety, quality, versatility and price.  Can&#x27;t wait to receive the image stamping plates I ordered from them as well.  Looks like some good, original, not overdone images coming my way.  Maybe this will be the company to be brave enough to break away from the repitition of flowers, butterflies, hearts, and simple geometrics on image plates.  GO SHANY!  BREAK THE RULES!!!!?  Luv ya and can&#x27;t wait to review your products that I ordered for my Nail-n-Beauty YouTube channel.  I&#x27;ll be honest so don&#x27;t mess up with future products!  :)</li>
    <li> Best deal ever! It was amazing in quality, and a great color range. I would recommend this to anyone who loves nail art!</li>
    <li> Shany Nail Art set is Really a great Product for best price. I love it and its really nicely made.</li>
    <li> Today we used the Shaney nail paint collection for a shoot and we were very happy with it. The color we used went on smoothly and was shiny and pigmented once dried. As you can see in my uploaded image, the nails look great as does the models face, which is 100% Shaney product. The models that have used the Shaney products I have have had nothing bad to say about them.</li>
    <li> i am happy with the quality and selection for such a good price!!! i will be purchasing more products from you. Thanks</li>
    <li> These smell AWFUL! Worse than any nail polish smells, and I&#x27;ve been doing nails for 20 plus years.  But the colors are pretty and if you can get past the smell, totally great price.</li>
    <li> With all these hot colors you&#x27;ll be a Trendsetter! The bright colors are high quality, quick dry &amp; chip resistant and high end brush create with style. You&#x27;ll have endless possibilities to create beautiful art for your nails! Color YOUR world with all these great colors!</li>
    <li> The colors are very nice and go along well with any other colors. The only con about this product is that the tops are hard to grip at times, causing random marks on the nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for great polish and colors to work on my nails. A nail artist must have are these nail art brush. I got this as a gift from my uncle for Christmas after he saw them on my amazon wish list. They ship in a lovely plastic package and in a nice cardboard box. The colors are vibrant and bright, and (for me) none of them shipped broken. I can&#x27;t wait to start using these in my weekly manicures, and I can&#x27;t wait to use them in nail school.</li>
    <li> didnt get much of a response from these colors as i did the kleancolor retro set.  i know they are pretty, nothing else</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter loved stocking her nail polish rack with an assortment of colors. They were also packed well and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> love the different colors! the brush is not what i use to do nail art though. its good if youre just drawing \\&quot;lines\\&quot; but for shapes and more detail, i suggest you get special nail brushes. i have the shany nail brush set and they are perfect for these! well worth the money and these seem to dry quicker than the regular shany nail polish sets they make for actual nail polish not nail art. they set nicely on your nail and you only need just a little bit to do great nail art. no need to glob or do extra coats/detailing over your original work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would recommend to anyone from novice/n00b to professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- jill</li>
    <li> These have a lot ot colors to choose from and they work great for designs. They were easy to use.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on a Monday and got it that Tuesday! I am super happy with the delivery. It was packaged perfectly and intacted. No bottles were broken or spilling. I read other reveiws before I ordered this product and saw that some packages had doubles in it so I was a little worried about it, but I when received it there wasn&#x27;t a double in sight. I haven&#x27;t been able to use them yet becuase my nails are already painted, but the colores look nice and bright. Overall I&#x27;m a happy customers.</li>
    <li> nail polish received was quite old and goopey, I will not purchase again</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this is more for additions to nails, like flowers etc. as the brush is very skinny compared to the normal nail polishes. That should be better described. Otherwise, it&#x27;s good quality and came in the mail very fast.</li>
    <li> Got it for my daughter and she has been able to do many different designs them</li>
    <li> I love all the colors! The brushes are really thin and tiny..I guess for doing decorative nails...I use it for all over and it works...u just have to figure out how to use the tiny brush...well worth the money! I&#x27;ll buy another set with other colors if I can find for that price!</li>
    <li> This was a wonderful set! It comes in a nice plastic display and it is packed carefully. Gold glitter and silver glitter color polishes are included. It has some cool fluorescent colors as well. They are fine tip brushes to make designs with, like flowers, but if you have the patience, you could paint your whole nail as well! But this polish is very quick drying, so you would have to be fast! BTW, quick drying is a good thing. When I received my package, it did not have any spills, except the green polish bottle had some dried green polish outside of the cap, but it wasn&#x27;t much! It definitely didn&#x27;t look like it spilled, maybe just a small packaging mishap. All the nail polish bottles were fine, tightly capped and well packaged. The set includes one white polish for traditional French tip.</li>
    <li> the nail colors are all nice, bright, and well to work with.....the brushes are small enough for you to create your own designs.....make sure you always keep top clean and that you shake well so you don&#x27;t end up with thick, nail polish</li>
    <li> I love this set! It&#x27;s very cheap but the colors are amazing. Even the quality is.</li>
    <li> Shipped very quickly. Faster that expected. Item was great. A few of the colors needed to be mixed but all were intacked and all colors were wet not dry. No issues with any of the items!!</li>
    <li> The brushes are nice and thin, the colors are as vivid as they seem!  Some of the brushes had a lingering long hair straggling out of the bottom of the brush that I didn&#x27;t discover until I used it.  That was really annoying, since it left a long super thin line on my art.  But once you know to look for it, you can fix before you use.  The white is a little too transparent for me, but most are opaque.  Anyone could just purchase some nice nail art brushes, use regular polish, and clean in-between uses, but I like having these already available with less cleanup time to put into my manicures.  Worth the price for sure, comes in a nice sturdy box for storage.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Bough these for my dtr n She loves all the colors. Good price for all the nail polishes you recieve.</li>
    <li> These nail polish work nice for doing nail art.  The brush are thin and not suited for painting your entire nails.  I use them to paint the nail plates and that&#x27;s all that it is good for since I&#x27;m not an artist to do nail art.  I have lots of fun with doing nails with my 4 year old.  But nothing I would in public although she could get away with it. They are decent sized and seem to be of good quality.  I would recommend if you are doing nail art.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter, 12, has been doing nails for a while, and has always had trouble finding small brushes to draw designs on with. The brushes for these polishes are a perfect fine tip, and the colors can&#x27;t be found anywhere else.LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I received all 24 colors, packaged tightly in a display too. These colors are sweet! I LOVE the neon ones and wish there was a kit with just these by Shany. I also ordered a pack of their nail brushes and i love those as well. I will buy from Shany again.</li>
    <li> Very watery, brushes too thin, overall just a cheap product. I&#x27;m not happy with Shany.</li>
    <li> We bought these as a gift and they were awesome! You get so many great colors and they work great with stampers.</li>
    <li> Polish was lumpy and thick terrible for designs</li>
    <li> Love the vibrant colors and the box/packaging makes it easy for storage and organization.  I really likes the colors with sparkle.</li>
    <li> Comes with great assortment of colors and the packaging was perfect. Nothing was spilled or tipped over. The brushes seem great and the color comes out nice</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like the polish, the quality of color is not good, it is very hard to see the colors. will not recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> The polish dries fairly quickly and actually last awhile.</li>
    <li> I was really interested in designing my own nails so thought this would be the perfect starter kit.  I was wrong about this.  One of the colors was totally dried out because the cover wasn&#x27;t on tight.  Over half of them are so clear that you would need more than 3 coats to make it so you can see it over another color.  Also, I painted my nails last night and it is already chipping today.  I am very disappointed in this purchase and won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I regularly do nail art, and am regretting this purchase. When I look for striper brushes I generally am wanting something that has a thicker base so that one swipe will do the design. These polishes are thin and would require multiple swipes to get any kind of coverage.</li>
    <li> my mom gave this to me for Christmas and i loved it!!! It dries relatively quickly and not only are the colors really pretty, they are all true to color. There is one annoying thing, there is a couple of strands on the brush that spring up, but besides that I totally recommend this product. I love this product and look forward to the nail designs i&#x27;ll be making for the year to come!</li>
    <li> What an incredible bargain!!! The colors are beautiful and they are full size stripers. I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Love all the colors. Great deal! Brush is pointed and makes it easy to apply.  Would like to see more pearl colors.</li>
    <li> I received the Shany Nail Art Set (24 colors) as a gift this Christmas! Wow! The vibrant colors, consistency of polish, and the narrow -perfect size of brush enables even non-professionals the ability to create beautiful designs and nail art! I have been changing the design often, with all the colors and ease of designing, I just love experimenting with new looks! I use in conjuction with the Shany Nail Polish Set and find the design possibilities are endless. I paint my family and friends nails and when people (men too) notice my unique nails they always ask where I get them done, I  always say \\&quot;Shany Nail Art Set\\&quot;, it allows anyone to paint and design nail art themselves! Thank you so much! I love the Shany Nail Art Set an the Shany Nail Polish Set!</li>
    <li> I love this nail art set! Nice colors, 24 different, no repeat colors. I ordered this when Amazon was selling it... I like to order most of my purchases directly from Amazon since I am an Amazon Prime customer. Plus directly from Amazon has several assurances that I like and they usually package their products best. The set came in a plastic, individually set up tray so no polishes were broken or leaking. The quality of the polish is very good; I only use one coat, sometimes two but rarely. The brush is skinny enough to draw with and thick enough to make decent sized lines. Some of the brushes have longer strands that look like they weren&#x27;t cut correctly and will sometimes mess up the design I&#x27;m trying to accomplish, but I just cut them correctly and it solves the problem. Great purchase, I recommend this set.</li>
    <li> i really thought hte brushes would be thinner to do designs with but they werent so i had to order other brushes, but i love the colors</li>
    <li> My wife and dauter love this you can make so many designs with them it comes in a nice case and looks great</li>
    <li> Absolutely HORRIBLE applicator brushes!!! So thin and long they are impossible to use.  Do not waste your money on these.</li>
    <li> These are quite thick. Adding a few drops of acetone helped out. But the quality is only as good as the price, as most things are. The tips are not quite thin enough making it hard to do fine lines. The pigment is not very dark either. Would I buy these again? Likely not.</li>
    <li> The colors I&#x27;ve used so far seem to be a little watery. Takes a few coats to get the color to stand out. But not too bad for the price. Haven&#x27;t used all the colors yet.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and received it very quickly. The colors are very nice and its a great variety. Plus i love the sparkle colors. They are perfect for nail art because of the thin brushes. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> excellent colors, great product, price! thank you!</li>
    <li> My nieces are so excited to have more possibilities for their nails</li>
    <li> These Nail Art Polishes are Great They are Thick and are good to use with the XXL Shany Nail Art Plates</li>
    <li> I am becoming quite a fan of Shany.  Great quality.  Purchased for my daughter and couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;It is nice to give a high quality gift at a good price.</li>
    <li> beyond happy with this purchase!! i love all the colors, each one came unopened and not broken! i use them every time i paint my nails and toes :)</li>
    <li> I have recently gotten into nail art as a hobby. I received a single bottle of the black polish from a friend a really liked the quality of the polish as well as the thin brush. I have been able to create more intricate designs and do not feel as if I am wasting polish like I did using the paint brush/regular polish method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering the other set of colors.</li>
    <li> Great present for my friend, great variety of colors, for the perfect price! She is very impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves them!  Wish I had orderd more of them as this is a really nice set with every color you could possibly need to do nail art with and make a great gift!</li>
    <li> Such a nice set. They came in a nice box and all so organized.  I love the neon colors too! Only thing I noticed was a polish smell so I thought one had broken or was opened but I checked and all were fine.</li>
    <li> I got a great deal on these. They were offered via a lightening deal. Just what I was looking for to get my nieces for Christmas. there are a ton of colors and the fine tips will help them make the cool designs the girls like. Nicely packaged as well. Couldn&#x27;t believe my luck with these!</li>
    <li> first thing i noticed when I opened my package was the smell of bubble gum!  So much nicer that polish smell.  I recently did my little girls nails..i did lady bugs..and very easy to apply, made dots not smudge, very well worth the low price</li>
    <li> Fair value for the price.  Works well as a gift item.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Great colors!</li>
    <li> I love the vibrant colors however they chip off easily</li>
    <li> My daughter is ready to do some really serious nail art now. Love the colors.  Happy happy happy! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Loved my Shany Nail Art!!!! I Would definitely buy another set of Shany nail art to have to replace my old set!</li>
    <li> My daughter has had so much fun with this set.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to getting this huge range of nail varnish colours and thought it was a great price for what I was getting, but after using them I&#x27;m really disappointed - they&#x27;re just awful. Firstly, the brushes are tiny and this makes it difficult to cover your whole nail in a few simply strokes - instead, you have to go over and over your nail to coat it, and a film quickly starts to form on the top of the polish while you&#x27;re doing this so it is hard to get a clean finish. Secondly, the colours take FOREVER to dry - I have left them for upwards of thirty minutes, and then taking them to be dry, still messed them up by going about my day. Thirdly, I have only tried a couple of the colours thus far, but the solid colours don&#x27;t dry to a nice sheen, instead they dry to a dull, grainy-looking finish... the kind of look you get when your polish is getting a bit old, or you&#x27;ve cleaned the bathroom in it! Really, spend your money buying one or two good quality polishes, because these just really are not worth it.</li>
    <li> Love them. Great colors. So perfect for adding designs to your nails. Nice packaging and product. Will buy again  thanks!</li>
    <li> I really like the colors!  They are AWESOME!!!!  You will  need a good basecoat under these colors.  I recommend an acetone remover for cleaning the darker shades from your nails.  You will also need nail polish thinner as these polishes tend to be a bit thick!  But still a good buy so I thought...  Have fun with this stuff. Oh and get some extra brushes so that you can work the designs....</li>
    <li> Got my SHANY NAIL ART SET ON TIME, IM SO HAPPY WITH IT, THANK YOU. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Love it! Shipping was fast and product is great!</li>
    <li> One bottle had leaked a little, but still usable. Every color is unique; no duplicates. The brushes are very slim, which would probably work great for designs, but makes it difficult to coat the entire nail and have a smooth finish. The polish seems thicker than more expensive brands. I use Orly products for base and top coats, so it smooths the polish and helps it wear longer. I got this kit for my toenails so I could easily complement the Red Carpet Manicure gel colors I use on my fingernails. The Shany colors remove easily with pure acetone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if I had paid more than a buck a bottle, I would be disappointed. I think this would be ideal for kids or for someone painting designs.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen the kit in person, but my granddaughter claims to love it, so that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> peels right off nails doesn&#x27;t work very well. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying if you want good quality nail art polish. Good variety of colors...drys to quickly when trying to do a design</li>
    <li> The package was received quickly and packaged thoroughly, so that none of the polishes could get damaged.  The colors are nice and the brush tips perfect for nail art.</li>
    <li> My daughter is really into nail design so she likes to play with the different colors. They are small enough for nail design.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my 15 yr old daughter who has become a nail art fanatic! The brushes are thin and easy to paint with...fair quality nail polish. She is in heaven with all the colors.</li>
    <li> I could not wate to get these there great to add extra flair to any nail design and there is all different colors and they were well packed im so happy the long brush make it easy to make little designs even on a small toe nail the boxes they come in keep them nice and neat onec again I love them</li>
    <li> I chose a five star rating because this set really stunned me. It has the cutest colors! There are plenty colors to choose from. The packaged arrive quickly. It was packaged neatly and sturdy. No broken bottles, a nice try to keep all the little bottles neat. I don&#x27;t want to share my polish but I would definitely recommend this product from SHANY Cosmetics. It is well worth it!</li>
    <li> I DIDN&#x60;T REALLY LIKE THE SHANY Nail Art Set (24 Famouse Colors Nail Art Polish, Nail Art Decoration)... THANKS ITS REALLY SMILE BAD IT MADE ME SICK</li>
    <li> When I first became interested in nail art I went to my local Sally Beauty. They had liner polishes but (1) the selection was skimpy, (2) the polishes weren&#x27;t great quality and (3) they were expensive (even on a buy 2 get 1 free. This set is a bargain with 24 polishes for $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is great, allowing you to store the polishes in a minimum of space and still see all the colors. However unlike the photo above my polish set came in a clear box and thus there were no color swatches to &amp;#34;preview&amp;#34; the polishes with. Other people noted problems with duplicate colors and/or partial bottles but my set is perfect and was exceptionally well packed, first in its own container, next in a form fitting heavy corrugated box and then in the Amazon packing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polishes themselves are high quality and the included brushes work really well. I use a Sally Hansen 60 second dry diamond top coat and the nail art lasts over a week before it even thinks of chipping and by then my nails have grown enough for there to be a visible gap at the cuticle end and so it&#x27;s time to re-polish (and redesign) anyway.</li>
    <li> All the colors are very pretty!!!! And normally when you buy cheap strippers for nail art the colors come of sheer and your nail art looks faded but these go on perfect you can see your nail art!! Great for on the budget nail techs and beginners!!!</li>
    <li> You should try it now! The brush inside is very convenient to do the best designs! You can do anything with it!</li>
    <li> Shipping was super quick, product was just as described and the colors are awesome and they do an awesome job. Really worth the money and such a bargain compared to buying individual bottles just to get the colors you want. Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> First of all I was sent regular nail polish with normal brushes instead of the pinpoint nail art brushes. Second, after just a couple of uses the nail polish starts to goop up and gets too thick to be brushed smoothly onto your nails. Nail polish also starts chipping after a day or two even when used with a base coat and top coat. I would have given just one star but some of the colors are really pretty.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nail art fanatic- I do my own nail art EVERYTIME I do my nails... The color spectrum was pretty good... My only concern was the inconsistency of the brush quality... Some were fine and some had loose &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; that caused inconsistent lines- especially fine lines. Other than that it would&#x27;ve received a five star</li>
    <li> I love this line of cosmetics already, and now purchasing this Nail Art set has completed my life. These colors are so vibrant and high quality, you don&#x27;t nee two coats, they glide easy and what more can you ask from 24 colors at such inexpensive price!  They are beautiful, and also come with its own standing caddy. So you can display or storage your colors!</li>
    <li> My grandaughter loved this. You get a great amount for your moneyand great variety of colors. A great Value Ladies</li>
    <li> Fantastic for nail art and designs! Absolutely worth buying, it comes with every color you could possibly need for any nail art you want to do.</li>
    <li> These are awesome! Good color combo...skinny brush is great for decorations over solid colors. I always get compliments when I use these.and it was super affordable:)</li>
    <li> I just received my polishes. The colors are so beautiful. I&#x27;m starting my business, and this is the perfect addition to my polishes.  It adds a great variety of beautiful colors for my clients to choose from:))</li>
    <li> Very good quality, nice bundle .</li>
    <li> Love all the colors. I do my own nail art sometimes because the nail salons don&#x27;t have an imagination. LOL I&#x27;ve been using these for almost a year and they are still good. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I love how this is  set of metallic and neon colors! Now I don&#x27;t have to buy nail polish separately. This is very easy to apply. You may want to have a 2nd or 3rd coat but it&#x27;s okay with me. Really don&#x27;t have any problems with these nail polishes.</li>
    <li> Was given as a gift.  She loved it!</li>
    <li> So the polish itself is really nice. I love all the colors that this set comes with. What sucks, are the actual brushes. They are not made well at all and makes it really hard to use these to draw designs on your nails. So for that reason. I have actually only used these a few times. Sucks though, because the colors are really nice.</li>
    <li> This one is very worst product which I have taken on mother&#x27;s day. My mom was not at all happy after using it, when compare to the cost its not a worthfull product. Please don&#x27;t take risk to all the viewers.</li>
    <li> All came in and all were great.</li>
    <li> My 14 year old loves these.</li>
    <li> bought this second set for a friend, great value</li>
    <li> Bought for my oldest daughter. Quality of paint ehhhh - chips and peels easily. That said we got a wide range of colors (no repeats) and my daughter (11) is happy - so not a loss but not nail polish I would buy for myself either.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price</li>
    <li> Great gift idea! It came in really nice packaging for wrapping up and so many beautiful colors!!!!!!</li>
    <li> So hard to find good stripers around where I live so I ordered these and they are great so far. There are a couple that aren&#x27;t very opaque which means going over the lines more than once which is difficult to keep even but, it only seems to be a couple of the lighter colors. It was packaged nicely and comes with it&#x27;s own stand so to speak. It&#x27;s just plastic but it keeps them orderly.</li>
    <li> These are awesome! The colors are very vibrant and beautiful! I love the variety in this set, also very good deal, 24 for $20! Not bad quality either! I love how they have a few metallics, a few glitter, and neons! I highly recommend this set!</li>
    <li> This Nail Art set comes with all the colors of the rainbow and more! with neon colors, sparkly colors and matte colors, this set comes with a beautiful variety! The brush tips are so small that you can draw and make lots of art and designs on your nails. You can also just paint your nail, but it takes a little bit longer with the thin tip. Worth it and good quality. If you are a nail art lover then I recommend this! I also really love that the nail polish is very bright and bold. So many colors! I absolutely LOVE this set!</li>
    <li> Was not impressed with the brushes that come in the bottles. I can&#x27;t do the nail art I&#x27;d like to because they are too thick. I would much rather purchase one&#x27;s from Sally&#x27;s. (which is what I&#x27;ve started to do).. Also, didn&#x27;t get the full 24 colors.. Got duplicate of the same..</li>
    <li> I love this product and I will definitly be ordering more Shany Cosmetics products! The brushes are thin, but it lets you paint your&#x27; nails without getting it on the edges of your&#x27; fingers, it also makes it so you can easily create your&#x27; own designs! The 24 colors are perfect, the only thing is that it doesn&#x27; include a brown. The small desplay case is nice looking when it&#x27;s on a desk or shelf and I would order this as a gift for friends and family members. The polish drys fast and the shipping was incredibly fast! I got mine the next business day and I live in Maine. &lt;3</li>
    <li> Great for my girl 9 years old</li>
    <li> A great. Affordable set! We paid 19.99 prime shipping.&lt;br /&gt;All in good condition, none dried out.</li>
    <li> The color range is decent. The problem is a lot of the brushes are defective. They lose hairs a lot (which is somewhat normal for a new brush, but not this much), the consistency of the paint is off as well (some are runny and others are as thick as can be) but the worst part was the black brush was curved. So it can not be used as a fine tip brush. I will have to send this back and get another kit and just hope that it&#x27;s not curved as well. Other than that the colors are vibrant and it lays well once you get the hang of the consistency. And the colors don&#x27;t chip easily either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say buy it and take your chance.</li>
    <li> This set comes with 24 colors and are perfect for creating the perfect nails for any holiday! Hope you have fun!</li>
    <li> The Shany Nail Art set is wonderful!  There are so many bottles, I&#x27;m splitting it in two for my two grand-daughters for Christmas.  They will love it!  Very well packed.  Great price!</li>
    <li> Very Nice Product, Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is extremely easy to work with, we started doing our own nail art and this set makes professional results even for me with no training I just watched videos online</li>
    <li> Takes a while to receive</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, my granddaughter is gonna love em!</li>
    <li> Great colors and keeps tray keeps them all organized.</li>
    <li> I love this set, and the colors are beautiful!</li>
    <li> First of all I think the quality of this paint is very good. I just tried it on myself and the colors are true and solid. They also dry very fast. I ordered these specifically for nail art. The brush is very precise. I am a professional nail tech for 8 years and have gone through a lot of other products. Shany, so far, is one of the best. I got all of the colors you are supposed to get. None of them were opened and none of them are dried out or thick. Thank you for a quick delivery.</li>
    <li> got it for my neice. She loves the color selection and uses them all of the time.</li>
    <li> love it love it love it love it they work really good!! i can do so many designs its just great</li>
    <li> IT DOESNT WORK IT FALLS OFF IN WATER AND THEY WILL NOT TO REFUNDS BECAUSE THEY CONSIDER IT HAZARDOUS MATERIAL</li>
    <li> Dont like this product. it is smelling very badly and not shining. I don&#x27;t suggest this for any one. Thanks</li>
    <li> This is great for those who are addicted to nail polish and such a steal for so many colors. Buy it today and find a new favorite brand and color.</li>
    <li> there are so many bright vibrant neon colors so choose from it came in perfect packaging and all of the colors are so different. I love how different every color is but it is so hard to choose which color i would want to wear most, so i wear them all!! It is my favourite nail polish I have ever had!</li>
    <li> The colors are gorgeous, however a lot of the brushes are terrible. Not good quality. They don&#x27;t stay straight and they tend to go in a bunch of directions.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great product.  I bought this for my fourteen year old niece for Christmas and of course I had to try it out, then I tried another one, and another one and another one.  So much fun!  I even contemplated keeping a few for myself!</li>
    <li> This set is beautiful! Great for women who love to paint detailed designs on their nails. So many colors to choose from!</li>
    <li> These nail polishes work great! I like to change my nail polish a lot and this looked like an interesting set. The brush is skinny that it can be used for intricate detail or you can paint your whole nail that color. The colors are vibrant and the polish shines.</li>
    <li> I was worried I would receive a gooey pile of polish after reading some of the other reviews but these polishes came perfectly fine on a tray inside a neat little box. The colors are very pretty and work well. My only complaint is that the colors that came are not the ones shown in the picture. I would have liked them to be because I wanted a lot of different colors like the yellow and light blue. I guess you get a mixed bag so they should mention that. A lot of similar colors but I am happy because the polishes are easy to use and create gorgeous nail art!</li>
    <li> The metallic polishes aren&#x27;t intense enough to use to decorate unless all you want is a bit of glimmer. The rest of the polishes work wonderfully for nail art.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product.  I have been searching everywhere for skinny art nail polish and this is definitely the place to come.  There are so many different colors and it&#x27;s a decent price!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter...she is always painting her nails!!! We were very happy with the purchase. I need to order some for myself now. Without a doubt I would recommend this product to my friends and family. Cant wait until her Birthday and next Christmas to order her more!</li>
    <li> Brushes fell off on some abd nail Polish was all over the outside of 3-4 of them. Like they had already been used.</li>
    <li> Bought this set of polish for my ten year old grandaughter. She loved it and was amazed by the assortment. We have had a great time using this set and would order again.</li>
    <li> Overall, this set is not bad. It&#x27;s a good value for the money. My daughter had fun with them. I would likely purchase them again, but this set is a 3-star product.&lt;br /&gt;Some notes:&lt;br /&gt;1) There was a very strong, distinct &amp;#34;nail polish&amp;#34; chemical smell from these polishes before even taking them out of the box (in which they were also shrink-wrapped.) This is the strongest-smelling nail polish I have ever smelled, and I used to be a nail tech. Use in a well-ventillated area.&lt;br /&gt;2) These are NAIL ART paints. They cannot be used as a base coat with nail art on top. The chemicals in the paints make them bleed together. You MUST use a different base coat. These polishes, however, can be used by themselves as a base coat as long as you do not plan to use the same paints for art on top. This disappointed my daughter. Perhaps a way around this would be to place a clear top coat between the base coat and the nail art coat.&lt;br /&gt;3) The box looks generic, and it does not close all of the way. The box arrived bent because of this. Beware if purchasing as a gift.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and bright colors, flows with ease, and fast shipment. Came as shown</li>
    <li> This came very neatly packaged. No bottles were opened or spilled. The colors are brilliant, my daughter will love it for Christmas.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my younger sister. She loved it and seeing how much she loved i want to get one for my self</li>
    <li> Colors are very vibrant and brushes are strong. Great variety of colors and great price. Great glitter colors included too - very happy with purchase :)</li>
    <li> More than expected love</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with all the colors it comes with. these are truly very good quality! Little over 1$ a polish nail art bottle is not that bad. Very pigmented color and I would highly recommend! :)</li>
    <li> The first thing that I have to say is that.. I loved the colors of the nail polishes! They last a long time and the color doesn&#x27;t chip! Easy to apply, perfect for a gift! :)</li>
    <li> What a great deal on TWENTY FOUR polishes. Wow. And also, the brush is great for creating fun designs, in my opinion. I love how there are sooo many colors, too! It&#x27;s great if you love switching up your colors, or if you just like a good variety.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product. It is a set of striping polishes but can easily be used to paint your entire nail. What I have done is take a full size brush from an old or used up polish, clean it and use it to paint my entire nail. You can also use the striping brush, it just takes a little longer. The colors are beautiful and there is a nice assortment. I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Love the color variety!</li>
    <li> Used product and I gave it as a Christmas gift!!! Not happy---refund.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set as a Christmas gift for my tweenage niece, she is obsessed with nail polish and nail art. She went crazy, she LOVED this gift, she has been using it since she got it and has nothing for fabulous things to say about it. She is very particular about her nail polish, she said the polish was great and the colors were opaque, so I will give this a 5 out of 5! Best bang for your buck. Great set.</li>
    <li> Best friend got this for me for my birthday and absolutely love it!!! Colors are bright, and quality ain&#x27;t bad!!</li>
    <li> I have been interested in nail and makeup products and just discovered Shany nail and cosmetics products. The quality of the product is excellent and the colors are all unique and cool. It is a really good product with no clumping or color separation. I will for sure buy more Shany products. This is a really good buy and I would defiantly recommend it to other people.</li>
    <li> doesnt dry fast enough. Also very squishy after drying. The brushes also have one hair at the tip that always gets in the way. may be good for light nail art but nothing too detailed.</li>
    <li> I received my nail polish today. I was a little nervous because other viewers mentioned when they received their polish in the mail their polish was leaking in the box. However, all mine were in the box neatly and all lids were closed tightly. The nail polish was perfect. It wasn&#x27;t dried up. I am very excited to use it. Can&#x27;t wait to make designs.Very happy with my choice. I would buy these again and would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> LOTS OF COOL COLORS AND EASY TO USE TO MAKE AWESOME DESIGNS ON YOUR FINGERNAILS. YOU NEED A LARGER BRUSH TO PAINT THE WHOLE NAIL THOUGH.</li>
    <li> What a great deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i really love the variety of colors and the metallic paints look really sparkly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a GOOD BUY!</li>
    <li> Great variety of consistent texture nail polishes. Thin brush accommodates drawing of lines and other art on nails. One idea: Polished all nails with&lt;br /&gt;metallic deep. but not dark, blue. On one nail on each hand, &amp;#34;drew&amp;#34; a red star, then &amp;#34;drew&amp;#34; 3 silver curved lines from the star--makes a shooting star. Lots of fun to do and wear.</li>
    <li> Great buy, I just moved and somehow my nail art polish has disappeared so I am rebuilding my collection and these colors are out standing...they arrived on time. Will definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> Purchased this set for our Goddaughter for her 13th birthday.  She loved it!  There are so many colors, I kind of want a set for myself!</li>
    <li> this order came very fast, its for my daughter for Christmas, i know she will love it.</li>
    <li> works as adverised. a fun gift.</li>
    <li> I love a good value - 24 full-sized nail polishes for $25.00.  I placed my order on Wednesday and received the product on Friday!!&lt;br /&gt;A variety of fun colors for my granddaughter - she&#x27;s going to love this gift!!  Great price - great product!  Please send a link&lt;br /&gt;to this review to Reviews@ShanyCosmetics.com so they receive this feedback.</li>
    <li> Another great collection of colors to use for nail art.</li>
    <li> lots of fun colors! arrived quickly. love the options of all the colors. I would recommend this product. colors go on nicely!</li>
    <li> I purchased this nail art set to try out nail design for fun, and am so very pleased with this purchase.  This is definitely not the same as plain nail polish, it goes on much more smoothly, and dries quickly.  Excellent value and variety of colors.</li>
    <li> Great for accents and designs.  I use in conjuction with a nail art book to create my own.  Great price.</li>
    <li> I wanted a set with a lot of colors, and this fit the bill.  Unfortunately, the brushes are very small/thin, which makes it difficult to apply the polish evenly.  Before I could even finish a nail, it would start to dry and become goopy.  All this could be avoided if the brushes were just a little thicker.  If you only want these for details and not for painting a base coat, they should be fine. However, if you want to paint your nails a solid color, these are not for you.</li>
    <li> What great nail art polish!  So easy to use.  Highly suggested.  Quick shipping, and great packaging.  I love doing my nails and not having to go to the salon.</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful but he product is thick and seems to be a little old or something .. But ok... I won&#x27;t buy it again but the grand kids love them</li>
    <li> thankyou very much i am very happy with my set i will be ordering from you again :-) A+++++ :-)</li>
    <li> My fiance wanted to get me these because he thought I would like the variety of other colors. I had fun trying the colors out on him (such a trooper) the brush tips are very slim so it makes it very easy to do different designs unlike the O.P.I where the brush tips are kind of short and wide. I did not like them when I first saw how slim the brush tips were but after using them it was much better than i thought it would be so I am very pleased with these.</li>
    <li> As a gift.  She helped pick out the set and was AMAZED when they showed up.  My wife has a lot of nail accessories and since she got this set, its her go-to collection.  She says the polish chips less and stays on longer than most other brands she has used.  Looking forward to buying the next part of the set.  Great packaging, they come in a nice box that makes storing, as well as browsing your collection quick and enjoyable.</li>
    <li> It was cool enough. received it faster than expected. Been doing really cool nail designs with the colors. Love the array of colors provided and happy about the purchase. No regrets</li>
    <li> Shipped Fast &amp; Looks Great !!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and transaction...Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I had paid more attention to the pictures. I thought I was buying a set of nail polish, but in fact, these are polishes made specifically for designs. If I had looked at the pictures, I would have seen the thin brush. Not bad quality polish, I&#x27;ve just got to learn to use them now.</li>
    <li> Shany is the best nail art products you can find! I bought it for my daughter and immediatly realized I wanted it for me! The price is spot on, but the product is even better. Even my cosmetologist friend went crazy over these products. Buy them all, we did!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product and I just can&#x27;t wait to use them! They also came on time And I was sooo exited once they came!</li>
    <li> I just got it and they are really colorful! I love doing nails and I love bright color. It came with two boxes which are safe because I was worried about it might get broke somewhere... Some of them have shiny power as well, love it! For a affordable price, it is really worth it!</li>
    <li> Wow , i liked it , it is good for drawing</li>
    <li> A gift to a friend who does art work. She loves the colors and the bottles are easy to hold &amp; paint designs.</li>
    <li> Order arrived a bit late, but they provided ample warning and apologies. A few bottles were a bit sticky when I tried out several of the polishes; some of the brush bristles were falling out while applying but nothing too horrible. 4 of 5 for variety, color and good communication.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors for nail art.  Fun, fun, fun.</li>
    <li> While the colors were nice, the polish itself was poor quality. It seemed to be very old, and was slightly congealed in the bottle. As such, when I did manage to get some onto my nails, it was too thick so it wouldn&#x27;t dry. Many of the bottles were difficult to open the first time because there was a thick crust of dried polish gluing the cap to the bottle. Also, the bristles on the brushes of a lot of the bottles were bent or sticking out, and came off of the brush completely. However, the few bottles that didn&#x27;t have these problems actually worked very nicely.</li>
    <li> I bought it because its very cheap and i loved the colors for my kids. i swear it has every color i could ask for in this 24 bottle set! its very awesome. it dries quick enough and doesnt chip very easy. least not in my cases. I would recommand this for everyone with kids or without kids. its amazing!!</li>
    <li> Dries so quickly if your still painting it clumps, Tiny brushes, and it won&#x27;t come off even with nail polish remover.  Amazon won&#x27;t let me return it and I cannot get a refund  :-(</li>
    <li> Yes. Nail polish takes a while to dry, but this is ridiculous.  Twenty minutes to dry for certain colors and other colors remain tacky for an extended period of time.  In a day or two they&#x27;re already chipped and ruined.  Just be careful if you buy.</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful and just like it was pictured. It came with a lot of different colors and a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe the  great quality and quantity for such a great price.  I will definitely be buying more Shany Cosmetic products.</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary set from Crowdtap in the U by kotex party kit. I liked that there was a good variety of colors and the polish did not stain my nails after I used them. The polish lasted about a week and did not chip and went on smooth. It&#x27;s a nice kit.</li>
    <li> These are really gloopy. That&#x27;s not a real word but I bet you know exactly what I mean. I really like the colors but the quality of the polish is just not there, they thicken up as soon as you open them and get clumpy and hard to apply. Tiny dots become huge globs after your first use.</li>
    <li> Love the colors. Didn&#x27;t get any doubles. 1 bottle was not fully closed and the bottle chipped on the neck of the bottle. But being where the break was I just closed it and it is still usable. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for painting your full nail (It is for art), but I would for stamping and nail art. Small brushes great for that. Not all work for stamping though, like the metallic ones.</li>
    <li> Decent value with lots of colors. Not the top quality polish I&#x27;ve had but great for the price. Vibrant colors. Polish does get thick and sticky before used up. Close caps as soon as possible and they last longer.</li>
    <li> The colors are very bright and that makes it so hard to choose.  My daughter loved this set, there are very bright and glitter and dark colors as well.  Great set, we just love it!</li>
    <li> The price on this 24 bottle kit is amazing! It is gift ready to give and the colors are brilliant. Only one coat gives a beautiful effect. Professional look!</li>
    <li> Strong odor is my only complaint...but only b/c I have a lung disease...other than that, very nice...pretty colors and easy application...</li>
    <li> It is quick dry and no duplicate colors. This is great for small designs, stripes and such. Also fantastic for small designs of stamping plates, and 5stars for the performance in the use of stamping. I only gave this 4stars overall because the hairs on the brushes of like 25% of them were uneven with like one wispy one that I had to snip off myself. No big deal but because of the unexpected annoyance, 4stars. Package was great, no broken or misaligned lids. Good color selection.</li>
    <li> My fiancee loved this set, though one of the colors came in with one of the polishes open so it was mostly dried out.  Luckily it was a color she wouldn&#x27;t use much so no big deal.  Other than that it is a great gift for girls.</li>
    <li> Niece loves them it will keep her coloured up for the next few months to try it out with new clothes and to get better with plenty practise,will buy again</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised, for the price I wasnt expecting such greatest product but I was wrong... you get a tone of colors in good sized containers, and the paint is of great quality !</li>
    <li> I bought this as a christmas gift for my sister and she loved it. It arrived on time for christmas.</li>
    <li> I got this for my best friend for Christmas, because she loves doing her nails and she adored it. She screamed so loud she almost caused me to go deaf. She&#x27;s very happy with the quality and the variety of colors considering she yelled \\&quot;AAH! LOOK AT THE COLORS!\\&quot; Haha, it made her very happy c:</li>
    <li> My daughter loves all the colors!</li>
    <li> Product was shipped sooner than expected. Arrived in a nice box with protective wrapping and plastic display case. No damage. Would have liked to see a better variety of colors. No white, black or yellow. Mostly glitter and one duplicate. Product looks nice. Dries in average time. Smells a bit stronger than most polishes but not too bad. Perfect for your average nail decorating. Don&#x27;t forget a clear coat or it will come off easily.</li>
    <li> Great colors in good condition.  I would prefer (due to skill level) if the brushes were short and therefore easier to control.  The long thin brushes make it a challenge to get really detailed.  I will be purchasing a finer brush.</li>
    <li> Nail polish never dries. And when it finally does it is still tacky and easily damaged, some bottles had spilled colors on them, and bottles were not all full</li>
    <li> Pretty colors when looking at the bottles, but at least 4 bottles were broken an had dried up polish around the top and sides.  Polish dries dull and mattte looking.</li>
    <li> I recieved my SHANY 24 piece art set last night and IM IN LOVE!!! They came packaged very nicely and neat! No broken bottles or leaky bottles! I shakes every color and opened them they all were identical in consistency and were smooth!! I am more than satisfied! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND EVERYONE to have a set!! I was a little nervous at first but I&#x27;m so happy it&#x27;s so worth the money for the variety and the only place on the web to find such a variety in a 24 pack that are decent size bottles (NOT MINI BOTTLES)! I&#x27;m just curious it says &amp;#34;Nail Art Set 1&amp;#34; are there other sets? If so I want them too! Love love love 😍😍😍</li>
    <li> Everything came packaged just fine.  Nothing leaking or broken.  Got these specifically for nail art stamping.  Some of them are too thin to use, but most will work just fine.  Great to have all of the different colors to try.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this set. Good quality &amp; quantity &#x3D; good deal. Shipped on time</li>
    <li> I just received the SHANY Nail Art Set (24 colors) and to be honest, for as inexpensive as this is I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be this nice. The variety of colors is wonderful, there are some really beautiful ones in this collection. I swatched about half of the colors so far, and am happy to say they are very much worth the money! I was most pleased by the white. I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a white that actually covers in one coat, and this white was able to completely cover a dark red and navy blue in one coat. The the glitter polishes are also amazing, they give a ton of glitter in a single coat, where most glitter polishes you need a few coats to start to really get that sparkle.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are thin,(I have seen a lot of people down grade because they say the brushes are too small) but remember this is a NAIL ART set, they are supposed to be thin. If you want standard brushes, then you are looking at the wrong set. Really to me it&#x27;s not that big of a deal, I chose a set with smaller brushes to be able to do more than just cover the nail. However, covering the nail with these smaller brushes just means a few extra strokes.&lt;br /&gt;Over all I am thrilled with this set, and am looking forward to purchasing SHANY in the future!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really hard to get the fingernail polish off.</li>
    <li> Delivery was SUPER Fast. Item was exactly as pictured. Came in a little display case and there were 24 Different colors. No duplicates as mentioned in some comments. I was worried about that but these are Great for the money. Pleased with the purchase!</li>
    <li> Great set!! Well worth the money!!</li>
    <li> a gift for a 15-year-old, she was THRILLED!</li>
    <li> one bottle had a broken cap, so the polish had dried up in that bottle.It didn&#x27;t leak out and make a mess. So many colors for that price I didn&#x27;t mind enough to return item.still a great deal even it is -1 color. I would order again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and wife so that they would have something to use together. It worked well. Nice selection of colors. Good price.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and intact! Beautiful bright colors, couple of them were made pretty thick but nothing a little thinner couldn&#x27;t fix!</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly, Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Love all the colors. Got this for 3 grand daughters, they love it.</li>
    <li> BE warned that they have fine tips for painting so it will go a little slower but it is no low quality polish</li>
    <li> I love the variety of colors and the quality is great. Shipped very quickly, got my order 3 days after I purchased it.</li>
    <li> they are ok! colors are nice but get thick really quick</li>
    <li> My daughter and wife love these colors and for the price I do too!!!</li>
    <li> Product arrived in a timley manner. I absolutly love these! The color goes on great it&#x27;s thick enough to be layed for different nail designs. The variety is perfect, I have 2 daughters so I definately get to use every color and be \\&quot;the greatest mom ever\\&quot;. You cannot beat the price for the amazing quality you get. Will be buying for my friends&#x27; birthday&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Wow and wow.again such a range of colors shipped fast..arrived in great.shape..look out nails I can change every day with a new look..bottles perfect size..</li>
    <li> Sending these back. They&#x27;re very thin and cheap. Look is absolutely terrible. The brush is also very thin and small, so it&#x27;s hard to get good coverage. The colors look awesome and packing is very sturdy, so this is very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I got this in a sample kit and the quality of the products are great. some of the light colors require two coats but i love the variety of color available. i kept a bottle and gave away the rest, so i&#x27;m definitely thinking about purchasing a set for myself. also, it dries very quick!</li>
    <li> This set is an instant collection of nail colors. Thanks!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re decent. They&#x27;re a little watery, but do the job for a beginner.</li>
    <li> This is FANTASTIC... Great colors and a fantastic price!!!</li>
    <li> They arrived on the date they said they&#x27;d be here..that&#x27;s always a plus!! No bottles broke and all colors are different no repeats. A great product and buy!!</li>
    <li> This collection is really super and reasonably priced. The brushes are thin but you might want to invest in brushes that are even thinner for the more smaller detailing.The colors are vibrant and salon worthy</li>
    <li> My daughter was extremly happy with the set, which makes me very happy. My twelve year old and her friends have recently developed a huge intrest in painting their nails and nail art. The cost of the nail art brushes and pens in our local stores are rediculous. The set is a great value and she was so excited about all the colors. She has already created several different designs and has had friends over to do their nails. She was a little nervous about them being brush style rather than pen style but she soon realized that the brush is not that hard to control to achieve the design that you want. I have even given it a try and painted zebra print nails on her nails....it was fun and came out great! We are both extremly happy!!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought for my 87 year old mom, she loves it, so many colors</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait until other colors are back in stock. These colors are amazing and they wear long and well. They are worth it for the money. I got mad compliments!</li>
    <li> Got what I expected but one of the bottles had been opened &amp; used a lil &amp; had sum nail polish smeared on the lid. I also got one duplicate. Other than that no complaints.</li>
    <li> Goods&lt;br /&gt;-you get 24 colors!&lt;br /&gt;-packed nicely just like in the photos.&lt;br /&gt;-pirce for 24 set is awsome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad&lt;br /&gt;-few colors hardly shows on your nail ex.yellows and lighted one mostly.&lt;br /&gt;-the tip is super fine that its kinda hard to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its preaty good when you are learing to nail art. you get 24 colors for a the price even if the product is a little cheap.</li>
    <li> You know if people were to try these before all others, companies would be going bankrupt.  Everything you need is right here in this convenient little set.  Whether stamping, striping, or creating one of a kind arts, this is the set you need to do it.  I want to try everything that shares that Shany label because so far, I am nothing less then amazed by every product they produce.</li>
    <li> Most of the colors are amazing. There a couple colors that are very opaque and require far too many coats to see the actual color that you want.</li>
    <li> I just received this item yesterday and the colors are beautiful! The thin design tip brush is of good quality and makes drawing straight lines super easy and very professional looking. My teenage daughters think I&#x27;m the greatest Mom ever as they love this product too. Thank you!</li>
    <li> The tips of the brush aren&#x27;t precised at all ! Requested a return but was denied! Save your money and go to Walmart, Sally&#x27;s, nail supply store so you can actually look at it yourself .. I thought I was getting a good deal buying it in bulk but now I have wasted my money!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just fine.Not that good.&lt;br /&gt;Because it is cheap, I can understand it.&lt;br /&gt;But it has many colors you can choose.</li>
    <li> I love the colors and they dry quick. But they have strange long brushes that makes it hard to paint your nails but good for making some designs. The other problem was one bottle was so dried up it was empty and another one I could not get the lid off at all. The glitter polishes are great.</li>
    <li> They are awesome. I like the package they came in. I don&#x27;t need to buy anything to put them in. They work very well I love it</li>
    <li> These colors are great.  My niece loved them.  I first purchased the wrong thing.  Then she pointed this out.  The colors are good and the price is better.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Just received my nail art set in the mail and when I first opened the box I could clearly smell nail polish. I thought it was just bc it was a big set of polish but when I opened the smaller box it was in I noticed some of the bottles had leaked all inside the box. Disappointed. I haven&#x27;t used the polishes yet but as for my first impression I wasn&#x27;t happy about several bottles leaking half of the polish every where.</li>
    <li> I received the nail polish set as a gift, as others have said the colors are are brilliant and true, does take longer to dry, and one of mine had begun to leak, my biggest problem is the smell it lasted over 6 hours gave me a slight headache, it&#x27;s just gross, once that went away the polish stayed on 4 days without chipping or peeling. I&#x27;ll just have to remember to do my nails the night before going out, yes the smell was that strong i would be embarrassed to go out in public..</li>
    <li> This is a great idea, lots of bright colors to paint your nails, just got it and am having fun.</li>
    <li> I love the colors, I just wish the brushes were thicker.  They are so thin that it is harder to paint my nails.</li>
    <li> Nice selection of colors but too many are translucent colors which limits your use in designing any patterns&lt;br /&gt;Brushes are junk and if I had realized I could not return the item, I probably would not have even bought it.</li>
    <li> Although this was a good value for the amount of colors you are getting, the color/polish quality isn&#x27;t that great.  Most of the colors are runny and watery. Only a small few of them are actually solid and give off good color. Most of them you need to paint over multiple times, and sometimes even then it&#x27;s not very solid looking. A few of them actually give off no color at all, just watery liquid, even after multiple applications. Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this brand of polish.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves to do her nails and this gave her a whole palette of colors to choose from</li>
    <li> Gift for a niece who specializes in nail art and she loved them.  Enough said!  I was the cool aunt.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I made a really cool nail design the day I got it and it lasted for 5 days! It started to chip a little on the 4th day and I didn&#x27;t even use top coat! The brush is super thin and I have short nails so it works really good for people with long and short nails! I absolutely love this and it&#x27;s totally worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> i love mine. there are some really cute colors and plenty of shades to choose from. i use mine for nail art or even use them on my stamp plates and they work great.</li>
    <li> I am new to nail art so this is a great started set. I with there would have been some metallic colors and not so many glitters.&lt;br /&gt;This set was packaged very well, no breakage or leakage.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed with the brush quality. The red polish did not have any bristles on the end of the wand and several of the others don&#x27;t stay attached to the top.&lt;br /&gt;The polish seems to be good quality.</li>
    <li> My 10 year old daughter loves the colors and the easy use wand</li>
    <li> This is probably the worst nail polish I have ever purchased. It is clumpy, and sticky, and does not come off well with remover.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. Colors are dry and not bright.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I did my daughters nails and they are awesome and she loves them! I hope that more people understand that this is a great artistic set for nails not just a ordinary polish even tho u can use it that way too!! Yall rock!!</li>
    <li> Let me start off with the colors are great! However, the product is cheap. You really do get what you pay for here. When applying they clump up so fast I can&#x27;t even use it. I really wanted to like this, and thought the negative reviews where just exaggerating. They weren&#x27;t. It&#x27;s bad, really bad. Even Wet &#x27;n Wild blows these away. Save your money people, seriously.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize all of these brushes are super thin.  Some of the brushes are not smooth the bristles sticking out in odd directions.</li>
    <li> OMG! This is the best product i ever bought!! thanks alot, love the colors and quality! Fast dry!!! And fast delivery!! Thanks alot i do RECOMMEND this product for yall!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love all the colors these come with.  There is such a variety to choose from!  Easy to use and nice product.</li>
    <li> These are more great gifts for my wife. She loves the glitter colors. I will make a follow -up comment after she tries them for the first time. Thank you.</li>
    <li> nice colors and perfect to make nail art on your own</li>
    <li> I received these very quickly! The colors are excellent, easy to use</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this nail polish set when I first found it, but I&#x27;m so glad I bought it! It has 24 awesome colors, including neon colors and a sparkly gold color :) They&#x27;re all fine-tip brushes too, so I can use them for nail art ;D I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> They are a great set of nail polish to have when you need to look ur best for any occasion especially when u have to do it yourself. Wonderful</li>
    <li> This nail art set arrived and I was completely surprised by the excellent quality.  I used it for a girls&#x27; night, and 90 young ladies were thrilled by how well this product worked.  They played, decorated, created, and otherwise enjoyed the product for hours.  I would highly recommend it for being very high quality, having vibrant colors, full-sized bottles, and great texture for nail art.  Amazing quality, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I just need the tools now. I use the glitter ones on my design and it looks cool. Thank you</li>
    <li> i love all the colors that came with this nail art set. from now on i will purchase all of my nail products from SHANY</li>
    <li> Did you ever buy something as a gift and want to keep it yourself?  My daughter just got a new job that she&#x27;s very excited about and I bought this and some &#x27;nail jewels&#x27; as an &amp;#34;I&#x27;m proud of you and congratulations&amp;#34; gift.  I think I&#x27;ll need to order another because I want to keep it!  Fun colors, good price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Every color was exactly as in the bottle.  Good brushes.  Able to draw awesome designs and neat lines. Great set for the money.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Does smell strong and if u put on too much it peels off but pigment is great so don&#x27;t put thick layers on and it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> I wanted a lot of polish colors without going to a store and dropping a load of money so I bought this set...You do get a lot of polish for the price and the colors are nice, and as someone mentioned before the smell is not particularly strong, it smells like a mixture of bubble gum and sunscreen. The con is the polish itself, maybe I&#x27;ve been spoiled with other name brand polishes but this stuff takes FOREVER to dry. It goes gummy almost as soon as you put it on your nails, so the first few times you use the polish you are bound to get bumpy, uneven coats - but then once it is on and gooey, it stays that way for a looong time. I don&#x27;t know if it is that the polish is thicker than other brands or if it somehow dries from the inside out, but don&#x27;t plan on doing anything at all with your hands for at least an hour afterwards unless you want to spend another hour on touching up.</li>
    <li> These nail art polishes are great.</li>
    <li> Brushes bent, the polish doesn&#x27;t go on nicely, also goes on too thick not good for detail work</li>
    <li> Great product. It was packaged very well and all the nail polishes were great.</li>
    <li> I received my package today. All the the nail polishes were accounted for and intact. They were packaged extremely well so they may have changed the packaging style since others have purchased and had problems with the packaging. The colors are so vibrant and the brushes are perfect for nail art designs and I can&#x27;t wait to get practicing to show off my decorated toes in my flip flops this summer!!</li>
    <li> Great product arrived on time</li>
    <li> I received my package early and was so happy to open it! The photos the site has on here doesn&#x27;t showcase the colors of the paint as well as they are in real life. Beautiful colors! Used the white as a sample right after receiving them and it worked great! Can&#x27;t wait to use them all! Also, packaging was appropriate and nothing was broken. Good job, Shany Cosmetics!</li>
    <li> This is a great set for any nail polish user!! There is every color you could possibly imagine. This is the real deal, you will never have to buy another nail art color again!! Great quality as well!!</li>
    <li> This product is ok. I love the fact that it has a holder for it, but the polish is not as great as it looks. It is ok for people that aren&#x27;t to picky about their nail polish.</li>
    <li> Wish there was a photo of how thin and small the brush is. I wanted an actual brush, it&#x27;s impossible to paint the entire nail with the brush. The next day the nail-polish was chipping. I&#x27;m not satisfied.</li>
    <li> Definitely not worth the price at all. I am sure you can buy something similar at the dollar store. Low quality!</li>
    <li> Great product, price, &amp; shipping arrival timing!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece for Christmas and she loved having so many beautiful color choices for her nails.  Great value.</li>
    <li> as an accomplished nail artiest the colors are great however the brushes are too thick. Detailed nail art is impossible with this product.</li>
    <li> Very poorly made. Half of the colors are see through no matter how many coats you go over. And the other half, the bottles were very clumpy, globby and very thick and just kept getting thicker in the bottle every time I used it. Very hard to use and looks horrible. It was really stringy, would not even drip they were so thick, they just kept a string from the bottle to the brush. I had to add nail polish remover to most of them which seemed to help, but I feel I should have to do no mixing with brand new nail polish. Chips and comes of very easy. Does not last long. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> i think that these art pens are one of the best ones that i have gotten in a long while! they are super pigmented. even the sparkles! you will be very pleased with this product when you receive it! my personal favorite is numbers 11-15 becauase they are the sparkles! i really will enjoy these for a while becauase there is so much product in the bottles and they have very fine tip brushes!</li>
    <li> This Nail Art Set is amazing. The colors are rich and bold. The small tip brush is perfect for making designs and the polish itself dries quickly! I received this set for Christmas and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! Keep up the amazing work!</li>
    <li> I bought these nail art stripers for my girlfriend and she is in love with them. The colors are beautiful and show up brilliantly. The brush is the perfect size and they have such a good color pay off even on a dark base color. Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> The quality of the polish is too sticky. It&#x27;s hard to get on smoothly and takes much scrubbing with remover to get off. Plus it dyes my nails.</li>
    <li> I love doing my nails --like I&#x27;m obsessed-- and I needed more thin tipped nail polishes for designs and what not I figured I&#x27;d buy in bulk. This brand has some nice polish for the price. Considering buying more!</li>
    <li> My daughter really loves this set.  All bottles were in great condition.  She has used all the colors and has done her friends nails.</li>
    <li> Great assortment of colors, good sized brush for painting either the whole nail, or doing a little artwork. Comes in a nice package set.</li>
    <li> I am new to the nail art stuff and this is a great beginner&#x27;s kit. It has a wide variety of GREAT colors. The consistency of the polish is good. I&#x27;m looking forward to the possibilities. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time.&lt;br /&gt;Great colors.&lt;br /&gt;No broken ones or duplicate colors like some comments say.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve made super cute designs with them!&lt;br /&gt;If i could give 6 stars i would :)</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t be more happy with Shany nail art set!! The colors are fab and the service was excellent I received them within two days. I love doing my nails and don&#x27;t like paying the prices at nail salons. I found this product perfect and easy to use.</li>
    <li> im glad i was able to shop on Amazon and receive my polish i love it and it was super cheep thanks a lot Amazon...</li>
    <li> Ordered this as a gift for a friend and she loved it. Thank you! Shipped from China so expected delays. Other than that it was good.</li>
