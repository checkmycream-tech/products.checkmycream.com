    <li> Plumps up the eyes enough to most definitely minute the appearance of fine lines around the eyes. I&#x27;m a 30 year old makeup artist, so looking fresh is a must!</li>

    <li> The best night eye cream I&#x27;ve found</li>
    <li> Very nice eye cream.  Use at night and wake up with great looking eyes.  Seems to lessen the appearance of fine lines.</li>
    <li> I noticed an improvement in crepiness after the first week with this product. Not bad for a topical cream! I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Nice and clean, no perfume or burning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Bioelements for years and highly recommend it for dry skin. Everybody thinks I&#x27;m 20 years younger than i am!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a very long time and can highly recommend it. However be careful where you purchase from. Do not pay for a 0.5oz. That is a free sample size!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have very dry, crepey undereye skin. Sleepwear for Eyes moisturized them better than any eye cream I have tried so far, and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried too many to count from drugstore brands to very pricey lines. Well, I have a confession to make: no daytime cream helped the dryness, so I&#x27;ve started using Sleepwear in the morning too. It absorbs immediately on my superdry skin, leaving no greasiness. My crepiness goes away and my fine lines are plumped up. To my delight, this cream did not interfere with applying concealer on my nasty allergy shiners or affect the longevity of it. This eye cream may be too heavy for most people to use in the daytime, but worked wonderful for me. I do have sensitive skin, but haven&#x27;t had any reactions.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and I use this along with Bioelements Sleepwear before i go to bed.  It&#x27;s perfect.  It makes the area around my eyes feel soft.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any change in the lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> My fine lines are vanishing!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing- people have actually asked me if I had work done!</li>
    <li> Best eye cream I have ever used</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and was recommend to use this in conjunction with the Oil Control Sleepwear for my face. I definitely noticed a difference after the first couple of weeks and have purchased it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, La Prairie, Kate Somerville and others. This eye cream is light, smells delicious and works.  I have the night cream as well, equally as awesome.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t see any results</li>
    <li> I researched this product, reading reviews,  I was excited to try it as my age(44) is showing around my eyes.  I developed a horrible rash after using this product.  I awoke with read extremely puffy  skin around my eyes that hurt and itched.  I stopped using product and tried again a couple weeks later, hoping it was just a coincidence, but again here I sit with painful red itchy welts around my eyes that take many days to recover.</li>
    <li> This product works good but make sure not to get it to close to your eyes.  It seems like my eyes water a lot when using this product.</li>
    <li> Love this - just got back from 3 wks in Ireland.  Everything looks like I&#x27;ve been traveling a lot except my eyes! : )  Thanks</li>
    <li> Pretty happy with product......wish it had a little more moisture.</li>
    <li> Smells clean, works nicely at night.  Good product.  A facial therapist introduced me to this line of skin care.  They know best, right?</li>
    <li> Love this product! Much cheaper to buy through Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Very nice eye cream, loaded with goodies.  I wake up with refreshed looking eyes.  This has no fragrance which is a bonus.  Do wish it came in a pump, but still love it.  I also use the Sleepwear moisturizer on my face.  Bioelements is a very good line.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and recommend it.  It is refreshing and moisturizing without being overly greasy.</li>
