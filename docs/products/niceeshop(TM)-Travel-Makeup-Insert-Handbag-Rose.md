      <li>They fit in my large purses great.</li>
      <li>My leather planner is tucked in there safely and securely.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s so cheaply made.</li>
      <li>Very happy with these, have ordered quite a few.</li>
      <li>Roomy, welll made and insanely cheap</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised at people complaining about the quality--I think it&#x27;s pretty darn great for the money.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s holding up great--and it keeps my purse (normally a disaster zone) quite nicely organized.</li>
      <li>I love this item so much that I am also buying another one for my daughter&#x27;s diaper bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Ripped at my first use!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted when I&amp;#34; ordered this.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go!</li>
      <li>The stitching came undone the first week.</li>
      <li>They are very durable and there are so many different pockets, so it makes organizing a breeze.</li>
      <li>I change handbags frequently and these make it super quick and easy and keeps small thing arranged and easy to find.</li>
      <li>Took so long to arrive but was glad it arrived before vacation.  </li>
      <li>It is quite large.</li>
      <li>On the outside of the organizer, on both sides, are multiple large pockets and slide pockets, ( for all those loyalty cards we carry, credit cards, and more)!</li>
      <li>They are large enough to fit a lot of stuff in them.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>The pouch itself does not add much weight to my purse but</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really practical.</li>
      <li>and it kept my things very organized in my purse.</li>
      <li>Much better than expected for the price...</li>
      <li>And It didn&#x27;t even have much in it.</li>
      <li>I really like these purse organizers.</li>
      <li>That said, given the price, one cannot complain too much.</li>
      <li>They are very soft and pretty, and have all kinds of pockets.</li>
      <li>I have bought several of these purse organizers in different colors and I love them.</li>
      <li>She highly recommend.</li>
      <li>this is my third one, all have been a little different, but they are great to help organize me.</li>
      <li>I think I will buy a few more as gifts.</li>
      <li>I can fit a water bottle, a book, keys, phone and other essentials.  </li>
      <li>They do wear out after a year or so, but for the price don&#x27;t complain, buy a new color.</li>
      <li>In the center is a very large compartment with two additional large zippered compartments on either side.</li>
      <li>Very very very surprised by getting it so early.</li>
      <li>I keep keys and such in center where I can get to them easily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had other purse organizers that had flimsy fabric, less compartments and cost a whole lot more.</li>
      <li>Still going to use it until it completely rips apart and is no longer functional.  </li>
      <li>Actually, in a masculine color, a man could use it to organize smaller items to put in a backpack for hiking, etc.</li>
      <li>Love the idea ~ poor quality.</li>
      <li>One zipper failed early on, had to cut it open, overall a nice idea to keep purse irganized</li>
      <li>I mainly purchased this because I assumed it was purple and pink.</li>
      <li>Although the pouch and compartments seem to be pretty sturdy, there were some pieces of black fabric that were sewn in to some of the seams in the blue areas (mine was blue).  </li>

<li> too small..</li>
<li> It&#x27;s really ugly :/</li>
<li> Very disappointing.</li>

    <li> Great organizer and so cheap! Much better than expected for the price... I ended up ordering a 2nd one.</li>
    <li> Very nice ordered twice.</li>
    <li> I really like these purse organizers. this is my third one, all have been a little different, but they are great to help organize me. I keep keys and such in center where I can get to them easily. One zippered pockets hold coupons and receipts, one of the open pouches hold lip gloss, makeup etc. I change handbags frequently and these make it super quick and easy and keeps small thing arranged and easy to find. They do wear out after a year or so, but for the price don&#x27;t complain, buy a new color.</li>
    <li> Very nice and it kept my things very organized in my purse. Not to big either and I loved how I could transport my things from one baga to another in a matter of seconds.</li>
    <li> Nice organizer. Just make sure and notice the shopping time as it takes 4-6 weeks</li>
    <li> Great for my planner. Lots of people put their planner supplies in these, I put my leather planner in these. They are very soft and pretty, and have all kinds of pockets. My leather planner is tucked in there safely and securely. Very happy with these, have ordered quite a few. Love them all. Some are on my desk with pens, and stickers, and stamps, and girl stuff!</li>
    <li> I have bought several of these purse organizers in different colors and I love them. They are large enough to fit a lot of stuff in them. They fit in my large purses great. I think I will buy a few more as gifts.</li>
    <li> These bags are amazing! I now own 2 of them. They are very durable and there are so many different pockets, so it makes organizing a breeze. I love that there are a variety of pockets as well- there are zippered pockets, mesh pockets, and open flap pockets! Great for organizing!</li>
    <li> Love the product and love the price it works perfectly in my LV speedy 30 👌</li>
    <li> Have given several away as gifts! Great value!</li>
    <li> delivered before expected.  Nice product.</li>
    <li> Lets me change purses quickly without leaving behind essentials.  Lots of pockets for both large and small items.  The pouch itself does not add much weight to my purse but the things I fill it with does. 😀</li>
    <li> I love this item so much that I am also buying another one for my daughter&#x27;s diaper bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;def recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Better than I thought, buy it you will love it</li>
    <li> The stitching came undone the first week. I guess you get what u pay for.</li>
    <li> The color and the size was great. Well put together.</li>
    <li> Took so long to arrive but was glad it arrived before vacation.  Just what I was looking for and was so convenient to transfer from one handbag to another.  ALREADY SIDE SEAM HAS BEGUN TO SEPARATE!!!  Still going to use it until it completely rips apart and is no longer functional.  Love the idea ~ poor quality.</li>
    <li> Color appeared to be pink and purple on picture but is actually pink and gray. I mainly purchased this because I assumed it was purple and pink. Described as being a smaller bag but is quite big.</li>
    <li> Love that I don&#x27;t have to dig around my purse anymore!</li>
    <li> Ripped at my first use! And It didn&#x27;t even have much in it.</li>
    <li> Roomy, welll made and insanely cheap The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars has nothing to do with product quality It took a longer time to be delivered and there was no tracking The color I ordered was pink and purple The one they sent was pink and grey</li>
    <li> One zipper failed early on, had to cut it open, overall a nice idea to keep purse irganized</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised at people complaining about the quality--I think it&#x27;s pretty darn great for the money. Heck, for twice the price. It&#x27;s holding up great--and it keeps my purse (normally a disaster zone) quite nicely organized. Me likey.</li>
    <li> I gave it to my wife and she loved. Good quality and perfect to organize her handbag. She highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I just received my purse organizer a couple of days ago. I absolutely love it. It is quite large. I am able to store everything I need and more. I still have tons of space left to fill. In the center is a very large compartment with two additional large zippered compartments on either side. On the outside of the organizer, on both sides, are multiple large pockets and slide pockets, ( for all those loyalty cards we carry, credit cards, and more)! I could not believe everything that I was able to get into this organizer. Changing purses will be a breeze. All I have to do is pick up my organizer and put it in another purse and I&#x27;m ready to go! There are even two little handles to pick up and remove the organizer from your purse. The quality is nice. Like I mentioned earlier, I&#x27;ve only had it for two days, but I believe that the fabric will be durable and last for a long time. I&#x27;ve had other purse organizers that had flimsy fabric, less compartments and cost a whole lot more. Now I know what to get all the women in my life for birthdays and Christmas presents, and what a deal! Actually, in a masculine color, a man could use it to organize smaller items to put in a backpack for hiking, etc.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for switching bags and keeping everything together!  It can go from my purse to my back pack to a beach bag.  I can fit a water bottle, a book, keys, phone and other essentials.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Although the pouch and compartments seem to be pretty sturdy, there were some pieces of black fabric that were sewn in to some of the seams in the blue areas (mine was blue).  It seems to me that these might be the &amp;#34;rejects&amp;#34; from the factory line.  That said, given the price, one cannot complain too much.</li>
    <li> Omg love love love it!  I use it as my coupon organizer and it was so inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted when I&amp;#34; ordered this.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic, just like I hoped!</li>
    <li> Product is as described. I ordered a pink bag and what I got is red with pink mesh. Good thing this goes in a bag. It&#x27;s really ugly :/</li>
    <li> too small..nothing fits but a key, powder compact and a small coin purse</li>
    <li> I already have one and ordering another for a friend! I just loooove it! It&#x27;s really practical.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great concept but it&#x27;s so cheaply made. It just arrived and I already broke the zipper on one of the zippered compartments. I basically have to throw it away now. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Very very very surprised by getting it so early. I ordered two of them on 6 Nov and I get them today 16 Nov.&lt;br /&gt;I m very happy with the colours and quality and fast shipping service but I m taking one star bcz of poor chain quality as described in previous reviews, but I will manage it by not operating them very often bcz they will remain inside my purse.&lt;br /&gt;Also the zippers have tendency to stuck at the ends so I have one suggestion for this that take a needle and thread and make loop just before the end of zipper by taking several stiches around it so that the zipper closure will not come out.:-)&lt;br /&gt;Now I can use my single compartment purse for travelling. Thanks</li>
