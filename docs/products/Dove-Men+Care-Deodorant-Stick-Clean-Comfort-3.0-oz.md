      <li>I start to smell myself after a day of doing nothing, and I have never noticed my own body odor before using this product.</li>

      <li>Good job Dove!is appropriately named.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice in the tube but does nothing for you once on.</li>
      <li>I liked the most!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So be on the lookout for this kind of issue.</li>
      <li>He loves this brand, but be cautious as to which kind you buy.</li>
      <li>However, I find this to smell nice and all the guys like the smell.</li>
      <li>#34;non-irritant&amp;#34;, I was thrilled.  </li>
      <li>nice deodorant for me.</li>
      <li>Out of the 3 brands Dove is the most reasonably priced, easiest to find in stores, and has the best scent.</li>
      <li>This deodorant is by far the best deodorant I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>I never thought I would find a deodorant I liked better than Mennan Musk Deodorant after using it for 30 years - but I have switched now and don&#x27;t regret my change to Dove Men Deodorant.</li>
      <li>Smells really good but the cool silver is better</li>
      <li>I really liked the smell, it smells nice and clean and refreshing.</li>
      <li>Huge bummer!  </li>
      <li>One application lasts all day in all but the most hot/sweaty conditions.</li>
      <li>Love the smell as well</li>
      <li>I love the smell and so does my girlfriend.</li>
      <li>My favorite deodorant.</li>
      <li>This meets that criteria and is appropriately named.  </li>
      <li>love the men&#x27;s dove more than any product they have on the market .</li>
      <li>This is more of a gel style deoderant</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>I just wish the scent itself had more</li>
      <li>It smells great and really helps out throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>I love this deodorant.  </li>
      <li>This one smells better and works well.</li>
      <li>Aqua Impact is my favorite scent.  </li>
      <li>I generally love Dove for Men products.  </li>
      <li>sure if this matters to most out there,</li>
      <li>I now suspect many of these glowing 5 star reviews.</li>
      <li>Been using this product for years, finally Amazon has them at a great price!</li>
      <li>While this does smell better than the Tom&#x27;s, it is not a non-irritant.</li>
      <li>Moisturizer Deodorant is now my favorite.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Better than speed stick.</li>
      <li>Both scents are nice and refreshing, but of the two I&#x27;ve tried I prefer this Clean Comfort version.  </li>
      <li>Dove has a nice clean smell and works well for my husband, even through his workouts.</li>
      <li>0 stars, it&#x27;s good at first</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this deodorant is fine for most people.  </li>
      <li>(Or I do not have a strong smell sense :) )</li>
      <li>Amazing fresh scent.</li>
      <li>Deodorant goes on clear and I haven&#x27;t experienced any staining with undershirts.</li>
      <li>My skin gets irritated easily and this hasn&#x27;t caused me any problems yet.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very mild, and I like that.</li>
      <li>I love Dove&#x27;s clean comfort, but I didn&#x27;t get what this item says, hence how I&#x27;m upset.</li>
      <li>Cool Silver smells pretty good, too.  </li>
      <li>The price is really good to for this particular scent, so that&#x27;s another plus in my book.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t need the strong stuff.</li>
      <li>My first thought was cool off to a good start.  </li>
      <li>I opened the cap for the first time and was greeted with a nice manly scent.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate at all, smells fine, works fine.</li>
      <li>I worked some 20+ hour days over an event in a suit and tie, lasted super well, even with me walking all day and being in the sun!</li>
      <li>I have used almost every thing available, and I have now settled on this.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Be advised, there is an antiperspirant version as well which is not as gentle and which ends up kind of gummy in your pit</li>
      <li>Overall, quite happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>Sounds trite, but it is gentle and effective.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Better than speed stick. This seems to be stronger, protects me for 24 hours</li>
    <li> hard to find a deodorant without anti-perspirant without aluminum in it that doesn&#x27;t have a super soapy or super sleazy AXe type smell, but this fits the bill. Smells clean, just like it says. prefer it to the more perfumy Speed Stick and Old Spice...</li>
    <li> My husband loves this deodorant only product. He cannot use antiperspirant because it causes him to form painful bumps. The Amazon ship and save price is even cheaper than the Costco 5 pack. It smells fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman, but I hate the way women&#x27;s deodorant smells on me. After I started using this I literally could not use any other product without my under arms burning, so I&#x27;m stuck using this. It&#x27;s very mild, and I like that. It&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, so if you sweat a lot you will definitely stick wearing this.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my son after he tried a sample.  He loves this product.  After working in the gym, he still smelled great.  Thanks, Amazon</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years, finally Amazon has them at a great price! Never heard of any of the issues others have reported with &amp;#34;skin flaking&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;have the skin of a rhino&amp;#34; by any means, but this product works perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> Ok, but not what I expected. It wasn&#x27;t the white solid, it was the bluish clear lookin anti perspirant.</li>
    <li> Terrible... All kinds of side effects</li>
    <li> I tried this stuff out because Old Spice deodorant gives me a rash, and to it&#x27;s credit, this product was true to it&#x27;s &#x27;Non-Irritant&#x27; label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pretty standard - nothing noteworthy, but isn&#x27;t overpowering or just plain malodorous. I prefer a more subdued scent as opposed to walking around making everyone&#x27;s face contort as if I applied too much cologne. I just wish the scent itself had more character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My single largest complaint about this deodorant is that it clearly states \\&quot;48 Hour Powerful Protection\\&quot; on the canister, but for me this stuff lasts around and average of 8 hours per application. I usually apply it around 8am, and usually by 6pm I have to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;Another slightly smaller, but still significant issue with this deodorant is that after a single application this stuff leaves a thick, waxy buildup on the skin. I&#x27;m not slathering the stuff on either, just two strokes per pit, but after a few hours it feels like I have a melted candle under each arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, it&#x27;s pretty standard, and it doesn&#x27;t give me a terrible rash...so it does its job, but only just - I think I&#x27;ll keep looking for another deodorant made for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I am usually not one to leave comments about deodorant, but in this case I must. Mens deodorants are usually high in cologne smell and are not pleasant smelling at all. Dove has a nice clean smell and works well for my husband, even through his workouts. He&#x27;s tried a lot of \\&quot;named-brand\\&quot; deodorants, but I believe this one is a keeper. The price is really good to for this particular scent, so that&#x27;s another plus in my book. Overall, quite happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> It says anti-persperant in the description but its actually just deodorant. Don&#x27;t buy this if you need anti-persperant. This is false advertising.</li>
    <li> soft fragrance and not produces irritation. It does not work in people with excessive sweating and strong odor</li>
    <li> My husband loves this brand of deodorant, but he likes the powder version over the gel. I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between the two based on what the label said, until I went into a supermarket at compared them. If the cap is see-through, you&#x27;re buying the gel version. If the cap is opaque, you&#x27;re buying the powder version. He loves this brand, but be cautious as to which kind you buy.</li>
    <li> Dove Men + Care 1/4 Moisturizer Deodorant is now my favorite. I have used almost every thing available, and I have now settled on this.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on me.. After 12 hours it stops working and you smell..</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin unlike most other brands.  However, it doesn&#x27;t last very long but it&#x27;s a necessary trade-off.</li>
    <li> It is decent but doesn&#x27;t last long but I ordered this after buying one and it didn&#x27;t stain my shirts white like Gillette.</li>
    <li> I really want a natural deodorant and can&#x27;t find one that works.  I&#x27;ve tried them all!!!  Every single one!!  I can&#x27;t wear antiperspirant and this deodorant actually works.  I usually put it on in the morning and at night.</li>
    <li> My husband has super sensitive skin.. even Tom&#x27;s deodorant makes him get rashes. This is the only deodorant we&#x27;ve found- and trust me, we&#x27;ve tried many- that doesn&#x27;t cause a reaction! Big big fans.</li>
    <li> This has been my go to Deodorant for a long time now. I&#x27;ve tried a few others and always come back to this one.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is by far the best deodorant I have ever tried. They don&#x27;t stop sweating. They make it smell nice.</li>
    <li> STICKY, GOOEY, SMELLY, not an antiperspirant</li>
    <li> A nice discreet scent, without smelling like soap, and decent perspiration protection.</li>
    <li> I paid $7.31 for these and am not dissatisfied but I&#x27;m not overly thrilled with the product either. First, it is only deodorant (no antiperspirant). Second, it reads unscented but there is definitely a scent. It&#x27;s subtle and masculine but scented. I love to try other products but always go back to the plain ol&#x27; Old Spice deodorant.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a decent-smelling deodorant and finally found one in this.  The smell is very fresh and lasts through the day.  I am a fan</li>
    <li> This deodorant goes on smooth and clear.  It has a great smell which lasts all day long!  Recommended for all men.</li>
    <li> Sticky oily junk. I bought this to try it and after a couple of days my arm pits were sticky and oily. I shower a couple of times per day and use very little of this product but I had to work hard at taking it off. I don&#x27;t recommend it and mine went in the trash.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works for about 8 hours- nowhere near the 48 hours it markets. I start to smell myself after a day of doing nothing, and I have never noticed my own body odor before using this product. Also I have found some of my shirts have underarm stains. Again, I have never had stains before using this product. I do NOT recommend this product to anyone. I am completely dissatisfied and will never buy again.</li>
    <li> Had a skin trouble with this.</li>
    <li> 0 stars, it&#x27;s good at first but then you&#x27;ll notice your skin starting to peal. It will burn if you try putting it on. Don&#x27;t buy this your pits will turn very sensitive. It doesn&#x27;t even last a hold day probably 5 hours. THE WORST IF U ASK ME!</li>
    <li> Been using Dove for Men for a few years and really enjoy the products. While some other antiperspirants may cause skin irritation, I have never had that problem with this  product. Sounds trite, but it is gentle and effective.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I have sensitive pits and this doesn&#x27;t make me itch.&lt;br /&gt;Be advised, there is an antiperspirant version as well which is not as gentle and which ends up kind of gummy in your pit hair.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it has a good smell which isn&#x27;t overly cologne-y.</li>
    <li> I buy the Dove for men deodorants all the time.  I decided to try to one and didn&#x27;t like it.  Not effective after the first 2 hours and makes you feel sticky.  Going back to the one I have been using for years.</li>
    <li> Too cakey.  Chunks break off of it and it leaves a deposite.  Usually a fan of Dove products but this one is mediocre.</li>
    <li> I did not notice anywhere in the description that this was a gel, not a solid stick.  I thought that I would try it any way.  After a week, I noticed that my underarms were itchy.  Upon checking it out, my skin was peeling under my arms and it was starting to be a little uncomfortable as far as pain goes.  I&#x27;m not sure why this happened, I use the regular stick every day.  I&#x27;ll be more careful next time I order!!!!</li>
    <li> I chose this because I have some weird armpits that are sensitive to many brands of deodorant. I have had a really good experience with this one. It seems to work well and the scent is very pleasant. I haven&#x27;t had near the issues from this that I have had from others. I will keep on buying it!</li>
    <li> Instead of receiving antiperspirant, I got normal deodorant. I love Dove&#x27;s clean comfort, but I didn&#x27;t get what this item says, hence how I&#x27;m upset.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the price to send this internationally.</li>
    <li> Dove the  ambassador for good skin care.&lt;br /&gt;I love the men&#x27;s dove more than any product they have on the market .</li>
    <li> I was not a fan of this deodorant, which was disappointing since the unscented variety of Dove Men+ Care (which is no longer manufactured) had been my deodorant of choice and personal preference. This, however, smelled like a mediocre version of a cheap cologne and lasted for a remarkably short period of time. I would not personally recommend it.</li>
    <li> For a long time, but now am converted. Smells nice, works well, and I trust Dove skincare products, so am happy to use this.</li>
    <li> I really liked the smell, it smells nice and clean and refreshing. At first, that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to not get any irritation as others have mentioned, but I give it 1 star on the 48hr claim. Put this on in the morning, by the time I leave work it&#x27;s completely worn off. Or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work at a desk job and am not particularly active during the day, but by the end of every day there would be a weird residual odor, I honestly feel like this stuff worked for 6 hours, then started teaming up with natural odor to produce something far worse. My wife said I ended up smelling like synthetic armpit by the time I got home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m not a particularly odorous guy, I shower daily and have never really had any odor before this product. When I used it though, it definitely enhanced my odor as the day went on. After about 2 weeks, I went back to my trust arm &amp; hammer deodorant and life is right again.</li>
    <li> I never do reviews but I NEEDED to say something about this one.    I have probably tried 50 deodorants in my life and I have never disliked one so much. It smells nice in the tube but does nothing for you once on. I am not a sweaty person, I don&#x27;t work out, but I smell HORRIBLE by the end of the day with this stuff.    In fact I am willing to bet that I smell better with NO deodorant than I do with this one. It&#x27;s like they just put lotion in there, and nothing else.    Also I think they took a women&#x27;s line and just put the word MEN on it. Also 48 HOUR protection was thrown on as a sticker.    Know why it&#x27;s a sticker? Because they knew not to put that bulls*** claim on the bottle, but then marketing decided they needed that claim to compete.    Sorry for the long review. Dove I will hate you and all your products forever now. I hope everyone responsible for this garbage finds a new career in waste disposal, so that can contribute to putting this garbage product where it belongs.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate at all, smells fine, works fine. But unfortunately it flakes off all over the place and, in my case, falls out the bottom of my shirt and gets all over the waistline of my pants. Or if I&#x27;m wearing short sleeves it&#x27;ll fall out the sleeve and get all over my desk.</li>
    <li> Like their soap a little over priced.  Claims 48 hours protection.  Never tried to go that long without showering and don&#x27;t intend experimenting on it.</li>
    <li> Smells great and goes on great. Put it on before flying for 5 hours and the deodorant failed completely. Awful. I now suspect many of these glowing 5 star reviews.</li>
    <li> This is the same quality product available from local stores, but at a much better price than at those stores</li>
    <li> I have used Dove Deodorant for the past 30 years exclusively. It works very well for me. I have 2 sons who have extremely sensitive skin and they break out in a horrible rash under their arms, so I made them try my Dove one day - and they loved it. No rash and it helped with their odor, which let&#x27;s face it - guys sweat stinks!!!  When Dove came out with a mens Deodorant - I went right out and them them both a few. They loved it just as much as mine, but most likely better since theirs is not for girls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a guy in your life who has sensitive skin and has a hard time with deodorants, TRY DOVE Men! You wont regret it!</li>
    <li> This order was just replenishing my supply of deodorants and it met all my expectations. It is a very good product and I definitely need the non-irritant type otherwise I have problems big time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this deodorant is fine for most people.  This is the sort where the product looks like solid gel.  Even though it is marked as non-irritant, it made my pits angry.  I gave the unopened sticks away and purchased deodorant at the local B&amp;M so I knew I was buying the white stuff.  For me, the white cakey type of deodorant is non-irritating.</li>
    <li> This works as good as any other deodorant I have tried.  The scent is light and similar to dove soap which you may or may not like.&lt;br /&gt;Update 03-11-15 - dropped from 4 to 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;This may sound like a lame reason to drop a start but I didn&#x27;t like the curve of the applicator.  It scraped my skin too much and left too much deodorant in the middle and not enough on the edges.  If it curved the other direction it would have been fine.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant.  It smells great and really helps out throughout the day.  I prefer this one versus anti-perspirants because they always leave me with this weird stuff under my arm that is extremely difficult to get off.  I don&#x27;t want to totally block sweat because then it just causes problems later.  But this deodorant works really well for me.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent!</li>
    <li> Delivered promptly with everything I wanted</li>
    <li> my mistake, I thought this was the white deodorant not the clear gel. For some reason the clear gel doesnt work at all for me. But the scent is still amazing. I gave it to my brother just not worth returning.</li>
    <li> nice deodorant for me.</li>
    <li> My husband has very sensitive skin, so when I found this and it specifically stated &amp;#34;non-irritant&amp;#34;, I was thrilled.  He&#x27;s worn it for about two weeks, and while the smell was great and it lasted all day, he&#x27;s started having a reaction with redness and peeling skin :(  Huge bummer!  If you have sensitive skin, even with the non-irritant formula, it may still yield unfortunate results.</li>
    <li> This is not the Original White Deodorant that smells nice. But I&#x27;ll use it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of deodorants over the years, and this one actually works without having an anti-perspirant in it. Love the smell as well but I understand it&#x27;s not for everyone. It has broken down on me once or twice but that was probably an application problem. I live in the deep south so a good non-irritant non-staining deodorant is a must, and this works.</li>
    <li> Lasts all day and seems to do well. Leaves a bit more filmy residue than some other deodorants that are out there it seems.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great deodorant.</li>
    <li> This is only a deodorant. Not an antipersprant and deodorant!</li>
    <li> great product --  works well -- doesn&#x27;t burn like so many others (old spice - too much alcohol) -- the stick runs down at a medium speed so you will use more that you did if your switching from old spice sport - but not nearly as fast as products like axe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it works - it would be great if it could be packed with 3 deodorants each with a different sent..</li>
    <li> The best deodorant ever. I have tried everything else, and been disappointed, but this continues to work great. The clean scent is fine for women, or men. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Dove no longer claims &amp;#34;Non-Irritant&amp;#34; on the Clean Comfort Deodorant.  On their website, only the &amp;#34;Aqua Impact&amp;#34; photo still shows &amp;#34;Non-Irritant&amp;#34;, but it could be an old photo as the claim is nowhere in the text.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is different than their Antiperspirants, which all still claim being &amp;#34;Non-Irritant&amp;#34; in both the photo and in the text.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No sure if this matters to most out there, but my skin is particularly sensitive to most deodorants.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t sweat a ton from my arm pits, so I can&#x27;t review this product for its sweat-managing properties under extreme conditions.  But I can tell you that this deodorant holds up to 1-hour CrossFit workouts, followed immediately by 1-hour gym strength workouts.  At the end of the grind-session my pits smell as clean as when I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant actually has a very nice, clean, calming smell.  It is not overpowering in the least.  I also enjoy its smell and the clean feeling it gives me (of course, it&#x27;s no substitute for a shower).</li>
    <li> Been using Dove for men deodorant for about a year now.  Aqua Impact is my favorite scent.  Cool Silver smells pretty good, too.  Just put this one on today for the first time.  Right away, I did not like the scent.  It smells like a particular brand of bar soap I&#x27;ve used before.  I can&#x27;t remember which one, but, I don&#x27;t like it.  Later that day, during my workout, I smelled a smell that I haven&#x27;t smelled in a long time.  Did a pit check, and, couldn&#x27;t believe my nose!  I stunk!  I will still use Dove for men deodorant (don&#x27;t use antiperspirant), just not this scent.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me, and, this particular scent clashes with my body chemistry.  But I have never, ever smelled using the other scents.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s deodorant - Not chalky and works well</li>
    <li> Does the job and does it well.  Wanted to steer clear of the &amp;#34;antiperspirants&amp;#34; that have aluminum oxide; found to quite possibly cause alzheimer&#x27;s disease and/or cancer. Why take that chance?</li>
    <li> Even though it&#x27;s clearly stated as being a deodorant, I didn&#x27;t realize it had no anti-perspirant.  Tried it, but was not strong enough to last all day.</li>
    <li> Great antiperspirant deodorant.   Smells great and easy on the skin.  Long-lasting sweat/odor protection.  Not the \\&quot;invisible solid\\&quot; sort, so apply it after putting on your t-shirt.    The only problem I have is that Amazon has titled the item Antiperspirant Deodorant, but shipped me the Deodorant.  Upon further inspection, the Deodorant is pictured, not the Antiperspirant Deodorant.  BIG difference.  Great price via Subscribe &amp; Save, too.  Hoping that the replacement order corrects this.</li>
    <li> People ask me all the time if I&#x27;m wearing cologne because of this deo. I love the smell and so does my girlfriend. It lasts all day for me and goes on clear. I&#x27;ve reordered 5 times now</li>
    <li> Watch out, this is DEODORANT only .... bought several of these without realizing it.  Hubby needs the dual action, not single.  Just an FYI!!</li>
    <li> What a disappointment.  I opened the cap for the first time and was greeted with a nice manly scent.  My first thought was cool off to a good start.  Well, after one hard day at work I knew this product wasn&#x27;t what they claim it to be.  It simply didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Product gave me a rash. I think I may be allergic to it.</li>
    <li> Amazing fresh scent. I just use this one only.</li>
    <li> Prefer the dry white version ;(</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I felt the need to for this product. This could&#x27;ve been something wrong with my anatomy but this product really screwed up my underarms. They broke out and chafed and burn like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. This is more of a gel style deoderant so I think that has something to do with it.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s a product that doesn&#x27;t include aluminum - and it works.  That&#x27;s it!</li>
    <li> This is the first underarm product that provides a long lasting fresh scent even though it&#x27;s not an anti-perspirant.  I can&#x27;t wear anti-perspirant on a daily basis because it irritates my skin pretty badly but with this stuff I don&#x27;t even care.  Even after pretty hard exertion there&#x27;s no bad smell which is not usually the case with products that are just deodorants.  If you have sensitive skin to aluminum zirconate (the active ingredient in anti-perspirant), then I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t stink, my partner tanks me!</li>
    <li> Great product, try it and will love it</li>
    <li> Horrible product. I hated it so much i threw it away. Cakes, rolls off, and doesnt wanna wash off. Thumbs down.</li>
    <li> Smells greats but doesn&#x27;t last as long as advertised.</li>
    <li> I never thought I would find a deodorant I liked better than Mennan Musk Deodorant after using it for 30 years - but I have switched now and don&#x27;t regret my change to Dove Men Deodorant. I can&#x27;t use an antispirant becuase of skin reactions.  I like Dove Men because there is no scnet to interfere with my cologne.</li>
    <li> excellent add on item for the price</li>
    <li> Smells really good but the cool silver is better</li>
    <li> This is a blue-ish color gel deodorant (not a solid white stick), and it makes the skin in my underarms peel and burn. Avoid it!  (I switched back to the traditional white stick deodorant from Dove Men and that works fine.)</li>
    <li> SMELLS AMAZING. got it for my boyfriend - he says it goes on a little wet but clear. He has an odor problem and he said this helps but didnt get rid of the problem completely. a good buy</li>
    <li> No sting, smells good.  I can also recommend Natural Grooming Dusk from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Good product.  It does well not to cause any irritation.  Works good for a deodorant.  Very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> When i first tried this deodorant I was very happy because it smelled clean, not strong and it lasted all day. So I wore it for several months, about 5 to be exact... At first all was well, until I noticed I was getting a bit sore under my arms. But i figured I rubbed it on too hard or something.. Well it got worse and worse, and eventually my skin very suddenly started shedding off skin non-stop. In addition, the underarms became VERY sensitive and I had to apply lotion daily. So be on the lookout for this kind of issue. Since this incident I have switched to Old Spice Artic Force deodorant which has not caused any redness or peeling.</li>
    <li> My favorite deodorant. This 2 pack will save you money as compared to buying them in the stores.</li>
    <li> Some of the reviews of this product refer to it as a gel as opposed to a solid and that has me a little confused.  It is translucent in that if you hold the product portion up to a light it allows some light to pass through it, but not detailed images.  Perhaps the correct term is semitransparent?  Whichever it may be, a \\&quot;gel\\&quot; product is something like this [[ASIN:B008CC48OC Gillette Clear &amp; Refreshing Gel Sport Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant Twin Pack 8 Oz]].  It makes me wonder if some of these reviewers received a different product, or if they are perhaps mistakenly using the word \\&quot;gel\\&quot; to describe this product?  I have never seen or tried a gel version of this deodorant and it may be that some reviews showing here are for a different product.  With that in mind, here&#x27;s my review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer a deodorant to an antiperspirant for daily use.  At the gym I use a spray antiperspirant but find that for normal daily activities a deodorant is sufficient.  I used to always use an antiperspirant daily but I got tired of all the staining left behind on my white undershirts.  This deodorant does not cause undershirt stains and that&#x27;s a big plus in my book.  Also, even if the scientific community is not in agreement, concerns about how aluminum may negatively react with the body are also part of my thought process when it comes to selecting a deodorant product over an antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to switch up deodorants pretty much after every tube was finished.  That wasn&#x27;t necessarily because they weren&#x27;t working for me, but more often than not because I just got tired of the scent and wanted to try something new.  In this Dove Men line I have tried both this Clean Comfort scent and their Extra Fresh scent.  Both scents are nice and refreshing, but of the two I&#x27;ve tried I prefer this Clean Comfort version.  I think it smells more like soap and less like a cologne and I prefer a clean straight forward scent if I am going to have any scent on at all.  This meets that criteria and is appropriately named.  This Clean Scent is now the only deodorant I purchase/use and it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve stuck with a deodorant product for such a long period of time since using Mennen Speed Stick all through high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never encountered any itching, burning or redness as a few of these reviews have reported and I&#x27;ve never gotten through the work day to find this deodorant has become less effective.  Even in the cold of winter I have never encountered any discomfort or found my underarms to be overly dry while using this product.  I also think Dove got it right in terms of the cap design.  In putting this cap on it slides down until it meets a detent position where you can actually feel and hear a bit of a click to let you know you got the cap on securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing about this product that I don&#x27;t like and I&#x27;m glad Dove has gotten into the male grooming product line with these good \\&quot;solid\\&quot; contenders.  Good job Dove!is appropriately named.

    <li> This deodorant was alright, but not great, at keeping me smelling okay. I find &amp;#34;clean comfort&amp;#34; to be a sporty scent. It stopped working for me about halfway through the day. I wanted to try this product, because it was labeled non-irritating. I had originally used Old Spice, for around a year, when I suddenly had an allergic reaction to it. I figured I was allergic to either the aluminum or the zinc. I then switched to Tom&#x27;s deodorant, since it was devoid of both of these. However, Tom&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t compatible with me scent-wise, so I bought some Dove Men+Care &amp;#34;Non-Irritant&amp;#34; Deodorant in Clean Comfort. While this does smell better than the Tom&#x27;s, it is not a non-irritant. I was fine for about a month, then I noticed that I developed a burning sensation while applying this. Shortly thereafter, I had another allergic reaction, complete with redness, itchy bumps, and burning in my underarms. I would not recommend this deodorant to those with sensitive skin/allergies.</li>
    <li> Least irritation and most deodorant action for those of us who make it to the gym and have to put it on, still sweating, after the 2nd shower of the day.</li>
    <li> I use this daily, I don&#x27;t have a very active job so I don&#x27;t need the strong stuff. It last about 8 hours less if your active. It does work on your underarm making it smoother and less build up than antiperspirant/deodorant combos.</li>
    <li> Pleasant, clean straight forward smell, offers good odor protection for about a day, definitely not 48 hour protection. Deodorant goes on clear and I haven&#x27;t experienced any staining with undershirts.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves this stuff...he has sensitive skin and other deodorants can be irritating to him. It keeps his B.O. to a minimum (yay for me!) and it&#x27;s a huge plus that it is not a white solid nor does it have aluminum in it.</li>
    <li> The smell and longevity of this deodorant have made it my go-to option!  I already ordered another so I didn&#x27;t forget which one I liked the most!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes on clean, lasts all day.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin as antiperspirants do at times.  I worked some 20+ hour days over an event in a suit and tie, lasted super well, even with me walking all day and being in the sun!</li>
    <li> My husbands favorite deodorant and the only one he will buy. He has extremely sensitive armpits and can&#x27;t use the white deodorant and it causes irritation and doesn&#x27;t like the gel kind because it makes him feel sticky and wet so the only kind he will use is the clear solid and Dove is one of only 3 brands that I know of that carries it and I can only find 2 brands that I can purchase locally. Out of the 3 brands Dove is the most reasonably priced, easiest to find in stores, and has the best scent. Will continue to buy this over and over.</li>
    <li> This product is great for guys. Has a nice masculine smell. Prior to this, I used to use sent-free deodorant. However, I find this to smell nice and all the guys like the smell.</li>
    <li> mmmmmmmmmmm  smells so nice!!</li>
    <li> My husband and son loves this deodorant. Non irritating and great long lasting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dove deodorant for a couple years now and I&#x27;m still happy with it.  Previously I was using the Dove antiperspirant, but got fed up with the white chalky pit stains that would slowly develop on all of my shirts.  Sure, with stain remover, extra washings, etc, it would come out, but only to simply show up again after a few normal wash cycles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to sweat a lot so I figured I needed an antiperspirant, but wanted to try deodorant to see if it would help with the stains.  It absolutely did.  No more pit stains AND it works just as well as the antiperspirant.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> My last few batches of deodorant have been from Axe... (not the spray) and they smelled nice.  This one smells better and works well.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as described.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Dove products, from bath gel to soap, because of the way it treats my skin.  I&#x27;m a particular fan of this scent because it&#x27;s clean, and mild - it doesn&#x27;t overpower my cologne or any that of other people.  I used the regular solid stick, but thought of trying this one, thinking, &amp;#34;Hey, what could go wrong?&amp;#34;  I got my answer a few days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redness, itchiness, liberal shedding and peeling of skin, sweat buildup due to the deodorant not working at all or being &amp;#34;washed off&amp;#34; the skin with sweat and ending up on my undershirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last straw was today when I felt that my armpits were so itchy it&#x27;s as if they were possessed by Lucifer.  But, not only were they itchy, they were intensely sweaty and it stunk to high heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out, bought the regular solid stick and applied it.  No itching, just like that, and I haven&#x27;t experienced any sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is something wrong with this product.  It took me one hell of an experience to learn that one should pay attention to the reviews.  Do NOT use it unless you have the hide of a rhino.</li>
    <li> I generally love Dove for Men products.  I like their clear application deodorant but accidentally bought this type instead of the one I intended to buy, which is the Extra Fresh version.  This one smells horrible at least when mixed with my natural smell.  Insecticide is an honest version of what it smells like when applied to me.  I recommend you get the Extra Fresh Version.  And if you like Dove Products, try their Clean Defense Body Wash as well, awesome smell that stays with you all day and leaves your skin feeling refreshed!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Its the only deo that doesn&#x27;t give me a rash on my pits. Smells great and lasts all day long. If you put on too much however, it tends to get flaky and hard to wash out.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. Does the job well. My skin gets irritated easily and this hasn&#x27;t caused me any problems yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant exclusively for years now, and I don&#x27;t envision myself changing any time soon. It smells great, but isn&#x27;t overpowering by any means. You have to be very close to smell it, and I&#x27;ve gotten nothing but compliments on the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see a lot of comments about rashes and irritation developing, and I am somewhat surprised to hear that. I have always had sensitive skin, and have had issues with irritation from different brands of deodorant in the past. This one has caused absolutely no discomfort whatsoever. Every person is built differently, I suppose.</li>
    <li> I have been using this deodorant for several months now and am quite pleased with the results.  It&#x27;s got a clean subtle scent that disappears quickly (Yes!) and keeps me dry - a lot better than other deodorants I have tried.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t have some of the nastier chemicals that other deodorants/ antiperspirants have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE REMINDER:  This is a deodorant not an antiperspirant.  If you really need an antiperspirant, this may not be the product for you.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t stink as much.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s to say, it&#x27;s the same product you could buy at Walgreens, but half the price.  No Aluminum or other heavy metals, if you&#x27;re conscious of that sort of thing (and doesn&#x27;t stain white shirts).  Deodorant only, not an antiperspirant.  Clear gel.  One application lasts all day in all but the most hot/sweaty conditions.</li>
    <li> This deodorant does the job. Keeps nasty body odor at bay, and smells pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks after I started using this deodorant, my underarms became extremely sore, and occasionally a rash would show up. Had to discontinue my use of it for that reason.</li>
    <li> AMAZING SMELL... and works great</li>
    <li> It smells great, but I&#x27;ve had nothing but rashes - painful ones too. I do have sensitive skin, but non-irritant isn&#x27;t something that should be advertised if it does nothing but cause irritation. :(</li>
    <li> as it states. non-irritant. the first non white deodorant i&#x27;ve been able to use. Usually i get a rash and my skin peels with anything other than a white stick deodorant.</li>
    <li> My favorite deodorant, doesn&#x27;t leave a mess with a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Works well, keeps my pits from drying out while protecting against perspiration.</li>
    <li> Dove has been a lifelong love of mine. I grew up in a household that used Dove White bar soap and what an outstanding brand. I have been pleased with all of the new Dove products that I have tried. I truly get the sense that Dove has done a lot of research and have created really great things. I would recommend this for men of any age.</li>
    <li> Awesome smell, that provides protection for hours!</li>
    <li> As in all my dove purchases, I am happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Just FYI, this is not the white colored antiperspirant but the gel-like one.&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this if I noticed it before? No.&lt;br /&gt;But I liked it so much, I will not order the white one again and go with this one at least for a while.&lt;br /&gt;It smells fresh, and does not have a powerful smell so it does not interfere with the eau de toilets. (Or I do not have a strong smell sense :) )</li>
</ol>
