<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the product enough to want to reorder. I particularly like the fact that it doe not cause oily skin. My make-up applies evenly. I have noticed a decrease in the appearance of lines. I am concern about exposure to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall rating of 5.</li>
    <li> I have been using Immuderm for about 4 months now and really like the way it feels on my face. I ran out for a few days and really missed it, my face felt dry and tight even if I used another moisturizer in it&#x27;s place. I am told that my complexion looks great so I am pleased with the product. I still see wrinkles but no product is a miracle worker :-). But I will continue using this as long as I can afford it.</li>
    <li> Did not see any real difference from the product I have been using which is Life Cell</li>
    <li> I had a slight reaction to it,so I only use it at night.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really tell yet what I think of product.  Leaves face hard to apply makeup to.</li>
    <li> The product is fading the redness on my throat due to sun damage, which is great. I have tried many products promising to remove redness, but none of them worked until Immuderm. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> Terrific love the product have told many friends about it.  It truly is the best I will use this product forever</li>
    <li> Works as described.  It gets better as time and use in continued.</li>
    <li> Very moisturing for dry hands.</li>
    <li> Great product! Immediate results.</li>
    <li> Great light and easy install.</li>
    <li> Makes a nice face cream/makeup removed probably, but does not work as advertised...it definitely does not lessen age spots or wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a month 1/2 every day I see no changes in my face. I do better with organic coconut oil.</li>
    <li> I love that&#x27;s it&#x27;s all natural and cruelty free.  No animal testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have such sensitive skin, it&#x27;s a rare find to find something that I&#x27;m not allergic to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always looked young for my age, but a couple years ago, I looked in the mirror, and I thought I aged a lot.  I&#x27;m 50 now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definite improvement since I started using this.  When I turned 50, most people were shocked.  I heard, no way ... you look 35. No one believes I&#x27;m 50. One friend asked me how it&#x27;s possible that I look younger.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years, and still love it.  Will use no other!</li>
    <li> Did not see any difference , not worth the money</li>
    <li> Excellent skin cream. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I have used Immuderm Creme for about 8 years. Started purchasing this on Amazon within past 12 months. This particular tube appears old! I added it to last scoop of previous tube which was bright white Creme. What I received recently is muddy tan. Ink printing on box is faded. Unfortunate purchase. The product is usually worthwhile.</li>
    <li> I will continue to use perricine md moisturizer. Immuderm falls short on its promises.!</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS WORTH THE PRICE. IT GOES ON SMOOTHLY AD MAKES&lt;br /&gt; YOUR SKIN SO SOFT.. IT LASTS FOR HOURS AND MAKES YOUR MAKEUP LOOK BETTER.&lt;br /&gt;FOR DRY SKIN LIKE MINE I NEED THE MOISTURE THIS PRODUCT GIVES.</li>
    <li> Its ok just not what I expected.  It is greasy.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  I use it on my hands and face</li>
    <li> you really have to like the product to write something about it.Boyfriend is so sweet smelling that everyone loves it and constantly says I smell good and I like that it isn&#x27;t strong you cant smell it but they can and what can be better than that?</li>
    <li> I used this product religiously morning and night for several months and saw absolutely no change. It might work, but it just didn&#x27;t really do anything for me</li>
    <li> I like it very much I don&#x27;t have any wrinkl I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles a few line really haven&#x27;t seen them disappear yet but its only been 3 week but I think my skin does loo but I think my skin does look bette I&#x27;m happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Very nice products. Using it for a long time and really works. Makes skin look 10 years younger. I am 64 and gladly anyone that does not believe me can ask for my photo. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> I saw a big difference in my skin &amp; I have been using it for 1 year so far.&lt;br /&gt;  Apply it every morning &amp; before bed.It&#x27;s not a heavy cream &amp;not noticeable when on.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m still waiting for the miracle to make my stressed face to look young again.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin soft, gets rid of blemishes and makes me feel better about myself and also my looks</li>
    <li> Shofar I have been very happy with this product.  I&#x27;m on my third tube, it took about three to four weeks to notice a difference but I&#x27; m&lt;br /&gt;Happy with the results.</li>
    <li> My mom tried this for 30 days (my mother is 67).  She saw no improvement. Like a lot of products that promise to help eliminate wrinkles, this one was also a bust.</li>
    <li> Absorbs well with little film left over.</li>
    <li> It was suppose to release the deep creases in my face, using it for a month now with no success.  I will try something else.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an outdoor person who is in the sun a lot.  I use it a.m. and p.m. and it keeps my skin more soft-looking.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many facial creams over the years trying to find the fountian of youth and here it is I have only been using his product for 1 1/2 weeks and I can see an amazing change already. I am in my mid 40&#x27;s and have worshiped the sun for many years thus causing damage to my skin. My fine wrinkles are disappearing and my skin just glows. I would bathe in this stuff if I had enough of it. Really worth the price!</li>
    <li> Could not tell difference.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer was recommended to me by a local medical spa several years ago. I have dry, sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t respond well to most moisturizers. This delivers everything you could ask for. It leaves my skin perfectly moisturized while delivering anti-aging properties. And it does not make me break out. To be honest, I was hesitate to give it rave reviews for fear that it will sell out.</li>
    <li> I think this helps my skin,  wrinkles are slowy disappearing as I use this cream.  Don&#x27;t have to use much either, it&#x27;s very liquid and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> i love it.  well worth the money.  thanks  let me know if you have a special anytime.</li>
    <li> While I initially got this for my face, it is in my hands that I noticed big improvements.  For years they had been red and cracked and I had tried many things to heal them.  Immuderm was wonderful on them and actually healed them.  I use it faithfully and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Guess it worked but I don&#x27;t look 20 years younger or anything. My skin feels nice however.</li>
    <li> this product makes your skin feel soft and more pliable.  ti only took a few days to feel the difference. it will be a part of my anti-aging regiment from now on.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what others have experienced but I got this for my mother and myself and both of us noticed a difference in one week. I&#x27;m 40 and my mother is 66. I use it on my face, neck and hands. My mother uses it on her face, neck and arms. The difference in our skin texture is so amazing. Soft, less wrinkled, fresh and awake. We&#x27;ve had people comment how we look different. More well rested and soft. We both recommend it and will continue using it!</li>
    <li> This has worked better than other skin creams to soften my skin and provide good skin tone for my skin.</li>
    <li> Would recommend to anyone interested in improving &#x27;aging&#x27; skin :)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I live in Colorado where it is very dry and this is the best moisturizer I have found!!</li>
    <li> Cleared up age warts that were developing on my neck. Reduces irritation from insect bites. Helps maintain general skin health.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 months now and see now difference.  It also leaves my skin feeling like I need to put lotion on.  It is not what I expected.</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks of use, I had skin breakout problems.  Immuderm did not absorb into skin.  Stayed &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; on skin.  Tried to return item after 3 weeks and was turned down.  Check out 3rd party return policy.</li>
    <li> I believe Immuderm holds up to what is advertised.  It diminishs the wrinkles.  I have used other moisturizers and this one has been better than any so far.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good enough story I just HAD to give it a try!  There was a Swedish woman named Ingrid (I think) who was a Single Mom.  She had been naturally beautiful, but the hard years hadn&#x27;t been very kind to her.  She was in her mid 40&#x27;s, raising her daughters with 2 and sometimes 3 jobs-making ends meat as best as she could.  She cleaned out fish tanks in the evenings, at a bio-chemical lab.  After a few weeks, she couldn&#x27;t help but notice that whatever was in the water of the fish tanks, was remarkably improving the appearance of her skin on her hands &amp; arms.  So she started taking a little bit home, in a bottle, to put on her face.  It didn&#x27;t take long for people to begin to notice &amp; want to know her secret.  Had she found the &amp;#34;Fountain of Youth&amp;#34;?  Finally, she swore her best friend, Uma, to secrecy &amp; told her where she found her magic potion.  She didn&#x27;t think sharing just a little of the water with Uma would be too much.  But it didn&#x27;t take long for her to realize that she had a dilema.  So many of her friends &amp; family had noticed the difference.  She knew she couldn&#x27;t drain the fish tanks to supply them all with whatever was in the water.  And being an honest woman, her conscience told her she needed to tell her boss what she had been doing.  But she wasn&#x27;t sure how he would react.  She approached him one evening, and as she shared her story with him, he looked at her with a perplexing look on his face.  When she finished, he didn&#x27;t say a word, for what seemed like the longest time.  Uh oh.  What was he thinking?  Was he angry?  Was he going to fire her?  Then all of a sudden he exclaimed, &amp;#34;Of course&amp;#34;!  Being a chemist, he had listened intently &amp; was also surmising that he too noticed a difference in her skin, as he was listening to her story.  Then he realized that the chemical components of what they put in the water, to keep the fish&#x27;s skin healthy was obviously working for her too.  Well, there&#x27;s more to the story, that involved doing a study,comprised of Uma &amp; the rest of Ingrids friends  family.  Uma didn&#x27;t want to agree to putting it on only one side of her face.  But to be in the study, that was the deal!  Eventually Immuderm was created &amp; it has taken over the market in Sweden, where some of the most beautiful women in the world are from.  And it is slowly working it&#x27;s way into the market here, in America.  You will be glad you found it!  Oh, and Ingrid no longer cleans out fish tanks, since she receives royalties on ecery bottle sold.  And her friends &amp; family hit the jackpot too, by receiving free Immuderm for life as well!  I&#x27;ve been putting it on my shoulders, where I have some sun damage too, and so far so good!</li>
    <li> Best skin product I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> I like the way my face feels when I use Immuderm. It&#x27;s like giving my skin a drink of water! Love it!</li>
    <li> It is too soon to tell.  I believe one needs to use this product for a few weeks to really learn if it works!</li>
    <li> The cream is thick and gives me a sense of skin protection.  I have just used it for a couple of weeks and like it.</li>
    <li> I used this cream some time ago and stopped when I went I back to UK. I had forgotten how great it is and what a difference it made to my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sue that I;m having any wondrous effects after 3 wks usage</li>
    <li> The morning after I had received the product-Immuderm I looked into the mirror as soon as I got up and was amazed.  I have been looking for&lt;br /&gt;a product that would take the bag out of my eye.  This particular bag under my left eye was like a deflated piece of flesh astoundedly noticed by myself more than anyone else but still a noticable flaw discomfited to me.  Immuderm had lifted my bag.  There is a distinct color distortion under my eye, which I  am assuming is there because of the bag.  This is my fourth day.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m going to make progress with the discoloration and yes that bag is gone.  i have tried many products for over a decade, and none had worked but i couldn&#x27;t believe that only after maybe 3 application within less than 24 hours my bag diminished.  i&#x27;m wirking on the sagging skin on my arms, the liver spots on both hands and the edema spots on my legs, ankles and tops of my feet. i hope I&#x27;m not expecting to much, but  I feel confident.  its as if I fell into &amp;#34;A Puddle of Youth&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel really good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this as a moisturizer for three years. I think it&#x27;s absolutely fabulous! The price for a whopping 6 ounces of product is almost unheard of for something that has great results!</li>
    <li> I really like this and have found my face it much softer.  Isn&#x27;t greasy at all and will buy more when I run out or before I run out. Very happy!!</li>
    <li> I use this as an aftershave. It doesn&#x27;t take much, so it will last a very long time - maybe 6 months or so. That makes it very affordable.</li>
    <li> Slight reduction of dark spots after a few months use.</li>
    <li> I would probably want to use this product for a few months to give an honest review.  I have only been using it for approximately 1 month.  Will add more comments after I have used it for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> I had very high hopes for this product, but so far no noticeable change in my skin--wrinkles are as deep and visible as ever. I don&#x27;t remember exactly when I bought it, but maybe I haven&#x27;t used it for 30 days yet--which is the recommended twice-daily application. It does seem to be a decent moisturizer, so I&#x27;ll keep using it until the tube is gone.</li>
    <li> This is a luscious moisturizing cream that seems to plump skin so wrinkles are minimized. I say minimized because I can still see a faint line of forehead wrinkle at age 64. And that&#x27;s good.  My skin does look healthier, not dried out. I like this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a few years now and I would hate to run out.  I am 85 years young, my skin is in better condition than when I was much younger. I spent so much time in the sun, had so much to repair on my face.  I spent a lot of years in the hay field helping my husband, so you can imagine what the sun did to my skin. Now it is so soft. Love it!</li>
    <li> Did not impress me at all</li>
    <li> I am applying Immuderm daily, AM and PM, am observing closely minor improvement, but will continue to be applying daily.</li>
    <li> Product did not work as big as promised.  Not any better than my previous products used.  I will not need anymore.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I really notice a difference in my skin, keeps my wrinkles away and my skin hydrated. Have been using it for over a year now, wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for years, I am now 63 and my skin has never been softer or smoother. Try it out, you will  not regret your purchase.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> It is a very nice moisturizing cream.  I haven&#x27;t seen any wrinkle reduction as of today. But, there is always hope!</li>
    <li> My wife says this cream works wonders!</li>
    <li> Great product and the cheapest I have ever found it.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping and amazing product! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Product met my expectations. My skin is smoother, however, to date, Immuderm has had no impact on small facial lines. Clearly, Immuderm has improved the quality of my skin, which is what I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> Stay with it, in about 2 weeks you with see a difference!</li>
    <li> I bought this with expectations of it getting my skin back to the smooth even texture I had just a few years ago.  My skin was always a smooth olive color with no problems until I hit somewhere in the mid 50&#x27;s and suddenly all these age spots or dark spots started showing up and it seemed nothing I tried was working.  I am constantly searching for the latest and greatest product on the market and do not always buy them but I have tried a few things that sounded like they would work.  Nothing did until I found this Immuderm.  I started using on my face, neck and chest and only recently started using on my arms since I was having such good results with the face.  I had one particular dark spot on my face that was getting worse until I started using this Immuderm and now it is getting lighter and lighter every day.  My chest and neck are seeing good results too with some of the lighter spots already gone and working on the others.  My arms saw results within days.  Barely any red pigmentation left and all of the little bumpy areas are gone.  I would love to use it on my legs and rest of the body but too expensive for that.  May be when they lower the price (hopefully that happens), I can use it everywhere.  Now all they need is a good bath soap or shower soap and I am set.  Hey Immuderm people...Let&#x27;s have some body or shower soap!!!</li>
    <li> This is a must have skin care after 40, It will melt years off and it feels great......</li>
    <li> I just love it and I save money buying it at Amazon. Thanks. Maria</li>
    <li> saw no difference in 4 weeks</li>
    <li> I should have paid more attention to the previous reviews posted. I have been using this product for 4 weeks. I see no significant difference in my skin tone.  Additionally, there were no return instructions included with the purchase.  Please advise!</li>
    <li> One of the best face creams around - wouldn&#x27;t consider changing.</li>
    <li> I have used this product through various name changes dictated by the FDA even though it is the same product.</li>
    <li> The product seemed to make my complexion smoother after about 1 week, as promised.  Other people noticed . . I was asked what I was using!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product for very long but so far, so good.  I hope after a few months I will notice an even better outcome with its use.</li>
    <li> I believe the cream is working. I need to use it loner to make a clear review. My skin looks good but need wait and see more of a change. The price was right.</li>
    <li> I usually do not believe advertising but I go sucked in once again. Not only did  it not do what it said it would do,it made my skin all paste like and dull. There is a money back guarantee but I doubt I would ever get it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because some friends of mine used it and swore to me that it reduced their wrinkles and dark spots. It is very expensive but goes a long way so a 6 ounce tube will last for months. It is really too soon to see much improvement but it goes on smoothly and leaves my face and back of my hands very soft. Time will tell if it actually reverses any of the aging process.</li>
    <li> This product just did not work for me. I had read previous reviews and was hoping that the longer I used it, I would begin to see better results, but I have not and have almost finished the tube. It does not absorb into my skin well even if I use a small amount and has done nothing for my wrinkles. I would not buy it again. I have seen no improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best creams I&#x27;ve ever used. Beta glucans are the key to healing and wrinkle-reduction. I have been using them for years. I highly recommend this formulation from Immuderm.</li>
    <li> This product may be good for your normal skin that is not sensitive or needs moisturizing, but my skin is dry and sensitive to fragrances. It worked okay on the wrinkles, but opened my pores too much.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Was alerted to it by a little book on the product&#x27;s history and could hardly wait to try it.&lt;br /&gt;It lives up to all expectations for me!</li>
    <li> My skin seems a little smoothers, but I also use other products on top pf immuderm. No visible changes in the wrinkle lines yet.</li>
    <li> This is my third order of this cream.  It&#x27;s great for lessening wrinkles and it doesn&#x27;t cause any break outs.  I get complements all the time with people thinking I am 10 to 15 years younger than I am.</li>
    <li> This is very good product and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it quite restores youth - ha! - but it does feel good on and makes a good substitute for some other &amp;#34;night cream,&amp;#34; I think. Considering the lofty price, it&#x27;s very important that a little goes a long way, or seems to, and only on that basis would I buy another.</li>
    <li> This works pretty good for me.  I don&#x27;t think anything will actually take away wrinkles but this makes mine look smaller anyway.</li>
    <li> Nice cream, haven&#x27;t seen any difference, but it&#x27;s non greasy and smells good.</li>
    <li> An all in one &amp;#34;Strivectin&amp;#34; type of product.  I do see results and it is a lot less trouble and expense than a surgical procedure.</li>
    <li> I was please as to how they product moisturized my skin but did not see much improvement in the tightness of my skin.</li>
    <li> Loved the product..took redness from skin on hands and face!  Believe my wrinkles on my face  are better also. Would highly recommend product!</li>
    <li> From reading the reviews I expected more.  I like the cream, but it is not doing what I thought it would do.  Sorry</li>
    <li> Best face product ever</li>
    <li> Expected more noticeable results by now. I will have to use it a little longer to see if there is a change in skin condition</li>
    <li> hoping it will improve my immunity.  Taking 2 caps 3 times a day this winter.</li>
    <li> All my friends are now using it after they saw what a difference it did with my skin.  I look 10 years younger from using it.&lt;br /&gt;sk</li>
    <li> So far I am very satisfied with this product, wish you carried more like their wrinkle cream and other products they offer.</li>
    <li> Was quite skeptical but curious, and the reviews looked positive, and the price was right.  I have tried so many anti aging products that are okay, but do not really deliver.  Most work by exfoliating and stimulating, making my skin always on the defensive.  This product works differently by assisting the skin&#x27;s immune process.  At least that is my understanding.  The skin on my face looks great!  At first, I used it along with my other products, but now I use it alone.  I also started putting it in places where my skin was getting saggy, backs of hands, thighs.  They say your skin starts to &amp;#34;act young&amp;#34;.  That is it.  Some little bumps went away and stopped itching, and a scar from a bug bite is dissolving.  I have ordered some for my husband who will not use vanity creams, but somehow is managing to use this without my urging.  The more we use it, the more we use it!  Definitely a keeper if the price stays as reasonable as it is.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Been using it about a month now, my skin&#x27;s texture and tone have improved and my well established brown spots seem to be fading.&lt;br /&gt;Only possible drawback I live in Texas and I seem to sweat more with this cream, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I think it is working. Have been using it now off and on for a few weeks. I am 56, and it is making my neck look younger and is helping my face more than prescription retin A. I also am using it on the backs of my hands and forearms. The brown spots are fading and the skin looks more youthful. I will definitely keep buying it.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. Love it. No fancy packaging, no hype. Just an excellent daily moisturizer. Not heavy, great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t yet tell if it is really making a difference, but i think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> This is my second tube and I am satisfied with the product. It tends to be a bit heavy on  the skin so I just use it at night.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.  It is sticky and doesn&#x27;t even moisturize your skin.  Just sits there.  BOO!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
    <li> Immuderm cream is a cream I have used for two years or more.  I am very happy with it. Ellen Hollister</li>
