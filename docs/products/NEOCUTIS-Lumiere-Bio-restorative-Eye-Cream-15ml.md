      <li>It&#x27;s waaaaay more affordable on Amazon than anywhere else.  </li>
      <li>and i was hesitant about this, but belive me its a miracle, my eyes look fresher and even better then in my 20s</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>I love the Neocutis Lumier Cio-restorative Eye Cream and re-ordered it  through Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>It helps to moisturize the skin around my eyes (top and bottom lids).</li>
      <li>ok..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my 30s &amp; have pretty good skin</li>
      <li>But it also provided more relief of my fine lines and puffiness.  </li>
      <li>My crows feet and fine lines around my eyes are significantly better.  </li>
      <li>As for the ingredients, I suggest you go to the neocutis website where you will find more accurate information about the technology and research that goes into this product.</li>
      <li>- the cap falls off easily  </li>
      <li>- the cap breaks easily     </li>
      <li>I used to use a separate eye serum and eye cream for the fine lines and puffiness, but now I just use the Lumiere.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to like it because I paid so much for the Lumere(I like the name) and the packaging is nice.</li>
      <li>Wonderful product,you use very little at a time</li>
      <li>have diminished  - good for upper lids and under eyes  - doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes    </li>
      <li>It made ordering so easy since I had purchased  the product at the dermatologists office in the first place.  </li>
      <li>After using up my first bottle (I paid $75 at her office), I am coming back for more!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really excited to find this product on Amazon at a price much lower than my dermatologist was charging.</li>
      <li>Oh well, small potatoes, it is a great product</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad to find it finally on the market at a lower price.  </li>
      <li>I used it exactly as told.</li>
      <li>The following day, the circles were more wrinkled then ever.</li>
      <li>It makes sense that cells would produce more cells and actually repair the skin, so I gave it a shot.  </li>
      <li>But I can&#x27;t be sure as it was so long ago.      </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen much of a difference.</li>
      <li>This cream really does lighten the un-lightenable.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll spend that much money on this again.</li>
      <li>More recently, I saw some info on my dermatologist&#x27;s website about a couple of products that she offers, and I asked about them during an office visit.  </li>
      <li>and it did reduce the darkness more than other products I had used.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have fine lines,  but loose skin under and over the eyes.  </li>
      <li>This product was highly recommended by my dermotologist and has performed fantastically.  </li>
      <li>I really expected to because I&#x27;m at the point where I just have \\&quot;fine lines.\\</li>
      <li>I contacted his nurse who suggested I give it a little more time.</li>
      <li>I almost look like a normal person instead of something from the raccoon family.    </li>
      <li>Very pleased and the cost of the same product purchased online vs. the cost directly from the Doctor&#x27;s office is significantly less.</li>
      <li>the next morning I went right to the bathroom</li>
      <li>It helps with the puffiness, too, but not as significantly as the dark circles.  </li>
      <li>Never had bags around my eyes before- huge bags and very dark circles.  </li>
      <li>I really want to use the whole line of products, but they are a lot more expensive.  </li>
      <li>, tried every product at sephora and nordstroms, spoke to dermatologists, paid too much money for skin care professionals to do some false treatment and tell me I need to drink more water and reduce my stress.  </li>
      <li>I have NO dark circles, always looking refreshed.  </li>
      <li>and my wrinkles are barely noticeable.  </li>
      <li>They must have a ridiculous amount of free time.</li>
      <li>I noticed that my barely-there fine lines were now turning into wrinkles (due to the 15 years of heavy smoking).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard good things about this product and it can be very expensive.  </li>

<li> I did notice a slight difference in the brightness around the lower and upper eye</li>
<li> My paternal grandmother had such severe black circles all around her</li>
<li> It&#x27;s on their website, I&#x27;m really not making this up.  </li>
<li> Before I spent $1,000 on laser treatment, the woman asked if I have been using Lumiere (as if \\&quot;everyone\\&quot; was using it).  </li>
<li> Dont be fulled by other revews, you have to try this for yourself.</li>
<li> Anyhow, to make a long story short, I got so desperate to get rid of these wrinkles that I went for a consultaion with a laser skin care professional.  </li>
<li> I found that it minimized my dark circles (though did not eliminate them) as well as the Hylexin.  </li>
<li> I believe it reduces dark circles and puffiness.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had dark circles since I was in my teens (which was 30-some years ago).  </li>
<li> but if it slows down the aging process for me then there is nothing I wont try.</li>
<li> But when it comes down to it, it&#x27;s all just pennies at my age (47).</li>
<li> After a few days of use, my eyes became extremely puffy and irritated.</li>
<li> I plan to try the cream for the entire face, but my eyes were my worst problem and the eye cream was the most affordable.</li>
<li> - expensive  - hard to administer the right amount (it calls for half a pump, so why not just create a pump that administers the correct amount?)  </li>
<li> and for a few hours after,  my eyes look firmer and feel tighter.  </li>
<li> Nothing has ever eliminated them, but a few years ago</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it day and night for a few weeks , though, and don&#x27;t see any noticeable improvement in wrinkles or lines.  </li>
<li> Buy something less expensive in your local drugstore,and don&#x27;t waste your money on this product</li>
<li> That&#x27;s pretty sick.</li>
<li> The people with negative reviews on this cream have never used the cream, so I am not sure why they are even bothering to comment.  </li>
<li> It was slightly less expensive than the Hylexin (even at the doctor&#x27;s marked-up price).  </li>
<li> The jury is still out on whether my eyes have become addicted to this.</li>
<li> After another day, it was even worse.</li>
<li> but I don&#x27;t see any dramatic changes after a month of using it.  </li>
<li> I bought this (fairly expensive) eye cream from my dermatologists office.  </li>
<li> I started using Hylexin (another expensive product)</li>
<li> Sorry to all those who rant about what is in this product....... call me vain</li>
<li> It was expensive and</li>
<li> PS sorry for my spelling</li>
<li> Of course it got really bad when my wedding came around.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years now - paying a fortune for it at the dermatologist.  I&#x27;m so glad to find it finally on the market at a lower price.  It has all but eliminated the wrinkles and bags under my eyes.  I use a dab morning and evening and LOVE it!</li>
    <li> A complete waste of my money. After a few days of use, my eyes became extremely puffy and irritated.</li>
    <li> The product does make the skin around your eyes feel good, moist and enriched.  I&#x27;ve been using it day and night for a few weeks , though, and don&#x27;t see any noticeable improvement in wrinkles or lines.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll spend that much money on this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve learned about this product through my dermatologist.  I only use this cream once before bedtime and I love it.  It helps to moisturize the skin around my eyes (top and bottom lids).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard good things about this product and it can be very expensive.  I did notice a slight difference in the brightness around the lower and upper eye maybe 2 weeks after I started using it.  But you have to use it enough to see the difference.  When you stop using it, the eye area returns back to the way it was before.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on eye creams &amp; this one was recommended by In Style magazine. I&#x27;m in my 30s &amp; have pretty good skin but I&#x27;m noticing signs of aging, especially around my eyes. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen much of a difference. I really expected to because I&#x27;m at the point where I just have \\&quot;fine lines.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve been using it for several months &amp; should have seen a difference by now.    It was expensive and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d purchase it again. I&#x27;m going to finish using the bottle &amp; then look for something else.</li>
    <li> My dermotologist suggested I try this. I used it exactly as told. The following day, the circles were more wrinkled then ever. I contacted his nurse who suggested I give it a little more time. After another day, it was even worse. I couldn&#x27;t believe it! Went back to the doctor and told me to stop using the product immediately. This product did more damage than good. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Sorry to all those who rant about what is in this product....... call me vain but if it slows down the aging process for me then there is nothing I wont try.</li>
    <li> I have try all of them, the priciest ones and i was hesitant about this, but belive me its a miracle, my eyes look fresher and even better then in my 20s( im 35). Dont be fulled by other revews, you have to try this for yourself. Keep in mind your age thought, is not a doctor in the botle but prety close. PS sorry for my spelling but you get the point</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks and when it is applied. and for a few hours after,  my eyes look firmer and feel tighter.  When the product is not on my skin,  my eyes look the same as they always do.  I don&#x27;t have fine lines,  but loose skin under and over the eyes.  I was hoping that I&#x27;d see some permanent results.</li>
    <li> I have always had puffy eyes and in recent years, I&#x27;ve noticed the darkness under them is getting harder and harder to fight with drugstore brand eye creams.  My paternal grandmother had such severe black circles all around her eyes-- I knew I was dealing with an inherited demon.  I asked my dermatologist if there was ANYTHING on the market that would lighten my circles and she suggested this.  After using up my first bottle (I paid $75 at her office), I am coming back for more!  This cream really does lighten the un-lightenable.  It helps with the puffiness, too, but not as significantly as the dark circles.  I almost look like a normal person instead of something from the raccoon family.    As for the ingredients, I suggest you go to the neocutis website where you will find more accurate information about the technology and research that goes into this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dark circles since I was in my teens (which was 30-some years ago).  Nothing has ever eliminated them, but a few years ago I started using Hylexin (another expensive product) and it did reduce the darkness more than other products I had used.  More recently, I saw some info on my dermatologist&#x27;s website about a couple of products that she offers, and I asked about them during an office visit.  She recommended Lumiere by Neocutis and I bought some.  It was slightly less expensive than the Hylexin (even at the doctor&#x27;s marked-up price).  I found that it minimized my dark circles (though did not eliminate them) as well as the Hylexin.  But it also provided more relief of my fine lines and puffiness.  I used to use a separate eye serum and eye cream for the fine lines and puffiness, but now I just use the Lumiere.  I&#x27;m really excited to find this product on Amazon at a price much lower than my dermatologist was charging.</li>
    <li> This is the best skin product that I have ever used.  My crows feet and fine lines around my eyes are significantly better.  The people with negative reviews on this cream have never used the cream, so I am not sure why they are even bothering to comment.  They must have a ridiculous amount of free time.</li>
    <li> So I turned 30 this year and...well...I noticed that my barely-there fine lines were now turning into wrinkles (due to the 15 years of heavy smoking).  I actually started to notice my wrinkles after I quit smoking.  My skin went through a \\&quot;yuck\\&quot; stage for about 9 months.  Of course it got really bad when my wedding came around.  I researched everything, tried every product at sephora and nordstroms, spoke to dermatologists, paid too much money for skin care professionals to do some false treatment and tell me I need to drink more water and reduce my stress.  Yeah...ok..I drink 64oz of water a day...that aint the problem! Anyhow, to make a long story short, I got so desperate to get rid of these wrinkles that I went for a consultaion with a laser skin care professional.  Before I spent $1,000 on laser treatment, the woman asked if I have been using Lumiere (as if \\&quot;everyone\\&quot; was using it).  I told her I&#x27;d get back to her on my decision to laser and focused my research on Lumiere eye cream.  It makes sense that cells would produce more cells and actually repair the skin, so I gave it a shot.  It&#x27;s waaaaay more affordable on Amazon than anywhere else.  I have been using it for 3 weeks and my wrinkles are barely noticeable.  I really want to use the whole line of products, but they are a lot more expensive.  All in all, this has been my saving grace.  My skin is glowing with hydration.  I have NO dark circles, always looking refreshed.  A new coworker told me I looked 23 the other day!  I&#x27;m never using another eye cream.  I feel like FINALLY!</li>
    <li> Pros:      - gives my saggy upper eyelid a visible and instant lift   - decreases puffiness  - a little goes a long way  - after months of use my crows feet have diminished  - good for upper lids and under eyes  - doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes    Cons:    - expensive  - hard to administer the right amount (it calls for half a pump, so why not just create a pump that administers the correct amount?)  - the cap falls off easily  - the cap breaks easily     The jury is still out on whether my eyes have become addicted to this. It seems when I skip using this my upper lids are saggier then I remember.  But I can&#x27;t be sure as it was so long ago.      I have bought this product twice and fully intend to buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this (fairly expensive) eye cream from my dermatologists office.  Before bed that night, I eagerly ripped open the package and carefully applied the product around my eyes...the next morning I went right to the bathroom mirror-- Yikes! Never had bags around my eyes before- huge bags and very dark circles.  Hopped a flight that morning and all through the day my eyes were watering uncontrollably.     Not a winner.      http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R90QOY/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_img</li>
    <li> Now I&#x27;m kicking myself! Why did I take so long to try this product? Well, I finally did. After a week&#x27;s use, Neucutis&#x27; Lumiere eye cream has relaxed the crow&#x27;s feet and the expression lines on my face!!! I am so happy because my skin was going downhill. I plan to try the cream for the entire face, but my eyes were my worst problem and the eye cream was the most affordable. But when it comes down to it, it&#x27;s all just pennies at my age (47). Thank you neocutis!</li>
    <li> This cream and others made by Neocutis are made using the cells from aborted fetuses.  It&#x27;s on their website, I&#x27;m really not making this up.  That&#x27;s pretty sick.</li>
    <li> I love the Neocutis Lumier Cio-restorative Eye Cream and re-ordered it  through Amazon.com.  It made ordering so easy since I had purchased  the product at the dermatologists office in the first place.  I thought  I might end up having to go back to the doctor to get this product, but  not the case.  Love, Love, Love the product.</li>
    <li> I like this eye cream but I don&#x27;t see any dramatic changes after a month of using it.  Nothing in the promotional material said how long the product takes to work.  So, I&#x27;m still waiting.</li>
    <li> This product was highly recommended by my dermotologist and has performed fantastically.  Very pleased and the cost of the same product purchased online vs. the cost directly from the Doctor&#x27;s office is significantly less.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product,you use very little at a time but I wish I could tell how much is left in the container. Oh well, small potatoes, it is a great product and I DO NOT have any affiliation with the Company.</li>
    <li> This eye cream provides moisture, but it is not greasy. I put it on at night and in the mornings (I wear my eye make up over it). I believe it reduces dark circles and puffiness.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from my doctor. The office price was more than Amazon, of course. My doctor told me this was the best so I faithfully used it for maybe a year. I noticed not even the slightest improvement. I wanted to like it because I paid so much for the Lumere(I like the name) and the packaging is nice. Well, this product simply did not work for me.</li>
    <li> results as indicated not so. Buy something less expensive in your local drugstore,and don&#x27;t waste your money on this product</li>
</ol>
