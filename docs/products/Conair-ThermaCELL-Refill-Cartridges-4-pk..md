<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best way to curl on the go..and I&#x27;ve found it diffucult ti find the refills in the store...i love Amazon.</li>
    <li> Work great with the curler. Good price</li>
    <li> This is a great hot roller for travel. The cartridges last a reasonable amount of time. No need to worry about an electrical outlet.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy.It heat&#x27;s up fast and hot.Great for that on the go person and quick fix to your hair.</li>
    <li> These work as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have thick coarse black hair and this does the trick after I flat iron&lt;br /&gt;my hair to give it nice body. I haven&#x27;t been able to find the refills&lt;br /&gt;because I own several curling irons. Great for traveling.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these cartridges in local stores so I was delighted to obtain them on Amazon. The price was right and they arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> love these and the portable curling irons they go with</li>
    <li> I have gotten these before.  They are sorely needed if you still have a curler that takes them because they are hard to find. I am glad I found them and at a good price too!</li>
    <li> The Conair Thermal curler with additional refills is one of the best travel purchases I have made in a long time.  The curler heats up quickly. Upon end of use, the curler can be immediately put away in its carrying case - no waiting for cool down.  The therma cartridge comes off, so no chance of accidentally leaving curler on.</li>
    <li> This is a lot easier than traveling with a US curling iron and wondering if it will work, no worry about plugs-easy, easy product to order and use</li>
    <li> The cartridges that were indicated to be used with the curling iron I also bought are not the correct ones.  Very frustrating!</li>
    <li> Perfect. Would buy again and again.</li>
    <li> This product was purchased because I wanted spares for the Conair Tc701. They are easy to use, but I don&#x27;t know if they control the heat correctly.</li>
    <li> I love this product  I have been using them for years   glad I could get at amaxon  my other sourse does not sell anymore    Patti anastasi</li>
    <li> Met my spectations and I was very satisfied.  All I can say, is they are doing great.  Fit my Curler just fine.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED CONAIR THERMA CURLING IRONS BEFORE..I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ONE FOR A LONG TIME, UNTIL I FOUND THIS ON AMAZON. PLUS I GOT  THE ADDED ADVANTAGE OF PURCHASING REFILLS AT AN EXCELLENT PRICE. THEY ARE WONDERFUL AND I THANK THIS COMPANY TO CARRY THEM AND SHIP THEM SO QUICKLY TO ME, PACKAGED BEAUTIFULLY. YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISSAPOINTED.  MY HUSBAND AND RIDE A HARLEY AND WHEN I TAKE MY HELMET OFF MY HAIR IS FLAT. I CARRY THIS WITH ME AND CAN \\&quot;PUMP\\&quot; UP MY HAIR IMMEDIATELY!!  I REALIZE THIS IS A RATING ON THE REFILLS, BUT THEY ARE A MUST HAVE PRODUCT TO USE WITH THE CONAIR THERMA CURLING IRON. THANK YOU!!!</li>
    <li> A must have for your portable curling iron! The stores don&#x27;t sell the refills anymore anywhere. You can still buy the curling irons but not the refills. I love my cordless iron and plan to order more when I run low on cartridges.</li>
    <li> I used the flat iron as a modified cordless iron.  Each cell lasts 4 - 5 hours of continual use.</li>
    <li> I love my curling irons! They are extremely handy.  It is a shame these are no longer found in stores. I am throughly glad that I was able to find them here!!!!!!</li>
    <li> No problem with these... worked with my tiny Conair straightener as described.  What more can I say?  A good deal.</li>
    <li> These fit great in the curling iron, they do not leak at all and they last quite a good while. They are well constructed from sturdy plastic and very easily installed</li>
    <li> anything for my portable flat iron :)</li>
    <li> I have used these thermacells for years in cordless curlers.  It is so much easier to use them than fight with a corded appliance and they deliver just as much heat ( and I have hard to curl hair).</li>
    <li> Gee, can&#x27;t do without these cartridges for my Conair Curling Iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend you have plenty of these on hand for those last minute / spare of the moment opportune times for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I once was invited for a weekend retreat . . . and you guested it; I left my extra cartridges at home.  All I had was the 1/8 propane liquid left in the curling iron.  It lasted almost 2 days and it was gone.  Surely taught me a lesson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore; I&#x27;ve ordered this 4-pack and I&#x27;m placing two of them in my spare travel case . . . for those future last minute invitations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, don&#x27;t be caught; as I was, without a spare.  I&#x27;ve used the Conair since the early 1990&#x27;s and am so happy with it.  These cartridges (2) usually lasts me up to a whole year.  Of course, I have short hair and all I curl is the top, side of face, and over the ears.  Once in a while I&#x27;ll curl the Crown area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy, it&#x27;s fun, and within 5 minutes you are done!!!  You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have used these on my last 5 trips to Haiti and to places in Europe.  I loove them.  Everyone I travel with wants a curling iron like these.    My cartridges  lasted a long time.  J K</li>
    <li> The wive likes the hairbender they are for very much and she wants to order them again once she used the ones she has up.</li>
    <li> More people should try using this type of curler and cartridge.  Superfast, lasts a long time, hot and cordless.  You can do your hair anywhere!</li>
    <li> Unable to find these cartridges in stores so am so pleased to be able to order them from Amazon and receive them so quickly.</li>
    <li> They worked great. Unfortunately, I bought them because I was going to Europe and knew my electric curling iron wouldn&#x27;t work there. You can not take gas cartridges in your luggage. I found that out later.  I will use them here.</li>
    <li> work great with my haircurler. always heat up very quickly and shut down as soon as u put the cover on</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.  Could not find these in any store.  I take this curling iron camping and have had the iron for over 10 years.  What a miracle to find the butane cartridges and fast delivery too!!</li>
    <li> used daily, they work great!</li>
    <li> great product and seller</li>
    <li> These cartridges are impossible to find locally, I was happy to be able to find them on line..  The thermacell curling iron&lt;br /&gt;apparently isn&#x27;t so popular, but I like it, and I&#x27;ll be ordering more of the cartridges when I run out.</li>
    <li> Most stores have discontinued carrying this item and I wish that were not so.  I use this iron a lot and it works well.</li>
    <li> I love these cartridges because it allows my curling iron to be cordless. The work great, I am stocking up.</li>
    <li> The Conair curling iron cartridges work just as well. Problem is, when everyone started using the Conair cartridges, the prices got jacked up to match the ThermaCell cartridges.</li>
    <li> I love these for my flat iron and my curling iron.  Great for traveling, the office or anywhere you need a touch up.</li>
    <li> I always order these from Amazon.  You can&#x27;t find them in stores, and I have two curling irons that need them.  I have used them for 20+ years, and couldn&#x27;t get along without them on touch-ups, and on trips.  I just think they are awesome.</li>
    <li> I have a heated hair brush that uses these.  In traveling to Europe I do not have to use a converter and risk burning it out, it is powered by these.  And there is no problem taking them through luggage inspections or customs.</li>
    <li> product is really nice. was hard to find for awhile. makes it so easy to curl my hair when we&#x27;re camping.wish i could find one that straightened my had.</li>
    <li> These little cartridges last a long time - so the curling iron that I bought for a gift should stay running for a long time.</li>
    <li> Our delivery was delayed because of mailing requirements with the US Post Office.  The company rectified the problem and sent us a e-mail stating the problem, what they had done to fix the problem, the new expected time of delivery and a bonus of extry cartridges to make up for our inconvience. We were very pleased with their honesty and quick solution to the problem.</li>
    <li> My curling iron is at least 15 years old. I originally bought it for overseas travel. Didn&#x27;t use it for a while and then went back to it. I checked Amazon for the cartridges and crossed my fingers that these would fit. They did fit and lasted several years. I just had to buy new ones</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found this product again.  It&#x27;s handy and works great.  I never have to panic if I&#x27;m low either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution, however, do make sure the off button is pressed and stays off as otherwise all the fuel will silently leak out!</li>
    <li> These came quick and are as pictured. They seem to be exactly what I ordered. Great value for the item as well.</li>
    <li> I love my cordless hair curler but butane cartridges are hard to find in local stores. Thank you amazon.com for making them available. Carole from Vero Beach</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been looking for these for my wife&#x27;s curling iron.  Decided to look on Amazon, and bingo ---- they had them.  Good for a finicky wife, when you have a power outage and the electric curling irons are done for the day.</li>
    <li> Glad to have a steady source for these.  Haven&#x27;t used a plug-in curling iron in years.</li>
    <li> Love these for travel!</li>
    <li> This hard to find item is great-- just what I wanted</li>
    <li> Conair ThermaCELL Refill Cartridges 4-pk are a must in  supplies for my  hair.  I have two different size curling irons where energy is supplied by these cartridges and it works beautifully.  They are so handy to have and in a minute or two after turning the curling iron on, I am ready to curl my hair.  Also great for travel and priced reasonably.</li>
    <li> have used for years with my portable hair curler...love it...can always find what I&#x27;m looking for with amazon.  good job</li>
    <li> Thankful these are available online to purchase as I LOVE my portable curling iron.  Well worth the cost as these are hard to buy not online.</li>

I tried the curling irons and they worked perfectly and the cartridges were filled and new.I am  totally satisfied  with the purchase.My friendswill say, &amp;#34;where&#x27;d you get that&amp;#34;and I will recommend your company.

    <li> I purchased the Conair butane straighner with the refills.  I can not find these in Retail stores, so I purchase 8 Cartridges.  Seller shipped quickly and I leave one in my car at all times.  These seem to last a long time, but I only use it for touch ups and not as a main daily straighner, but I do use it every day.Great price and fast shipping.  Great for traveling too.</li>
    <li> Worked great.  Have ordered these often and never had any problem with them working.  They always fit in my curling iron.</li>

    <li> I use these in my butane curling iron, I can use it anywhere.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that they transport easily. And that they are refills. This is a great product for women on the go.</li>
    <li> Delivery was speedy and product works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have had this curling iron for years and had ran out of Conair ThermaCell refill cartridges a few years ago. Was so happy to find them at Amazon . Thank you.</li>
    <li> These are difficult to find in many retail stores and I was happy to find them on Amazon.  It is much more convening to us these in my curling iron than having a cord to mess with.  Also the price was better on Amozan and I like having them shipped right to me.</li>
    <li> Love my cordless curling iron, refills are awesome!,</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Great product.</li>
    <li> Exactly whatI was looking for and came quickly</li>
    <li> They work soooo good so I can sit anywhere I want and not be hooked to electricity.</li>
    <li> These liquid fueled cartridges work great with the Conair TC700X You Pro Cordless Thermacell Curling Iron listed on amazon, which actually works better than my regular curling iron! Keep in mind though, i have fine and naturally wavy hair. However, these refill cartridges are cheap and work great with the Conair You Pro Curling Iron i listed above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend buying both. Especially great for on-the-go and quick touch up situations. :)</li>
    <li> Promptly sent, good product!</li>
    <li> I had looked for these refills at my local stores but they did not keep them in stock (even though they still sold the curling iron) Ordering through Amazon was easy and less effort. Now I have enough to last for a couple of years.</li>
    <li> Like that they last three months. Size is good and weight is low. Not much more I can say today</li>
    <li> Replaced older different brand. Well pleased so far with my purchase. Very compact and easy to use. Thanks for great purchase!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different brands of curling irons over the years.  I have found that the Con Air Cordless curling iron works best for me.</li>
    <li> They work so well when you&#x27;re on the go easy to pack and do a great job without taking forever to get hot enough</li>
    <li> At age 67 I still love to go tent camping and restrooms are often a far distance away, sometimes without electricity and I&#x27;d rather look better when I have to \\&quot;meet the world\\&quot;.  I also motor cycle ride (we have a motorcycle tent trailer too) and of course I get that lovely \\&quot;helmet hair\\&quot; look.  Before this weekend trip I went to five (5) stores looking for the Conair ThermaCells for my curling iron, which must be at least 20 years old, and was without luck.  I knew I didn&#x27;t want to go on another trip this month without my old trusty Conair cordless curling iron.  YAY, here they are on Amazon.com and I am so excited, so I am ordering at least 4 refils.  THANK YOU AMAZON!!</li>
    <li> Works good now if the curler itself was in better shape I&#x27;d really be happy, but they do work it heats up great.</li>
    <li> I use these all the time and have a hard time finding them in the stores.  Great service from you.</li>
    <li> the spaces should be wider so you can fit them on the mattress better!</li>
    <li> good price, fast delivery</li>
    <li> Item as Described. Quick Shipping.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase. Delivery was prompt. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> where I go, these go with me and my curling iron. Love them.</li>
    <li> I had all but given up on finding refill cartridges for my Conair butane curling iron, but here they were on Amazon and at a great price too.</li>
    <li> Great product. Love it! I&#x27;ve used the Conair thermaCell curling iron for quick touch ups in the car or even while camping.</li>
    <li> Fits the curler and that is what I was looking for.  Received item at the same time I received the curling iron.</li>
    <li> Just like before.  Very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MJ</li>
    <li> this is really a must on my travel, the conair is soo handy and super holds my hair....</li>
    <li> Yard Gard Ultrasonic Animal Repeller............ don&#x27;t know if it really works for keeping away the rats or other animals but haven&#x27;t seen any droppings around where it is set up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conair Thermal CELL refill cartridges...........Amazon is the only place that I found that had them. &amp;#60;3</li>
