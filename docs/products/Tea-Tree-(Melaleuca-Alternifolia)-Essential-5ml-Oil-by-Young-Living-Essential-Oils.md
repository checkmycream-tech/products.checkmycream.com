    <li> Great smell, antibacterial, great for so many things with cleaning and boosting immune system.</li>

    <li> good price, arrived in good condion</li>
    <li> This IS a great product for ear infection, rash, toe fungus etc. BUT your picture shows a 15 ml bottle and we received a teeny tiny 5 ml bottle....considering the other lemongrass oil we received from you said 15ml in paperwork, the melaleuca says nothing and look at your ad...photo of 15ml when you could have photographed the mini bottle you were really going to be sending. Very deceptive and on purpose as you didn&#x27;t write the 5ml size in the words either.</li>
