      <li>I used to use this and loved it.</li>
      <li>Body Drench smells good out of the can, but then disappears so it does not compete with perfume.</li>
      <li>Good color, good application.</li>
      <li>Love the fine mist &amp; great color &amp; excellent price!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
      <li>I put 2 light coats on my legs as tester and was amazed at how good it looks!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>It is amazing.</li>
      <li>Nice color and scent</li>
      <li>Since this has a bronzer in it, would be nice if there was a &amp;#34;light to medium&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>This gives you a nice warm color.</li>
      <li>I spray on lightly, then rub in (I&#x27;ve found it best to wear plastic latex gloves to keep your palms clean).  </li>
      <li>This is the best self tanner I have found so far.  </li>
      <li>Let me tell you, this is by far the best tanning spray ( or lotion) that I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>It gave me the most awesome natural looking tan I could ask for.</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>My favorite thing about this product is how it goes on, non-greasy and dries immediately.</li>
      <li>Based on most of the reviews of this product I was looking forward to giving it a try, but the one or two people that said it would wash off after one day were correct.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t turn you orange and has a refreshing tropical smell.</li>
      <li>Not &amp;#34;worried about my shirt touching my face&amp;#34</li>
      <li>IT PROBABLY WOULD COST ME MORE TO SEND THE BODY</li>
      <li>it&#x27;ll look like you&#x27;ll have bruises:-)</li>
      <li>I love this spray tanner.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Tanner works awesome, sprays on easily and your tab develops instantly!</li>
      <li>Leaves a beautiful natural tan look.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve always been able to get the color out easily in the wash.</li>
      <li>It is a nice \\&quot;quick fix\\</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light mist and fries quickly and gives u amazing color ( between 2-4 shades darker).</li>
      <li>Loreal also doesn&#x27;t smell great, the color isn&#x27;t orange, but it doesn&#x27;t look super real either, and the mist wasn&#x27;t as fine as it needs to be, so once again, hair dryer to face and neck for too lengthy of a time period.  </li>
      <li>Great product, love how you can see the tan instantly</li>
      <li>but the product gets used up quickly if doing most of the body.</li>
      <li>I am very fair skinned, with a lot of pink undertones.  </li>
      <li>Huge plus for that alone.  </li>
      <li>So anything I use can&#x27;t have much of a smell, be greasy, or leave any kind of feeling of residue.     </li>
      <li>I would recommend you not to spray yourself before an important date.</li>
      <li>But after a couple of times, it goes on smooth and even.</li>
      <li>absolutely recomend it!!!</li>
      <li>I was really excited to get this product...</li>
      <li>Overall, definitely the best self tanner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>My feet just don&#x27;t tan as quickly as the rest of me.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know, but I had to quickly smear the globs around on my skin to keep it from looking &#x27;patchy&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>I just ran out of the my first bottle and am ordering again immediately !</li>
      <li>and I really liked it, it was called instant tanner.</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t get it right the first time and</li>
      <li>and (when it first became popular) took forever and a day to dry.  </li>
      <li>You can spray it on right before you go out as it dries quickly, has a very subtle smell (the best of any tanner I&#x27;ve ever used by far) and a powdery feel that includes a bronze finish.</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff!</li>
      <li>also, the color is really pretty.  </li>
      <li>I look like I just got back from a two week vacation:-)</li>
      <li>It instantly gives you a tan and it gets better after a day or so.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used tanning beds and many self-tanners over the years and am on a search for as close to \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; self-tanner as possible.</li>
      <li>Practice at home first.</li>
      <li>Was using other very pricey self tanning aerosol  sprays, however this is a comparable at a way better price!</li>
      <li>It does wash off quicker and you have to be careful to keep a rag handy to dab at any areas that may have too much.</li>
      <li>The mist is soooo super fine, that I can get out of the shower, spray, and blow dry my face for like 30 seconds</li>
      <li>By the way, it took the whole can for one application, so plan accordingly.</li>
      <li>I wanted the spray to really sink in.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t do the whole apply-after-shower-at-night routine.</li>
      <li>MY LEGS LOOKED LIKE I HAD SOME KIND OF DISEASE, AND IT TOOK SEVERAL WASHES AND ACTUAL SCRUBBING WITH A BRUSH TO GET OFF.</li>
      <li>The old stuff was a more yellow or ash tone.</li>
      <li>I used the old product to spray my feet when I wore sandles as funny as that sounds.</li>
      <li>This new product is very orange or even redish.  </li>
      <li>DRENCH QUICK TAN SPRAY BACK THAN WHAT THE PRODUCT COST.</li>
      <li>I order self tanners ALL the time, this one in particular, and NEVER have had an experience like this.</li>
      <li>Only downside, it pretty much lasts through 1 shower and then you&#x27;ll have to reapply.</li>
      <li>Okay, is it a bit messy to put it on?</li>
      <li>Like a new tan.</li>
      <li>Smells nice, ok coverage (not as thin &amp; more moisturizing than some sprays), but colour a little orange for us pale people.</li>
      <li>It does at first spray leave a bit of a red tone to your skin but that goes away.  </li>
      <li>And this works better than most of the expensive tanners I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
      <li>Standing naked in front of a large fan is not how I want to spend any 20-minute period of my life.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m obviously not a patient person, so the instantaneous color really works for me.  </li>
      <li>Actually found doing my legs outside in natural light helps with getting it somewhat even overall.</li>
      <li>Color is natural looking.  </li>
      <li>Dries fast and shows instantly.</li>
      <li>Color is super long lasting</li>

    <li> Tanner works awesome, sprays on easily and your tab develops instantly! Best if someone else sprays on you though just to ensure even tan</li>
    <li> Leaves a great color of tan with no effort. You just have to apray it eavenly onto skin, you do not scrub on to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recomend it!!!</li>
    <li> I have bought this product before and usually have no problems but this last time the can spray nozzel was messed up so I did not even get to use the can of spray.</li>
    <li> Drench used to sell a different product that came in a yellow can and I really liked it, it was called instant tanner. I thought they had just changed the packaging, wrong. The old stuff was a more yellow or ash tone. This new product is very orange or even redish.  I used the old product to spray my feet when I wore sandles as funny as that sounds. My feet just don&#x27;t tan as quickly as the rest of me. This new product stained any calloused areas orange that lingered way after the other areas had wore off after showering.( both knees and feet) My boy friend pointed at my feet and said what&#x27;s that orange stuff. Ha! I guess I need to keep looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read some great reviews about this product and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m not a newbie when it comes to tanning. I&#x27;ve tried different products out there. Let me tell you, this is by far the best tanning spray ( or lotion) that I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;m not orange at all. I look like I just got back from a two week vacation:-) I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars, because it takes practice to spray yourself evenly. I would recommend you not to spray yourself before an important date. Practice at home first. You won&#x27;t get it right the first time and it&#x27;ll look like you&#x27;ll have bruises:-) Oh yeah! Wear gloves, because your hands will turn orange. Or you can buy some stuff to take it off with. But after a couple of times, it goes on smooth and even.</li>
    <li> This gives you a nice warm color. Like a new tan. not orange at all. You can spray it on right before you go out as it dries quickly, has a very subtle smell (the best of any tanner I&#x27;ve ever used by far) and a powdery feel that includes a bronze finish. I have melasma on my face and use this with a small makeup brush on the light skin around the melasma spots and they almost vanish. And I only have to do that once a week. If you have melasma you know how hard it is to cover it with makeup. Try this melasma sufferers!-don&#x27;t forget your neck</li>
    <li> Body Drench Tan Spray is a very good product. I have been using self-tanners for years. I keep coming back to Body Drench. I don&#x27;t do the whole apply-after-shower-at-night routine. I apply after my morning shower. So anything I use can&#x27;t have much of a smell, be greasy, or leave any kind of feeling of residue.     I used Fake Bake for the last year and got tired of feeling like there was a layer of something on my skin, which there was. Fake Bake is fine if you use at night, but I did find much of the color came off in the shower. And there was a definite smell.    Body Drench smells good out of the can, but then disappears so it does not compete with perfume. My favorite thing about this product is how it goes on, non-greasy and dries immediately. There is no residue whatsoever. The color is great and wears off evenly.    Yeah, Body Drench!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this product...mother of 3, never have time to lay out in the sun...this was the perfect solution.  Carefully read the directions and tried to apply it, but it came out in clumps...???...maybe I got a defective bottle...I don&#x27;t know, but I had to quickly smear the globs around on my skin to keep it from looking &#x27;patchy&#x27;.  I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, ok coverage (not as thin &amp; more moisturizing than some sprays), but colour a little orange for us pale people. If you&#x27;re a little olive already or have a base, would probably be fine.  My faves are still Clarins &amp; St Tropez.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used tanning beds and many self-tanners over the years and am on a search for as close to \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; self-tanner as possible. Based on most of the reviews of this product I was looking forward to giving it a try, but the one or two people that said it would wash off after one day were correct. Total waste of $$ in my opinion, don&#x27;t bother with it.</li>
    <li> I like the product. Smells great you have to spray a lot and really wait a long time. However it does rub off easily even after waiting way past the amount of time recommended, I noticed that it rubbed off on my sheets and left a stain. If y want something for a one time use its perfect. If you want it to last a few days find a lotion.</li>
    <li> Although there was some trouble in the beginning, they went above and beyond to ship me the item as fast as they could. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Love this! Second time buying it</li>
    <li> Okay, is it a bit messy to put it on? Yes. Who cares! It gave me the most awesome natural looking tan I could ask for. I needed to be tan for my halloween costume party becuase I was showing a lot of skin. I got a ton of compliments! By the way, it took the whole can for one application, so plan accordingly. Two thumbs way up!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to see if it would be a cheaper alternative to the Joliese system.  It is a nice \\&quot;quick fix\\&quot;  It doesn&#x27;t last as long as the Joliese system but I use this to touch up any areas that I might have missed or if I haven&#x27;t had a chance to put the Joliese product on.  It does wash off quicker and you have to be careful to keep a rag handy to dab at any areas that may have too much.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!! I&#x27;ve used just about everything out there, I will say I have not used fake bake simply because the reviews say it leaves a greasy feel on your skin. I hate feeling like there&#x27;s something sitting on my skin and if I touch anything it will rub off. This product doesn&#x27;t feel like that at all! It&#x27;s a light mist and fries quickly and gives u amazing color ( between 2-4 shades darker). Doesn&#x27;t turn you orange and has a refreshing tropical smell. I spray it and let it dry and go to bed with my boyfriend and he doesn&#x27;t even notice. You can also spray two layers on (after you let the first layer dry) for darker results.</li>
    <li> I ordered 4 cans of this product over about 4 months.  One can was clogged from day one and useless.  The others worked but you have to clear the spray constantly.  If the spray works, the product is great.    It&#x27;s probably a combination of the texture of the tanning material - size of the spray opening and not enough pressure in the can.  Hard to recommend, based on the spray issues.</li>
    <li> I used to use this and loved it. looked dark and natural. Now i put it on and in one day it looks dirty. Am disappointed although the price was great($7.00 instead of $17.00 at Sallys)but will look for someting else</li>
    <li> I use this product in my face because I tan my body but not my face. It is amazing. love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost everything when it comes to spray tanning and this is my go to self tanner. Perfect color and looks great underneath makeup. Goes on evenly and you can control how dark you want to go. Dries fast and shows instantly. And this works better than most of the expensive tanners I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
    <li> Definitely can see where it goes on. Nice color and scent but the product gets used up quickly if doing most of the body. Legs are hard to spray evenly and if not done correctly you will see dark and light areas. Actually found doing my legs outside in natural light helps with getting it somewhat even overall. Since this has a bronzer in it, would be nice if there was a &amp;#34;light to medium&amp;#34; applicator. Should be applied standing in the shower as the spray tends to wind up on the baseboard and other areas if not. Overall, definitely the best self tanner I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not new to the tanning rodeo at all.  I&#x27;ve been actually tanning for WAY too many years, and then a few years back, decided to lay off my face, as I noticed some lines I didn&#x27;t approve of.  So, I started experimenting with spray tans.  For a while, I got professionally sprayed, which is annoying and (when it first became popular) took forever and a day to dry.  Standing naked in front of a large fan is not how I want to spend any 20-minute period of my life.  Plus, spray tan STINKS.  You smell like a locker room until you can take your first shower -- which I always did no earlier than 24 hours later, b/c I wanted the spray to really sink in.  Anyway, for touch-ups, Id use Loreal Sublime, which is a typical, sub-standard over the counter product, but I didn&#x27;t realize that there were other options until this past year.  Loreal also doesn&#x27;t smell great, the color isn&#x27;t orange, but it doesn&#x27;t look super real either, and the mist wasn&#x27;t as fine as it needs to be, so once again, hair dryer to face and neck for too lengthy of a time period.  So, I found this guy and read reviews, ordered some and LOVESSS ITTTTT.  The mist is soooo super fine, that I can get out of the shower, spray, and blow dry my face for like 30 seconds and it&#x27;s completely dry. Not kind of dry.  Not &amp;#34;worried about my shirt touching my face&amp;#34; dry.  Totally dry.  Huge plus for that alone.  also, the color is really pretty.  And instant.  there is no gradual buildup over time.  I&#x27;m obviously not a patient person, so the instantaneous color really works for me.  All in all, a great buy.  I just ran out of the my first bottle and am ordering again immediately !</li>
    <li> THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT A GRADUAL TANNING PRODUCT....... WHICH I THOUGHT IT WAS. SPRAYED THIS ON MY LEGS AND THE COLOR CAME OUT OF THE CAN..... VERY VERY DARK. MY LEGS LOOKED LIKE I HAD SOME KIND OF DISEASE, AND IT TOOK SEVERAL WASHES AND ACTUAL SCRUBBING WITH A BRUSH TO GET OFF. HATED THIS PRODUCT WISH I WOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE I MADE MY PURCHASE. IT PROBABLY WOULD COST ME MORE TO SEND THE BODY DRENCH QUICK TAN SPRAY BACK THAN WHAT THE PRODUCT COST.</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner I have found so far.  I am very fair skinned, with a lot of pink undertones.  This sprays out and dries within minutes.  I spray on lightly, then rub in (I&#x27;ve found it best to wear plastic latex gloves to keep your palms clean).  You&#x27;ll get some instant color (which prevents streaking/missed spots) and then a little more color later.  Color is natural looking.  Only downside, it pretty much lasts through 1 shower and then you&#x27;ll have to reapply.</li>
    <li> I❤️ this product, it is wonderful and the color....perfect!!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff! Good color, good application. Color is super long lasting but it&#x27;s a great spray for both me and my boyfriend.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for some time and I always recieve compliments on my \\&quot;tan\\&quot;. Nobody knows its self tanner! It also doesnt have a bad scent either. Definitely a good product!</li>
    <li> Great product, love how you can see the tan instantly and it doesn&#x27;t turn orange. Great for an on the go sun kissed look.</li>
    <li> First....this picture is not what you get. You get the old cans,which alarm me because if that&#x27;s what they are selling,that&#x27;s what should be pictured &amp; also who actually knows how old the old cans actually are!!! Second...they make it seem like a great deal getting the spray can for $7.00, but in all actuality they charge you an obsene amount for shipping so just watch out for that. I ordered 1Can and my shipping $36.00!!!! So I cancelled my order asap because that just seemed like a scam to me. I order self tanners ALL the time, this one in particular, and NEVER have had an experience like this. I cancelled this one &amp; ordered the same product (3 cans) for the same price the company was going to charge for 1 w/shipping!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this product because my skin hates the sun. This is the only product I have found that gives me a natural looking glow and doesn&#x27;t leave me streaky or orange. I love it! I now buy 3 at a time!</li>
    <li> Love the fine mist &amp; great color &amp; excellent price!&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed.. Was using other very pricey self tanning aerosol  sprays, however this is a comparable at a way better price!</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s got bronzer in it so you get immediate color and gets darker. It doesn&#x27;t have that gross self tanning smell either. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  Does not turn skin orange.  Leaves a beautiful natural tan look.  I am very pleased with this product and will continue to order it !!!</li>
    <li> I love this spray tanner.  It instantly gives you a tan and it gets better after a day or so.  It does at first spray leave a bit of a red tone to your skin but that goes away.  I&#x27;ve had it stain towels but I&#x27;ve always been able to get the color out easily in the wash.</li>
    <li> No orange streaks.. Goes on even</li>
    <li> Goes on evenly and smells amazing! No orange tint. I put 2 light coats on my legs as tester and was amazed at how good it looks!</li>
    <li> Nozzle was missing it is useless.</li>
