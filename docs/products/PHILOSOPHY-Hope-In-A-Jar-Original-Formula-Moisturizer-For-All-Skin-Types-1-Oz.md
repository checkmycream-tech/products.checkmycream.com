      <li>The first ingredient in the list should be HOPE!</li>
      <li>Good as expected.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this product, but I really didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
      <li>Not bad but from what I have heard I expected something more!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m willing to spend money on a moisturizer that smells nice, even if it doesn&#x27;t deliver younger looking skin.  </li>
      <li>I am not a beauty professional, just a lady who wants to look great and look younger than I truly am!</li>
      <li>love it..very light on your skin...but does the job of moisturizing...delivered before expected date...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light, but enough to bother me until I fall asleep at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love all of them I use them all regularly and now have 2 or 3 of my girlfriends using them to</li>
      <li>I use this daily and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>First ever face cream to make my eyes tearful upon application.  </li>
      <li>I used this for 4+ months &amp; could&#x27;ve got same or better results w/ drugstore brands.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have major skins issues &amp; just light moisturizer...</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m getting old at 47 and the skin on my face was dry and flaking in some areas and oily in others.&lt;br /&gt;After using Hope in a Jar, my skin just feel better,it looks more fresh.  </li>
      <li>I really hoped it could work for me</li>
      <li>It goes on light, but you feel the moisture instantly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not sticky or greasy, but I do feel like it just sits on the surface of my skin without absorbing well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The philosphy web site is very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have  very sensitive skin with roseacea.</li>
      <li>But I haven&#x27;t used any face cream (except for sunscreens) that could make me my eyes red because of its smell and/or its ingredients, and this is the first one.  </li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t seem to go with my eyes, which are not so sensitive as I know.</li>
      <li>recommend this skin cream to anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>The entire line is high quality in a low end package.</li>
      <li>Left my skin really soft.</li>
      <li>I consider my skin combo w/ large pores and uneven texture.</li>

    <li> Love this product.. and at a much better price than anywhere else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin so smooth! A small jar will last you for a very, very long time too!</li>
    <li> Good as expected. Not sticky on my face.</li>
    <li> Hope in a Jar is just OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not sticky or greasy, but I do feel like it just sits on the surface of my skin without absorbing well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a funky, chemical smell.  It&#x27;s very light, but enough to bother me until I fall asleep at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this moisturizer has a devoted following, but it&#x27;s just not right for me.  The most important thing to me in any beauty product is the fragrance (or lack of) because, let&#x27;s face it, there&#x27;s no miracle in these creams.  I&#x27;m willing to spend money on a moisturizer that smells nice, even if it doesn&#x27;t deliver younger looking skin.  Hope in a Jar isn&#x27;t that moisturizer.</li>
    <li> my favorite moisturizer</li>
    <li> Nice size jar for travel</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell</li>
    <li> What an amazing moisturizer! I use this daily and absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve been using it for years because I am so happy with it, I have no desire or need to change! The first ingredient in the list should be HOPE! I am not a beauty professional, just a lady who wants to look great and look younger than I truly am! Well this product sure does help. It goes on light, but you feel the moisture instantly. It is not heavy, greasy and thick. It absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily all day. My skin loves it and drinks it in! I&#x27;m 47 and like I said I&#x27;ve been using it for years, my 22 year old beautiful daughter uses it as well and loves it. That is how amazing this product is! Give it a try, you&#x27;ll love it as much as I do. As you can see in the photo, I am very happy with philosophy products (this is just a small sample of my collection).</li>

    <li> I sent this to my daughter Hope for her birthday, and she likes it very much !</li>
    <li> I have been using Philosophy Hope in a Jar for years, but never got any that was as &amp;#34;soupy&amp;#34; as this. It smells the same and looks the same, but it is like putting water on my face.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product, but I really didn&#x27;t like it at all. It had a horrible smell to it and it seemed to just hang out on the surface of my skin instead of penetrating into it.</li>
    <li> love it..very light on your skin...but does the job of moisturizing...delivered before expected date...great customer service...will be back</li>
    <li> Not bad but from what I have heard I expected something more! The smell is not good and I don&#x27;t see any improvement with fine lines!!!</li>
    <li> Quick ship no problems !!</li>
    <li> Best face cream I have ever used. My skin feels like silk.</li>
    <li> Hope In A Jar has been around for quite a while, there&#x27;s a reason for that, it&#x27;s a GREAT product, a great moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily or greasy.</li>
    <li> Worked well. Moisturized my face but I don&#x27;t care for the smell. It&#x27;s kind of chemical like. Luckily it dissipates quickly.</li>
    <li> love it have used philosophy products for 3 years I love all of them I use them all regularly and now have 2 or 3 of my girlfriends using them to</li>
    <li> Left my skin really soft. A little goes a long way. Didn&#x27;t leave it oily and it smells great.</li>
    <li> Oh my god. First ever face cream to make my eyes tearful upon application.  The texture spreads well on my face and seems to be moisturizing.  But I haven&#x27;t used any face cream (except for sunscreens) that could make me my eyes red because of its smell and/or its ingredients, and this is the first one.  I really hoped it could work for me but it doesn&#x27;t seem to go with my eyes, which are not so sensitive as I know.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand before &amp; liked it. I consider my skin combo w/ large pores and uneven texture. This particular product never seemed to be enough moisture, even my less dry areas. I never noticed even a subtle difference in my skins texture. I am currently trying other products. If you don&#x27;t have major skins issues &amp; just light moisturizer... Maybe this will suffice. I used this for 4+ months &amp; could&#x27;ve got same or better results w/ drugstore brands.</li>
    <li> It was all that I expected it would be, the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like was the hint of fragrance that accompanied the moisturizer. Over all well product, also arrived on time!</li>
    <li> By far the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. Light and leaves the skin so smooth!</li>
    <li> I have  very sensitive skin with roseacea. My skin gets red immediately if I use the wrong product. This formula is  perfect. It&#x27;s not oily at all and it smells fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend purchasing it at Amazon too. The philosphy web site is very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this skin cream to anyone with sensitive skin.  Enjoy !</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m getting old at 47 and the skin on my face was dry and flaking in some areas and oily in others.&lt;br /&gt;After using Hope in a Jar, my skin just feel better,it looks more fresh.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> My skin never breaks out but I used this once and my forehead broke out terribly. More like a nightmare in a jar for me.</li>
    <li> Love this! Best lotion and can&#x27;t beat that price!</li>
