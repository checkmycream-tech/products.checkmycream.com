### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great.  </li>
      <li>Very effective deodorant even for men.</li>
      <li>Good quality ... fair price ...</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Will buy more to stock up.</li>
      <li>It works better</li>
      <li>I love this deodorant.</li>
      <li>The new Dove Dry Spray is incredible, smells great, goes on better, and my skin likes it much much MUCH more.</li>
      <li>and then it no longer was available, so I switched to the aerosol type.</li>
      <li>For many years I&#x27;ve  been using stick deodorant, and this was my first time buying a spray deodorant.</li>
      <li>Works great, I sweat a lot, keeps me dry....</li>
      <li>I had to change to the spray for medical issues and it leaves me feeling secure and smelling good.</li>
      <li>No stain and is great for active ladies.</li>
      <li>but that is the only kind I like to use.  </li>
      <li>I liked the basic product.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Degree for years, first the roll-on</li>
      <li>It smells so good, keeps your underarms dry and it last.</li>
      <li>So I can use it directly in my underarm without feeling irritation, in spite of my skin being super sensitive.</li>
      <li>It smells okay, but goes on very wet, doesn&#x27;t dry easily, and really bothered my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend that product.</li>
      <li>Lovely smell and long lasting deodorant.  </li>
      <li>The area that I live in didn&#x27;t sell it anywhere.</li>
      <li>Very sweet and long lasting smell</li>
      <li>This keeps me fresh all day long.</li>
      <li>I guess if you put deodorant on outside so you can get some fresh air while taking care of your personal hygiene then this might work for you.</li>
      <li>Unfortunatley not on the market any more, it&#x27;s very hard to find.</li>
      <li>I bought several cans &amp; will definitely make another purchase soon to keep a small stock available.</li>

    <li> Works great, I sweat a lot, keeps me dry....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Degree for years, first the roll-on and then it no longer was available, so I switched to the aerosol type. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do so I hope they never stop making this product.</li>
    <li> Very sweet and long lasting smell and it&#x27;s delicate on skin. So I can use it directly in my underarm without feeling irritation, in spite of my skin being super sensitive.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that works for me. I sweat profusely and for a time was using Axe Phoenix for men. It worked, but left me smelling a bit funky (like a man) after sweating. This keeps me fresh all day long.</li>
    <li> I have never used spray deodorant before and was nervous, thinking it wouldn&#x27;t work as well.  After a few days of using this product im hooked.  I had to change to the spray for medical issues and it leaves me feeling secure and smelling good.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant. For many years I&#x27;ve  been using stick deodorant, and this was my first time buying a spray deodorant. It smells so good, keeps your underarms dry and it last. Not to mention it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, even after shaving.</li>
    <li> No stain and is great for active ladies.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this everywhere and finally found it online.  The area that I live in didn&#x27;t sell it anywhere. It works well and there is not all that white buildup.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Very effective deodorant even for men.</li>
    <li> Great.  Good quality ... fair price ...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why stores quit carrying the aerosol spray of Degree but that is the only kind I like to use.  I bought several cans &amp; will definitely make another purchase soon to keep a small stock available.</li>
    <li> if it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working, try holding it upside down. I think they may have designed it so you apply it with the same hand. It works better i</li>
    <li> I liked the basic product. However, the covers are attached very tight and take a lot of strength to open. One cover was on so thight that when I finally pulled it off I broke the spray head.</li>
    <li> Terrible. I made the mistake of purchasing a 3 pack and I am not able to use it as it makes me gasp for air and choke. I guess if you put deodorant on outside so you can get some fresh air while taking care of your personal hygiene then this might work for you. Smell was overwhelming and fumes are very nasty. I contacted Amazon and they can not return even an unopened package of this due to the aerosol. Can not be shipped back.</li>
    <li> Lovely smell and long lasting deodorant.  Lingering dampness is why I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars. Blow drying underarms after spraying helps.</li>
    <li> Love it! Unfortunatley not on the market any more, it&#x27;s very hard to find. Will buy more to stock up.</li>
    <li> I was using this for a while. It smells okay, but goes on very wet, doesn&#x27;t dry easily, and really bothered my sensitive skin. The new Dove Dry Spray is incredible, smells great, goes on better, and my skin likes it much much MUCH more. I highly recommend that product.</li>
    <li> It met expectations described on the product.</li>
    <li> I had trouble finding this in person.</li>
