<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really well made, nice heavy duty product. It arrived yesterdayI tried it out last night, not sure why ppl would give it a negative review. Its pretty straightforward on how to use properly. Insert 1/8 inches into area you need to trim and turn the lower half back and fourth. I want to mention there was an issue w my order but The company upgraded my order and even sent me an additional one for free. This is a handy lil item to have, plus its small shape and design are nice too. Its just a little longer in size than a AA battery and about the same weight as well.</li>
    <li> I had one for 20 plus years and dropped it on the hard floor and this is a replacement for that unit.  Their is no comparison between the two units.  This one is a terrific upgrade at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Most excellent. I had been using scissors for decades, and had suffered from some nasty hair pulls. These do a great job without the pain.</li>
    <li> So far so good....Ask me again in a couple of months....</li>
    <li> better than I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> No batteries - what a concept.</li>
    <li> Works great. Definitely is important to read the 1-2 sentence instructions: rotate the wheel back and forth, not continuously in one direction.  If you run the wheel in one direction for several turns, it probably will pull on your hairs from time to time which is unpleasant.  If  you use it as suggested, it works better than the electric model I had that died.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this product because I was tired of trimming the old fashioned way. I have used this years ago from a friend and had a horrific experience, but now that I own it, it&#x27;s the best product for this need. The reason for such a horrible experience was because I used it incorrectly. You have to twist the item to cut the hair, but the key is not to twist in one direction the entire time. If you read the directions it specifically states to twist back and forth, and now the product works without any pain. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> All it does is tangle up in the hair and then you have to yank it out. I wouldn&#x27;t spend $5 on this product.</li>
    <li> I read a couple reviews that said that the this thing would pull nose hairs from time to time. That has not been the case for me. It works great. I like that you don&#x27;t need to charge it or use batteries. A trimmer should not be as complicated as all that.</li>
    <li> Hard to use, doesn&#x27;t trim very well, left me with painful ingrown hairs.  Look into a Wahl rechargeable nose hair trimmer, that&#x27;s what I am using now and I am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This item uses old time values.  No batteries or plug ins, just functional manual trimming.  If you want a trimmer that works, this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done - but pulls like crazy.  I like its precision - gets to hard to reach spots that my electric one won&#x27;t - but hesitate to use it because it hurts!</li>
    <li> I had one before but lost it.  Very well made, will last a lifetime.  Far better than electronic versions which break all the time.</li>
    <li> popped it out of the plastic and right into my nose.  span it a few times and my nose hair was gone.  i could not even feel it cutting the hair. super sharp felt no tugging of hair.  quick rinse in the sink and good to go. highly reccomend this product. Merica!</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few years ago and found it superior to the electronic models. I decided to buy a second for travel, which I do often. Alas, the new product mainly plucks the hair, rather than cutting it. Very unpleasant, so off it went to rubbish bin. If you advertise a high quality product, you better deliver it. You have no credibility.</li>
    <li> I ordered it for my husband and he loves it. He got tired of buying batteries for the ones he had prior to this one</li>
    <li> I originally wrote a 1-star review here because the one I bought off amazon did nothing but pull hairs.  I put it away and forgot about it.  After some time went by, I decided to contact the company and see if they would send me a replacement in case this one was just a bad apple.  Because there were many satisfied customers leaving good reviews here, but my old one didn&#x27;t cut hairs at all, just cinched and yanked them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got an email response the same day.  And two days later I have a replacement.  And it works GREAT!  Didn&#x27;t even have to return the old one.  I&#x27;m really really satisfied with the product, but even further, I am wholly satisfied with the company and their customer support.  This is way awesome.  Thanks Groom Mate!</li>
    <li> Put it up by the nose-nostrils, give it a fast spin with your fingers and watch it do the job.  Works great, cheap, and takes up very little room in the bathroom cabinet. This little guy is all I will ever need to take care of this grooming issue, as long as I don&#x27;t loose it (it is rather small) I will never need to worry about embarrassing nose hairs.  It&#x27;s not electric and I do not see how it could ever break if you only use it for the purpose intended.  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned that this may not be a good product at first since the manufacturer has obviously padded the reviews of it on this website. But it actually is really good. In my experiance the electric ones last at most a year or two. Although I&#x27;ve only had this manual version for a couple months based on the high quality of manufacturing it seems like it will last decades. But this high quality craftmanship leads to one drawback, since the metal is so thick and heavy duty it doesn&#x27;t cut hair quite as short as the cheap thin metal electric trimmers so those hairs growing at the very end of your nostrils will stick out just a little bit no matter how long you try to cut them with this. But I&#x27;d rather deal with that then buying a new one every year.</li>
    <li> i Did not receive this producer i have no the cause of all this delay, more than ten days still did not received it and I have had no response to my inquiry from the seller, so this is shameful and bad service and I can not judge the product because I did not get it yet ....to me i will not give him any star ..&lt;br /&gt;also i will not deal with seller any more ...</li>
    <li> This trimmer works very well:  cuts hair without pulling, no batteries or cords to hassle with and easy to clean.  Comes in a little case.</li>
    <li> Nice man tool...  Does the job, well made, easy to use, solid.  I would highly recommend over an electical nose hair trimmer...</li>
    <li> I originally saw a similar product in a small grooming store in Australia for over $100, which gave me an idea to search for a similar product for a fraction of the price, when I found this little guy.  I believe it has all the quality that the expensive one has, but at a fraction of the price.  There is very little a person could do to dull this.  I use it quite frequently and after about five years now, it is still performing just as good as day one.  Just needs a little cleaning now and again.</li>
    <li> Without any doubt excellent. Very occasionally may pull a hair but that is definitely acceptable since no need of batteries and lifelong warranty.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much out of this thang when I bought it, but I was very pleasantly surprised with how well this item works. AND, it doesn&#x27;t pull on the hairs or tickle the inside cavities like the different battery operated units that I&#x27;ve owned in the past. It just does it&#x27;s job very quickly and efficiently.</li>
    <li> You can forget about all those other battery-operated nose-hair trimmers. This one leaves them in the dirt. Simple, elegant, well made, cleaner, greener and it works. All day, every day. The only logical choice.</li>
    <li> If we&#x27;re just talking about travel use, this would be a five on the convenience chart simply because you don&#x27;t need to pack a charger or replace a battery.  But, for $20 you expect something great. The Groom Mate Platinum XL is not without it&#x27;s short falls unfortunately.  Let me first say I&#x27;ve been using this thing for about a year now and have tried every way known to optimize use.  The main problem with it, which I feel deducts 2 stars alone is that it is messy.  Though a few cut hairs will get caught in the middle, almost all of the hair clippings get scattered in your nose.  This means you will either inhale them and swallow them down your throw, or they will stay in your nose and fall out at random times as you are breathing in and out.  Trust me, this is NOT something that you want to happen before a date.  If you use this before a big occasion, and want to prevent this, you will find yourself picking your nose to pull out the hairs.  They will, of course, get stuck inside your finger nails.  The other two stars deducted are because there is a large amount of pain from pulling if you even slightly move the trimmer while you are twisting the bottom.  Yes it has a life time warranty, but that does not mean the blade always remains sharp unfortunately.  I&#x27;m going to keep this in my travel bag, but I would not consider this a 4-5 star product like most are giving it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a series of inexpensive battery operated trimmers, but they have not worked well.  They&#x27;re usually cheaply made, don&#x27;t trim well, require batteries (kind of wasteful for such a simple task), and most annoyingly, tickle the inside of my nose to the point where I can&#x27;t stand them.  I stumbled on this while searching on Amazon for another battery-operated trimmer.  Based on reviews, the one I was looking for apparently is not well liked...But a link was on the Amazon page to this one.    So this one sounded interesting, and it&#x27;s made in the USA, not China.    Pros: Small, durable, easy to carry for traveling.  Works well; it trimmed much more than my larger battery-operated ones.  It needs no batteries, and is made in the USA.  It doesn&#x27;t pull hairs or tickle my nose (Finally!), and it makes no noise.      Cons: It&#x27;s smaller than you think after seeing the picture above.  That&#x27;s good for traveling, but it makes it slightly awkward to use.  If it were a bit larger you would be able to get a better grip on it.  So an elderly person with arthritis in their hands would probably have a hard time using it.  Also, I wish it trimmed slightly closer than it does.  My nose tickles easily and makes me sneeze a lot, so I was hoping to almost eliminate the hairs, but instead it leaves a mm or two.  This is more of a personal annoyance, so it likely will not bother most people.    Considering basic shipping is included, the price is reasonable, but more than most other trimmers.  If it lasts a long time it will have been worth it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my brother which may seem strange but we&#x27;re talking about a guy that pretty much has everything he needs and wants. He was recently complaining about the lack of a decent nose hair trimmer and figured that he would have to spend at least $100 in order to get one that worked. I did a little research and decided to surprise him with the Groom Mate Platinum XL. He put the product to use right away, claiming it to be painless and easy to use. He added that it is \\&quot;the best gift I&#x27;ve received in a long time.\\&quot; Now I know what I will be getting for my two other brothers. Maybe not the most exciting- but definitely useful, practical and a real surprise! You can&#x27;t beat the price- free shipping! and stellar customer service. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After trying various battery-powered trimmers that were ineffective and/or broke after a short time, I found this trimmer.  It is solidly built and works great.  This will be the last trimmer I buy.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is unique because it does not operate on batteries. Instead, you twist the bottom back and forth to make it work. It effectively cuts the hair, but it takes much longer to achieve results than a battery-operated one would. It also rips the hair sometimes which is painful. It&#x27;s not very precise, and you have to position it multiple times before it actually cuts in some places. It works overall, it&#x27;s just not very efficient.</li>
    <li> Like the title says ...  it works ! So much better than the battery operated ones I have (I have 3 battery nose hair trimmers that just don&#x27;t \\&quot;cut\\&quot; it - pun intended). The Groom Mate Plat. XL is great and cuts nose hair deep inside and on the edge (interior) of my nose. I don&#x27;t have hair on the outside of my nose - LOL.  It does tickle at first - you just have to get use to it. After the initial \\&quot;tickle\\&quot; it works great. Have had it now for 2 months and will never go back to a battery operated device. The size is perfect too. Travels like a dream.</li>
    <li> Nine-five percent of the time the device works great ... then comes the pain ..., searing, ripping, bloody pain! If you&#x27;re a masochist and enjoy surprises, you&#x27;ll love the fearful anticipation that comes with the useful of this medieval device.</li>
    <li> I bought this bc of all the positive reviews like it appears many others as a secondary travel nose trimmer as my electric one is bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This does not even cut your nose hairs. It can not find them. To guide them into the barrel is like shooting in the dark. I used this for 20 minutes back forth back forth and was not even sure if there was any difference. I didn&#x27;t see any trimmings on the device, nor did a hear or feel the device cutting... so i was confused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to take out my old battery panasonic device and turned it on and it cut everything like normally does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how this thing got so many good reviews?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO FRIKKING IDEA?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WASTE OF $20!</li>
    <li> I tried out the groom mate for a few months but have gone back to my electric clippers and here&#x27;s why.&lt;br /&gt;With electric nose clippers I always hear it working, giving a slight change of pitch when removing the hairs, one by one. It&#x27;s very easy to hear when the hair is being removed.&lt;br /&gt;This is not true with the Groom Mate. I can never really tell if the hairs are actually being cut. There&#x27;s no positive feedback with the Groom Mate.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, I found that using the Groom Mate on my ears is very awkward with two hands. Again, the electric clippers do a better job.</li>
    <li> Works great. Sometimes a little pinch when using, but overall fine. Should last a life time.</li>
    <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t give this enough time, but initial reaction was disappointment.  I agree with another reviewer that I wanted to like it -- it looked good on paper and it appears to be very well made and of high quality metals.  But I was not able to make it work up to my needs.  I have had better success with a hand held rechargeable groomer which has multiple attachments for nose, ear, and other areas.</li>
    <li> What a piece of crap. Doesn&#x27;t work unless you use both hands to hold it. Pulls hairs most of the time. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. Buy one with a battery operated motor in it.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with this product.  I have used a motorized nose &amp; ear hair trimmer before and tried using scissors.  I find this device to be superior to both.    I previously used some mainstream brand of electric ear/nose hair trimmer.  I found that it annoyed me in many ways.  First the thing heats up, which also makes the peculiar smell these things typically have(i guess from the lubricating oil) worse.  Also it made a decent bit of noise.  I was afraid that it was going to eat my face when I was using it.    Using scissors was just a bad idea for me.. a few cuts later and I&#x27;m on Amazon looking for a replacement.    The manual control of the device feels much more natural for me (better than sticking something electric making a loud WHIRRRRING noise inside my nose).  The Groom Mate makes little to no noise.  Very simple to clean.  Feels very well constructed.  The device is VERY compact so it is another huge benefit over the electric.  Also, another implication of the fact that it is manually operated: NO BATTERIES!  In terms of speed comparison I actually think that this product is faster than using the electric.  I frequently found that I had to go over the same place over and over or spend a lot of time in one place in order for the electric trimmer to work well.  However the Groom Mate seems to work more reliably which helps to get things done faster.    I would highly recommend this product to anyone searching for a simple yet effective ear/nose hair trimmer.  Especially those who don&#x27;t relish the idea of putting a noisy, smelly, hot motorized blade inside their head.    When I bought my Groom Mate it was being offered by BEI - PHR Systems, Ltd.  I just want to say that the shipping from them was very fast.  I was quite satisfied with my transaction.</li>
    <li> I have tried many power trimmers in the past. Several from Sharper Image, cheap ones, expensive ones, all kinds... As a man, I gravitate towards things that are &#x27;powered&#x27; and make noise because that&#x27;s what men correlate with efficacy... Not here, Jack. All of the power ones I&#x27;ve used suck. I&#x27;m always scrambling to find batteries, they die quickly, the blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough, they pinch and grab...The list goes on and on... But this magical little device is simply amazing. Upon arrival, I tore open the packaging and used it right away. It&#x27;s small, really small. About as long and wide as my index finger. It&#x27;s heavy, and I can tell it is well made. I inserted the tip into my nostril, and like the instructions said, I twisted the bottom half back and forth; I couldn&#x27;t even tell anything was happening, and after a little while, I removed it from my nose, and was amazed: totally and completely trimmed. No noise, no pinching, no batteries- rinsed the tip and I was done. What a wonderful device. The shipping from the seller was also very fast and I paid ~$19 for the device. Well worth the price considering a lot of the \\&quot;nice\\&quot; powered ones are $20+.  Highly recommend this product and company.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why anyone would buy another junky plastic battery powered trimmer that breaks easily when you can have the Groom Mate!  This thing is built solid and seems like it should last forever.  It&#x27;s super portable, no silly charger or batteries needed.  It&#x27;s simple to use, effective, less painful than electric ones, and super easy to clean and maintain!  Buy one now, never have to buy another again- it&#x27;s that good.  Better on the environment from energy use and also no waste from tossing trimmers when they break (as all others I&#x27;ve tried do).  For some things, electronic is definitely not better.    Also, the company that makes these has AMAZING customer service.  My first shipment was delayed because the mailman couldn&#x27;t find my slot, but the Groom Mate people immediately emailed me making sure they had the correct address, and then upgraded to priority mail at no cost to me to make sure I got it the second time.  That&#x27;s just awesome.</li>
    <li> My wife gave me this a couple of years ago. I love it.  You do have to take your time and do it right, twist quickly.  It cuts like there are several small scissors that work when you rotate the handle.  Gotta brush it out regularly, because it really does work and the blades will get loaded with snot, wax and hair.  Like with anything worth doing you must take your time and do it right.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent, high quality product.  Unlike the cheap battery powered ones, the cutting head doesn&#x27;t catch and pull hairs as it turns.  This is, to date, the only such product I&#x27;ve owned that actually does its job in a usable manner.    And the plastic clamshell package wasn&#x27;t heat-sealed, so I didn&#x27;t have to kill myself opening it!    Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> DOESN&#x27;T CUT NOSE HAIR VERY GOOD</li>
    <li> Not impressed. Go for a battery powered unit. You turn the bottom of the trimmer to make the cutting blade move.  Amazon did a great job of getting the product out quickly.</li>
    <li> This thing really works!  I was skeptical at first viewing, but Googled it and found a lot of favorable reviews.  They were right.  No more batteries, no little electric (battery) trimmers that really don&#x27;t cut very well.  This works, doesn&#x27;t nick or cut you, just the hair.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this trimmer long, however, so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to do the job just fine!&lt;br /&gt;Best of all - no batteries and it appears to be well made.</li>
    <li> Both my nose and I are happy with this product. It is quality guage metal and uses no plastics or batteries. As long as I have fingers and nostrils I will be extatic with this product!</li>
    <li> Iam very satistied with the Groom Mate nose hair trimmer.  I tried a few   bettery operated nose hair trimmers but it either did not last long  or the trimmers did not have the good blade design like Groom Mate trimmer  to cut the hair efficiently.</li>
    <li> It is a quality made product, but read the description very carefully.  I didn&#x27;t.  I just saw American Made and went for it.  It is high quality but it is MANUAL.  Who buys a manual nose trimmer.  You have to have three arms.  Would i but another?  NO.</li>
    <li> This thing is made heavy duty but it still pulls the hair out. You MUST constantly push the 2 parts into each other to keep the blades cutting or it WILL rip the hairs out. Not reccomeded !</li>
    <li> Great quality and my husband loves it!</li>
    <li> Advertise picture is much larger than actual size. I am not expecting this product is non-battery operate, it is manual.</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and buy this now!  Every nose hair trimmer has made me cry.  This trimmer is Nirvana!  Very high quilty and built in America!!</li>
    <li> Read a few negative reviews and was a little worried, especially about the size since I&#x27;m 6&#x27;4\\&quot; and have big hands.  I received the product quickly, and for a reasonable amount for something not included in Prime, and was quickly reassured.  It is a quality product that is the perfect size and works great.  It worked better and quicker than any electric trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had.  It cut so well there was no pulling or discomfort.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> It worked out of the box but quickly dulled and pulls out hair. I tried multiple times to contact the manufacturer by phone and email for the warranty but no response. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I thought the people witting these reviews were exaggerating, but they are right. I have used 3 different battery operated trimmers before and none come even close to this little product. It also feels like it is going to last a long time because of it&#x27;s strong steel construction. Only time will tell.</li>
    <li> Compact and sturdy, with a nice heft to it. No batteries to wear out and end up in the landfill. Requires two-handed operation (one to hold the body, one to twist the base), but I am still easily able to reach anywhere I want to trim.  On the downside, I slightly miss the ease of just passing an electric trimmer back and forth over the area I want to shave. This is more like a rotating scissors than a powered shaver. Still like it, though, and wouldn&#x27;t go back.</li>
    <li> I ordered this through Amazon and it arrived in Calif. 2 days later (from N.C.), with no shipping or tax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little skeptical since it is hand operated and thought it must be awkward using it in the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impression was, where is the trimming noise (used to that on the battery operated ones).  But in just a few short minutes everything I wanted trimmed was gone.  Painlessly and effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product feels like it is built like Fort Knox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should last forever.</li>
    <li> Product is metallic and seems well-made; I would anticipate it will continue working for a long time.  Have tried a number of battery operated trimmers over the years ... all of which quickly failed or were underpowered.  You must have reasonable flexability and movement to use this device ... it required using two hands - one to position the trimmer, the other to manually turn the cutting blades.  If your range of movement is restricted, this product may not work well.    However, product does as good a job as any other trimmer I have used.  Thus, I rate it high because it works as described and will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> This trimmer pulls the hairs. It is also a pain to operate using both hands.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but that&#x27;s how good this product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GroomMate is an elegant solution. Why use batteries if you don&#x27;t need to?  Why shove blades that spin at 500rpms up your sensitive nose?  These are questions worth asking, and GroomMate not only asked but answered the questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First though, I should address my biggest shock when opening the package.  This trimmer is smaller than a crayon.  This makes it great for throwing in a travel toiletries bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works effortlessly.  No pain, no pulled hairs.  No dead batteries!  Overall, the trimmer is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered directly through Groommate&#x27;s website since I live outside the US.  The original product got lost in a shipping or customs black hole.  I don&#x27;t blame Groommate for that, but their response was ridiculously slow.  Apparently their only email address on their website goes through aggressive spam protection.  Fortunately I caught someone in the office by phone late on a Saturday evening.  The guy who answered was great, asked me to wait a few more days and then he would issue a replacement shipped for free.  However, after that I went through 3 weeks of unanswered phone calls and emails.  Finally, about a month later, I got a friendly email response saying they would ship me a replacement.  I provided a US address and everything went smoothly.  That was a great resolution to the problem, I just wish it came quicker and easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, extremely pleased with the product and the end result.  I&#x27;m planning to give a few of these away as presents this coming Christmas.</li>
    <li> i bought this and worked for 3 days before it LOCKED up and would not rotate. Waste of money</li>
    <li> This little trimmer is simply the best.  As soon as it was un-packaged I was impressed with the cool factor - stainless steel, precision feel, nice weight.  It performs as well as it looks and feels.  Best part?  No battereis, ever.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is well made, and the only model that does not require batteries - so I gave it a three star rating for these attributes.  I guess if you don&#x27;t have access to a battery (maybe stranded on a desert island), this would be your choice.  Other than this, you won&#x27;t be happy.  This thing is awkward to use, and pulls hair out of your nose instead of cutting it.  The product is well made but poorly designed.    I originally bought it because I thought it would be good for travel.  Having used it several times though, I wish I had my money back.</li>
    <li> You can tell that this thing is built to last. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase again (although I know I&#x27;ll never need another one because this thing is SOLID).</li>
    <li> Over the last few years, I have purchased numerous nose and ear trimmers for my husband which didn&#x27;t work well, weren&#x27;t durable and were difficult to clean.  My daughter told me about this product.  She purchased it for her fiance so I thought I would see if this product was any better than previous trimmers we bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item is small, well made and easy to clean.  My husband travels a lot for work so he can easily pack it up and take it with him.  It doesn&#x27;t use batteries like his other ones and it actually performs better than all of the others we have purchased.  I wish I had known about this one sooner.</li>
    <li> Find it difficult to use.  Takes a lot of twisting to cut a few hairs.  Doesn&#x27;t cut any better than electric products in same price range.  The only real benefit is that theoretically it lasts a long time and you don&#x27;t need batteries.  I&#x27;m going back to my Panasonic battery trimmer with vacuum, works like a charm!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to it but so far I really like it. I wish it would trim a bit closer. Good product for anyone wanting to eliminate throw-away batteries from their lives.</li>
    <li> What a marvelous idea - non-battery operated nose-hair trimmer, had I known, I would have bought this years ago.  This is the 3rd nose-hair trimmer I&#x27;ve purchased, the very first one was a battery operated one that got wet one day and the battery leaked into the device and corroded it.  The second one I still have, but I&#x27;ve already replaced one corroded battery and I have to shake it or tap it on the counter to sometimes get the blades to start turning.    So now comes the Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose hair trimmer - a finely built precision instrument, just twist quickly back and forth and it works great.  The first time I used it, I was shocked by how much it cut and the included brush was pretty handy, I thought I had Grizzly Adams inside my nose.    The only observations (but this is still a 5 star product) are that the trimmer itself is stainless and has a metallic smell to it and well..you&#x27;re putting this up in your nose, so you can expect to really smell the metallic smell.  Also, the included brush is extremely useful, as I don&#x27;t like to get this trimmer wet (even though it is stainless steel), but I wish there was an integrated holder to hold the trimmer WITH the brush, as there is only a carrying case for the trimmer itself.  Ever so often I have to dig into the drawer to find the little brush.    My search for the ultimate nose hair trimmer is over and it is this non-battery stainless steel one!</li>
    <li> Recently purchased Groom Mate XL Hair Trimmer. While I don&#x27;t usually do reviews I thought that this product needed to be reviewed. In a word -useless-. This unit does not cut a hair of any type.  It has had some good reviews and that is why I bought it.  May be mine is just missing the cutting blade, but for whatever reason it is does absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> No pulling or pain, works great.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how people are complaining of pulling. I&#x27;ll admit I was apprehensive to use it at first, but it worked perfectly. Cuts well, no pain, and I don&#x27;t need to worry about batteries or having to replace it.</li>
    <li> Wow!  What a nifty little tool. A chunky piece of steel that gave me the fastest nose hair trim I&#x27;ve ever had (inluding a battery powered trimmer).  Hand operated (VERY easy to operate) and quiet.  Did I say fast?  Looks like it&#x27;ll last forever.</li>
    <li> I have been very satisfied with my purchase the Groom Mate is just what it was presented as when I researched it.  I would reccommend it to anyone.    Thanks</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer based on the glowing reviews here on Amazon. Good news and bad news.    Good: works as well or better than either of the two battery powered powered trimmers I&#x27;ve tried. Looks good, is small enough to fit easily in a portable toilet kit and doesn&#x27;t need batteries.    Bad: doesn&#x27;t trim  nose hair that well, and when it does it pulls (ouch) as much as cuts.  Using it carefully I&#x27;d say it gets 50-75% of what I&#x27;d like cut.     Conclusion: if you want your nose hair really trimmed get a blunt nosed scissors to trim with. If you are dead set on using a trimmer this may be your best option, but keep your expectations low.</li>
    <li> platinum xl works very well...  must move it slowly and gently inside nostril while turning base to minimize pulling of nose hair.  cuts clean without pain.  great product.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not much to say--it has one simple function and it does it well. The only two caveats: it seems like there&#x27;s always going to be a bit of hair stuck at the top even after running it under water. Unless you meticulously clean it with a tiny pipe cleaner, they&#x27;re stuck. Which might be a good reason to keep this hidden away or inside a container, since your wife or roommate might not appreciate looking at a gadget that has your nose-hairs stuck in the top of it.    The other thing is that while this has a lifetime manufacturer&#x27;s warranty...the manufacturer is in New Zealand! For the amount of money you&#x27;d pay to send it there for repair, you might as well buy another one! In any case, the construction is solid, and I imagine I would probably lose the thing in a move before it actually breaks.</li>
    <li> At first glance, this looks ready to be loaded into a large caliber rifle.    If you have a shorter girlfriend, she&#x27;d be wise to put this in your stocking. From their lower perspective, they are wise to the threatening thatch patch you have going on in your honker holster.    It seems an awkward tool, and it doesn&#x27;t trim quite as close my former nose-bush trimmer (Panasonic ER411), but it&#x27;s bomb-proof. I was satisfied with the former, but it&#x27;s easily breakable. I dropped it and it pushed in the metal cap that covers the blades and its now locked and nothing can fix it.    It&#x27;s also sleek, low profile and can be stored easily. Although if it&#x27;s in your carry-on, you&#x27;re likely to be stopped at airport security. Nothing a simple demonstration can&#x27;t handle.    Not so much a negative, but including a small brush to clean out debris would be a nice addition.    Hours of entertainment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to elaborate on the effectiveness of the trimmer.  Many other reviewers have done so, and needless to say, I agree with them.  It&#x27;s a great tool.    However, be careful if you are going to include this in your carry on items.  3 weeks ago, TSA shut down a line, and continued scanning my luggage.  They never said what they were looking for, but they kept looking.  20 minutes, and 3 TSA agents later, they found the &#x27;bullet&#x27; looking device.   I travel weekly, and have been doing so for months now.  And this has always been in my carry on.  But, lately they have been noticing it.    Just last week, it was flagged again.  Luckily they picked it right out of the bag and scanned it another time or two.  Then come back to me and said, \\&quot;We&#x27;re astonished, but you can have it\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I originally reviewed this product earlier in the summer and was a little turned off by it at the time.  In the meantime, the company contacted me and offered me a replacement as well as a trial of the new one-handed model.   After accepting the offer they arrived the next day, it&#x27;s almost like they drove them to my house, I was impressed.   The replacement was much much better and 100% effective.  The new one-handed model works equally as well.     I have to say, these guys went above and beyond and had an impressive level of commitment to customer satisfaction.   I would, without a doubt, recommend this product to anyone looking to get away from the expensive battery devouring skin biting electric models made by the other guys.   Plus these guys are trying real hard to make a good American product with quality and caring customer support.    Thanks Groommate and keep up the good work.    Henry    PS - I would have changed the start rating but Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow it. Thinking a 5 star rating now.</li>
    <li> Got it for my husband who says that it works really great. Trims without snagging hair. A perfect product. Well deserving of 5 stars. Yes, I would definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve now used this trimmer for 2 years. As mentioned elsewhere, it&#x27;s a quality-made product which is easy to use once you (rapidly) get the hang of the motions necessary. The basic flaw is one of design - which consists of a rotary knife inside a metal tube. The wall of the tube is none too thin, so the shortest you can cut the nose hair is about 1 mm.     Whether &#x27;tis more esthetic to have a lush foliage of hair peeking out of  your nose  Or mere millimeter stubs  Will condition your happiness with this product.  For my part, I will continue my search for the perfect trimmer...</li>
    <li> I ordered the groom mate because I was tired the the battery operated ones breaking after a short time. Once one gets use to the manual operation it dose as good or better job then the battery operated ones. It looks like it could last a liketime.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like having a yard man inside my nose!!!!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and does a great job trimming close in all the nooks and crannies of your snout.  Best part is the size and never needing to buy batteries.  As others have pointed out, getting the cut hairs out of the center cavity is a bit difficult.  I expect this to get easier as some of the lubrication washes away.  Overall, a well-made and highly effective purpose built tool.</li>
    <li> Hefty little device, almost like a short heavy rifle bullet.  It was tricky to use though.  As indicated, you need two hands and it also helps if you can see what you are doing - which is problematic sometimes.  It does not work well if you need to use it quickly, by feel or by a general \\&quot;move around and trim away\\&quot; type of operation.</li>
    <li> I was encouraged by the many positive reviews of this product but it simply did not work for me.  I could not trim the hair closely no matter what I did.  The product arrived immediately so this is not an issue with the company or its service.</li>
    <li> After a year of use, I started to have problems with the product. I contacted coustomer service and in no time, they resolved the problem.</li>
    <li> I went off of all the good reviews and bought this a few months ago. I regret the purchase. It is VERY tough to clean out and it does pull on hairs rather than cut them about half the time. I don&#x27;t like it. I can&#x27;t imagine how someone came up with this design and why so many people like it. It&#x27;s not very precise and it&#x27;s just awkard to operate. Rather, it takes a lot of time and effort to do what small scissors/trimmers can do.</li>
    <li> It does the job but I was a little disappointed to see that it leaves about 2-3mm length on the nose hair, being impossible to trim closer. Also after trimming it leaves very sharp ends which makes it uncomfortable to blow your nose. I would recommend this to whoever just wants to trim the hair sticking out of their nose but if you want a closer trimming this is not the right tool. I will probably try an electric one next. I am keeping this as a backup.</li>
    <li> This was completely and totally what it needed to be and nothing else.   Very functional and solid.  The only thing I worry about it how to get the little hairs that have been cut and stick on the inside of the mechanism but so far none of it has affected the performance.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing complicate about it. Just stick it in your nose and twist the little knob back and forth. It cuts, not pulls, the nose hair. Then rinse with hot water. Voila! I&#x27;m buying a second one when I finish with this write up. The other things I like about it are: 1) Not batteries or charging needed, 2) very small, could fit in your pocket and still have plenty of room, and 3) very easy to disassemble with only a few parts. I used to have one of the other battery powered trimmers. Never ever going back to that again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just received this product and have used it for 2 days, after ordering it with high hopes, and perhaps that&#x27;s why I was a tad disappointed. After my 2nd Panasonic just died, I was intrigued when I found this battery-free, sturdy mechanical device, and the possible prospect of this being the last ear &amp; nose hair trimmer I&#x27;d ever need to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the positives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably true that it&#x27;s the last trimmer of this sort I will ever *need* to buy. Need being the operative word here. Not only does it carry a lifetime warranty, but it&#x27;s so sturdy and well-constructed that I can easily envision it lasting a lifetime. And there is the convenience of being able to do your major trimming without a battery operated device. For sure, it will *painlessly* remove your longest and most intrusive, unruly hairs in your ears &amp; nose. It definitely does the job and works effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the last trimmer I will ever *want* to buy, because while it does the job in terms of removing the major hairs, it simply does not cut close enough, and not as close as the Panasonic battery trimmers I&#x27;ve used. That&#x27;s actually the only negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positives far outweigh the single negative (lack of closeness), but for me, that&#x27;s a big negative--I need closeness since I am not that hairy. I will happily keep this product forever, but I think I will also have to use a Panasonic battery device for those times when I really want to get a close cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note about the company that makes/sells them. THEY SHIP FAST! I sent a follow up inquiry 36 hours after ordering, asking them to expedite the order since I was traveling overseas. Just a few hours later, I received a pleasant personal response telling me it was shipped the day before! Nice. That means they shipped less than 12 hours after I placed my order! He even wished me a pleasant trip. I really like buying from good companies with good people like this. Their customer service solidified 4 stars for my rating..</li>
    <li> First let me start by saying that I have owned several of the battery powered nose hair trimmers in the past with mixed results; I decided to purchase this one based on the number of positive reviews; I was a bit skeptical at first because this does require two hands to operate BUT do not let that deter you! This is an amazing device! It is small, portable and strong! It has a little weight so you know it&#x27;s not some cheap toy and it really feels great in your hand! The two hand movement actually feels more comfortable than the other brands and models. All men need to be conscious of their grooming and this is one of those indispensable items that should be a part of everyone&#x27;s medicine box;</li>
    <li> It does not require batteries &amp; there is nothing that can easily go bad but the performance to say the least is poor.  I will not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Who needs waterboarding, just use my old electric nose hair trimmer on anyone and they&#x27;ll tell you anything after they&#x27;re done screaming in agony.  I didn&#x27;t know there was anything else out there until I saw the reviews for this product on Amazon and asked myself, \\&quot;can 300+ people be wrong?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can read other great reviews of this product, but let me emphasize that it gets the job done with ZERO pain.  I love this so much that I purchase them as gifts for my man-friends.  Extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> This product had some fairly decent reviews, but my experience was not impressive. Forget the fact that it is awkward to position in your nostrils. The main problem is that it takes a lot of effort to get even one hair removed. If you have loads of patience and time you&#x27;ll eventually get it to do the job but my recommendation is save your money.</li>
    <li> I have never purchased a nose hair trimmer before, so I have nothing to compare this to except bumbling around with my nail scissors trying to use them for this purpose.  This is the far superior method!  It is a sturdy, well-built device.  The simple twisting action you do with the lower section cuts the hair safely.  I am able to do a nice job on my nose hair quickly, painlessly and better than spending more time on the job with my little nail scissors.  You just give the tip a rinse with alcohol or water after use.  EASY!  I wish I would have had one of these years ago!  I expect this product to seriously last.  I love how well-made it seems to be.  I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> First of all, this is not electric. It&#x27;s just a revolving tube inside another tube with \\&quot;blades\\&quot; at the top. I need to continue to try to use it, but so far, it does not demonstrably remove nose hair.</li>
    <li> This is a fine product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this thing once since it takes a while for nose hairs to grow back to an unwelcomed length but I was extremely pleased when I did use it.  My only complaint is that I didn&#x27;t want to pay $20 for it, but the I haven&#x27;t seen anything this high quality for a long while.  It feels like it&#x27;ll last forever and I hope it does.</li>
    <li> I read the great reviews of this product and had to try it. I bought it back in July and was doing well the first few times I used it. Then for some reason, when I would twist it to use it, it would grab the nose hair, which was painful!!    I tried it one more time at another day after cleaning it and making sure nothing was stuck inside. It hurt again!    So on Sept 18, I went to the website and emailed customer service since they have a 100% money back guarantee. I stated my situation. I got an email back within an hour from John, the president of the company. He said,     \\&quot;I am really sorry to hear that you are experiencing a problem using your Groom Mate nose hair trimmer.  Ocassionally, the rotary blade system  will go out of alignment for any number of reasons including maybe banging up against a rigid surface and this will cause the trimmer to stop  turning smoothly.  We do offer an unconditional lifetime warranty with free product replacement on all of the trimmers that we manufacture.  I would like to know if you would like to receive a brand new Platinum XL (with no charge shipping) as well as one of our new leather pouches  with cleaning brushes.  If so, simply reply to this email and include your current mailing address and we will get it right out to you.\\&quot;     I wanted a refund but since so many people were happy with it. I emailed him back with my mailing address. That was on a Friday.     Today is Monday and I received the replacement! I was shocked by the speed! I have not tried out the replacement but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be better.     Just want to give 4 stars for the product cause the first few times I used it, it worked great.     I want to give 5 stars for customer service!!!</li>
    <li> After reading all the 5-star reviews I thought I would give this a try. This product (from other reviewers) seemed like the best thing since sliced bread. That isn&#x27;t the case. It pulls hairs, doesn&#x27;t have that flush cut and is a pain in the rear end to use. I&#x27;ve tried multiple times, so I would like to think I gave this product a try. NOT A 5-STAR as most have reviewed. I should trash it and stick to my cheapo battery powered trimmer I bought from Walmart. Readers, don&#x27;t believe the hype on this product. Something smells fishy and my review is true. Makes you wonder what can possibly make others give this a 5-star review. I can&#x27;t say I believe them not unless they got the product for free or they were paid to write gleaming reviews. I DUNNO.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a manual hair trimmer before, but I&#x27;m sold on this one.  The blades are sharp and it cuts well.  You stick it in, twist the bottom half and in just a few twists, you&#x27;re good to go - sans hair.</li>
    <li> Fake reviews strike again.  I thought I had ordered the Second Coming the way the reviewers carried on.  A little digging would have made that obvious so I take full responsibility for being conned.  Anyway, the Pros: Small, very well-made and very cool design.  Cons: Only consider this a \\&quot;con\\&quot; if you don&#x27;t like the idea of eyeballing a particular hair in your nose you want cut, then attempting to cut it with no real way to know if you cut it unless you go digging around looking for the same hair you thought maybe you cut.  Yeah, something like that.  It \\&quot;works\\&quot; but it&#x27;s no better than using little scizzors or break-after-two-months electric trimmers.  Overall I&#x27;d say while electric trimmers do a better job, they always break on me, which causes me to rage like a maniac.  This thing will at least last forever.  Blah.</li>
    <li> It does the job, but slowly.  It is definitely easy to get into those tight corners in the nose. Although lately I have just been pulling the hairs out with my fingers.  May seem painful, but a lot quicker and efficient.</li>
    <li> I have owned several battery operated nose hair trimmers in the past with the expectation that they need to be replaced every 3 to 5 years.  Even the one from the Sharper Image eventually died.  I was looking for a new trimmer and came across the Groom Mate Platinum XL.  It looked simple enough and after giving it a try I have to say it works great, is simple to use, and I can&#x27;t see how it will ever need to be replaced.  It is heavy and well made for such a small object and only takes a few minutes to figure out how to use the device.  I wish I had thought of it!  Don&#x27;t hesitate, give it a try.  It is a little more tricky to trim ear hairs but only because you can&#x27;t really see what you are doing . . . no different if it was battery operated.</li>
    <li> This is a manual (finger operated) nose and ear hair cutter. Slow but relatively effective - nicely machined. Twist the base and the cutters rotate slowly and any hairs that happen to fall within its cutters will be sheared. Only rarely, will you feel any pulling of hairs - the blades seem quite sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is quite slow compared to a battery operated device but after my Panasonic battery operated cutter failed after only a few uses, I decided a manual cutter was the better alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the quality of the machining - this little device may last a lifetime. It&#x27;s made of stainless steel. Yes: It is slow, Yes: It may occasionally pull a hair or two but it works and it was designed and manufactured with considerable care. I should add that at times it can be quite difficult to position this device while still being able to twist the base. So it is hardly ideal but there is little doubt that it will work reliably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not aware of any electric cutter that will last. Check out the reviews of electrical cutters here on Amazon - they often fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d happily pay $50.00 or more for a quality electric cutter but they don&#x27;t seem to exist. Given that fact - this little MANUAL cutter may be your best choice for personal grooming. I still look forward to a reliable electric cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (March 2010): 4 months after I purchased this cutter I have once again purchased another electric cutter simply because I was so frustrated with this manual cutter. While this manual cutter works - it is quite slow and difficult to position while still being able to turn the knob at the end of the unit. Nevertheless I&#x27;ll always have it as a back-up. Time will tell whether my new electric cutter will last beyond a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (April 2012) I have not used this cutter in a few years. While nicely machined it is too difficult to position while still being able to turn the knob at the back of the unit. I&#x27;ve gone back to a battery operated cutter.o a battery operated cutter.</li>
    <li> Yes, its a torture device but thats why women so to salons!  I wouldnt let her near me with this but she has a salon and other women volunteer for it!</li>
    <li> No batteries, no cords, nothing extra needed. All you do is hold the top half to your hairs, and twist the bottom half to cut the hairs. Great and ingenius product!</li>
    <li> Sometimes people are upset without knowing it when they purchase a really small item.  Somehow they think because it is not heavy that it should be free.  This is worth every penny.  It is tiny but it is many times more reliable than the battery powered models.  I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews.  Mine works fine on all the nose and ear hair.  It can even be used one handed.  I don&#x27;t know why men get more nose and ear hair as we age but since we do I am glad to have given the Groom Mate a try.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to take care of pesky hairs the scissor wasn&#x27;t great at reaching.  When I saw the Groom Mate Platinum XL I was skeptical since it looks enormous in the picture.  Then it came in the mail.  I was shocked at how small the package was and when I opened it I realized that it&#x27;s actually the exact size you see in the picture.  That&#x27;s how big it really is!  I opened it, ran it under warm water to cleanse it, and dried it off.  All you do is hold it with two hands, insert it into your nostril or ear, and twist the bottom/top so that the blades start cutting the hairs.  It&#x27;s so simple!  It doesn&#x27;t even need batteries.  You&#x27;ll never cut yourself with this, pull your hair, or worry again!  I&#x27;ve been using this now for about a month and I&#x27;m truly satisfied.  It does the job and does it well.  Thanks Groom Mate!</li>
    <li> just to clarify (since i&#x27;ve noticed some reviewers claiming &#x27;bogus&#x27; posts/reviews) i am a real person and this is my real experience w/ this product.  i bought this trimmer mainly based on the number of great reviews it had received.  i literally used it twice and it was unusable after its second use.  it wouldn&#x27;t turn anymore and it seemed to have just locked up on me.  i tried w/ all my power to get this thing to turn and it just wouldnt cooperate anymore.   i figured a just got a lemon and didnt bother to used it anymore.  obviously i would not recommend this product and if i could give it zero stars i would.</li>
    <li> This is not exactly as advertised.  It is much better!  Having used a few electrics, expensive to cheap, not one compares with this instrument.  Never a pull or jerk (except me).  You never know it&#x27;s cutting anything.  The first couple of twists you probably aren&#x27;t!  But when you figure it out you will love it, if you have used any electric previously to compare it with.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000EBFJXS Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimming nose hair is not the most glamorous activity in the world but a necessary one.  You get to the age where you must do it or you risk looking like one of the animals in the wild.  I have tried battery operated nose hair trimmers that took longer than expected with frustrating results, even the with expensive ones.  I usually had to resort to using regular nose hair trimmer scissors because the hair on the sides would not be trimmed.  The Groom Mate Platinum XL is worth every penny.  It works by rotating the latter half of the device and maneuvering the trimmer side to side.  The blades are so sharp that at first I did not think it was working.  Simply stated, the Platinum XL works fantastic.  The best part is that I trim less often because the trimmer works so well.  At first I was leery on using a non-battery operating trimmer but this is the best trimmer available at any price.  Plus, the company is the type of company you want to support.  They are personal in their feedback and really care about customer feedback.  They are a good company where products are made in the great USA.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a well built tool that does the job it was intended for. It is simple to use and quick to clean. I am very pleased with this product and I expect to keep mine for a lifetime.</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer based on reviews I read and hopes of a quality product.  When it came I was not disappointed.  It functioned so well and smooth I felt I truly got a well made product.  I left the trimmer on my granite dining table for my wife to see and when she opened it to look at it, she dropped it on the table and unfortunately slightly bent the cutting teeth on the outside of the XL.  I was very disappointed.  I wrote an e-mail to John Bellm, the president of Bei-PHR Systems.  I explained the situation in detail and he wrote back in about an hour or two and told me he was sending me a replacement unit at no cost because there is a no questions asked, unconditional lifetime guarantee.  It came express mail 1 1/2 days later.  I was blown away.  The trimmer works, but you have to get used to it.  I found I had to hold it in one place, turn the bottom, then move on to the next spot but not while I am turning.  I suspect people who claim it pulled hairs, were moving it as they were turning it.  I like to think I am a smart shopper and an educated person, I can fully appreciate this trimmer and how John stands behind his product.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about using a trimmer that required both hands. But it is actually quite easy to use. I like the fact that it does not require power and should not wear out. I have previously owned two electric trimmers that worked well initially, but only lasted a few years. I see no reason why this one should not last indefinitely.</li>
    <li> This is by FAR the best nose/ear hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.    It is precision machined, solid, simple. As you turn the base your unwanted hairs are mercilessly cut down offering no resistance. It never jams pulls or tweaks, no hairs will pass through it un-cut.    There is no way you could be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best of the best nose and ear hair trimmers. I am sorry that I waited until I&#x27;m 59 years old to have discovered this tool. It is very sharp and doesn&#x27;t pull your hairs out but cuts them. My wife gets a kick out of me when I am using it because you do need to use two hands and I can see her point when I have watched myself in a mirror. But she does aprecaite the fact that I care enough not to have hair growing out of my nose and ears. Lets face it guys after about the age of 40 more hair grows there then on top of our heads unless you are a former governor of Illinois. I rate the Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer as a true five star product that is made right here in the U.S.A.</li>
    <li> There are no batteries and no cord. It is a cylindrical scissors. You rotate the handle and the blades cut whatever hair is next to it. It is stainless steel for easy cleaning. I&#x27;ve used it once and loved how easy it was to do the job. I have used battery opperated nose hair trimmers in the past and found the vibration makes me sneeze. That made for a messy and an unsatisfying chore. On the other hand, the Groom Mate Platinum XL made it easy to make things nice and neat.</li>
    <li> Saw several positive reviews on the Groom Mate Platinum XL so i thought   i&#x27;d give it a try.  The unit arrived promptly and seems like a quality  made product.  The problem is that the unit is operated through and with  the use of both hands.  It can cut, but does NOT get very close.  For   someone with a nose full of hair and who hasn&#x27;t trimmed much, it will  improve your situation.  However, if you are hairy and wish to get somewhat  closer, this unit is NOT for you.   It should clearly state that it is NOT  battey and a manual unit in the description.  To the best of my knowledge  this is not the case.      Quality 9/10  Fast delivery 9/10  Got what was expected 1/10</li>
    <li> IT does a great job on shorter hairs, but not so good with slightly longer ones, you&#x27;ll still need to manually hit some areas.</li>
    <li> I first heard of this trimmer on this board while looking for a replacement for my latest, dead, electric trimmer. I was skeptical that such a simple and non-motorized device could work. Yeah....it works...and better than any electrical trimmer I have owned.    Pros:  Quality Construction: Solid; Stainless Steel.  Simplicity: No cords; no batteries; a simple turn of the handle really does do the job.  Portability: Toss it in your pocket or overnight bag.    Cons:  None. Other than it&#x27;s small enough to get lost. I will order another just in case!</li>
    <li> I was very intrigued when I saw this trimmer. I have to say, it really works. It really convenient, small, cheap and doesn&#x27;t require batteries.    Nothing else to say but thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> I bought this item and than canceled it when I found out it was not battery operated and it had to be done by hand. I would buy this in a heartbeat if it was battery operated. Perhaps I will get lucky in the future.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews on this product good and bad.I ordered april 12 and recived product the next day april 13 I was surprised.This product does exactly what they say it will I got it from the mail and used it right then. after reading all the reviews did not know what to expect.It did not pull or cut did a good job.It does not cut as close as electric trimmer, does a nice neat job.I would buy this product again very well made.</li>
    <li> I have had an electric nose hair trimmer in the past that worked fine but eventually conked out.  I replaced it with the Groom Mate and am happy that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-No batteries&lt;br /&gt;-Very small and easy to travel with&lt;br /&gt;-Seems extremely well made, heavy and sturdy&lt;br /&gt;-Hasn&#x27;t pulled any hair or caused any pain for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t cut all the hairs down to the side of your nose if that is what you want.  I just like things trimmed so there is nothing noticeable or hanging out, I&#x27;m not trying to cut every hair in my nose, so this really isn&#x27;t a con for me.&lt;br /&gt;-May take slightly longer than an electric model (not much).</li>
    <li> most horrible nose trimmer ever. it ripped at all my hairs in the most painful way. Good for torture though. I threw it in the trash. Bought the panasonic.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a glamorous item to own, but guys over the age of 25 or so definitely need to have one. I&#x27;ve tried a variety of the battery-powered devices over the years, and while they worked fine with some patience, they required a lot of in-and-out because the openings for hair are so small to keep from nicking your skin with the spinning blade. The openings here are larger, so all of your hair is easily in the way of the blade, and you&#x27;re in complete control of the blade so you can stop if you feel anything pinching (I never have). It takes literally 5 seconds a week for me to do this, while it used to take 30 seconds or a few minutes to get those random long hair to get caught in the tiny slot of battery-powered trimmers. I never feel pulling with this, either, and I certainly felt that from time to time with other devices. This thing is built like a tank, I have no doubt it will last for years and years. I&#x27;m giving some as gifts now because they are so great and most guys don&#x27;t know there is a better, cheaper option than the $20 electric trimmers sold at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> I actually thought that this product was electronic. But, it&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s manual.  That initially made me a little bit afraid to use it.  But, after I did - it was great!  It did not pull my nose hairs at all.    So...great purchase!</li>
    <li> It works very well.  Extremely well built.  But you need to understand that it takes a little work and time, just a minute or so.  It will be with me for lifetime!</li>
    <li> I just received my groom mate and used it on my nose and it worked great.  The no-batteries idea is great--it is solidly constructed, can get wet, and will never lose power and painfully pull at hairs rather than cutting them.  I would say absolutely get this rather than any battery-powered trimmer that will wear out in a year or dangerous scissors.</li>
    <li> I bought this item 3 1/2 years ago and have found it wanting in removing hair from my nose and ears.  It&#x27;s time consuming as you keep twisting the trimmer to try to cut the hairs.  I have found that after using it, there is still plenty of hair to remove.  For the same money, I strongly recommend the [[ASIN:B000FYVOJC Panasonic ER430K Vacuum Nose/Facial Hair Trimmer, Black]] which works much better.  The only advantage that this trimmer has is that it is very light weight and compact.  The ER430 is bigger and weighs more, but with that heft you get a much better product.</li>
    <li> Works well; first time I tried it I snipped the inside of my nose a bit but after getting the hang of it I don&#x27;t have any problems now. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> excellent product - very well made.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and just what I wanted.  Works well!</li>
    <li> The only real arguments we have is over the forest growing out of his nose!  Finally a product that does not pinch or pull.  I can actually mention weeding out the schnozzola without getting a pained sideways glance!  Good product!</li>
    <li> Cannot believe it gets such a high score! It pulls hairs which hurts and it&#x27;s difficult to reach all areas. After this is decided to try Philips Norelco NT9110 Precision Nose and Ear Trimmer - it appeared to be cheaper and doing a much better job!</li>
    <li> This trimmer is great.  Does not hurt at all.  Very easy to use and compact.  Worth the purchase price.  Shipping was quick and item was well packaged.</li>
    <li> I got this because of the great reviews. Those reviews are true. It works, it&#x27;s quick, it doesn&#x27;t hurt (98% of the time), it&#x27;s easy to clean, and it&#x27;s as sturdy as a racehorse&#x27;s butt. If you are nose-hair conscientious, buy this now.</li>
    <li> This thing sliced the inside of my nostrils resulting in bloody noses for a week.  Not exactly sure how I could&#x27;ve possibly been misusing this fairly simply device, but I&#x27;m quite certain it is not intended to draw blood.  Frankly, I&#x27;m afraid to use it at this point and will be purchasing an electric.  Good day sir.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband when he had to return one he purchased because it didn&#x27;t work.  He loves it.  Says it&#x27;s nice and sharp and he figures with no batteries, it should last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> Although this item is definitely sturdy and works, it will pinch if used too close to the interior lining.  So the product was tossed on the pile with the other rejected trimmers. The Philips Norelco NT9110 Precision Nose and Ear Trimmer was my husband&#x27;s favorite. I suppose he may try to use the Groom Mate again if we temporarily don&#x27;t have a replacement battery available. If you hate buying batteries, this could be the ideal product as long as you are extra careful how you position it.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS ALMOST WHAT I&#x27;M LOOKING FOR. WOULD LIKE TIGHTER TOLERANCES ON THE CUTING HEAD SO AS TO NOT MISS ANYTHING.   THANKS</li>
    <li> feels solid, unlike my previous automatic panasonic whose blades are thin and feel shaky. overall, does the job well.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying a cheap electronic (disposable) trimmer. Buy this and keep it for life.  Just don&#x27;t drop it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t trim as closely as I hoped, but I suppose it&#x27;s too difficult to make such a thing and be safe at the same time. Overall, very good trimmer.</li>
    <li> I have had the electric nose trimmers in the past. Most were either cheap and broke or they pinched your skin. Although this one is manual, you use no electicity or batteries which make it a Green item in my book and is sturdy and looks like it will last a lifetime. It won&#x27;t be going into a landfill either. Easy to hide or travel with since it is small and come with a small case.    Everyone should have one, both men and women. It works well in the ears too.</li>
    <li> I got a Platinum XL nose hair trimmer about two years ago after being frustrated by the electric ones that didn&#x27;t seem to work very well AND pulled my nose hairs uncomfortably - watery eyes and all that.  A simple, non-electric option seemed like a great idea, and sure enough, it worked great for a while, but then for some reason it lost the ability to spin (this may have been from me dropping it on my ceramic tile bathroom floor, although I&#x27;m honestly not sure).  I put off dealing with it for a while, thinking \\&quot;lifetime guarantee, sure, whatever, i&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get a hassle about it.\\&quot;  not at all.  i sent an email to the company explaining and got a return email in less than 24 hours telling me that they&#x27;d put a new one in USPS the next day.  They did, and I got it today, and I&#x27;m just as happy with it as I ever was.  Not to mention I&#x27;ll happily do business with this company again, as finding a company that honors their commitments seems to get more and more rare in this day and age.  Cheers to BEI - they have a customer for life.</li>
    <li> I hate to say but I think most of the other reviews are bogus. This device is not that great. Here is what sucks about it:    - requires two hands to operate  - blades work, but sometimes will pull  - very difficult if not impossible to clean - yes you can rinse it under water, but it does not flush out  - the ends are have a lot of sharp points so better be careful    I actually bought this and used it for a couple years. I just ordered a bettery powered one and wished that I had done that a long time ago.</li>
    <li> After months of using it I&#x27;ve decided I hate this dumb thing.  My nose isn&#x27;t all that hairy to begin with but I&#x27;m very particular about hygiene and body grooming so nose hair trimming is a must.  First of all, this compact little device can easily turn itself into a torture device that will rip your nose hair out so painfully that you&#x27;ll have tears in your eyes.  It&#x27;s like when you&#x27;re eating something really tasty and suddenly CHOMP CHOMP on your lip or tongue.  Not the end of the world but damn it that hurts.  Muy no bueno.  Second of all, I don&#x27;t find this pain stick to be faster or more efficient than any of the electric trimmers I&#x27;ve used.  In fact I find that the last electric trimmer I had did a far superior job of trimming the hairs shorter.  Maybe I&#x27;ll keep this trimmer for my travel kit for emergency use but for every day use I&#x27;m looking into a new electric trimmer.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  I&#x27;ve read a lot of the Amazon reviews of this product, and I have had none of the issues that some have had with this product.</li>
    <li> The trimmer cuts the hair fine, but is painful. Pulls the hair and can cut you. I tried it twice and was really careful. It hurt me both times, drew blood once. Not worth using.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly. It&#x27;s basically indestructible. It&#x27;s small. It&#x27;s quiet. It doesn&#x27;t need batteries or charging. What more could you want?</li>
    <li> My experience with this trimmer has been that if I stick it into my nose and twirl I can feel when it cuts a hair, there&#x27;s a gentle and non-painful tug as it snips off the hair.  But I can&#x27;t just blindly move it around and get all the hair cut.  I have to be somewhat deliberate to aim it at particular hairs and move it around until I feel the hair get cut.  Overall I&#x27;m quite happy with it.  Cleaning is easy, the trimmer comes with a little brush that easily sweeps the cut hair out of the center of the trimmer.</li>
    <li> This device is nice and made in the USA.  It is your patriotic duty to clip you unwanted hair and keep an American company in business.</li>
    <li> Much better than other battery operated trimmers that do not even start to turn after far too short a time.</li>
    <li> ... to buy one of these things the necessity of which manifests my advancing years, I found it to be a precision piece of equipment that works quite well.  It fits easily into a shaving kit, is easy to clean, and doesn&#x27;t require electricity.  I see that giving it five stars means I love it, but I don&#x27;t really think that&#x27;s an accurate reflection of how I feel about this gadget; better to say it does the job with a quiet and smooth action, so far has involved no pain or complications, and feels sturdy enough that I probably won&#x27;t need to replace it.</li>
    <li> Have not used any of the electric trimmers out there but have read many disappointing reviews.  This simple yet elegantly designed tool is quite good at what it does.  Easy to use and hard to break.  If asked I would recommend this to a friend or family member.</li>
    <li> This product is beautifully made. It is a pleasure to hold in your hand. It just doesn&#x27;t actually cut hairs. I&#x27;ve tried various options for how to rotate the blades. In all cases my nose and ear hairs were simply trapped between the blades and I had to pull them out. Not pleasant but effective for getting rid of the hairs. But definitely not what I had in mind. I have a cheap electric cutter that actually cuts... can&#x27;t figure out why this solidly consructed and relatively expensive version doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Very good tool helping all you mature males from looking like a beast, unless you have no problem with nostrils hair cause you are from Sweden. Perfectly machined, appears CNC job, stainless, lath cut center with milled blades, will take hours to plan and make, here it is at cool price. Forget those battery run trash and disposable gizmos. Simple, quiet, intelligent, working and easy to maintain, your uncivilized look nostrils hair remover is here. Need I say more? Ladies - here is your X-mass gift for the man you cherish out there that will make use of good humour and give it practical use as well. Simple things are what life is all about.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten better trims (Ear and nose) from much cheaper electric alternatives, and with less pain.</li>
    <li> I am a female and this device works GREAT in removing my “old lady” nose hairs!  It trims MUCH better and CLOSER than my old battery operated nose hair trimmer that bit the dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the people who complained about it “yanking” a few of their nose hairs, it CAN do that, if your nose hair is thick and/or long.  Once you “mow” down your initial giant nose hairs, it works without yanking.  Besides, I&#x27;m used to having to “pluck” my nose hairs that my battery operated nose hair trimmer missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the people who complained about it cutting their nose:  WARNING:  The Platinum XL is a STURDY, WELL MADE, 100% STAINLESS STEEL, PRECISION TOOL that should only be used by adults who understand the concept of inserting “very sharp, rotating blades” into their nostrils.  If your only experience with very sharp objects is a safety razor or a self-inflicted paper cut, this product may not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I HIGHLY recommend the Platinum XL!</li>
    <li> First of all, the customer service is exceptional when ordering from the manufacturer.  The device itself is small - maybe 3.5 inches long, and is well made of machined aluminium.  It requires both hands, as you twist the bottom/top in opposite directions, causing the cutter to rotate.  Is very sharp and easy to use - have used Grundig and Panasonic in the past, both of which died relatively quickly - no more than 2 years on the Grundig, less for the Panasonic.  None cut so well as does this one, were much larger (Battery operated, I admit).  If you are looking for quality and something that will last for years, look no further.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t quite like this type of nose hair cutter. Maybe its is my personal view but the manual type I found a bit to much. Having to use two hands was clumsy. This had a good blade on it and it cut well. Just not my cup of tea.</li>
    <li> only used it a few times in the past 6 months but beats the hell out of my old battery one that worked like crap, takes about a minute to get used to then it&#x27;s perfect. built to last is solid metal feels heavy for it&#x27;s size and not cheap at all. deffinitly a keeper &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> i was skeptical to purchase this since it doesn&#x27;t have a motor or anything electric to power it...it&#x27;s SO AWESOME and is FINALLY the tool i need to \\&quot;manscape\\&quot; my hubby...very durable and kinda heavy</li>
    <li> A well-crafted item of substance. Holding it, you know immediately that made to last. It is satisfying to have a good tool that doesn&#x27;t need to be plugged in. It will pull hairs if you push before the hair that has been engaged is cut. What else would you expect? Twirl and advance.</li>
    <li> I had the battery trimmer and it never worked right and made alot of noise.This trimmer is quick and easy with a life time guarenty</li>
    <li> It was serving ok as a nose hair trimmer for a while. I accidently dropped it in the sink, now it won&#x27;t rotate at all. Not worth it if it can&#x27;t take a simple drop in the sink.  Update: Going to have to increase the stars on this review. Contacted the company with my issue, and they took care of me very quickly. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> DO NOT PURCHASE unless you want to stand there and ROTATE THE BASE of the trimmer while inserted into nostrils.  Like a manual rotary mower-- HORRIBLE.</li>
    <li> I have used the trimmer twice since I received it. It appears to be very well made. It did OK in trimming. It was hard to get a good ear trim but after a while, finally did the job. Because it turns by your fingers, it is slower than others that I have used with batteries. I never found a battery operated one that would not just kill the batteries after a couple of times.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money on those stupid electric grooming pieces of garbage. Buy this instead. I&#x27;ve seen some people complain that this hurts when you use it. I haven&#x27;t noticed this at all. Maybe they need to grow a pair? This is a product for a man yo and it feels like its going to last until the day they bury me.</li>
    <li> I used this trimmer for the first time last night. It worked great for me. It did the job fast and painlessly. The small cleaning brush that came with it is a plus too. I had to brush off the hair after each spin. I wan to take care of this thing.    I was a little worried based on the reviews I read on here saying that this thing would pull and tug on your hair. Luckily, I had no such issues. It was smooth and easy for me. The build quality seems good too (It doesn&#x27;t feel like a cheap product).    This will be my stocking stuffer for Christmas to all my brothers, haha!    The only reason I see for buying this again is if I lose it. And I will definitely buy this again if that happens.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work \\&quot;as well\\&quot; as an electric, but still works just fine, and seems to be a very solid construction, so don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll ever break. Also like it doesn&#x27;t have batteries from a robustness and sustainable standpoint.</li>
    <li> I was awaiting this trimmer, and had high expectations of it due to its high rating and reviews. Sadly the $8 trimmer I bought at my exchange works much better than this piece of scrap metal. I would give it zero stars but because it made to last, I&#x27;ll cut it some slack. But highly disappointed. Simple as that.</li>
    <li> Your kids kids will be able to use this super high quality nose hair trimmer, kinda gross but factual. It even looks elegant for a classy guy that does not mind putting in a few seconds of manual labor just like a real man should. Forget all the electrical trimmers that short out, don&#x27;t charge, or stop working after one single use. This trimmer will keep you classy.</li>
    <li> When I got the package, the thing felt like it was going to be huge and rather concerning to be shoving into anything.  Once you get it out of the tube, though, it&#x27;s much smaller.  A little larger than the head of the battery trimmer, but not uncomfortably so.  Still, this thing is tiny, and would almost seem too small if not for the fact that small makes it extremely useful for travel carry.  Highly recommended for that purpose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of comfort, I find it much more so than the battery trimmers that just feel bizarre to use.  If you turn it too fast, I can see how you could easily pull a hair rather than cut it, but the thing is plenty sharp, so just take your time with it and that will not be a problem.  It doesn&#x27;t take any more time to do that than to try and rush through the procedure and it is a lot less unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very well made, much better than the battery trimmers at the same price point, that&#x27;s for sure.  I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else now, and with the excellent responsiveness of the seller, I have absolutely no trouble suggesting you do not hesitate to order this product, from this seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this trimmer.  It&#x27;s easy to use, simple to clean, works well (just clear any boogz before you start trimming, for best results), and is built with very high quality and precision.  Very little pull, no pinching as long as you pay attention, and it feels smooth in your hands while spinning each end.    Plus, it comes with a lifetime guarantee.  I dropped one onto hard tile, and the teeth bent and it didn&#x27;t spin smoothly anymore.  I e-mailed the company, and they sent a replacement right away.  I use the precision trimming blade on a Gilette Fusion to get the parts of my nostrils that are exposed, then clean up the rest with my GroomMate.  This could easily be the last nosehair trimmer you ever need to buy...works great, lasts long, and has a great company standing by it if there&#x27;s any issue.  Leaves your nose so pretty, everyone will pick it for their favorite.</li>
    <li> Simple and works. Very small and portable, sharp blades, I use it as a travel companion as opposed to battery one</li>
    <li> I bought one of these and it worked great until I dropped it on a ceramic tile floor and it went out of round. No problem, the manufacturer has a lifetime warranty and sent me a new one. They were pleasant and helpful. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Works great, and will never need a batt.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking at the plastic case version, chose this one. The plastic one will cut you.</li>
    <li> Very impressive. Did exactly what was described in the ad. Also, great service! Would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Doe&#x27;s exactly what it was made to do!</li>
    <li> Had I read the copy more thoroughly, I probably would have bought the battery powered trimmer that I ended up purchasing from a local salon supply store.  However, since I didn&#x27;t read the copy more thoroughly, I purchased this perfectly crafted little piece of high-tech engineering.  I marvel at its design and then realized it was not battery-powered.  I wondered how I was ever going to trim ear hair using both hands in the process.  (Maybe a possibility for someone with more delicately proportioned hands?)  Nonetheless, I found the object of such well-designed beauty that it sits on top of my dresser in clear view for my viewing pleasure.  For trimming, I have a Wahl hair and ear nose trimmer which I can use with one hand and easily access my ears.</li>
    <li> I had a cheap electric nose hair trimmer that never worked particularly well.  It was surprisingly difficult to get the hairs to wander inside the housing to where the spinning blades lived.    So I found this little guy on amazon, and was skeptical.  How could a hand-turned razor be better than an electric one?  Wouldn&#x27;t it tend to pull on the hairs from the slower speed?  Still, the reviews were good, so I gave it a shot.    I am now a believer.  Nothing, neither my old electric trimmer nor the tiny pair of scissors I own, has ever done as good a job of taming the shrubbery growing out of my schnoz.  On top of that, no need for batteries, it seems to clean easily, and the packaging boasts of a lifelong warranty.      You twist the bottom half of the shank to spin the blades.  It twists fairly easily, and you don&#x27;t even have to twist it that quickly.    I&#x27;ve had a single hair get pulled.  I was lowering the trimmer from my nose, and the hair must have been at ju-u-st the right point to be half-cut and gripped by the blades.  Since then, I make sure that I keep operating the blades as I take it away from my face and it&#x27;s never happened again.</li>
    <li> Didnt like it because it takes a lot of time to trim hair in its way. Very Rarely using it.</li>
    <li> it is so nice to never need batteries and it works great !</li>
    <li> Maybe the glowing reviews are from people who have been struggling along with scissors or a really poorly designed battery trimmer.  The Groom Mate is certainly solidly built, heirloom quality maybe, it just doesn&#x27;t function very well.  Awkward to use, difficult to trim closely, easy to miss hairs, and sometimes painful, it just does not deserve the praise.  I am now shopping for another battery model a few months after buying the Groom Mate.  I&#x27;m sorry I let myself be swayed by the other glowing reviews for the Hummer of nose hair trimmers.</li>
    <li> I love this small trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never used manual Grooming things before.&lt;br /&gt;but, It&#x27;s not. what I want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do order,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even I&#x27;m not relatives or fridely with seller,&lt;br /&gt;I like it, I love it, if it made in USA, China. such as APPLE do MADE IN CHINA&lt;br /&gt;Good Idea, Make it good business if you agree&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciated to seller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Willaim</li>
    <li> No cheap plastic nose hair yanker here.  This is a precision made instrument, and that was a big problem when it slipped out of the plastic tube storage capsuel and dropped 3 feet to my tile floor bathroom.  My fault, but jamed forever  The challange was that it is made in 2 pieces with the collection of interior round blades spinning against the outer circle blades to do their job.  When it dropped, one of the outer circle blades was bent ever so slightly in toward the path of the inner blade unit.  That was enough to jam the rotation of the inner blades that were not unable to get past the one bent in outer blade that was now blocking teh path of the smooth rotation.  Is this a reason not to buy it?  Not in the least. Even though it can painfully get hung up on a nose hair or two as you manually spin it [no need for batteries] to get the job done, it is absolitely 100% better than the cheap plastic jobs. It was a gift and when I went to replace it on line I was amazed that it was not at least $40!  I ordered a replacement right away!  Every guy over 21 needs some kind of tool for good hair grooming. This is the best I have had and was given to me by my young son who has one of his own.</li>
    <li> all I expected. works fine.</li>
    <li> Great little gadget, got the hang of it quickly and never realised how small it was. Fantastic. Highly recommended indeed.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to have a compact, high performing grooming tool I could take on business travels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is awful - instead of cutting hair, it snags the hair and rips most of them out.  Very painful and ineffective.</li>
    <li> The nose trimmer is much smaller and more rudimentary than i originally imagined. It gets its job done, you twist it to effect, but seems overall a cheap and basic product, not nearly worth the 20$ i paid. 5$ maybe as a cheap pocket throw away item. It does work though.</li>
    <li> No batteries needed to cut your nose hair- it&#x27;ll last forever.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Precision machined parts.  Good design.  Fast delivery from Groom Mate</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a solid nose hair trimmer for a long time and have been through three electric nose hair trimmers in the past two years. I find that all of the electronic nose hair trimmers that I have used all have the same style blade that is really low grade and doesn&#x27;t do a great job of actually cutting my thick nose hairs. This tiny non electric nose hair trimmer blew my expectations out of the water and has easily done the best job trimming my nose hairs. Compared to all of the nose hair trimmers, which were all electronic, I have attempted using in the past the Groom Mate Platinum XL is by fair the most well built, easy to clean, and does the best job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought this I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure how it worked but really its easy once you get it. Simply insert the Groom Mate into your nostril, hold the top portion with one hand, and with your other hand twist in a circular motion each direction. Before you know it no more nose hairs! :)</li>
    <li> This unit works just as advertised. I suggest spinning the blade fast to reduce snagging hairs. I haven&#x27;t tried to trim nose hair yet. I am still getting used to trimming ear hair while using both hands with this unit. I just bought an electric trimmer that does not trim close enough to the skin. And of the several electric ones I&#x27;ve owned, just ONE drop and it&#x27;s busted forever! I definitely recommend this product. It is a solid unit that works very well.</li>
    <li> I used to have a cheap battery operated groomer and got sick of always replacing the battery. It was huge and clunky and the motor was weak (running on 1 AA battery).    I looked for a new nose hair trimmer on Amazon and this was consistently the best rated one.    I ordered 2 one for myself and one for my dad.     So far, I really like it! It&#x27;s small and easy to use. No battery needed, you just turn the bottom portion of the groom mate and it&#x27;ll do the work. Only thing I need to do is wash it after using it. No need to replace batteries every few months.    It feels very solid (not cheap) and heavy. Doesn&#x27;t feel like it will break and will probability last me a life time.    Only used it a few times, but it never plucked out my nose hair and works very well.    I would recommend it to anyone.    p.s. I haven&#x27;t tried it for ear hair trimming because I don&#x27;t have any.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband.  He has gone through battery-operated Wahl nose hair trimmers about once a year!  We bought this to try something different hoping it would have a longer life.  The metal looks a lot stronger than Wahl and because it isn&#x27;t run by battery, I don&#x27;t expect to have a power issue with it.  In order to utilize this nose hair trimmer, you just turn the knob on the bottom which turns the blade on the top.  My husband says it is even more effective and he feels it less than his previous Wahl brand.  So far so good!</li>
    <li> Always nice to find a well made and made in USA tool.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, reasonably priced after years of nightmares with other products.</li>
    <li> I have to believe that most of the positive reviews on here are FAKE -- Will this trimmer last forever? probably... it is very well built... but to stand there and twist the end of it, at effectively about 3RPMS... TRUST ME -- IT IS JUST AWFUL -- pulled hairs are common... you will DREAD using this product... do yourself a favor and pass on this foolish \\&quot;invention\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Works great easy to use fast</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know why some reviewers complained about &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;not cutting&amp;#34;.  This is very smooth, and cuts.  It is so smooth, I didn&#x27;t know if it was cutting, until I looked in the blades [and saw little cut hairs there!]</li>
    <li> Worked adequately for a few months, but started pulling instead of cutting afterward, possibly due to the blades misaligning. It&#x27;s now completely unusable. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> The Groom Mate is well made and easy to use; however it is difficult to trim all the hairs in my nose and I usually end up using a pair of scissors to finish the trimming.</li>
    <li> You need to practice to use this.  If you are in a hurry, buy electrical one.  It works and environmentally friendly though.</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the most ruggedly crafted pieces of machinery I own.  Your great-great-great-great-great-great grandson will be passing it down to their son when he gets to be a man of a certain age.  I started out using rotary, so I&#x27;m used to them.  Then I had an electric, which would CONSTANTLY tug and rip out hairs.  Most ungodly painful experience I&#x27;ve ever had to endure.  This one is like a dream... easy to clean, never rips or pulls on hair, will last a lifetime.  So for those who complain about tugging and pulling on hairs, you&#x27;re doing something wrong.</li>
    <li> Having used all kinds of power nose trimmers over the years (I&#x27;m 75) and having to frequently replace each one, the Platinum XL is the best I have ever had!! Safe and easy to use. Does a perfect job. Great product. Great customer service. Product arrived five (5) days prior to estimated delivery date. Am ordering one for each of my sons-in-law and grandsons.</li>
    <li> Works very well, no snagging or pulling. Easy to clean. Low price. Seems like it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Groom Mate XL N&amp;H Trimmer from Amazon and got it within days. The unit was quality and had a substantial feel. It included a cleaning brush. It trimmed my nose and ear hairs smoothly, with no pulling or discomfort. I should have had this unit long ago. I feel I got my money&#x27;s worth ($ 19 bucks). A must have, for personal grooming.</li>
    <li> I have used several types of trimmers and none have performed as they claim.  This trimmer works great.  It doesn&#x27;t shave, it cuts the hairs close.  No need to worry about cutting the inside of your nose.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s advertised to do, works well on nose hair, not so hot on ear hair though. I think its a good purchase and would recommend it if your looking for a non electric grooming tool for nose hair.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that would cut close and thouroughly, I have used battery types before that were less expensive, quicker and with better results. - disappointed, and hairy still..</li>
    <li> This item is well made and works very well.  It is as effective as the battery operated trimmer it replaced for nasal trimming.&lt;br /&gt;This item is well made and as effective at nasal trimming as the battery operated trimmer it replaced.  There is a technique that one needs to learn when using it for ears and I haven&#x27;t figured that out yet.  Also, there can be occasional pulling if used improperly.  This unpleasantness is easily reduced with practice.</li>
    <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t read the entire description, but after my husband complained that his last two nose hair trimmers weren&#x27;t \\&quot;cutting it\\&quot; I took matters into my own hands.  But I didn&#x27;t know that would be literal!  Unlike the other trimmers on the market, this one does not run on batteries.  Instead, you hold it with one hand and twist the base rapidly with the other, all while it&#x27;s inserted in your (or rather HIS) nostil.  Awkward at best, and completely ineffective.  I&#x27;m going to try to return it.</li>
    <li> One of the most stupendous product I have ever seen. Painful, non-functional......Buy an electric one from Panasonic for he same price and you will thank yourself.</li>
    <li> The &#x27;Platinum XL Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer&#x27; doesn&#x27;t work at all. It doesn&#x27;t even get out of the gate with a chance to succeed. It&#x27;s a self-powered trimmer in which you spin the blades back and forth inside a stationary cylinder to cut hair. The blades won&#x27;t even turn inside the cylinder. What won&#x27;t turn, won&#x27;t cut. Since it&#x27;s round, it doesn&#x27;t even work as a paper weight. Totally useless. Don&#x27;t buy it, you might as well run your money through a shredder. At least then you could use it for mulch. If you buy it anyway . . . Good Luck!</li>
    <li> It feels like a heavy expensive well made product. It&#x27;s a bit awkward to use (but I find any nose trimmer to be awkward). It comes with a lifetime warranty. Very easy to clean.    Bottomline: It works. If you&#x27;re in the market for a nose trimmer, this is the one!</li>
    <li> I was a little leary at first,but It was amazing to see the product work.If you looking for a trimmer this is the one all you need.</li>
    <li> This is a quality item and is quite heavy duty.  It works better than the last one I owned which was made by Revlon, I believe.  Effective, good quality, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Wanted to like this trimmer, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. Awkward to hold and often snags the hairs. To much pain involved for me.</li>
    <li> I have owned several nose and ear hair trimmers. The Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer is the best by far. No batteries needed and trims hair very nicely. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little groomer. It is quality constructed. The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is not battery operated. Some folks may like this fact.    You have to twist the bottom half and this turns the blades on the top. I found this a little awkward when grooming since you have to use both hands to operate.</li>
    <li> Great little device.  works great on nose and ears.  Smaller than I thought but very solid and very little and occassional pulling of a hair.  But every method does.  It is minimal.  I would not dare take it apart however.  I heard it will not be the same if taken apart but I don&#x27;t see the need.  Works great and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> First, I read a bunch of forums that accuse this company of writing reviews for themselves, so I was pretty hesitant...  But it looks like they really abide by their lifetime warranty, so I thought I&#x27;d give them a try.  I want to say this, I really (I&#x27;ve only had it for a week) love this little trimmer.  I&#x27;ve used mechanical ones in the past, but just ended up always going with the titanium sharp pointed scissors (my father is a metallurgist, so he gave me this little sharp scissors 10+ years ago and I still use them today) because the mechanical ones either break down, pull my hairs, both or just don&#x27;t work even from the beginning.  I have Asian hair, so I think somehow our hair is slightly thicker (but I could be wrong), thus I haven&#x27;t had good luck except with the scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this said, I bought this trimmer and was amazed at the weight and the material of this trimmer.  It&#x27;s small, but it&#x27;s got a GREAT weight to it (it&#x27;s heavier than it looks), which is a great thing for an item like this.  Not only does the material seem like it&#x27;s going to last, but it also proves to be incredibly effective BECAUSE of the quality material that was used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be exercising the lifetime warranty if this does break down in the future, but it seems unlikely due to its strong build.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My opinion...  This is a MUST buy.</li>
    <li> This little gadget is phenomenal. I used to go with the safety scissor method and it never got less-than nerve-wracking. I didn&#x27;t want something that needed batteries because eventually, zombies... no power, no batteries. This thing has no batteries and it keeps my itchy hairs at bay!</li>
    <li> Its simple, its reliable, it requires no power (ideal for travelling)  Only possible issue is it cuts and doesnt pluch hair so when hair grows back its from its widest point (as opposed to a new hair with a narrow softer tip)So its a more prickly hair than a plucked one. But this great little gadget means u can simply and quickly just trim again.</li>
    <li> Not recommended. The problem this trimmer is it&#x27;s difficult to keep steady when having to turn the bottom, which drastically effects accuracy. The cutting efficiency is also questionable at best. I went back to using scissors and a small flashlight. It looks cool, though!</li>
    <li> This was a christmas present and it arrived right on time and wrapped nice. He loved it. I have no idea how it works, but Im sure it will be fine</li>
    <li> When I first opened this, I thought it was a well made but non functioning waste of money, but as I practiced using it for a few minutes, it started to actually work pretty well. Now I can get it to do as good a job as the electric Panasonic even though it takes a little longer. But, not having to worry about batteries is great.    I have owned 7 or 8 brands of these, and this and the Panasonic are the only ones I&#x27;ve ever found that actually work.[[ASIN:B000O5VKK0 Panasonic ER415SC Nose and Ear Trimmer, Silver]]</li>
    <li> Design is unusual. Because the opening where the hair must enter for the blade to get to it is on the side of the cylinder, it can be a little difficult to aim where you&#x27;re going with this - it&#x27;s like, just put it in there, turn and hope it works - which it does work, so I can&#x27;t complain too much really. One thing though, the distance between the outer rim and the inner blade is such that it can be difficult to get a relatively short hair that may be near the front that is visible, if not too long.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I use this product. It is far better that any electric clipper we have ever had and best of all there is no battery to go dead just when you want to use it. Great product, great price.</li>
    <li> It works well, as advertised.  The only catch is it isn&#x27;t battery powered.  So you have to manually turn it to get it to work.</li>
    <li> Works very well, however I do get a snag (pinch or pulled hair) from time to time.  I switch from using this and Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/Dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer  battery powered once which also seems to do an excellent job.</li>
    <li> Hurts and yanks out hair like others have said.</li>
    <li> I rarely write product reviews, but I have to say this is probably the best purchase I have ever made. Ever!  I have had more than a half dozen electric nose hair trimmers in my lifetime. Each of them claiming to be painless.  None were.  I was hesitant to get the groom mate xl, but for the price (and all the great reviews) I just couldn&#x27;t resist anymore.  Well, I am glad I got it.  When I use it, I truly can&#x27;t even tell that it is cutting the nose hairs.  The first time, I actually had to take it out of my nose and look at it to see that it was trimming the hairs!  Amazing, no pulling or pain!  And a really great, thorough job.    Now I don&#x27;t avoid nose hair trimming. Before, I might go a bit too long and my nose hairs \\&quot;might\\&quot;, \\&quot;possibly\\&quot; get unsightly (according to my wife). :)  Just plain amazing.    I don&#x27;t need to trim my ears, so I can&#x27;t comment on that; I imagine that might be a bit awkward with the two hand action, but trimming nose hairs is easy and painless.  The product more than lives up to its claims; you don&#x27;t find that much these days.</li>
    <li> Avoid this item, it doesn&#x27;t trim nose hair, it just yanks them out. Sure, it is beautiful and appears to be well made, but it grabs hair and pulls them out. OUCH!</li>
    <li> I think this nose trimmer is probably as effective and smooth as any, if not more so, just based on what other reviews have said.  I too carefully considered the reviews on the various models before deciding on this one since most of the electric options hover around the 3 star mark at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out as soon as I recieved the item.  I followed the directions and it trims very well.  Only when you hold it too close or up against the inside of your nose did I find it to pull.  If you hold it centered or there about, it cuts nicely and very smoothly without pulling at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little ackward to hold and twist while you have it in your nose or ear; but it&#x27;s very workable.  It&#x27;s just not electric...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real drawback, aside from probably not being as quick as an electric trimmer, is that it is near impossible to trim the outside of your ear on the flatter surfaces.  Obviously, this item is intended to be inserted into your nasal cavity or your outer ear canal.  And for that, I think it works nearly perfect for the most part.  There is still probably good reason to keep a beard trimmer on hand; but this does work very well for the inside of the ol&#x27; nose and ear.</li>
    <li> Practice first, and you will be more successful with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold top portion with thumb and fore finger of one hand, and the bottom portion with thumb and forefinger of other hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep top hand still and rotate the bottom half rapidly to one direction and then the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, place the device near the hair you want to cut, hold the top part still in relation to the twisting bottom part and move the tip around to get the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts ear hair and nose hair that is stiff and of almost any length, it does not work so well on fluffy hair that is short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these things and have three just in case I get the urge there is always one nearby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pulling nose hair can cause dangerous infections in your nose that can move to your brain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used two other battery operated ones and they are both junk.</li>
    <li> The trimmer (Groom Mate Platinum XL) is effective, durable and so small that it easily fits in the elastic loops of many small grooming kits.  I was thinking of ordering the other one that is similar from the same vendor, but with a scissor action.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t this one stores in places the other one would probably not.  I had noted some reviews that indicated it pulled hairs rather than cutting them.  After using it several times, I think this was a problem with the user not holding it still with one hand and rotating the cutter blades with the other.  It worked fine for me.  The vendor got the product to me in about 2 days from the time of order!!!  Great transaction, would use them again!</li>
    <li> I am giving the Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose and Ear hair trimmer a 4 star rating. I have had many Electric Nose and Ear hair trimmers but usualy they do not last long because they either break or the battries go dead at just the time that you really need to use it. Well with the Groom Mate those worries are over you never need batteries it never needs new blades so this is a winner in my book. Thanks GROOM MATE.</li>
    <li> This was my first nose and ear trimmer and I was pleasantly surprised at how well this thing works. While, yes it will rip out the hairs if your not careful I found that it did trim the hairs quite efficiently.    I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good trimmer.</li>
    <li> Pretty much just yanks the hair out of my nose rather than cutting them nicely like I thought it would.  A pair of scissors would be much more useful.</li>
    <li> I initially gave this a 5 star rating. I was very happy with it at first but the longer I used it the less effective it became. It finally was just pulling out a few nose hairs and ignoring most of them. I think it dulls over time. I recently got a Remington nose hair trimmer from Amazon to replace this. The Remington has a little snout on the end that fits perfectly into nose and ear crevices and turns and trims effortlessly. I can no longer recommend the Platinum XL.</li>
    <li> It works like a charm</li>
    <li> September 23, 2009:&lt;br /&gt;When I use this thing, there is no doubt that it&#x27;s doing the job.  It&#x27;s heavy, spins nice and smooth and doesn&#x27;t pull or pinch.  What more can you ask?  It&#x27;s powered by hand so there&#x27;s no batteries to run down and put off replacing, no chargers or wires.  Just a small device that does exactly what it&#x27;s made for and does it well.  I may never need to buy another one of these things again but if I do, it will be the Groom Mate Platinum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January 15th, 2013:&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer STILL WORKS AMAZING.  I dropped in once and had to carefully bend one of the tines out of the way of the blade but considering I use this often and that I keep it in my shower where it gets wet constantly... I am amazed.  I&#x27;ve seen \\&quot;stainless steel\\&quot; rust before but this thing has no speck of rust and cuts almost as good as it did on the first day.  3 and a half years of use? Awesome.</li>
    <li> Amazon should clearly say that this product will not run in electric. I tried it, but it&#x27;s not that great, if you have a lot of hair in the nose you have to use this tool at least 3 times to get a clean cut. Cleaning is not that easy, You need at least a mini brush to clean the hair from this tool</li>
    <li> I am a 48 year old woman who has......GASP!.......developed tufts of unsightly gray nasal hair. If you&#x27;re thinking, \\&quot;Ewwww!\\&quot; just imagine how I felt before finding this wonderful device. What can I say? It works, it&#x27;s easy to use and it has stopped me from turning into a man.    That&#x27;s great but what else can it do?     I realized as I was trimming my nasal hair the other day that by using this hand-operated trimmer I have reduced my carbon nose print! Hey, we all have to start somewhere!     I highly recommend this trimmer. It&#x27;s a quality product that does exactly what the manufacturer claims that it will do. I gave it just 4 stars because despite how well it works I believe the price is somewhat high considering what a simple device this is.</li>
    <li> Have tried many nose trimmers &amp; this is the best. The battery powered ones really don&#x27;t work very well. Arrived promptly &amp; as advertised.</li>
    <li> All most all personal hair grooming products, in general, are okay at best. In my search to find a product that works well...I ended up with this one...totally misled by the reviews!    This product is   manually operated  hard to use  doesn&#x27;t do good job at all    Anybody who has used a personal hair grooming product before will know that you need to have the ability to maneuver the product inside of your nose or ear and almost always have one of your hands on the nose or the ear to help out...this product does not satisfy the basic scenario.</li>
    <li> took a long time before all the nose-hairs were removed. painful at times. but i guess it&#x27;s okay for the price since it&#x27;s durable and requires very low maintenance.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of nose hair, but this product did a nice job. One must develop a technique. I use the the thumb and fore finger of both hands and rotate the barrels in opposite directions. Works fine. Small and easy to use and clean. They say only place in nose 1/8 of and inch. I find 1/2 inch is better</li>
    <li> I have to agree with all the positive reviews on Amazon.com! This trimmer is everything I was looking and hoping for in a nose hair trimmer!     Cuts perfectly and painlessly. Better then any battery operated trimmer I have ever used. And to think I will never have to buy batteries for something like this again is just icing on the cake!    Great product and would buy again if I needed to.     I also bought the TrimIt Wing version. Also excellent. But for whatever reason, I actually like the two handed one more. I think its because it feels like more of a high end product. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the TrimIt Wing (one handed version) is extremely well made, but the Platinum XL feels even more so.    You will also be amazed on how easy and natural it becomes to use your hands with the Platinum XL then with a battery operated device.     Just get one!</li>
    <li> it is very small so you can carry it in every pocket you want, it´s not a electrical nose and hair trimmer so it´s more difficult to find those little hair you want to remove, all you have  to do it turn it and turn until you cut the hair</li>
    <li> I have an electric nose hair trimmer[$12.00] and noticed that is wasn&#x27;t cutting hair like it advertised. So when I was on Amazon, I decided to see if there were any nose hair trimmers. I came across a couple, but the Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer seemed to have very good reviews.    Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I opened the box to try out the trimmer. Well, what a great nose hair cut! I was surprised to not find any nose hairs anywhere close to \\&quot;peeking\\&quot; from my nose. It&#x27;s also made in the U.S. I use it every week. I&#x27;m getting this for my girlfriend!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband after reading several reviews about the product.  I too was thinking strickly battery trimmer.  However, I decided to go with what many of the reviews said about it being the best they had ever tried.  My husband always complained that trimmers pull and are painful to use.  So many men had said not true with this trimmer.  My husband agrees!  He said it works great with no pinching or pulling.  Thanks for having reviews! I never would have bought this product before reading them.  My husband says it&#x27;s the best he has ever used!</li>
    <li> At first I was pleased with this trimmer. After a month or two it began to pull my nose hairs out instead of cutting them off.  I checked into getting my money back but the only thing they offer is a free replacement.  It went into the garbage can.      The manufacturer responded to my review and went above and beyond by replacing my trimmer and refunding my money.  This indicates the company will stand behind their product.  Would I deal with this company again?  Yes, definitely!</li>
    <li> There must be something wrong with me; I simply could not get this device to work.  I&#x27;m not a stupid man; I tried every possible twist and angle and rotation speed and pressure adjustment that I could think of - every combination - and I simply could not get it to work as well as every battery-powered nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I give it three stars for craftsmanship ... it&#x27;s very well-built and designed ... but for functionality, I can&#x27;t recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> I used the Panasonic ER411 for several years before the blades started hitting the top blade enclosure causing a loud clanky noise, so I had to find a new trimmer.  I searched amazon.com for reviews of nose hair trimmers, and this product had by far the best and most reviews.  I was suspicious that this was not a battery-powered trimmer like the Panasonic one that I loved (but that model was no longer made).  But, since I live 55 miles (one way) from the nearest store that sells trimmers, bec. I didn&#x27;t want to make a special trip JUST for a nose hair trimmer, bec. I REALLY needed to trim my nose hairs, and because this product had a lifetime guarantee, so if I didn&#x27;t like it, I could send it back and get a full refund, and bec. with 491 reviews at the time of my purchase, with a breakdown as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;491 Reviews&lt;br /&gt;5 star:  (331)&lt;br /&gt;4 star:  (61)&lt;br /&gt;3 star:  (29)&lt;br /&gt;2 star:  (31)&lt;br /&gt;1 star:  (39)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy the Groom Mate Platinum XL and try it out for myself.  To its credit, it arrived within 3 days of my ordering.  I was very excited to test it.  The compact and durable/solid/sturdy design is impressive and ingenious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, I didn&#x27;t like the Platinum XL nose hair trimmer and am returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. When I used it, I had painful tugs and yanks of my nose hair, something I didn&#x27;t have when I used the battery-powered Panasonic ER411.  Not all the hairs had painful tugs and yanks, but many more than the Panasonic.  My guess is that the speed at which a battery-powered trimmer&#x27;s blades spin and cut is MUCH FASTER than the speed at which a human using two hands can twist the Platinum XL.  The slower speed makes the device tug and yank, causing pain.  It&#x27;s analogous to taking a Band-Aid off your skin: if you pull it off fast/quickly, the pain is over quickly; however, it you pull it off slowly, the pain is more severe.  It was very rare for me to have any pain, tugs, or yanks with my Panasonic ER411.  I do note that several commenters said their battery-operated trimmer tugged and yanked, but their XL did not.  I envy their experience with the XL; it just isn&#x27;t my experience.  I&#x27;m wondering if the fact that I always used brand new, fully juiced (not old) batteries when I use my Panasonic trimmer helped me have pain-free and tug/yank-free trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The XL does NOT cut the very base of the hair&#x27;s shaft; it leaves several millimeters of nose hair there, hair that my Panasonic trimmed, almost right down to the skin.  When I trim my nose hair, I want it done right and completely.  I don&#x27;t want semi-long hair left in my nose, which makes me have to trim yet again in a week or 2.  With my Panasonic, I was able to trim once every 4 weeks, about as often as I cut my head hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s slow and time-consuming.  With the battery-powered trimmer, trimming my nose hairs took 3 minutes max, and I really pushed it deep into my nostrils to get the hairs hiding in the back.  With the XL, it is SO SLOW.  It takes forever to just do one nostril, and it does that with more painful tugs and yanks than the Panasonic did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. You have to use 2 hands to operate the XL.  With my Panasonic, I liked the freedom of one-handed use, so I could use my other hand/fingers to bend or lift my nose in a way to allow the trimmer to better reach and trim areas it couldn&#x27;t without the bending/lifting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a complainer or a perfectionist, and I feel badly writing this review (especially since I&#x27;m so outnumbered by folks who wrote positive reviews), but it is the truth as I experienced it.  I don&#x27;t have an alternate/substitute trimmer yet, as again, it&#x27;s a long drive to the store for me, but I&#x27;m gonna have to get a battery-powered one, possibly another Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/20/10 update: Groom Mate has promptly and without hassle refunded my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/10/10 update: I have purchased and am VERY HAPPY with the WAHL Ear, Nose, and Brow Wet/Dry Battery Trimmer, Model 41559-300N that I purchased at Bed, Bath, and Beyond for $19.99.  I have used it once, and although it took a little more time to cut the nose hairs than my trusty Panasonic ER411 did, it cut down to the base of the hair like I wanted/left just a tiny stub behind and did not painfully tug or yank any of my hairs.  I have used it only once, but I am very happy with it and highly recommend it.  The packaging indicates the product has a generous 30-day money back guarantee and a 3-year limited warranty.have used it once, and although it took a little more time to cut the nose hairs than my trusty Panasonic ER411 did, it cut down to the base of the hair like I wanted/left just a tiny stub behind and did not painfully tug or yank any of my hairs.

    <li> Having read a bunch of other reviews, I thought that this product may be the \\&quot;wet shave\\&quot; of nose trims.  Meaning that I was hoping it would be more comfortable, closer and a cleaner cut.  Personally I didn&#x27;t find it to be any better then my Panasonic electric trimmer.  I couldn&#x27;t get it to cut as close and it did take longer.  That said, it is a very well engineered tool and will be great as a light weight travel trimmer.  For me, I&#x27;ll probably just continue to use the electric at home.</li>
    <li> This is a well-engineered product. The design is excellent for nose hair trimming. Ear hair...not so much. This little trimmer is much better than the battery-powered ones I have used.</li>
    <li> Ok, after all the hype and controversy (see discussion board on this product) about fake 5-five star reviews being put up by either this company, its employees or a marketing firm, it seems that the product can stand on its own merits without the phony one-shot reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is solidly made from metal and is about the size of a short pencil but a little bit broader. The device works by inserting the cutting mechanism into your nostril or ear and then rotating the knurled barrel clockwise and counter clockwise. After the first use it was amazing how thorough a job it did with unsightly nose hair. Since the device is made entirely out of stainless steel, a quick rinse under the faucet and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why this device doesn&#x27;t get a perfect five is based upon two things. Although the ad \\&quot;guarantees\\&quot; that the device will not pinch or pull, it does occasionally. But after some time with it, it is really due to user error more than anything else. The way to use this properly is to make sure your hand is absolutely still while you are using the device. If you are rotating the barrel while you are moving it or withdrawing it, you&#x27;ll have a hair or two snag on the cutter. This can be entirely avoided if you are careful about using this trimmer on a section at a time. The instructions could have pointed this out to save you some infrequent painful experiences but it omits this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second reason why this product doesn&#x27;t get a perfect score is due to the fake and phony reviews about this product. The reviews are usually very short (and glowing) but if you click on the authors, you&#x27;ll see that a good many of them are only one-shot reviews or are among a series of three or four hastily written reviews all occurring on the same day... apparently bogus reviews put up to inflate the ranking of this product. No seller should ever get a perfect rating when they attempt to boost their own amazon ranking by writing phony reviews. Although amazon customers have pointed out these bogus reviews regarding this device, the owner of the company merely replies by accusing the negative reviews of his product as being false...he never denies the fact that many of the five-star reviews are indeed fabricated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you overlook the bogus review issue and take your time when you use this product, you&#x27;ll know that it is a good one for the purpose it serves.h amazon customers have pointed out these bogus reviews regarding this device, the owner of the company merely replies by accusing the negative reviews of his product as being false...he never denies the fact that many of the five-star reviews are indeed fabricated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you overlook the bogus review issue and take your time when you use this product, you&#x27;ll know that it is a good one for the purpose it serves.</li>
    <li> The trimmer looks good, is made in a quality manner, and works fine.  So far I love it and would recommend it over electrical models.</li>
    <li> First of all, it is a very well built trimmer - not a flimsy plastic built stuff which you would use for a few years.  Will surely last a lifetime.    I was curious if this would really work - looked at all the reviews and none of them seemed to be fake - written by good reviewers.       When I started using it for myself - I could not believe that it really worked very well - a few twists in your nose - no twitching or pulling of nasal hair.   It does take maybe a few more seconds more than a electrical nasal trimmer - but does the job very well.    Eco friendly since there are not batteries to remove.    Good for nasal, ok for ear hair.  For nasal hair trimming - I would rate it 5/5 and for ears - I would rate it 3/5.    The company&#x27;s customer service is awesome - they will answer to your every query.</li>
    <li> The trimmeer arrived on time and in good order.  I find it very difficult to use because of the very slim openings for the hairs to get inro the trim area.--</li>
    <li> Are these positive reviews for real? I don&#x27;t see how anybody can like this thing, stiff to turn, doesn&#x27;t cut well at all.  With my electric trimmer I&#x27;m done in a couple minutes max with almost zero effort.  With this thing I&#x27;m going for 10 minutes and feel like I&#x27;m going to get nerve damage from torquing my wrists over and over and over again, to seemingly no effect.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. Great quality product.</li>
    <li> Its been saving me the pain of trimming my nose hairs by scissors,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people say that it pulls on the hairs, causing pain. I&#x27;ve found out what makes it pull:&lt;br /&gt;Keep the bottom part spinning at all times, most incidences of pulling are caused when it clamps down on, but doesnt fully cut the hair, and the user stops spinning the blade. The weight of the trimmer then pulls down, causing pain, if you keep it spinning at all when entering and exiting your nostril, it wont pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, STORE it in the plastic tube it comes with! I tossed mine a few months after I got it. A business trip later, and a trip in my luggage, and one of the tips bent. This causes unsmooth turning, and can also result in pulling hairs. I bought another one and keep it in the plastic container now, no damage, no hair pulling</li>
    <li> Built to last, but I&#x27;m sorry to say that if fails to do the job well in my nostrils.  Build quality is great, but if it doesn&#x27;t the job it was intended for, that&#x27;s largely irrelevant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I DO have a lot of nose hair, but this tool is simply not up to the task of grooming same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only surmise the ratings are based upon less hirsute reviewers, people confusing form with function, or some collective hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this to anyone who needs to groom their hirsute nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YMMV.</li>
    <li> This is much smaller in person than I expected.  It&#x27;s only about the size of my pinkie, very small and slim.  That being said, it works great.  My husband wanted an electric one, but I found this and thought it was a great way to save come energy and support a \\&quot;made in the USA\\&quot; product, so I bought it despite his reservations about using a manual clipper.  It&#x27;s very easy to hold, although if you had arthritis or mobility issues with your hands, you may find it difficult.  No pulling hairs and it seems to keep him neat and tidy.</li>
    <li> Great product per its portability and esp. no battery needed which is very good item for travel or survival situation!</li>
    <li> it isn&#x27;t.  It actually does a great job, sort of.  When I can keep the tip aimed where I need it to be it cuts without a problem most of the hairs I&#x27;m going for.  When I can keep it aimed where I want.  This is difficult to do because of the two handed operation which is absolutely necessary to use this product.  one hand holds the top half and the other hand twists the bottom.  I actually find it works better, though less accurately, when I twist with both hands (opposite directions of course)...     Due to this problem with aiming inaccuracy I give this one a 3 star.  It shows great promise though and I&#x27;m about to buy their single handed model.  If it does what I think it should it could change the face of my unsightly nose hairs forever.</li>
    <li> After using electric trimmers for years I was skeptical about a hand powered trimmer, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the Platinum XL works great and it&#x27;s built to last. No pulled hairs and no need to recharge, this ones a keeper! The company ships fast because I received it in two business days.</li>
    <li> Just try and spot a hair in my nostrels!</li>
    <li> Wonderful Product! As Good as Advertised</li>
    <li> So far I tried many thpes of Nose Hair Trimmer. Some works by battery. But this item do not need any battery. Even though this item is No. 1 capability.</li>
    <li> I suppose that in exotic \\&quot;nose-hair\\&quot; trimmer industry having the mantra of \\&quot;stay focused and do it well\\&quot; is a good business strategy for anyone, but this could be the single best customer service experience I&#x27;ve ever had.  Mine arrived and was hard to turn, it seems one of the tines must of got bent.  I requested a return and they contacted me offered a refund and to send me a replacement which arrived two days later.  I&#x27;m glad I took them up on it, the new one works perfectly and like most of the reviews here it works well.  It is a well made product, I think my situation must of been a fluke and it is getting very rare these days to see the kind of service these folks maintain behind their product.  Never thought I&#x27;d be so happy about a product that reduces the number of boogers in my nose.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to. Very sturdy product, extremely well made. Definitely worth the money if you have long nostril hair that you want to remove.</li>
    <li> Removes hair.  After using I asked my girlfriend how does my nose hair problem look her reply...\\&quot;what nose hair\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great, trims quickly and easily without the \\&quot;weed wacker\\&quot; noise, heat or smell from the cheap battery trimmers.  Haven&#x27;t had any problems at all.</li>
    <li> I use it to gently trim hair from my nose.&lt;br /&gt;It works very well.&lt;br /&gt;The product should last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;When I accidentally got two instead if the one I ordered. They were very professional and credited my account&lt;br /&gt;5 of 5 stars</li>
    <li> This trimmer works well and there is no sign of corrosion after a year of use and being left in an often steamy bathroom.</li>
    <li> SMALL COMPACT ITEM, HARD TO CUT EARS HAIR WHEN YOU HAVE TO USE BOTH HANDS TO HANDLE</li>
    <li> Looks good. Cumbersom to use. You have to rotate with one hand and hold in position with the other hand. Some times you can feel hair pulling and painful. Better avoid this product</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a trimmer similar in design to the Groom Mate many years ago (25+). I dropped it and it no longer worked (probable bent the cutting end).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a Panasonic ER409 battery-operated trimmer. It worked fine. I got a reasonable amount of use out of it. Then a part of the plastic that helps secure the removable cutter in place broke; I don&#x27;t remember, but I probably dropped this one too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using a battery-powered Philips Norelco NT9110. It is a very nice device but, for me, it is not good for the nose. I does an excellent job otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very glad to have found the Groom Mate Platinum XL Plus - Nose Hair Trimmer -w/Leather Pouch &amp; Brush - Lifetime Warranty - Made in the USA. It is excellent for the nose. It comes with a very nice protective leather pouch. Now all I have to do is remember not to drop it when it is out of the pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXCELLENT SELLER:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made a mistake in placing my order: I had intended to order the Groom Mate Platinum XL Plus - Nose Hair Trimmer -w/Leather Pouch &amp; Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted the Pouch to protect the Groom Mate so I requested a return authorization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Groom Mate informed me they would send me the pouch with an extra cleaning brush at no charge. I told them I would be more than happy to pay the difference in the items&#x27; prices plus postage. The said there would be no charge and send me the pouch and brush by 1st class mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that&#x27;s what I call Friendly Customer Service.</li>
    <li> I owned a miniature Panasonic battery run trimmer that always needed a little help getting started - I had to tap it all the time to get it going, until it finally died. I really didn&#x27;t like it much from day one because every time I used it, it tickled my nostrils. It got old really quick! After finding the Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose Hair Trimmer on Amazon, I decided to try it. I got it in three days - FREE SHIPPING - and am very pleased with it&#x27;s performance. I look forward to many years of continued efficient, hassel-free use. The best part of it all. . . No more battery replacements and NO MORE TICKLED NOSTRILS &#x3D;O) I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This item works great! And easy!</li>
    <li> I recently received the groom mate and I am very satisfied with this precision made item . It works extremely well, so well that I plan to order at least six more and give them as Christmas gifts .</li>
    <li> I purchased this trimmer for my husband and this is his review.  After three or four times of use I was ready to send it back.  After three months of use its the best trimmer i have ever had.  This trimmer takes training in order to use properly.  Buy It!!!</li>
    <li> This does trim nose hair.  However, as many other users reported, it leaves the hairs too long.  I prefer the electric style nose hair trimmers which trim much closer.</li>
    <li> I have no doubt this thing will last me my entire life. Not sure anyone can say that about an electric one. I take comfort in knowing that I will never ever have to buy another one. Also, it is very small and easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> Neat little tool but not the best trimmer. It leaves many untrimmed hairs that tickle. Doesn&#x27;t fit in my ears.   It is well built and I like that it doesn&#x27;t require batteries, simple and easy for travel. takes a little time to get used to and use correctly.</li>
    <li> I had been using the panasonic electric for years then replaced it and the newer model has been pretty weak - it isn&#x27;t nearly as close of a shave.  So I read the reviews of the groom mate and went for it. I must admit, the trim is the closest I&#x27;ve had.  I don&#x27;t mind it being manual.  It&#x27;s so close I don&#x27;t need to trim again for nearly a month.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This seems more like a torture device than anything else. It is largely ineffectual and when a nose hair does get in the blades, the device half cuts and half pulls the hair out.  I have tried this several times varying my technique with the same results. I wish I could get my money back. Don&#x27;t buy it unless you are a sucker for pain.</li>
    <li> This is a solid product that will definately last a lifetime. It does a great job trimming nose and ear hair. No expensive batteries needed. It&#x27;s all hand operated. Best of all, its made in the USA!</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings on this.  I purchased this over 6 months ago and have been using it since.  Yes it&#x27;s not pleasant that some of us have this hair that needs to be trimmed in places we wish we didn&#x27;t have it.  I read reviews on this product referring to it as a torture device for the way it pulls hair.  I have had some of those eye watering experiences with it.  I have also had it trim a lot of hair well.  I have used this in combination with a small pair of scissors and had good success.  If you&#x27;re looking for the best of the best I can&#x27;t honestly say this is it.  I am hoping that it lasts the next 20 years because it is a quality built item of all steel.  I&#x27;m not sure what could possibly fail on it other than perhaps growing dull.</li>
    <li> Choose this rating because the product was not what I expected. I sent the product back for a refund. Will keep looking for another brand.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical that something like this could work well, but I am very glad I bought this.  Very simple, very very well made.  Works very well.</li>
    <li> Ok, I have had many nose trimmers in the past. When my last one gave out, I did alot of research on the internet before buying a replacement. I decided to give this one a try based on the reviews many websites, including Amazon, gave it. I especially liked the fact that its made in USA. The unit does indeed look well-built. Its all metal! It will last you a lifetime, no doubt about that. The problems is, it really does not work as you might think it will. First, its very difficult to manauver it. It is quite awkward since you have to use both hands and make the just the right amount of twists and turns just to get to the hair. When you finally manage to cut hair, you will notice that it simply doesnt cut it close enough. That is a big problem for me because I had better results with my Panasonic nose hair trimmer that was much easier to use too. The whole point of a hair trimmer is to cut hair to where its not noticable! Im sure other electric trimmers will give you better results as well. Also, you need a screw driver just to open it up to clean it! It has grease on the blades, so all the hairs get stuck to it. You have to wipe off the grease and apply more (if you have any). Please, dont buy into the hype of if being \\&quot;Made in USA\\&quot;. Those words simply dont mean anything anymore. Do yourself a favor and buy any of the Panasonic ones.</li>
    <li> I thought the size, which fits in the palm of your hand, would be one of the many things I would enjoy about this product, but that&#x27;s the only thing I like about this product.  I didn&#x27;t like it at all.  It hurts!!  It feels like you&#x27;re ripping nose hairs and skin out of your nostrils which is a very delicate area to begin with.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have owned this nose-hair trimmer for about two months now.  It does a great job and is WAY more reliable than any powered trimmer that I have ever owned.  The blades are nice and sharp but are far enough from your skin that there is very little risk of them coming in to contact with you.  The only minor quibble I have with the design is that it is tough to clean out.  A brush is included and it does a pretty good job, but because the thing is so small it is hard to get every hair out of the blade area.  Also, after having read the one-star review on here I cross my toes every time I stick this up my nose.  That said, I have NO complaints on my end.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done.  Hurts a pinch for some hairs, but efficiently serves the function and heavy duty, quality product.  You will be impressed with how solid this thing is.</li>
    <li> No batteries, no buzzing, no pinching or pulling, and no falling apart if you drop it (like my last two battery-powered trimmers)! In short, it does exactly what it&#x27;s intended to do and will probably last forever.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is much better then any type I have ever used including electric, scissors and other manual types. Great delivery time also</li>
    <li> This is a really good product! It did take a couple times to get the hang of it, but once I did I could get a pretty close cut without pinching skin. The quality is simply exemplary! I wish more companies would make quality grooming tools like this! Buy it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am 55 years old and have had to buy a nose trimmer about every 2 years.    I read reviews on this one and decided to take a chance.    When I took it out of the box I was amazed at the rugged construction.  I do believe that I could throw it down on a sidewalk without damaging it.  Heavy stainless steel contruction.  Rugged thick very sharp blades.  No batteries.  You hold it with one hand and turn the base of it which turns the blades to cut hair.  Takes about 1/2 the time to cut hair as with the battery kind.    Judging by the construction it must be made in America or Germany.</li>
    <li> I and my husband are very satisfied with this parches. We have been looking for a nose trimmer for long time and finally we found a great trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this trimmer is a great gift for a man. I am going to buy it for my fatherhe next time. He has an electric nose hair trimmer right now but it needs to be charged regularly. This trimmer is no battery required at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a handy and easy to clean up with water. My husband has been using it for 3 years now and it is still good condition. Also, this is his essential item to take on vacation too.</li>
    <li> It is awful! I can&#x27;t believe people like this thing....first off you have to \\&quot;twist\\&quot; and hope it pulls out the hair! YUCK and OUCH!    The delivery and purchase was fine....that product not so good at all!</li>
    <li> Over the years, I bought many battery operated ones, and they hardly did any cutting.   Either the battery operated ones, mostly made in China junk, were worthless as every one of them either pulled hair, left much uncut, lost their sharpness, did not last long. I ended throwing every one of them away.  But this Platinum XL nose and ear trimmer that I bought a year ago has worked wonders for me.  I am so pleased with this made in USA product, that I am recommending to my friends.  It is still sharp, does not pull hair.  It is so easy to use, rinsable in water.  What is remarkable is that it does not need any batteries, thank goodness for Mother Earth.  I am confident of its lasting for years.  It does say lifetime guarantee.</li>
    <li> I recently received this here nose n ear hair trimmer.  It is awesome!!  Does not pull or pinch or hurt at all.  It works fast, easily, and effeciently.  It even looks all cool and futuristic.  I mos def recommend this product for anyone needing to trim the ole nose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Tightwork Groom Mate!!</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, and product was exactly as advertised. A great stocking stuffer gift. Works much better than battery operated and eliminates cuts and sores in your nose.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s plenty of reviews going on about the pros and cons...Simply from my point of view I was skeptical considering I had to manually twist to cut. However, it worked just fine with little to no pulling on my nostril hair!  Excellent buy people.     The only people who MIGHT not like this product are people with big hand\fingers or hand problems. Other then that this is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Great and easy to use product and shipping was good too. Built to last.</li>
    <li> Have gone through a number of the cheaply built battery trimmers and finally have found one that will last a long time. Easy to take apart and clean. Takes a little getting used to but once done, does a great job.</li>
    <li> This clipper keeps me looking clean and neat. It is also a much safer way to trim your nose hair than using scissors</li>
    <li> NO BATTERIES...and works VERY GOOD. Highly recommended. Many on the market, but there is no comparison to how well this one works.</li>
    <li> Great little reliable personal trimmer.  All mechanical, no batteries to worry about.  Small, portable, well made.  Would recommend this to anyone who needs a personal trimmer.</li>
    <li> If you spin it fast enough it does not pull your hair. SS, so will stay nice forever. Well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> When I read the reviews of this item, I decided I would try it. It lived up to all of my expectations and more. Very good quality. When I first used it, I was concerned it was not doing the job because I could not feel any cutting going on. I was very pleased to see it was not only doing the job, but doing it with no pulling or pinching at all. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The seller was prompt to send this device out and it trims nose hair with some work, but I will buy a motorized unit for my next purchase to save time and get the job done. I guess my fingers aren&#x27;t fast enough to spin this thing properly. I suppose it would be a good addition to the travel bag (for short trips).</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decided to pass on the battery models and get this one. I can tell you I&#x27;ll never need to buy another to replace this one since it is so well made my kids kids kids could still be using it as long as they don&#x27;t lose it. The trick to it not pulling a hair is to only move it in or out or around while slowly turning the cutter so it cuts and does not pull. If you do not have the ability to not shake then pass up on this and get the battery models with constant turning blades. This one is simple and effective on nose hair, I have no need or desire to try it anywhere else. Works perfectly and easily, just move it only while turning the cutter.</li>
    <li> It does OK.  If you twist all the way around, it doesn&#x27;t pull hairs that often, and it certainly does trim some hairs.  But, unlike other solutions, it feels like it cuts roughly half of the hairs available, and leaves a fair bit of length.  It&#x27;s an improvement over no trimming, and I do like that it&#x27;s low maintenance, compact, and battery free, but if you&#x27;re used to other methods, this may feel like a step down.</li>
    <li> Works great. It takes a few trials before you begin to see how to cut your own nose hairs. Don&#x27;t expect a 100% the first couple times. After using it for a while now, I think the device works great!</li>
    <li> I have used a mechanical trimmer, Panasonic battery operated trimmer, and scissors.  Needless to say I have never been completely satisfied with the performance of the different methods.  My new Groom Mate arrived today.  I took it out of the packaging and used it.  Within a matter of a two or three minutes my nose hairs were gone.  I suspect the time to groom my nose in the future will be less since I was getting the hang of using this product.  Excellent product....I could not be more satisfied!  I highly recommend this product for nose and ear hair removal.</li>
    <li> First off, I should have probably read more about this product before purchasing it because I didn&#x27;t know that it wasn&#x27;t electric. You have to manually twist it for it to cut your nose hairs. The cut wasn&#x27;t as close as I got with an electric nose hair trimmer I used to own and it had a hard time getting the nose hairs in the front of my nostril. It would also pull on the hairs on occassion. It will probably last forever because it is mechanical and stainless steel, but I am returning it and buying an electric one. I&#x27;d rather buy an electric one every couple of years than use this one everytime.</li>
    <li> It does a good job, and I don&#x27;t need batteries. I like it.</li>
    <li> I just want to echo how great this product is:    1. It&#x27;s simple and comfortable to use  2. It&#x27;s very simple.  3. Lifetime warranty  4. It&#x27;s not made of cheap foreign plastic and it does not require batteries.  5. It&#x27;s made in the USA.      I wish I would have found this product years ago instead of spending money on those electric ones that fizzle out after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> This may work well for some. But, I will need to revert to electric. Found this manual approach cumbersome. Unable to use the product.</li>
    <li> Indeed, manually wind the trimming blades at your own speed; ear and nose hair are gone.  I&#x27;m buying another for my hairy son.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose &amp; Ear Trimmer for my husband.  Although he liked how it looked and said it was made well, it did not perform well as a nose trimmer (pulled his nose hairs considerably and caused much pain) and after trying it several times, he just &#x27;gave up&#x27; and threw it away.  I purchased a battery-operated Panasonic nose trimmer to replace it and he likes it much better.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this item.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews about this product and thought it sounded like a good product. Once I got the product - It was made very well - it took me a few minutes to figure out how it worked.  It works ok for the nose as long as your Nose hairs are long enough. I tried to use this on my ears and it was useless and it even pulled some hairs ouch.... I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product - maybe someday someone will come out with a good nose and ear hair trimmer. Good luck on your search.</li>
    <li> Just as it was advertised. I am glad I purchased this.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, no batteries required, easy to clean, cheaper than competition, no nicks ever.  Buy it.</li>
    <li> This somewhat pricey little gadget is a disappointment; turns out that at times the hair - which is embedded in  rather delicate skin - feels like it&#x27;s being pulled out and not trimmed. Given the opportunity, I would not buy it again</li>
    <li> DO NOT underestimate the need to trim your nose hair gentlemen (or sometimes ladies). It ranks up there with dirty underwear in terms of hygenic no no. Yes, it is a dirty job, but you must do it you want to look civilized. If you can pick your nose, you can trim your nosehair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Panasonic ER112 (electric trimmer), the small scissors that comes with the Swiss Army knife, and Groom Mate Platinum XL to trim my nose hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All 3 products I have used did their job well. But this Groom Mate Ultra Super Duper Deluxe Platinum-Gold XL is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ER112&#x27;s blades wore out after about a year and it completely stopped working after two years (its motor died). The Swiss Army scissors worked beautifully as well but its effectiveness was largely dependent on my skill. This product shaved my nosehair as close, if not closer, than the Pansonic&#x27;s electric trimmer with hardly any effort or skill on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The steel cutting mechanism do not wear out but it must be turned manually by hand. This device is also fairly small, about the size of an average sized pinky. Some say this product takes longer than the electric trimmers. True, but barely. I would say the electric trimmers takes about 1.5 minutes and this product takes about 3 minutes. Trust me, those extra 1.5 minutes are definitely worth it. It is similar to the difference you feel between an electric shave and a blade shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some say this trimmer hurts your nose. That would be true only if you are taking psychodelic drugs and imagine that your nosehairs are like your fingers. Please beware, if you can feel the bacteria on your nose, you might be able to feel the pain in your nose while this trimmer is massacring your nosehair by cutting them into pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Groom Mate Platinum XL is completely made of steel and does not feel flimsy like most electric trimmers. It is definitely designed to last and be effective over your lifetime.</li>
    <li> A bit like an old fashion push lawn mower as compared with a gas powered lawn mower...&lt;br /&gt;It works sort of....</li>
    <li> Good idea, poor execution.  Does not work at all, regardless of facial hair used on.  Maybe I received a unit that should have not made it through quality control.  It does not fulfill its function.  Finely crafted, all parts move, but it trims nothing.</li>
    <li> Probably need to use a few more times. First time, the trimmer plucked and pulled the hair not a smooth comfortable trimmer.</li>
    <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it strikes me as kind of expensive for what you&#x27;re getting.  On the other hand, it does what it is supposed to do quickly, easily, painlessly.  If you don&#x27;t mind the price, buy it!</li>
    <li> Ok, I know, I know - I was an idiot for not even reading a description of this item before buying it. But it&#x27;s frickin&#x27; manual!! It&#x27;s not electric. How retarded!! Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this tool after reading the excellent reviews. I wonder if I got the correct instrument? This thing is worthless! It is cumbersome to use and does not get the job done! I have resorted to using scissors. At least they snip the hairs!</li>
    <li> I have tried several hair trimmers over the years--small scissors, other manual trimmers, and all manner of electric trimmers.  This is my favorite because of how easy it is to use and how compact it is.  I used my last one for about 3 years before I dropped it in the sink, causing a small misalignment in the blades.  I just purchased a second one and with the proper care, it should last me a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;-The included brush is handy, but once in a while, clean it with a blast of compressed air and lube it with some food grade mineral oil to keep its operation smooth.  Dont just use any grease or oil because you are sticking this thing up your nose!&lt;br /&gt;-Always keep it in its case when you aren&#x27;t using it.&lt;br /&gt;-Use the proper technique:  After inserting it into your nose, don&#x27;t just turn it continuously in one direction--you are suppose to turn it back and forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Solid, simple construction.  No motor to fail.  Beefy blades that will probably never need sharpening.&lt;br /&gt;-No batteries to replace or charge.&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t pull hair or tickle my nose.&lt;br /&gt;-Compact&lt;br /&gt;-Made in the USA&lt;br /&gt;-Lifetime warranty&lt;br /&gt;-Stainless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Dont let the heft and robust appearance fool you, the cutting head does not take any abuse.  Any misalignment in the blades caused by a bump or drop and this thing will be pulling hair instead of cutting it.&lt;br /&gt;-The case, which is very necessary due to the first con I listed, seems like an afterthought.  Its just a cheap plastic piece of tubing with a cap.  Seems flimsy and does not provide much protection.  I am still looking for a better case.&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------&lt;br /&gt;8 YEAR Update:  Back for my third one today.  These are small and slippery little buggers.  One small drop into the sink or onto the floor and the blades will become irrecoverably misaligned turning this into a medieval torture device.  My second replacement didn&#x27;t operate as smoothly and required extra care not to pull hairs.  Still, you cant beat the simplicity of this device.  No batteries to worry about.  You can revoke my man card if you want, but I must also add that it doesn&#x27;t tickle my nose as much as electric trimmers.are not to pull hairs.

    <li> Bought Groom Mate Platinum for my husband.  He has many of the usual (and usually expensive) battery operated name brand ear and nose hair trimmers but they just never quite got the job done right.  After reading the directions with a 30 second practice learning curve, the results were everything he expected.  No batteries needed, easy to quickly clean and sanitize for your next use.  I anticipate another purchase to keep as a permanent addition in his travel toiletry case.  Very useful and handy grooming tool.  Thank you Groom Mate Platinum!</li>
    <li> Great idea, s***ty function. hard to rotate and hard to clean. i just use eyebrow scissors, much better.</li>
    <li> Product works well enough, but not better than ordinary pair of small scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again? Not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well crafted and solidly built.</li>
    <li> Heads up: Just because it is &amp;#34;battery free&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t mean that it plugs into the wall. I was looking for a corded trimmer so bought this &amp;#34;battery free&amp;#34; device. They got me. If you want an unpowered trimmer, then this is what you&#x27;re looking for. Good for camping or somewhere without power.</li>
    <li> I bought this nose and ear hair trimmer for my husband because I heard him complaining about using the clippers or the edge-up/trimmer and that it can&#x27;t reach in the unwanted areas. I decided to researched this product on Amazon and because of the wonderful reviews and feedback, gave it a try. This product is the best thing happening when it comes to my husband trimming his nose hairs. GREAT PRODUCT. He is satisfied. So, I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this! I was looking at electric trimmers and just happened to stumble upon a manual trimmer. I thought \\&quot;oh yes, no having to buy expensive batteries all the time for this!\\&quot;. The trimmer is very solid, feels pretty heavy for its size. I really like the fact that it is stainless and will not rust anytime in the future. I don&#x27;t know how everyone else uses these but I start twisting the device before I even put it in my nostril. As I ease it up in the nostril while twisting and turning, I feel absolutely nothing. At first, I wondered if it was even doing anything! A quick visual inspection of the nostril showed all of the lower hairs were cut very short! So for the first time in longer than I can remember, I can breathe out of my nose and I don&#x27;t have a tickling sensation. What a relief!     The only downside I have noticed is for the remainder of the day that you trim your nose hairs, the hairs feel sharp/prickly if I pinch my nostrils together. After about 24 hours, I can pinch my nostrils all I want and I don&#x27;t feel that prickly sensation. I would imagine any type of nose hair trimmers would cause this effect on me, so this is not a con for this product.     In conclusion, I am very very pleased with this product and hope it lasts a very long time. Thanks to all of the Amazon.com reviewers out there that help everyone make smarter and better informed decisions on the products here.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review for product purchased from Amazon (even though I get weekly packages) I have tried the other battery operated trimmers but they seem to only get the hairs high in the nostril, It seemed like the hair growth was getting worse by day, I figured I would give this a try, as soon as I got in the mail I opened it and used it, couldn&#x27;t believe the results!!! This product is simple and great. If you have no luck with the other battery operated trimmers and is looking for something new and for something that works. BUY THIS!!!  Extremely pleased.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this thing.  He says not having to deal with batteries or a plug is the best thing ever.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do jack... Unless you have the hairiest nostrol(s) in the world, use an electrical related machine rather than this crap</li>
    <li> I love a well made tool, especially one that does not require batteries or recharging: The Groom Mate Platinum XL is one of those tools.  Received the tool faster than I had thought.  It works amazingly well for the nostral and ear and has a very short learning curve.  Just insert and twist (the tool).  I ordered a second one to keep in my kayak/camping gear bag.</li>
    <li> I purchased an electric trimmer a while ago - a total waste of money.  The Groom Mate is entirely superior.  It&#x27;s easier to use and trims better.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend is very pleased with the trimmer. He said it&#x27;s nice and slick looking, it works well and easily trims without pulling his nose hair, and likes that it is manual/non-battery powered so he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about charging it.</li>
    <li> Now have something that I never need to replace the batteries in. It&#x27;s so easy to use and work without pulling out the hairs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m at that age when hair has begun sprouting from places it really shouldn&#x27;t. I got tired of plucking nose/ear hair and I even heard that plucking nose hair can cause serious infection. So, I found this little guy and things have gotten easier. I didn&#x27;t read the product description closely enough to realize this unit is operated manually by the user. A little learning curve, but using two hands ended up not being a big deal at all. Unit is constructed out of solid materials and feels like it could last a lifetime. Only reason it gets 4 stars is because I wish it trimmed a little closer to the skin, but any closer might cause cuts and knicks I suppose.</li>
    <li> I bought this item a little over a week ago, and when I first opened it, I couldn&#x27;t even get the darn thing to work, they say to wash it under hot water or in alcohol before use, so I did exactly that. And the trimmer would not rotate back and forth... It took letting it DRY first for the trimmer to begin working. When it did work, it only got the big hairs but noticed alot of other hairs where still left in my nose... Overall not too great of a product.... I thought it would be better considering all the reviews</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He  has used several trimmers before. He was impressed with this trimmer. He said that this was the best one around! He said that it did pull on some hairs, but it was not painful. It did what it was supposed to do and it worked very well.     This is a manual trimmer. It is not battery powered.</li>
    <li> If you want to throw money away this is the perfect way to do it. Only buy one that is electric operated. These people have done an incredible job marketing this garbage. It wasn&#x27;t worth returning. I through it away from disgust.</li>
    <li> Superbly constructed but 1) fails to trim as closely as the best in the field. Groom Mate has made the walls of the trimmer needlessly thick, which limits the closeness of the shave. Secondly, as with most other hand-powered personal groomers, both hands are employed using the device. Thus, no hand is free to manipulate, for example, the ears to get a closer, more thorough shave.   In closing, highly recommended- IF you&#x27;re going on an extended safari where batteries are in short supply.   Otherwise, there are battery-powered groomers out there that will deliver a better grooming experience.</li>
    <li> Very well built and effective. It feels like a large bullet. No hair pulling either, but what&#x27;s best is the lifetime guarantee.</li>
    <li> Totally blown away. This is a MUST OWN product for any man or woman who needs to do a little trimming on any area of your head. Panasonic knocked this one out of the park!</li>
    <li> Trims my hairs in places I don&#x27;t want it, its cheap, its doesn&#x27;t use batteries, I like it.</li>
    <li> I was and am quite impressed by this, while it was purchased for my travel dopp kitt, this has now replaced my battery operated version as its cleaner and smoother to operate. No pain!</li>
    <li> I like this trimmer alot. And despite the archaic technology that a lot of 1 star reviewers gave this, the mechanics of this thing works. At least it did - until the whole twist and turn process to trim stopped working. But because all of Groom Mate&#x27;s product&#x27;s come with a lifetime guarantee, I sent it back and was sent a replacement in a timely manner. Yeah, I know there are battery powered trimmers. Yeah, I know they&#x27;re quicker and faster. But I&#x27;m one of those that kind of hangs on to \\&quot;old school\\&quot; despite the abundance of quicker, faster, more expensive, fast and the furious nose hair trimmers.</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas gift and i honestly think the giver was trying to torture me!    Constantly pulls hairs, which hurts a lot and you constantly have to rotate the thing back and forth. Your wrist will give out before you are even done...    This thing is stupid...</li>
    <li> I like this old time hair remover. My father had one,I finally found one. Simple no batteries and stays sharp and clean.</li>
    <li> Good news is TSA lets you take this along (no scissors!). Bad news is it just barely works acceptably for the job (nose trimming).</li>
    <li> I have used many electric trimmers that snag in the hair you are trying to remove, and cause the entire process to be painful.    After searching high and low, I decided to get this nose and ear hair trimmer that was NOT electric, but manual. I had my reservations on how a unit without the need to batteries would work.     Although it may seem slightly expensive, to sum it up, it works great. It painlessly removes any difficult to find nose hair, and it doesn&#x27;t pull or cause any pain at all. The best part of this is - you just rinse this in running water, and all the small strands of hair that it has cut, is easily flushed away from this trimmer. Its significantly easier and less painful to use than any of the other electric trimmers that I have used in the past.    Its a great addition to any kit, and its light, compact and easy to store away. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> For those who still have to use a tweezers despite trimming their nose hair with a battery powered trimmer, this product is a wonderful solution.     I ordered this product for a project I had going on to minimizes all of my toiletries and be able to fit everything into my travel kit.  I was a bit skeptical during ordering, as I figured it would be like my current trimmer (which did not work that great) and how could such a thing work without battery power,  however went ahead and ordered it as I wanted something small to fit into my travel kit. Once I received it, I was blown away.  I the past I used my battery powered nose hair trimmer, however that didn&#x27;t completed do the job so I would use a tweezers to pluck the nose hair (boy was it painful).  This item COMPLETELY trimmed all of my nose hair and even did a great job on my ears as well!    Kudos to the inventor!</li>
    <li> I had a battery powered nose hair trimmer that lasted only a few years and it then just died.  I researched on the internet for a reliable replacement and found the Groommate XL.  This small well engineered devise was a wonderful find.  You place in a nostril and using two hands rotate the devise back and forth.  This action moves the very sharp blades in the cutting end and removes unwanted nasal and ear hair.  There is no pulling or pain involved.  There is no battery to be replaced nor motor to fail.  The unit is extremely well made and it works exceptional well.  I earnestly  recommend the product.  Five stars.   Steve</li>
    <li> Well, after years of using an electric trimmer from a well known gadget store, I ended up just using a small pair of scissors and straining to see in the mirror.  I was not happy with the hit or miss electric trimmer where I would have to go around and around, in and out and not to mention having to change the battery.  The electric shaver pulled a lot which I really did not appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;I saw this review on the Groom Mate Platinum XL in a leading men&#x27;s magazine and thought I would give it a try.  When I first used it, I was kind of disappointed because I thought it was not trimming.  I really did not feel any of the pulling or hear the sound of the straining motor I was used to.  I was pleasantly surprised that the trimmer was indeed doing it&#x27;s job. I would recommend it not only because it really works, but there is no need for batteries and it has a lifetime warranty.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is definitely something you don&#x27;t need to fear to try at home.  You don&#x27;t need to be a professional, just have a little common sense and at least one thumb and finger on each hand. Disclaimer.  If you only have two brain cells, one for inhale and one for exhale you may want to leave this product alone.    After using a couple of battery powered trimmers and watching them quickly wear out  over their short life expectancy, I looked for a simple easy to use and quality USA made product for a replacement.  I had been interested in a Tweezerman device that was basically designed like a tweezer, but it was like a paper punch you inserted into your nasal opening and then &#x27;punched out&#x27; the hairs.  Sounds like fun huh?  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t purchase one of those. This product was discontinued after about a year and I&#x27;m guessing for good reason.  It&#x27;s only positive value was it didn&#x27;t take up much space in a shaving kit.    If you are a American and you are typical, \\&quot;I want my stuff and I want it now\\&quot; then give the Groom Mate Platinum XL a try. You will be satisfied beyond belief. Unconditional lifetime warranty and full money-back customer satisfaction guarantee.  How can you go wrong?     Remember, stay away from those unreliable bulky battery powered trimmers that will fail you when you need them most.  After one use of the Groom Mate, you too will be able to go out in public and not worry about women turning away and little children running away screaming to their moms about the scary man.</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive about the non powered element from the beginning, but read such great reviews. It simply does not work for me. I do admit that the other battery powered ones are also difficult as well. I am still searching for an excellent trimmer that does not pull your hair out.</li>
    <li> This little bloodthirsty monster works absolutely fantastic 99% of the time - spin and trim, gets the stragglers that electric back-and-forth models miss, easy and fast.    Then there&#x27;s that 1%.  It transforms, magically, into an instrument of evil Torquemada would have included in his torture kit.  It becomes a little set of pilars, rather than a clipper.    Every so often it grabs a hair.  It doesn&#x27;t gently fondle the hair, and it doesn&#x27;t caress the hair, and it doesn&#x27;t bloody brush it: it grips it with the strength of ten frickin&#x27; Grinches, plus two, and...    It.    Will.    Not.    Let.    Go.    I sear I can hear it giggling over the sound of my screaming.</li>
    <li> This two handed trimmer is easy to use and painless after a month or so of use. Just a quick rinse under the facet and you are done. I think it is a great invention. If you are looking for something simple and easy to maintain, rugged and manly, then this is the product of choice.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and it really works.</li>
    <li> works fine but i like battery operated better .</li>
    <li> Sure it doesn&#x27;t use batteries, but that doesn&#x27;t make up for using two hands. You have to use the trimmer with two hands, and rotate it yourself.    My other complaint is that if you drop this device, it will likely be the last time you use it.   It will bend the metal teeth and cause it to no longer rotate.    At the same time, if you drop anything it has a chance of breaking.    It is ok, does not need batteries, but nothing special.</li>
    <li> A fine little device, very well made out of solid stainless steel. Simple design. I like that it is made in the USA</li>
    <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have waited so long to buy this. I&#x27;ve been through several electric nose hair trimmers, including a Phillips beard trimmer with a nose trimming attachment (what a waste that thing was), and all of them were more of a spinning pair of tweezers that simply pulled out the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose my nose hairs are a bit more husky than most peoples&#x27;. It runs in the family. Anyway, I&#x27;ve been looking at this thing for a while thinking what a novel idea it was, but that it might not work too far beyond the novelty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Box opening revealed a tiny little thing that made me wonder how much dexterity it would require to use this it on my nose and ears. The answer is not much. You just move it around in small, slow circles while slowly twisting the bottom half back and forth. It was so painless I didn&#x27;t really think it did anything, but in reality, it was easily twice as fast (also totally painless) as any other trimmer I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No batteries. No cord. A tiny little plastic sleeve about three inches (more like two and a half--I didn&#x27;t measure it) and about 5/8ths of an inch in diameter is all the space it takes up in my shaving kit for travel. Using around my ears was just as easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly--the Groom Mate (Platinum XL if that makes a difference) is totally painless and (as long as you have two hands) is mindlessly simple to use. If you can&#x27;t use it, there&#x27;s something wrong with you. If it&#x27;s hurting you, you&#x27;re using it wrong. Slow down (both nostrils and ears took less than two minutes to trim) and use your brain in addition to your hands and you won&#x27;t have any problems. You&#x27;ll thank yourself, and wonder why you didn&#x27;t do it sooner, as I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also--the little screw allows you to take it apart for thorough cleaning (not really needed; you can rinse it) and oil it if it seems like it isn&#x27;t turning easily enough. The scissors don&#x27;t look as if they will ever dull by the way it was constructed. If it will trim my nostril forest, it will trim anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say it would be the last trimmer I&#x27;ll ever buy, but I will probably order a few more to stash one permanently in my travel kit, and a spare in case one rolls off the counter into the heating duct. If you&#x27;re organized that won&#x27;t be an issue for you, but I&#x27;m not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 1/26/14:&lt;br /&gt;I now understand the negative reviews. My trimmer rolled off of the counter and onto the floor. After that, it never worked right and I had to replace it. It is surprisingly fragile; if it pulls hairs out when you get it, it was likely mistreated during handling and should be replaced. It worked beautifully until I dropped it.</li>
    <li> Well let&#x27;s see... no batteries, small and compact, solid metal, and it gets the job done. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple months now and it&#x27;s performed well for me. Simple yet elegant design, the way things should be. Not the cheapest out there but worth the money imo.</li>
    <li> Solidly built and works great. No need for batteries is a real plus.</li>
    <li> Used this trimmer for years and love it.</li>
    <li> Pros: Simple and effective. Seems like it will last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I cant thing of any possible wagt that this could be a bad item</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer after reading the reviews. Don&#x27;t believe the hype. It did not do a very good job and I wasted my money. Using it was a slow process. It also pulled instead of cut the hairs. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Buy the best nose hair trimmer made, and forget about all those battery powered nose buzzers forever. Excellent product, flawless design, easy to clean, and it never misses a beat. The trim action feels like a sharp pair of Fiskars scissors, but I sincerely doubt you could actually cut yourself with these if you tried. After being seriously dissatisfied with a lesser battery model (Remington), I can assure you that these are in a completely different league.</li>
    <li> This thing seems to be constructed just fine, but the results just aren&#x27;t what I expected.  First off, it is awkward to use.  I was never quite sure when I was actually cutting hairs or just doing nothing.  It&#x27;s a bit hard to know how far in to ram the device to get the hairs.  It takes a long time and a lot of experimentation before you can get trimmed.  Have one or two stray hairs you want to quickly trim with this?  Forget about that!&lt;br /&gt;  Granted, this is coming from a guy who is accustomed to having NOTHING in his nose.  I&#x27;ve been using a battery powered trimmer for years, and I cut my nosehairs to the point where they aren&#x27;t just trimmed- they&#x27;re gone.  That is not even possible with this thing.  If you&#x27;re a hippie or just bushy and unkempt or don&#x27;t mind a few hairs as long as they don&#x27;t extend beyond the nostril, this product might suit you.  If you want clear nostrils, you&#x27;re going to have to go with one of the crappy battery-powered models.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for to put in my suitcase.  No one had this item \\&quot;over the counter\\&quot;.  If it&#x27;s like one I had before, I have to remember to clean and lube it occasionally.</li>
    <li> No one likes nose hair. The GroomMate XL is a compact and pivitol piece of any man&#x27;s shower bag.</li>
    <li> I had a battery operated trimmer before, but I didn&#x27;t like it because it tickled my nose. Yeah, kinda lame but it did make me search for a manual trimmer. I bought Groom Mate with high expectations and was not disappointed! I was surprised at how solid this unit is. It definitely has a substantial feel to it. It performs as a trimmer should with no hair pulling. It&#x27;s easy to use and is compact so I can take it anywhere and it hardly uses any space in my medicine cabinet. The stainless construction means easy maintenance. I&#x27;m very happy with this trimmer and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The husband wanted to buy this based on reviews from the Something Awful forum.  He loves it and says the quality and build is very good and not likely to break.</li>
    <li> This is a very well built tool and it does work well for getting out nose hairs. I haven&#x27;t had any type of ripping the hairs out with this unlike an electric one I used to have. I just wish it came with a usable case to store it in.</li>
    <li> If you are like me and seem to grow alot of nose hair and are tired of the noise and pulling from your electric clippers then you have to get this trimmer. I bought this product by reading the reviews only and I must say I am blown away from the ease of trimming nose and ear hair. It&#x27;s heavy and solidly made and cuts hair without any pulling. I look forward to using it again to make sure the first time wann&#x27;t a fluke. Buy it, you will not be dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years now, and it still works great.  You just need to be sure to follow the directions closely so you don&#x27;t get the dreaded yank of nostril hairs.  It is very well made and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer bar none! I have tried battery powered ones that break or do not work properly. This is small but made of solid stainless with a nice heft to it. I will never need another trimmer.</li>
    <li> I have tried several battery-powered devices for clipping ear and nose hair, but none of them work as well as this manual trimmer.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these nose hair trimmers a couple of years ago and it started to get stuck a few months ago. I remembered the product had an &#x27;unconditional unlimited warranty&#x27;, so I figured I&#x27;d see how that worked. I emailed them about the problem, and they immediately responded that they would send me another one. A week later, and the new trimmer arrived in the mail. I&#x27;m amazed at the service here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this nose hair trimmer, no matter what, you can be assured that you will always have a nose hair trimmer. It&#x27;s built solid, but in case something does happen they are quick to replace it. They really stand behind their product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product backed with excellent customer service.</li>
    <li> I bought this nose hair trimmer a few months back and loved it....  The first try.  Every time since it has caught and plucked my hairs out rather than cut them.  I wanted to give it a chance and it has been a big disappointment.  Stay away.</li>
    <li> So for years I have been using those dorky little scissors for trimming nose hair, and I finally got fed up and started doing some research.  I travel a lot and I didn&#x27;t want anything battery operated nor huge.  I stumbled on this on a shaving website and was rather intrigued.  Anyways I should have bought a decent nose hair trimmer years ago, not that I had hair going everywhere it was trimmed but I used this puppy and I&#x27;m able to breath a lot easier then I could before.  Worked wonders, even for running I can breath in more air, well it seems like it anyways.  Could be I am just shocked at how naked m nose feels now.  Highly recommended easy to use, does;t catch my nose hairs!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I liked the idea of having a trimmer that doesn&#x27;t require electricity. It cut the hair however it frequently pulls the hair.</li>
    <li> These work great!  They are also made in USA!!!! Thanks!  You can buy replacement blades should you need them also.  I hope this product stays around for a long time.</li>
    <li> its a well made piece of american machinery, Groom mate, pro American, everything they do is made in the Good ole US of A,&lt;br /&gt;, this company is unbelievable , if ALL American companies operated like this , we would be perfect in every way- self sufficient and would be relied upon by other countries INSTEAD of relying on them--------as far as i am concerned this is the true Spirit of American patriotism , ingenuity and concerns for the customer, while still making acceptable monetary gain-------I have yet to SEE this kind of /depth of , respect for customers -------------OLD TIME American thinking is back in town, Built to last&lt;br /&gt;I could say more, but i think i have hit the mark</li>
    <li> Owned one of these for over a year now, works as advertised and is easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t show any signs of corrosion. In regards to some of the other reviews that claim that these &amp;#34;pull hair&amp;#34; it may be due more to errant arm or hand movements while rotating the cutter. I found that by supporting the cutter by resting my hand against my face while twisting the cutter knob with my other hand to provide the best pain free experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or you could just man up and yank those suckers out a pinch at a time and grin through the pain.</li>
    <li> Pulls hair pretty good.</li>
    <li> Yes the product is awkward to hold and operate at first but you can get use to that.  My problem is it does not get close enough to the skin.  I do not want any visible hair in my nose, and this product does not cut close enough to the skin to avoid this.  Furthermore, they claim that the product does not pull hair, but it does.  I have not used it one full time without it pulling some of the hairs.</li>
    <li> ABOUT MY OLD TRIMMER    I used to use a rather inexpensive battery operated nose/ear hair trimmer.  It was really underpowered -- the rotary blade would get stuck easily, and I was lucky just to get the blessed thing to turn on.  Plus, I did not like having to deal with YABOD -- Yet Another Battery Operated Device.  If it runs on batteries, they either have to be charged or replaced, and that&#x27;s a nuisance -- the more YABODs you have, the bigger a nuisance it is.  I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of cheap electric trimmers in my time (mostly for beards), and they just don&#x27;t last.      ABOUT MY NEW TRIMMER    I was attracted to Groom Mate&#x27;s Platinum XL because it is battery-free (not YABOD!) and manually powered (thus never underpowered).  The quality of this item is superb -- it looks and feels absolutely indestructible.  It comes with a lifetime warranty, and it&#x27;s easy to see why:  This thing will never break or wear out.      TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO    If you&#x27;re accustomed to a battery-operated trimmer, working a two-handed manual trimmer does take a little getting used to.  I have to admit that the first time I tried it, I thought it didn&#x27;t work.  I realized that it DID work when I saw all the little hairs in the sink after I rinsed it out, and (forgive me if this seems gross) all the little hairs in a tissue after I blew my nose.  (I always blow my nose after trimming so that I don&#x27;t inhale loose hairs.)      TRY IT, YOU&#x27;LL LIKE IT    Once I realized that the Platinum XL does in fact work, I really went to town on the ol&#x27; nostrils.  It used to be an unruly jungle up there.  Now, my nostrils are a thing of beauty!  :-)  Actually, two things of beauty, if you want to get technical about it.    Best of all, after using this product, I literally breathe easier!  Thanks to an unimpeded flow of air, my brain is getting more oxygen.  Now my brain can run faster, jump higher, and solve difficult math problems without even breaking a sweat.      Yes, this one product is going change my whole life.  Well, not really -- but at least I&#x27;ll look well-groomed while I&#x27;m living it.  Plus, I&#x27;ve reduced my YABOD count by one.  Sometimes, less really is more!</li>
    <li> What can i say,it&#x27;s great product.Small,aesy to handle(you have to use both of your arms).You don&#x27;t need no battery with it.Works great!!</li>
    <li> When I ordered it I thought it was battery operated or rechargable. I would not have ordered it having known it was a manual operated item. It seems to work okay but I would rather have an automatic type.</li>
    <li> I was surprised that this was not battery powered. It seems to do a good job but is difficult to use.</li>
    <li> Good, well made construction.  Nice sleek design.  However, only mildly effective compared to other alternatives.</li>
    <li> Well, it ain&#x27;t perfect and it takes some effort but overall, it works better than any other device I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;d just like to know the reason that the older you get, the more hair grows in embarrassing places. What?  There were no hair follicles in our ears and noses when we were young?</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this will work until I use it. Especially I thought some of my hair may wind up to inner parts and it might hurt. After I use it, it turns out there is no such issue. It works fantastic.    Pros :   1. Very durable. It is made of pieces of metal. This is important because many electronic ones (e.g. panasonic) tend to break after a while.  2. Affordable price.    Cons : (all minor issues)  1. They put some oil in it and you will smell it at the first time.  2. After using it, it is a kind of hard to wash your hair off from this device. I use running water.  3. It is manual, but I like it because it saves money.</li>
    <li> I am still trying to get accustomed to using this trimmer; I have had it about a month. It does a great job on clearing out the nose hairs, but I am unable to get the ear hairs. It seems well constructed and like it will last me a long, long time.</li>
    <li> Very solidly built and works well.  Very good trimming hair and haven&#x27;t experienced any hair pulling using it.  Since its manual, not as quick as using an motorized trimmer.  There&#x27;s a strong metal smell when using it in the nose, for obvious reasons.</li>
    <li> Okay, we both liked the fact that this little trimmer was:&lt;br /&gt;constructed of sturdy metal;&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t depend on batteries to operate;&lt;br /&gt;and was made in the good old USA&lt;br /&gt;...however, we are both too scared to use it.&lt;br /&gt;The operating process is basically a simple one; just slowly and gently move your trimmer around your nasal passage with one hand, while twisting and turning the other end of the trimmer (which runs the blade) with your other hand.  Simple, right?&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that it can be a little tough to hold the business end of the trimmer steady while cranking the other end.  Sadly after a couple of experiences of it grabbing a nose hair and ripping it out by the roots (user error, surely...brings tears to my eyes just at the memory) we have gone back to the old battery operated chinese trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;*sigh*&lt;br /&gt;If you are more steady of hand, please support this company and buy one!</li>
    <li> For some reason I thought this had good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just didn&#x27;t work, or didn&#x27;t work well enough, so I only used it a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased the  Panasonic ER415SC instead.</li>
    <li> This trimmer beats all the others for ease of use and getting the job done. I have several and find them handy and effective.</li>
    <li> best tool easy to use</li>
    <li> Very easy to use, and very high quality product made right here in the USA!  It cleanly cuts the hairs every time.</li>
    <li> got as a gift, great quality and price.  also a subtle yet good way to tell your loved ones to groom themselves!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year. It does not cut hair close enough. Nasal hair is still visible. If I press the trimmer against my skin it does cut closer but then it irritates my nasal skin and it is still not close enough.</li>
    <li> Misleading thought it was battery powered. How are you supposed to trim hair in a delicate area with this device. What a joke.</li>
    <li> I have had my Groom Mate Nose Hair Trimmer for over 6 months now and love it. Prior to this I used the electric made in china nose hair trimmers ~ not anymore. This one is faster and easier to use with no cuts or scrapes. Groom Mate, please make a shaver so I can ditch my Braun.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this, as the solidity of the metal and the freedom from batteries really appealed to me.  Sadly, it just doesn&#x27;t trim close enough.  We&#x27;re probably going to order a different one.</li>
    <li> Love this thing.  It&#x27;s a perfect little piece of ingenuity and engineering, and its something that I feel like I&#x27;ll have bouncing around in my shaving kit for the rest of my life.  If anything, it could use a little carrying container that might last as long as it will.</li>
    <li> Much better put together than the automatic nose hair trimmers.  I was a little disconcerted how much effort the company puts into getting negative reviews down, but I am a happy camper.  I decided to buy this because at least in all the negative reviews, the reviewers were given a full refund.  These guys seem willing to stand behind their product.  I can understand that because it seems like it is made to last.</li>
    <li> My husband is very pleased with this. He previously had a battery operated trimmer which worked okay, and he was skeptical of this hand powered version.  But he prefers it now and thinks it works great.</li>
    <li> I have been frustrated for years with electric clippers and small scissors.  These having failed me, I often resorted to pulling hairs and fantasizing about a device of this calibre.  This is an excellent long overdue product.  They have nailed it on the head.  The last device of this nature I expect I will need to purchase for myself considering its design, build quality, and warranty.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 Panasonic and 1 Remington battery operated nose/ear hair trimmers and not only did none of them do the job as well as this one, they all failed in less than a year, one in a month.  Since this one is manual and very good build quality, I expect it to last forever.  It&#x27;s easy to use and better yet, made in the U.S.A.</li>
    <li> The blades and nice and sharp and I love the simple design of it, and maybe for someone with the occasional, fine nose hair it&#x27;s good enough.  For me, it would have to have a high speed motor attached.  If you get it in there and spin it really quickly with the other hand, maybe it won&#x27;t make your eyes tear-up.  There is certainly some technique required because if you (or if I) just stick it in my nose and twist the parts between my fingers as you would normally expect to be sufficient, all it does is grab a nice big purchase and yank them all out.  I could do that with pliers.  I&#x27;ve bought two of the Phillips ones so I have one in my travel kit and one in my house, they work great and only require one hand.</li>
    <li> I use it.  It sometimes pulls a hair but that&#x27;s expected.  It does the job. There may be powered versions that work without hair pulling.</li>
    <li> This is the best nose and ear trimer in the world. The only maintence you will have to do it is none. It will last a life time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really baffled by how many good reviews there are for this product.  Oh well, all I can do is relate my own experience, and that is that this product is a complete waste.  It just flat out doesn&#x27;t work (well).  I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s that the blade isn&#x27;t sharp enough or long enough, of just that it is poorly designed and conceived.  Whatever.  Time to move on to another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I recently bought the Panasonic ER421KC and like it MUCH better.  It just eliminates hair much much more effectively.  It costs a little more, but boy is it worth it.</li>
    <li> From the price and the pictures that I looked at, I thought this was going to be much different and larger product - an electric device that you hold in the palm of your hand, that trims wherever you point it.  I didn&#x27;t see the other picture of the guy holding this little thing in his fingertips.  (I don&#x27;t think this photo was part of the page when I was shopping.)  In that sense I was disappointed with what I received, and $20 is a bit steep for what it does.       That being said, the little bugger does work.  Ya gotta twist it back and forth, but it does the job.  The lifetime guarantee makes it sound like it&#x27;ll be working for a long time, too.  But it should be half the price.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t even get how it worked.</li>
    <li> I bought this on the strength of all the positive reviews.  I have a Panasonic and a Remington cheapie and both work OK.  I had a cheaper manual trimmer with turned out to be useless.  So I was skeptical.  But the Groom Mate cuts more cleanly than the powered units, no irritation.  It just does the job quickly, quietly, &amp; accurately.  What else could you want.  No batteries and it&#x27;s the size of a styptic pencil.  It&#x27;s a solid &amp; elegant piece of equipment and I hope to have it a long time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading the excellent reviews. This non battery operated item is practically useless piece of junk.    Simply put it is useless and notworth $20 bucks you are paying....</li>
    <li> Works great and is a quality product.  I got if for my husband and he found it easy to use and liked it. My father in law, who is 74 was not able to use it because he doesn&#x27;t use his hands that well and couldn&#x27;t turn it like a person with full use of their hands.  So, keep that in mind depending on the user.</li>
    <li> I bought this couple months back just haven&#x27;t had time to review. I really like this groom mate. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t pull on your hairs or anything. I first saw it at the Art of Shaving Store but the price there was so inflated. It was just over priced so I looked online and found it here for a better price. Like I said it&#x27;s a really cool little groomer to have , no batteries needed and it does the job. Easy to clean</li>
    <li> High quality- better results than the battery-operated trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little trimmer is amazing.  It is kind of retro; you twist the bottom of it to turn the blades.  Think push lawn mower vs. gas-powered mower.  Somehow it works better.  The blades are sharper, it&#x27;s smaller, it just works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you turn it too slow, it will &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; a bit and that will hurt.  So turn it faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantages:&lt;br /&gt;-smaller&lt;br /&gt;-no battery&lt;br /&gt;-sharper blades than battery trimmers&lt;br /&gt;-high quality&lt;br /&gt;-works better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;br /&gt;-takes a tiny bit of coordination to use</li>
    <li> How could they tell me in health class sixty years ago that without a device like this I would one day come to resemble a male warthog?  It does the job very well, preserving my marriage of 43 years.</li>
    <li> I wanted an electric groomer with a charger (no batteries), and this one is anything but.  It is a manual gadget that advertises &amp;#34;no batteries.&amp;#34;  I would like to return it, but I am unsure how to do it.</li>
    <li> My experience so far it that this nose hair trimmer works just as advertised.  It is easy to use, quick, and efficient.  Sure a lot better than sticking scissors up my nose, or trying to pull them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will probably last forever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased &amp; used the nose/ear trimmers with &amp;#34;springs&amp;#34; in the past and encountered&lt;br /&gt;lots of problems.  The springs tend to snap / break after a while - therefore the rotating&lt;br /&gt;mechanism is certainly more durable &amp; recommended.  Great Job Groom Mate &amp; keep it up!</li>
    <li> Pulls hair out by roots. Next day some dried blood on my nose. So bad will review this on facebook.</li>
    <li> Seems counter intuitive, but this really does work better than the electric offerings out there.  Fantastic solid construction and smooth action.  Instead of a flimsy plastic thingie that never has a charge and tears out the hair after a few months of use this is solid stainless, never needs a charge, and stays sharp.  Plus it is small enough to keep in a travel toiletry kit but stout enough for home use, and you won&#x27;t have to worry about finding some place to plug it in.</li>
    <li> I was delighted to find the groom mate online. However reality of this product and customer service is another issue.    1. Hairs were still pulled, even though it was brand new (ouch!)  2. Flaw in design: no edge to prevent rolling (mine rolled off the vanity on day 2).  3. The exterior teeth are VERY fragile, mine rolled off and bent a tooth, I tried to readjust the bent tooth to no avail.  4. The service address supplied on the package is NOT real (this was about two years ago), I sent mine back with a letter stating I wanted a new part, and the entire package came back with USPS claiming the address was not valid.    I haven&#x27;t dared buy a new one since.    -A Dissatisfied Customer</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I believed most of the reviews and purchased this product. Not very happy with the product and I am now back to purchase a battery or rechargable one. This might be a nice extra one to have for traveling, but doesn&#x27;t really do a good job and sometimes it hurts. Motorized ones are so much easier to use.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews for this product and all were positive. Well I have been using this product painfully for a month now. I thought it only fair before leaving a review. I like the style and the fact that it take no batteries, but that&#x27;s it. It pull the hairs out rather then cuts and doesn&#x27;t get the small ones. If pain doesn&#x27;t bother you, then this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> I had a $6.99 battery powered trimmer before, but that one is dying after two years of very intermittent use.  So I decided to look for something more durable, easy to clean and maintain.  This product fits all my needs.  I used it only once so far, but I am already impressed at how it trims much better than the cheaper battery powered one.  Plus, the lifetime warranty and I am completely sold.  I think this trimmer is the best Made in the USA product that I ever purchased in the recent years.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Solid and well built</li>
    <li> This is better, however it doesn&#x27;t always work as advertised.Sometimes it can&#x27;t cut the nose hairs like I thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;Richard Builta&lt;br /&gt;jjodiklb@verizon.net</li>
    <li> This does what it says, it&#x27;ll click your nose hairs and leave you with a open airway. My issue is this thing caused a couple of ingrown hairs and wild sneezing fits because of how its used. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, i like it, but just be wary how far up you go and how much you shave away.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is hard to use and maintain (you need a screwdriver to assemble and disassemble it every time you need to clean it).  It pulls the hairs and does not cut the small ones.  Go for the electric one!!!</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive about this product. I just didn&#x27;t see how something like this could work. When I got this product and tried it for the first time and I was greatly surprised. It cut those pesky little hairs with ease, and without any worry of cutting myself.  The only negative about this product, is that it just doesn&#x27;t cut the hairs quite as close as I would like. Otherwise, it is a pretty decent product.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, very durable and light weight.  Easy to keep clean and handy. Durable outer coating, do not have to worry about rust forming.</li>
    <li> All I can say is &amp;#34;Wow!&amp;#34;  The item arrived today, and I was honestly surprised by how solid and well-built this trimmer is.  I won&#x27;t go into gruesome detail about my first time using it (after all, we know what it is designed to do), but I was impressed by how quickly and effortlessly it accomplished its task.  Because there was no discomfort at all, I didn&#x27;t think that it was working.  But it does...very well.  After no more than five minutes or so, I was ready to clean and store the trimmer in its handy case.  Perhaps the best $20 I&#x27;ve spent in quite some time.</li>
    <li> I have tried several battery operated nose hair clippers and none worked to my satisfaction. The Groom Mate, which is manually operated does the trick. It is a great product!</li>
    <li> Not sure this is even working. If it is, it doesn&#x27;t seem to do a good job.</li>
    <li> it works great! I saw some reviews condemning it for pulling hair, was pleased to find no problem  as long as you were turning trimmer as you moved it inside the ear &amp; nose.</li>
    <li> This does has a tiny learning curve- you don&#x27;t want to pinch your nose skin. Once you take a minute to figure out how it cuts, this thing is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tiny size, no batteries, lifetime guarantee, very few parts- how much more could I ask for?</li>
    <li> ... stuck in the boons without batteries or your electric unit has broken down.  The unit is of high quality all metal construction.  But it really does not cut it functionally versus the electric units.  It is the worst nose trimmer I have tested in terms of closeness of the shave, cuts to the nose (I drew about 10 drops of blood upon my first effort), and painful hair pulls.  I generally like low tech quality alternatives but not in this case.</li>
    <li> This item is complete garbage comparing to modern electric groomers.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it after reading all good reviews just to try it after my Panasonic got old and a little dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how anybody can give it 5 star, maybe all those people just used scissors before...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;- It DOES NOT cut the hair close to skin, so you still have it in your nose.&lt;br /&gt;- It does not &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; like electric ones, so you have to kind of catch hairs in groomer openings. Well, it&#x27;s not hard, but really takes time.&lt;br /&gt;- It does cut pretty well while it&#x27;s new and sharp, but even being new it pulls them sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs(often mentioned in other reviews):&lt;br /&gt;- Solid steel piece which you will pass to your grand kids as exotic artifact from past era.&lt;br /&gt;- It will not break. Obviously. Like those flimsy plastic electric machines, which you have to replace in a year or two.&lt;br /&gt;- Does not need batteries. This is very important if you live somewhere in the middle of north woods 5 days on canoe from closest gas station and still need to look your best.&lt;br /&gt;- Made in America. If this is important for you - you have no choice but to enjoy this groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short. Do not waste your money and buy some normal electric groomer. They are not perfect, but are an order of magnitude more useful.</li>
    <li> Looks and works beautifully the first time out.  After flushing with water, the second useage, it would not spin.  Dismantled and took a metal file to the cutter blade.  Then it kinda works again.  Keep it away from water!</li>
    <li> A bit over rated product from my point of view. It do what should be done, but result sometimes questionable. Due to its design, it cuts long hair with some experience, however has issues with shorter ones.</li>
    <li> After tossing out other trimmers that break all too soon, I was very happy to get this manual trimmer that can&#x27;t possibly break.  It&#x27;s a nice little piece of machine work.</li>
    <li> This is a very nicely crafted instrument that is virtually worthless for its intended purpose.  I would suggest getting a battery powered non-rotary device such as that made by Norelco.</li>
    <li> The Groom mate is a simple trimmer that keeps your unwanted nose hairs in check with ease. It is easy to use, easy to clean, and easy to store. It&#x27;s design provides almost no way for it to break. Just insert he groom mate and twist the bottom half to trim. My girl is most pleased to no longer be bothered by my grosser facial hair.</li>
    <li> The trimmer appears well made, performs acceptably and is a decent value, but I was surprised that it is NOT powered. To cut hair, you have to twist one end while holding the center firmly. That can be awkward and tiresome.</li>
    <li> To operate you must use both hands. Try that on removing hair on your ears. Very impracticle so I have asked for a refund. Let&#x27;s see if I get it so I can buy one with a battery</li>
    <li> Good product. Does what it says, it cleanly and painlessly removes nose hair. It takes a few more \\&quot;twists\\&quot; than expected to clip hairs, but it gets the job done. It seems like an extremely durable product.</li>
    <li> My last trimmer was a solid metal Brookstone version which worked great until the metal spring snapped in mid stroke -- ouch.  Visited Amazon immediately to see if the world had invented a better nose hair trimmer. This one received many complementary reviews and I tried it.  For those of you with nose hairs the size of pipe cleaners, this baby will do the trick! The weight is SOLID and it works like a machete on kudzoo.  This was a good buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through various nose hair trimmers and none come close to the Groom Mate. It is extremely well made and I believe that it will last me a lifetime assuming I don&#x27;t lose it. Best part: no more batteries, no fiddling with fragile nose hair trimmers that break so easily, no pulling or tearing hairs and no pain whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Friday, December 31, 2010&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product for some time now and it is very good at removing longer hair, however, to complete the grooming process I still need to resort to using a small pair of scissors. I find myself reaching for the scissors more often than the Groom Mate.</li>
    <li> Solid, durable tool. Have had it for a few years and still works well. I would like it if it cut a bit closer, but still useful and worth the money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine. A bit complicated to use with two hands. I think a small round tipped scissors is the best solution.</li>
    <li> Being older and having longer hair all over, this is a sturdy hand held device that needs no batteries and will last a life time.</li>
    <li> I have used this type of trimmer for years.  It is easy to use, does a great job with little up keep!!</li>
    <li> The concept sounds good.  Hand powered device, no batteries, well crafted.  But it hurts to use every time.  After trying a few times, I just threw it away in favor of the Phillips Norelco D-Finer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the manufacturer is reading this, the problem does not appear to be the cutting surfaces; instead the problem appears to be the need to smooth the edges of the surface that touch the skin.  These edges are fairly sharp for no functional reason.  If the outer surfaces were rounded slightly and polished smoothed, this device would be a winner.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy, with a practical and novel design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just twist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great if your expectations are moderate... however it is not necessarily adept at hitting all the angles inside a narrow aperture... like, say, a nostril.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it is certainly a cool device, but it takes a little finesse to be able to contort this little (and it is tiny!) device to all the areas and angles needed for complete trim perfection.</li>
    <li> Great product great price. Works well I was very aprehensive for awhile, worrying I was going to yank out hair or cut my self. It doesn&#x27;t seem to go dull like the electric ones.&lt;br /&gt; The first one I bought I paid 60$ at The Art Of Shaving and they told me it was hand made in Germany. No wonder it didn&#x27;t come in the packaging, I would have known they are full of it. The only reason I have to get anouther one is I dropped mine on the tile floor and it bent one of the blades.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Only received it last week, but as stated in many other comments, this little jewel is well built in the great US of A!  I doubt many things have been manufactured in the US, with this type of craftsmanship, since around WWII.  Best I can tell thus far, it absolutely works as advertised.  Though it does leave small remnants of hair, it cuts closer than any other electronic device or scissors, I&#x27;ve ever utilized.  I too have cut the inside of my nose on several occasions and could barely finish the trimming work due to the inadvertent tears rolling down my face.  I&#x27;ve had zero pain with the Groom Mate Platinum XL.  I&#x27;ve experience a couple of pulls here and there, though not the automatic, eye-watering events.  Mostly due to not adequately spinning when maneuvering the tool.  Operator error.</li>
    <li> Brutal!! Doesn&#x27;t cut the hair. It pulls the hair... Also gave me an infection the first time I used it. Awful product !!! Do not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> It is very well machines and everything fits together very well. It won&#x27;t pull on the hairs if you go slow, but I just find electric trimmers to be faster and more efficient. This would probably be great for travel or when you need to use it in a setting that you don&#x27;t want to make a buzzing noise. Otherwise I would say get an electric trimmer.</li>
    <li> When I first opened up the trimmer I didn&#x27;t bother to even read the instruction(how hard could a manual powered nose hair trimmer be). Well....painful was my answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after reading the instructions it says use a back and forth(counter and counter-clockwise) motion of the blades. Don&#x27;t just turn the knob in one direction or it will yank your hairs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After, using it the proper way I haven&#x27;t had one hair get pulled out and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I was excited at the prospect of a well-built, stainless trimmer that would not require batteries.  What I got was a mediocre, incompletely trimming, often-times hair pulling apparatus.  Bummer.</li>
    <li> This tool is bomb proof stainless steel and it works as it should. Should have purchased this item years ago. Arrived in one day... Flawless transaction</li>
    <li> I bought this well-engineered piece of stainless steel in Oct. 2009; it is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever encountered. It&#x27;s intuitive to use, doesn&#x27;t require batteries, is easily portable, easy to clean, and most importantly, DOESN&#x27;T PULL HAIRS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never had a single problem with it, until about a week ago--I&#x27;d recently moved, and the moving help I had apparently wasn&#x27;t the most careful. I went to use it, and it wouldn&#x27;t turn freely anymore. I&#x27;m assuming it must have fallen out of the box and landed on the cutting end. I emailed the company with my Amazon invoice, and they immediately shipped a new one to me, no questions asked! They even told me to keep the old one, in case I needed a spare set screw for the new one. It arrived today, and the quality and ease of use is identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product, and responsive, responsible, and friendly customer service that stands by their product even 3 years later. They&#x27;ve got a loyal customer and an evangelist for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: June 2016&lt;br /&gt;Now, over 6 years later, this thing is still working perfectly. I rinse it out under hot tap water every time I use it, and blow out the extra water before putting it back in the cabinet. I have NEVER had it pull a hair *unless* I moved the trimmer without twisting. In other words, if it&#x27;s in my nose, I&#x27;m twisting it until after it out of my nose. Again, I have never had it pull a hair otherwise. Just don&#x27;t stop turning it while you move it around, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> If you need to eliminate all traces of nose hairs from your nose, then this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you are just an average Joe like me that just wants to keep nose hairs in check without using tweezers then this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure and rotate the blades back and forth, not all the way around 360 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never used this for ear hair, that would require more coordination/reach that I have.&lt;br /&gt;(EDIT) I have had this long enough to grow old enough for ear hair to be a problem, and yes even a uncordinated person like me can use this to get rid of extra long ear hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No batteries, small, solid construction, low price, seems to stay sharp after 5 years, easy to disassemble (only one screw) and clean if needed.&lt;br /&gt;(EDIT) Its been a while longer and I still use the same unit. Blades are still getting the job done and I have never even thought of getting a new or different trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this unit gets the job done good enough for me as an average guy.&lt;br /&gt;But if you need those nose hairs cut so short you could be on the cover of a magazine, then get something else.</li>
    <li> This mechanical twister easily gets rid of those annoying nose hairs, doesn&#x27;t use a battery, and actually is a lot more sturdy and solid than I expected. Good on you, Mate!</li>
    <li> initially, it didn&#x27;t pull.  after a few months of use, it pulls and snags nostril hairs.  can be quite... uh... invigorating in the morning.</li>
    <li> high quality construction seems to stay sharp even after a few years. It also gives a nice cut and doesn&#x27;t pull hair</li>
    <li> Great for travel and vacation</li>
    <li> Excellent transaction and product.</li>
    <li> Nice machining, but does not cut well.  Cutting end walls to thick to cut close.  Cutting end sheath can be a little sharp too.</li>
    <li> not as good as i thought it would be but will be handy to travel with. easily cleaned as described</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing.  Works much better than any electric model I have tried.  Yes it has pulled a hair or two and it hurts like hell when it does.....  It is more than worth it.  When I first tried it, I didn&#x27;t even realize it had worked.  I looked in the top of the trimmer trying it for the first time and it was full of hair.  I was amazed.  This thing is well built and will never use an electric again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I have been using this a few months now.  I have figured out how to avoid the hair pulling.  It is all about technique.  Make sure you keep spinning the trimmer when you remove it from your nose and you won&#x27;t yank any hairs.  If you stop spinning and then remove it, sometime hairs get caught in the cutters mid clip and it will yank them out if you remove it while it is not spinning.</li>
    <li> cumbersome and painful to use. it sort of works but not nearly as good or painless as a pair of small scissors</li>
    <li> Has no signs of ageing, does what you&#x27;d expect. Be careful to not pull or twist both pieces or it will pull.  Ouch. :)</li>
    <li> The device worked as stated, easy to use, easy to clean. A very good investment for personal grooming and easily transportable.</li>
    <li> This product works very well, but read the instructions.  Twisting back and forth definitely works better (i.e. less painful) than twisting in the same direction.</li>
    <li> I just got this a couple of days ago, so I cannot attest to how it will hold up over time, but I can honestly say that when I took it out of the package I felt like I was holding some really substantial that would last a really long time. I could tell that this product was really engineered to last a lifetime (or a least a long time), as its motto says. I got really great results with my first use, and I didn&#x27;t find it at all awkward to use--even with my larger than average hands.     I would definitely get this one if you want quality. Made is USA</li>
    <li> The folks at Groom Mate are top notch people. Even though I made the mistake of believing the trimmer was battery powered ( it is not) the Groom Mate company is giving me a full refund! Hats off to Mr Bellm and Groom Mate!</li>
    <li> The title basically says it all.  This manual nose hair trimmer is built extremely solidly (much more so than I would have expected), and trims hair quite well, if a bit slowly.    Yes, even the Groom Mate will pull hair a bit.  I was hoping for some sort of miracle based off of the other reviews, but it will pull hair from time to time.  Given the nature of the beast, this is probably inescapable.    Clean-up and storage is a snap.  This trimmer is quite small and will fit basically anywhere.</li>
    <li> Ok, so it&#x27;s not as great as listed in \\&quot;Product Features\\&quot; because it did pull *one* nose hair the first time I used it.    However, I still give it a five start rating because it works just amazingly well. It&#x27;s easy, fast, and (mostly) painless to use. It&#x27;s a little bit of a pain to clean hair and other stuff from the center, but one end of some tweezers will knock things loose.     I feel I&#x27;ve gotten my money&#x27;s worth, and that&#x27;s always a great feeling when you&#x27;ve taken a risk on something making high claims on the Internet.</li>
    <li> This product is very durable and works very well.  I know my husband will be using it for years.  My only criticism is that it has a lousy plastic case that it came in--its a tube with a plastic lid.  This is a small product and I am concerned that it will get lost somewhere.  A nice case or leather holder would make it easier to keep track of it and would preserve it better.  Other than that, it is terrific and a great value.</li>
    <li> Really cool design and superb engineered gadget,  but not better than scissors, I personally cant use it, but have never used a trimmer before.</li>
    <li> Put simply, this product was so terrible that I threw it out and bought a regular ole battery powered one. I just couldn&#x27;t get it to cut the hairs. Instead it would catch them and then pull them out. Ouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s just me, maybe I was using it wrong. Maybe I had a defective model. Maybe the product just doesn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t know and I no longer care to know.</li>
    <li> I love the item. It&#x27;s ease of use and performance is awesome! Easy to clean and stainless steel ( no rusting) Just a great invention...no pulling, very comfortable to use...I highly recommend it to all. Get rid of those nasty nose and ear hairs America!!!   Thank-You Groom-Mate!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product in mid-December 2008.  I read all of the reviews and had some concerns about the cutting length of this trimmer or if I&#x27;d have trouble operating a trimmer manually with two hands.  I too have owned a few battery operated trimmers that have either broken down after a while or developed dull blades, which led to painful pulling of nose hairs.  This trimmer is an absolute dream.  For me, I am able to get it to cut down to at least 1/8\\&quot;, which is more than close enough for nose hair.  I found it very easy to use.  It does take getting used to using two hands to operate the trimmer, but I was able to adjust to it right away.  As mentioned in the other reviews, I don&#x27;t think it is even possible to cut yourself with the trimmer.  The small size makes it very maneuverable so that you can get difficult to reach hair without having to worry about accidentally cutting yourself.  Great trimmer - I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Joe Kernen on CNBC recommended this item and it works great! It is made of platinum, so it won&#x27;t rust.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s rare you buy a product that holds up to it&#x27;s claims.  This one does!  All stainless steel so you don&#x27;t have to worry about any rust being in  the bathroom.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had one of these a few years ago and loved it so much that I carried&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it everywhere its that small , however its so small that I lost it and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;couldnt find it anywhere in the stores , only the battery operated ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bought a few of these and hated them all and kept asking around for this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and here it is on Amazon !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take my advice buy this and you will wont regret it !</li>
    <li> Right now you&#x27;re sitting there with long nose hairs thinking we&#x27;re all crazy. Maybe. But you still have wily nose hairs.  I randomly used the Sharper Image Turbo Groomer for years. It made me laugh like Dom DeLuise with a good battery and irate like Yosemite Sam when the battery was low. In fact, Sam&#x27;s mustache may be nose hair. Anyway, the Turbo Groomer was inconsistent, bulky and cheap. The Groom Mate Platinum XL is unbelievable. The machining and durability are outstanding: stainless steel and no batteries. It&#x27;s that good, really.</li>
    <li> I received my Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer early last week. On opening the package I was really pleased with the clearly apparent quality of this product. It is a rather simple idea, you just insert the trimmer in one&#x27;s nose or ear and turn the the end piece, this in turn activates the blades and does a fine job of trimming unsightly hairs. This product has a great tactile feel to it and it should last a lifetime. This product is made in the USA and isn&#x27;t it great to purchase something that&#x27;s not made in China now. I think that this product is a great example of good American craftsmanship, not of the usual, use a few times and throw away type, that we have had to become so used of. I would recommend it as far superior to most others I have seen on the market, which are mainly electrical and made in some Asian country, where price was the overriding factor and not quality. Finally, I think the producers of the Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer, are of the old school in that they offer friendly and efficient service together with a great quality product. It may &#x27;only be&#x27; a nose trimmer, but one can see, it is built and sold with pride.  Great job and highly recommended by this Aussie user.</li>
    <li> Picked this simple little tool up a few years back an have greatly enjoyed it. Simple to use with no ouch. But during a recent move it somehow got damaged and pulled like a crazy person, it wasn&#x27;t fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I go to the company website, tell them my story, and thanks to the lifetime warranty they tell me they are happy to send me a replacement. Just had to give some simple info and it was on its way. The customer rep even noted in the email that I shouldn&#x27;t throw my old one away but to save it, more specifically save the little screw that holds the two pieces together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that I would have to buy this again thanks to the warranty, I definitely would if I had too.</li>
    <li> Hurts too much! It works though.</li>
    <li> does only a fair job.  purchased a electric trimmer that does much better.</li>
    <li> I have bought several of the battery powered groomers.  They are so cheaply made ~ they don&#x27;t trim well, pull hair, use batteries, noisey, rust and break quickly.  This little tool works.  It&#x27;s solid metal, silent and small.  A quick twist and the grooming is complete. I&#x27;m so pleased with this trimmer, that I plan to buy one for each member of my family. A tried and true method of grooming.</li>
    <li> Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer  Excellent construction. Does a good job trimming nose hair, but would be better if it trimmed longer strands.</li>
    <li> I prefer a powered model but this is a lot smaller. It&#x27;s also weird to learn to use</li>
    <li> I take it on all my travels, needs to be oiled now but still works just needs elbow grease ;)</li>
    <li> This don&#x27;t need to even be on the market</li>
    <li> Does the trick, easily and cleanly. Easy to rinse. I use this about every month or so.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, it does catch on the hairs. I used to pluck my nose hairs, so I do not mind the pain so much. Just be aware that for males with coarse hair, this little thing will cause a wince or two. Honestly though, it&#x27;s a great backup if those batteries run out when you need to look well groomed. I highly recommend buying it for that reason.</li>
    <li> This trimmer was of amazingly high quality and it felt good in my hand. I really wanted to like it. But, it did not rotate as smoothly and easily as I would have liked, it was difficult to get in the ear and I don&#x27;t think it worked as well as it should have. I had to spend a lot of time trimming and had to repeat again the next day..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I liked it&#x27;s quality and it would probably be fine with someone else.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mean to be a baby, but this little contraption hurts! And not just sometimes. It hurts EVERY time I use it, no matter how gentle I try to be. It&#x27;s less nerve-wracking than using a small scissor as I had been, but not by much. It does a decent job, but I&#x27;m not exaggerating with &amp;#34;ouch!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> cut em off at the pass</li>
    <li> After reading all the negative reviews (it pulls, it hurts, etc.) I was a little apprehensive getting this.  I have only used it once, and I assume it will dull over time, but I had to look at the end to see the hairs to realize it was even working.  I didn&#x27;t feel a thing!</li>
    <li> Great buy. I love it.</li>
    <li> Not as good as recommended by a friend</li>
    <li> After a few cheap electric nose hair clippers that never worked right and broke  after one month, I decided to go old school. I found this on Amazon, saw the description of the materials it is made out of and eagerly purchased one. Great investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You insert in the hole and twist the bottom half back and forth once and the nose or ear hairs disappear. The blades are extremely sharp but you cannot touch them or hurt yourself - not even when inserting. The action is smooth and there is  no struggle at all when  you twist the shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to clean but designed so that you do not really have to. It is also portable due to its size. Just don&#x27;t drop it down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best nose and ear hair trimmer out there!</li>
    <li> Too hard to use.  Would not recommend it. Fingers get in the way.Need something electric as it would be easier to use.</li>
    <li> The groom mate platinum xl is okay, prefer battery operated nose and hair trimmer. The schick extreme3 disposable razors are perfect for me. A very good shave, the best. Also, I would like to Thank You for the $22.06 I believe it is on the Schick xtreme3&#x27;s, wasn&#x27;t expecting it at all. It&#x27;s always good to deal with an HONEST company. In the future, will be ordering something again. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH..</li>
    <li> I bought this for my elderly father, it is so easy for him to use and I like that it doesn&#x27;t need batteries. The quality is amazing, so solid, I know it will last for many years. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d almost given up on the notion of having a &amp;#34;well-groomed&amp;#34; nose, as funny as that sounds.  I was tired of being on a date and blowing my nose and finding out later when I looked in the mirror that half the evening I had whiskers descending from my nostrils.  The battery-powered trimmers made sense to me, but they never really got the job done.  There was always some nasty hair left over it could not get at despite repeated tries.  The Groom Mate mechanism offered something different, so I was anxious to see the results.  Utterly stupendous!  Easy to use!  Hair all gone!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  Now about my love life...</li>
    <li> Sturdily built, but doesn&#x27;t cut very close. The outer prongs are too thick, making a close cut impossible. I still need a scissors, and if I&#x27;m going to use that, what&#x27;s the point of this?</li>
    <li> Does not do what it says. It yanks your nose hair and hurts like hell. Try an electric Panasonic instead.</li>
    <li> when I opened the package, I thought I&#x27;d been scammed -- how could this rather peculiar looking device be effective at trimming nose and ear hair?  Wow, I&#x27;m now thinking this is the coolest well-made little device ever ... no batteries or electricity, just a real solid feel and very good at what it is designed for (takes a little getting used to, but not much) ....</li>
    <li> No need for batteries, short learning curve, easy to use. Have found battery operated trimmers dead on arrival after flight.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product, and use it daily. Ever since I received an automatic nose hair trimmer and hated it, I have used this one and have been pleased. There really is no reason to get a really nice fancy one to go into your nose - this one will take the hairs in front right off, and to clean it just run it under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that it does not come in a case of any kind, and I can&#x27;t get it to stand on it&#x27;s own. So it is pushed up with the toothpaste and what-not and frequently falls when I open the medicine cabinet. A small case would help with that.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these a few years ago based on the positive reviews here on Amazon. It didn&#x27;t trim closely enough to cut small hairs that stick out when smiling. It was useless, and it didn&#x27;t cross my mind to return a used nose-hair trimmer, so I threw it away.</li>
    <li> This thing works well but it&#x27;s tedious.  Having to constantly turn that knob gets old. Mine rolled off my computer desk and now the thing doesn&#x27;t turn as well. I think some of the blades are bend. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again simply because it is too tedious. I have to admit it does a good job though.</li>
    <li> Tossed this product. Rips nose hair out painfully.  Spend a few more bucks and get a powered device. Ouch man.</li>
    <li> Considering that the alternative is a battery powered trimmer which is quicker, easier, and more effective for less money, I can&#x27;t figure out why I bought this product.  It was slow, not super effective, and a bit gross to clean.  I&#x27;m much happier with my new battery powered trimmer. (I bought the Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/Dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer for around $13.00)</li>
    <li> Fair price, good product, I bought this model because it&#x27;s made in the United States of America.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not Chinese or Japanese or Korean Junk.</li>
    <li> I had an electric nose and ear hair hair trimmer and it was awful. I threw the electric one out and bought this. This actually works much better and there is much less to go wrong.</li>
    <li> Is quite painful and that it has been my experience that it pulls the hairs out of your nose instead of cutting them.</li>
    <li> Not so good , not worth it.</li>
    <li> The quality of this nose hair clippers makes it seem like an heirloom possession. I &#x27;ve dropped every battery one I &#x27;ve had and that was it. I have a feeling that this beauty will last!</li>
    <li> Works great.  So easy compared to the battery operated trimmers.</li>
    <li> Worked great initially. Then gradually lost it&#x27;s sharpness over a year of using it. Snags sometimes now. YEOWWWWW. I think the electric ones would be much quicker and easier.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what is wrong with the people that have an issue with this. It couldn&#x27;t be simpler to use, insert in your nose, hold the top steady with one hand and turn the bottom with the other. The blades are sharp and smooth. There is no pulling unless you can&#x27;t hold your hands still. A little difficult to clean but well worth it.</li>
    <li> Horrible item...can I say it again...Horrible...it&#x27;s a hand crank for noise hair trimmer...I typed my nose hair out by just turning it</li>
    <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve bought one sooner.  Would&#x27;ve saved me a lot of pain.</li>
    <li> This beats using tweezers any day. It does sometimes pull a hair rather than cut it. I think the trick is to make sure all the hairs are clipped before removing.</li>
    <li> Good old simplicity without any battery power. Doesn&#x27;t pull hairs and cuts nice and quick! I loved it so much I bought two more for gifts and while they got laughed at initially, they both then said this was the best and most useful gift they got. Easy to clean and carry around, I don&#x27;t know why anyone would use any other nose hair trimmer!</li>
    <li> VERY good solid product, sharp, works great, good for travel, easy to clean, very somple design, little to go wrong!!!</li>
    <li> Pro&#x27;s: well built, cool design, quality item&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: doesn&#x27;t cut hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand how this item has so many 5 star ratings.  I twist it and twist it, and it seems to get no hair at all.  Perhaps if I allowed my nose hair to grow into a thick forest it would work.  The blades seem completely nonexistent/ineffective.  Maybe men&#x27;s nose hair is vastly different than women&#x27;s, because from my experience - this awesomely designed little thing is of no use at all.</li>
    <li> This is simple and they work. High quality stainless and easy to use. Im annoyed I even need these but I do. getting old stinks.</li>
    <li> Works freaking awesome, even &amp;#34;chops up the bats in the cave.&amp;#34; Comes with a brush for easy cleaning and a lil tube holder to keep it from being exposed to the elements. Works well in AFG were dust and god knows what get stuck up your nose. No need for batteries. In the event of an Apocalypse I will stand out by not looking like a I got a tarantula living in my nose!</li>
    <li> This thing is great. Precise and painless. I&#x27;ve bought two now and love them. I would recommend this groomer to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> The unit is useful enough I suppose, but it isn&#x27;t a battery powered trimmer, makes it very difficult to actually trim anything without your hands moving around the whole time, which isn&#x27;t exactly advisable in your nose or ear.</li>
    <li> This is a top quality instrument. I now have no hairs growing out of my nose nor ears and I have no injuries either.</li>
    <li> Appears to be of quality manufacture with raiser sharp manual rotating blades.  I had seen this item many times over the course of years from various marketers and often wondered about its efficiency.  Now I know.  Works better than I had expected. Glad I bought this item.  It was well worth the purchase price.</li>
    <li> When my lady kept hinting that she wanted &amp;#34;platinum,&amp;#34; well--- I sure surprised her with this present.&lt;br /&gt;Just kidding. Anyway, the product speaks for itself, so I don&#x27;t need to.</li>
    <li> I like this so much that I bought a second.  One for home and one for my travel bag.  I&#x27;m actually surprised by the negative reviews I see here because this works so well for me.  This is one of those personal grooming things you really want to work well, and this tool does the job.  I was hesitant to get something without a motor.  After using it, I can tell you that it works great, quietly and efficiently.  No pulling or pain involved, though you do need enough coordination to be able to hold it on one hand and twist with the other ;-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 2 version here on Amazon, one comes with a carry case, the other doesn&#x27;t and the cost is slightly less.  For my travel bag I bought the one without a carry case since it&#x27;ll be in my bag.  They both come with a small brush and a plastic tube if you choose to store it in that. This version arrived in the plastic snaps shut display package, with the unit, in a plastic tube and the cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is small and really efficient.  I have a mustache and it really bugs me when a wild hair is tickling my nose, so I keep this hand to trim minor issues like that and I really appreciate how well this works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and pleased with the quality.  The size and function is optimal, any smaller could be difficult to use.  This is a quality unit, love it.</li>
    <li> You just can&#x27;t turn if fast enough to clip the hairs (nose, ear, etc) makes a nice paperweight though and that&#x27;s what i use it as</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to battery or electric trimmers but this works great....blades are very sharp and easy to clean....&lt;br /&gt;Try it......it&#x27;s not all that expensive!</li>
    <li> The Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose &amp; Hair trimmer is stainless steel, hefty and overall a nice piece of engineering. The stainless steel blades are quite sharp, I know because I nicked myself a few times when trimming ear hair. I&#x27;ve also experienced hair being pulled (quite painful) from the roots in both the nose when using the Groom Mate Platinum XL.&lt;br /&gt;The hair pulling of the Groom Mate may be a problem with my technique in turning/spinning the Groom Mate&#x27;s blades to a sufficiently fast speed to eliminate the hair pulling.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Groom Mate Platinum XL is a fine instrument and I feel will work considerably better with my use and familiarity with this tool.</li>
    <li> I like this much better then the couple electric units I&#x27;ve used in the past.  It is precisely machined, very sharp, and does a great job.</li>
    <li> Very hard to us and painful.  Not good for ears at all.  Get one with a battery.  You&#x27;ll thank me later.</li>
    <li> I was pleased to find that all the positive reviews were true.    One cool thing about it is that it pulls the hairs into the core of itself. Rarely have any itch causing left behinds.</li>
    <li> Look, I read the reviews the first time I was in the market for this kind of product and was sold on the Groom Mate. However, I&#x27;ve been disappointed with how it performed. Its cold to the touch and requires one to turn the bottom extremely fast else you feel a bit of pulling/pain while operating.  Eventually I went and bought the Panasonic (battery) and its night and day.  Sorry Groom Mate, I liked the idea of a non-battery groomer but it wasn&#x27;t working for me.</li>
    <li> Of course, once you get to the age where you need one of these, and have worn out a few of the Wal-Mart specials and are in the market for something that will last, you may not have much life left. This cutter is easy to use, won&#x27;t make you bleed, and has a good feel to it. I&#x27;m pretty sure I won&#x27;t need to buy another nose hair trimmer in my life time. It is a two-hander though, and isn&#x27;t really well suited for blind searching around in the ears, but for the nose it really works well.</li>
    <li> very well built - has a great feel to it.  I was not completely happy with the product.  It didn&#x27;t do a complete job for me.  Had to use a grooming scissors to complete the job.  I think I would prefer something that was electrical.</li>
    <li> Seriously, the Groom Mate trimmer is not at all like those cheap trimmers sold everywhere. This thing is made like a precision tool with heavy weight materials, a solid feel and very nice surface finishes. I almost want to attach it to my keyring, it&#x27;s that attractive. It also works well!  No need for batteries, this tool works great with a simple rotation of the barrel. I don&#x27;t know how Groom Mate makes these things for the money but, I&#x27;m glad they do and I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> The Groom Mate easily trims nose hairs that hang down from the nose.  I have pockets of nose hairs that the Groom Mate could not get to.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I give this product an excellent rating with one caveat -- it is what it is. You are going to occasionally pull a nose hair. If that makes you mad well... you&#x27;re human. But it&#x27;s no reason to dis a perfectly designed precision instrument made of top quality materials. Simple to use. It will last forever.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I read many, many reviews before buying a personal groomer for my husband&#x27;s birthday.  After considering various types I chose the Groom Mate Platinum XL.  It is working well for him so far.  He does not have any \\&quot;complaints\\&quot; and it is doing it&#x27;s job.  He is using it for both nose and ear hair and has not complained of any particular discomfort of pulling as some groomer reviews have described.  So far, this product is as advertised and is performing well.  We cannot speak to product life yet as it has only been a month of use but so far so good!  I would recommend this product especially at this price point.</li>
    <li> This product delivers exactly as I expected. I use them sparingly but when I do I do not have any issues. It&#x27;s manually operated but since I don&#x27;t use it too much that is not a hassle. It does a pretty good job of cutting when I do use it. My nose feels a little rough and the shorter hairs make me itch until they grow a little longer but that is to be expected. Good purchase.</li>
    <li> I had a similar gadget that finally \\&quot;wore out\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve been looking for the same for a long time. Forget the electric stuff. This is THE best nose/ear trimmer, period. (Better than any other type of product anyway.)</li>
    <li> This trimmer is great. No pulling hair, no cutting skin, cuts clean,easy to wash and store. Buy it.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is very well made, fit and finish are of quality. It is very sharp and can trim nose and ear hair very well.</li>
    <li> It  is horrible.  Manual hair trimmer.  3 hands are needed</li>
    <li> Very disappointed and unsatisfied with the product... not at all what I expected it to be !!</li>
    <li> What a trimmer. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality precision instrument, doubtful you will ever need to replace in your lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;Performs so well that you will be a little surprised by it. No nicking of nose or ears plus ear canal.&lt;br /&gt;Cuts as closely as any electric model I&#x27;ve ever purchased. This will be the last trimmer I think I will ever purchase.</li>
    <li> Does a better job than battery powered groomers and it is easy to maintain.</li>
    <li> Not so close as the reviews seem to say.  The panasonic is way closer.  This one does not require a battery and if there is an emergency trim, it is acceptable sort of but the bottom line is I would not buy it again and I do not use it.&lt;br /&gt;I have it, but I use the panasonic ER415SC for a much better trim</li>
    <li> This little gizmo is cool! No more batteries ever for me. It cuts with ease. No pulling or ripping! Awesome thing. I dont give five stars to anything and this gets one. And you cant beat the price vs. Other name brands... Quality built and im sure itll last a lifetime! Warranty unmatched to boot!</li>
    <li> I did get some good cutting but also some good pulling. My comb style trimmer is more comfortable for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer mostly because it&#x27;s battery-free, sharp and very simple. Worth it to never have to worry about a piece of junk trimmer getting clogged up or running out of batteries again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: There is a bit of a touch to operating this thing. It can TOTALLY LACERATE your face if you are completely stupid. That being said, it mostly just yanks a hair here or there if you don&#x27;t watch how you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a nose hair trimmer you can take with you to the grave, this is probably your guy.</li>
    <li> It seems to work fairly well, but time and again I&#x27;ll be pulling it out of my proboscis and I&#x27;ll get a hair painfully yanked. My guess is that it isn&#x27;t machined that well and hairs get pinched rather than cut.</li>
    <li> Ridiculous&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underperforming&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inadequate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insufficient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost useless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A joke&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pathetic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regrets&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid this product, do not purchase, stay clear, walk away fast and don&#x27;t look back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, buy something else !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the worst item that  AMAZON  has for sale!  Avoid at all costs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS SERIOUS.  NO BULL.  TRUST ME, I KNOW FROM REGRETTABLE EXPERIENCE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P. Bowman&lt;br /&gt;Glendale  California</li>
    <li> This gadget will last the rest of my life, that&#x27;s how solid it is.  It&#x27;s slow to operate, but five minutes every couple weeks?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its tiny size means less space and weight when traveling, especially when compared with the electric models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it can be a little painful; I imagine that&#x27;s true of all nose hair trimmers, however.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good if you spin it fast enough.  If you don&#x27;t, I can see how it would try to kill you.  My advice, don&#x27;t F around when you use this thing.  Go in for the kill and get out quick.</li>
    <li> Rips and pulls the hairs creating sores in your Nostril. It took me a while to realize what was happening. I thought the aching in my nose was due to a pimple or something. Turns out everytime I used the Groom mate it was creating open sore in my nostrils by pulling or plucking the hair instead to trimming it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money buy the automated gentle nose hair trimmers. This thing is not for Nose hairs.</li>
    <li> This thing is great! I went from an electric to this &amp; I&#x27;ll never go back. Was looking at the Dovo one like this, but it was muuuch more expensive than this one. According to some straight razor sites, the dovo one is actually the same one, but they put their name on it &amp; charge more.</li>
    <li> it is simple and  I like to use. I love it. It is stainlees steel and can be washed..Delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> It pulls on my nasal hairs even when I twirl it quickly. Ouch! I can do just as well with a small pair of scissors.</li>
    <li> Really works :)&lt;br /&gt;Simple and working well. Liked it so much got another one for my father :)&lt;br /&gt;Good purchase</li>
    <li> It takes a little getting used to but works well and has metal blades. It does pull slightly but no worse than others I have had especially if they were running out of batteries. I love that this is manual and metal blades</li>
    <li> I was surprised at first as to  how it worked.  I like that it can be maneuvered to get in closer. In fact, you have to be careful when in too close as you might cut yourself like I did. But I do like it for nose hair. Do not use it for the ears.</li>
    <li> Built to last a lifetime. Plastic storage tube is crap.Slow to use but does the job. Bought 2, 1 for home 1 for travel.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is well built and fairly easy to use.  It does not trim as.close as I thought it might, but it doesn&#x27;t cut your skin either. It does not pull hairs as others have mentioned and overall is a great tool without using batteries. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned - they cut without pulling; they remain sharp; they reach &amp;#34;hard to get to&amp;#34; places; and they never need batteries. I highly recommend...</li>
    <li> What a great idea! No batteries to change small and easy to use! Will fit in your pocket. No muss, no fuss&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful grooming tool, works great on the nose hairs. Easy to use, compact size, no need for batteries. Built well I&#x27;m sure it will last a long time. Does not pull the hairs, cuts smoothly.</li>
    <li> The Groom Mate Platinum XL is a fantastic nose hair trimmer.  Due to its simple mechanical design, solid metal build and lack of electronics, the device should last 20-30 years.    It&#x27;s unlikely the blades will dull unless your nose hairs are tungsten filaments.  I used it for over a week and found its operation intuitive and comfortable.  Prior to the Platinum XL, I was using scissors with rounded tips.  The Platinum XL is much better.    Two minor thoughts for improvement:  1.  Due to its cylindrical body, the Platinum XL rolls around.  Please add a bevel to its sides to prevent rolling.    2.  Not sure if you can bring this through carry-on in an airport.  It looks like a small metal weapon.</li>
    <li> This product is a true God send. For years if I had nose hairs I either did the the quick yank &amp; endure [The pain] or used a pair of nail clippers [Something picked up in Marine Bootcamp...lol]. Over the years I&#x27;ve tried many sub-standard electrical devices that proposed to solve the problem. The majority didn&#x27;t cut worth a damn and if they did cut well it meant certain injury to sensitve parts of my face.     I received the Groom Mate for my birthday and was thrilled. The beauty of the product is that it is manually operated with no plugins or chargers to deal with. The twisting motion needed to operate the device along with the blade design virtually ensures a safe, painless snip of those pesky overgrown nose hairs. It&#x27;s made of stainless steel and compact so I can travel anywhere with it.    I&#x27;m so impressed with the product I started giving it out as a small gift (Christmas, Birthday,etc...) to all my male friends and relatives.</li>
    <li> Seems to be made from excellent steel, but not the easiest thing to use.  Will probably last forever, but using two hands to operate it makes it kind of cumbersome.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most solidly built products I&#x27;ve purchased in years.  It feels like it is carved out of a solid piece of steel and it appears it will last several lifetimes.  However, I find it slightly awkward to use compared to a battery operated trimmer and it will pull a hair if you do not hold the upper half still during use.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to comment on the product, but I have to give them credit for customer service. My groom mate worked at first. Maybe I used it twice. Then one day when I tried to use it, it was locked up. Nothing moved. I e-mailed the company on Jan 17, got a response on Jan 18, and today Jan 26 I got a new one in the mail. I was sure they were going to make me mail back the defective product and I wasn&#x27;t looking forward to packaging it up, going to the post office, paying postage, waiting. I was also sure they were going to balk at mailing it to Canada. But no, they just mailed me a new one, no questions asked.</li>
    <li> The product is as good as the reviews suggest. No battery to worry about. Sturdy construction. Easy to use. Highly recommended for nasal hair.</li>
    <li> After lots of review skimming I decided to order this when I was also getting into wet shaving, as I had never been satisfied with any cheap electric trimmer I had used, and scissors/tweezers are not the safest/most painless way to go.  I&#x27;m very glad I did.  It is such a simple, well-built unit and I have no doubt it will last forever, which makes it an outstanding value. I personally don&#x27;t mind paying a little more for quality, as it tends to last in the long run.  The company has a lifetime return/satisfaction policy, which is rare these days.    Basically, if you&#x27;re a guy, and care anything about your appearance, you will at some point want to keep those pesky nose hairs in check (I hope??), and this is the perfect way to do it.  Hold it with one hand and twist back and forth with the fingers of your other, while going around the inside of your nose. That simple. I experienced absolutely no pulling or snagging whatsoever.  Great piece of kit, would recommend to anyone not happy with their current grooming item(s)!</li>
    <li> How simple can it be?  Stick it up your nose and twist the base.  It actually works.  What have I been missing all of these years?  All of these expensive AA battery powered electric nose hair trimmers substituted speed for a decent blade.  The blade here is thick and it just slices all of the hairs without pulilng.  All electric ones spin cheap thin blades really fast.  They end up grabbing and yanking half the hairs.  I cannot believe how well this little battery-less wonder works.  I love the feel (solid little plug of metal), and it just works.  What else can you say?</li>
    <li> To much work, didn&#x27;t work as well as expected or read.  REcommend going with a battery powered version.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why anyone would want to use a product that requires two hands and a great deal of twisting when motor operated units can reach any body parts with virtually no effort.</li>
    <li> Now in my 60s and the proud owner of a magnifying shaving mirror, there seems to be an increasing need for trimming and weed control in my nostrils. My dad used a tiny scissors with rounded blade tips. That looked too awkward and lethal for me, so when I chose a trimmer, I selected a cheapo battery powered device. Boy, was it a cheapo. It worked marginally well in a decreasingly effective sort of way. Eventually, I relegated it to the trash heap. On a whim, and after two hours of research, I ordered a Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer. The device arrived promptly and cost less than a tip in a nice restaurant. It was such a pleasant surprise to hold. The following are the exact words that will trot through your mind when you first use this well-crafted tool:  solid machined knurled stainless polished satin heat-treated honed tuned engineered quality and why did I wait so long.  Happy trimming.</li>
    <li> This truly is a fantastic trimmer.  It doesn&#x27;t cause any tugging feeling when it&#x27;s being used.  It has a nice weighty feel that screams quality and it is very easy to clean.  I feel confident that it would last several lifetimes.</li>
    <li> this nosehair trimmer is ok but i dont like how its hard to take apart and clean. i myself cant event take apart this nosehair trimmer</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews before I bought this.  The previous electric nose trimmer had self destructed and I was suspicious of buying another one.  But this was so super and the way it&#x27;s built I am sure it would last at least one lifetime.  The other reviews said it took a little while before you knew how to work it, but I didn&#x27;t have any break in period.  I was sold on it the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> In reading good reviews I bought this item.  I&#x27;ll say it&#x27;s good quality, but with the whole manual twist and turn I just spend way too much time trying to get hairs that are at an off angle. I am a couple of months practiced now and I just always have trouble with getting all nose hairs efficiently.  I am done with this product and I recommend passing for a panasonic er430x</li>
    <li> After putting up with a couple of battery-operated trimmers that pinched, pulled, or nicked, I finally found just what I&#x27;ve been looking for!  I just got this in the mail and just had to try it immediately.  I must say it works fantastically.  I didn&#x27;t even feel it when it was trimming, unlike the electric rubbish.  It&#x27;s extremely simple and easy to use and feels heavy in the hand and solidly built.  I definitely recommend this tool for anyone looking for a nose hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> Takes more time but that doesn&#x27;t matter (to me) because there is none of that vibration that makes it impossible to cut your nose hairs. The vibration is like torcher to me, I&#x27;d rather pull my nose hairs out. So far this thing is staying sharp. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Construction is very solid. It feels like it&#x27;s going to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The twisting motion took me a few minutes to get used to at first, but now I don&#x27;t think about it. It&#x27;s very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;It might take an extra 20-30 seconds to use vs and electric model, but it&#x27;s at least that much faster to clean, so it amounts to the same amount of time to use (for me).</li>
    <li> the guy said it ripped the hairs out of his nose...ouch!!!</li>
    <li> I will not get into graphic details but this thing works and is awesome. If you need it, it will work for you. CHeap, easy to clean, no electricity needed.</li>
    <li> These are great. I have a few, one at work, one in the car and one in my travel bag. They are small, light and always work!</li>
    <li> Keeps this old man from being a hairy nose old man.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s identical to one I had years ago, and that one performed well for years, until my young son ruined it.&lt;br /&gt;None of the electric trimmers perform nearly so well!</li>
    <li> Product is great for what it is. Works as intended. High quality, made in the USA......not China like everything else.</li>
    <li> I enjoy the feel of the trimmer and it certainly seems well made. Unfortunately it does yank the hairs frequently rather than cutting. That said, it still works very well. Cleaning it without taking it apart isn&#x27;t as easy as advertised, but that isn&#x27;t really a huge deal. Glad I bought this trimmer, it&#x27;s nice not having to worry about batteries.</li>
    <li> I have used many trimmers and this one is the best. Bar None. It seems that my nose (hairs) is extra sensitive and using an electric trimmer has been most unpleasant. I have had to resort to using ice before trimming. Crazy but true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Groom Mate I am able to easily keep my nose hairs at bay with very little effort (and discomfort!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have reported nose hair puling with this device. THis happens to me sometimes but this usually happens when I am rotating both ends of the device. Keep the part in your nose still and rotate the blade and you should be golden.</li>
    <li> The only thing you need to know about this thing is that it&#x27;s awesome.  It&#x27;s like an enema for your nose.</li>
    <li> So much safer than using sharp pointed scissors in the nose and ear.  It is very well made and one of its best features is it is quite and uses no batteries</li>
    <li> I purchased the Groom Mate because it was supposed to trim hairs gently and painlessly. The trimmer did cut some hairs but at times it feels as if it is pulling the hair out by the root. It is not a painless trimmer.</li>
    <li> never, ever used a nose trimmer.  read many reviews for several different products in variable price ranges.  decided on the groom mate platinum.  excellent choice!  very easy to use, extremely durable.  i did not struggle with anything about it.  highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Nothing much to say, I ordered it and it works fine for what it is designed to do, nothing exciting.</li>
    <li> This is a well made quality tool. Works as advertised, but will pull a hair every now and then. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> WAY WAY WAY better than any other on the market.  Other than cleaning it is 0....ZERO maintenance.  Wish I had ordered this years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a product like this to make shaving easier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous trimmers over the years. Even the ones that started OK didn&#x27;t last long before performance dropped off.  This is a great item.  Simple.  Works perfectly.  Fast, efficient, safe, and does a GREAT job.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Having tried many different styles of nose hair trimmers and always being disappointed by the results, I decided to give this little gem a try. It takes a little time getting used to it and it seems to work best if you use two hands and rotate the top and bottom, but it does a fantastic job. I have had no problems with tugging or grabbing of hair (maybe those who complain of this have inordinately long hair to contend with). The construction is of very good quality and the results are better than anything else, including nose hair scissors, that I have tried.</li>
    <li> I &#x27;ve used several battery powered units advertised on TV with little sucess.&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the a better option, I am completely satisfied with product</li>
    <li> perfect for travel and home who wants a huge electric nose trimmer this works great</li>
    <li> im happy with this product. no batteries,measy to clean as well as small but sturdy.</li>
    <li> Works ~ Not a big deal</li>
    <li> not sure what the hype is about.  this thing is small for big hands, a pain to use, and pulled hairs(ouch!)&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll stick to the electric trimmers</li>
    <li> I have this for a long time ago, just use only one time Ouch Ouch Ouch damn it. Use this one just like pulling out one by one Ouch Ouch.</li>
    <li> Really great product. The second it hits your hand you can tell it will last forever. You need seriously steady hands to avoid the occasional hair being pulled out.</li>
    <li> Love the heavy weight feel and ease of use.  Although it does require two hands, it trims nose hairs very effectively.  Sure you sometimes feel a pull on your hairs but no biggie.  A rinse under runner water is all it takes to clean it.  No doubt this thing is made to last.  I wonder if it will stay sharp enough to cut though.  We&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> I think the Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose and Ear hair Trimmer worked well until I dropped it. It apparently is not made of tempered steel, the tiny blades on the end got bent and it never worked right again.</li>
    <li> I really like this little trimmer.  Does a surprisingly good job and as it is manually operated you don&#x27;t have to worry about the battery status (which is important because with items like these they aren&#x27;t really thought about until needed).  It does a great job of cutting the hair but there are snags that will cause the eyes to water a little bit from that strange pain nose hairs can cause.    I really recommend this item.  Also good for travel due its small size and the lack of a battery.</li>
    <li> I asked for a nosehair trimmer for Christmas last year.  My mom read the reviews here and found them to mostly be positive so she decided to get this device.  I&#x27;m convinced that 95% of the posters here don&#x27;t use this device on a daily basis.  It is painful and inefficient.  Don&#x27;t buy!!!!  Mine went in the trash and I purchased a battery operated one instead.</li>
    <li> Simple and well-made, works very well.</li>
    <li> Bought for male in house and he says it is better than any other product he has used.  Excellent product and service!  Highly recommend both.</li>
    <li> Being a woman in my mid-50&#x27;s, I&#x27;m sprouting hair in the oddest places!  I tried the groom mate nose and ear hair trimmer; but unless you have a lot of very coarse and very long hair you want removed; this will not work.</li>
    <li> If your looking for a manual hair trimner, this is it.  It is far superior to the TrimIT Wing XL.  Yes, it is awkard to use because it requires both hands, but no pain.  Unlike the TrimIT Wing XL which pulls the hairs out and causes pain (Ouch!); the Platinum XL cuts the hairs just as close as a battery powered trimmer.</li>
    <li> Nose hair groomer works well</li>
    <li> Elegant functional design built to last. What else need be said?&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s that time of life where you&#x27;re starting to look like a wizard with nose hair taking over - this is what you need!</li>
    <li> Well built but does not really work very well. You need to really work at it to get the job done. The manual twisting (this is not an electric product) is awkward.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find better.  Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think you could find a better pair of clippers… Great quality, as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect?</li>
    <li> When I trim my ear hair, and I must say that, so far, having ear hair that needs trimming is THE most annoying thing about getting old, they work perfectly as advertised. Quick, clean, painless. Most of the time when I do my nose hairs it works well but at least once during every session it grabs a hair and will not let go. Turning the thing back and forth is no help at all. There is nothing to be done, but pull the hair out. Moderately painful and it does make one&#x27;s eyes water, but quickly over and nowhere near as bad as a stubbed toe. I wish they didn&#x27;t do it and most of the time I prefer to use my nose scissors, but not bad.</li>
    <li> After years of using either battery powered electric trimmers (mostly the ones with the cylindrical head and the spinning cutter inside) or the trimmer attachments of electric razors, I decided to try this after my last battery powered Wahl started to lose power.  I bought mine at an outside site (similar price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smaller than I thought it would be.  It&#x27;s surprisingly heavy (solid metal, I think).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it cuts very cleanly without tugging (I read in the instructions to twist the bottom half back and forth quickly to avoid tugging/pulling).  When pressed against my thumb, the tip doesn&#x27;t pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still getting used to using 2 hands to operate this, but it&#x27;s not as difficult as I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who has used a safety razor, this feels like the trimmer equivalent of a well designed safety razor compared with a plastic cartridge.  It&#x27;s a step up in quality and works quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that I&#x27;m writing a review on a trimmer says how useful this thing is.</li>
    <li> High quality stainless steel unit, well-made device - BUT - utterly dull and useless! Only purchase if you like beautifully made useless things.</li>
    <li> Compared to other electronic products, this trimmer makes the  best choice in terms of energy efficiency (no batteries)&lt;br /&gt;And materials (stainless steel)</li>
    <li> Does pull a little.  We are used to an electric trimmer so this takes a little getting used to.  But I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I have pretty long and thick nose hairs that cause tickling if not kept trimmed. I have had a few electric nose trimmers over the years. Those worked decent for awhile but of course didn&#x27;t cut as well as I had hoped and after 6 months to a year the motor would die for whatever reason cheap China made motors die. This trimmer is powered by you. Hold one section and twist the other. Very simple and fantastic design, so good that I&#x27;m not sure I will ever need to buy another nose trimmer. It is very small compared to electric nose trimmers so I think this would be great for travel, save room and weight in your bag. I&#x27;ve had it going on 2 years and I still use it every 1-2 weeks and haven&#x27;t had the 1st problem. Will buy again if I ever lose this one or need one for travel.</li>
    <li> Good quality and very timely delivery.</li>
    <li> Works well, no pinching, no batteries to worry about.</li>
    <li> Cuts the nose hair very well, but be careful not to cut your skin while doing it. Haven&#x27;t used it for the ear hair.</li>
    <li> STILL PREFER PANASONIC -- BATTERY POWERED -- but will be good for Jungle Trips.</li>
    <li> Pulls hair instead of cutting.</li>
    <li> Not as good as electric</li>
    <li> Works well. Great for a travel kit.</li>
    <li> When I say this thing is well-constructed, I mean SOLID. I would seriously consider using it to break the window of my car if I ever rolled into a lake or something. My great-grandkids will probably get it as a gift someday, which is kind of gross, but it illustrates my point nicely.</li>
    <li> Unless I am twisting it wrong, this clipper just pulls the hairs out.</li>
    <li> Had one and this is a replacement..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a replacement for one I had for years</li>
    <li> Looks good, looks like good quality, but does not work. Good thing its cheap.Threw it away. Piece of crap.</li>
    <li> Solid build, but yanks out hairs randomly and misses most other hairs. Thus unfortunately useless.</li>
    <li> I feel bad to have to say that I dislike this product because it really is well made.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s a pain in the butt to use. I have a battery operated Panasonic that rocks.</li>
    <li> Does what it does and does it very well.  And doesn&#x27;t require batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need to make sure you hold it steady and twist fairly quickly, or it may pull.</li>
    <li> Simple, very well made and easy to maintain.  I was sick of battery operated products breaking.  The Groom Mate should last forever.  Takes a bit more effort to operate, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and another motorized trimmer and the other reviews initially seem correct.  I can get a little closer with the motorized trimmer but I&#x27;m still a little bit timid using this trimmer as I don&#x27;t want to get the shock of pulling any hairs.  It does work well and I&#x27;m glad I got it.  It appears to have very solid construction and has a nice heft.  I really hope the company comes out with a nice container / accessories for it for traveling.</li>
    <li> Very well made and effective. Highly recommended. I had a few reservations at first because of&lt;br /&gt; the need to use 2 hands, but it is very easy to use. The others I have purchased in the past with batteries have not been very durable. This one is very  solid and should last forever</li>
    <li> Despite all the negative reviews I read, it works fine for me and meets my needs...</li>
    <li> Solid, well made and effective.</li>
    <li> had i realized it was manual and not battery operated i never would have gotten it</li>
    <li> The product simply didn&#x27;t work for me. Didn&#x27;t trim my nose hair well at all. BUT, the guy I spoke to refunded my money with no hassle and told me to keep the product as they would never resell it after use. So, maybe give it a try. A lot of other people seem like it.</li>
    <li> Finally, found a product that&#x27;s made in the USA and is very well built. Will surely use this for  a very long time. I have read the review to get the Platinum  XL, glad I did. NO pain at all.</li>
    <li> This is just the product I&#x27;ve been looking for my husband. The price of it out beats any where I&#x27;ve priced it.</li>
    <li> I hoped that this unit doesn&#x27;t rust. My unit rusted completely. I liked the device, but I hoped that it is more durable.</li>
    <li> Great product. Because the user can place the device before spinning the sheering mechanism, you won&#x27;t pull out stray nose hairs.  I&#x27;m more comfortable going after hairs higher up in my nose. Works much better than electric trimmers I&#x27;ve used.  Comes with a stiff brush that is great for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside: must use both hands.</li>
    <li> Well, it won&#x27;t fall apart (it may rust) as it is a metal made product (everything these days is plastic).  You have to turn the end to make the blades work, but if you are patient and hang in there, it will gradually cut the nose hairs.  I think it will outlive me, and it certainly is not going to wear out or get dull (nose hairs aren&#x27;t that tough).  It certainly is a lot better than the electric one I had before (at half the price).  It works and it won&#x27;t break, trust me.</li>
    <li> No batteries no cords no charging outstanding little trimmer. Real value for money, very sharp and easy to clean. The money I have spent on similar products I could have bought at least 10 of these.</li>
    <li> While it doesn&#x27;t trim quite as closely as my old Panasonic ER412 electric trimmer, this does the job, and appears to be built to last longer than the 2 years that the ER412 did. It is a bit awkward to use, but it is effective. I&#x27;m now waiting for a gas-powered version.</li>
    <li> Seems like a well made device. I have only used it twice but it funcitons well. Hope it stays sharp</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s well made, and doesn&#x27;t require batteries. It does take two hands and slight learning curve to use. I would reccomend it.</li>
    <li> Simple, with a solid, heavy-duty feel, this trimmer works better than the two battery-operated ones that I have used previously.  That it uses no batteries is a bonus in my book.  The only downside is that two hands are required for use, to provide the twisting motion.  A definite thumbs-up.</li>
    <li> I have had many electric nose trimmers in my life, but this is the best and so simple to use.  I am so glad I found it.  Being that it is stainless, I can see it lasting forever.</li>
    <li> I just received this as a replacement for a Panasonic battery powered unit and I&#x27;m very impressed. It&#x27;s beauty is in it&#x27;s simplicity yet it performs exceptionally well! Buy with confidence!!!</li>
    <li> Electric trimmers do a better quicker job, but I wouldn&#x27;t trade my Groom Mate trimmer in for one.  Electric ones always run out of batteries, can nick you, and often break.  This is very durable and works well once you get the hang of it.  It&#x27;s awkward in some locations of my nose (front top) but everyone&#x27;s nose is shaped differently.</li>
    <li> This unit is not powered.  You have to hold the main part in one hand and twist the base with the other.  If you have large hands and fingers, it will be impossible.  Then to try to see around your hand to look into your nose.    The principal of the rotary cutter is a very good idea and manufacturers of other trimmers would do well to adopt the same idea as it cuts very good and doesn&#x27;t pull hair.  If this unit was powered, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail today.. was a little worried based on all the reviews and thought maybe the company was hiring people to give it good reviews.  So far, I used it a few times.. absolutely no discomfort whatsoever... I hate shaving my nose hairs too. It hurts and makes me sneeze!  But this felt like nothing was even in my nose!  Will keep you posted if my mind changes, but so far this thing is a must for any person with a nose!    Mo</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the product.  It does a good job.  it doesn&#x27;t take much effort at all. The cutting edges does an effortless job of cutting nose hairs that you can hardly feel it work. It seems well made and should last a long time. I was happy decided to get this one.</li>
    <li> I really like the Groom Mate Platinum. It worked well plus you don&#x27;t need battery. It&#x27;s well made with a lifetime warranty.</li>
    <li> military (pre-1946) quality...a must have for good grooming...this should be added to the other types of nose-ear trimmers...you really need all three kinds for a perfect job....</li>
    <li> pulls the hairs as it cuts</li>
    <li> Pros:  compact, metallic instrument, excellent construction, removable blade, durable and feels good in the hand.  I suggest keeping the blister pack to keep the trimmer in storage when not in use and keeping the trimmer and brush together.  Hey, and NO BATTERIES!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:  NONE</li>
    <li> Not what I was hoping</li>
    <li> Item is sturdy and works as it should.  A very good buy.  Would recommend this item without hesitation.  Much better than any battery type device I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a couple of battery operated groomers for nose and ear hair. They were less reliable and much bulkier than the Groom Mate.  Now that I have the Groom Mate, I would not consider anything else.   I expect that it will last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> When I ordered, missed that it didn&#x27;t need batteries.  Wow, this works great.  Wonder about the reviews where they say it is a torture tool.  They must have tried to cut themselves.  This is easy to use, safe and does the job quickly.  Thinking about buying a backup, to have with travel kit.  Just got it today, but the quality seems very good.  I am even thinking about getting some of these for gifts.</li>
    <li> This is one of those gems that is effective and gives the impression it will last a long time like forever.  Perhaps if you&#x27;re a multi tasker, the fact that it takes two hands to operate might be a slight negative but really it only takes a minute or two.  I really like the idea of this being hand operated  in contrast to the cheap looking  battery units that will often break if you just look at them wrong.  I&#x27;ve gone through a few of the battery units and then tried using the bread trimmer popup end of my electric razor which I definitely don&#x27;t recommend.  The Platinum SL is a winner.  Most of the reviews are excellent but I noticed some of the lessor star rankings were from people put off by the two hand approach to trimming which is understandable.  It is a non-issue to me and I think you will like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I lost my Platinum SL trimmer in a recent move and decided to give the Panasonic unit a try.  One big advantage for travelers is that the SL is very small while the Panasonic unit is best left at home however I will give the Panasonic unit a slight edge in speed and maybe a closer shave.</li>
    <li> Yes I did. For me to be compelled to write a review for a nose hair trimmer of all things should be a testament to itself. But sorry to disappoint you, because my writing skills aren&#x27;t that great. My impression of the Groom Mate Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer upon use is like when you use a good pair of scissors. You know that sheering action? You know the feeling it makes in your hands? You know the sound it makes? This trimmer has it...This has it..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s tiny, doesn&#x27;t need batteries, and doesn&#x27;t yank.  And more importantly, it cuts nose hairs.  There&#x27;s not much more to be said about a nose hair trimmer.  I&#x27;d buy another one.</li>
    <li> Very &amp;#34;thorough&amp;#34; in its trimming capabilities😉</li>
    <li> GREAT trimmer, no pain... but it doesnt get very close so you may still have some nose hairs poking out.</li>
    <li> So simple and does exactly what you need it to do.  No need for another electric gadget where the motor will eventually die and waste batteries in the process.</li>
    <li> Solid device, well engineered that takes up no space when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;Love it won&#x27;t use any other device and I&#x27;m a stickler for well groomed nostrils.</li>
    <li> There are others who have said the same thing.  It works and is hefty and solid.  But, it also grabs hairs and sometimes refuses to get one.  You can&#x27;t just push it around until it gets it like a battery model.  It&#x27;s much slower and you have to be deliberate to avoid the painful grabs.  I&#x27;ll probably keep trying to find a decent battery model, but this will be a good backup for when they fail.  At least it&#x27;s reliable.</li>
    <li> WOW!! This thing is awesome. Super easy to use and clean. Stop wondering any buy it already. Enjoy.</li>
    <li> great trimmer.... well made.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s there to say.  You stick it in your nose, give it a twist or two, then forget about it for a couple weeks (for me, anyway).  It works -- no batteries, no use of a lot of storage space, nothing to wear out.</li>
    <li> It works,not as good as Klipette though.</li>
    <li> works as described thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this item for a gift. But I&#x27;msure there going to love this item.it was deliverwed ontime. Looks like it will work great.</li>
    <li> Does exactly as advertised. Don&#x27;t throw away your scissors or tweezers, but this helps a bunch.</li>
    <li> The clipper worked awesome for about a year and a half but the n it locked up. I sent an email to customer support about a warranty replace in January and didn&#x27;t hear back. When I posted my original review last week they immediately reached out to me and were extremely helpful in getting a replacement to me. So with the assumption the my initial january email just got lost in the shuffle I would recommend this product given that if it does break that will replace it for you.</li>
    <li> I like the simplicity of this and it is really solid construction, but did manage to cut myself. Call me clumsy, but a bit of skin on my earlobe somehow got between the tongs and when I rotated the blade I got nicked. I guess I need to be more careful, but I feel it might make for a better product if either the tongs were longer than the inner blade (instead of being flush with it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they used to come with little leather pouches that fit perfectly. However, this one came with no case at all. I am sure those cases added to the cost, but I feel like a case of some kind is really important for a device like this.</li>
    <li> Not sure what people were complaining about with the hair pulling. They must have jungles in their noses. This little device is a great way to manage that nose and ear hair, it&#x27;s painless (mostly), and doesn&#x27;t use batteries or electricity! Off the grid nose hair management at it&#x27;s finest!</li>
    <li> Pulls the hair out some times, but that just means it is the closest shave ever! The no batteries ever part makes up for it. Sweet!</li>
    <li> I love this thing. Just what the doctor ordered.  This marvelous little doo-dad, no bigger than a pencil stub, absolutely works wonders! When I couldn&#x27;t keep ahead of my nose and ear hair proliferation, and trimming with the round-tip scissors sometimes caused painful ingrown nose hairs, I realized that an instrument especially designed to cut the hairs well enough above the skin line to avoid the ingrown hair problem (which is very annoying, and also very painful) was definitely in order. Except when I looked in the medicine cabinet, there sat my battery-driven nose-hair trimmer, encrusted with a beautiful blue-green patina of battery corrosion. So I threw it in the trash, and immediately ordered this. I really looked forward to using this, because it was touted as not needing batteries of any kind, and was strictly mechanical. My experience with a cordless shaver caused me to order new cutting blades, when the real problem was just weak batteries. I had become convinced that the stubble on my neck and under my chin was too tough for a mere cordless shaver, when it finally dawned on me that the batteries just weren&#x27;t getting the job done.  But you don&#x27;t realize it with a battery-powered shaver, because they are being perpetually recharged.  You think the blades are dull, but the motor is actually just not turning fast enough. This is your first clue that the batteries won&#x27;t last forever.  But it doesn&#x27;t become immediately apparent that this is the problem:  You end up having to buy new blades before you figure it out. So I ordered a new corded electric shaver, and zipped right through my daily shave in virtually no time at all, and got a perfectly smooth, close shave, almost in an instant. Suddenly, the stubborn hairs on my neck and under my jaw were no longer any problem whatsoever. And, by the way:  The new electric shaver cost less than batteries alone would have cost for the cordless shaver. On top of which, on that particular shaver, the batteries weren&#x27;t simply plug-in replacement batteries; you actually had to have new batteries soldered in place - which meant that you had to find a dealer that would/could do it, and pay his price, whatever that might be. I hate batteries, anyway.  They&#x27;re a curse, and a source of endless frustration - not to mention being increasingly more expensive. Of course, we don&#x27;t really have much choice, do we?  If you&#x27;ve got a tool that uses batteries, no matter how much they cost, what are you going to do, not buy more batteries? I&#x27;ve gone through batteries on hedge trimmers, edgers, drills, lawnmowers, shavers, self-propelled golf carts, and now nose-hair trimmers, and I&#x27;m THROUGH WITH BATTERIES!  Guess what?  You can have a whole platoon of battery-powered tools, but without batteries, THEY ARE WORTHLESS! And there is no such thing as a universal battery, which will fit everything you&#x27;ve got that needs batteries. They are all different voltage, and all designed to fit only the specific tool they were made for, but not anything else.  Every tool has it&#x27;s own battery, designed to fit that particular tool. And of course, they all need the one, specifically designed battery for that particular application, and usually available only from the manufacturer of that particular product. Which means that whatever price they decide to charge you is the price you pay. But you do have an alternative.  Your alternative is to do without. Or, very often, they discontinue that model, which means that you may or may not be able to get batteries for it. Of course, they usually come up with a &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; model, which uses completely different batteries.  And by a strange coincidence, the new model is always more expensive. The question arises: If you can no longer get batteries to fit your old tool - no matter if the tool is still in excellent condition, what good is it? Oddly enough, you may still be able to find batteries for it, but you discover that they cost more than you originally paid for the tool! Being faced with this situation a few times, I have decided to exercise my alternative:  NO MORE BATTERIES! But with this little jewel, you won&#x27;t ever need any kind of battery, and you&#x27;ll get quick and easy nose and ear grooming, which leaves you feeling clean and neat, and with virtually no effort. How great is that? PS:  From some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read, I suspect that one problem may be that people are twisting the handle, rather than just turning or twirling it back and forth, as recommended in the instructions. Just holding the top part steady, and twisting the bottom part back and forth with the other hand, does the job beautifully. About a quarter-turn to the right and back to the left is all it takes. I was a little concerned with possibly having hairs pulled or yanked from my nose - which is so painful it brings tears to your eyes. But not to worry:  It&#x27;s even easier to work the handle back and forth than it is to twist it, and that works to perfection. I have gotten fantastic results - right from the get-go, and I do love it.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Trims my nose hair with ease!</li>
    <li> I really find this product useful! It does a great job cleaning out my nose hairs, and It is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Works! I never bought one before because it looks painful BUT I was wrong. The older I get the more I needed one, so I acquiesced. I was pleasantly surprised.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband. He loves it. I love it. No batteries. Just a super product. Works for ear hair too.</li>
    <li> Bought it for husband as a gift- it&#x27;s durable and manual so he has control over what gets trimmed.</li>
    <li> Low tech and works fine.</li>
    <li> Never really seen the need to have a nose hair trimmer that could double as a excellent piece of hardware, but this one fits the bill. I&#x27;ve only had to he&#x27;s it once, maybe that&#x27;s a good thing. I&#x27;d bet if you hooked a drill up to it you could use it as a tungsten rod sharpener. This is one beefy cleaner that I think will outlast cockroaches</li>
    <li> Solid, almost scary.  But it works great.</li>
    <li> Well as much as it is, trimming hair in the ears and nose is just a flipping&#x27; fact of life. So, I tried a few battery operated things and they all sucked. They were to loud or just didn&#x27;t do the job. So, here is something that works very well and don&#x27;t let the price scare you off. I don&#x27;t know what more to say than it works as advertised and it is incredibly durable.</li>
    <li> A word of advice. Put in a nostril turn back and forth WITHOUT MOVING IT AROUND. It does sometimes get a death grip on a nose hair. It will make you cry as you stand looking at your manly self in the mirror.</li>
    <li> Man ... this is THE guy&#x27;s toiletry item. Smooth, sharp, painless, high quality construction. Grandpa would be proud of you for getting this tool that keeps you nose from looking like a caveman. You wife/girlfriend will too. Be a big boy trim the nose bush, this is the only tool you need. Spend the $35 and stand tall. The baby looks like it will last a life-time.</li>
    <li> painless nose grooming at its finest.  and they are guaranteed for life.  i have since had these fall and break, one email and the guy sent me a new one.  great product, every guy should have one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had three of these over several years.  I initially got it in anticipation of extended international travel since it&#x27;s smaller and lighter than an electric trimmer, and I wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with batteries or electrical adapters.  As it turns out, it operates far smoother than any electric trimmers I&#x27;ve had, with no snagging or yanking of hairs.  After several years, it did dull and start to snag instead of cut hairs, and when I contacted customer service, they immediately sent out a new one for no cost.  Several years later, I seem to have lost it (the only disadvantage of it being so small), and ordered another.  Just as good as the previous two.</li>
    <li> Bought Three..One for me and both of my brothers. Three lifetimes covered!!</li>
    <li> It was not good and I had to send back for a refund and I never got the refund</li>
    <li> I just got it today and used it and it worked great. I read some of these reviews where people are spending up to 3 minutes to trim their hairs; I did both nostrils in less than a minute. Also, READ the back of the packaging carefully. I say this for if you watch the Youtube videos you will see people demonstrating it with rotating it one direction BUT the instruction says to go back and forth which is what I did and the results speak for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do agree with my experience when it comes to electric nose hair trimmers that Panasonic is the best; but for the money, quality, and the fact I don&#x27;t need to bother with batteries I will stick to this.</li>
    <li> I was tired of having to replace batteries in my other trimmer. This works great and is more compact. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut close enough. Takes a lot of work to get all the hairs cut you want. If you just want one at a time, it&#x27;s easier, but still nowhere near as easy with an electric</li>
    <li> Not applicable for one to use on ones own ear hair and not easy to use for nose hair.&lt;br /&gt;After failed attempt to use this devise I went out and purchased another that is battery operated.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with my second purchase.</li>
    <li> Really cool idea, and it does cut like it promises. You have to be very careful when removing the cutter from your nostril, as hair may catch in the cutter and just pull it out instead. Make sure to spin and remove at the same time. I learned that the hard way, and by learn, I mean, I do it all the time and it hurts. I had hoped that the device would just rinse clean with a decently high pressure faucet, but I find hair will stay in the cutter blades, due to the tight clearances needed to do the cutting. You end up having to take the item apart to clean it - which of course is easy, but needing a screw driver in my bathroom already loses a star in my mind. I&#x27;ve also noticed that the grip area on the casing has started to show small dots of rust. It seems isolated to the grip, but I can&#x27;t figure out why that would be. Anyhow, I would say that it ended up being a good travel idea, but not one for steady use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m baffled as to why this product has received so many favorable reviews. I found it extremely difficult to use, as it requires 2 hands. It also does a lousy job at clipping hairs, that is, unless you plan on spending an hour doing so. Although the battery operated models aren&#x27;t much better, anything would be better than this. This is one of the few products that I&#x27;ve ever purchased that was so bad, that I ended up throwing it in the garbage.</li>
    <li> The very best feature of my new Groom Mate is it&#x27;s not run by batteries: being entirely mechanical it won&#x27;t wear out.  It&#x27;s sleek shape is perfect for the function it performs and does it ever perform beautifully.  Easy to clean and store it can be taken anywhere I travel.  Good simple design is the hallmark of this essential grooming aid.</li>
    <li> The size of the HEAD is TOO small to work effeciently.  The overall quality of the devise is of good construction and material.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as one of his birthday gifts.  He loves it!  The price one was better than another one exactly the same that I saw in another store!</li>
    <li> Fast, easy, small and durable. I have tried various electric trimmers, but this works better and easily outlasts all electric options...</li>
    <li> This is my second one. I&#x27;ve had the first one for 5+ years and dropped it on tile floor.  It would&#x27;ve been fine if it didn&#x27;t fall on its cutting end.</li>
    <li> I bought and returned this product as it did not work!!!!</li>
    <li> The first time I used the trimmer it brought tears to my eyes since nose hairs were being pulled out rather than being cut.  Attempted to use trimmer a second time and the unit had some problem that hampered the unit from turning freely.  Save your money!!</li>
    <li> Small but quality construction.  It works great!</li>
    <li> Whenever I see a product that users say is the best nose/ear hair remover on the market, I am somewhat skeptical ... OK very skeptical since the unit isn&#x27;t even electric powered.    Well, how wrong I was. I like the manual method of guiding the cutting area with one hand and rotating the cutting portion with another hand. Makes for a very effective trimming of the entire area. and as far as performance, the Platinum XL is far superior to any other nose/ear trimmer that I have ever owned. It is built like a tank and should provide many years of outstanding performance.    Should mention that the folks at Groom Mate had this item delivered to my home in only four days from placing the order.</li>
    <li> I was excited about this product from all the reviews.  Unfortunately it just doesn&#x27;t work on my nose hairs.  Plus it hurts and pulls my hair.  Ouch!  Not sure why my experience is so different from other people.  I&#x27;m still searching for the best way to trim my nose hairs.  Haven&#x27;t found it yet...</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband and he loves it!  It truly does the job and actually works better than the electric one he carries in his case.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to try this nose hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> Not very effective. Does not get close enough.    Can not recommend this.  Best to get the electric  haircutter, or use regular tweezers.  Ouch, but will work  better.</li>
    <li> No, it&#x27;s not motorized but you know, it&#x27;s wonderful.  When you pick it up, you can feel the quality, it&#x27;s heavy and well made and I don&#x27;t foresee ever needing to replace it.  It&#x27;s worth every dime thus far!</li>
    <li> I was worried by all the reviews claiming that this device would yank hair out of your nose.  Ouch!  But that simply isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;ve experienced.  This is a very well made device.  It takes very little time to adjust to the two handed operation.  My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t get as close a cut as I could with some of the other battery powered trimmers, without some extra effort.  Overall this is a great product, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> man, be VERY CAREFUL when you order this piece of garbage... it is the worst product I have ever bought, it doesn&#x27;t work at all, and a real wast of money... I know realize amazon reviews can be manipulated very easily, and I will be much more careful in the future... STAY AWAY FROM THIS TRIMMER... buy an electric or battery powered panasonic, or other brand...</li>
    <li> Well made little Product. It does cut the hair and not pull it. Manual cutter so no battery. I prefer an electric one but this is a decent item and very small. Carry it in you pocket.</li>
    <li> I did not know that the trimmer was completely manual until I received it. It&#x27;s not very easy to hold the trimmer with one hand while turning it with the other!  The advertisement should indicate that this item is NOT battery opperated!</li>
    <li> This is far better then any electric clipper I have ever had, small, but sturdy feeling.  Very portable and you don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking it.</li>
    <li> Does a great job.worth the money..</li>
    <li> I ordered this trimmer for my boyfriend and just have to say, it is awesome! It is very easy to use and works great! Worth the money spent and received it within 2 days of ordering it. Love the product and would definitely buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> Certainly easy to use and no worry about replacing batteries.  I had been using tiny scissors and this is clearly less dangerous.  I wish the directions were more detailed so I knew I was using the device correctly.&lt;br /&gt;Simplistic design and should last a long time ... just maybe get dull.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be.   Although it is very well made and heavy, it doesn&#x27;t work very well at all, unless one could twist it at a high rate of speed.   Very manual.   Just not what I expected.</li>
    <li> Just great!&lt;br /&gt;And delivery is very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product have a high quality material. Easy to use, no batteries needed. Very small and easy to carry.</li>
    <li> I had purchased one of these trimmers a couple of years ago, and believe it or not one of my so called friends stoles them. So since they work so GREAT I had to get another one. If you purchase one of these you will truly love it. WORKS GREAT !!!!!!</li>
    <li> Not great could be better</li>
    <li> All that is needed to use this is some very small movements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers said it pulls hairs, but apparently that&#x27;s only if you twist the bottom half too far, I&#x27;ve only used it with brisk, very small twists and it trims very neatly without pulling anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a guy who hates nosehairs... This thing is a lifesaver... As plucking them out with tweezers or pliers can lead to infection.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Extremely well made and solid! Easy to use and clean. Should last forever.</li>
    <li> This thing is as solid as others have said.  Good purchase.  I&#x27;m still using my electric, but this makes a great travel trimmer.</li>
    <li> No batteries.  You can control the spinning very easily.  No cuts or nicks.  No scary noises in your ears or nose while working it.  Hubby loves it.  I love it because he loves it.  I&#x27;d order again, no reservations.</li>
    <li> does the job albiet slowly - can&#x27;t stand the tickling from electric stuff up my nose so I guess this is the best I can do - If only they could make one of these with a low speed, non tickling motor so you could get them little uglies one handed</li>
    <li> O.K., who takes time to review a nose trimmer?  Well, someone who has been struggling to trim nose hairs for 25 years with an inferior product that leaves his wife complaining about &amp;#34;nose spears&amp;#34; when she&#x27;s kissed!  This tool works beatifully - cuts quickly, easy to position, doesn&#x27;t pull the hair, and seems to be well made. Got nose hair?  Buy this product!  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  Jeff McQueen</li>
    <li> A very nice product. I love precision tolls and this is an excellent product. Sooooo much better than the cheap old electric device I had.</li>
    <li> I like the larger/longer size</li>
    <li> Solid tool for trimming nose hairs. If you keep it clean, it will stay sharp and keep you looking great. Yes you do have to manually turn the base to get the inner rotary blades to cut, but it is not difficult and it is very safe.</li>
    <li> Bit of a learning curve so I wouldn&#x27;t pull hairs out, ouch.  But now I have it down I will never go back.  Well constructed, made to last.</li>
    <li> The Groom Mat Platinum XL is very sturdy and doesn&#x27;t grab any nostril hairs. It seems like an item that will last a lifetime.  Nostril hairs don&#x27;t become uncomfortably pointy when trimmed using this product.</li>
    <li> A fantastic little device. I not only have more nose hair, but it has started to turn silver, like the rest of my hair making it really noticeable. I bought this particular trimmer because of the life time warranty and the fact that it does not need batteries. It does the job well and my wife has noticed the difference. I see where a few people have mentioned that it can pull hair. I think that as long as you make sure to rotate the base before moving to a new area, you won&#x27;t have that problem. I have used it for several months and find it is comfortable with very little practice needed. Works well on that pesky ear hair, also.</li>
    <li> Works great and easy of use. The blades are just sharp enough to trim unnecessary hair and i like this very much.</li>
    <li> I just got this over a week ago, so I have only used it twice so far. Both times it worked very well and did a lot better job than two electric ones (battery operated) that I have used before.      Tip:  Instead of just turning the base, I turn the upper part at the same time, in the opposite direction. I think doing this, which moves the slots around, allows more hairs to fall into those slots than would if you left the top stationary.</li>
    <li> It works fine but does not cut hair deeper. Its manual work and no battery involved so got to have some patience working with it.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works to some extent for me, but it is not as effective as a battery powered one that I bought some time ago.  It requires a little learning, and in the end is not necessarily much better than a small pair of scissors.</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the best products I ever bought on Amazon. It&#x27;s simple, smooth, safe, outstanding quality and made in the USA!!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> So far I have enjoyed this product and it has performed as promised. I like the fact that it is not battery powered and it is the only trimmer I have used that actually works! I highly endorse this product. This review is genuine and not hype. Made in America!!!!</li>
    <li> This is an exceptionally simple yet exceptionally well made trimmer. It cuts hair very well and I expect it to last for my entire life. Definitely recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband do do some man-scaping, he resisted but eventually tried it without telling me. How do I know? Because he doesn&#x27;t have hairs sticking out of his nose any more - EEEW!&lt;br /&gt;He likes this product because it&#x27;s small enough to fit in his overnight bag when he travels for work, and he really likes that it can be completely disassembled and cleaned. No battery-operated parts to break, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies - do you love your man? Want to feel attractd to him again, like you did when you were both younger?  Then buy him this, and you&#x27;ll be amazed!</li>
    <li> Well made and does not pull or tug tender nose hairs.  My husband has tried several other manufactures products and likes this one the best!</li>
    <li> Small, well made, works very well. Easy to clean and store, would definitely buy again but this one will last forever.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moXUMXRYJDUCA1]]Ok so this is solid heavy duty and does the job well.&lt;br /&gt;Fairly easy to open and clean with a toothbrush.  Dont forget to add a little oil when finished.&lt;br /&gt;Ive owned this since Jan/2009 and it still cuts as well as the day I go it.</li>
    <li> The blades seem as if they&#x27;ll stay sharp for a long time but bending the nose around to get what you want trimmed and holding this aparatus with both hands leaves me one hand shy. You need to hands to operate this tool. One to hold the tool and one to rotate the blade. That left me without a hand to manipulate my nose around to get all the hard to reach hairs. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again but feel that it&#x27;s probably a good tool if you can get past it&#x27;s cumbersome nature.</li>
    <li> Feels very solid, actually pretty easy to use, but it probably takes a little longer than my old battery nose hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he seems very satisfied with the results.  He&#x27;s had it for about 2 years now and it still seems to work just as well as when I first bought it.  Either he is being tough, or it doesn&#x27;t seem to pull... ;-)</li>
    <li> much better that battery operated trimmers</li>
    <li> I have owned one for a long time and had no trouble with it until I dropped it.  After dropping it, some of the metal parts on the tip got bent slightly inward, causing resistance when I turned it.  After dropping, it started pulling hairs consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you turn it you should feel no resistance.  My guess is that the people reporting pulled hairs have one that has been dropped or have had the metal parts somehow deformed at some point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a new one after dropping the old.  The new one functions perfectly.</li>
    <li> This nose trimmer is nicer than the battery operated ones because it does not require batteries and it is much smaller, but it still has similar flaws. The main flaw is that it still pulls hairs. It would be great to find a nose trimmer that did not do this, but that may not be possible or within my budget for items of this sort. I do not regret the purchase, but be aware that this product is not exempt of the annoying hair pulling flaw that many of these products carry.</li>
    <li> I HAVE AND STILL USE A 50 YEAR OLD &amp;#34;CLIPIT&amp;#34; BRAND.  I FEEL IT IS A MUCH MORE STERDY IMPLEMENT THAN THE GROOM MATE.</li>
    <li> Works very well! Simple to use and I haven&#x27;t had any problems w/pulling. As recommended, just keep twisting the bottom of it the whole time you have it inserted and you won&#x27;t accidentally end up making your eyes water. It&#x27;s size and tapered head give it good reach.</li>
    <li> This thing works even gets the areas that was impossible with the electric ones, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with the groom mate, easy to use and cleans up fast.</li>
    <li> I have had many nose hair trimmers over the years and I can say this is BY FAR the best ever! It reaches hair others don&#x27;t, requires no batteries and its small size is great! VERY easy to use.</li>
    <li> Good craftsmanship. Works great. Cuts hair cleanly - doesn&#x27;t pull. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The best darn nose hair trimmer goin. I have nose hair like a wire brush, and it will flat out stop a battery powered trimmer - but not thins guy! It&#x27;s so sharp it can cut through the toughest hair. And for your hard to get ear hair? This is the best! I can hear 3 db higher now that I got the ear-forest under control, and this baby is quiet too. It will also make quick work of those three weird hairs that stick up out of that ore on your cheek too.</li>
    <li> No PG&amp;E, really smooth operation, and rust free! It fits the orifices and cleans out the errant hairs. I had another type years ago, but this one is the king! No electric hair pulling on this one; get it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> Nice and sharp cutting mechanism. Only draw back is that it&#x27;s a manual back and forth motion to trim your hair.</li>
    <li> The only caution in using the trimmer is to make sure you are finished before you move your hand that holds the trimmer or your nose hair may be pinched.  Other than that, it works well.  No batteries needed.</li>
    <li> ...i thought this was going to be incredible, and would replace me using a small scissors in my nose, but alas, i still sometimes use the scissors just to avoid an eye-watering nose-hair-pull.</li>
    <li> used it once then it seam to freeze up. i oiled it took it apart and cleaned it, couldn&#x27;t fix it so i tossed it, i don&#x27;t know what i could have done to it but maybe it was my fault</li>
    <li> Oh, yeah.  Guys, get this and go to town.  Excellent and feels like a precision machine.  Note: IT&#x27;S MANUAL, no motor/batteries.  Kinda surprised me, but cuts the forest like clearcutting the Amazon!  Lifetime guarantee.</li>
    <li> My search for a battery-free trimmer finally ended when I discovered this metal trimmer which appeared to be exactly what I wanted. After one year of unsuccessful attempts to discover a technique to get it to cut the hairs rather that pull them out I finally decided to give up. It seems that it is not built with tight enough tolerances as the hair enters the outer gate and gets pull around the inner element rather than being cut, thus pulling the hair out. This is not an enjoyable experience. My search for a battery-free trimmer continues.</li>
    <li> My nose has never been cleaner. Glad this doesn&#x27;t use batteries!</li>
    <li> Using this product will give you the nostrils of a schoolboy. Excellent for swimmers, runners, and others looking for maximum aerodynamics. Avoid use on any other orifice.</li>
    <li> Nothing is more disgusting than nose or ear hairs that are long enough to sway with the wind.  This simple device will alleviate the problem.  Heavy duty construction and ease of use.  You must have two hands and some level of dexterity to operate</li>
    <li> But this thing is legit.  It works better than any battery powered trimmer I have tried in the past.  Best of all, it is made in the USA!</li>
    <li> Awesome if you&#x27;re uptight about using electricity or need them when it&#x27;s not available. Just ok otherwise. They tend to pinch you and pull hairs due to the two handed operation required. Good example of durable simplicity, not big on bells and whistles.</li>
    <li> Should up on time. Works well. Small and effective. Recomended for the price. Easy to clean.  It is a helpful tool.</li>
    <li> love it works well and dosent use batterys .like like like like like like like like like like like like like</li>
    <li> If I could have used it before I bought it, I would have tried to find something better.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a electric clipper that I like better.</li>
    <li> I bought these because the battery operated types just weren&#x27;t strong enough for my Kevlar nose hairs. (I&#x27;m assuming also that the older you get the gnarlier your ear and nose hairs get. At any rate, as a middle-aged guy I&#x27;m just sure my nose hairs are coarser and tougher than when I was younger.) These do the job but I do find myself having to be patient and not move the device much until I&#x27;m done cutting a small patch at a time, or I&#x27;ll definitely get some pulling.</li>
    <li> I have had lots of problems with other trimmers and am finally pleased with this one.&lt;br /&gt;4 more words required</li>
    <li> Definitely a two handed instrument.  It works as well as any nose trimmer I&#x27;ve had but doesn&#x27;t require batteries which is a good thing.  It takes a little getting used to it but once you&#x27;ve mastered it..you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> Yes, I find this to be what I consider to be expensive but it does the job in spades.  I&#x27;ve used it for several years.  One does need to be a bit careful in the beginning as they can nick themselves but once familiar with this tool, it does a crazy good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s heavy and hand powered.  One holds it with one hand and twists the butt end with the other.  It&#x27;s well made and will outlast any individual and well into many generations down the road.  A bit different feel if use to battery operated hair trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fairness, I love it, bought one for my son and he didn&#x27;t like it so there is a personal decision as to liking or not liking it.  I find it beats unsanitary battery operated, plastic units as this is all stainless steel and can be easily cleaned and sanitized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this unit very much, find it to be a bit expensive but the price does include delivery and I&#x27;ve not found an equivalent product in the local drug stores.  After years of use, this is the type of product I feel comfortable recommending and once one acclimates to it being hand powered, will use it for the rest of their lives and be happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good product!!!  Bought one more for my dad after 2 years of first purchases.  I know you have cheaper options like less than $10 with electric trimmers, but those are no guarantee quality for lifetime use. This product is very worth to buy, and i strongly recommend to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Works fine.  Manually operated by both hands.  I use it on nose hair and it does the job well, but is a little unweildy.  Requires use of both hands, so if you haev just one, this isn&#x27;t for you.  I also got the Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex and it works better or at least as well as this and only requires one hand.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Does a great job.  Although I have never used an electric or a battery operated one, I don&#x27;t see how it could be any better than this one.  And it is totally manual.  Don&#x27;t need an electrical outlet and you don&#x27;t need batteries.  Can&#x27;t beat it.  Great product!  P.S. I&#x27;m a woman;</li>
    <li> I really wanted to get a mechanical trimmer as opposed to an electric one.  I am not a Luddite but I thought it would be easier to have a trimmer in my shaving kit that didn&#x27;t require a battery. Overall it is well made.  You can tell the machining is precise and it has some weight too.  Very durable.  The problem is that it isn&#x27;t very effective for me.  The idea is to rotate the bottom which turns the blades.  I don&#x27;t believe that nose and ear hair can cooperate with this method. It takes a long time with several passes to make this work.  It is well made and the price seems right.  It is far from a ripoff, but I would look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This item has too many negative (one star) reviews where someone has rated the review as &#x27;zero&#x27; as \\&quot;helpful\\&quot; and one or &#x27;more&#x27; as \\&quot;not helpful\\&quot; to NOT be full of bogus reviews. Therefor, I will not return my purchase for refund,  but just consider it a lesson in caveat emptor.</li>
    <li> I was hopeing for a real tool to trim with. This trimmer is painful and is not worth the effort. I can recommend it to no one.</li>
    <li> works pretty well. still getting used to it. pulls hair a little until you figure it out. great for my travel bag!</li>
    <li> The trimmer seems to pull almost as many hairs as it cuts. You will have to insert the trimmer multiple times (3-4 per nostril) to catch all the hairs within the trimmer channels.</li>
    <li> This is a well made grooming tool.  I don&#x27;t think it will trim the hair as close as some of the electric trimmers but it is nice not to have to rely on batteries!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a small portable trimmer for travel and this is perfect. It can fit into a pocket and still does its job well. It might not be as fast as an electric unit, but works just as well</li>
    <li> Finally a nose hair trimmer that is easy to use and works, and is well made for a good price.</li>
    <li> I know this is a fairly well reviewed item. First off, the people who complain about pain should know that if you want the hair completely ripped out, you&#x27;re going to have pain, just like getting your eyebrows plucked, something make-up artists have done to me before TV shoots. It&#x27;s a little painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is okay for people who don&#x27;t mind a tiny stem of the hair sticking out from where it was detached. However, for me this trimmer doesn&#x27;t work as well as just ripping the hairs out manually. It&#x27;s good to have around if you&#x27;re running out the door and spot something that&#x27;s really overgrown and needs to be taken out, but I didn&#x27;t get a super-close result with it. It&#x27;s the type of thing that others may have a much different result with, depending on how you&#x27;re hair grows.</li>
    <li> I guess this is okay if you don&#x27;t want battery issues but I found it difficult to use and annoying</li>
    <li> As detailed by many others, this unit is impressively constructed and I can well imagine it lasting forever, but the bottom line, for me, was how well does it groom the inner sanctum of my nose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, not well enough.  It&#x27;s true I have very hirsute nostrils and it&#x27;s true this gets a lot of those hairs, but it leaves too many to make it a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a lot more bang for my buck with those imported battery-operated trimmers, even if they have the half life of a fruit fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps those with less hair and/or light colored hair (mine&#x27;s black as coal) will find satisfaction, but I was excited to buy this after all the many rave reviews, but when it comes to trimming my nose hairs, you need to go big or go home, and this trimmer has found a new home in my wife&#x27;s bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appreciate the effort, but it simply doesn&#x27;t do enough.  Not only does it fail to cut finer hairs, but no matter what you do, you cannot cut the hair close enough to the skin, leaving lots of unsightly nubs inside your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy the aforementioned battery-operated trimmers on that famous auction site, where you can pay $2-$3 each if you don&#x27;t mind the wait for shipping from China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck with your nose and ear hair issues, people.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time for a trimmer that works.  Have purchased many,  some never doing the deed even once.  This little guy is really made to last, my search is over.  MADE IN USA  thanks</li>
    <li> I hate when this things brake after 10 times... I don&#x27;t like plastic things that are made in the middle of nowhere. This is a proper old school product. It feels great. Looks great and its simple. That is what it needs to be durable, useful, and simple.</li>
    <li> This is the first nose hair trimmer that I have ever liked.  Every single one of the electric models I&#x27;ve tried seemed like they really weren&#x27;t doing anything besides making me feel like I needed to sneeze.  This manual trimmer is also very fast compared to the electric models.  It only takes a few twists, and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a bit over a year now to occasionally trim moderate nose hair, and I&#x27;m satisfied.  I use it only in the nose, as I don&#x27;t have protruding ear hair.  The construction is solid, it functions well, and is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operation is simple: put it in your nose, gently move it around while twisting the bottom half.  It trims the bulk well, but is rather difficult to target single hairs.  There&#x27;s been a few times where I had one stray hair that took a while to get.  I&#x27;ve only had it pull hairs a few times out of the many times I&#x27;ve used it.  I&#x27;ve never been cut or pinched by the mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean it by rinsing with rubbing alcohol, then twisting the head under running water.  The cut hairs come out easily, and it&#x27;s ready for use again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m highly satisfied with this product.  The price is good, it works well and is easy to use, it doesn&#x27;t use electricity, and is easy to pack for travel.</li>
    <li> To get to the point: As with everything I buy, I wanted a quality trimmer that would last. Somehow I missed the fact that this is a manually spun trimmer. Even so, I&#x27;ve had it now for a few years and wish to share the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is very well built.&lt;br /&gt;2. It will \\&quot;bite\\&quot; you unless you follow the technique I describe below.&lt;br /&gt;3. It will indeed last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;4. I wish it WERE electric&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself from pain with this key point. Once you insert the device, do NOT move it around unless you are already spinning the blades. AND, when you stop spinning the blades, you had better be holding still. Vary from this approach and you will become fully aware of your humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;Roger</li>
    <li> At home it requires dexterity and work so not particularly fond of it, but traveling it will be good as no batteries are needed.</li>
    <li> Trimming ear and nose hair is far from an enjoyable grooming task. That said, this makes it go much quicker. Operation is a simple as can be, and clean up involves little more than a soak in some rubbing alcohol.</li>
    <li> Works surprisingly well. Does not need to be turned in a circle but rather back and forth in short strokes. Be cautious to keep it moving the entire time it is in your nose so it does not pull.</li>
    <li> All it did was grab my nose hair and pull them out, the end with the blades were sharp and cut the inside of my nose.  This really hurt for several days.</li>
    <li> Great product and good customer service. I have always liked this brand and continue to buy it. Will do business gain...</li>
    <li> Used for a couple of years, but never was satisfied with final results.  So went and purchased a Panasonic unit and getting the results that was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this Groom Mate will be great when the power grid goes down and I start shaving with my pocket knife.  But until then will go with powered units.</li>
    <li> The Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer works very well and is compact, easy to use, easy to clean, and doesn&#x27;t need batteries.</li>
    <li> There seems to be a lot of discussion about phoney reviews on this product.  I have never reviewed anything on the Amazon site before.  I am not a company employee.  In 2007 I took an assignment for thirty months in a small area of Romania, not knowing if I would be in a tiny village without access to batteries.  Turned out that Romania is a fully modern country and I could have brought my Panasonic.  I purchased one of these nose hair trimmers at WalMart and was pretty dubious.  I grow copious nose hair and have been using this quality tool for five years.  It does not pull my hair as much as the Panasonic, is still sharp after five years, and is no longer available in the local WalMart.  I was tickled pink to find that it still existed on Amazon and am buying a second one for use in my office.  This is a solid and quality product, made in the USA, and well worth the 30 bucks.  When I bought my first one, I was unaware of the warranty; what a bonus!</li>
    <li> My Groom Mate trimmer isn&#x27;t even very old.  It does not move or twist smoothly, constantly sticks when twisting and pulls hairs out of my nose.  I&#x27;ve taken it apart three times to make sure it was clean and couldn&#x27;t find any reason for it to stick when twisting.  It simply doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.  Select another product.</li>
    <li> Happily received my groom mate platinum XL, boy does this thing work great! it&#x27;s very well made,think it will last me a lifetime. very simple to use, easy to clean.wish I would have bought one years ago. If you are thinking of buying one do yourself the favor and go ahead it&#x27;s well worth it!!</li>
    <li> No battery, but not easy to use! Your wife or girl/boyfriend will have to help!&lt;br /&gt;Would have / should have bought electric!</li>
    <li> Very good product, good quality, easy to use, easy to clean up; and it is made in USA!!!. No more cuts inside your nostrills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carlos from Garner, NC</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product! I was actually expecting a battery operated one to arrive in the mail, so I was a little dubious about this one when I first got it. It works great though, and I appreciate how easy it is to clean it.  It&#x27;s also an environmental plus since batteries are toxic to the environment. It works well, as long as you remember not to move it around in your nose without turning it completely. It cuts well; but if you turn a little and then move it, it may pull out a nose hair. Just be sure to give it a complete turn before moving it, and everything is fine.</li>
    <li> This is a must for any man. Easy to use and no pulling of nose hair. Simply insert into nose and turn bottom back and forth. Cuts smoothly without pulling or causing pain.</li>
    <li> After two, no make that three, failed electric timmers I finally pulled the plug and ordered the Groom Mate Plantinum XL Nose &amp; Ear Trimmer.  It&#x27;s easy to clean.  It takes up very little space.  There are no batteries to go dead.  There are no electronics to fail.  It&#x27;s built with great precision and is very solid.  It works well and I don&#x27;t ever have to worry again about batteries dying or electronics failing!  And it&#x27;s made in the U.S.A.!</li>
    <li> Great quality. Works well. Turn the handle and it won&#x27;t pull your hairs. Also, the company stands behind it. I called when mine got a bit rough to turn and they replaced it without any hassle. Best nose hair trimmer I have used. And it works for ears and eyebrows in a pinch.</li>
    <li> I seemed to have reached an age where hair is growing out of my nose at a very accelerated rate. I tried many different nose hair trimmers such as the Panasonic battery powered one that has a tendency to rip out your nose hairs once in a while. I decided to try a manually operated one to prevent tear inducing torture caused by some of the powered trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a few tries to get the hang of this trimmer. It works well if you methodically point it in to an area that needs trimming and turn the handle slowly. You just have to be careful when removing the trimmer out of your nose so hair isn&#x27;t caught by the blade. I like this item so much I got one for my father since the apple doesn&#x27;t fall far from the tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is top notch and is a hefty chunk of stainless steel. I would recommend to anyone with nose hair issues.</li>
    <li> After I received the trimmer, I used it and was surprised by how well it works and how well it is made! Quality is number 1 on my list! It&#x27;s great to know that you are buying a quality product made in the USA! I always read the comments on each item before I buy,so,this was a given.Buy this and forget about batteries and wasted money for cheap made products!  Jeff</li>
    <li> Seems to pull hairs a little if you don&#x27;t have a real steady hand. That being said it does clean hairs out of my ears and nose much better than a scissors. Construction is good, it should last a lifetime.</li>
    <li> Having poked my nose with a manicure scissors for years, I appreciate the safety of this trimmer. Expensive, but one solid chunk of steel.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about this, it works well as designed.&lt;br /&gt;No nasty pulls in my case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bear in mind that it doesn&#x27;t defy the laws of physics:&lt;br /&gt;If you stick it in your nose, make sure you keep it turning or it may catch and pull a hair!</li>
    <li> This is a really neat invention.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice, but I am pleased that I no longer have to yank hairs out of my nose with tweezers.  This unit is very cleverly designed, compact and works well.  It is American made and quality is displayed throughout in its design and construction.  This is absolutely the opposite of most of the junk that comes from China and other places where cheapness is the standard.</li>
    <li> Bad choice for grooming</li>
    <li> I stuck it in my nose and started twisting. I heard and felt nothing. I thought I&#x27;d just been ripped off until I pulled it out and looked at it. It was full of hair! Its extremely well designed and cuts very easily. Cleaning was easy. I&#x27;ll never buy battery powered again</li>
    <li> Easy to use - however, it is awkward to twist without pulling the nasal hairs</li>
    <li> No more nose hair. I read a review with someone saying it pulled their nose hair and wouldn&#x27;t let go. I laughed so hard. You can&#x27;t spin it like a pussy. You have to turn it back and forth while moving it through your nose hair and it will shred them. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Very well made tool that will probably last forever, however its difficult to avoid pulling hairs from the nose due to the manual operation. I do not use the one I purchased, instead I bought a battery operated nose &amp; ear trimmer that is much easier to use. I would not recommend this trimmer to anyone!  The five stars are for the quality of the tool only!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and clean.  Wish it cut a little closer</li>
    <li> This hair nose groomer removes unsightly hair from my nose.. I take pride in my personal appearance.</li>
    <li> This trimmer worked fine.  Had to be a careful to never stop twisting while moving it around inside your nose otherwise it&#x27;d yank the hairs.  A few times doing that and one learns not to do it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it for many years until one day I dropped it in the sink.  This trimmer is a solid chunk of steel and it landed on the cutting fingers.  A couple of blades got bent very slightly but that was enough for the trimmer to not rotate anymore.  I tried very carefully to unbend the outer finger but was not able to get it back in the exact correct position.  Any gap between the outer fingers and inner cutting shaft and it&#x27;s like taking tweezers to every single hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m moving on to something powered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also been stopped a couple of times at airport X-ray for a secondary inspection of my carry-on luggage.  A chunk of solid steel with a unfamiliar shape invites security to take a second look.</li>
    <li> pulls the hair out about half the time; I have used ones that are better and not as heavy as this</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to get one of these for years and have finally done so. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m looking in to purchasing an additional trimmer that is electric.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a bit of getting used to being that it takes two hands to operate.</li>
    <li> Worked well for years.  I bought it in 2008.  It now no longer turns, and isn&#x27;t sharp.  It&#x27;s a great product when it works.  For the price I paid, and the presumed build quality, I expected it to last longer than 6 years.  But, maybe that&#x27;s an unrealistic expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 3 stars (but it&#x27;s a 5 star product for at least a few years.)</li>
    <li> Works really razor sharp...and VERY WELL CRAFTED! I use for my nose and ears. Works best in the nose but not bad in the ears.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Total garbage.</li>
    <li> expensive, indestructable, heavy and large, works well. guaranteed for life?</li>
    <li> Only used a few times so far, but wow, this is great!  I&#x27;ve used a number of electric trimmers in the past, and always ended with watery eyes from the hairs pulled out.  This is great, no battery to charge, nothing to plug in, just twist a few times and done.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Hard to use&lt;br /&gt;  Pulls hair&lt;br /&gt;  Requires the use of both hands&lt;br /&gt;  Uncomfortable to use&lt;br /&gt;  Does not measure up to battery operated devices&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall : Purchasing this item was a waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> it cuts your nose hairs just as advertised</li>
    <li> While this works fine, I would use it as a back up. The battery operated are so much better. For sure.</li>
    <li> With so many glowing reviews on Amazon and other sites, I had to try this hair trimmer.  At first, it lived up to the hype -- simple to use, smooth, no batteries needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few months, though, the inside piece started to catch on the outside piece.  It got to the point where I could barely turn it.  i thought that maybe I had treated it poorly (dropped it or maybe I wasn&#x27;t supposed to wash it with water), so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and ordered another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time, it only took a month for the same problem to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I emailed the company about two defective hair trimmers.  Their response: \\&quot;We manufacture the Platinum XL trimmer to a very tight tolerance in terms of the inner rotary blade and outer shaft and if there is just a slight variance this could cause the skip or binding that you are describing.  We have actually just introduced a brand new Groom Mate trimmer that we are calling the Platinum XL Professional... If you are interested, we would be more than happy to provide you with one of these new trimmers.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited that they were honoring their lifetime guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks later, I hadn&#x27;t received anything or heard anything, so I emailed them again.  No response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One month later, still nothing, so I emailed again.  No response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nine months later, I just ended up throwing them away, and I posted a negative review on Amazon.  The negative review got the attention of the company; they contacted me, apologized for not responding to either of my emails, and promptly sent me one of their new models.  I am trying it out now, and will update this review if there aren&#x27;t any further issues after a few months of use.</li>
    <li> Works well, simple design, doesn&#x27;t snag or pull. Easy to use, clean. Nothing else on the market works as well.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know this unit was self powered. It&#x27;s hard to hold the little unit and turn the blades while trimming you ear hair. Bad buy.</li>
    <li> This nose hair trimmer works just as advertised, is easy to clean, stays sharp forever, and is compact for travel.</li>
    <li> A great product and easy to use and clean with the included brush.</li>
    <li> I will concede that perhaps i am not using this just right but I find that it still pulls hairs more than using (hair trimming) scissors but then again it makes up for this little caveat via convenience, plus it is very solidly built and will probably last forever so for the price its an ok buy.</li>
    <li> It is a nice looking trimmer. Mine was not perfect in mfr. A bit stiff to use, what do you expect at that price, but manually powered it needs to be free moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy a battery powered one.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical when I realized this had no motor but was used manually.  Based on good reviews here I took a chance and am glad I did.  This sucker really does the job of cutting that unwanted nose and ear hair quickly and easily.</li>
    <li> My husband had purchased an expensive mechanical trimmer, and hated how it pinched and pulled when he trimmed his nose hairs.  When he bought this, I had no idea what it was.  When I asked he showed me how to use it and it works SO well!!  I have tried it so that I too can attest but it doesn&#x27;t pull or tug at all when you use it correctly.  And it is faster and less messy than the previous expensive one we had.  GREAT purchase!</li>
    <li> I was a bit unsure about this item but I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I am glad I did.  This product seems well made.  I think one of the coolest things about it is that it requires no batteries.  I am a gadget person and I own so many gadget that require charge cords or batteries and it is great to have a new one that needs neither.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE****  I had my groom mate in my travel toiletry bag and I guess it was banged around and would not work any longer.  BUT, the good news is when I contacted the company they asked for my address and sent me out a brand new one very quickly and also sent me a little leather pouch to keep it protected.  Good company! and good product.</li>
    <li> You have to use both hands, which doesn&#x27;t seem like a big deal unless you&#x27;re positioning with one hand and aiming to cut certain hairs, then you have to let go of your nose and use both hands on the friggin clipper - and it doesn&#x27;t cut the hair that well. But it looks cool... BFD. I have a battery powered one by Panasonic that is much better and easier to use.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, far superior to all the various battery-operated models I have tried, of which the small Panasonic is the best.  Switching to this one was like going from a Mazda to BMW.  Not only does it feel better -- it cuts closer and more precisely.[[ASIN:B000EBFJXS Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer w/Lifetime Warranty]]</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and I never have to dig for batteries again. What a great idea.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is great. Works as promised. Painless. Very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Afger years of using electric trimmers with mixed results, it took some time to get used to the radically different way a manual powered trimmer works.  But well worth the effort.  A clean look with no batteries, motors, etc. to worry about.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is easy to clean and trims but it has difficulty trimming close in the nose and this leaves me with some nose hairs a bit too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction is very solid.</li>
    <li> http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EBFJXS/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title    Performs as stated.  A very nice product and the service was great.</li>
    <li> What a piece of junk. This thing cuts you, pulls your hairs, doesn&#x27;t get a close cut, and requires both hands to use, which makes it awkward and inaccurate. After a few uses, the metal pieces stick a bit, making it even harder to use and easier to hurt yourself. There is absolutely nothing to recommend this product, and I seriously ask you to consider MUCH better alternatives, like a Panasonic electric trimmer. Yes, they&#x27;ve changed their shape for safety reasons, but so has the Garbage Mate, and unlike the GM, they are easy to use, painless, fast, accurate, and give a close trim.</li>
    <li> Feels very sturdy. Comes with protective plastic sleeve.  Perfect addition to my travel kit.  Tried it both for nose and ear.  Never tried an electric one, but I travel a lot, and I did not consider an electric one.  I know the battery would be dead when I really needed it.</li>
    <li> Well made stainless steel nose/ear hair trimmer that does not use batteries. All of this is true, and the price is less than half of the same one advertised in Herrington&#x27;s catalog. However, if one does not keep the positioning perfectly still while twisting the bottom, which rotates the cutting blades, it tends to pull, rather than cut nose hairs. OUCH!!</li>
    <li> I first purchased one about 5 years ago and it was excellent. It did a great job with no pain or hair pulling. Unfortunately I lost that one and recently ordered a new one. However this one is terrible. It pulls hair out and is so painful. I don&#x27;t know if this is a defective one or not but I cannot use this. It doesn&#x27;t cut the hair but grabs them and yank them out which is extremely painful.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was manually operated (no batteries) by twisting the bottom part back and forth. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s what causes the issue, but this thing painfully pulls my nose hair rather than cutting it cleanly.</li>
    <li> Literally tears individual hairs from each nostril. Can&#x27;t stop my eyes from tearing up, SO PAINFUL! There must be a better way than this.</li>
    <li> I bought one several years ago from Amazon and it&#x27;s works very well. The system works by twisting the base to make the cutters.  A little odd feeling, but with a bit of practice, it cuts very well.</li>
    <li> Great product, very well made. A joy to use</li>
    <li> You need to have four arms &amp; hands and you need to be double jointed to be able to use this device.  Or ask your wife to do it for you.</li>
    <li> I have had a few of these nosehair trimmers... but this one is the best! ... at first I was leary when I opened it up, and realized no battery powered type of trimmer.  But its Made in the USA!!.. Yay! The instruction tell you to insert the cylinder into your nostril.. hold steady.. and twist the bottom cylinder of the trimmer.... I could not tell at first if it was working until I took it out of my nose, and used the cleaning brush ( that comes with it) .. and all kinds of tiny hairs were removed! .... it doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt; hurt, either!!  Am very happy with it, best one I have gotten yet, and because there are no batteries, it will probably last me for years!...</li>
    <li> Works better than those electric ones at Bed, Bath and Beyond.</li>
    <li> A good item but may get rusty after long kept</li>
    <li> This item works great as other reviews said and is well built easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended and the best part no more batteries</li>
    <li> Great product, very effective indeed!</li>
    <li> Arrived much faster than I thought. I have used several battery powered trimmers in the past, each of them pulled my nose hairs and never really did the job. Stuck this thing up my nose, turned it about 10 times, now when I breath it feels like my nostrils have tripled in size. I have no more nose hair, and I never even felt it. Completely silent as well, discretion was an added bonus. 100% recommended</li>
    <li> It works well but it does pull a hair when you pull the groom mate out of your nose sometimes.</li>
    <li> Item easy to use and possibly better in some repects when compared to electric nose clippers that I have used to date.</li>
    <li> Throw away the chinese battery powered garbage and pick up something that works well every time. I am very impressed by the quality of this product and am so happy I switched from a plastic, battery operated trimmer. Easy to use, maintenance free, and well built.</li>
    <li> Great find! Love this little trimmer!!!!</li>
    <li> Just a simple set of clipper inside of the the tube.  You twist the bottom for cutting action.  This works much better than the electric clippers I&#x27;ve tried, with blades that tug instead of cutting or batteries that always need changing.  The only thing this cuts is hair, and it cuts not pulls.  Recommended</li>
    <li> It works as advertised - it can and will pull some hairs vs cut them which is why I marked it down.&lt;br /&gt;I can use scissors with no pulling - this device offers higher safety overall.&lt;br /&gt;Built like a tank, not expecting to buy another pair unless this one happens to get lost.</li>
    <li> This was bought as a gift for me.  I really like it because it is not electrical.  It works really well, just make sure you spin it quickly.</li>
    <li> Have ordered many things thru Amazon always been happy. Groom mate platinum xl never showed up. Man from company emailed me to see if I  was happy. Told him of my problem. NO RESPONCE !!!  Jim</li>
    <li> Had high expectations.  Works okay with some effort, but does not cut quite as closely as I&#x27;d hoped.  Nice heft, however, and nicely made.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product. In this age of cheap plastic products that last a year or two and then fail, this is a lovely anomaly--it reeks of precision and care in design and in manufacturing. It is surprisingly easy to use (i. e. very easy), painless, and never a battery to replace!</li>
    <li> Unlike electric trimmers, this one always works and you dont have to charge it.</li>
    <li> With so many other positive reviews, mine is probably not required. But I was compelled considering the impressive performance of this trimmer.     To be honest, I ordered it without reading the description carefully and assumed it used a small battery. I liked its compact yet heavy-duty stainless appearance. I was so disappointed when I first opened the package, but that was quickly dispersed when I tried it out.    I have owned battery powered trimmers. Each was purchased after much research and comparison - only to achieve the same \\&quot;ho-hum\\&quot; capability.     It seemed that none trimmed close enough to suit me, as if trimmer designs were so paranoid about nicking your skin, they sacrificed the main objective of closely trimming the unwanted hairs.    This little guy amazed me. It trims closely without irritation, its operation is easy and bearing-like smooth, and it needs no battery. It is a solid, well constructed stainless steel unit made to last.    I realize it is not going an item to call all your friends about or discuss with excitement over dinner, but when a device works well in this age of exaggerated advertisement, it deserves proper acknowledgement.     One key instruction to be highlited (for those who typically skip reading them): Rotate the base back and forth to operate the trimmer, rather than in one constant direction. Other than that - prepare yourself for simplicity, quality, and satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Trimmer is very basic and finger powered. It is very small, good for carrying in a hand bag or on a trip. However, it is truly ineffecient. It would be worth it to buy a battery powered trimmer. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I finally got tired of people graciously handing me tissue after I&#x27;d blown my nose.  I did my internet research and decided upon this item.  It is easy to use and I have had no more offers of tissue!  A fine investment.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair trimmer,it does not trim and it is very difficult to use. Please do not buy this product and waste your money</li>
    <li> The Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer does the job but one must be gentle about the nose and not to sneeze while probing.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even realize my hair was being cut, I couldn&#x27;t hear or feel anything, and before I realized it, my nose was totally empty.</li>
    <li> Wow.  This thing is solid.  I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the idea of a non-motorized trimmer, but the great reviews convinced me to buy it, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  This thing is awesome.  Just place it in the ear or nose and twist back and forth.  I think this thing will still be around for my grandkids to use.  It&#x27;s solid, simple, and reliable.  I highly recommend this hair trimmer.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic tool for us men as we age and hairs spring up. I&#x27;ve tried multiple things to keep the nose hairs under control from scissors to small Wahl clippers but this simple and well priced tool does the trick. Thouroughly recommend it. For those who say it cuts them, don&#x27;t jam it into you skin.</li>
    <li> I used to use a panasonic battery powered model that would pinch and pull and was really difficult to get to cut everything properly.  So I was very surprised at the effectiveness of this design.  Feels very solid and well made.  It cuts so fast and smoothly that I was genuinely surprised how quickly and easily it worked.  Requires two hands to operate.</li>
    <li> I opened this thing 5 minutes ago and said \\&quot;where the eff is the power button\\&quot; i thought manual meant it could be adjusted in a way other than no electricity. But, after using this thing in my nose I was very very impressed. Clean cut, very fast, very easy. Amazed at this thing that doesn&#x27;t require a battery. I love this new toy that I own. Super cool</li>
    <li> I have a Panasonic ER-GN30-K in addition to this Groom Mate but ended up using the Groom Mate much more because the build quality of the Panasonic I did not find that good.  The Groom Mate, by comparison, is built like a tank.  Plus the Groom Mate is completely manual so no need for batteries like with the Panasonic... The cutting edges of the Groom Mate are also very deep when compared to the Panasonic, which makes it easier to cut hairs.  5 stars for a great product!</li>
    <li> This is a Christmas stocking stuffer for my husband to replace one he had that quit working.  I hope he will like it as much as the one he had that no longer works.</li>
    <li> Pretty ok, not great, I prefer the er-gn30 by panasonic, but this is not bad for a manual item without batteries, cuts ok, seems to be a bit difficult to reach some areas.</li>
    <li> It you want manual this is for you. I tried using it but it didn&#x27;t meet my needs. The company was kind enought to refund my money and let me keep it. I donated it locally and hopefully someone else can use it.</li>
    <li> He loves it, design, lifetime blade sharpness.  You have to hold this and twist the bottom to use it.  If you like that function this is the one to get</li>
    <li> This is more costly than other nose &amp; hair trimmers, but this is one that will last, doesn&#x27;t need batteries and cuts perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pinch the unit between two fingers and then use my other hand to twist.  The entire unit does not twist, only the internal cutting block.  So you twist back and forth as you move amongst troubled areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For cleaning, rinse under water - easy.  For more in depth cleaning you can disassemble with one screw to clean &amp; lubricate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a perfect travel accessory as its so small and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in the USA and backed by excellent support.After 3 years of use, I had a problem and contacted the manufacture.  Email was answered the same day with great service and they fully stand behind their product.</li>
    <li> It is a lot easier to use than my previous tool (round-nosed scissors) and just as effective. I have never experienced any pulling or other discomfort.</li>
    <li> This is simple to use and keep clean but it does not provide the close trim needed for your ears.</li>
    <li> Trimmer works great, very handy for nose and ear hair removal, I have had other products that workd so so, but this works fine, shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Whether electric or manual-the essence is the hair is ripped out.  It does take a bit to maneuver the appliance</li>
    <li> The sellers for this product&#x27;s are amazingly awesome it if you ever have any issues they will fix it in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Did not like the product, not worth spending money on it, not easy to use.  Went back to my original method &amp;#34;Scissors&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Works great but I prefer the electric models, requires to much work for nothing.</li>
    <li> These are by far the best nose hair trimmers on the market don&#x27;t waste your time with anything else. Built to last a lifetime!</li>
    <li> I purchased mine on 10/19/09 to deal with the consequences of getting older. I have used it once per week or so since then and have never been disappointed. It came in a small plastic tube for storage that I still use in my medicine cabinet. I love that it&#x27;s small enough to not take up any space in the cabinet but effective enough to only take a minute to do the entire job. They say it is guaranteed to never cut your skin? They&#x27;re exactly right, I&#x27;ve never been nicked or experienced pain from &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; vice &amp;#34;cutting&amp;#34; hairs. It takes the hairs right out, no itching or anything. I love this product and so will you.</li>
    <li> Good trimmer-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to self that the right angle makes a world of difference in performance of the cutting blades.</li>
    <li> No batteries, no complications, no weird buzzing inside your skull through your nose.&lt;br /&gt;You just twist and no shout, no pain, just no more hair. My nose&#x27;s hair has never looked dapper. Easy and quick.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a thing against buzzing tickles from motors in your cartilage appendices, get it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap, works great,it&#x27;s clean and it&#x27;s quick.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised but doesn&#x27;t work as easy as I would expected.  I am pleased with it but not over joyed.</li>
    <li> Craftsmanship is very good. Doesn&#x27;t need electricity to operate which is good and bad. Need to figure out how to turn the base and get the trimmer close to the skin inside your nose for a cutting. Cleans up easily. Delivery was faster than expected. Overall very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> This was my own fault as I missed the part where it said this was manual.  The build is excellent but I wanted one that is battery charged.</li>
    <li> Feels good &amp; solid, does the job without knicks or cuts[[ASIN:B000EBFJXS Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer]]</li>
    <li> not a good product for me, difficult to use.</li>
    <li> Well made and is perfect for traveling. All mechanical and seems precision made. Works as described. Should last a lifetime no matter how much hair grows out of your ears.</li>
    <li> Does what it is suppose to do  Control of where you put the trimmer and control of how fast you operate</li>
    <li> I love the design, no batteries to worry about and easy to clean. It does pull a hair or two now and then but I haven&#x27;t cried yet. I had it for over a year and it still works like day one. The only thing is that it takes a bit longer to get the job done (vs. electric) and you need two hands to operate. If I had to get another nose hair trimmer, say I lost this one, I would buy this one again over an electric. It&#x27;s built like a tank.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s manual so it takes a bit of doing.  However, it&#x27;s doing does very well.  Cleans to a whistle.  Nice weight.  Compact.  Quite happy with it when I have time to use it.  Works better with the nose than the ears, because it&#x27;s just a bit awkward being manual in that area.  Fun to work with tho and worth the effort.</li>
    <li> I have used these for a number of years and they are far superior to any electric trimmer I have used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had three of these over the years; still have two. They work well, will last longer than I will and ... best part ... don&#x27;t need batteries. Well, of course I don&#x27;t need batteries to run either.  Yet. Beware of losing the tiny screw, it&#x27;s not easy to replace.</li>
    <li> Since the groomer is manually done it does not operate very well.  It is difficult to twist the device manually and get to the right spots</li>
    <li> An unusual product, quality-built and does the job.  It will last forever, as there&#x27;s nothing to break or wear out.&lt;br /&gt;Made in USA is what I like, too.</li>
    <li> Getting older and dealing with hair on my body where it didn&#x27;t used to be has just become a grim reality I&#x27;ve had to accept. Likewise, as I brace myself for the grim reality of the rapidly approaching post-industrial crash of our petroleum based society, where the abundance of electricity i take so much for granted now will be a story i tell to wide-eyed disbelieving youngsters....well, it just seems that every little thing i do to ween myself from the cheaply made and easily disposable goods that define our culture, especially those that run on batteries or plug in --when they don&#x27;t necessarily have to-- is a token step in the right direction. So it was with much civic pride that I ordered this self-powered nose and ear hair trimmer thingey.....and i&#x27;ll be damned, it works like a charm. the package says that it&#x27;s built to last forever, so i look forward to keeping up my grooming habits while fending off hoards of looters in the not so distant future....</li>
    <li> If you keep rotating it in the same direction, it grabs the hairs (instead of cutting them) and then yanks them out. Ouch! Twisting it back-and-forth avoids the yanking, but then hairs won&#x27;t be caught by the device at all. YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, this is a extremely well-engineered, highly-precision-crafted device. But it still won&#x27;t grab/cut the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted it as a compact solution for travel, but it&#x27;s just not going to \\&quot;cut it.\\&quot; I&#x27;ll have to pack my day-to-day go-to, the [[ASIN:B000W405SG Philips Norelco NT9110 Nose and Ear Hair Trimmer]].</li>
    <li> Works great and is painless. Also no batteries to be worried about or some electrical thing to have break down when needed.</li>
    <li> I see some reviews talking about how this device is pulling hairs out of their noses, and I haven&#x27;t had that problem at all, and I have been using it for a few months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the best advice I can give is to keep turning it as you pull it out of your nose. Just keep turning it the whole time you are using it so it keep trimming the hairs and doesn&#x27;t get any lodged in for you to pull out. I do this and have zero problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great. I use it regularly and have never had it pinch me or pull a hair. It cleans easily just by running water over it in the sink. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Does a very good job. Allot better than the electric ones. Well built very  good Quality! Looks like it will last along time!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it was manual.  Does a lousy job and pulls hair.</li>
    <li> xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxx xxx x xxxx xxx xxx xx x xx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</li>
    <li> This is the best i have ever used!  Very high quality,  i&#x27;m gonna purchase 3 more for my brothers .  awesome no batteries to replace!</li>
    <li> The Groom Mate is the best I&#x27;ve found for personal hygiene.  It beats the electric rotary styles (I&#x27;ve had three) in both size and weight.....and frankly, is nearly just as fast.  The razor sharp cutters allows for no pulling and good depth so trimming isn&#x27;t a bi-weekly task.  Using two hands to operate the cutters is odd at first but isn&#x27;t complicated.</li>
    <li> This product is well-made, but I&#x27;m disappointed in the operation of it.  It tends to pull some hairs rather than cut them, leaving tears in my eyes and the need to use my Norelco battery operated trimmer to complete the task.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had those microtrimmers that are shown on TV and only one of them worked for any length of time. I&#x27;m getting out of the &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; mindset and was looking for something to fit the bill when it came to trimming hair. This is it!!!! No more worries about cutters dulling or batteries dying.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a super complicated object, but it gets the job done well. The material is nice, a bit heavy (but in a good, quality way). Would sugest the &amp;#34;two hander&amp;#34; XL version...its really not that big and the control you get with it is worth it</li>
    <li> I need a real hair trimmer for nose. Very minor hair but it gets itchy and ugly fast. I used a garbage semi-disposable drug store electric model for several years but it never left me really impressed. This is a man&#x27;s tool and looks to last a lifetime. This is for people who know good quality and demand it. This is a Breitling or Rolex in a world of Timexes. Buy it and enjoy. Yeah it tugs once in a while. We&#x27;re men - we can handle it.</li>
    <li> This thing works!  I&#x27;ll never use an electric again!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was recommended as being a more buy-it-for-life type item, and my nose hair isn&#x27;t going away anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just doesn&#x27;t do the job very well at all. It is not just a simple move around and twist, you basically have to manually feed hair into the barrel. No easier than remembering to recharge an electric one.</li>
    <li> awesome for trimming the noise. easy to carry around. I lost the first one i bought, so bought a second. it&#x27;s a bit expensive though.</li>
    <li> Sharp blades, does not make you tear and cuts very well, I have had it for some years. It will last forever. Hard to find the non- battery operated ones. this is one, worth the money</li>
    <li> Works, one less thing to deal with batteries for, machining tolerance on the two parts is pretty low but it works.</li>
    <li> Works great! It is a well-made piece of hardware. Feels solid in your hand. I bought this because I was tired of cutting my nostrils and boy does it do a fabulous job. The battery operated nose-hair trimmers are too much of a bother. This is the way to go.</li>
    <li> This product is a waste of time and money. Stay with the battery operated trimmers.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative to the battery-operated trimmers I&#x27;ve bought in the past, as they consistently stopped working after a few months of use.  I was skeptical about the manual labor involved with working this device, but I have been pleasantly surprised at its ease and effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top marks for quality construction, as it feels heavy and sturdy in the hand.</li>
    <li> i have used several of the electric operated trimmer and almost everyone has been junk. this fixed that instantly.. just twist and trim. cleaning is a breeze. just unscrew the locking scren and it come apart in two pieces. water and paperwork or tissue and it&#x27;s fairly easy to clean. the only reason i give it a 4 instead of a 5 is that it&#x27;s hard to clean inbetween the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; on the trimmer. it&#x27;s a very small opening so a tissue or paperwork is about all that will fit in those crevices, but the blade edge tears the cleaning paper and water alone will not clean it out. it&#x27;s not big deal, just something to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve had it a while now, maybe a year or so.. it hasn&#x27;t went dull and it continues to operate exactly as i want.</li>
    <li> Great product and doesn&#x27;t have china stamped on it. Every time I need it it works, don&#x27;t need to change batteries.</li>
    <li> Like most men, I am getting an abundance of hair growing from my ears and my nose as I age. I could go on and on about how this is ridiculous, but I am at least happy to steal have a head of hair. My wife has this thing about cords in the bathroom and always unplugs my electric razor, so this is a fantastic device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks and feels like something that will last forever and that is something that I can stand behind. I have yet to encounter any problems with the trimmer grabbing my hair, nor have I had any problems with using two hands to operate. I dare say this is better than any electric razor that you can use for a similar purpose. This is also fantastic to travel with, comes in a nice tube that fits perfectly in your toiletry bag.</li>
    <li> Works great. Stainless steel looks like it will last long. Has a good weighty, well built solid feel to it. Probably the best mechanical nose hair trimmer out there.</li>
    <li> Great pocket trimmer.  Made the good old fashioned way, TO LAST!</li>
    <li> A little labor intensive, I guess that means it&#x27;s &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;.The nose is not green, but I need Six more words.</li>
    <li> This product works great!  I was pleasantly surprised it worked better than other battery operated similar ones I have tried.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the item itself as I had it gift wrapped and sent to my son for christmas. It was the only gift we sent (others delivered by hand later on).&lt;br /&gt;He does seem to like it although he is still using it very cautiously. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review is about the gift wrapping offered by the company Groom Mate - PHR Systems, Ltd. . I typically don&#x27;t pay for it, but for previous reasons I opted to.  When I asked my son if he got his package when I was notified it was delivered, he said \\&quot;you mean the nose hair trimmer?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;How did he know it was when he didn&#x27;t open it?&lt;br /&gt;There was an insert from the company between the two boxes about the item.  What are they thinking???? Can I get my money back on the wrapping?</li>
    <li> High quality i expected for a usa made product</li>
    <li> It just simply is not very good. It would be ok - I guess - in a survival situation where you didn&#x27;t have any power for an electric trimmer, but then again why would trimming your nose hairs be important in a survival situation?</li>
    <li> I like how it is easy to use, I never have to worry about batteries, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about sharpening it.</li>
    <li> This nose trimmer is perfect. I dont get a lot of nose hair and have had  few of the battery operated trimmers and they are just a pain to deal with. This thing is razor sharp and with a few quick twists I&#x27;m all cleaned up. I was very doubtful about ordering this at first but i am very happy with it. Best part its made in the USA</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I decided to purchase this tool as an alternative to an electric trimmer.  I found it easy to use and it worked well and quickly.  I did NOT experience any of the hair pulling that other reviewers mentioned.  It is a simple yet sturdy device that looks like it will last a long, long time.  Who knows, it might become a family heirloom...  &amp;#34;Son, here is the nose hair trimmer your grandpa used to use...&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I am a young and not particularly hairy guy.  I have had a couple of those battery-powered units both of which have ceased to operate in a year or two.  This thing however, is built like it came from NASA.  As long as I don&#x27;t loose it, I think it&#x27;ll last my lifetime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this one.</li>
    <li> I think there are two kinds of people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Who think all nose hairs are bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Who believe that nose hairs are good, as long as they&#x27;re not visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you belong in the first category, this is an excellent product. Very well made, good material, sharp edge, safe design and so on. It will trim 95% of your hair down to nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the 5% of the hairs this thing will not trim, are the worst offenders (in my opinion). The ones that are visible. Those, you&#x27;ll have to trim using another method. This tool does not lend itself much to focusing on a specific area. A scatter gun more than a shot gun, if you may.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I belong to the second category of people. Hence for me, this tool this pretty much useless. I know I may sound like an old fashioned technophobe, but I think the best thing you can use is a good pair of scissors.</li>
    <li> The trimmer does work and works well with no pain or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...it does take some patience to find the correct angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t just shove up you nose and expect immediate, perfect perfect results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also need to rotate the knurled section back and forth to properly cut your hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well made with quality materials.</li>
    <li> I have had this trimmer for a while now and use it once a week on those pesky hairs. It work great.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He likes it, it cuts clean and no batteries, no noise and a rotary turner so he cannot cut his skin. I would recommend this for any man.</li>
    <li> It is too clunky to trim the smaller hairs so for this to actually work you have grow them out to 1/4 inch before the blades will cut a hair and then it can&#x27;t trim it very close.  Don&#x27;t bother.  It is overbuilt to survive a direct hit fro a meteor and still function...if you can call what it does functioning.</li>
    <li> I do a lot of research and reading of reviews before purchasing anything for the first time sight unseen (Internet). Despite the overwhelming amount of positive reviews, I was still concerned over the negative reviews. It took me a couple of months to bite but I am glad that I did finally bite...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing wrong with this product or design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for one of these twist type nose hair trimmers for 20 years or so; my father had one similar long ago, as I get older and more of his genetics are unlocked in me, I recognize more now than ever the need for this thing. About ten years ago, I purchased one of the single hand pinch types, I did not use it long as it grabbed and ripped hairs out on a regular basis. This twist type is super sharp, the tolerances are tight and the material and manufacturing are quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, I did not have a problem with twisting slowly, the key to keep from grabbing and yanking out hairs is that you have to twirl it with a little bit of speed. Additionally,  this thing is not designed to give you a smooth shave inside your nose or ears, its meant to give you a hair cut; I have used electric units in the past and they are most often designed to get closer to the base of the hair, this trimmer is EXACTLY what it says it is, a trimmer! Therefor, you are going to have a little stubble after a trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like stainless steel, I like manufacturing in the United States, I like quality products that lasts, I like this trimmer!</li>
    <li> The Groom Mate is sturdy, the blades are sharp, and it cuts cleanly. More importantly (to me at least), it is manual action so it doesn&#x27;t need batteries and there are no electronics to wear out. For people saying this tugs, perhaps these people are using it wrong? The instructions tell you to turn it back and forth, not just turning it in one direction, and I&#x27;ve never had a tugged hair.</li>
    <li> A bit high priced, but works like a charm and has a very solid/heavy feel.I tried to find one of these in my local stores, but could not,</li>
    <li> Good build quality and works pretty well.  It&#x27;s not super easy to get every single hair but then maybe it&#x27;s not supposed to..I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
    <li> You know how a really good, really sharp pair of scissors makes that blade-against-blade sound when you cut with them?  The feel of really sharp, really precise edges sliding against each other?  These have that when you twist the knob.  Feels like a precision stainless piece of surgical gear.  Cuts effortlessly, seems that you can not cut or injure yourself.  If these cutters were available on a battery powered cutter it would be fantastic.  For a once a week, 2 minute job, manual is fine.&lt;br /&gt;Easily cleaned with a rinse, and you can disassemble as well for deeper cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good tool, pricy, but good.</li>
    <li> I got tired of snipping and poking the inside of my nose with scissors so I decided to try a groommate.  It is easy to use and I like the fact that I don&#x27;t need to put batteries in it.  As long as you keep spinning the barrel it will not pull  any hairs out, but if you don&#x27;t spin the barrel as your inserting in your nostril it will catch and pull hairs.</li>
    <li> Batteries are for suckers.</li>
    <li> this is a pretty simple device that takes care of a grooming issue a lot of us have  its reasonably priced  it works  plain and simple&lt;br /&gt;and don&#x27;t listen to some of these claims of Chinese water torture regarding its use .......  I have used three battery operated devices in the past few years  and im not a klutz  but managed to break each one of them  ...  this no batteries ...  just use your fingers  twist it both ways  and ..........nose hairs gone  ......ok might take a minute or so to get used to.........</li>
    <li> Very nicely made. Seems it will last for a very long time. Just don&#x27;t ever tap the cutting end on something hard as a means to clean it. You will possibly bend one of the cutting edges.</li>
    <li> My husband actually uses this!</li>
    <li> I returned the trimmer. it is no good</li>
    <li> Works well to trim the nose hairs, but I do still get the occasional nose hair pulled out.  I&#x27;ve also somehow managed to cut the inside of my nose slightly while using the trimmer.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m just dumb or unlucky, but the cut on the inside of my nose only happened once.</li>
    <li> The Groom Mate is not as comfortable to use as I had hoped.  It pulls on the hair and takes longer than a battery operated groomer</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy one with a motor, these work great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as described but perhaps it should also be noted that compared with scissors or electric nose trimmers, a manual trimmer can be a bit painful to use...</li>
    <li> An extremely well made product. I have tried many trimmers over the years, and this is the first one that really works!  Made in USA to boot...</li>
    <li> Just got it in the mail and tried it out. Seems like it works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No need for batteries, ever&lt;br /&gt;Small and compact&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little expensive for what it is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Cuts cleanly and painlessly. Cuts much more thoroughly than I could even have hoped. Well worth the price, esp compared to items costing half as much that just don&#x27;t deliver.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence with this one, I can enthusiastically encourage you to pull the trigger. Fulfillment by groommate was awesome, ordered late Friday/early saturday, arrived Monday.</li>
    <li> I got mine, and used it almost right away, and am very pleased.  It cuts easy with no pulling, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;ve stuck a bumblebee up your nose like the battery operated ones do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very solidly built, and I expect it to outlast me.  It is smaller than it looks- mine is roughly 3&amp;#34; long by about 3/8&amp;#34; in diameter, but that&#x27;s good- it&#x27;s easier to pack and store.</li>
    <li> Probably the best built item I have bought in ten years! Works great. Has a very solid feel and some weight. The people that gave bad reviews probably couldn&#x27;t figure out how to put batteries in it (no batteries!).</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this.  It really doesn&#x27;t cut the hairs much at all.  And then when you remove from your nose or ear...you get to experience to having a ton of hair ripped out.  It&#x27;s quite an experience to rip out your nose hair like that.  I won&#x27;t forget that for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried changing the way I use it.  The instructions say to turn the base back and forth.  That doesn&#x27;t work.  I tried continuously turning the base in one direction...also doesn&#x27;t work.  Your best bet is to turn the base back and forth as you slowly remove the unit so that it has less of a chance to get a grip on the hairs.  But even that doesn&#x27;t work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking forward to a compact, non-powered unit like this.  But I&#x27;m very sorry to say that using this was pure torture.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simple and straightforward, but is well made and does exactly what it is supposed to.  I use it for nose hair trimming and it works well with no pulling.</li>
    <li> If you are tired of electronic nose trimmer that are under power.  You should try this out.</li>
    <li> My order came quick and as described. The device itself works fine, but it would be nice if it cut a bit shorter.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is junk, but it sure looks great.&lt;br /&gt;Does not function - period.  Blades spin around and do nothing.</li>
    <li> Does a fairly good job but its expensive and heavy .  It is manual, so thats good if you plan to use it while traveling, or backpacking.  But if using while traveling or backpacking, its unnecessarily heavy - which is why I don&#x27;t use it for that.&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased an electric travel size system instead with replaceable AA batteries for use on the road because it has different heads for different uses, and cost about 15$ more than this.  It is plastic construction and without the batteries in it, weights just slightly more but offers huge versatility over this unit.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER this is a great item too and does the job well.</li>
    <li> Works ok and it very well made.</li>
    <li> I recommend a power or battery powered one</li>
    <li> heavy duty nose hair trimmer!</li>
    <li> Heavy duty, this can last forever</li>
    <li> This thing is terrific.  I&#x27;ve gone through about half a dozen electric trimmers that either die or don&#x27;t cut the hair at all, so I was relieved to finally buy the last trimmer I&#x27;ll ever need and not have to concern myself with keeping batteries around the house or packed for trips.  It takes a little getting used to, but I had no issues after just a couple of minutes figuring it out.  When you get the hang of spinning it quickly, you won&#x27;t experience any tugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the people down-rating this because you have to use two hands...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) What did you expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) There&#x27;s another version of this that you squeeze with one hand to spin if this really bugs you...I haven&#x27;t used it, so I can&#x27;t speak to its quality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Groom Mate Platinum XL since 2009, and it has always worked great until recently, when it started to become painful to use. The trimmer seemed to not work as smoothly and I thought perhaps the blades had dulled or it was just getting old. I figured I&#x27;d come on Amazon and purchase another since I&#x27;d liked it so much. When I arrived at this page, I realized this trimmer has a lifetime warranty! I contacted the company and told them that it just wasn&#x27;t working like it used to. They wrote back within an hour to confirm my address, and they priority shipped me a new one for free. For a product I&#x27;d purchased 3 years ago. If that isn&#x27;t customer service and standing behind your product, I don&#x27;t know what is. The new trimmer came today and it works just like I remembered!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip I&#x27;d give as a long term user- the packaging says that when you clean out the trimmer (by taking the small screw off the side)- to use household oil to re-lubricate it before putting it back together. Had I done this, I&#x27;m guessing my trimmer would have lasted longer.</li>
    <li> It also takes some dexterity.  Not everyone will think that it&#x27;s being hardly larger than a AAA battery will outweigh its being harder to use than a good rotary battery-powered trimmer.</li>
    <li> Does what it says, no batteries, and compact. I like it.</li>
    <li> It works!  Simply put, this is the best trimmer I have found.  I have been looking for a long time, and most trimmers of this type have too-narrow slots that don&#x27;t allow the hairs to get into the trimmer.  THIS trimmer has good, wide slots so the hairs actually get into it so they can be trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The construction of this trimmer is amazing.  It is high-quality, nicely-machined stainless steel.  It can come apart if needed for cleaning, but so far I have not needed to take mine apart.  It cleans nicely either by blowing into it, or by using the supplied cleaning brush.</li>
    <li> This product is Awesome! It requires no batteries and works right out of the box. The blades are sharp and easy to use. No learning curve required, just place it in your nostril rotate the bottom left to right and your done.</li>
    <li> I have had 2 battery operated nose trimmers which just were not very good. This one is a simple operating unit that is built to last a life time.</li>
    <li> Great product that does cuts the nose hairs without any pulling. No more hair growing into my mustache. Top product.</li>
    <li> It works, is made in the USA and is simple.  However, with the wrong move it&#x27;ll feel like you&#x27;re pulling hairs...mainly because you literally will be.  It does work luckily, just not exactly as well as I thought it would.  Good news is that it&#x27;ll last a long time and will server it&#x27;d purpose, just not with flying colors.</li>
    <li> Great reviews out numbered the negative ones by far so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  The trimmer was delivered quickly and was in one of those easy open plastic packages not the sealed ones.  As with many other reviewers, I found the construction of the product to be outstanding.  It&#x27;s very solid.  Upon first use, I was apprehensive to go deep using both hands and pushing hard for fear of cutting the inner surface of the nose.  Finally I tried it and I was amazed how accurate and safe the Groom Mate is. There were no cuts, or unpleaseant pulls.  The cleanup was a breeze (just ran water over it).  The next few times that I used it I achieved the same results, therefore 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Painless.  Works great.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it! It doesn&#x27;t get his ear hair as well as I would like as it is a bit tricky to use in your ears, but gets the nose hair well. At least he won&#x27;t be plucking his nose hair out with his fingers while he&#x27;s driving. He said he was surprised at how well made and sturdy it was. Best Father&#x27;s Day gift I&#x27;ve ever gotten him!</li>
    <li> broken despite limited use. I&#x27;m back to electric units. Will return it if not too late. Any other users&#x27; feedback?</li>
    <li> Great product. Much better than any I have tried in the past.</li>
    <li> does what it&#x27;s supposed to and it will probably last forever.</li>
    <li> My husband says &amp;#34;it does what it does very well.&amp;#34;  He&#x27;s very happy with the results and I&#x27;m glad I found it for him in the Amazon reviews.</li>
    <li> Very well made, heavy, works great, and does exactly what it says.  I also have the other single handed squeeze one, made in Japan, which also works great.</li>
    <li> I wa;s disapponted in how it works -- it just does seem to get the nose and ear haris. Win some lose some.</li>
    <li> This nose hair trimer works wonderful and I use it all the time for my nose hair. Easy to clean and easy to use no pulling of the hair in your nose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get used to this but not matter how many times I try, this thing always feels like it is pulling out (and not cutting) the hair.  For the price, I was hoping for something a little better</li>
    <li> This unti works as intended and I like that it doesn&#x27;t require batteries. Not sure what else to say since trimming hair out of my nose and ears rates right up there with dropping bricks on my toes as a favorite thing to do.</li>
    <li> This is a great little tool. Effective. Cheap. No batteries needed. Other reviewers mention it pulled rather than cut their hair. This is an issue of technique rather than a shortcoming of the tool. You have to remember to rotate it to trim, THEN remove it from your nose/ear. Takes a very little bit to get used to it but I adjusted in a minute. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Does what the description says it will do, is easy to use, never needs batteries, and is very sturdily constructed.</li>
    <li> Way more effective than the electric models I have been using.  Its also better made, you can&#x27;t really break it without trying really hard.</li>
    <li> I was pretty skeptical about this product. I&#x27;ve used ear and nose trimmers from several companies before, and none of them delivered on their promises. Sharper Image, Norelco, Braun, all came up short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Groom Mates. They just worked. I learned the hard way how to use them, and still hit the occasional (and painful) snag when I am not focused on what I am doing. But , boy, do these deliver the goods. Don&#x27;t let the negative reviews fool you. They are either people who are too lazy to use these, had a bad experience with shipping(its not a product problem) or they are paid to put up negative reviews for this product with links to their sponsor&#x27;s product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use these on my ears, just my nose, and they work fine.</li>
    <li> very handy little tool.</li>
    <li> By far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.  It is manual, but all of the electronic ones work like toys next to this.  It&#x27;s built like a tank and works amazing.  I have had it a while and judging by the build and quality it could last forever if taken care of.</li>
    <li> this is the worlds best trimmer by far.. it is so well made that its retarded.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This product is made to last, and it works great. There is practically no maintenance and does not require battery&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;It is American made product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it at all. Went back to my battery powered trimmer.</li>
    <li> Perfect tool for nose hair.</li>
    <li> Take care of nose hair with nose problem</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually review items I buy on Amazon, but I&#x27;m making an exception for this, which is made in the old mid-20th Century American tradition of manufacturing to last several lifetimes.  It doesn&#x27;t require batteries!  (A Wahl battery-powered nose trimmer I had only lasted a month before it went kerplunkt!)  It works great for me!</li>
    <li> it is simple to use, no batteries. does pull nose hairs a bit causing some minor pain. but hey no pain, no gain. keeps my wife happy about the lack of nose and ear hair. first product I have used that really seems to work. fair price.</li>
    <li> tended to &#x27;catch&#x27; the hair and pull, rather than cut</li>
    <li> If, like me, you find yourself growing an ever-increasing amount of annoying nose hair as you get into early adulthood, this nose hair trimmer is fantastic.  It&#x27;s manual so there is basically no maintenance required.  It takes a little bit of work to learn how to use it effectively (e.g. holding it at the correct angle, getting hairs into the grooves, etc.), but it&#x27;s totally worth it.  This is the only nose hair trimmer you will ever need.</li>
    <li> These are heavy stainless construction, and work great.  It is nice to be able to run it under the faucet to clean it without worry.  Let it air dry and throw it back in the drawer.  I was always wary of being able to get the old battery powered one clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you aren&#x27;t twisting it fast enough, it can occasionally grab hairs just a little, but once you get the technique down, no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> It functions fairly well.  But I find the powered ones better.  Small size and lack of batteries make it convenient for trips.  2 handed operation less convenient.</li>
    <li> I feel duped by all of the positive reviews.  This product is horrible.  Its so small that it is difficult to use.  After some time, I was able to extract some nose hairs but it left me in pain for days.  Even a little bloody.  Basically, the tool slowly pulls out hairs - or at least did for me.  There was no trimming.  So if you like pain and inconvenience, this is your product.  Otherwise, buy something, anything, else.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews: this product does the job well.</li>
    <li> Smooth and simple. I like to think James Bond would carry one of these next to his MI6 flask grenade. It works well. Keep it dry though, I tossed my previous one because it rusted over time due to not wiping it dry after rinsing.</li>
    <li> the bottom part does not turn top,pulls out hairs,misses the rest</li>
    <li> No more nose fur! Simple to use no batteries cleans up super easy. All you furry nose hair challenged gorrillas next this! Works in ears too!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit surprised by the amazing reviews on here. There is plenty to like about the product but it is far from perfect or even ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;-Build quality is excellent. There is no doubt it will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s compact and does take up much space making it easy for travel.&lt;br /&gt;-No batteries to wear out. Your fingers and the blade do all the work&lt;br /&gt;-does a decent job of trimming your nose hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I dislike:&lt;br /&gt;-Anyone who claims it is pain-free is out of their minds. It&#x27;s not torture like plucking your hair with tweezers but you definitely feel uncomfortable tugs throughout the process. Someone with a sensitive nose like me will definitely prefer something electric.&lt;br /&gt;-Because it&#x27;s so small, it takes some finesse to use. Big fingers like mine can be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;-the trimming it provides isn&#x27;t extremely close. Most nose/ear hair trimmers suffer from this same problem but it seems to me that there has to be a close trim available somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;-takes longer than electric. Perhaps I&#x27;m just lazy but I prefer electric in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I have yet to find a nose/ear hair trimmer that I like. This one does the job but I find myself avoiding it because it is mildly painful and obnoxious to use.</li>
    <li> Did not last.  I wanted one that wouldn&#x27;t die after a year or so of light use, as the panasonic i bought as well as another similar battery operated one.  Unfortunately this simply got stuck after about 2 years of light use.  And yes, I kept it very clean.  It&#x27;s also hard to use, requiring both hands.</li>
    <li> mine has started to rust in between the ridges. Will try to get it replaced under warranty. As far as use, I prefer an electric trimmer. This one is awkward when doing your ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Works great, never go back to an electric one again.</li>
    <li> When I first used this device I thought it was great, but before long it was pinching me and pulling hair.  I replaced it with a Panasonic battery-operated model which I like and have reviewed elsewhere.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is quality stainless steel - and while it takes a bit of experimenting to find the best angle to snip those d%&amp;# hairs, it&#x27;s actually easy to do. Washes clean under hot water and you&#x27;re ready to go</li>
    <li> I eagerly awaited this &amp;#34;Made in the USA&amp;#34; nose hair trimmer just to learn how it worked. It works superbly! I had been using a Panasonic, AA battery-powered, nose hair trimmer for over a year. However, it doesn&#x27;t perform as well as this Groom Mate trimmer. A couple twists in your nose (and ears) and you&#x27;re looking good. Highly recommended...</li>
    <li> Probably the best test of whether an item is worth having is whether or not you&#x27;d buy it again if you ever lost it. This trimmer passes the test with flying colors. I had looked all over for mine after a move and couldn&#x27;t find it. I popped this into my wish list (I pick a few items to buy based on priority each payday) and was just about ready to pull the trigger when my wife found it in a box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid construction, this thing is machined to tight tolerances and losing it is the only reason you&#x27;d have to replace one because I can&#x27;t see the thing every breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again? Heck, I almost did!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product that I&#x27;ve continued to gift to family and friends over the years (because nothing says I love you like a gift suggesting you might have a body hair problem).  I&#x27;ve been using the same one for many years now, and it&#x27;s never failed me.  I&#x27;m seeing many reviews about this this thing pulling hair, and I just have to say you might be doing it wrong.  I&#x27;ve not experienced this before.  If you&#x27;re sick of adding battery operated trimmers to your appliance graveyard, this is the next step for you.</li>
    <li> I gave it a try because I thought it would be nice to have something without battery&#x27;s. It was also made in the USA and I like to support domestic jobs. It does fine except in the tight spots and it will leave the occasional stragglers behind. I don&#x27;t like how they have word minimums for the reviews.</li>
    <li> It trims nose hair very well according to my husband, but it is hard to use on ear hair.  He likes the ease in cleaning and no need for batteries.</li>
    <li> One of the few truly quality products, in a global market-place full of garbage and disposable items. I own two.</li>
    <li> The best thing about it is you will no longer have to worry about the dinky motor crapping out on you between trimmings, which I&#x27;ve experienced with literally EVERY other nose/ear trimmer I&#x27;ve owned in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tradeoff . . . if you aren&#x27;t so dextrous as to keep this thing spinning at 100 rpms for the entirety of your grooming procedure, a nose hair will get caught, and you will be FORCED to pull it out . . . and that doesn&#x27;t feel good at all.</li>
    <li> very happy with this so far! have only used one time so far but  worked great, quick and easy. very happy!</li>
    <li> Stick with the battery operated kind, this isn&#x27;t worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt&#x27; seem to cut as aggressive as a battery unit.</li>
    <li> Great product and bought another one as a gift for a family member.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a small, cheap, and battery-less nose trimmer.  Fantastic product with a lifetime guarantee.</li>
    <li> I bought this thing cause I wanted to look more clean and professional. Today I saw one of my supervisors and saw the giant hairs sticking out of his nose. Made me kind of feel bad for him and tell him about this thing, but it will remain my secret ;) A must in every professional males bathroom.</li>
    <li> Great U.S. made product.  I&#x27;ve had it for 4 years now and it still works great!</li>
    <li> But, the manufacturer of this one deserves accolades.  It is a sturdy, hefty little thing, maneuvers easily (in nose and ears), and cuts closely and thoroughly.  I&#x27;ve never found an electric one that works well, and was inconvenienced by how often batteries had to be replaced (only to find the interior corroded, probably because of the moist environment provided by bathrooms).  As for other non-electric trimmers, the only other variety I have seen requires a pinching action of the thumb and forefinger (or some finger) to clip.  However, that pinching action causes the blades to actually deflect away from the target, or else significant practice to perfect the technique).  This one, not at all; one hand holds the nicely knurled barrel of the trimmer near the nose or ear, and the other hand twists the knurled grip at the other end.  The action is smooth and (as mentioned) the product is sturdy and hefty (considering its diminutive size), resulting in easy maneuvering and a precise cut.  I am glad to have discovered this product, and encourage others to give it a shot.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great. The electric trimmer I had would loose power then jam, hair would be caught and I could only pull on it.  With this manual trimmer when you feel it pulling just twist harder to cut the hair. You can easily create more torque than an electric.  Keep the blades moving and it only pulls a little.  Just go slow and work it around.  I use it while watching TV and don&#x27;t pull on it if I feel a pinch.  I just keep rotating it to cut the hair, then move it with no pinching. Follow the directions and only rotate the end opposite the blades while holding the blade end steady.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice this was non-electric (no batteries) and purchased it for my 91 year old father.  He is a little shakey and so holding it and twisting the bottom is not an easy task.  I will be purchasing a battery operated one for him.  My husband used it ok and it seems to work ok. It&#x27;s just a little cumbersome.</li>
    <li> Shoving anything sharp up your nose is a pretty scary thing to do, but it does help to know that it&#x27;s not an electrically powered with a motor that can possibly fling a shrapnel up into the passage.  And I read that the other manual kind with spring inside can also break suddenly and slit inside your nose.  (ugh...)  So glad this one has no springing action anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, it does trim my hair nicely and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  I do have to say that it&#x27;s unnecessarily heavy and a bit too small for comfort when turning to trim.&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: It still can cause a pain if you pull out the trimmer before completely trimming off the hair because hair will get caught wedged between the rotating blade and you will yank out your hair instead.&lt;br /&gt;It might be the way it trims the hair though, my nose hair hasn&#x27;t been growing back in a way to irritate me since I trimmed it last time, which was about 2 months ago.  Very convenient tool, I&#x27;d say.</li>
    <li> It does a great job and does it with very little effort. Just follow the instructions and you will be happy. Would highly recommend</li>
    <li> This is the perfect personal groomer- no batteries needed. You can travel with this small trimmer without having to remember the batteries!</li>
    <li> it helps, but still need scissors as well, I was hoping one tool could take care of all that, but it doesnt hurt like other ones do.</li>
    <li> simple design that works as promised. Cleans up easily. Just wish is was powered instead of needing manual effort to use.</li>
    <li> No no no good at all gets one nose hair every 5 tries worse trimmers ever wow must of bin made in a garage lol well if I was him i would stop selling cheap stuff on amazon</li>
    <li> ....maybe it is me, but I cannot get these things to clip hair.  They pull it out after a few tries.  Is there a trick to it???</li>
    <li> This thing is not for those who can&#x27;t handle a little pain.. No matter how fast you spin the thing it will eventually grab at a hair and u better be prepared.. It will hurt.. This is a no fuss no gentleness about it torture tool for nose hair.. Make no mistake. It will remove hair and does so better than other battery powered trimmers but you pay for it in pain.. I still only use it becaus my battery operated one keeled over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend ? Well for the price and fact it requires no batteries, sure.. If you can handle the pain..</li>
    <li> Product does not cut shorter hairs and does not get to hairs in certain areas of the nose as other solutions.</li>
    <li> did not work..pull hair out..</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Compact and highly effective, no batteries needed.  A smart and efficient purchase.  I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tony</li>
    <li> very high quality item. easy to use easy to clean. works better than electric no annoying sound or vibrating blades in your nostril. will have this for a lifetime instead of buying an electric one  every year.</li>
