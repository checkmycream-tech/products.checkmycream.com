      <li>Works quickly and well.</li>
      <li>Based on my experience, it is by far the most effective facial hair remover on the marker, in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>I love it, especially for the course gray hair.  </li>
      <li>Laser removal does not work because many of the hairs are white.  </li>
      <li>I found this item worked very well.</li>
      <li>It was very time consuming.  </li>
      <li>It burned after I washed the cream off and it didn&#x27;t remove the hair as much as I was hoping.</li>
      <li>This is a gentle cream and does not have the strong odor other hair removers do.</li>
      <li>The smell is not unpleasant and it does remove unwanted facial hair.</li>
      <li>I am a 14 year old African American girl with light brown skin, this product is so gentle, does not burn or darken application areas at all.</li>
      <li>This was my first time using a dipilatory on my upper lip, so I followed the instructions to the letter.  </li>
      <li>I tried it on my chin first and after no irritation tried it on my upper lip.  </li>
      <li>You really do not have to leave it on long to make sure all the hair will be removed.  </li>
      <li>I washed it off and hardly any hair was removed, and now my upper lip is bright red and feels like it&#x27;s on fire.  </li>
      <li>I am 65 years old and have been fighting chin hairs all my life.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fairly easy to remove, and if you wish, you can apply a small amount of the soothing cream after the removal process.  </li>
      <li>Very easy, little mess, takes only minutes.</li>
      <li>This actually works and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only tried it once so far.</li>
      <li>Using it, the facial hair seems to grow back more slowly than if you just pluck.</li>

<li> So until I found Andrea, I spent hours weekly daily with tweezers.&lt;br</li>
<li> It removed no hair, even though I followed the directions carefully and left it on for the maximum time recommended.</li>
<li> The other products left my skin looking rough and prickly.</li>
<li> (a tip I learned from reading other reviews).</li>
<li> Nair and others, do not remove the thick, coarse hairs.  </li>
<li> hair was still left- not good</li>
<li> I was so excited to try this based on the reviews, and was very quickly disappointed.  </li>
<li> Other products ive used would sometimes cause breakouts, but not this!!</li>
<li> As instructed, don&#x27;t keep the product on longer than the directions state (think it&#x27;s no more than 8 minutes).  </li>
<li> The directions say to leave it on for 8 minutes, and I would never go past 8 1/2 or 9 minutes.  </li>
<li> The other cream from the drugstore always leaves hair behind but not this one.</li>
<li> It stung a little bit but not any worse than others I have used.</li>
<li> Poor buy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t remove any hair and left my skin red and it hurt.</li>
    <li> I found this item worked very well. I put it on for 7 1/2 minutes and washed it off and the facial hair was gone. It stung a little bit but not any worse than others I have used. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am a 14 year old African American girl with light brown skin, this product is so gentle, does not burn or darken application areas at all.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using a dipilatory on my upper lip, so I followed the instructions to the letter.  It calls for 6-8 minutes;  I checked at 6 minutes and hair wasn&#x27;t coming off.  I left it til 8 minutes and the hair was totally removed, but I had some tenderness and redness to my skin for a day or so.  Next time I will try 7 minutes and also maybe applying some vaseline on the area beforehand (a tip I learned from reading other reviews).</li>
    <li> Very gentle!! Other products ive used would sometimes cause breakouts, but not this!! So happy i purchased this, this bottle will last forever!! Great product, great value!</li>
    <li> I love it, especially for the course gray hair.  My skin is actually more smooth than before around my chin.  The other products left my skin looking rough and prickly. You really do not have to leave it on long to make sure all the hair will be removed.  If you do, it will begin to sting. This is a fantastic product, I will continually purchase it and hope it is never discontinued.</li>
    <li> did not do a great job- followed directions- hair was still left- not good</li>
    <li> This works pretty good. Used as directed, there is no burning or itching after using the product. The smell is not unpleasant and it does remove unwanted facial hair.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this based on the reviews, and was very quickly disappointed.  I tried it on my chin first and after no irritation tried it on my upper lip.  Within 5 minutes my lip was BURNING.  I washed it off and hardly any hair was removed, and now my upper lip is bright red and feels like it&#x27;s on fire.  Would not recommend, and will not use again.</li>
    <li> It removed no hair, even though I followed the directions carefully and left it on for the maximum time recommended.</li>
    <li> I am 65 years old and have been fighting chin hairs all my life.  I have tried everything, electrolysis kept going and going and going.  It was very time consuming.  Laser removal does not work because many of the hairs are white.  Nair and others, do not remove the thick, coarse hairs.  I have tried epilators, but I can&#x27;t stand to grow the hair out enough for it to even begin to work.  So until I found Andrea, I spent hours weekly daily with tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have no idea how exciting this is for me!!</li>
    <li> Works awesome! The other cream from the drugstore always leaves hair behind but not this one. I will continue buying.</li>
    <li> Simply did nothing. Poor buy.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer I ever had!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried it once so far. It burned after I washed the cream off and it didn&#x27;t remove the hair as much as I was hoping.</li>
    <li> works better than most I have tried/ I still have to use tweezers on some hairs over top lip. I Have to use about once a week. No itching or skin rashes , so I will probably order again when I need it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. Very easy, little mess, takes only minutes. Very effective.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years.  Great product for those of us with sensitive skin.  As instructed, don&#x27;t keep the product on longer than the directions state (think it&#x27;s no more than 8 minutes).  Works like a charm.  Nice smooth skin, fuzz free!</li>
    <li> This is a gentle cream and does not have the strong odor other hair removers do. It works great!</li>
    <li> Did not remove any face hair, also irratated my skin.</li>
    <li> Works quickly and well. Using it, the facial hair seems to grow back more slowly than if you just pluck.</li>
    <li> This actually works and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  I will order it again.</li>
    <li> I cannot find this product in stores any longer, so I order it from Amazon.  Based on my experience, it is by far the most effective facial hair remover on the marker, in my opinion.  When you follow the directions precisely, there is virtually no redness or skin irritation.  The directions say to leave it on for 8 minutes, and I would never go past 8 1/2 or 9 minutes.  It&#x27;s fairly easy to remove, and if you wish, you can apply a small amount of the soothing cream after the removal process.  I find that weekly use of the product is sufficient.  I am so glad that this product is available for purchase on Amazon, since I can no longer get it at the supermarket, drug store, or health and beauty stores.</li>
