<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Zero stars. I should have listened to other reviewers. Stopped charging after only a few months of use.  UPDATE 10/21/15: I have already had to have the handle replaced twice, both times it stopped holding a charge after exactly 5 months. It&#x27;s obviously not designed to last. Both times I have had to spend an hour on hold, pay for the shipment back to the service center, and wait weeks. Moreover, the warranty on repairs is only 3 months, even though they claim a warranty of 2 years.</li>
    <li> wife loved it.  Much better than traditional brushing, much better price than if you buy in store.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush cleans so much better than my old Oral B power brush!</li>
    <li> With Parkinson&#x27;s Disease, shaky hands do not lead to a good brushing.  I&#x27;ve bought Oral-B toothbrushes because of their good brushing bristles and I am glad I stuck with the brand!</li>
    <li> The reason i gave this 4 star is because of the weak battery. It drains so fast after several months of usage. Other than that, this toothbrush rocks!</li>
    <li> This is my second Oral-B &#x27;Electric&#x27; toothbrush.  I think the circular rotating head is the best tech for teeth brushing.  This particular model is rated &#x27;Excellent&#x27; by Consumer Reports(tm).  Its better than the previous version I owned, which was a lower-numbered model.  In particular, I feel the charging station design has been improved a lot.  Its now easier to clean the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have an issue, its with cleaning the toothbrush.  I rinse it thoroughly after every usage.  No matter how well I rinse it, or dissemble and rinse it, toothpaste/saliva residue is found on the charger.  (Not the best sight.)  In addition, I find the price of the heads, particularly the &#x27;Flossing Head&#x27; to be extortionate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, this model looks to have the same design as my last Oral-B. My last Oral-B, just seized-up, and stopped working. I expect toothpaste laden saliva will also eventually work its way under the &#x27;Blue Collar&#x27; on the toothbrush handle and seize-up this one too.  I hope to get at least the same usage out of it, before it fails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, the best electric toothbrush, but not perfect.  I have issues with being unable to completely clean it to avoid counter mess and failure of the device, and the price of the heads.</li>
    <li> Some of the features on the brush are overkill. Definitely glad I didn&#x27;t buy the even more expensive model. My teeth feel cleaner.</li>
    <li> my new dentist recently chastised me for using a battery-powered toothbrush; said they didn&#x27;t clean as well because not as powerful.  He recommended the Oral-B 5000, but it seemed to have too many bells and whistles for me.  He said the most important thing was getting one with circular motion, not &amp;#34;back and forth&amp;#34;.  This model has the &amp;#34;spinning&amp;#34; motion and was over $30 cheaper than the 5000, so I grabbed it.  I must say, my teeth always feel like I just came from the dentist for me, and I do brush longer now that I have the &amp;#34;beeps&amp;#34; that remind you to move to another section of your mouth.  The charge lasts about a week and a half for me (single user; unit not shared with anyone).  Glad I made this investment.</li>
    <li> Have had other electric tooth brushes in the past and believe I finally found one I truly like.  Would reccomend this product</li>
    <li> Pros: Makes my life easier, keeps the dentist pleased about my teeth, makes them squeaky clean, and has nice modes to brush the gums too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Travel case is bulky, not entirely sure why it has to be so big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Buy.</li>
    <li> Nice solid unit with compact charger. Same unit as the next model up minus the fancy functions and the high price.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush. It really does get your teeth cleaner than the convential toothbrush! :)</li>
    <li> I guess I should have listened to Great Dad and some of the other reviewers who said they did not get the Smart Series 4000 which was advertised as having 3 brush heads and 5 brush modes.  Also if I&#x27;m not mistaken, the SmartSeries has a digital clock. Of course I don&#x27;t know this for sure because what I got was not the SmartSeries.    I received my Oral B electric toothbrush 5 days ago.  It came in a sealed box that says SmartSeries 4000 on it.  However, the box says it has 2 brush heads and 4 brush modes.  And when I looked at the toothbrush itself, it says Triumph Professional Care on it!!  I can&#x27;t believe they can get away with that.  However, after thinking it over I have decided to keep it.  I don&#x27;t blame Amazon.  I know they would gladly refund my money if I wanted to return the item because it wasn&#x27;t as expected.  But I got it for a good price and I guess I can live without the 3rd brush and the other updates I thought I was getting.    This does not make me happy with Oral B.  Even though I like the toothbrush I can&#x27;t get over the fact that Oral B would pack the old model in the new box. Isn&#x27;t there a law against that?  There certainly should be.</li>
    <li> Sure it&#x27;s loud and is priced awfully high for a \\&quot;toothbrush\\&quot;. Hey do a cost benefit analysis. Take care of your teeth and no high cost dental bills, oh and the pain, yikes... This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had!!!</li>
    <li> This unit is PERFECT!  It &amp;#34;beeps&amp;#34; 3 different times. One when you&#x27;ve brushed each area for the time it suggest and if you&#x27;re brushing too long in a given area.</li>
    <li> I recevied a Triumph Model 3745 in my box instead of the SmartSeries 4000.  Is it a bait and switch?  I will be returning.</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t want to go back to any other type of toothbrush. A total steal with the 50% off promotion plus the $15 dentist visit refund that comes in the box - all told, an awesome toothbrush for &lt; $40.</li>
    <li> I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for many years and I have been satisfied with it. But after checking the Consumer Reports electric toothbrush ratings, which recommended both the high-end Sonicare and Oral-B brushes, I decided to give the Oral-B 4000 toothbrush with its 60 day, money-back guarantee a try. Wow! am I glad I did. I liked my Sonicare but I LOVE my Oral-B. In my opinion it is easier to use and does a better cleaning job. I also appreciate the several types (four, I think) of brush-heads that are available. I have always had good feedback from my dental hygienist while using the Sonicare but I expect even better reports now that I am using Oral-B 4000.    Update: My wife has purchased a 3000 series Oral-b toothbrush and I have compared it to my 4000 series model. I like hers better! No, it does not have the little (useless) view screen to tell me what mode the unit is in and a charge remaining indicator. Who needs them. The 3000 series flashes a red light when the battery is low (really all I need to know). I also find her unit&#x27;s smaller handle to be more comfortable and easier to use. Both models apparently have the same motor/brushing unit and use the same brush heads. So I&#x27;m jealous of my wife&#x27;s less expensive 3000 model but I guess I will just have to love my 4000. After all, they both do an excellent job of cleaning our teeth.    So I changed my rating from 5 to 4 stars. I would rate the 3000 series models as 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush - gives me that dentist clean feeling.  Unfortunantly, difficult to find replacement heads (at least the one I want).  I have confidence my next dental checkup will be positive.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Sonic elite that had a very long life. The Oral-B is noisier than the Sonic but much easier to keep clean. So while they both are great brands, I give the Oral-B the edge.</li>
    <li> yea, so i&#x27;m EXTREMELY picky about oral hygiene....i&#x27;m 30 and have never had a cavity so yup i&#x27;m pretty picky with what i use.  i had 2 other electrical toothbrushes previous to this all being oral b. the first one died so i picked up the oral-b vitality which was about 30 something bucks. it did the job well but died after a year or less, which was disappointing, and it didn&#x27;t charge well. but if you&#x27;re looking for a cheaper alternative than the oral-b 4000 then you can go with the vitality. i used it and after using the 4000 it seems to have the same amount of oscilation.......i don&#x27;t know if it does as i haven&#x27;t looked at the specs of the vitality, but i never got any negative check-ups with my dentist when using the vitality. although, i don&#x27;t use it for the 2 minutes that they state is enough, i tend to brush longer. in regards to the 4000 it&#x27;s a nice toothbrush. it gets the job done and i like the fact that it has 4 settings (regular, sensitive, polishing, and deep clean) i use deep clean and polishing and yup after my brush my teeth definately are shiny. it also does reach all the way back to my wisdom teeth area with no problem, yes i still have my wisdom teeth, lol. and i&#x27;m able to brush my tongue with it too. i think i read before that someone said this was messy and splashy, but i didn&#x27;t have that problem at all. when i want to change settings i just put the toothbrush low into the sink and change the setting so that it doesn&#x27;t splash toothpaste everywhere. but all in all i dont have anything negative to say about this brush. i get a great cleaning, reaches my wisdom teeth area, and i&#x27;m able to brush my tongue with it aaaaaaaand it comes with a 2 year warranty so it gets an a+ from me :)</li>
    <li> Bought these for my wife and I.  We had previously been using the Oral-B Sonic tooth brushes, and switched to these because genuine Oral-B brushes were no longer available for the models we had.  These new brushes are purely a mechanical &amp;#34;scrubbing action.&amp;#34;  They do not clean as well as the sonic brushes and do not massage the gums as well.  After owning them for several months, my mouth does not feel as &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; or healthy as with the sonic units despite the same brushing schedule.  That being said we are switching back to the sonic technology.</li>
    <li> I just got my $45.00 visa credit card rebate and thought that I would tell you about this amazing tooth brush.  My teeth feels SO clean and my gums feel so much more healthier since I started using this toothbrush.  I have been converted from the phillips sonicare Es5500.  I use to really like the phillips until i went to change the heads one day and found mold inside of the toothbrush handle and yucky liquids.  I was totally grossed out but then I brought a plastic cover for it and it really helped to block that yuck out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Amazon was running a rebate to try this toothbrush I said ahh what the heck.  Best buy of the year for me.  I love the oral B 4000.  It comes with a blue travel case and 1 brush head with 2 rings and a charger.  At first I was not use to using a small brush head.  But it is really great for my teeth.  My teeth has not felt this clean in years.  I smile so much now and I am more confident because I know my mouth is super clean.  The handle has a button for different brush style i.e. sensitive, or extra clean mode.  If you brush your teeth for 2 minutes then you get a smiley face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is highly recommended.  I am still smiling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*although I still think that this toothbrush is great.  I am having issues with the battery life.  I have had it for almost a month and about every week and a half it needs to be charged.  It will shut off and NOT work at all so you have to charge it.  Coming from my Phillips Sonicare- it will only blink but it will keep working.  The oral-b completely shuts off.  So the battery life is very short.  You will get maybe 8-10 brushes on a charge. I am not liking that one thing very much.</li>
    <li> Oral-B is a dependable brand and this is my second one.  It works great, doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on the bathroom counter and multiple brushes can be stored conveniently.</li>
    <li> Went with the Oral B after the recommendation by my dentist. This is a very nice model. Am completely pleased with my selection.</li>
    <li> I like this, but I think it&#x27;s whitening claims are overstated.</li>
    <li> Wow! I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed with this toothbrush.  I feel like I never knew what having and clean/fresh mouth felt like until I tried this toothbrush. The feeling I had in my mouth after one brush felt so odd and unique.  I later realized that this is the feeling having clean teeth, totally free from plaque.   As dorky as it sounds, this toothbrush has added a level of excitement to this otherwise mundane activity. I find myself looking forward to my evening brush because my mouth just feels nasty, just yearning for a cleaning, a couple hours before bedtime.  I never even noticed this issue when using a regular toothbrush (probably because i never knew what it felt like to have a totally clean mouth)  It&#x27;s going to take some time for me to get used to not taking the brush out of my mouth for the entire duration of a brush.  The head vibrates quite violently, causing foamy toothpaste to fly all over your bathroom if you don&#x27;t keep the brush inside your mouth.  Regardless, I feel like i&#x27;m leaving my dentist&#x27;s office every time I brush, making this minor inconvenience well worth it!</li>
    <li> The current model of this toothbrush is the one with the full LED screen. However, the one I received has the images on the grey background. The toothbrush itself is also labeled \\&quot;Triumph\\&quot;. This is the old (2010) version of the toothbrush. Amazon had me return the toothbrush and sent out a replacement but the replacement was the same exact thing. It seems some people have been able to get the current, correct model but I was not so lucky. I returned it.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is far superior to the brush that I previously used.  Best features are (1) timer which allows me to be consistent on brushing different areas, (2) replaceable battery which should extend the machine&#x27;s life versus non replaceable batteries, (3) nice rigid travel case, and (4) cheaper replacement brush heads (my prior heads cost $16).</li>
    <li> Second oral B I have owned. I really like the optionsong with the 5000.</li>
    <li> Braun 4000 electric toothbrush is fantastic and powerful. I thought our prior model was fine and lasted 15-20 years, but the new Oral B 4000 model was highly rated by Consumer reports and now by us.</li>
    <li> I used to have the battery operated toothbrush until it finally gave out.  I haven&#x27;t tried all the brushing options.  The charging station is a great place to store your brushes.  When you keep them on the motor, the brush and motor can get gunky.  With my battery operated one, I would have to seperate them and clean daily with no place to store them.  The charging station fits in my medicine cabinet and is out of the way.</li>
    <li> Great electric brush!</li>
    <li> Good product.  Wish I had got it sooner.</li>
    <li> I had the Sonicare prior to this Oral B but it finally gave out.  Consumer Reports gave the Oral B the edge so I decided to try it.  The Oral B has a much stronger feel and seems to do a good job.  It just doesn&#x27;t give me the \\&quot;dentist visit\\&quot; type of cleaning like my old Sonicare.  Having had the unit for only a few weeks, I&#x27;ll keep on using it until my next dentist visit and have her decide!</li>
    <li> A very good buy.  I will never go back to a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> As a long-standing, satisfied consumer of Braun electric razors and Oral-B toothbrushes, this purchase was a natural decision for me.    I used the toothbrush without issue for the first year and then experienced some problems with the on/off button, having to push much harder than usual. This soon became significant when I couldn&#x27;t turn it off without letting the charge completely deplete or turn it on without really leaning on the button.    When I called the customer support number listed on the Oral-B Website, they said that without a receipt, they had to go by the manufactured date for the brush. Basically, the two year warranty was expired since the product apparently sat around for a year before it was sold.    My words of warning:   1. ) this product has the potential for a critical flaw  2.) if you must buy it, better keep your receipt for the first two years</li>
    <li> This brushing action is faster and probably more effective than previous models, and certainly better than the competition.&lt;br /&gt;What is not good:&lt;br /&gt;1. No place to store the brush heads as on previous models.&lt;br /&gt;2. Heavy plug/transformer sticks straight out from the outlet and tends to fall off.&lt;br /&gt;3. Cord on charger/base sticks out the back preventing pushing it back against the wall.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush and features. Works like a charm and provides great teeth cleaning. Has a quality feel matched by its performance.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an upgrade from my previous Oral-B toothbrush which I&#x27;ve had for 5 or so years.  It was well worth the investment; I now look forward to brushing my teeth.</li>
    <li> First, the toothbrush:  Excellent, excellent cleaning; it feels like you&#x27;ve just left the dentist office.  Honestly, I can&#x27;t say anything bad about the toothbrush itself.  What bothers me, is there is nowhere to store the brush heads!  In the ads on Oral B&#x27;s website, it clearly shows a side case that accommodates 4 brush heads; this does not come with that attachment, even though it&#x27;s the same model number.  Right now we&#x27;re keeping the brush heads in a cup along side the wand in the charger; it&#x27;s awkward and feels incomplete.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It really cleans your teeth well.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it every morning and night. I definitely brush longer and more often because I look forward to it.  I&#x27;m addicted to this toothbrush!</li>
    <li> I upgraded to this toothbrush from Oral-b Professional care, which I had for more than two years. Although, the previous one was good this one is great! I love the better flossing action. It does a much better job of cleaning in between the teeth.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement of my old Oral-B. It seems to clean better in short time. Only part I did not like was Amazon charged me for delivery.</li>
    <li> I tried some of the original sonicare electric toothbrushes a few years back and felt that they were more of a gimmick but these latest oral-b brushes are great.  I got the SmartSeries 4000 for myself and bought some extra heads so my wife could try it out as well.  She loves the clean feel as much as i do, and subsequently i purchased her own smartseries for her so she has the flexibility to travel and doesn&#x27;t have to share my base.  The size and scrubbing motion of the &#x27;cupping/floss-action&#x27; toothbrush is great, it maneuvers well to cover all surfaces of each tooth.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does a great job of cleaning teeth, while being gentle on gums.  The automatic timer helps shorten the time spent brushing, which is important for me with my receding gums (this is the reason I invested in an electric toothbrush in the first place.)  My only complaint is that the toothbrush is rather loud; the sound generated by the vibration seems to resonate through my whole head.  I certainly can&#x27;t carry on a conversation while brushing as all I can hear is the toothbrush.  I&#x27;m happy to put up with this, though, as the condition of my teeth and gums is more important to me than some bothersome noise.</li>
    <li> Received this item quickly and very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Works quite well. I had a Phillips Sonicare and its vibration was annoying. The Oral B is an improvement.</li>
    <li> Excellent product great price much more expensive at the stores here. I loved it have not stopped using it. It is so great on my teeth and gums and is perfect for everyday and helps me brushing for the amount of time that i need..Shipping was fast too very impressed with the product thanks Amazon for your great products online and fast service would do business again soon.. THANKS!! A+++</li>
    <li> Solid electric toothbrush.  Many modes,  teeth were noticeably whiter after 2 weeks.  Great investment</li>
    <li> What a great shopping experience. Not only was I able to select from a wide array of products, but including shipping, the Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 4000 Rechargeable Toothbrush, was still less expensive than in any of the stores. Thank you amazon.com, you&#x27;ve made me very happy.    Regards,  G. Bowes</li>
    <li> The order was shipped quickly and the merchandise was EXACTLY as described.  Great job!!</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush it was expensive but well worth the money.  Within no time my teeth were whiter and this gives me instant feedback to keep using it.  The timer is awesome, i don&#x27;t think i actually brushed for 2 minutes in my life.  My gums feel better along with my teeth being whiter.  The stand is simple and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  it feels comfortable in your hand and the battery lasts long enough to take on a weekend trip, not sure more then that haven&#x27;t tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides are that it is a little loud and obviously it is expensive but the value is there.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush works well.  I like the \\&quot;Smiley Face\\&quot; time indicator.  Easy to charge.</li>
    <li> Great product! I especially like the \\&quot;smiley\\&quot; face that appears when you&#x27;ve brushed the minimum amount of time.  I also like the icon that appears that shows if you are not applying enough pressure while brushing. Both of these features make sure you&#x27;re really doing a great job of brushing to ensure good dental hygiene and care!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an old Cybersonic toothbrush (as seen on tv) that worked amazingly well for 6 years. When that broke, I bought a cheap (in quality) $20 electric toothbrush from CVS which broke within 2 months, the power button stopped functioning properly.    The Oral-B 4000 is great, especially since Amazon was having a sale and Oral-B had a 50% off rebate. I probably would not have bought it otherwise. The LCD screen is useful for selecting one of the 4 modes, although I only use the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; and \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; modes. Some mornings I don&#x27;t want my entire skull to vibrate so the sensitive mode comes in handy.    I don&#x27;t like the included brush heads, one \\&quot;floss action\\&quot; and one \\&quot;whitening\\&quot;. I bought a 3-pack of the \\&quot;dual clean\\&quot; heads (again, big sale on Amazon, regular price is way too much) and that works really well.</li>
    <li> The rebate by Oral B pushed me to buy this item.  Glad I did.  Does a much better job than brushing by hand.</li>
    <li> Replaced an old electronic toothbrush that i had with this new model and I love it.  Great battery life and powerful.  Well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing.  There are just enough features to make it worthwhile, but not so many bells/whistles that it is a pain to operate.  The smiley face that appears when you finish the two minute cycle is very cool, and makes me feel like I accomplished something!  My teeth look whiter and feel cleaner.</li>
    <li> I have always had periodontal disease. I practiced good oral hygiene and still had periodontal disease. Now that I am retired and taking medications, the periodontal problems have increased. In 2 weeks after purchasing the Professional Oral B toothbrush I went to my dentist and had a good improvement of gum line and no cavities. I do not want to have to have dentures so am glad to have an aide like Oral B to assist me in keeping my diseased gums from progressing to the point of dentures.</li>
    <li> Replaced older Braun device with this one, works very well, charging stand is like a circle, meaning tooth brush device sits inside charging ring, so no more water collection in the charging device. Comes with two brush heads, one for cleaning, one for polishing, has nice battery indicator on it.</li>
    <li> Excellent, top quality</li>
    <li> First time owner of an electric toothbrush and this was an excellent choice. I love the two speeds and the two different brush heads. The brush recommended for everyday use is the flossing head, the other one is for polishing. My teeth feel great! ...although my gums were a little sore at first, they were fine after a just a few days. I am looking forward to a good report from the dentist at my next visit. He always comments on plaque build up and I&#x27;m thinking this will really help. His hygienist actually recommended an electric toothbrush and a water pick, so I got both and I&#x27;m happy with the ones I chose.     I also love that this toothbrush comes with a travel case. Really convenient. I keep it standing on the counter top and love that it takes up hardly any space.</li>
    <li> Awesome, unbelievable!!!!!  Feels like you have just left the dentist&#x27;s office after each use.  The ability to specifically choose the type of brush head for your teeth is great!</li>
    <li> I just purchased this oral b pro 4000. Amazon says its supposed to come with 3 brush heads but it only came with 2 (floss, whitening), supposed to come with a cover for the brush but none was included. Travel case is included though. I am very disappointed. After searching for the perfect one, I chose this one cuz it had everything I was looking for...3 brush heads, travel case, cover for brush head. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet since I just got it. Hopefully it won&#x27;t be disappointing. I did call Amazon back and got a $10 credit.</li>
    <li> This is a really good toothbrush.  It is powerful and easy to use and I like that it offers various levels of brushing</li>
    <li> My last Oral-B stop running so I needed to replace it.  When I looked at Amazon.com it was cheaper than the other companies that I jumped on it and been happy ever since.  Plus I&#x27;ve gotten good reports from my Dentists and they cut my visits down.</li>
    <li> I use to use the Sonicare HX6911-02 FlexCare and I have to say...there is no comparison between the two.  I guess the price tag explain it though.  The sonicare was definitely alot better in quality, movement, functionality etc.  BUT, with that said, IF you are coming from using a manual toothbrush or a cheaper version of an electrical tooth brush, this would do the job in cleaning your teeth well and you prob. would love the experience.  The oral b toothbrush still does a decent job in cleaning your teeth but the way this vibrates, I almost feel like it goes to my head and gives me a uncomfortable shake.  The sonicare vibrates much faster,stronger, yet smoother and doesnt give this kind of feeling.      This device is also awkwardly big, and the buttons look like plastic toys in comparison to the sonicare flexcare. Definitly a difference there!  another reviewer complained about the design, and i have to agree..this isn&#x27;t a fancy looking piece electronic by any means.  Can&#x27;t complain given the 50% rebate price tag though.      Another reviewer noted that the 3000 version was better...and...I totally AGREE!  Its sleeker in design, smaller, and has almost identicle functions aside from not having a bigger display on the tooth brush...which...basically is useless since you cant see it during your brushing so you dont see the timer, the happy face (after 2 min.), the brush mode etc.  Whats the point then???  Might as well have a smaller brush and use the vibrations to tell the time etc.     I&#x27;m returning this model and either getting the 3000 ..OR...back to my sonicare flexcare,,, $40 bucks more for 2 years of use doesnt sound too bad after all.</li>
    <li> I used to have the Oral-B ProfessionalCare SmartSeries 5000 with SmartGuide Electric Toothbrush.  I decided to save some money and get this one.  I have to admit I miss the smart guide.  This version has a small screen on the toothbrush but you can&#x27;t see it while you&#x27;re brushing (so the symbol that shows if you&#x27;re brushing too hard isn&#x27;t very useful.)  I also just like the smiley face and bigger smiley face and huge smiley face progression on the smart guide (as you brush longer.)  I think it encourages kids to keep brushing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had anice electric toothbrush but this works great I feel my teeth are cleaner than with a manual toothbrush</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush! It does take some getting used to, a week or more... but I really like it. I wish it came with bigger brush heads, but they can be purchased seperatly...</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.  The timer function is great and actually keeps me brushing until the 2 (or 3) minutes are up!  My gums are in better condition than they were before when I was using a manual toothbrush.  This makes flossing easier too!  My only complaint is that it causes my husband to spray toothpaste all over the mirror and bathroom counter!  Don&#x27;t forget to turn on AFTER putting brush in mouth and turn off BEFORE removing brush from mouth to avoid this.</li>
    <li> ordered this with the discount and rebate. I have yet to get the rebate however, being that this is my first automatic toothbrush, I love it. Saves my hand the trouble and i&#x27;m left feeling that my teeth have been thoroughly cleaned better than what i could do manually. Battery life seems good and the built in timer is excellent.</li>
    <li> Replaced my Sonicare at the suggestion of my dentist. I am very happy I did. Gets my teeth cleaner than ever before.  GMR</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for our old Oral B and in that sense it works fine.  Two minute timer, broken up into 4 30-second intervals help ensure you are brushing for as long as the dentist always tells you to!  My gripe is that the toothbrush I got is not the one that Amazon was displaying (at the time)as the SmartSeries 4000.  It may sound silly, but one of the reasons I specifically bought this product was because of the clock.  My bathroom doesn&#x27;t have one and the idea I could save counter-clutter by having a clock on my electric toothbrush was appealing to me.  In the product details it specifically says (and I quote) \\&quot;Digital clock: Acts as a clock when not in use\\&quot;.  Inside the packaging for the SmartSeries 4000 was another model - a Triumph and no clock.  I kept it as my husband liked it and it has worked fine.  But beware - this one does not have the clock.    PS - I noticed that although they have changed the picture on Amazon, the description still says it has a clock.  I wish I had read more of these reviews before I purchased...</li>
    <li> Bought this as a replacement for my husband when his broke. He is very happy with it. It takes up more counters pace than his previous one. That would be my only complaint. For the price this one was a great deal and we&#x27;ll worth the money.</li>
    <li> excellent, thorough cleaning, i use the \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brush heads (purchased separately) because of gum recession, and overall am very happy with the brush. just rinse after each use. super easy to clean. highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t praise this product enough. Ergonomic design and intuitive features make this toothbrush a breeze to use. The recommended two minutes of brushing fly by and I am able to clean all around my teeth. They look whiter than ever before:-)  [...]</li>
    <li> As another reviewer said, what I got was a different version of the toothbrush in a 4000 professional box. This doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a bad toothbrush, or even a bad deal. Just be aware that you may get the triumph version of the product.    That said, I use it everyday and think it is a good upgrade to the basic electric brush I used before.</li>
    <li> I had a OralB CrossAction before this that was a good clean for starters. This toothbrush though cleans more thoroughly and faster over even a good powerbrush. The timer is not a beep but pulses in the toothbrush which one will get used to. To change the between modes it is difficult to do without toothpaste spinning everywhere since the brush has to be on so one has to remember how many presses for each mode. The toothbrush won&#x27;t overcharge its battery with a small charging stand but bulky plug adapter. The travel case is very nice even though large for the brush; its design is innovative for travel with moisture release vents that&#x27;s recommended for proper drying so bacteria growth is prevented.</li>
    <li> Having used an Oral-B rechargeable for the last 8 years, I was expecting a tool that was reasonably quiet and highly effective at cleaning.  What I got was a tool that&#x27;s a sort of cross between a sonic screwdriver and a jackhammer.  Even when the toothbrush is set to its gentlest cycle, it&#x27;s noise and action is very uncomfortable. When compared to my earlier brush, it is significantly less effective in removing tartar (I&#x27;m buying different brush heads, so maybe those will help).  The plug on the power cord for this new unit extends about three inches from the wall... bad design for a crowded bathroom.  The base is just a simple ring that, while easier to clean than the old charger base, lacks storage for extra brushes (those just lay around and get messy, I guess).  This isn&#x27;t the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.  -----  It&#x27;s now a month later.  Changing brush heads didn&#x27;t help.  I&#x27;m changing this from a two-star rating to just one-start.  My wife bought a Remington that works much better.  Live and learn.</li>
    <li> A very good electric toothbrush.  Only disappointed that previous one of two purchased had to be replaced because it would not hold a charge.  The other is working well.</li>
    <li> I got the toothbrush but it doesn&#x27;t have the receipt. Can I print the final detail for order as a receipt? Thank you very much</li>
    <li> Works as it should.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun electric toothbrushes for 20 years because they seem to be best rated consistently by CR, a national consumer magazine.  When I received the original of this model it was D.O.A. But Amazon facilitated a replacement, and though I have only used it a few times so far, it is obvious that this model provides a higher level of cleaning than the Braun I had been using the last few years.    It leaves my teeth with the slick just-went-to-the-dentist feel that a professional dental cleaning provides. I hope it isn&#x27;t scrubbing too hard--no reason to believe it is.    So I give this product a high pass. One thing that is disappointing, however, is that everything shipped appears cheapened, reflecing a made-in-Asia look. But then almost everything is made in Asia today rather than made by our own workers. Little wonder that there&#x27;s been a jobs crisis here at home with so much work exported.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never felt cleaner</li>
    <li> I like the different types of brushing: sensitive, daily cleaning, and whitening.  The rechargeable battery, at least right now, lasts a couple of weeks...   I definitely like the timer aspect of this.</li>
    <li> I received my toothbrush, used it two days and then it broke.  It&#x27;s been in  Personal Edge waiting for repair.  They&#x27;re having a hard time getting a part  for it.  Draw your own conclusions.</li>
    <li> This was my first electric toothbrush that i picked up after my visit to a dentist and getting my teeth cleaned. I wanted to improve my dental hygiene and decided on using electric brushes after reading some forums online. I got a good deal after Oral-B/amazon put a 50% rebate of the original price on their electric brush series. Prompt shipping from amazon, and after charging it completely, my first brush felt amazing with this electric toothbrush. Felt &#x27;dentist clean&#x27; :). I think the bristles are &#x27;medium&#x27; hard(the ones it comes with) and has a smaller brush handle for polishing/targeted cleaning(never really used it). Has a timer to tell you when you need to move from one region to another(shows regions on the monochrome display on the brush). Been using it for close to a year or more and never had any problems. Charges fairly quickly and maintains charge for a couple of weeks of daily brushing. Don&#x27;t let the brush run of battery too often as this may result in the brush losing its re-charging capabilities. I don&#x27;t think i will go back to regular brushes anymore.</li>
    <li> Works great, I wish I would have got the 5000, because I would like to have the timers as well.  Make sure you check your local stores to see if they have a special going on, just last week Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had a showcase of the 5000 series for $140.00 AND YOU GET A HALF OFF REBATE ON THAT MODEL!!!! so, I definitely didn&#x27;t get the best deal here... but as far as on-line, this was the best price.  Otherwise I love this brush, you will not want another toothbrush.  It&#x27;s great for traveling as well, you can put one toothbrush &amp; two brush heads in one case for you and your spouse.  Take the extra 5 seconds &amp; rinse it off after each use, so that it doesn&#x27;t get a build-up at the bottom of the base.</li>
    <li> I just received my SmartSeries 4000 toothbrush, and am disappointed that it does not include the items and features described on the amazon website or the Oral B website.  For example, it includes 2 brush heads (not 3 as stated), does not have a \\&quot;digital clock\\&quot; function as stated (no mention of this in user guide either), the charging station does not have \\&quot;brush head storage\\&quot;, and the base station does not have a protective cover! I plan to contact Oral B and amazon directly since this is totally unacceptable. Beware!     UPDATE - February 6, 2010 - spoke with customer service and sent emails to Oral-B and they agree that they sent me the \\&quot;old Triumph Series\\&quot; electric toothbrush in a new, factory sealed box that says SmartSeries 4000 on it - but they refuse to fix the problem! They claim they have the right to modify the contents of the package at any time.  DO NOT BUY THIS product if you are expecting to receive the SmartSeries 4000!  I&#x27;m going to write to Amazon.com and ask for a full refund (including shipping the product back).</li>
    <li> This toothbrush leaves your teeth and mouth feeling very clean.  Even after eating a meal, my teeth still feel clean.  The floss action brush works wonders!  The digital display lets you know when you&#x27;ve spent enough time cleaning your teeth by displaying a smiley face, a little juvenile but effective.  It has 4 different pulsating actions that will stop if you apply too much pressure to your teeth and gums.  Happy teeth + happy gums + happy mouth &#x3D; HAPPY YOU!    I highly recommend this toothbrush! BUY ONE NOW!!!</li>
    <li> I previously reviewed an older model 4000, so I have to edit that review rather than write a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging is slower than my previous 4000.  Be patient (maybe a day or more initially) and it will eventually give you a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush does an excellent job.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how it shuts off/on every 30 seconds...I think a simple beep is sufficient to let you know it has been 30 seconds.</li>
    <li> I bought this in Dec 2011 to replace a five-year-old predecessor of this model, which was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Alas, if only I buy that old model again...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4000 is the same system &amp; brushes, but I hated it on two counts:&lt;br /&gt;1. You can&#x27;t escape the \\&quot;programming\\&quot;. Oral B has decided for you that you can&#x27;t simply turn it on &amp; off. You MUST be captive to their programming, with interruptions every 30 seconds or whatever. This can NOT be turned off.&lt;br /&gt;2. The primitive LED display on the handle is FAR less informative than the LCD display on the old model. If you want the old display, you have to get their even more ridiculous 5000 model with the separate wireless unit. Insane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I returned it in accordance with their 60-day money-back guarantee. But that was a nightmare. It took about six months, after much aggrevation, to finally get my \\&quot;refund\\&quot;, but then it wasn&#x27;t a refund at all, but a debit card that I can&#x27;t put in the bank and has been a headache to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B&#x27;s attitude toward my problem getting the \\&quot;refund\\&quot; [sic] was poor. To their credit, they never disputed that I had returned the product (anyway I had proof of delivery), but they essentially wanted me to do their problem-solving for them. They would offer me the phone number of their bank so that I could investigate...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I wasted far more time and aggrevation getting the refund than it was worth. Had I known, I would have just taken the loss. And then, to find that after all that, it is not a REFUND at all, but a debit card...</li>
    <li> This is my first rechargeable electric toothbrush; had it for about a month, and it&#x27;s been working great.  I like the timer feature as a reminder to switch to the next quadrant, and battery last about a week with just one charge.  It leaves my mouth with clean fresh feel after every brush, and considerably better than what I used to use (manual brushing!).  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone interested in getting a set of electric brush.  I put 4-stars because I&#x27;m not sure what else is out there, but maybe closer to a 5.</li>
    <li> It works great for the surface but not between teeth. The brush is not thin enough...too bad.</li>
    <li> Great tooth brush, satisfied!</li>
    <li> This definitely changed the way I brush my teeth.  It gives a clean feeling like no other and I&#x27;ll never go back to the plain jane toothbrush again!  The travel box it comes in is definitely handy and is a nice addition.  So far the battery life is great, with about a week&#x27;s worth use before I have to recharge again (which takes approximately 24 hours).  Otherwise, it hasn&#x27;t broken yet, and I&#x27;ve been using this for a month or so.  The replacement brushes can be expensive, but if you wait for the sales at cost-co, they aren&#x27;t too bad.  The whitening brush is my favorite so far.  Also, the pack comes with a 7 dollars off coupon on your next replacement brushes.  I&#x27;ll update as I use this to see if the brush survives the test of time!  But so far, I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> It is much better then the Oral B that I purchased from Costco and the battery last longer per charge</li>
    <li> I received a different product than what I had ordered.  I had read that this had happened to other consumers as well and didn&#x27;t think it would happen to me.  Well, it did!  Be on guard on what you order and make sure you save your receipts.  If you have the time and patients to go through the return or exchange process, you&#x27;ll need it!</li>
    <li> Love the brush.  Only negative is that display cannot be seen while using.  It would be better if display was in the charging base.  Despite that, it&#x27;s an excellent brush.</li>
    <li> I have owned this product for approximately 5 weeks.  I absolutely love the toothbrush.  Based on a few of the other reviews, I would like to set the record straight.  When I opened the package, the toothbrush does say triumph professional care toothbrush.  Based on the research I did, Oral-B&#x27;s triumph is their pro brand.  In my opinion, it is a very nice toothbrush.  No differences I noted.  I did receive a travel case for the toothbrush and two heads.  It was made of plastic.  I also received two brush heads, whitening and flossing.  The battery lasts about the advertised time.  I noticed a difference in brushing when the battery was getting low vice when it was fully charged.  If you haven&#x27;t used an electric toothbrush before or it has been a while, it will take some time to get use to it.  It is a totally different experience.    I recommend your first time with the brush, push against the head to know what the \\&quot;brush feedback\\&quot; is when you are brushing too hard.    For the past 5 weeks, after every time I brushed, I feel as if I just walked out of the dentists office having a cleaning done.  I don&#x27;t know if my check-ups are better or not, but I suspect they will be.    One other thing I noticed, when I floss my gums do not bleed nearly as much as they did before.  I am going to guess that the brush is cleaning my gums and removing more plaque than with a regular toothbrush.    Bottom line:  I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone.  Especially with a 50% mail-in rebate offer when bought from select stores, such as amazon.</li>
    <li> We bought this for our teenage sons after the dentist recommended it. My husband and I use a Sonicare and this is a lot louder than the Sonicare and it doesn&#x27;t have the auto-shut-off after 2 mins. It has a smiley face that appears on a little screen so you have to keep track of the 30 second pulses or keep checking the screen to know when you&#x27;re done. Otherwise, it works great. There are different heads for different uses (more stuff to buy) but the boys have only used the floss action heads. The 50% rebate was a huge deciding factor. We were looking at another Sonicare but couldn&#x27;t pass up the offer,I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll have any regrets.</li>
    <li> My wife an I had Sonicares, and they lost their vibration power after only one and half years of use. We decided to try the Oral-B, and right away we noticed the difference. They just seem to scrub the teeth better, and the gums get a better work out too. Battery life is fantastic--easily get over one week on a full charge. Strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my Sonicare that died after some 7 years of service.  I like it better than the old sonicare with a few exceptions.  The good: it feels more powerful and like being able to see the brush actually move, as opposed to feeling some vibration that I&#x27;m not sure did much.  Here, I do know that it works and cleans.  And I can definitely feel the clean and the brush does get things that my manual brush and floss were leaving behind.  The bad:  Having to change the settings every time I brush.  This is annoying.  I use the whitening mode, and it has to be selected by pressing the triangular button on the handle every single time I brush.  Why couldn&#x27;t they make it so that it keeps your preferred settings?  This shouldn&#x27;t be that hard for a high-end brush.  They claim there is a pressure sensor that lets you know when you&#x27;re pressing too hard.  I tried it everywhich way and I don&#x27;t believe this is a real function of the brush.  The manual claims that the sensor stops the brush head from moving and the brush starts making a different sound.  The only thing I see is that if you press REALLY hard, you just jam the brush and it indeed stops moving and sounds a bit off.  Well, of course a jammed electric motor will sound differently and won&#x27;t spin the brush--DUH!--but this isn&#x27;t any kind of sensor.  Lastly, it is bulky, and the handle is only partially rubberized.  It can still slip from your hands.  The display is nice but is really more of a gimmick -- all it shows is three dots indicating the battery charge and which brushing mode you&#x27;re using.  I believe lower end models give you the exact same info with different color lights in the handle, and in a much lighter package.  At this point, really not sure if I want to keep the brush or return it.  Manual says that I can get my money back within 60 days if I don&#x27;t like the product, but don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d have to pay shipping.</li>
    <li> After my sonicare elite toothbrush&#x27;s battery died, I googled \\&quot;best electric toothbrush\\&quot; and came up with this one.   Money was no option and I wanted the best.   Oh boy was this a mistake.    It feels like a jackhammer molesting your mouth.  It&#x27;s loud and bulky.  In the description it says that it has a 2 minute timer, and 4 different modes, and a warning signal that sounds when you brush too hard.   While the sonicare toothbrush beeps every 30 seconds and shuts off after 2 minutes, this toothbrush simply stutters every 30 seconds, which is very hard to hear, and it never turns off.  It goes on until you manually turn it off.  It has a digital screen that tells you what mode you are in, and a smiling symbol that comes on after 2 minutes, but it&#x27;s impossible to view this screen as it&#x27;s only viewable when the toothbrush is on, and when the toothbrush is on you better have it in your mouth or it will spew toothpaste and water all over the place.  So in other words, there is a screen, but it is not possible to see what is on that screen.  The warning signal when you brush too hard is also a joke.  Supposedly there&#x27;s a subtle difference in sound vibration when you brush too hard, but I can&#x27;t hear a difference.     I miss sonicare.</li>
    <li> This is my third electronic toothbrush and the best of the three.  The product performs up to the manufacturers claims.  The price on Amazon is better then other comparable electronic toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Instructions need to be clearer.  Example, there are different colored  O rings with the brush: No instructions as to what they are for.I called: Meant to identify differnt persons using the brush.    Also, not clear on how to switch from one type of  brush power/preference setting to another.    Would be helpful if could set before toothbrush is inserted into  mouth.    Need better dental care instructions on how to make the \\&quot;Whitening\\&quot; setting work: Does one need special toothpaste? How long to expect results?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the electric toothbrush for a month now and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  Pros:  Cleans teeth very well  Recharging is fast  Keeps going on one charge for 1 month, using it twice daily.  Charging stand is small and doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the counter.  Comes with 2 different brush heads.    Cons:  Brush heads are small.  The toothbrush is pressure sensitive, and if you push too hard to your teeth, it pauses. It&#x27;s annoying.    This is the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> Price was right and it works better than my older version of the Oral B.  It still use that one as well, and expect this one to last for years.</li>
    <li> I use this one or two times a day.  I particularly like the audible signal that lets you know when to move to another section for brushing.  The charge could last a little longer, as well as take less time to recharge, but those nits don&#x27;t diminish the five star quality, or price.</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about purchasing this because of the price. I am so glad I bought it. It is easy to use, really gets my teeth clean. I like the warning it gives you every 30 seconds so you can move on to the next section while brushing. It makes you brush for the full 2 minutes, which I know I wasn&#x27;t doing before.</li>
    <li> Great product. 5 stars for this. You can buy it with out any worries. Than you. Great product. 5 stars for this. You can buy it with out any worries. Than you. I purchased from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is outstanding.  It actually makes me look forward to having to brush my teeth.  It cleans much better than my older style of oral B toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Received my toothbrush in very timely manner.  This is the best toothbrush that i have ever tried (and I have tried many \\&quot;spin brushes\\&quot; including some older Oral B models). I like the timing mechanisms that guides you through each quadrant of your mouth so you don&#x27;t lose track of your brushing routine. The spin brush is robust and yet gentle for your gums. I went to many stores looking for this model and comparison shopping. Found it at a $40 savings on line. Best deal and best product for me.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t complain.    I do not use all the settings, and the pressure sensor works, only when a lot of pressure is applied and I don&#x27;t believe any one would apply that kind of pressure on one&#x27;s own teeth :)). bought the product late in 2010</li>
    <li> After my last few semi-annual visits to the dentist for checkup and cleaning, I decided to purchase a spinning head brush.  My molars in the very back of my mouth never got clean enough, no matter what brush I switched to.  My wife has been using the Oral B 5000 model for a couple of years now, and I decided to make the jump into electronic tooth brushes myself.  I don&#x27;t see the point of an LCD screen on a toothbrush, nor a countdown timer, but I did want the option of multiple speeds; this is why I opted for the 4000 model.  Just like my Xterra I used to have, this brush has everything I need with nothing I don&#x27;t.  Have been using it for a week now and the difference is noticable.  My teeth feel much cleaner than ever before and I&#x27;m betting my next checkup will show that it&#x27;s doing a much better job cleaning my rear molars than traditional brushes have.  Also, I&#x27;ve only charged it once and it&#x27;s still got around 50% battery life, according to the meter.  I use it for about 3 minutes, 2x a day.  Very happy with this product so far.</li>
    <li> I just received the shipment from Amazon a few hours ago and discovered that the contents delivered are short a couple items in Amazon&#x27;s description in the \\&quot;In the Box\\&quot; section. The missing items are one of the three promised brush heads and a charging station with brush head storage. There is a charging station included but it has no provision for storing brush heads. I consider the brush head storage to be a critical omission; the missing brush head not so critical but still less than promised when ordered.    I have searched the Amazon site and cannot find any way to contact them about these omitted items. I could cancel the entire order but there should be some means for contacting them to report these omission and allow them to correct the situation without reversing the entire order. I think that Amazon should prominently place a \\&quot;Contact\\&quot; link through which problems of this sort can be reported either online or by phone.    I can&#x27;t legitimately rate the item because I haven&#x27;t used it yet but Amazon demands that a rating be given in order to provide a review.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! It arrived before the end date in good condition and my dentist is impressed! Happy Camper here!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for years and it has done a good job but when I needed a new toothbrush, I did some research and Oral-B was considered number one. We ordered this one and I have to say it is doing a better job of cleaning our teeth. The circular brushing really cleans and polishes the surface of the teeth and the vibration it creates stimulates the gums. We&#x27;ll see what the dentist says, but so far we like it.</li>
    <li> I use to have a Sonicare and since it broke I decide to change for Oral-B SmartSeries 4000, I got it a month ago and I am very please with, it has everything I need for my teeth, plus it is very easy to clean, something I can not say about the sonicare.  I do recomend this product.</li>
    <li> I just purchased 2 of the 4000 model b/c of the 50% off mail in rebate.  If I hadn&#x27;t cut the UPC codes for the rebates I would return them. I&#x27;ve used Oral-B 3D-Excel (older version of Pro. Care 4000) for a few years and liked that one much better than the 4000 model. I&#x27;m currently using Sonicare Flexcare. I&#x27;m all about electrical toothbrush would never go back to regular toothbrush if I have a choice. Here are the problems that I&#x27;ve with the Pro. Care 4000:  1. The unit is big an bulky in your hand as you brush. Big negative.   2. The Mode Selection on the brush does NOT work unless the brush is turned ON.  That&#x27;s the most retarded design for a electrical tooth brush that I&#x27;ve ever seen.  Anyone that has ever used an electrical brush knows that you want to select the mode (i.e. daily clean, quick clean, massage etc.) before you turn the brush on and start brushing. With this brush it&#x27;s likely that most people will just use the default Quick Clean mode.  If you&#x27;re going to select a different mode make sure you turn On the brush and select your mode before you put toothpaste on the brush unless you like cleaning toothpaste off your sink and mirror.   3. For this price of this brush it&#x27;s very disappointing that it does NOT come with a brush heads holder. If you have more than one person using this brush, they would have to leave their brush head standing by the sink or find a holder for it.     Overall I would NOT recommend the 4000 model or the 5000 model.  They both look the same except the 5000 model has one extra brush mode.  I think Braun really slip up on their design of these two models. I believe these are Oral-B flag ship models but there is no comparison with the Philip Flexcare. Maybe that&#x27;s why these things are 50% off.  Sorry to those who had to paid full price for these things.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this toothbrush based on the reviews.  I&#x27;d had a Sonicare for close to 5 years, but it finally died so I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try.  Compared to the Sonicare, this felt like a jackhammer: noisy, jarring, and altogether uncomfortable.  Maybe if this is the only electric toothbrush one has ever used, it might be okay, but compared to the Sonicare, it was just a miserable brushing experience.  After one use, I boxed it up to return.</li>
    <li> Fantastic toothbrush, after using my teeth feel as clean as going to the Dentist for a professional cleaning.</li>
    <li> I like this toothbrush a lot. I think it is even better than the Oral-B 5000. I like that it has 4 different modes to choose from, and that you can actually replace the battery if it goes bad, and it was much cheaper too.</li>
    <li> I will update once I&#x27;ve owned for a while, right now I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times total.  I did receive the 4000 (according to box, but toothbrush says &amp;#34;Triumph&amp;#34; on side and looks like pic of 4000), unlike some other reviewers, so it had the clip-on brush head holder.  I am not using the holder, so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s clip-on so that you don&#x27;t have to use it.  (The charging base is fairly small w/o the head holder, so it fits better where I have it plugged in.)  After using it 3 times on the original setting, my teeth actually hurt (though it didn&#x27;t tell me I was pushing down too hard--the indicator did not come on), so I have now switched to the sensitive setting and I think that&#x27;s solved the problem.  I had been using a 10+ year old Oral-B electric toothbrush, but apparently it is VERY gentle compared to this newer brush.  It still seems to be doing more than my old Oral-B--my teeth feel more smooth after brushing, I just have to turn it to sensitive as apparently my teeth and gums have to adjust to this more powerful brush.  [Update:  I have now used it a couple of more times and realized there&#x27;s a way to change modes without making a mess or having it on high power inside my mouth.  I wet and put toothpaste on the head b4 placing it on the brush, then turn on the brush clicking the mode button until the &amp;#34;feather&amp;#34; lights up, then turn the brush off and place the already prepared brush head back onto the powered part.  Now it&#x27;s ready to go and already on sensitive setting.  (The brush keeps the &amp;#34;mode&amp;#34; for 20-30 seconds while not turned on.)  I have also started using it on sensitive for 3 of the 30 second intervals, then switch it to polish for the last 30 second interval.  Instead of doing the &amp;#34;quadrants,&amp;#34; I brush the biting surfaces for 30 seconds, the back of my teeth for 30 seconds, and then the front for 30 seconds; so the last 30 seconds on polish I go over all the teeth for a sweep or two.  It seems to keep my teeth from being painful, yet does a more thorough job.]</li>
    <li> I have been using Oral B&#x27;s product for over 10 years.  I upgraded mine to Smartseries 5000 6 months ago and its great.  I&#x27;m getting the Smartseries 4000 for my daughter.  This product has improved my entire families&#x27; dental health.  It&#x27;s the best oral health product we ever had.  Now with the extra 50% rebate on the product - this can never go wrong and the best deal out in the market</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Interplak, Sonicare, &amp; Oral-B over the years and Oral-B&#x27;s Precision electric toothbrush is my favorirte design.  It works well, is easy to get around in the mouth, and will not make it feel like your teeth are vibrating uncomfortably or being drilled if your brush-head angle gets too steep (like Sonicare).</li>
    <li> The only reason I did not give a FIVE STAR rating, is that it does not have 2 speeds.  My older model has 2 speeds and I personally prefer that.  The toothbrush is great other than that.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both got these brushes just to \\&quot;try them.\\&quot;  We will never go back! They clean your mouth so much more efficiently.  I love the power of the toothbrush, as well as the cleaning/whitening options that it provides.  It holds it&#x27;s charge for almost two weeks, with regular twice a day use.  It is light and the travel case comes it comes with is great to keep brush heads and the base organized, at home as well as when traveling.</li>
    <li> I have had a Braun model for 6+ years which I always liked, however the battery wasn&#x27;t holding the charge so well anymore. So I ordered the Professional 4000 and it is a definite improvement.  The cleaning is better, the nose tickling is less, and the battery indicator is handy as well. Would definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife whose previous Oral B stopped working. Its been a month and she&#x27;s happy with it so far.  I got it at lowest price Amazon had so far and with 50% rebate I got from Oral B its a good deal.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush for my wife and because its easy to swap out brush heads, I have used it a couple times and now have bought my own. The power in the brush head speed is remarkable. It actually feels like you&#x27;re stripping away plaque and tartar every time you brush. Fantastic. I bought the 4000 model after considering the 5000, but I don&#x27;t need the extra remote timer gadget. Plus, the 50 percent off discount for either brush makes it a great deal.</li>
    <li> I wish I could return this, as I just was not pleased with the results it has given me.  Had a Phillips Sonicare brush before, and after reading reviews of this one, decided to get it as the Phillips are 4 times more expensive.  Simply put, the head is really big, and you can&#x27;t get into the nooks and cranny&#x27;s of your mouth as you can with the Phillips.  Flossing tips helped, but it simply doesn&#x27;t feel as clean when I am done brushing.  Am waiting for deal on a new Sonicare, as this thing is heading to the trash.</li>
    <li> I love it! My teeth look and feel so much cleaner! My girlfriend told me how great hers was and I thought she was exaggerating. Then I got mine! I bought the better model for my mom for Christmas. I wish I would have waited a little because hers cost the same and it comes with the clock/timer and holder.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B 4000 is great. I just went to the Dentist for a cleaning and I recevied very good comments. Great Product  Ken</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a 12-year-old one.  Technology has been improved and I just hope it&#x27;s longevity is as good.</li>
    <li> I am very pleasantly  happy with my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Takes up little space on the sink and works extremely well. Replacing one that lasted over five years. Recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my newbrush for a week or so. gets my teeth really clean.Love it!</li>
    <li> It vibrates so hard it made me nauseous.  It&#x27;s loud and clunky too.  I hope I can return this, as I never want to use it again.</li>
    <li> Best power brush I&#x27;ve ever used and I keep coming back to it even though this model is older</li>
    <li> I RETURNED THIS ITEM THREE TIMES!&lt;br /&gt;First time, I received the package 2 weeks after ordering. I tried charging it overnight and it did not work. I tried the next day and only lasted for 7 seconds, and the same for the next 3 days. I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;Second time, I received the item a week later, same story, it did not hold the charge. I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;Third time, you would expect the last time Amazon would make such mistake, right? I received this time the item only 2 days after. I was happier, but then again the brush did not hold charge. I returned it and now I am hoping to get my money back.&lt;br /&gt;I have owned an older version and understand fully how these charge, but it was always charging (max. I tried was 2 full days) and only lasted seconds to warn me with a red light it was once again out of power.</li>
    <li> I keep asking myself why have I been waiting so long to invest in a great toothbrush. Could have been the hundreds of dollars I&#x27;ve seen for other models and brands. I figured I would start in the middle price point and I don&#x27;t see any point in spending more then this. I am not disappointed. Does the job perfect in fact my dentist has commented on how much healthier and clean my teeth and gums are. I will never go back to manual toothbrush. The biggest plus is my son has his own color head, I know how long and how good hes brushing his teeth since the machine does it for him. This will save me money on trips to dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the pros&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable~~~Lasted me a week out of town on trip.&lt;br /&gt;Sounds~~~ Beeps every 30 secs&lt;br /&gt;Small stand with room for 4 extra brush replacements&lt;br /&gt;Multiple settings and warning red light so you don&#x27;t brush to hard&lt;br /&gt;Multiple brush head types are available to purchase if your not happy with the one provided.</li>
    <li> Once you brush with an electric toothbrush, you will never ever go back. I feel like I am visiting the dentist every day. My teeth are so clean! This version holds a charge for a long time, has the perfect amount of settings, etc. If you are shopping around or are a first time buyer, this would be the one to get.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for a long time. I was generally happy with it, but I often thought my gums were receding as a result of the sonic-speed brush hitting them. (Hard brushing can cause gums to recede.) I would often take a break from the Sonicare and use a traditional toothbrush because my teeth were becoming sensitive right at the spot where they meet my gums (as will happen when gums are receding.)    Anyhow, long story short: I finally purchased the Oral_b 4000 and I wish I had done it a year ago when I first started noticing my gum irritation. This toothbrush gets the teeth just as clean (possibly cleaner) and feels much better on my gums. I already see the difference in my gums--they look less irritated and I&#x27;m not having sensitivity anymore.    If you are trying to decide between Sonicar and Oral-b, go with Oral-b.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended an electric toothbrush and had high regard for Oral-B products, but I am sure he hasn&#x27;t tried this brush.  It is loud and the vibrations are intense.  If you have a sensitive mouth this is not the tooth brush for you.  I think if you could adjust the rate of its brushing that could be a great improvement.  Though there are several settings, I have found the differences are slight to unnoticeable.</li>
    <li> Good price and service.  Lives up to it&#x27;s advertizement.  Works great and really gets into all the spaces between the teeth,  I&#x27;m very pleased with it and the results.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has lived up to the hype.  It is easy to use and I especially like the 30 second/2 minute timer built into the brush.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought the Sonicare first&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Philips-Sonicare-FlexCare-Rechargeable-Toothbrush/dp/B0013TVEWA/ref&#x3D;sr_1_4?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;amp;qid&#x3D;1292108196&amp;amp;sr&#x3D;8-4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried it thought it was good, but I wanted to make sure it was better than the 4000 Oral B, after all these are close to 100 dollar brushes, after using both, I can say without a doubt the Oral B 4000 is a much better product, feels stronger, I like the round vs Oval head better and I like the digital display better as well, but the real difference is before and after feeling, the oral B was better for me.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Smart Series 4000 Toothbrush I purchased replaced a Phillips Sonicare Elite. That would have been much more expensive and offered no 50% rebate. I am completely satisfied with my new one and the cost difference makes it even better. It works just as efficiently as my previous Toothbrush.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have already covered, this brush comes with two brush heads (not three as described) and does not have features like a digital clock or brush head storage.  But, all of that aside, I LOVE this toothbrush and it really is a great bargain here on Amazon. I debated about spending the money on this toothbrush, but, man, am I glad that I did.  I&#x27;m notorious for brushing too hard, so it&#x27;s invaluable for me to have a toothbrush that regulates pressure! Also, the whitening brush head is like a dream and leaves a great polished feeling.</li>
    <li> I looked at Consumer Reports before I chose a replacement for my original rechargable toothbrush and this one was rated amongst the best. It definitely comes close the cleaning performed by my dentist and I am very pleased with it. It is easy to charge, holds the charge for a couple of weeks and comes with a compact travel case. The rounded shape of the brush allows one to reach behind the back molars; something not possible with a rectangularly shaped brush.</li>
    <li> Love it! I got 3 more for my mom dad and boyfriend. They all love it. I have been using it for 1 year and the quality is good. would like to recommend to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> At the recommendation from my dentist to purchase an electric toothbrush I did. And I am soo glad I have.  I can&#x27;t explain it very well but it has made a huge difference. Everytime I use it, my teeth feel cleaner. I love that it holds a charge for over a week! The only down side I would say is that it is a little louder than I anticipated but that&#x27;s Ok!</li>
    <li> I had a lesser Oral B and was amazed how much better the Healthy Clean worked. My teeth felt dentist clean everyday so far.</li>
    <li> The pause between each  timed cycle is a bit dramatic, but this toothbrush holds a great charge and is a great product.</li>
    <li> I had been a Sonicare user for about four years when my finally bit the dust.  I should have gone with my instinct to just purchase another Sonicare but I decided to do some research.  It really seemed like a Ford v. Chevy kind of comparison...people seemed very divided on their brand of choice.  I&#x27;m not sure what sold me but I decided to try this Oral-B out.  I knew from the first time I put this toothbrush in my mouth that I am clearly not a fan of Oral-B electronic brushes.  The brush head is way too big and cumbersome in my mouth.  I knew it would be an adjustment so I gave it a few days.  Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t enjoying my brushing experience at all.  Sonicare has a smooth and well sonic vibration to them.  This just felt like a cheap disposable electronic brush that I spent 10x too much for.  It&#x27;s louder which adds to the whole mechanical feel as it gyrates in your mouth.  Because I already used the product I couldn&#x27;t return to Amazon but I contacted Oral-B directly.  Luckily, they offer a 60-day challenge and guarantee a full refund for unsatisfied users.  I FedEx&#x27;d the toothbrush back and have to wait 8-10 weeks for my refund.  If you&#x27;re interested in doing the same you can call their Customer Service line (800-566-7252) for more information.  The shipping address that was provided to me was as follows:    Attn: 60 Day Challenge  Oral-B Braun Division  The Procter &amp; Gamble Company  Sobin Park and A Street, MS 1F  South Boston, MA 02127    Wished I could say I didn&#x27;t have to go through all the trouble of returning but hopefully this info. helps those of you looking to return your used product.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING ORAL-B RECHARGEABLE TOOTHBRUSHES FOR YEARS NOW.  I NEEDED A REPLACEMENT FOR MY LAST BRUSH AS IT FINALLY DIED AFTER 6 YEARS.  I PURCHASED THE PROFESSIONAL CARE THINKING IT WOULD WORK SIMILARLY TO THE OTHER ORAL-B BRUSHES I&#x27;VE USED OVER THE YEARS, BUT WAS TRULY DISAPPOINTED.  IT WAS QUITE INFERIOR SO I RETURNED IT TO THE STORE I PURCHASED IT FROM.  I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT ABOUT PURCHASING THE SMART SERIES 4000 BUT THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE THE LESS EXPENSIVE ONE A TRY FIRST.  I AM NOW USING THE SMART SERIES 4000 &amp; COULDN&#x27;T BE HAPPIER.  IT WORKS BEAUTIFULLY.</li>
    <li> I never used an electric toothbrush prior to purchasing this one. I was a little hesitant at first but decided to try the Oral B based on the reviews.   Very simple to use, might take a few days to get used to the new style of brushing. Your mouth definitely feels a lot cleaner. Good battery life and different cleaning options. If I had a complaint, it would be that the handle is a little bulky. But, overall it is a great toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is my second Oral-B toothbrush.  I previously had the Triumph model and loved it, but after about 3 years the battery started to lose capacity.  Unfortunately the batteries are not replaceable so I had to buy another.  This model seems to be basically the same as the earlier Triumph.    It does a great job of cleaning your teeth, which is about all I can ask for.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush to replace my 10 year-old Braun when it finally died. I was slightly irritated at first because I really just wanted something with no frills (like my old one), but had difficulty finding one. I decided to go with this because it seemed to be the best value for the price point and for what I wanted feature-wise (timer, battery indicator). I have to say, I don&#x27;t regret this purchase at all. This has been a fantastic toothbrush so far, and I can definitely tell that it&#x27;s an upgrade in terms of the pulsations/oscillations from my old one. The charge lasts me a full week, and I always feel like I have that &amp;#34;fresh from the dentist&amp;#34; mouth when I&#x27;m done. I think the pressure sensor light might be a little too sensitive, but it&#x27;s not a really a bother; I tend to ignore it. Basically, I highly recommend this brush!</li>
    <li> I purchased this 4000 series toothbrush because my wife has the Oral B-triumph 9000 series. The tooth brush looks the same but does not have the remote which i do not need or care to have.  The brush itself works great so far.  The life of the battery seems to be misleading.  The first charge lasted only 2 weeks brushing my teeth once each morning for the recommended 2 minutes.  I have since charged it 3 times and have had this only 6 weeks.  According to the manual, i should be able to brush my teeth twice a day and still only charge it every few weeks.  After two brushings, my battery shows one bar less on the indicator.    Amazon did a wonderful job and Oral B was prompt in giving my my reward card from the rebate.  i only wish the battery was longer lasting.  On a side note, the manual gives me 5 options i believe to brush my teeth (massage, whitening, cleaning, normal and i think one more option) but i only have 4 options on my tooth brush.</li>
    <li> My daughter really enjoyes brushing her teeth now with this higher end brush.  Would recommend it to all.  Really much better than her old non-electric brush</li>
    <li> This item was received as mentioned and works like I would have expected it to.  Takes less tooth paste and does a better job of teeth cleaning.  Have recommend to friends</li>
    <li> Really like these units, have used them for years.  Just wish they had a replaceable battery.</li>
    <li> Everyone in my family loves their Oral B toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I have never had a tooth brush this advanced before. I always thought what was the difference. I am not sure if it is the time that has passed since the 90&#x27;s but Oral-B has made an excellent product here! Has a timer so you can clear each area for a given amount of time, also it has different setting in case you have sensative teeth. On top of that a red light will come on if you push slightly too hard. This is great and the product speaks volumes. Never going back to non electric brushes. The head also comes off at ease, has a case, and are fairly cheap at the local grocery or Amazon of course.</li>
    <li> Have been using this toothbrush for a few days now. This is my entry back into electronic brushing after 10+ years of conventional brushes. Couldn&#x27;t afford a $100 plus toothbrush in college so I stuck with cheapies. Since using this I have not left the house with a cleaner feeling mouth in years. Really feels like it does a great job and has even encouraged me to enter into a daily flossing routine since I feel like I am taking so much better care of my teeth. I haven&#x27;t tried any other current models but I personally really like this one. Only flaw I can pick out it the annoying modes it has. I wish it would just stay on. I don&#x27;t need it to stop every 30 seconds or 1 minute to notify my and it is pretty annoying to wait for it to resume brushing. You know...privileged people problems type stuff. I realize that&#x27;s a really nit-picky thing to worry about but I wish there was a setting to just turn it on and go until i&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> We purchased this Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush about 12 months ago.  It gets used by both myself and my husband.  We each have our own set of brush heads, and prefer different types, but basically each kind of brush head is good.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad to read that others have had problems with this, because our experience has been great!  We have not had any problems that interfered with using it.  I returned to this site today because I&#x27;m about to buy one of these for each of our kids. The negative reviews give me pause, briefly - but I trust my own experience and I&#x27;m going ahead with the gifts.&lt;br /&gt;For now, I give this the highest rating.</li>
    <li> Nice brush except the noises</li>
    <li> I bought this in amazon few month ago, after 2 month of using, it not holding charge anymore???  What should I do? Return to sender???Anyone know how to fix it?  Thanks,  Huy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many electric toothbrushes over the years and this one is the worst, by far.  After a few days the LCD display on it died.  A month later this toothbrush turned itself on in the middle of the night and woke me up.  I got up to shut it off only to find out that there was no way to shut it off except to let it discharge on its own, which took about 15 minutes.  I couldn&#x27;t just remove the battery because the battery compartment has a lock on it which can only be unlocked with the charger which I didn&#x27;t have at the time because I was traveling.  So to sum up, after about a month of use, this $110 toothbrush ended up in the trash bin.  I have never had any problems with any other electric toothbrush, including other Oral-B models.  Save your money and stay away from this piece of junk. I wish I could give this product zero stars instead of one because it doesn&#x27;t even deserve a 1-star rating.</li>
    <li> I got my girlfriend this toothbrush as a gift and she loves it. We got another inter-changeable head for it so I can use it too, and it has worked out great. I love the the fact that it times how long you spend on each quadrant of your mouth, so that you spend the recommended time brushing your teeth.</li>
    <li> I own the old triumph (9400), which is exactly the same as this model as far as I can tell.  It does not have the wireless timer, but it does have a 30 second timer built into the brush and a smiley face that appears after 2 minutes (it&#x27;s not that hard to see in the mirror).      I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush for a couple of years and I have several issues.    First, the rechargeable battery is not a lithium ion battery.  This means that it suffers from a memory effect and really only lasts 10 days for just one person.  I minimize the memory effect by fully charging it when it is mostly discharged, rather than storing the handle in the charger every night.    Second, I recently discovered that the travel charger is prone to overheating.  I now have to unplug and replug my charger several times to get the toothbrush to charge.  My understanding is this design has not been changed.    Third, the toothbrush is only really good for the first couple of uses on a new charge.  After that it becomes noticeably less effective.    Fourth, it does not get my teeth as clean as the sonicare that I own.  I bought their cheapest model that runs (forever) on double A batteries.  That gets my teeth super clean.  However, the brush head is not small enough to do a good job on the back of my teeth, which is why I stick to the Oral-b brush.      On the plus side, the Oral-B brush does do a good job, when I can charge it!  I&#x27;ve used Oral-b rotary toothbrushes for 15 years and will probably continue to buy them.  My dentists agree I need fewer cleanings and my gums are in pretty good condition.  I just wish they&#x27;d get their batteries and chargers sorted out.    ----  UPDATE: My charger is now completely useless and a replacement costs fifty dollars.  I could buy a whole new set for not much more than that, but I&#x27;m holding off until a new product appears.  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Not sure if I got a bum machine, but the motor runs really loudly (much louder to the old brush this replaced).  Sounds similar to the drill at the destist, which is not something you generally want to be reminded of. :)  Works fine otherwise, so I kept it.</li>
    <li> We love this toothbrush, especially the travel charger. It didn&#x27;t come with a stand, but luckily we replaced an old one and can use that stand. The only negative is the button to change the brushing speed is on the handle where you can easily push it by mistake.</li>
    <li> We had an old unit put away for several years (different brand) and after deturmining it would not charge, we researched purchasing a new one.  Consumer reports was our first stop, to look for recommendations and then on to Amazon and other sites to see what others had to say. This was not a cheep unit but the 20 rebate did help.  My wife and I have both seen imporvements in our gums becasue we are brusing longer and letting the unit do the work.  She uses the Oral-B Sensitive head and I use the Oral-B DualAction Premium Power Toothbrush Head.  What we have learned is the less pressure you put on the unit when putting the brush the better cleaning you get.</li>
    <li> Have used it for quite a while know and would recommend it to all.  Best brush for the price. go for it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product that I bought my mom for Christmas. She has noticed a difference between her old electric toothbrush and this one. She loves it and uses the travel case when she travels. I think she will never go back to crappy electric toothbrushes again!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for an Oral-B brush I purchased some years ago.  I am very pleased with the improvements that have been incorporated into this new unit.</li>
    <li> When my wife found mold growing inside our Philips Sonicare I decided to switch to the Oral B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the Oral B because it is easier (for me at least) to hold, is very easy to clean and doesn&#x27;t have any place mold can grow.</li>
    <li> Good value. Holds a charge well.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. It cleans wonderfully and massages my gums to keep them healthy.</li>
    <li> This is my first professional toothbrush. I have had those cheap battery ones and those can&#x27;t even compare. I just leave my setting to the normal one and OMG totally have that dentist clean feel after. I had problems with plaque sometimes because I don&#x27;t visit my dentist very often. But daaang, this did the trick. Now it will probably take me longer to visit my dentist. Yup that good.</li>
    <li> Excellent price, easy to use, and has brighten my teeth.</li>
    <li> After running around in circles with a \\&quot;customer service\\&quot; representative on the telephone as I tried to explain to her that I have just discovered the features list in the product description is actually the features list for the SmartSeries 5000, I could not get her to stop arguing with me and change my order.  I additionally wanted the clock feature which I will not receive thanks to the bumbling \\&quot;customer service\\&quot; at Amazon.  The rest of the product (the actual toothbrush) is, I am sure, good as all others have described.</li>
    <li> from the first charge forward this is the best electric brush I&#x27;ve owned.  Effective, powerful, quiet.  The best!</li>
    <li> For the first time, I am actually enjoying using an electric toothbrush, after fighting them for years.  I got started due to near gingivitis condition and decided to finally bite the bullet on better brushing and flossing.  I used to use a cheap throw away electric toothbrush, but find the Oral B to be far superior.  I love the time feature, which reminds me when I have brushed each quadrant for 30 seconds and find it amazingly gentle, but firm.  A truly excellent purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a 10year old unit. Took a bit to get used to the bigger brush head, but I thinks it works better than the old standard head.    1/2 price after rebate... How could I pass it up. I don&#x27;t miss the old on-board storage box either which held the brush heads, it would always get moldy inside anyway.    My dentist is so mad I bought this... Now they can&#x27;t sell me  any \\&quot;extra\\&quot; services. I just go in every 6 months to get a cleaning and the hygenist always remarks how very little tarter I have AND how go my teeth look.    Get an electric brush... you will not regret it</li>
    <li> This is the second generation of the Braun 4000 for me and I am sold on it and the flossing head.  They eliminated the holder which was not all that useful since it gets wet and dirty and has to go in the dishwasher frequently.  They also eliminated the timer which also was not very useful since you had to stop brushing to see it and if you stopped the brush it would reset.  They also made the battery charge level display much smaller.  All minor changes in my book.      While the heads are expensive, the flossing head is worth its weight in gold.  My dentist even comments on how effective it seems to be when he cleans my teeth.  It also helps with gum massage.  If I travel and don&#x27;t use it for several days I can clearly tell the difference.  Any brush which supports the flossing head is worth it.  I now use my old one for traveling, so I can leave the new one for my wife.</li>
    <li> This seems much better than our cheaper Oral B we had been using for a year or so that kept needing batteries replaced.  My teeth really feel cleaner and I hope the dentist notices that the plaque buildup is less since I have used this professional series toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for one week,having previously been a long term user of Philips Sonicare, but am quickly adjusting to the obvious differences.  I think the Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 4000 Rechargeable Toothbrush will be as efficient a cleaner as was the sonicare.  The built-in warning when pressing too hard is also a plus.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 4 weeks now. Every time after brushing, I feel like I just came back from dentist office. One of the best purchases I ever made ! Worth every penny !!</li>
    <li> I have used the basic Oral-B electric brush for many years and have been happy with their product. The motor was getting old and it was time for a replacement.  I did research and found this to be a well received product by many people so I went ahead and bought it, actually bought two.  It works GREAT!  This professional edition product does a very thorough cleaning.  It is fun to play with the different settings and even as an adult it is rewarding to see the \\&quot;smiley\\&quot; face on the screen when I have brushed for the recommended time.   I get about 2-3 weeks between charging the brush motor.  I have not tried the floss or tooth whitening brushes but am happy with the standard head and they are readily available.  The one negative is that when you turn on the brush, if you want the whitening or longer brush time you have to hit a second button to get to that setting. It is not easy when the brush is in your mouth..don&#x27;t make the mistake and take it out of your mouth or paste will be flying everywhere....I always check the setting in the mirror while it&#x27;s in my mouth to be sure it is on my preferred setting. It is very easy to keep clean and no mold issues which I have heard as a complaint with sonic brand.  I do always detach and rinse the head and handle each time I use it though. If it was time to buy again....I would go for this one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using an Oral B since the introduction of the 3-D Excel model many years ago. I bought the SmartSeries 4000&#x27;s for my two adult daughters because I believe that this product will do a superior job in cleaning their teeth between dental checkups. I asked them how they liked their SmartSeries 40000&#x27;s and got \\&quot;fantastic\\&quot; and \\&quot;I love it\\&quot; for a replies.    I spent a lot of time and money keeping their teeth in great shape during their childhood and this product is a continuing investment in their great smiles and good dental health.</li>
    <li> Using the whitening toothpaste can make your cheeks shed a good deal of skin every morning (don&#x27;t worry, all sonic toothbrushes do this--you get used to it), but it certainly does the job!  I am a smoker and lots of people (including the dentist) have commented on how much whiter my teeth look.  I really like that the toothbrush tells you when you&#x27;re through brushing.  I would certainly recommend this toothbrush!</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush to replace a Philips Sonicare and I love the round head and makes my teeth feel cleaner.  The only complaint I do have is the battery life.</li>
    <li> great proformance, but a bit noisy</li>
    <li> Great price!! Great product!!</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush and cheaper than similar versions at walmart.</li>
    <li> Pros: Got it at $50 after rebate, easy to clean, cleans my teeth better than my old professional care brush, long battery life (20 days of brushing 2 times a day), comes with a travel case with holders for two brush heads, battery life indicator.    Cons: Not really a con, but I found the different brush modes to be useless.</li>
    <li> This is my first motorized toothbrush, and I&#x27;m so glad I chose a good one.  The Oral-B Rechargeable Toothbrush has provided me the cleanest mouth I&#x27;ve ever had (except for immediately after dental cleanings).  On short overnight trips, I still take my manual toothbrush, and - WOW - what a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this item does come with a sturdy plastic case for traveling.  It stays closed, has a place for two brush heads (I suppose if you had a spouse and wanted to share).  The toothbrush locks in place within the case, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it turning on and draining its battery in transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use some of the more advanced features, namely the timer, but I think it would be a plus for children.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m very pleased with my Oral-B!</li>
    <li> The Best Oral-B I&#x27;ve owned.  It&#x27;s more powerful than the cheaper models.  I like the Smiley face you get after 2 minutes of brushing.  I&#x27;ve been brushing longer than before and my teeth look great!  I have braces and after an adjustment when my teeth hurt I put it on the sensitive selection.  It does only come with 1 brush but with the rebate this toothbrush is worth every cent.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> For it&#x27;s final price after rebate, I definitely got more than my money&#x27;s worth.  Simple yet powerful with a slick design. Replacement brush head prices seem decent, too. Also, I received the rebate money under three weeks!</li>
    <li> After our Sonicare Elite died after 5 yrs, decided to try Oral B 4000 due to cheaper replacement head costs.      The Sonicare heads are expensive due to the use of rare earth magnets used to vibrate the heads.      The Oral B directions and setup were easy. Would have liked a stand for the unit and heads like the Sonicare has, but not a deal breaker.    After a week using the Floss Action head with my braces, teeth are noticeably whiter with less plaque build up.  The pressure sensor prevents you from brushing too hard with a change in sound and vibration.    Wife used the Pro White with polisher and also noticed whiter teeth.  For sensitive gums they have a soft bristle head which is not included in the kit.    Great buy at $67!!</li>
    <li> Only runs for 2 1/2 days.  May replace soon!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t love it, but it gets the job done, although it is sort of annoying.  I haven&#x27;t owned it long enough to gauge the long term ability of the battery.  The instructions do not mention the usefulness of depleting the battery completely on occasion, which typically aids the life of a battery of this type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Operates with a significant amount of power/speed so far, and this is adjustable to milder settings for gums etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s a little heavy. 2) Has a 30 second teeth brushing trainer timer which shuts the unit off for a couple seconds.  This is annoying and can&#x27;t be toggled off. 3) Can only adjust the speed setting when the unit is turned on, but you probably need to take it out of your mouth to do this, so it might spray toothpaste everywhere for a second or two.  4) The circular head it comes with is very peculiar in construction, and I trust more and prefer the typical standard circular heads (which can be used on this unit but are not included).</li>
    <li> This is a great brush.  I replaced an electric Oral B that I had for 10 years straight.  This one is much quieter and seems to do a better job cleaning.  I would definitely recommend this toothbrush to friends, family and people reading this review on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Very powerful. I like the improvements since my last one which was 10 years old.</li>
    <li> I really needed a new electric toothbrush and was looking forward to taking delivery of this one. I&#x27;ve been using Braun/Oral-B products for decades with great pleasure. This 4000, however, was a disappointment. The main component is very large and difficult to grip when wet. In general, I love &amp;#34;bells and whistles&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s the gadgetry on this brush that&#x27;s the problem. It constantly stalls when brushing (due to the press too hard feature) while meaningless lights are constantly flashing causing a distraction. It just became too annoying to keep. I returned the brush to Amazon whose return program is second to none. I eventually bought an Oral-B Model 2500. It must be a model designed specially for Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond because I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else. It&#x27;s the best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned and no bells and whistles; just an electric toothbrush. The 2500 was much less expensive than the 4000 but price really wasn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
    <li> Very good, fully satisfied. Not sure why brushes have to be so expensive so use Walmart brand</li>
    <li> My previous toothbrush was an oral B and it did a good job but this one has so much more power and cleans my teeth wayyyy better..</li>
    <li> Excellent, wife and I both love it.</li>
    <li> Wondering why I didn&#x27;t buy this earlier in my life. I have not so strong teeth &amp; this toothbrush has been great in keeping them healthier longer. I could feel the difference after the first week of using. Plus, my teeth are whiter :D</li>
    <li> Buyer Beware.  This is an old model SmartSeries 4000 toothbrush.  It does not match the pictures on amazon.  The model I received from Amazon does not have an LCD (as shown in the pictures) and has the older \\&quot;pin style\\&quot; charger vs. the new \\&quot;ring\\&quot; charger that Oral-B ships with it&#x27;s new models.  I&#x27;m sending back to Amazon and will source locally to ensure I get the correct model.</li>
    <li> I called Oral-B last night and they explained to me that their 4000 toothbrush was updated. They said the only differences were the removal of the LCD screen and addition of the extra toothbrush head case.&lt;br /&gt;I am waiting for a callback from Oral-B on what makes this new version better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the newer version. In the two days I&#x27;ve had it, it has cleaned my teeth really well. I would have liked to get the older version with the LCD, but hopefully Oral-B will get back to me with an explanation on why it was removed and what makes this new version better.</li>
    <li> I really like this model.  It works well and I can already see and feel a difference in my teeth and gums.  The new base is much easier to clean.</li>
    <li> Great price,  a very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Travel case is nice, the toothbrush is solid. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of years and never had a hiccup.</li>
    <li> This is my second Oral-B toothbrush (only bought it because I left mine at a hotel). My first one lasted over 6 years and still worked like new. Definitely would recommend this toothbrush over Sonicare. FYI: These toothbrushes are made in Germany; Sonicares made in China</li>
    <li> it is a good e-toothbrush, however, cant stop the toothpaste spilling out of my mouth with water at the first time....</li>
    <li> I have been using electric toothbrushes for many years now.  The last model (also Oral-B brand) had issue with the switch (once off the cradle, it cannot be turned off, until it runs out of charge), forced me to consider buying a new one. I loved this model  because it also offers a travel case.  The base is not too large, so the brush does not take a lot of space on the counter.  The only disadvantage is that this brush has only a single base.  If there are two people who want to use the brush, each person will have to replace the head prior to use, so the other person can use it.  The price for this toothbrush was the best deal I could find (I checked retail and online stores).  Now I am in search of spare Oral - B toothbrush heads at affordable prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as cleaning job - this is definitely superior kind of toothbrush.  It is better than battery operated toothbrushes one can find in grocery stores.  The manual toothbrush simply cannot compare to the power of cleaning that electric toothbrush can do.  After using this product, I cannot imagine going back to using the manual toothbrush.  I recommend this product if you are serious about your oral care.  Product is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have to say, I did read the many reviews of people who received their toothbrush &amp; it was not the SmartSeries 4000 as pictured in the 2nd picture of the ad.  So, I knew what I was getting into when I ordered.  When my shipment arrived, the picture on the front of the box does match what I received, with the correct name.  So I don&#x27;t know if there was an original at some time in the past &amp; then they changed the SmartSeries 4000 to have the little digital window at the bottom of the handle or what.  Then when the upgraded version went out, they had a hard time getting rid of the older one &amp; started selling them at a cheaper price point?  I don&#x27;t know, but that&#x27;s my theory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I decided to go ahead &amp; keep it.  My favorite thing about it is the deep cleaning option &amp; the battery light indicator on the handle.  My least favorite thing is it is SUPER loud.  Probably the loudest out of all the electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever had.  When this one doesn&#x27;t work anymore, I&#x27;ll definitely go to the store to get the latest, so I know for sure what I&#x27;m getting.</li>
    <li> Love the way my teeth feel with this toothbrush. Recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I was using a FlexCare+ Rechargeable sonic toothbrush and it died after about 2 years. I did a bunch of reading and talked to my dentist. After assessing all the info I gathered and the price of the main unit and brush heads, I decided on this unit. It is a great shape/size and easy to keep clean. The features I like the most are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quadrant Timer- It pauses letting you know that section of teeth are clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too Much Force Indicator- A red light illuminates when you brush too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hard case is also a great bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I need another brush I am very content!</li>
    <li> I have had this for almost a year.  It&#x27;s a good toothbrush, but sometimes feels a little too powerful. I like that it lights up to warn me when I am brushing too hard. I thought I would like that it beeps every 30 seconds between &amp;#34;quadrants&amp;#34; -- however, it turns out I really don&#x27;t care for this feature or counting the beeps (&amp;#34;Wait... was that 3 beeps or 4?&amp;#34;).  Instead, I wish the brush would just shut off after the entire 2 minutes of brushing like my previous Oral-B power toothbrush (which was from 12 years ago) used to do.  Admittedly,when I selected this toothbrush,  I fell for all the bells-and-whistles it has.  However, I never use them... If I had it to do over, I probably would have just bought the more basic model.</li>
    <li> Been using an electrical toothbrush for years until it died.  Hated using regular toothbrush - I would brush for 10 minutes and still not get my teeth to feel as clean as with electrical toothbrush.  When we bought this Oral B - wow - it was 5 times better than our old version!  Love this toothbrush - with several different settings and carrying case for travel - will never brush my teeth with manual again - uck!!&lt;br /&gt;And this price is best anywhere - cheaper than Walmart&#x27;s older model - best online and in the store.  Amazon - thanks for beating the competitors - give me what I want at exceptionally great price!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush works like it should. It gives you 30 seconds per section of your mouth so you brush your whole mouth evenly for two minuets total. The reason I chose this brush over Philips Sonicare is because the brush heads are a little cheaper and its made in Germany, not China! Overall a great deal on this great brush.</li>
    <li> I believe we should be able to keep our natural teeth for our lifetime.  And I think this will help.  It does a better job of scrubbing the teeth than a regular brush.  Also saves time since it works so fast that I&#x27;m done sooner.  I also use a Waterpik and floss.  Haven&#x27;t had a cavity in years.  I only wish that I had taken better care of my teeth when I was younger.  Get one for yourself and get them for your kids.  They will have fun using it and it will keep their teeth clean.  It will more than pay for itself at the dentist office.</li>
    <li> dentist recommended it, but feels really aggressive and rough compared to phillips sonicaire, worry that it&#x27;s damaging gums--cut my gum in one place that took almost a week to heal--wish I could return it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving it. The only issue I have with it is the battery charger only works for 110v. So if you want to bring it with you for international travel, it may not work at European countries which uses 220v. The battery only last for 6 days which is a lot shorter than the manual says 10 days.</li>
    <li> Still testing out brush and various settings to find which one is best for me.</li>
    <li> I prefer to use electric tooth brushes because I have a tenancy to press too hard with a manual tooth brush and irritate my gums.  I got this when my Sonicare died; in my opinion the Oral-B cleans better.  The disadvantage of Oral-B compared to Sonicare is that it is difficult to brush with your mouth closed.  Brushing with your mouth open allows toothpaste to run out and get onto the toothbrush handle.  Given the choice, I prefer this one over Sonicare.</li>
    <li> We use this toothbrush everyday, the two of us.  We wanted one unit with multiple brush storage.  A few plusses:  multiple speeds, 45 second timer, travel case.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for many years. Batteries last for a couple of years, so it&#x27;s worth the price. What&#x27;s most important, my teeth and gums health are excellent and I only have to visit my dentist once a year.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Oral-B since 2010. It still works flawlessly. That is why I decided to purchase the Oral-B 4000 SmartSeries. I trust the brand has its quality settings higher than others. So far I have not been let down by any of my Braun purchases. Just like this one. Feels solid in the hand, battery also seems to last quite a while (one charge so far lasts for 20-24 &amp;#34;brushings&amp;#34; of 2 minutes each) and the brush seems to be doing its job pretty well... Was irritating at the beginning, but you just have to get used to how to use it. Gums don&#x27;t bleed and the flossing action really does seem to do its advertised function. Very satisfied so. As expected.</li>
    <li> 32 days after purchase and battery has stopped charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything was working as expected.  But on the 32nd day, I placed my toothbrush back on the charging dock and it didn&#x27;t blink (to indicate charging).  I tried a different power outlet and still no charging blink.  I&#x27;m down to one bar now and need to contact Oral-B customer service to send my toothbrush in as my purchase has passed Amazon&#x27;s 30 day refund period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Googling also uncovered a history of Oral-B charging issues for the higher price electric toothbrushes (model 4000 and up...possibly even lower lines).  This is unfortunate that it occurred and I hope Oral-B will cover any fees to have my toothbrush sent to/from their service center.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with any oral-b electric toothbrushes.  Just had to replace my old one that lasted me about 10 years....the battery finally died.  Great product especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an impulse buy when it was deeply discounted on sale.  I should have listened to my dentist earlier - my teeth obviously look and feel much cleaner now after just 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushing side of things is great - I stopped using an electric toothbrush when I moved to the U.S. a few years ago, and had forgotten how great they are.  I like the built in timer and &amp;#34;brushing too hard&amp;#34; indicator, which have reminded me how long to brush for and how hard to press on my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why not 5 stars?&lt;br /&gt; 1. it takes a long time to charge from fully discharged (much longer than overnight; manual claims &amp;#34;40 minutes charge for 2 minutes brushing&amp;#34;) - I find this intolerably slow as I don&#x27;t like to leave things plugged in 24x7.&lt;br /&gt; 2. it is 110V only, so not exactly great for long trips overseas, but survived a 10 day trip.&lt;br /&gt; 3. the built-in timer has some &amp;#34;beeps&amp;#34; that can&#x27;t be disabled.</li>
    <li> I have bought four of these,one for the family, then one for each child when they went off to college,  I bought this one, the fourth one, because my wife and I take separate trips and neither wants to be without it.  We have used the other brand where the brush moves up and down.  We all think that the circular motion of the Oral-B brushes is superior; you have more control.  There are a variety of brushes available but we use the precision clean, the floss action, and the sensitive gums regularly.  Brushes last about 6 months or longer.  Dental health is so important!  The bacteria in mouths has been linked to arterial plaques which cause blockages (heart attacks) and to inflammation, a serious issue.  Brushing your teeth for two minutes, the required minimum, is easy with this brush.  Follow brushing with flossing and a mouth wash.  It takes just 5 minutes!  This is one of the least expensive health products you can buy.  It really works; no hype needed.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old Oral B 1000 after that stopped holding a charge (after many years of use). This one is so great that my husband has been using it instead of his 3000. Great price here on Amazon. I don&#x27;t use any of the other optional modes, but as an everyday toothbrush this is great. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t get a more expensive one with more bells and whistles - all I wanted was a toothbrush that was going to clean well and this one is perfect. My husband and kids call it the &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Very nice precise cleaning toothbrush. Has three adjustable levels, and a red light that comes on if the toothbrush head is going to get stuck.</li>
    <li> I have a older model of the Triump 5000 and battery is failing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is much better in the sense that it spins signicantly faster.  Also the pressure sensor sets off a red indicator light if too much pressure is applied.  Charging time pretty much the same, couple of hours.</li>
    <li> My teeth effect is very good</li>
    <li> Going mechanical had never even crossed my mind in the past but now my teeth are cleaner then they have ever been and are visibly whiter, this is one of the best purchases I have ever made.</li>
    <li> This brush is outstanding and does a much better job of cleaning teeth than AA powered cheap brushes. My teeth felt much cleaner after the first use compared to my old brush. The timer is a great function also. There is no way I would go without this brush again. It is well worth the money and in the end probably saves quite a bit in dental bills.</li>
    <li> Overall I feel my teeth is a lot cleaner than manual brushing. I&#x27;m able to get to hard to reach places in the rear of my mouth. I did notice a lot of plaque(?) coming off my top front teeth that I haven&#x27;t noticed before while flossing. I don&#x27;t know if this is a result of the toothbrush loosening the plaque or just missing it altogether. One major gripe is it takes forever to fully charge. I have to leave it on its cradle for pretty much an entire day in order for it to fully charge from empty. But with lots of intuitive features, such as a timer, pressure sensor, different modes, it kinda makes up for its deficiencies.</li>
    <li> Sure wish I had purchased this along time ago! I love this toothbrush. I bought regular brushes for it since it came with a polish brush. It worked fine but I thought I would save it to use for that purpose only &amp; not use it every day.</li>
    <li> The manufacturer has been lowering the amount of brush heads from 3 to 2 to now only one. While the description on the box is accurate, you cannot see that until after you have bought the product. Buying this with a coupon has made it easier to swallow, but knowing in advance what you are getting seems to be a not unrealistic expectation. I expected better from Oral-B and Amazon.</li>
    <li> my wife uses it and likes it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed by this toothbrush.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.  The timer mechanism makes it easy to be sure that I have brushed all of my teeth and not just some.  Overall. the unit is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Well designed electric toothbrush. I can clearly sense the difference after using for two weeks, twice per day. Teeth feel cleaner for longer period of time after brushing. Gum line is also cleaner. Spouse is also using it and thinks the teeth are showing an improved whiteness.</li>
    <li> I love my toothbrush.  It works very well, especially the pause to change areas of my mouth.  The only down-side I have found is that the handle is rather large, and I have largish hands.  Other than that it&#x27;s just great.</li>
    <li> This works as long as you don&#x27;t mind traveling with the charger.  Battery does not hold a charge for more than two days, despite the 2 week claim.  Just after the warranty ended, it started to decrease in strength of daily brushing as well.  Very disappointing for the price, and because I&#x27;ve have other oral B last far longer.</li>
    <li> Good electronic toothbrush. It was easy to set up and charge - my only concern was the charging light didn&#x27;t come on right away but the directions specified that it might take up to 10 minutes to show up and it did come on within ten minutes. The first charge takes awhile but the toothbrush holds that charge for a long time. It has a light that will flash if you&#x27;re brushing too hard that&#x27;s on the back of the toothbrush so you can see it in the bathroom mirror. The carrying case is really nice. It holds the brush and two heads.</li>
    <li> Oral-B healthy clean!!</li>
    <li> Good product, exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> I had Sonic Flexcare for years and it just died.  Read reviews and found Oral B rated best.  Didn&#x27;t need the 5000 model.  Would never use the extras.  So I bought the 4000.  Before I bought it, I looked and looked to see if it came with at least one extra brush head.  Too many reviews said nothing about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I get this $95.00 model with only one brush head.  It is quite sheeny if you ask me.  At very least they should make sure EVERY buyer can easily see they need to order extra brush heads at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not happy about it.</li>
    <li> This worked great for 7 months, and then stopped charging.  I&#x27;m super bummed because my previous model lasted me years!</li>
    <li> This is what I was expecting with some additions that I was hoping for but didn&#x27;t want to pay more for the more expensive ones.  It has a timer for how long you should brush a portion of your mouth, has a whitening mode are the extra things that I liked but wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
    <li> This is the worst of the Oral-B toothbrushes that I have purchased. In fact, this is my second one, because I returned the first due to poor battery life -- it was dead in 4 days. So I sent it back and got another of the same one, hoping it was just THAT toothbrush. It is NOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this one, I have a single flashing light by the fifth day. So I plug it in and it takes at least two days (or more) to recharge again. It seems (although not really true), that I spend as much time plugged in as not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my third (or 4th, including the replacement one) Oral-B electric toothbrush. I do not think I will purchase another.</li>
    <li> This is my third electric toothbrush i have owned. The first one i had was the  [[ASIN:B001CX4JSS Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]] and then i had the [[ASIN:B008PEMNJY Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Sensitive Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]. This product is by far the best electric toothbrush i have ever owned. It is ergonomic and presents useful features as the charge level display. Another excellent feature is the travel case which can hold two brush heads and the handle. Thanks to this toothbrush i have no problems when visiting my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other side, the toothbrush voltage is 110V. Therefore, i need to use a power adapter in order to charge the toothbrush because i live in Peru and the voltage here is 220V. Also, i bought a [[ASIN:B0002KHU3I Oral-B Professional Dual Clean Replacement Brush Head 3 Count]] and unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothbrush for about an month and love it.  I have noticed that my teeth are actually whiter.  I alternate between using the floss action head and the polishing head it came with.  I was kind of skeptical, but the price was good so I gave it a try.  My teeth really do feel like the dentist cleaned them with every brushing.&lt;br /&gt;I think the brush I got may have a different name, but I think that&#x27;s just an Oral B switch.  It still does all the functions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the reviews were so great but when I received this, even after charging it for an entire day, it would not turn on. Incredibly disappointed since Oral B is supposed to be reliable and will not be suggesting this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I just received this yesterday, so ive only used it twice so far. Ive never used an electric toothbrush before, so its taking a little getting used to. So far so good with this product. I feel like my manual toothbrush leaves my teeth feeling like they still need to be cleaned, and this toothbrush left me feeling a lot more clean. I will definitely use the sensitive mode the most, as the regular daily clean mode is a little rough for me. The toothbrush seems like a good quality. I like that the battery says it will last charged for ten days, which will be nice when I got on vacation. I also like that it had a travel case for the same reason.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for the earlier model of the same series that I had used for just over two years. The older one&#x27;s battery did not hold a charge any longer. I wanted the same model again because using this toothbrush with the floss-action heads gives me great dental check-ups!</li>
    <li> Use it every day.  Even take it on vacations with me. Got this at the request of my dentist. Last check up was great.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife cause old one was dieing. She loves it. especially the features. Not your ordinary toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Needed to change to the softer bristle toothbrush due to sensitivity.  Works great</li>
    <li> Great price and works good. The base is small, so it fits nicely on our bathroom sink.</li>
    <li> Fully Satisfied. Works great .</li>
    <li> great product and price</li>
    <li> Really does the job.  The 30 second timer for each quadrant of your mouth is a cool feature.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 toothbrush for myself and my wife. It works excellent WHEN IT WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;However, after 6 months the base was not charging. I contacted customer service (mellisaa from P&amp;G), they said they will repair but I need to pay the shipping cost for sending and receiving the items. Since I need to send all the parts (which is heavy), it will cost more than the new tooth brush. So, the warranty is a full of crap. It&#x27;s their fault to have faulty machine, so they should take care of it.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE BE AWARE OF P&amp;G CUSTOMER SERVICE... I WON&#x27;T RECOMMEND DUE TO HASSLES.</li>
    <li> I have had this one for awhile now it works great. My wife was skeptical about using one but after she bought one on sale she is now hooked on using this. Does a much better job than a manual brush. Not one cavity after using different Oral-B for years.</li>
    <li> I love it. I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year and with replacement heads, it still works great.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product has a plug end that is not compatible with standard adaptors and had no indication of this prior to purchase! I would not recommend purchasing electrics via amazon in the future!</li>
    <li> My teeth feel super clean after using this brush. Stays charged a really long time. The 30 second timers are really cool as well.</li>
    <li> This is the third Oral-B electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve owned over the past 20 (or so) years. I replaced the last one because it seemed to brush with less and less strength and speed. This one is clearly the best of the three. Strong brushing action has completely different feel from the prior brushes. I thought I would be annoyed by the pauses in the brushing cycle, but find them helpful reminders to move on. Overall, I feel this is a significant improvement over the past brushes.</li>
    <li> My old Braun toothbrush was not holding a charge. I began looking at different places for the new toothbrushes. Was pleased I could find it on Amazon for a decent price. I have enjoyed the different features of this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Product came as advertised and works well.  It really helps gum problems--much better than the old fashioned toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Tooth brush functions as advertised. Easy to use, charge lasts more than 1 week.  Still need next dental check to know it is better than manual brushing</li>
    <li> This power brush has a great cleaning action. The battery is very strong. Still going after a week off the charger. Strongly recommend.</li>
    <li> Knocked fillings out. Does not substitute for traditional flossing. Leaves food behind. Finally, compared with the traditional elegance of traditional Braun products, it is UGLY. Of course I am an art director and designer so such things matter more than getting a smiley face when you have brushed the right amount of time. They must have given this assignment to the product designers at Gillette rather than Germany.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about getting a rechargeable toothbrush -especially at this price.  I wanted to be sure I was getting what I paid for. But I love this product - wonderful clean feeling, charge lasts several days, and the timer is great - I know I&#x27;m not over brushing and damaging my teeth. Absolutely love it !</li>
    <li> this is a really great toothbrush. i ordered it for my boyfriend, actually, and he loves it! his teeth look great!</li>
    <li> This electric toothbrush leaves you with a dentist clean feeling every time! I&#x27;ll never go back to a manual brush!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if mine was a lemon, but after a few months it would hold a charge anymore, then it got to the point where it wouldn&#x27;t even start, no lights no movement, nothing. Braun wanted me to send it for repair out of my pocket. I just threw it away.</li>
    <li> Love the product. First time user and i notice the different after using oral-b. If your brushing to hard it will let you know. I recommend.</li>
    <li> This electronic toothbrush works great. I have periodontal disease and was previously using a Sonicare, which was okay. I feel that this toothbrush is superior at removing plaque and debris because of the rotating motion. The motion is very similar to the polishing tool they use at the end of a dental cleaning. Also, the battery life on this toothbrush is awesome. I&#x27;ve left it off the charger for several days without any issues. Don&#x27;t forget to buy replaceable brush heads for the unit, I&#x27;d recommend the sensitive ones if you&#x27;ve got gum issues. Anyways, I highly recommend this product to anyone struggling with dental issues, I feel your pain! Stay flossy.</li>
    <li> US 110 voltage but on 220V voltage areas in need with a voltage converter</li>
    <li> A great toothbrush, but I have noticed after having two of them that the battery life slowly becomes less and less starting around the 1 year mark. This means eventually I have to charge it almost every day versus once or twice per week. If it was not for that and the steep price tag I would give it five stars.</li>
    <li> As a Sonicare user for years I prefer this.  I think my mouth feels cleaner.</li>
    <li> Works great, does exactly what it is suppose to, really like the way the toothbrush will temporarily stop when you are causing too much pressure on your teeth.</li>
    <li> It is fantastic to brush my teeth with this model. Cleans and polish very well, easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love it. My mouth feels great.  Kid love it too. I bought two</li>
    <li> Does everything I wanted (whitens, cleans, and better outcome from dental visits) and so I&#x27;m not paying for excessive frills of the most recent, more expensive model.</li>
    <li> Would recommed this product, works great, my teeth feel super clean.  Test it out you would be glad you did</li>
    <li> This is an totally awesome product, and I just love it!!!!!  It is fast and gets my teeth super clean!!!!!</li>
    <li> Have had an electric toothbrush for a number of years, and waited much too long to replace it. This toothbrush is much more powerful and does a much better job of cleaning my teeth than the old one. Certainly glad I made the change.</li>
    <li> Amazing tooth brush but head does gum up with nasty brown stuff? Needs a thorough boiling water clean every week to keep the crusty build up at bay.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun shaver since 1997. It still works flawlessly. That is why I decided to purchase the Oral-B 4000 SmartSeries. I trust the brand has its quality settings higher than others. So far I have not been let down by any of my Braun purchases. Just like this one. Feels solid in the hand, battery also seems to last quite a while (one charge so far lasts for 20-24 \\&quot;brushings\\&quot; of 2 minutes each) and the brush seems to be doing its job pretty well... Was irritating at the beginning, but you just have to get used to how to use it. Gums don&#x27;t bleed and the flossing action really does seem to do its advertised function. Very satisfied so. As expected.</li>
    <li> Not that brushing your teeth is fun, however, this tooth brush makes it a lot easier.  The 30 second timer for each quadrant is cool and I often spend more time brushing after the two minutes are up.  An electric toothbrush was recommended by my hygienist as I tend to be too rough on my gums and this toothbrush has a warning light when you are pressing too hard.  On the down side, it was a lot more expensive than I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> brushes work great...when they keep a charge; had to have one fixed right out of the box for a faulty battery. they keep the teeth very clean and refreshed but after a year or so forget taking it on a trip longer than 3-5 days - otherwise its as good as a regular brush.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for about a month now.  I had to get use to the brush head being in my mouth.  I like the fact that it has a timer built in to it.  It makes it a whole lot easier to get the recommended time needed for brushing.  I like the overall feel and the base is quite nice.  I wish it had a holster for the toothbrushes though.</li>
    <li> This is my third Oral B electric toothbrush and the Oral B 4000 has a few improvements over its predecessor models.  The compact, low-profile charging base makes it travel friendly, as does the hard plastic carrying case for the brush handle which means the battery will be fresh when you arrive vs. dead because the button was pressed against other luggage.  The handle is more bulky and heavy than before but it fits my hand better.  The digital display is helpful for battery status.  There are four different speed settings which are difficult to access because the selection button is a considerable distance below the on button.  Prior models used just one button.  You can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;re doing because the brush needs to be in your mouth before you turn it on.  Battery is replaceable now which is great.  Overall, a great design.  Hope it lasts 17 years like my first model.</li>
    <li> This product fully met my expectations and I was completely satisfied.</li>
    <li> We upgraded to this model from the basic oral b electric toothbrush because of the additional modes for cleaning, the battery life indicator and the battery life. There are three of us who use this toothbrush base and it lasts us about seven days between charges. The additional modes that it provides are nice since occasionally we need to switch it to sensitive mode for the kids. THis toothbrush does a very good job and leaves your mouth feeling very clean when finished. My wife and I are very competitive as to who does a better job brushing the kids teeth and we started using the mouthwash that shows any particles that it gets out after brushing. She uses a plain oral b tooth brush and I use this one and I have not lost yet. There are usually very few to no particles left behind after brushing.</li>
    <li> Excellent tooth brush.  We have owned Braun toothbrushes over the years and have never had a complaint about any of them.</li>
    <li> Has worked out great. Our old one has a cylinder type of holder for the brushes which needed constant cleaning. This has a flat holder for the brushes much better.</li>
    <li> Love it and my dentist even said she could tell a difference.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!~!!</li>
    <li> I was used to brush my toot and gum with way more energy. The product could be less sensitive... the toothbrush stop 1-2 sec to prevent too munch pressure :-o.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After less than 1 month of using it, the dentist say the job is really great.</li>
    <li> I like the smaller brush head.  It&#x27;s able to reach back to the wisdom teeth I miraculously still have at 64.  I don&#x27;t like the blinking red light (brushing too hard) or how easy it is to push the wrong button when trying to turn the thing off.  I realize I might not have the reflexes necessary to handle this brush, maybe I should have bought the simplest one,  but it does a good job.  I&#x27;m a coffee drinker and it really helps.</li>
    <li> This is a great improvement over the earlier Professional model that I had. The handle fits perfectly and the lights that reflect the pressure applied are very useful. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly enjoying this toothbrush, although it took a couple of days to get used to how strong it moves compared to my old toothbrush, or even manually brushing my teeth.  My teeth feel cleaner, and my dentist is happy - which is always a good thing.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give all stars was because it does not include a wall-adapter - and space on top of my bathroom sink is not available.  I ended up using my old wall-adapter and just placing this one on top of it. It looks stupid, but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I bought the Philips Sonicare rechargeable toothbrush a couple of years ago.  After it died, I contemplated buying another but in the three years I used it, the hygienist at the dentist&#x27;s office never seemed to notice any substantial improvement.      So after reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided to try the Oral-B toothbrush.  It was cheaper than the Sonicare and after using it for four months, I went for my semi-annual cleaning.  There was a new hygienist whose only remark was that there was very little for her to do as everything was so clean.    Here are a few things that I have learned from using both the Philips and Oral-B rechargeable toothbrushes: (1) Don&#x27;t leave these electric toothrushes in the charger; I gave the Sonicare&#x27;s second toothbrush and travel charger to my son and he only charges it at intervals so both are still working five years later!  The Oral-B has an indicator which lets you know that it needs to be charged. (2) Accustomed to the Sonicare shutting itself off after three minutes, I neglected to note that wasn&#x27;t true for the Oral-B; so the first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the little buzz at 30 second intervals nor the buzz-buzz-buzz at the two minute mark (nor could I see the smiley-face in the display on the handle).  When I finally figured it out, I did have very clean teeth but try not to zone-out while you&#x27;re using the Oral-B!  (3) After reading some comments about the different Oral-B brush heads, I bought the sensitive heads (have a lot of crowns) and only used those until about two months ago when I started using the Pro-White brush head in the morning.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Oral-B 4000 Toothbrush after returning the 5000 model because of a broken and very tedious to use timer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4000 toothbrush is identical to the 5000 model and in fact also the same as the older Oral-B top models (I had one I bought about 5 years ago that needed to be replaced and it is the same in every regard). So no technical updates whatsoever, except that the display on the handle has changed slightly: It now retains the information for a short time in case it gets turned off and quickly turned on again whereas before if one accidentally turned off the toothbrush (or wanted to check the display without the brush running and splashing toothpaste all over the bathroom), the information was gone. I.e. if I had brushed my teeth for 1 minute 45 seconds and turned off the brush, the brush did not retain that 1 min 45 seconds and simply started over. Now if this happens, it picks up exactly where I left off which I find a definite improvement over the old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that - the same design, solid built quality and different brush modes that Oral-B toothbrushes have had for years. The only thing that regrettably has changed is the travel case. My old brush had a very nice fabric case. The 4000 and 5000 models sport this flimsy plastic case that I cannot see lasting very long at all. As a matter of fact, it doesn&#x27;t even have real hinges, the \\&quot;hinges\\&quot; are just slightly thinner pieces of plastic that will inevitably break sooner rather than later. Also, when I received the toothbrush, a small piece from inside the travel case had already broken off. It does not compromise usability at the moment but it just added to my impression that Oral-B cut considerable corners when designing this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the fact that this 4000 model has a small charger stand and does not take up valuable counter space with compartments for spare brush heads, etc. I would still prefer the 5000 model if the timer had a usable design but I am unwilling to have to take off the stand and battery cover of the timer whenever I need to adjust the clock, etc. So for now and until Oral-B comes up with a better separate timer, I will happily use the 4000 model - likely with my nice fabric travel case though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.5 stars if that were possible.take off the stand and battery cover of the timer whenever I need to adjust the clock, etc. So for now and until Oral-B comes up with a better separate timer, I will happily use the 4000 model - likely with my nice fabric travel case though...     3.5 stars if that were possible.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the product.  It works very well. It has the features that I was looking for: 2 minute timer with 30 second interval beeps, pressure sensor (lets you know if you&#x27;re pressing too hard), rechargeable battery, and small brush head.</li>
    <li> This was to replace an older Oral-B version. Happy  with this version. Has 4 speeds (I only use 1), has a much  more compact charger, battery lasts longer and the travel  case is very good. Has digital screen to sjow jow long  you brushed whoch I like. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I like the carrying case and the new 39 second beeps. These beeps encourage me to distribute my brushing equally throughout my mouth.</li>
    <li> Bought as a replacement for an older model that finally gave out. Love using it everyday. Only wish I could adjust or turn off the timer feature.</li>
    <li> I bought this when it had like a $50 MIR so after everything I got it for about 50-60. But even for what it goes for now (about $100) I still feel like this would be a good purchase. I have only ever used the floss action head but my friends who have used other heads tell me the floss action is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery is still strong as ever, charging works perfectly, and I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for 2 years 9 months now. I bring it with me when I travel without the charger and it works for like 4-5 days no problem.</li>
    <li> German ingenuity...I owned two &amp;#34;Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean electric toothbrush&amp;#34; before. This unit cleans much better. The rechargeable battery lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Very good product, works great, your mouth will feel a HOLE LOT CLEANER</li>
    <li> Replaced my Sonicare with the Oral B, after reading reviews. It believe it cleans my teeth well. However, there are a number of design problems with which I am dissatisfied. They are:&lt;br /&gt;tends to fall over,&lt;br /&gt;noisy,&lt;br /&gt;bottom retains some toothpaste, leaving a white mark on the bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Newer version of the last one I left in a hotel.  This one stops and starts if I press to firmly which is both annoying and beneficial but more beneficial given the point is to take the best care of my teeth and gums. I travel a lot, the case keeps me from picking up a humming suitcase.</li>
    <li> This thing is a power house. After my old electric died I figured I&#x27;d better get a new one. They&#x27;ve really improved over the years. This thing sounds like it&#x27;s power cleaning your teeth. I got a couple of different heads, one standard and one for deep cleaning.</li>
    <li> I am a real stickler for oral hygiene, so this toothbrush was a good choice for me.  It was actually a replacement for another Oral-B that I&#x27;d used for nearly 10 years before it met the end of its useful life.  I really like this toothbrush.  It&#x27;s powerful and has many settings and features which are upgrades to my previous version.  My only complaint so far is that I often find myself accidentally changing the type of brushing I want to have (i.e., regular, deep clean, massage, whitening) in the middle of a brushing session.  This causes me to have to scroll through the settings to get back to the original one.  Fortunately, the technology in the brush allows it to remember where I was in the brushing cycle once I return to the original setting, so it doesn&#x27;t start over.  For me, the placement of that button could have been better (it&#x27;s exactly where my thumb rests while brushing).  And, in case you&#x27;re wondering, I don&#x27;t have beefy thumbs or practice bodybuilding!</li>
    <li> Really good and long battery life. Product arrived on time and in perfect condition</li>
    <li> Replaced one I&#x27;ve had for over ten years.  Every bit as good as the first.</li>
    <li> I replaced the Precision 1000 and couldn&#x27;t be happier. The red warning light for brushing too hard is so useful for me. With certain brush heads I was brushing much too hard and this has trained me to brush more gently. It&#x27;s also more powerful than the 1000 and leaves my mouth feeling extra clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over 4 years now and still growing strong! It recharges in a reasonable time and also runs a good time between charges. I&#x27;ve replaced the head several times (normal) and it keeps going. More importantly it stands up by itself when not in the charger. I especially like that it came with two different tips so I could experiment. I like the tip with the build in dental cup in the middle, the best. You will not be disappointed with this purchase!</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t find the refill brushes in my location. The toothbrush works well but doesn&#x27;t shut off...keeps going from 1-4, then sometimes just 1 and 1...etc  Don&#x27;t know what that&#x27;s about nor can i find any answer to this in the accompanying literature.</li>
    <li> I bought this after having been using the Oral-B 9400 brush, which is still working.  When compared this 4000 to my 3-year-old 9400, both on a full charge, the 4000 felt a little bit weaker, which is weird.  Both are supposed to be pretty much the same, but my old 9400 feels a bit stronger; of course, it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge nearly as long anymore.      Another feature, or lack thereof, that I&#x27;m disappointed in is no display of the timer; it just pauses every 30secs (or 45, depending on the chosen mode).  My 9400 displays the timer and pauses as well.  It&#x27;s harder to keep track of how many pauses it has been without having the timer to tell me how long I&#x27;ve been brushing.  I should have bought the 5000, which has the timer; but I wonder if it feels weaker than my 9400, just as the 4000 does.  All 3 of those are supposed to have the same speed, oscillation, and pulsation, but for some reason, my used 9400 feels stronger.</li>
    <li> I just received my toothbrush. I was supposed to receive the 50% off promotion, however, on the fron of the box it only says \\&quot;$15 off dental visit\\&quot;. Is my 50% off in the box? I do not want to open it if is not inside. How do I know I am receiving the promotion??</li>
    <li> It does the job I wanted plus it is an exceptional product in its design and performance. I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> I had been using Sonicare for years but switched to Oral-B Profession Care SmartSeries 4000 and I love it.  I loved the Sonicare too but prefer the round brush on the Oral-B. After using this great product, you will feel like you just had your teeth cleaned and polished after every use. Do treat yourself with this amazing product and keep your gums healthy as well.</li>
    <li> My teeth are the cleanest they have ever been.  Even my dentist commented on how good they lokked.  I liked it so much I&#x27;ve bought two more for both my teenage children.</li>
    <li> Having never brushed with a power tooth brush before it took a few brushings to get used to this machine.  However, now that I&#x27;ve been using it for almost one month I can unequivocally say that this is the best tooth cleaning I get outside of the dental hygienists chair.  It&#x27;s been almost a month and it is still running off of the initial charge.  The motor is strong and consistent and the brush head does work in between the teeth better than a manual brush.  My teeth feel cleaner than when I use a manual brush.  In addition, I&#x27;m no expert but I think this brush is easier on the teeth enamel and gums as well.  I&#x27;ve raved about it to my father and he got one and likes it as well.  A bit expensive for a tooth brush but if it lasts years it will be worth it.  Highly recommended product.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace our old basic Oral-B that finally died.  Wow.  My teeth feel so much cleaner after only one brushing.  I gave it only 4 stars because of the new timer method.  I preferred the old, 2-minute timer.  Now it slows every 30 seconds to indicate moving to the next quadrant.  I don&#x27;t need the toothbrush to tell me to move on as I keep the brush moving around my mouth the whole time.  Now I have to count and keep track of the 30-second warnings.  One thing that surprised me is that it did take a full 24 hours to charge the first time.  When I woke up this morning and it was still charging, my first thought was \\&quot;uh oh\\&quot;.  I called the help line number that was in the booklet and she told me it could take a full 24 hours the first time and it did.  Don&#x27;t know if all the modes are necessary and will probably always use the daily clean one.  This is our third Oral-B electric brush and I&#x27;m sure the next one will also be an Oral-B.    Update after hubby informed me I was not paying attention to the timer.  After the first quadrant there is one beep, after the second two beeps, etc.  Since I understand the timer now, I have given the brush 5 stars. The manual should include much more information than the bare bones it presents.</li>
    <li> Recieved my oral-b in just two days.  Works great, but what I love the best about is the cleaning it gives.  Surpasses brushing with a brush.</li>
    <li> Pros: Ergonomic handle, charge indicator bars, angled brush head. Brush modes.  Cons: Charger base not compatible with previous Oral B power brushes. Long time to develop full charge. Brush mode can only be selected after starting the unit. Charger can only be used in the US (previous versions could be plugged into 220 V outlets as well).  I have been using this product for about 2 months and I am very happy with it, but I only rated it with 4 stars due to the cons described below.  I have been an Oral B customer for many years.  I purchased the product to replace my very reliable Oral B Ultra which lasted a good 6 or 7 years.  I selected the 4000 model based on other reviews and I am happy to confirm that I agree with them, particularly the comments on the 5000 model vs. the 4000.  There is no need for the wireless gadget.  The product has a built in timer which briefly stops the brush head every 30 seconds so that you know when to move to the next quadrant in your mouth.  Save the extra cost and use it to buy additional brush heads.  I like many of the design changes implemented since my last model, but I do not care for the requirement to change the brush mode after the unit is started.  It is hard to see the icon light up when you have the brush head in your mouth, so you have to guess what mode you selected while the timer is running.  It would have been much better if they allowed you to select the brush mode before starting the unit.  I am also disappointed with the charging base.  It takes almost 24 hours to fully recharge the unit. My previous product only took a few hours.  In addition, and just like others reported, I cannot get 10 days of use before recharging.  I am getting 5 days at best.  The charger base is oval shaped and therefore not compatible with previous versions. It also only works with 110 volts.  This creates a problem for me since I often travel to other countries and therefore cannot charge the unit while I am traveling.  The old chargersworked with any voltage between 110V and 240V, so you could plug them anywhere in the world by simply carrying a plug adapter.  Other than that, you will likely be happy until you need to buy new brush heads (the unit comes with one).  They are terribly expensive!</li>
    <li> Love this electric toothbrush as it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean after each use.  Very flexible in using any of the four cleaning options depending on what you may have eaten during the day and your ability to choose the appropriate cleaning option at your fingertips.</li>
    <li> Seems very powerful compared to my old toothbrush. Holds a charge well.</li>
    <li> It works, and I think my gums are getting healthier as a result as well. The travel case and induction charger are nice additions that obviously had some thought put into them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head doesn&#x27;t spin like a drill, it rotates maybe 30 degrees in each direction (clockwise and then counter-clockwise) very quickly. This isn&#x27;t what I expected, but I trust Oral-B knows what they&#x27;re doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing about using this is there are two slits on the brush attachment stem (no idea why they&#x27;re there) that have a tendency to pick up and spray mouth juices wherever they please, so you&#x27;ve really got to be over a sink to do this. No walking around and brushing with this thing!</li>
    <li> Have had the Oral-B for a month and am so completely happy with this electric toothbrush.  It cleans really well.  Some might find it a little powerful, but I like an electric toothbrush that has some power behind it.  It keeps a charge for a long time, which is also really important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put...GREAT toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This unit replaces one I have had for 15 years and served me well. I like the sleek look and carrying case. I do and do and do not, if this serves me like the last, anticipate buying another one. I will will this one to my husband.</li>
    <li> I have been using it faithfully since I received. My teeth do feel cleaner but the only drawback is the noise this makes while in operation.</li>
    <li> I used an Oral B electric toothbrush for many years before switching to a Sonicare. My dentist recently told me that my gum sensitivity was being caused by the Sonicare, and that some dentists are beginning to see evidence of the ultrasonic waves causing increased sensitivity and receding gums. So I switched back and bought a new Oral-B. It gets your teeth really clean (especially with the whitening-style replacement head), but it is louder and clunkier than the Sonicare. The battery does seem to last a long time; I&#x27;ve taken it on week-long trips without it dying.</li>
    <li> Wonderful..beats Sonicare.</li>
    <li> It is a good product with a couple different modes and a lot of different tips to try. The deep clean mode feels great and you can feel the clean it actually gives! I would recommend the toothbrush and it is a good value.</li>
    <li> A good step up from my older Oral B,s.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Strong, fast brushing action.  4 30 second timers actually do help to brush by quadrant,minimizing hand twisting.&lt;br /&gt;3 lite charging status should alert for any charging problem long before the bush stops.  My older Oral B,s have lasted &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34; with the only failure being a charger after 20+ years.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  fthe 4000 handle is much larger than my earlier models, requiring big hands or a change in tactics.  I used to brush randomly all around my moth until the 2 minute alarm.  Now I appreciate the sp second intervals so I work one quandrant of a time that allows me to chnage grip just once (my quadrants are outside left upper &amp; lower, inside right upper &amp; lower, change grip - outside right, finally inside left.</li>
    <li> Noticed immediate difference.  Coffee stains disappeared ! Great product.  Purchased a second for my teenage daughter.</li>
    <li> These are simply the best in my opinion.  They will last for years if this reflects past products of near same specs.  Have been happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is the best in the market.I have 2 of them.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush so I really have nothing to compare it to but so far, I&#x27;m pleased and I can definitely tell a difference compared to manual tooth brushing.</li>
    <li> Works very well! My dentist recommended this when my manual brush just wasn&#x27;t cutting it. It works well for me because I tend to be over-aggressive when I brush and this brush turns red and makes a noise when I press too hard. The replacement brush heads are affordable too, so you&#x27;re not spending an arm and leg when you need new ones - and they last about 3 months. My dentist was VERY impressed and my teeth are the whitest the have ever been. Definitely worth it for what you get.</li>
    <li> I like it but it tends to really rock your head a lot more than my sonic care. Does seem to get my teeth really clean. Much better than a manual toothbrush. Shipping was really fast for here in Costa Rica.</li>
    <li> I like the toothbrush; cleans really well.  Didn&#x27;t  need the travel case.  Too bad I had to pay for it.</li>
    <li> This is my second one and I especially like the beep every 30 seconds or so that reminds you to move on to another area of your mouth.  You also get a red light if you press to hard. The stand holds four extra heads which is a major convenience for keeping track of your extras.  This device has evolved nicely into a new and improved product over the years.  My old one still works after many years but I just had to try the latest model and am glad I did.</li>
    <li> Not buy this product. They sent me a brush without the LED display. It is impossible to know in what way this use. I live outside US. I can not return. The battery is of short duration. Disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I liked the Oral-B toothbrush but I didn&#x27;t care for the brush head.  I liked my old brush head that I had on my former Oral-B.</li>
    <li> I love it, keeps my teeth clean and white. Only needs to be charged every week.</li>
    <li> After 1 week of use I would recommend this to others.  Solid construction, interchangeable heads, good battery life and no cons as of yet.</li>
    <li> best money spent for this year ever :)  Highly recommend it   Improve the look of my teeth, I really really love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Oral B rechargeables for quite a long time now.  This one is the best yet.  So good in fact, I bought one for the wife.</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush from the recommendation of my dentist.  Great product and easy to use.  I am very happy with my purchase, two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Bought this at the recommendation of my dentist and I love it.  A little difficult getting used to as the brushes are very different from the Sonicare I had been using.  It does a very good job of cleaning however with my tartar buildup.  Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Oral-B since receiving it. I am very pleased with it. It makes my teeth feel really clean. I also use it to message my gums. I would recommend this product to anyone that is interested in purchasing a cordless tooth brusch. It is a A One product. The unit is very comfortable to hold in your hand and take no pressure to use.</li>
    <li> I had the previous version, 3D Excel, that lasted about 8 years before finally stopped holding a charge. I was anxious to see if the newer versions kept the quality I have come to expect from Braun. The look and feel of the toothbrush hasn&#x27;t changed much including the charging station. It seemed to take longer to charge initially, but the claim that it lasts 10 days (2x/day brushing) is absolutely true. This version comes with a convenient travel case that can hold 2 brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So far so good....</li>
    <li> Instructions say to remove batteries when device no longer works. But removing batteries BREAKS the device.  Batteries are REMOVABLE, but not REPLACEABLE.  Unless a device absolutely must be the smallest possible (ex. some cell phones),  How many iPODS and iPHONES have been replaced when new batteries would make them work like new?</li>
    <li> I nice electric toothbrush and like former models.  However, where the earlier models would beep and keep on running to let you know when the 30-second internal was over, this model completely stops running as a means of signaling the interval - very annoying.</li>
    <li> Only the life span of battery is poor</li>
    <li> Stopped working with no reason after 80 day</li>
    <li> I never knew how much of a difference an electric toothbrush would make for my teeth.  My teeth feel cleaner throughout the day since using this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints about the toothbrush are all of the extraneous settings.  Seriously, I can never imagine using all of these settings.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t spent all the extra money on the 4000 model and had just gotten the 1000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend an Oral-B electric toothbrush to everyone, but urge everyone to not get the fancy one that you probably don&#x27;t need.</li>
    <li> I had an old oral -B professional tooth brush with a separate timer piece for time and it had a problem with one of it&#x27;s lights and was not fixable.&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this one and I really like it. The light if one brushes too hard is right on the handle and comes on bright red.&lt;br /&gt;The different settings are also on the handle as well.  And it is lighter in my hand.</li>
    <li> I have the older version of this Oral B electric toothbrush and it was dual voltage so you could travel with it on a business trip overseas and have absolutely no problems. I made the assumption that this version was also dual voltage and found out that it can only be used at 110v in the USA. This was surprising considering the company that manufactures Oral B is Braun which is a German company. I am assuming this is one of the &amp;#34;corners&amp;#34; that were cut as well as only having one brush included to keep it at the price point it is currently. This was my biggest disappointment in that I travel a lot and now have to use a regular toothbrush on long trips or find some voltage regulator while I am overseas. Otherwise, the brush works just fine.</li>
    <li> This is my only toothbrush.  I have been using Oral B electric toothbrushes for about 15 yrs. i FIND i CAN GO FOR A YEAR BETWEEN visit to the dentist.  I use to go every 4 to 6 months.</li>
    <li> Works Great.  As expected.</li>
    <li> I like this brush. I also have the 5000 with the digital timer display. I do not find that useful. Just another piece of clutter on the counter that uses a battery. It&#x27;s definitely not worth paying extra money for. The toothbrush &amp;#34;stuttering&amp;#34; is sufficient without me having to turn my head and look at the digital counter display.This 4000 series is also quieter than the 5000 series. The 5000 series is louder and the toothbrush head vibrations seem coarser to me.</li>
    <li> 14 hours to recharge after a single use ... more that 24 hours after multiple uses. This one is being returned.</li>
    <li> Replacement heads are expensive (many times more expensive than high-end manual toothbrushes like the Oral-B Pro Health CrossAction).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush can take a long time (about a day) to recharge.  As a result, I&#x27;ve had days where I would fall back to a manual toothbrush to avoid interrupting the recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pressure sensor and warning light are nice; one of the main reasons why I decided to try an electric toothbrush.  However, the sensor measures the pressure applied to the handle and not the pressure applied by the brush to the teeth.  E.g., when trying to squeeze the brush head in to get the teeth in the back, my cheeks may press the brush hard against my teeth/gums without triggering the pressure warning.  The warning is also only visual (through a red light) and not audible (sometimes I like to close my eyes when brushing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I miss the tongue cleaner on the back of my manual toothbrush; a feature that this electric toothbrush is missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 30 second timer with a beep at the end is nice, but I wish it would give me some more indication so that I can pace myself.</li>
    <li> Woah. This thing has horsepower. I&#x27;m used to a lower end model of the Oral-B / Braun toothbrushes. This thing is impressive. It&#x27;s solidly built and has a great weight to it. This may make it heavy for some people, especially when holding it up for two or three minutes, but to me it feels good. The materials are top notch for a machine made of plastic and metal. It seems to be well built and intended to be a long-term purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case is handy.</li>
    <li> Works well.  My teeth and gums feel clean.</li>
    <li> Very nice! It has just what you need! It cleans your teeth very good and it has the whitening option. You really don&#x27;t need anything else.  I&#x27;m sure of that beause I bought the 7000 model too. And it does exactly the same! But is a lot more expensive. Why? Just because has bluetooth, premium travel case, and tongue mode. You really don&#x27;t need anything of that, you will waste your money. I really recommend model 7000 more than any other model that just add useless stuff for more money.</li>
    <li> Works great!  This is replacing an old Oral B that gave me many years of fine service.</li>
    <li> I bought this tooth brush over 2 years ago and am still in love with it. I have tried the sonicare electronic brush in the past and was not crazy about it and went back to plain old traditional tooth brush. When I received this brush and tried it for the first time I immediately fell in love with it and had a seemingly better brushing experience where I felt like i got a real deep clean brushing. I was a little nervous how big it is but that does not effect your brushing experience at all. It has a number of different brush modes and what i like most is that it has a timer to let you know when you should move to a different area of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have tried a number of the different heads that Oral-B offers and I have ended up using the larger heat that looks like it has two pieces to it. I feel like i get a more complete brushing. This is such a great product. Not only that the dentist has noticed a difference especially on my gums. I would highly recommend this brush to anyone!!</li>
    <li> Works well. Found a good coupon on the manufacturer website which made it affordable. Replacement heads not as expensive as other brands.</li>
    <li> Works great don&#x27;t need all the extra stuff like more expensive models</li>
    <li> I returned this because can not use internationally. Only uses 110 V. At least that is what the package said after I got it. But could not find anywhere in the description.</li>
    <li> We have used Oral B for six years and would not use any other type of electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> A gift to my wife. She says it is \\&quot;OK\\&quot;.  But she is still getting used to it.  If she continues to use it I would give it more than 3*&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This brush puts all my previous brushes to shame.  It feels like the actual dentist brush and makes a huge difference.  Previously I had a battery operated Oral B brush and had to pull it back out for a recent trip.  It was awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the precision brush head and the dual action head.  My husband uses the floss action.  We both like it and the brushes.  I feel that the precision head might have done a little better but the dual action head is also a little big for my mouth so that could be the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Great brush, leaves mouth clean, timer works great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: A little bulky, not particularly ergonomic grip and it can be difficult to the tooth paste to stick to the small heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Still working and holding up well 11/13</li>
    <li> This is an excellent toothbrush that should last a lifetime. I am very pleased with its performance and I like the quadrant notification.</li>
    <li> After several weeks of use I&#x27;d say I do like the toothbrush.  However it definitely took some getting used to.  If you&#x27;re not gentle it will rattle your cranium.  Once I learned that I didn&#x27;t need to be near as aggressive as with a standard toothbrush that went away.  I love that it lets you know when you&#x27;ve spent a set amount of time on each section of your mouth.  Very handy.</li>
    <li> I had an older model that was slowing down and this was really an upgrade. Reall makes my teeth feel clean. the 15 second stoppage is a little annoying but I can live with it.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift to my daughter and her husband.... Although I thought it was a good gift, I thought it might not be very exciting and they wouldn&#x27;t appreciate it.  Turned out they they love it and thank me all the time for giving it to them. Travel case is especially appreciated.</li>
    <li> Just got back from the dentist after using this for 6 months and they noticed a huge difference especially in my gums. I just bought one for someone that happens to be under my insurance and I think they will keep our dental costs down in the long run. Every thing has worked great for the 6 months that I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
    <li> {I like this Toothbrush very much. I had one that was similar and it lasted a great number&lt;br /&gt;of years and this one seems even better.</li>
    <li> I have used Oral B and Sonicare both and speaking just from a position of comfort and overall clean feeling, I prefer the Sonicare. This toothbrush works well, the battery holds a charge for weeks at a time, and the replacement heads are really easy to find, both made by Oral B and the generic alternatives.</li>
    <li> Great Unit!  Very happy with it</li>
    <li> I have used an Oral B for many years now and just upgraded to the ProWhite Precision 4000.  I previously owed the Vitality version and really loved it, but after having this new model for a week,  I now know what TRUE LOVE is. This version has more power and beeps when it is time to move to a new quadrant in my mouth. It also has a sensor that shines red to let me know I am applying too much pressure. My teeth feel &amp;#34;slick&amp;#34; when I am finished brushing - the same way they feel after having my teeth cleaned by my hygienist!  I also love the tray where I can take my brush off and store it covered after I use it, and what&#x27;s not to love about the spifforific travel case.</li>
    <li> Great product, as I expected.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  Left my old charger at a hotel and this has been a great replacement.</li>
    <li> Bought this for our son. Likes that it has a timer so that he knows how long he needs to brush.  Hold charge well.</li>
    <li> There are so many things to love about this product and it is definitely money well spent.&lt;br /&gt;As a hygiene fanatic, I decided it was time to invest in an electric brush to keep my teeth pearly white and clean and I am so glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few great things about this brush:&lt;br /&gt;1) Great battery life (I usually have to charge it every 2 weeks or so)&lt;br /&gt;2) It cleans your teeth and removes plaque so well (when I rub my tongue over my teeth I can&#x27;t feel any left over residue and it feels like I just got a teeth cleaning from the dentists office)&lt;br /&gt;3) There is a smiley face indicator when you have brushed your teeth for two minutes so you know the job is done!&lt;br /&gt;4) It is dependable, I have been using the same toothbrush for 2 years now and it has yet to fail on me (fingers crossed)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, high powered, leaves my teeth feeling cleaner than with cheaper electric toothbrushes. I like the 30-second beeps, they ensure that I&#x27;m brushing all parts of my mouth equally.</li>
    <li> It has three modes, you can brush your teeth very clean, my first time, very satisfied. I would recommend it to my friends</li>
    <li> Works as expected - plus it has several different cleaning modes.  It replaced a previous version that died, but this one is even better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a rodeo in my mouth, but I assume it would probably feel like this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace my Oral-B same model whose charger died. To replace the charger was $75 and I bought this for about that price after a coupon - thinking that the charger would work on my old one too. Sadly, it doesn&#x27;t. I went about two weeks with a regular toothbrush and I just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore! Once you go electric, you never go back... But I do love this new toothbrush. The pressure sensor is great. I was amazed at how light I should be brushing. My older model didn&#x27;t have that. I am disappointed with Oral-B that my charger didn&#x27;t last very long on my old model (owned about 5 years) and it was so expensive to replace (I won&#x27;t deduct a star for that since this is a slightly different model). So far so good on this new one.&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used an electric toothbrush - it is amazing. Your teeth feel so much cleaner. It took me awhile to get used to the bulkiness of the electric toothbrush at first but now that I am used to it a regular toothbrush feels so foreign to me. I also love that it has a built in quadrant timer so you know just how long you should be brushing each quadrant - an it signals you to move on to the next area.</li>
    <li> I took a chance and ordered this product sight-unseen.  Although more expensive than my older electric Oral-B toothbrush, it is far superior in performance.</li>
    <li> I have used Oral-B electric toothbrushes for years and have found that the 4000 model is exactly what I need. There&#x27;s really no added value to more bells and whistles. This toothbrush does the job and at $65 with the coupon, is a steal!</li>
    <li> Great Toothbrush with the timer,although it is a little noisy when up early for work trying to be quiet</li>
    <li> This Oral-B Precision 4000 is better than the more expensive version I have purchased prior. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> no complaints - reaches all the right spots and whiten some of my yellow spot</li>
    <li> This product does not seem as good as the last similar one I owned, but is good.</li>
    <li> Works well and does not take up too much room.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B was quite a disappointment.  It runs slowly.  The motor is weak; it slows even further with the least bit of pressure.  It takes about 10 hours to recharge after three uses. The brushes are impossible to get under the gum line for better cleaning, and i have had some gum problems after started using it.</li>
    <li> Oral-B is my go to for complete oral care. My teeth are simply sparking and I recommend this brush to anyone concerned about their oral care! Your dentist will will be happy!</li>
    <li> Love how clean this brush gets my teeth so clean. I want to buy another one for my boyfriend but the price spiked :(</li>
    <li> I have always like the cleaning I get with Oral-B electric toothbrushes but some features like the brushing timer and bright red bushing indicator light drive me nuts.  I also wish they offered a user replaceable battery.  They figure it&#x27;s disposable when the battery no longer holds a charge and they show you how to remove the soldiered in battery before you dispose of it but it would be just as easy to make the battery replaceable.  I tried to replace the battery on my old brush and destroyed it!  I guess they are more interested in making a buck (also obvious in the cost of the replacement brushes!) than protecting the environment.</li>
    <li> Delivery was quick but item was not appropriately supplied.  The wrong power connections were supplied.  Apparently only North American connections are sent out, even when returned and replaced.  A second set, exactly the same as the first error, was supplied. It seems that whatever information is supplied to them, it makes no difference.  Consequently, postage finishes up to be worth more than the article purchased.  Now I have none of the items (which were supposed to be Xmas gifts) and no refund or correct replacement.  Thanks Amazon.  Very disappointed.  No direct contact point to sort out the issue either.</li>
    <li> I replaced an older Oral-B toothbrush that I liked a lot.  This one, not so much.  1.  Even at the lowest speed I select, it literally seems to shake my upper jaw apart.  2.  The footprint is much larger than it needs to be (a definite minus in a small space) and it does not provide a great way to air dry a wet brush (possible, but not good).  3.  The base is concave so water puddles there and must be sopped up.</li>
    <li> I should have purchased the toothbrush years ago.  I look forward to brushing each day.  The last gadget i tried was water pic.  Over 40 years ago.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and am very happy with how it cleans my teeth and removes tartar.  I love the flossing brush....really seems like it gets between the teeth.  Use the polishing brush also...........just not as much as the flossing one.  It lasts long on a charge so you can take it when u travel.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why a tooth brush needs to be a home decoration accessory! Seriously ugly design with cheap looking plastic accents. You know what&#x27;s cool? White. Make them white. What ever happened to cool functional understated german design?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s a wonderful product which i&#x27;m perfectly happy with ... mechanically ... but it still makes me roll my eyes every time i look at it.</li>
    <li> Highly rated, works great, reasonable price</li>
    <li> Love it. Just wish brush was larger</li>
    <li> Excellent quality product</li>
    <li> It has  been awhile since I bought a new electric tooth brush.  I thought I&#x27;d try this one and I am quite impressed.  Even on just the regular speed it is much better than my old one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for a while. The replacement heads aren&#x27;t too expensive. My teeth still feel clean even after years of use. I used to use sonicare and took some getting used to but still felt like it cleaned my teeth better than a regular brush. Battery has, so-far, lasted a lot longer than my old sonicare. Mine looks like the brush with the lcd on the bottom and not the one with just the lights.</li>
    <li> This purchase replaces my old Oral-B electric which died after several years of use. Rated it 4 rather than 5 stars cause they changed the size of the base just enough so it won&#x27;t fit on my old base - which I prefer. Otherwise cleans teeth just as well as the old model did which is excellent. Much better than a manual toothbrush. Leaves your mouth/teeth feeling so clean.</li>
    <li> My dentist once asked if I scrubbed my teeth with a lot of pressure, which, of course, I did.  I wanted to get my teeth clean.  I was told that was more of a hindrance than a help, however.  The description of this toothbrush said that it turns red when too much pressure is exerted, and it does exactly what it said.  It&#x27;s definitely helped me become more aware of how I&#x27;m brushing.</li>
    <li> We had an Oral B electrick toothbrush for years before and it just recently died but I have had it for at least two years and used it regularly.  Best thing I ever did and cleaned my teeth better than any regular toothbrush can do or ever did.  The battery finally got to the point that it wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore and went with the same company for the brush again.  Now its even better and sstronger and has different setting...not to mention it has a carrying case which is awesome since we travel a bit.  Also love that it has a place to store the toothbrush heads also.  Don&#x27;t second guess this purchase because of the price.  It will last long enough to justify the price and the quality is excellent!</li>
    <li> The cheapskates switched the charger to North American model only. The charger with the previous model of Oral-B I bought ~5 years ago also worked overseas. I wonder how much you saved by the change? 50 cents? Because you for sure lost me as a customer! Damn it that I noticed it only a few months after I bought the toothbrush, otherwise it would go back right away. Seriously, cheap shot Oral-B, I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been using this toothbrush for about four months and it&#x27;s been dependable and seems to work well.  We bought it to replace an older Braun model that finally gave out.  All four modes on the newer handle work fine and we don&#x27;t mind the momentary timer stops every 15 seconds.  We were also happy that we were able to use the basic brush heads we already had on hand, although there&#x27;s a dazzling array of more specialized heads available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawbacks we&#x27;ve noticed are: 1) that the base by itself is very light, narrow and unstable, but with the optional collar and brush head container it takes up a lot of counter space -- the old one was larger and heavier and needed no collar; and 2) it emits an annoying high pitched whine when it&#x27;s running which the old one did not -- until just before it stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, we&#x27;re happy with it so far and will edit the review if it proves to be short-lived.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Use it every day.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush. I&#x27;d probably get the next step down from this version if I were to buy again. However, this is a great toothbrush!</li>
    <li> This is a high powered tooth brush. Feel nice and clean after using this. It comes with a covered brush head holder, 1 brush head, a travel case for the toothbrush and a recharger. Will be using soft brush heads with it so I don&#x27;t ruin my teeth.</li>
    <li> Came in perfect condition.  The toothbrush works better than the Sonic Care toothbrush.  My teeth feel really clean after each use and my gums don&#x27;t hurt like the Sonic Care. So glad I bought this. My dentist said my teeth have never looked so white and clean.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Like it. Works great. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the noise the machine makes is DUPER loud compare to my sonic are. Other than that, it works for what it&#x27;s made for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used inferior electric rotating brushes. $20-30 price range. Well, the last one I had broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read all the reviews and opted for this one, over the most expensive upgrade model with the smiley screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little back-story that ties into my review. I&#x27;ve always had bleeding gums when I brushed because I just don&#x27;t floss. Can&#x27;t stand it, and don&#x27;t have the time/patience to pick around in my mouth. Brush my teeth twice a day and that&#x27;s it. (8 years without a dentist and no cavities, while eating sugary candy at least once a week)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after using this item for a few weeks. I noticed my gums stopped bleeding when I brushed my teeth. This is definitely due to the brush and it&#x27;s first setting&#x27;s power. I mean, it really has a nice cleaning motion. Sometimes so strong, that I gag from all the toothpaste it throws around to the back of my throat while I brush my molars. (I know, I know. TMI)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the power of this brush is outstanding. My teeth look noticeably whiter, super slick clean feeling. I enjoy the 30 second pause cause most likely before this brush, I&#x27;d probably only brush for a minute to a minute an 15 seconds. I know, I&#x27;m a terrible adult when it comes to dental hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that it takes a whole day to charge this unit, and that&#x27;s every 4-5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall. I&#x27;d recommend this brush to anyone who has the money to shell out for it.</li>
    <li> Very good as expected.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, 1 charge lasts a long time, small brush head allows you to get in tight spots!  My dentist recommended going with an Oral B Professional Care Electric Brush.</li>
    <li> Nothing beats Oral B!</li>
    <li> Excellent cleaning with the flossing head. holds charge for 3 days +/- for 2 people x 2 times a day. Much better than the sonic cleaners. Not newest tech but works better.</li>
    <li> Works great to clean my teeth.</li>
    <li> I converted to this product after a long run with the Sonicare Elite system.  I think they do an equivalent job of cleaning, and they all have different models with different bell sand whistles  My problem with the OralB system is that it makes me drool.  I know that sounds odd, and it is.  There&#x27;s a hole in the brush head half way down that communicates with the head, so saliva can escape you mouth and run down your hand or on to the floor.  I ten d to walk around as I brush and I leave little drops here and there.  It&#x27;s kind of gross.</li>
    <li> Nearly 5 years later, it&#x27;s still going. The battery should probably used replacement, but will simply replace and get a new brush when the battery dies. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Product as described. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Very pleased so far. Nicely weighted and angled.&lt;br /&gt;Red lights you if you brush too hard but you&#x27;d have to be very aggressive to need this alert.&lt;br /&gt;Someday they&#x27;ll come with a replaceable rechargeable battery.</li>
    <li> Work well.  I have a small problem, The input power is 110v.  My power supply is 230 volt.  I have to use the charger from my previous toothbrush.</li>
    <li> It is difficult to hold a d the charge set-up is rather large for small shelf space.</li>
    <li> This replaced a smaller Oral-B powered toothbrush, which lasted three years. This one does a much more thorough job. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve had this for 3 years now, and throughout those years, everything was working great.  However, I started noticing that the battery only lasts a few days (compare to weeks when it was new). In short, great product, but expect to charge this frequently to get the maximum cleaning power.</li>
    <li> I have had an electric Oral B for about 15 years so when it finally needed  to be replaced I chose the 4000 after much research. I really did not expect much difference but I was pleasantly surprised! I loved the way my teeth felt after the first brushing and I did not find the noise to be excessive. I wish I would have purchased it sooner.</li>
    <li> Very Good! I love it!</li>
    <li> I have great oral health (never had a cavity or ortho work, etc) but started getting stains 1.5 yrs ago when I started drinking tea. My hygienist suggested I use an electric toothbrush so I finally gave in &amp; decided on this model right after my last dental cleaning. I have not seen any positive effects with regard to whitening or stain removal. I&#x27;ve taken pics almost every day after I use this &amp; I only see the usual buildup of stains. I&#x27;m a very careful brusher &amp; have discovered I take about 3.5 minutes to brush ... electric or manual ... which brings me to the 30-second pause feature on this model. UGH! Very annoying to have to pause every 30 seconds &amp; a bit longer pause at the 2-min mark (the toothbrush pauses for a couple seconds). Oral-B has a policy where you can return the item within 60 days for money back &amp; I&#x27;ll be doing that ... &amp; going back to my regular, MUCH less expensive manual brush since I see no difference</li>
    <li> Small heads helps focus a tooth at a time. The in built timer also helps to figure out how much time I should be spending.</li>
    <li> Great improvement over other types of brushes.  Dentist noticed the difference right away.</li>
    <li> After owning this toothbrush for only 4 months it will no longer charge. Very disappointed.  We have an older model that lasted over ten years.  Would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Bought it for the kids to use- works great, and they brush longer (and better)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pricey but I can definitely tell a difference and the hygienist is happy. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2 years now and it still like new.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush!</li>
    <li> My son says his teeth have never felt cleaner!</li>
    <li> This was my favorite toothbrush. The battery is almost impossible to replace (youtube). Before I purchased another electric toothbrush, I checked each and everyone for battery use vs. a rechargeable battery.</li>
    <li> It‘s a very good toothbrush！</li>
    <li> Love the rotary action.  Cleans teeth to where they feel dental clean.</li>
    <li> Best electric toothbrush yet.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Has all the needed features.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it as well as my other Electric toothbrush...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare Essence for years.  Recently I tried Oral-B 3000 and I immediately thought that my mouth felt cleaner with Oral-B than with Sonicare, so I purchased Oral-B 4000, which is a step up from 3000.  I chose the ProWite version specifically because it comes with a whitening head, although the head can be purchased separately and fitted to other models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this toothbrush with Colgate Optic White, Crest 3D white, and Sensodyne Extra Whitening toothpastes randomly, and I believe my teeth look whiter and some of the tea stains along the gumline have been reduced.  This brush has features that are really useful rather than \\&quot;bells and whistles\\&quot; that manufactures occasionally add to their products simply to demand a higher price.  Feratures like various strength brushing modes, quadrant pacer, and pressure monitor, are important to me and I am glad that this model has them.  I like that the top of the brush behind the brush head lights up red if I press too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I do not like about the brush is that the battery is not replaceable.  It is really a shame because I disassembled a 3000 series brush, and replacing the battery could be an easy procedure.  Unfortunately Oral-B chose to solder batteries in their toothbrushes.  Even so, replacing the battery is possible and not that hard, but you would have to buy the battery from a third party.</li>
    <li> Great -- my teeth feel so good!!!</li>
    <li> Great tooth brush, still going strong after 6 years of use. Will gladly buy an Oral-B again. Love the 30sec timer and it really does clean better than a manual tooth brush. Careful not to use too much pressure, though (the tooth-brush has a sensor, but I would say that it&#x27;s not quite sensitive enough) and I would recommend a soft tooth brush - it still cleans really well and is safer for your gums.</li>
    <li> faster than the one I had purchased 10yr ago. Very happy I purchased another one again.</li>
    <li> I am very unhappy with this toothbrush.  It is big and noisy and too rough on my teeth.  I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy that the batter has lasted weeks on a full charge. I don&#x27;t use the charging station to keep my toothbrush propped up because it takes up too much space in my opinion (I don&#x27;t need the side compartment for multiple toothbrush heads).&lt;br /&gt;The experience was strange at first but I quickly favored this over manual because it&#x27;s so much easier for me brush the teeth in the far back.&lt;br /&gt;This product has product has multiple brushing modes that I don&#x27;t care to use but if you want to brush your gums or have sensitive teeth, those modes may be important to you.&lt;br /&gt;The pressure sensor that stops the brush seems to be dysfunctional. The brush stops multiple times during each brush when I&#x27;m not even pressing down. But I can randomly press down hard and it doesn&#x27;t stop. Maybe mine is defective but is probably user error.&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this product feels and performs like a quality toothbrush should. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Oral B for two years now and love it! The battery still holds a full charge and can still go 3-4 days without charging (used twice a day) which is pretty good. For a quick overnight or two, you needn&#x27;t bring your charger. Six months ago, it could go a week without charging. As described, the toothbrush vibrates when it&#x27;s time to switch zones or quartiles when brushing, a very useful feature. The heads wear out consistently between 3-4 months, exactly as stated by the manufacturer. Every time I go to the dentist they remark at how clean my teeth are. This toothbrush definitely does the trick. And I love the waterproof, non-metalic charging system.  Highly, highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Worked flawlessly for almost a year now...</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve only used normal and deep cleansing mode.  Having each quadrant timed has helped me focus on cleaning my teeth better by spending more time brushing and more focused cleaning.  It works as described.  Not sure it&#x27;s worth the hefty price tag.  Surely this thing can be made for less than $20.  My only complaint is when using the same side hand as the teeth being brushed, it&#x27;s hard to get to the inner teeth.</li>
    <li> I replaced an older model of Oral-B which I had for a good number of years.  Much improved with added features.&lt;br /&gt;Makes toothbrushing enjoyable and thorough!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with electric brushes, well you can, by buying one for way to much, that has nothing included. But rest my friends, this one is not one of them. Will features like different modes, and 30 second reminder, nice rubber grip, quiet, and comes with a carrying case.</li>
    <li> House full of clean teeth, children love brushing now, this brush has made it fun for everyone.</li>
    <li> I finally bought this after my dentist recommended an electric so that I don&#x27;t overbrush--which causes your gums to recede.  First, it&#x27;s just really well made.  Second, it&#x27;s really comfortable to use.  I end up brushing far longer than needed since it&#x27;s almost like giving your mouth a massage.  Probably TMI, but I usually brush in front of the TV for 5+ minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lied to my dentist and said I was still using a traditional brush, and on top of that I hadn&#x27;t gone to the dentist in a year since I&#x27;d started using this one.  Dentist said the teeth looked great and to keep up whatever I was doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note, you really should dry the head completely before putting it back on the charger.  Otherwise, it&#x27;ll drip down to the charger base and get some garden variety mold on it. Can start to smell if you do that.  Also, about once a week I take the head off to clean off the gunk in there.  Minor cleaning but worth it.</li>
</ol>
