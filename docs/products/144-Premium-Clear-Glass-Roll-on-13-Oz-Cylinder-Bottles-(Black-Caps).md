    <li> These roll on bottles are great for mixing essential oils with carrier oils and apply to skin easily. The sky is the limit. Mixing thieves oil with a carrier oil and apply to hands, then rub together, the cup your hands over your nose to inhale this awesome mixture for flu prevention. Very effective. Very fast delivery. I will use this company again.</li>

    <li> I ordered about 500 bottles and almost half of them leaked. I found this out after I filled them all. It cost me about $1000 of time and expenses. The company is very hard to contact and their website is difficult to use. I tried leaving feedback on their website but it&#x27;s impossible. I also order the device that helps insert the filament into the glass bottle and it was poorly made. The bolts become lose after a few uses and it&#x27;s mounted on plastic which already started braking after the first use. Overall I would not recommend this company.</li>
