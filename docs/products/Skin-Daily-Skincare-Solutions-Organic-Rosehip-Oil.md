<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The rosehip oil is wonderful.  I&#x27;ve been changing from warm climates while traveling to cold and damp at home.  The rosehip oil has given me hydration and my face looks bright.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This stuff has helped my skin so much. It softens and helps stop breakouts!!</li>
    <li> The product works well. As the other reviews say, I have noticed that my lashes are getting longer (I bought the product for that main purpose), but I also don&#x27;t notice my acne scars lightening very much. However, I&#x27;ve only used it for a little over a week, so I can&#x27;t say if it is working yet. The product has a strong smell. It caught me by surprise, honestly. It smelled not very pleasant, but it is organic, so I can&#x27;t argue with it. Overall, the product is great. I normally use about 3-4 drops in the palm of my hand and I don&#x27;t find that it dries or absorbs to quickly. I like the product!</li>
    <li> what pleases me most of this oil is that with a little I can apply to my entire face, and with a light massage on my face all over my skin so completely adsorbed , there is no oil residue , but my skin is hydrated all day. has a slightly odd smell fishy at first but then when this absorbs disappears. my skin is so soft and moisturized now</li>
    <li> The rosehip oil is working wonders for me. I have added it to my daily regimen and have seen reduction in oil and breakouts. I found that two drops isn&#x27;t enough for me. I have virtually replaced my moisturizer with this product + rose water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: At first I experienced what seemed like in increase in breakouts. It was the oil doing some deep cleaning! Now things are all good.</li>
    <li> This oil is fantastic! It&#x27;s beyond amazing and my skin has done a total 180! I have struggled with acne since age 11 and have tried every skin care/makeup brand under the sun. After finding this product, I only wash my skin in the evening and immediately put Rosehip Oil on my face/neck. In the morning I splash my eyes out (not my face) and reapply the Rosehip Oil. I no longer have oily skin and whenever I feel/see a breakout coming (which is almost never now!) I immediately put oil on the specific area and it&#x27;s gone overnight!</li>
    <li> I bought another bottle.  I love how this feels on my skin, my skin seems to beg for it. I am not flaking off dry skin as I usually do in the winter.</li>
    <li> Had been using pure rose oil + coconut oil to get rid of dark spots and scarring in chin area for several months then heard about rose hip oil and tried this brand.  Within 10 days I noticed a big difference.   9 months later -- i switched to the Jarosa brand because they had a good sale and it has the pump bottle which works better for me than the dropper.  I keep mine inside the fridge door so to just open the fridge and do 1 pump is so convenient. I keep the above dropper bottle now for travel. Pretty much all the brands are probably good but its the pump bottle that I&#x27;m sold on.</li>
    <li> I am starting to see improvements on my eleven lines and forehead wrinkles.  My overall skin tone is improving and the redness on my cheeks is starting to fade.  Can&#x27;t wait to see the changes after I finish this bottle!</li>
    <li> Cannot tell is it&#x27;s good or not. There is no significant change on my skin.</li>
    <li> This Rosehip oil is wonderful.  Love the feel and scent on my skin, and I am seeing some slight lightening in dark spots.  I will continue to use, as I enjoy massaging on my face and neck, and in conjunction with my moisturizer, my skin has become less dry.</li>
    <li> Pure and clean. I recommend this oil for anyone who wants to avoid creepy chemicals on your skin.</li>
    <li> I love, love how this Rosehip serum feels on my face.  I can definitely tell the difference after using it more than a week!  I can definitely tell the earthy smell, but it will dissipate fast (once it is absorbed in your skin).  The seller is very nice and she emailed me the literature and explanation of the normal earthy smell of the rosehip and its benefits for your skin.  I really love it!  Go ahead and try.</li>
    <li> I noticed it worked immediately. Only improves with daily use. I&#x27;m 66 and perfect skin. Only slight rosacea left. After I waxed my face was red and sore .  Immediately this took out redness and skin has a glow to it now as well. Definitely if not the best..one of the best. I&#x27;ve also used Christina Moss&#x27;s products. They&#x27;re excellent as well. But I like this better right now. Her face cream does relieve bags and healed my blister under my nose immediately. However I think this one worked faster. Loved this stuff.</li>
    <li> Used this twice, then got rid of it, couldn&#x27;t stand the smell and makes the lines on skin look worse .  It was waste of money for me because it also has an orange color that sink into the lines.  Don&#x27;t waste your money, also smell like fish not a pleasing smell to put on your face. Will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It does exactly what it says...</li>
    <li> Terrible fishy smell. Despite a reviewers comment in the Q&amp;A section that the fish smell will go away, I have not had that experience. Unfortunately missed the 30 day return window, hoping the smell would improve.  I do not recommend this product unless you don&#x27;t mind smelling like fish if you apply it to your skin, even in small amounts.</li>
    <li> I am sure many have seen my reviews as I am a facial product addict.  But I think I finally found a product worth every penny!  I research products carefully and do not ONLY rely on Amazon Reviews.  There are so many products on the market so it can be a confusing experience to find the right one.  There are a few reasons why I like this particular product. 100% organic is one of them. Now many objective articles (meaning not written by a company) state although the higher end products may produce results a bit faster..let&#x27;s face it (excuse the pun), they are full of chemicals that we do NOT know the long-term (risky) effects they can cause.  But  studies show Roseship oil is wonderful for your skin and I prefer to apply an organic product than one that has a long list of chemicals and preservatives. I am 60 years old and have fairly good skin (I STOPPED tanning before my adult years) but have a few deep wrinkles that bother me. Now I have been using this rosehip oil for only a couple of weeks.  I compared it to a cream with Matrixl 3000.  The rosehip oil won hands down! My skin glows all day and I am not exaggerating!  Although it leaves a oily feeling for about an hour, my skin has never been so soft!  Do I detect some wrinkle reduction? I want to say yes but to be honest it is a bit too early.  I would apply it as part of your night regime BUT if you have no plans to go out then definitely use it as your morning regime. And you need only a few drops to cover your face, neck and decolletage area. I still use a organic serum of 20 % vitamin C  E Ferulic with peptide, plant stem cells and hyaluronic acid (I am sure some of the ingredients other than the vitamin c and e are lab created) But this should NOT be used alone.  After cleansing, I apply the serum..allow it to absorb and dry and then use the rosehip oil. Another PLUS is a very pleasant employee named Lisa has followed up with me via email several times.  How many companies do this?  I told her I was going topurchase another bottle for my disabled son who has inherited his mom&#x27;s dry skin and I received an email from Lisa stating she was sending the bottle for free!  Again, how many companies do this?! Rosehip oil will always be part of my facial skin regime.  Recently I impulsively purchased some \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; facial cream for my son.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the NATURAL label...the product is full of chemicals!  (Bad me!  Should have read the ingredients first!) And I shook my head at the reviews for this product as most consumers thought it was an all natural cream! What you want is 100% Organic Rosehip oil that is COLD PRESSED.  And this product&#x27;s price is much lower than many brands. A $40 bottle of organic rosehip oil is the same product with this more reasonable, lower price  Do your home work!  Here is a link to an article in the Huffington Post published in 2013. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/07/rosehip-seed-oil-benefits_n_3375871.html  Do your skin a favor and try this product. I am sure the majority will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  It  does not require just a drop but a drop on each part of the face.  Even though I have very dry skin, It hydrates it for quite a while. It&#x27;s worth buying</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I have been using it for maybe 2 weeks and I can tell the difference. It is fading all my dark spots. My skin is clear and people start asking me what I am using. You should give it a try.</li>
    <li> I JUST got this, today, so the review is a tad bit premature, BUT - I love:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The color of it - orange&lt;br /&gt;* The smell of it - fresh, earthy and pungent - not fishy, at all.&lt;br /&gt;* The way it simply melts into my skin, with no greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I used it, I refrigerated it, as it recommends on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shall update this, after I have used it awhile, but my first impression is extremely positive.</li>
    <li> As I have healthy skin I thought to buy this as more preventative rather than for need. After using this product my skin began to burn and I then broke out in a rash from my hairline to my neck. Within the following days I had pimples and my skin felt dry and tight. I had to visit the dermatologist where I was given two prescriptions to help relieve my condition. Now some weeks later my skin has fully cleared and no scarring was left. Just to make sure, I placed a small bit again above my eyebrow area to have the same burning results as to which I carefully and quickly removed this product. I am not condemning or saying this product isn&#x27;t up to par but I know I do not have sensitive skin nor do I have any allergies as I had to go for testing. What I do know is that this product is not effective for me and causes extreme dermatitis issues.&lt;br /&gt;By all means have a go as it doesn&#x27;t hurt to see if this might work for you but I would suggest to do a test patch to see how your body reacts to this. Better to be safe than sorry with extra expense.</li>
    <li> As soon as I started using this on my face at night before bed, I noticed my eyelashes got longer and thicker. Smells like fish oil, small price to pay, after it&#x27;s on for a few minutes , you don&#x27;t smell it anyway.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I do love this product.  I use it mostly on my face and hands. My face is combination oily and dry and this is not too oily.  I like the consistency and the way the product absorbs into the skin.  Thank you, I have enjoyed adding it to my beauty regime.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> After using this product for one week, I began to see significant changes in skin discoloration and dry lines.  My skin felt and looked hydrated but not greasy. My skin literally drank in this serum. I keep it in the refrigerator and I use it mainly at night but I sometimes add a few drops in the morning to my moisturizer.  I truly believe its helping my aging skin and will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> AWESOME!  If has a slight odor but it smells earthy not fishy at all... doesn&#x27;t bother me and the amount of hydration if delivers I don&#x27;t care what it smells like.  I won&#x27;t use any other moisturizer.  Soaked in and my makeup went on flawlessly... I did wait to apply makeup for 10 minutes.  I plan to lather this stuff on my entire body as we have pretty harsh winters in WI.  I will never go without it.  I also added a drop to my mascara so fingers crossed my eyelashes will start growing!!!  Thank you!~</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! My son gets extremely dry skin in the winter and I have tried several lotions with no luck.  The Rosehip oil has cleared up the dry skin anf reddness in only 5 days! I have bought 2 more bottles for family members.</li>
    <li> helps with the itchiness of my scar.</li>
    <li> This stuff does wonders!! My eczema got really bad. I put it on 2 times a day!! Thank God for products like this. I&#x27;m no longer itchy.</li>
    <li> Its a great product and skin is showing considerable improvement.</li>
    <li> did not do anything. I was told to buy another bottle.</li>
    <li> Used this for my stretch marks. Finished the bottle and they are still as red and big as ever.</li>
    <li> I have super dry skin and this oil is amazing for getting rid of flakiness! It&#x27;s also lightened my acne scars really quickly. Love it! I&#x27;m ordering another bottle!</li>
    <li> Wow! I really love this product! My skin is really oily as it is but my sister recommended rose hip oil, and this brand and price was so great so I gave it a shot. So glad I did. Not only is it not greasy on my already very oily skin, but the scent is light and it feels great. Your skin will absorb it really quickly which is great for those rushed mornings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend buying this! The company also has great customer service which is always a plus! :)</li>
    <li> Great product and quality</li>
    <li> Love this oil! I&#x27;m a cancer patient and some of the drugs I am taking have weakened my fingernails and caused them to split. There are supplements that address this but they require months to have any effect, I needed something to deal with the splitting right now. The oil prevents splitting after just a few days use, although the nails are still weak and thin, they are much improved!&lt;br /&gt;I also like it to use on my hair to make it shine, now that I have kinky hair after growing out after losing it from chemo. It&#x27;s also great on my aging skin, reducing the fine lines and &amp;#34;crepe paper&amp;#34; effect.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and it shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I love the organic rose hip oil. At first i wasn&#x27;t sure about buying beauty related products on Ebay. Im so glad i did. It left my skin feeling so soft. And surprisingly enough i never break out from this rose oil. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> You can feel a difference in your skin after just a few uses.  I am very please with this product.</li>
    <li> This oil is fabulous for my aging skin.  I have ordered it several times because it works.  I have also tried other brands, and this one stands out in quality.  My eye area is softer and so are my wrinkles.  It is easy to use and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my skin. Stung and made me break out.</li>
    <li> I noticed that I could use this on scars and for dandruff so I decided to see if it would actually work the way it said that it would. I have been not only using it on a few of my scars but also for dandruff. I started using it first on the worst of my scars the one I have on my lower right leg. I had a compound factor of the right leg over 10 years ago and it caused a huge scare. I have tried everything to try and diminish the look of it or at least make it softer looking. Nothing really worked the way I wanted until this stuff. I have been using it for a few weeks now, everyday when I get out of the shower I use some on the scar. It absorbs nicely into the skin and before the scar has a tight scabby feeling to it where the skin was dry and flaky. Now the skin in much smoother and the flakiness has been diminished. It doesn&#x27;t feel as tight and actually feels much better to the touch. As far as the way it looks. It looks much better. I am a very pale person and red spots look 10 times more red on pale skin and the scar had a lot of redness to it. It seems like a lot of it has gone away since starting to use the rosehip oil. I am most definitely going to keep using it for my scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came to the dandruff I didn&#x27;t like it as well but it was my own not liking. It worked well at treating the dandruff and I could tell it was working but I hated putting it into my hair. My hair is very oily but my scalp stays dry. It&#x27;s a horrible combination and I have to be careful of products I use because of this. The rosehip oil will work great for a lot of people who don&#x27;t have to worry about hair like mine but every time I used the oil it made my hair look greasy and oily like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in weeks. Which, is normal for a lot of hair products that my hair doesn&#x27;t like. While it does work and really helped stop the dandruff, my hair hated it and it really made it look horrible. However, it&#x27;s one of those things that as long as you wash it out every morning before beginning your day, it honestly isn&#x27;t that big of a deal. It does work and that&#x27;s what matters.ng your day, it honestly isn&#x27;t that big of a deal. It does work and that&#x27;s what matters.</li>
    <li> I love this but I keep it in the refrigerator and it is not as convenient as I hoped.  It has a small odor that is not exactly pleasant and I like to use it at night and the fridge is on the other side of the house so I don&#x27;t use it as often as I want.  I am usually trying to get to bed in a small amount of time!  I need to work on scheduling my time better!</li>
    <li> Since I didn&#x27;t see any results after buying one bottle of this oil, I&#x27;d gave it another try with a second one. After finishing it, I&#x27;m not noticing any improvement on my expression lines. Unfortunately, this product didn&#x27;t work for me as I expected based on the ad and some reviews.    Wish you luck w it!</li>
    <li> Yes, I have noticed improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> A slightly nutty oil, rosehip has been perfect for keeping my aging skin clear and keep my wrinkles at bay. I apply a few drops to my fingertips and rub into my face after cleansing in the morning. The oil does not feel greasy , it is nice and light and does a great job. My skin is super clear, and looks healthy and bright. I keep my bottle in the fridge to help keep it fresher, longer. And, I love that the bottle is amber to keep the ingredients (rosehip oil) fresh. The dropper is easy to use and control the amount of product on your fingers.</li>
    <li> I received one bottle of a 100% Organic Rosehip Seed Oil to review!  This Rosehip Oil is a 100% organic, so you don’t have to worry about any nasty chemicals in it, which I think is a real plus.  If you’re looking for a skin care product that has rejuvenating properties, then you’ll love this Rosehip Oil!  It really doesn’t have any fragrance, but it certainly gives your skin a smooth and silky feeling.  This Rosehip Oil has been proven to firm, restore, hydrate damaged skin and irregular skin issues, like eczema, psoriasis, dermatitis, acne scars, dark spots, fine lines, wrinkles and sun damaged skin.  Making it hard to find previous scars, as well as fading age and sun spots on the skin.  It can even help stretch marks fade away!  Rosehip Oil is among the most powerful regenerating and rejuvenating skin oils in existence!  To me it sounds like the perfect beauty product and it&#x27;s organic!  It’s even good for dry hair and dandruff, along with brittle nails. This is another one of my favorite products, that I would stand behind and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Using this on my stretch marks, as it lay claim to helping them diminish away.  It took a few days but then i started to notice some results in that area.  This product helps, I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle oil or anything, but it actually helps.  This company is amazing as well! They have great customer service if you have a question, and they ship their products out quickly and with no hassle. I love this product, and will be trying the Rosehip oil on my daughters eczema as well!  Heres hoping it works great for that as well!</li>
    <li> I hate that this didn&#x27;t appear to work for me because they&#x27;re customer service was so nice. They contacted me right away, answered any questions, tried to find solutions at all cost. I just didn&#x27;t see enough results to say, this is a keeper. It may have helped some but no distinct difference, not even in the eyelashes as it&#x27;s been reported. I think it made my eyes water. It wasn&#x27;t my salvation unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I previously purchased another item from this buyer and now again am very impressed with their excellent customer service and quick delivery.  I have heard a lot about Rosehip Oil and am very anxious to try it out.  I will follow up in a few weeks and give some additional feedback.</li>
    <li> I add it to my daily face moisturizer and it definitely keeps my skin hydrated and soft without clogging my pores. Those are the improvements I&#x27;ve see so far, hopefully over time it will continue improving my skin in other ways. I will most likely be ordering it again when I run out and even sent the link to the website for my mom to buy a bottle as well. I&#x27;m very happy with the product, it was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I tried some of this serum after my sister bought and said it was good for acne, eczema, and dry scalp. I put a couple drops on my finger tips and rubbed it in my skin. After a few days I noticed my acne scars going away. It Also helped clear the eczema that I had been battling with for a while. I also rub some of this through my scalp and I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in my scalp and reduction in dandruff. I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product and recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love how this felt on my skin and I received it quickly.</li>
    <li> Gives a luminous glow without that shiny look. Absorbs quickly.  Exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for to lightly moisturize.</li>
    <li> Lightweight option for moisturizer. Didn&#x27;t make me break out and seems like a great alternative to expensive moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I went into this a skeptic, so for me to rave about it, means it is really awesome.  I went to the Dr. &amp; remarked how old my hand looked.  He suggested Rosehip Oil.  I put a few drops on each hand at bedtime.  I keep it on my nightstand so I don&#x27;t forget to use it.  My hand look so much better it&#x27;s unbelievable.  I then take the oil that is on my fingertips and rub it on my face...I figure I got nothin&#x27; to lose!!  I plan to buy more for my family &amp; friends.  One word of caution..the label says it keeps for 6 months &amp; it should be refrigerated.  I don&#x27;t refrigerate mine cause I&#x27;d never remember to use it everyday.  It&#x27;s better to work through the night so you are not washing it off all day, if you are using it on your hands as I am.  I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I have something to say about my new found Rosehips!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m.. 60 and take care of my skin, but, this product is fabulous!  It has minimized my pores and refined the texture in such a short time. It absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t look greasy.  The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, I apply it over my witch hazel/rose water toner.</li>
    <li> I am giving this product a four star as I have just started using it and will rate again after using it for a month or so.  As of right now it seems to make my skin feel soft but I use it along with another oil.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing oil. It never leaves a greasy feel. Feels so smooth on my face. I have dry skin so  sometimes I mix it with my moisturizer. Use With or without makeup. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Just received this product.  It is truly lovely.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy look to my face as it absorbs quickly.  I&#x27;m even using it during the day.  You only need 2-3 drops, and I combine it with a 100% Argan Oil to apply AM and PM.  My skin feels lovely and I am hoping I will notice a difference in tone and keeping the wrinkles away that are starting to pop up around my eyes and lips.  I tried a different Rosehip oil previously, I found it sticky -this is a beautiful oil - I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Hello! This is my personal e-mail to the company. After purchasing my product I spoke to Lisa after she had e-mailed me asking about the quality of my product. I had a great and surprising experience that I decided to tell her my story. She has been so kind and I was motivated to copy my e-mail as a review. I hope this helps anyone with a similar problem, and that you all enjoy. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my e-mail....&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I have seen results from the rosehip oil. My sister-in-law recommended it to me because I was allergic to the coconut oil, which I was using for stretchmark prevention. Due to the allergies I began using the rosehip oil as a replacement. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6 136 pounds and in my 6th month and 1st pregnancy. It was important to me not to get stretch marks, and so far so good I&#x27;m loving the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where I noticed the most surprising effect from the oil was on my face. I have been struggling with acne for some time with some red blotchiness and cysts right on my cheeks. I also have had some pretty dark circles under my eyes. They showed up when I began college, and it has been a battle with expensive products, right regimens etc... I was using proactive because it worked the best, but I noticed that the lotion and toner from the proactive line was a little harsh on my skin, so I would just use the facial cleanser. However, using that alone would also dry out my skin tremendously, and using lotions would either irritate the acne or not work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got the rosehip oil I researched it, and from what I read it said it was good for the face. I didn&#x27;t expect anything because nothing has worked so far (not even the coconut oil), but I began to use it along with my proactive cleanser to at least attempt to settle the dryness on my face. I began using it every night once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first 2 weeks I noticed the redness in my face had gone down. In the third week the acne started clearing, and after a month the circles under my eye were diminishing. Mind you this isn&#x27;t because I was testing it I was just noticing these changes week by week. I&#x27;m 26 and there some light lines on my forehead and under my eyes, but they also faded. By now I don&#x27;t know when exactly it happened my face is a lot brighter with no acne, reduced scarring, pores and a lot more vibrant really! At first I thought I had imagined it, but people just kind of randomly made comments on my skin saying it looks great asking me what I use, sort of confirming what I thought. It was really exciting because I never get comments like that and like I said I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything at all.  I&#x27;m also a lot more confident I don&#x27;t feel like I have to pour base foundation on my face just to feel comfortable going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I didn&#x27;t know what to expect I figured the oil would just keep off stretch marks I had no clue it would transform the surface of my skin the way it has. I really haven&#x27;t had skin like this since I was a teen, so it was definitely a great experience with the product and I&#x27;m a gratefully surprised... I never thought I&#x27;d find something that would be so easy and effective. Anyway I hope this helps I don&#x27;t have a before and after picture because I never took pictures showing my face, but I will be purchasing your product again and I do tell my friends about it, especially when I&#x27;m asked.</li>
    <li> The smell is horrible, like a 10 day old fish!</li>
    <li> I used exactly as directed and in three days my face dried up a hundred percent and left red blotchy painful rashes all over my face.</li>
    <li> This product is superb!  The quality is the best. I use it for eczema on my hand, and has noticed a remarkable improvement in the frequency of my flare ups. The customer service is the best I have ever experienced! I was contacted at least once before the package arrived thanking me for my purchase, then again to let me know my package should be there (which it was) and then a few weeks after asking how I liked the product. All of the inquisitions were genuine and sincere, and displayed a genuine  concern for my satisfaction! I can&#x27;t say enough about how pleased I am with my experience with this purchase!! Will be buying again and again!!</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed this oil, it really has seemed to make my face feel so much softer and the texture smoother.</li>
    <li> I am using it and I like it very much.  Thank you for such a wonderful product and such good service.  I have noticed subsequent to purchasing the Rosehip oil how rare it is to find quality as good as yours.  After using this product for two weeks, after cleansing morning and evening, I notice a distinct difference in my skin.  The tone is much improved, as are fine lines.  The deeper lines around the mouth have become much softer and less noticeable.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for an effective and affordable skin care product.</li>
    <li> I am so excited about this product. It leaves my skin smooth, bright, and helps soften the hard lines of wrinkles. It is a light oil with a pleasant, nutty scent. Several drops go a long way. You can almost feel it working on your skin. I look forward to results over a longer time frame.</li>
    <li> Rose Hip Oil has been healing the dry skin on my hands and fading the scar on my wrist which has bothered me for years! Using it nightly at bedtime.</li>
    <li> I have been using it and I must say my skin feels smoother and looks more radiant.  Also my hair was itching like crazy and I put a few drops of the oil on my scalp and massaged it in and the itching stopped.  I like it and a few drops go a long way. :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this product a while go. I haven&#x27;t used it as much as I should, but it really helps my skin. It does have a really weird scent when you first try it, but smells better after you let is diffuse a bit. I will continue to use it and see how well it does.</li>
    <li> This product is magnificent from every angle. I use it nightly on my face before applying moisturizer. This oil makes my face look refreshed and vibrant the next day, regardless of how much sleep I have had or not had! On the odd occasion that I do not apply it, you can see it my face the next day, my tone is blotchy and skin uneven. The seller is reliable, professional and ordering is an ease. I cannot imagine a day when I don&#x27;t use this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Gressy....I apply it to my eye creams, potions and lotions....hope to see results soons</li>
    <li> I love this oil!  I just started using it, but already I&#x27;m seeing a difference.  I&#x27;m using it on my neck and chest as well as a booster to my eye cream.  I have not experienced any breakouts at all.  Since I&#x27;m typically prone to breakouts, I&#x27;ve been a bit conservative in using it all over my face.  But so far, so good!  I use it on my hands as well.  Great oil!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Leaves your skin supper soft</li>
    <li> still using this product - bought it about 3 wks ago-brown spot on cheek is getting smaller, will keep using</li>
    <li> I have only used the rose hip oil a few weeks, but I already see a difference!  My skin is so soft and my makeup looks even better now - there&#x27;s a glow!  I&#x27;ve been having trouble finding an eye cream that I could tolerate.  I had an allergic reaction to an eye cream my dermatologist gave me several years ago and my eyes have been super sensitive ever since.  I can put this all over my face - even my eyes with no problem.  I have olive skin that scars easily and I can tell that the oil has lightened the acne scars as well.  I love this stuff!  I don&#x27;t leave a lot of reviews - just too busy - but the company has given me excellent customer service.  I will definitely order again and it will be from CSP!</li>
    <li> This Organic Rosehip Oil is amazing!  I keep it refrigerated and apply it every morning, at first I had a few break-outs but since has cleared and skin feels great. It really helps with the morning puffiness under eyes and I use it for my nails as well.</li>
    <li> I love this rosehip oil very much. This is the only skin care product I use after cleansing my face twice a day. No more expensive lotion &amp; cream. I had a little oily skin before, but now my skin is very well balanced.</li>
    <li> I agree, the smell is awful.</li>
    <li> 10 years younger in less than a week. Love it, so recommend</li>
    <li> This product is excellent, it helped reduce a scar in my shoulder and I noticed my eyelashes are more full.  I am now applying it  to some capillaries in my legs, I read it can help.  I know this is a long process but I am giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt; I like the company, every time I send them a question they give me an honest and prompt answer.I hope they develop a &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; serum, I will be first in line.  I already use their B3 and had very good results.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I&#x27;ve used it for over a month now and see some great benefits to my skin, it&#x27;s smoother, silkier and hydrated.  I&#x27;ve used a few other Rosehip oils in the past, the quality of this one far surpasses all others.  You&#x27;ll immediately notice the difference!</li>
    <li> Within less than a month, I&#x27;ve noticed my hair looks healthier and has more shine.</li>
    <li> packaged well and arrived immediately.</li>
    <li> I have tried using this product for months I can only put it on a few times because it stinks so bad like fish. People even remark what is that smell when I have it on I would recommend that you not buy this. I understand that pure rose solution smells fishy but I do not understand how people actally wear it.... unfortunately I waited too long to get my money returned. I was not able to take care of the return due to health issues.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this oil! I have been using this for approximately 2 weeks and my skin is dewey and soft. It does not make your skin oily. I mix with  a blend of  Meadofoam, apricot seed oil, and essential oils. Rose hip is a must have in a good anti aging blend! I use it by its self at night and I wake up glowing!&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping from this seller. Out standing service and a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> Skin Daily Skincare Solutions Organic 100% Rosehip Oil is the best I&#x27;ve tried.  This is the last product I use before going to bed on my dark spots from acne.  When I wake up my skin just glows, and looks better each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also helps with growing eyebrows, eyelashes, and healing fingernail cuticles. Nevertheless, I use it on my itchy scalp when nothing else will work. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just try not to run out of it, or you will see a difference right away.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this, my dark marks on my face are lighting up with any costly methods. I use after each shower or when I wash my face. </li>
    <li> after the eczema left me a lot of scars, i have been trying a lot of things to get rid off the scars. I found out that the rosehip oil is the best thing for that when I used this one. After applying rosehip oil on scars both on my arms, legs, and back, I could see the different in a few weeks. I just bought another brand to use but i dont think that one worked on scars, plus the color of that one was clear. The color of this brand is what the rosehip oil should be like. I will buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> I have been using it twice daily since the day i received it and it does appear to be helping diminish/lighten up those dark spots for me, yes.&lt;br /&gt;My hope with continued use of the oil is that it will almost completely fade away or extremely lighten those spots so they are almost unnoticeable</li>
    <li> This really is a very good oil.  My skin feels very smooth after applying the oil and is possibly lightening some spots on my face, although it&#x27;s too soon to tell for sure.  I would love it if that were to happen! And as others have said, it does make my eyelashes appear to be longer, although I think it&#x27;s the way the oil lays on the lashes rather than causing them to be longer.  That&#x27;s a very nice effect that other oils do not do.  I tested that to compare the difference and there definitely is a difference.  This is an excellent oil.</li>
    <li> This Organic Rosehip Oil is amazing I been used by three weeks more o less ,  My face look so much younger and  soft, ,IT  doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;fell greasy at all . even I use under my make up it give me a glow . I do recommended it .</li>
    <li> Great service, great product. Makes my skin feel like silk. I haven&#x27;t used long enough to see long term results but all n all ,I will reorder this product.</li>
    <li> Stumbling upon this oil and reading reviews,I had wanted to try it.Not only for myself,but my husband who has eczema.He has seen slight difference in his skin condition and as for me,I mainly wanted to see if it would help stimulate hair growth for my eyelashes like the other reviews said it did for them,but no difference for me.</li>
    <li> A++++  This is one of the best products I have ever used on my skin! Rose hip oil is a skin treatment secret I regularly share with friends and family.  Super fast shipping, unbelievably well packed, absolutely no issues whatever!  You can buy from these folks with complete confidence.  I will be shopping here again soon!</li>
    <li> I loved the way this product made my skin feel and I added a few  drops to my mascara and needless to say my eyelashes have grown!! :)&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll  have to try it for yourself. I recommend  it especially for dry skin!! Or even if you are just curious  as to what changes  will happen  when you try it!</li>
    <li> In just two weeks time, I&#x27;ve seen marks and spots on my face either disappear or become faint with the use of the Rosehip oil product.  I&#x27;m a fan of this great serum.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. Even though it is an oil it absorbs faster than any lotion or cream I have ever used. I put it on my body after I shower, in my hair and scalp and as a face cream when my skin is feeling dry. Daily Skincare has amazing customer service. I spent some time picking out rose hip oils before choosing to order through them, and the effort paid off. This company is dedicated to providing customers with top quality organic rose hip oil.</li>
    <li> The skin on my face is softer &amp; the texture is more smooth as compared to my regular lotion moisturizer. I graded 4 stars only because I don&#x27;t love the oil&#x27;s aroma.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been making my own body moisturizer and Rosehip oil is one of the ingredients.  I think this particular oil is a great price for the quantity and concentrate.  The customer service is also very personal and fantastic!</li>
    <li> So far so good! I got this oil with the purpose to disappear the horrible spots from my face. I got the product a week ago, so I do not see any results yet. However, my skin looks more fresh younger, softer and clean. The first time that I use it the smell was awful, but now I can handle it a little better. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad after all. I&#x27;ll update this info if I have any success disappearing my spots.</li>
    <li> makes my face feel very smooth but doesn&#x27;t smell too good</li>
    <li> This rosehip oil has significantly calmed my scalp psoriasis. I&#x27;m going to need a bigger bottle!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and as advertised. Great product for the price, girlfriend loves it for her skin. Will keep ordering again.</li>
    <li> I have been ordering this product for months now. every single time i start to run out i immediately order more. i have never been more satisfied with a product! this product works miracles!! i have acne and scars on my face and even after the first use i noticed a difference. i have found that rubbing the product deep into your skin before bed is the best method. i am extremely happy!</li>
    <li> Love it. I add it mo my oil mixture and use it on my face and chest.</li>
    <li> This oil is the best! In just three months it lightened up the dark spots my last pregnancies gave me. My skin is softer, has a nice glow, less wrinkles and my eyelashes and eyebrows are thicker and fuller! Also the skin of my hands and the nails have improved drastically! I just started my second bottle and I will continue buying! Thanks for the great products and prieces!</li>
    <li> I just wanted to say thank you for such a quality product!  I am sort of a skincare product &amp;#34;snob&amp;#34;, and must say that I am very, very pleasantly surprised at how soft and supple my already healthy skin felt the very next morning after just using this product for one night.  I will be ordering and sending some to my 79 year old mother, and I know that she is going to fall in love with it as well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again, and I look forward to seeing even better results with a little bit of time.</li>
    <li> I have been using Skin Daily Rosehip Oil for 4 weeks and will never be without it.  It has almost erased the facial scar that remained after my MOHS surgery a year ago.  But even better and more unexpected than that - it has smoothed and moisturized my skin leaving a beautiful healthy glow.  My husband has noticed - and that&#x27;s saying a lot.  I also started smoothing a few drops on my arms and legs right after taking a steamy shower.  Then I &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; it in with some shea butter moisturizer.  My skin feels like silk all day.  It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> Yes and I love it! I noticed an immediate improvement in the hydration and texture but the improvement to fine and not so fine lines especially around my mouth was amazing! I thought &amp;#34;let&#x27;s wait and see&amp;#34; if it&#x27;s just a reaction to a new product. Two weeks later and my skin keeps getting better. I use it all over my face, neck and décolletage, even around my eyes and lashes! My lashes seem to be getting thicker and longer! Sometimes I&#x27;ll layer it with other serums and creams and sometimes use it alone after a spray of rose water. It&#x27;s a terrific serum and I&#x27;m a fan!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great hydration for my dry, sensitive skin.  Good value for a quality product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! It&#x27;s amazing! I have been using it everyday since I received it and my skin feels so hydrated.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about two months now (each bottle usually lasts a month, give or take a few days) and I absolutely love it. I usually use it after I have just washed my face in the morning and then again at night. It locks in much needed moisture and gives me this lovely, dewy look without it being too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that my dark spots (post acne marks) are fading and my skin is firmer and overall more healthy looking. I no longer need to use foundation or any kind of makeup on my skin. I definitely recommend this, but don&#x27;t forget beauty also comes from within - drink tons of water and eat right and this product will do it&#x27;s part as well.</li>
    <li> I received this item in exchange for my honest review - opinions are 100% mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Rosehip Oil has a nice, pleasant scent which is not even remotely overpowering like other oils can be. I add a little to my skincare routine and my skin feels nice and soft. It has done wonders for dry elbows and is a great anti-aging oil. I do love the dropper as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THis item was received in a timely manner with no damage received during transit.</li>
    <li> I wondered what makes this Rosehip oil different from others? Their Rosehip oil is 100% pure from Chilean rosehip seeds and are cold-pressed to preserve its freshness. So, I had to put it to the test. I have been trying it for all sorts of things. I first tried it to moisturize my face, and I have to say my face has never been smoother. I even tried it for sunburn, and I significantly noticed that it made my sunburn not as bad. Usually, after getting sunburn I would peel for days. Using the Rosehip Oil made it so I didn&#x27;t peel at all. The only issue I had (which may not be an issue for you) was I didn&#x27;t like the consistency of how it felt on my face, but I solved this by mixing it with a facial lotion. I used Purlisse Hydra-Moisture Balance, but any moisturizing lotion will do. I noticed by doing that it absorbed easier as well as felt better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have tried other products and nothing is working, I would defiantly recommend trying this product and see if it helps. I&#x27;m not saying it is a cure all, but its defiantly worth putting into your skin routine to help minimize or get rid of some of the problems I talked about. They also having amazing customer service and ship fast! I got it within 2 days thanks to amazon prime and their fast service. Thanks for such a great experience!</li>
    <li> great natural facial product. Works on dark / age spots, wrinkles and has been used by Egyptians, american indians since the dawn of their time.</li>
    <li> I add this wonderful oil to my body oil to pump it up.Also makes an excellent night cream especially for dry lips</li>
    <li> I have been mixing 2 drops of the oil with my daily moisturizer before applying.  I love the way it makes my skin feel and how it stays moist throughout the day.  I have only been using this product for a short while.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this and have been using it on my face, neck, eyelashes and hands for a few days. I can already see a difference! My eyelashes look fuller and some of my acne scars are starting to fade. Not only that but I used it on my hands to help heal a burn that I got using my curling wand,  ouch! I know. I put it on at night and the next morning the redness was gone, it was amazing.  I&#x27;m going to continue using this product to help with scars and to lengthen my eyelashes. I&#x27;m certain that after prolonged use all my scars will be gone and my lashes will be huge. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;d like to say I wanted to wait a while to see if this oil really delivered. I have absolutely no access to laser treatments that combat fine lines because I&#x27;m African American (they can scar), AND I have not the disposable income for fillers, etc. I need a potion, lotion, cream, oil, or all four to help with my skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this golden, nutty smelling oil for approximately two weeks now and am thrilled! Already, there are reduced &amp;#34;expression lines&amp;#34;, smile lines, and that little annoying line below my eyebrows but at the top of the nose is GONE. Usually, a prescription retinol is needed to get such results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a primrose oil soap with a washcloth, hot then cold water (old school). I put a few drops of this wonderful oil and warm in my hands, pressing it into my face, then down my neck, etc. I use an anti oxidant cream (face, neck, decolletage). I do this twice daily, and I&#x27;m looking great in my late 40s. I&#x27;m getting really cute really quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Products aren&#x27;t designed for everyone, but please consider this non-greasy yet rich golden oil. You have nothing to lose, and you will find you&#x27;ll  be really cute really quickly too!!!</li>
    <li> Very, very pleased with this product! Not only is it working on my face, (and hands too!)--it is healing and curing a very stubborn case of dermatitis that even a course of steroids has not entirely cleared up. Especially, still left with some very annoying itching. Bad enough to still have to resort to using Benadryl. Now there Is hardly any at all. This oil is the only thing that has worked for me. This stuff is terrific.</li>
    <li> the rosehip oil did help with acnes and acne scars! the acnes on my forehead are much lighter now(they are not the hard, oozing ones, they are just small and red) and the scars on my cheeks are getting better. I&#x27;m actually looking forward to the effect on my eyelashes, yes i read the previous reviews! and now my face does not feel dry after clarisonic face brush. it&#x27;s just one thing, the tube does not seem good. it can not hold the oil</li>
    <li> I LOVE it!  I enjoy the scent (woodsy) and it&#x27;s very absorbent.  I use it on my upper face and eyelashes.  Lashes seem to be lusher, which was unexpected, and I love the moisturizing effect of the rose hip oil. i use it on my cuticles, which makes my nails longer and the ends of my hair.</li>
    <li> Great light weight facial moisturizer. Also I think this might be working to grow my eyebrows. I need to give it more time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil a couple of weeks ago and my bottle is already half full. So I ordered 3 more bottles. They have a promo right now, buy 2 get one free. *tip*you add a quantity of 3 to your cart and at the end put in the promo code and it deducts the cost of one of them from the total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my face every day and I love it!! I&#x27;ve used it on my scars, my hands, my legs, and the ends of my hair. It&#x27;s my go to oil. I was looking specifically for the Rosa mosqueta variety and most that are sold on amazon are the dog rose. Also, this company has amazing customer service. I contacted them prior to purchase to see if they had a tamper resistant safety seal and I was happy to see that they did. They were very helpful and friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is a dry oil and absorbs fast. I use it as my daily moisturizer and I don&#x27;t look too oily at all!! Must have part of beauty regimen!!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I love it. I have already bought 5 or 6 bottles from you. I have noticed improvements in my skin. Dark blemishes have faded, small lines have faded or are now non existent and I have only been using the Rosehip oil for a couple of months, if that!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> great product and great customer service. Im using it for new scars and it works great. Nice moisturizer for all over face as well. I&#x27;m still using, on my 3rd bottle. Great for most skin types, not greasy. Great customer service.</li>
    <li> I received this product free in exchange for an HONEST review (which my blog prides itself on). The first thing I like about Skin Daily Skincare&#x27;s 100% Organic Rosehip Oil is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong and irritating smell...just a slight, soothing fragrance. I also like the consistency; it isn&#x27;t thick and gloppy, but it isn&#x27;t so thin that it won&#x27;t spread, either. A lot definitely goes a long way! A few drops was enough to cover my entire face, and it didn&#x27;t dry up like some oils do before I had a chance to thoroughly massage it in. It was really oily at first, but after a minute or so of massaging, it absorbs in. I really liked the moisturizing aspects of this oil -- my skin feels so soft and smooth after using it! I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long, but I feel like it is helping reduce some of the acne and redness on my face. I haven&#x27;t seen any changes with my stretch marks yet, but I will keep you updated, as I&#x27;m sure that takes time. I also loved what the rosehip oil did for my hair. A few drops of oil was enough to calm my frizzy, dried ends and make them shiny again! I definitely recommend this product to anyone who loves natural solutions, and especially to anyone who could use it for both their face and their hair.</li>
    <li> I broke out from this</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my skin just yet but I do think my eyelashes have gotten noticeably longer and healthier as a result of using this in my mascara</li>
    <li> I finished this bottle but I don think it helped my blemishes. Smell wasn&#x27;t as bad as everyone described it to be.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because made my face all dry, I don&#x27;t think is good for your face. Anyway My nails are looking every day better, no kidding, just a little bit of oil after shower and helps a lot.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel very smooth and supple.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Love it... my boyfriend has some sort of dermatitis on his leg and I&#x27;ve been applying your organic rosewater and then the rosehip oil for about 2 weeks and it&#x27;s actually healing! Probably be gone in another week or two.  I gave a bottle to a friend who has eczema on her hand... it&#x27;s helping her too!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I’ve received it and I’ve been putting it every night.  I told my husband how great the product is and he started to used it.  He was telling me how he see a difference on his skin.  We both loved the product and plans to get more later.</li>
    <li> This product is AMAZING it has made my skin so much more even. And has taken away dark spots from acne. It also feels amazing on your skin! I will definitely be buying this again and I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Smells like spoiled fish, horrible, cNnot use it.</li>
    <li> What a great product!  I use this rosehip oil daily and my skin has improved quite dramatically.  Little by little, my wrinkles and creases are diminishing.  It&#x27;s not an overnight miracle...............you have to be patient.  I&#x27;m still quite impressed with my results so far.  I don&#x27;t use it at night because it&#x27;s a bit oily, but during the day, either alone or under my makeup, it works very well.  Now I&#x27;m going to start using it on the back of my hands and see if I see any obvious results on the age spots. I will keep you posted!  but, so far, this product rates 5 stars............thank you very much!</li>
    <li> The Rosehip Oil has been amazing and it has improved my skin tremendously in the eczema affected area!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel nice. I would recommend to anyone that has dry skin.</li>
    <li> The oil has improved my skin. Tone is better and lines less noticeable. Very pleased. Absorbs very well, not greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I order my Rose Water from this company and absolutely LOVE. I have ordered 7-8 bottles total of the rose water. Ok..I have never tried the RoseHip Oil and decided to give it a try.. Upon trying to find a reputable company to purchase my oil from for the future, This is about my 3rd bottle from 3 different companies.. My results: The color is true...(amberish/yellowish) as rose oil should be. The smell is fresh, earthy, nutty, and pleasant. (love this) I ordered from a company and the oil (though terrific results)...it smelled awkardly, awfully fishy. I used this on my hand to see how well it absorded and to see the texture it left. (Just got back home, and haven&#x27;t taken my make up off yet...so, yes..The back of my hand is justified). Ok. It absorded very well..The smell is yummy and kind of a little nutty (in a delicious way)... and my skin is immediately soft.(Which, in the elements I live in now, is so hard to achieve due to this cold weather. My skin is terribly dry especially my hands.&lt;br /&gt;I will update later after I start using it for my face, but thus far, I am very pleased with it and considering it as my number one go to company for my oil. I LOVE their water...So this oil is an added bonus..Will update later for overall results.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I wanted to try something natural and organically grown on my face. My skin is extremely sensitive. I have acne scars, some age type spots and an actual c shaped scar on my cheek bone. This product hasn&#x27;t given me a rash or any sensitivity at all. The smell isn&#x27;t bad at all. It just smell like an herb to me. It does dissipate quickly. I have had oily skin all my adult life and so moisturizing has always been a problem. This rosehip oil is actually making me feel good about my skin for the first time in decades. I have recently noticed my pores are smaller!  My skin texture is much smoother too. My husband turned and looked at me while we were riding in an ATV together one afternoon and said my face looked whiter to him.  He never notices anything really so I was excited about that because it must be evening out my skin tone and getting rid of scars too! I plan on using this from now on.  I love it!  The company is also excellent. They have emailed me several times asking me how I like the product and answering questions and also sent me a coupon for 30% off the next purchase.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using the rosehip oil for four days now and I’m so thrilled with the results. First, here’s some back story. I’m pregnant and grew an aversion to the smell of the cocoa butter I&#x27;ve been using for the last few years. I completely neglected my skin for weeks, but I was too sick to care. Finally, as the morning sickness subsided, I finally looked at myself in the mirror and didn’t recognize myself! My skin was pale, swollen, dull, flaky, all the faint lines looked like deep canyons. I felt hideous. I decided to order the rosehip oil on a whim. I knew I needed something deeply restorative. I have some seriously sensitive skin so I prayed I wouldn&#x27;t have a reaction as I tend to do. For the past 4 days I have been exfoliating with a lemongrass cleanser in the mornings. I apply rosewater for the day. And at night, I massage the rose hip oil into my face and neck. After two days, my skin looked so much better and richer. There was finally a pregnancy glow I&#x27;ve been looking for! My skin grew soft and supple, the “canyons” are smoothing out more and more. I&#x27;ve had no reaction at all, not even a faint tingle which is awesome! I do not have an aversion to the smell, either. It reminds me of the nut and seed oils you can use in oil paints-- not fishy at all! My morning sickness has been so violent that the blood vessels in my face and eyes have been perpetually broken. I&#x27;ve had one episode since using the rose hip oil and I can&#x27;t believe it, only a fraction of the blood vessels in my face burst this time. I wonder if the nutrients and vitamins in the oils somehow supported my skin and veins against the stress of my morning sickness? I can&#x27;t believe how great my skin looks with just four days of use. I&#x27;ve been rubbing the excess into my hands and they look younger and more supple too. This pregnancy has taken so much out of me but now I look wonderful and I feel so much more confident. I&#x27;m so thrilled with the results that I plan on purchasing a bottle just for my dry scalp! Thank you so much for your amazing product.</li>
