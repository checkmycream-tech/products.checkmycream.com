      <li>Gave them a star because had no other option, but it deserves zero stars.  </li>

<li> Style #1 is more dramatic but I like that look myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> because it is very thin, it just isn&#x27;t what I am used to. :)</li>
<li> I have been buying this for a while the product take a while to be delivered too long to be delivered.  </li>
<li> I really like the thick long ones, the thinner ones are okayyy.</li>
<li> Took a while to get here, but they work as expected.  </li>
<li> They are obviously not real hair</li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll let friends use them when they ask me to do their makeup or extreme emergencies</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only worn the thick ones for a show I was in.</li>
<li> the band is a little difficult to manipulate for beginners because it isn&#x27;t as flexible, but once you get used to it, it looks quite realistic.</li>
<li> They don&#x27;t stay on well after a few hours because they want to straighten out after a while.</li>
<li> They feel heavy while on the eyelids.</li>
<li> The lashes are a bit hard to apply, but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
<li> But I mean I guess because of the price</li>
<li> So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these lashes if your not experienced putting on lashes already.</li>
<li> Not good...looks fake</li>
<li> a thin string.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not necessarily a bad thing, some may even like that</li>
<li> it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
<li> but they aren&#x27;t terrible for the price.</li>
<li> These lashes are the worst they don&#x27;t bend and the hair seem</li>

    <li> They&#x27;re sooo plastic. I don&#x27;t really like them. But I mean I guess because of the price it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
    <li> I enjoy these lashes very much as someone who is experienced with false lashes. the band is a little difficult to manipulate for beginners because it isn&#x27;t as flexible, but once you get used to it, it looks quite realistic. It&#x27;s great for the price.</li>
    <li> Awesome would reorder. If needed</li>
    <li> not the greatest quality but for that price I will make it work! fast shipping!</li>
    <li> They are amazing lashes! Absolutely in love with them! I love style 2, it&#x27;s so dramatic and perfect! Style 1 is really good if you want a more natural look. No complaints about them at all</li>
    <li> Good product, I need to cut it, to use it, as my eyes are smaller, but it&#x27;s ok, easy to use.</li>
    <li> Gave them a star because had no other option, but it deserves zero stars.  I do not recommend this item, unless you&#x27;ll use with dolls, not with human beings.</li>
    <li> These lashes are the worst they don&#x27;t bend and the hair seem like it&#x27;s synthetic do not recommend these! I just use them to practice</li>
    <li> Not good...looks fake</li>
    <li> Easy to put on looks real</li>
    <li> love them cheap and work great will order again</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t write a negative review because the price is Amazing for this many lashes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just know before purchasing that the strip that goes on your lashes is actually a thin string.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not necessarily a bad thing, some may even like that because it is very thin, it just isn&#x27;t what I am used to. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But again, the price is awesome and they are definitely usable, just may take a few sets to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;(Tip: ..use tweezers and not your fingers to apply.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Style #2 is very natural when on, blends well with your natural lashes. Style #1 is more dramatic but I like that look myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrived waaaay faster than anticipated! I was so happy with that aspect too! I will definitely purchase from this seller again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason the item is not 5 stars is because the quality isn&#x27;t the best Ive had...but for the price, definitely worth the buy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seller themself (Chopmall) would definitely get 5 stars from me, though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these lashes if your not experienced putting on lashes already. These lashes are cheap but worth tha price, if you know what your doing you can definitely make them work in your favor. I really like the thick long ones, the thinner ones are okayyy.</li>
    <li> They are obviously not real hair but they aren&#x27;t terrible for the price. I won&#x27;t repurchase though. They aren&#x27;t shaped for an eyelid. They are straight. They can be bent into a usable shape however. They feel heavy while on the eyelids. They don&#x27;t stay on well after a few hours because they want to straighten out after a while. I&#x27;ll let friends use them when they ask me to do their makeup or extreme emergencies but I&#x27;ll stick with my iEnvy by Kiss lashes for now.</li>
    <li> Product came on time and was exactly as pictured, I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> The lashes are a bit hard to apply, but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this for a while the product take a while to be delivered too long to be delivered.  Other than that it&#x27;s perfect love it love it</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed these lashes. The thinner ones are light and fluffy, and the thicker ones are so full!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really like them they feel to plastic for me ... I rather get lashes that are made with human hair ...</li>
    <li> Took a while to get here, but they work as expected.  I&#x27;ve only worn the thick ones for a show I was in.</li>
