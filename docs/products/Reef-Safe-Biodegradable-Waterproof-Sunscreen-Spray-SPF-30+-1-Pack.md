      <li>Great product, great sunblocking.</li>
      <li>lol.</li>

      <li>I was very satisfied with this product &amp; used it for 7 days while scuba diving.</li>
      <li>This reef safe spray on sunscreen feels great on, smells good and is so easy to apply!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This was easy to apply and gave great protection for hrs in the water.</li>
      <li>This is a nice smelling, lightweight sunscreen I recommend.</li>
      <li>Nice coconut smell, no greasy film, no sunburn.</li>
      <li>Just wipe it across the skin to be sure you&#x27;ve got everything covered, and you&#x27;re good.</li>
      <li>great product  and earth friendly.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen spray was very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and liked that we weren&#x27;t hurting the ocean enviroment.</li>
      <li>Hope its really as safe as they say it is for our oceans.</li>
      <li>Needed a reef safe sunblock for an upcoming vacation.</li>
      <li>Still has some chemicals in it that may not be safe for the ocean.</li>
      <li>Just be sure you have a buddy to help you put it on</li>
      <li>I wish that the SPF were greater.</li>
      <li>The spray is a pump spray so it doesn&#x27;t work like aerosol cans, but it&#x27;s worthwhile because it&#x27;s biodegradable.</li>
      <li>I love spray sunscreen because it is so easy.</li>
      <li>It comes out in a fine mist</li>
      <li>It was light and not greasy feeling at all.</li>
      <li>Will definitely buy more!</li>
      <li>that do make him more sensitive to the sun.</li>
      <li>Bought product for recent snorkeling trip to Mexico where needed reef safe sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>As an added bonus, chemicals safe for a coral reef likely have a lower probability of giving me cancer too!</li>
      <li>The spray would be good for children too, without the messy, slippery creams.</li>
      <li>Even still, I spent all day at Xcaret in Cancun, an ecological park, using this sunscreen, and I did fine.</li>
      <li>Would have been nice to have in description like other products have.</li>
      <li>It dried clear and not too greasy, so I was happy about that.</li>
      <li>and I rub it only enough to make sure I get full  coverage.  </li>
      <li>Too much for shipping though.</li>
      <li>I had to get my boyfriend to help spray it on nearly my whole body.</li>
      <li>Another family I was traveling with had some biodegradable sunscreen that was very chalky</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little pricier than normal sunblock, but we have to be kind to the sea life.</li>
      <li>The main reason I purchased it is that it is biodegradable and our vacation destination required this to use at the beach and in the pools.</li>
      <li>Well, he&#x27;s older now and on medications  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if appling more often would help or not.</li>
      <li>Would have possibly ordered this product but could not find clear description of how much product is included.  </li>
      <li>My skin is super-light, so I&#x27;m well aware of the necessity to apply and reapply all day long.</li>
      <li>to the reviews of other biodegradable sunscreens, this worked better than I expected.</li>
      <li>I spent the whole day on the water, snorkeling and in a boat.</li>
      <li>It is better for the environment and worked as well as the other types of sunscreen that I have used in the past.</li>
      <li>I usually use an aerosol which is so easy; you can flip it upside down and everything.&lt;br /&gt;Compared</li>

<li> Thank you for dry spray AND biodegradable.  </li>
<li> I bought this for a macho husband who &amp;#34;never burns&amp;#34; and never wants to wear sunscreen.</li>
<li> You spray it on and there is really no need to \\&quot;rub in\\&quot;.</li>
<li> In the past I have bought biodegradables and they rub on cakey and turns white on your skin.</li>
<li> You do need to re-apply about every hour and a half.</li>
<li> My nose got a little burnt but nothing else...&amp; that was probably my fault</li>
<li> or you might get pretty frustrated trying to spray it on.</li>
<li> I can tell it is weaker than my usual sunscreens based on time in sun and burn damage.</li>
<li> However with this bottle, It became slippery and hard to press once you applied some.</li>
<li> Hard to find!</li>
<li> I was so disappointed with this sunscreen.</li>
<li> And yet I came home with the worst sunburn I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great product, great sunblocking. Still has some chemicals in it that may not be safe for the ocean. But works great for me.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT sunscreen.  We used it daily on our cruise of French Polynesia with out ANY burning!  Will definitely buy more!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and liked that we weren&#x27;t hurting the ocean enviroment.</li>
    <li> perfect for vacation, used in Hawaii while snorkeling.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews on biodegradable sunscreen, and a lot of complaints were about it flaking and drying white. This product did neither. You spray it on and there is really no need to \\&quot;rub in\\&quot;. Just wipe it across the skin to be sure you&#x27;ve got everything covered, and you&#x27;re good. It dried clear and not too greasy, so I was happy about that. I have 2 complaints though:&lt;br /&gt;1) I wish that the SPF were greater. I can tell it is weaker than my usual sunscreens based on time in sun and burn damage. I&#x27;m not sure if appling more often would help or not. Even still, I spent all day at Xcaret in Cancun, an ecological park, using this sunscreen, and I did fine. They also have a lot of shade though. I went snokeling (Basically going out swimming then back to the boat with some shade and back and forth from 9-12) but only applied before I arrived and then sometime in the middle, and I got burned.&lt;br /&gt;2) I love spray sunscreen because it is so easy. Usually you can cover your whole body without help. However with this bottle, It became slippery and hard to press once you applied some. I had to get my boyfriend to help spray it on nearly my whole body. I usually use an aerosol which is so easy; you can flip it upside down and everything.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the reviews of other biodegradable sunscreens, this worked better than I expected. Just be sure you have a buddy to help you put it on or you might get pretty frustrated trying to spray it on. OR maybe you could use it as an excuse to start a conversation with someone lol.</li>
    <li> This is the only way to go if you are planning on getting a biodegradable sunscreen! In the past I have bought biodegradables and they rub on cakey and turns white on your skin. This reef safe spray on sunscreen feels great on, smells good and is so easy to apply! Love it!</li>
    <li> Needed a reef safe sunblock for an upcoming vacation. It&#x27;s a little pricier than normal sunblock, but we have to be kind to the sea life. As an added bonus, chemicals safe for a coral reef likely have a lower probability of giving me cancer too!</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with this product &amp; used it for 7 days while scuba diving. My nose got a little burnt but nothing else...&amp; that was probably my fault</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed with this sunscreen. I spent the whole day on the water, snorkeling and in a boat. My skin is super-light, so I&#x27;m well aware of the necessity to apply and reapply all day long. And I&#x27;m almost fanatical about looking for shade wherever I can find it. I wore a hat whenever I wasn&#x27;t in the water, and re-applied often. And yet I came home with the worst sunburn I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> great product  and earth friendly. The spray is a pump spray so it doesn&#x27;t work like aerosol cans, but it&#x27;s worthwhile because it&#x27;s biodegradable.</li>
    <li> Bought product for recent snorkeling trip to Mexico where needed reef safe sunscreen.  This was easy to apply and gave great protection for hrs in the water. Non greasy. However after 4 days of usage, caused non-itchy rash, skin eruptions which did not resolve until we got home.  It is difficult to find biodegradable reef safe sunscreen, so I would recommend product, but with limited use to avoid reactions.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product for everyone.  It is better for the environment and worked as well as the other types of sunscreen that I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a macho husband who &amp;#34;never burns&amp;#34; and never wants to wear sunscreen. Well, he&#x27;s older now and on medications  that do make him more sensitive to the sun. This protected him and the ocean creatures he was swimming with. The spray would be good for children too, without the messy, slippery creams.</li>
    <li> Works great,doesn&#x27;t stain shirt collars! Too much for shipping though. Hope its really as safe as they say it is for our oceans.</li>
    <li> This is a nice smelling, lightweight sunscreen I recommend. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, but does make you very shiny which some people might like. It stays on well and doesn&#x27;t turn you white.</li>
    <li> Another family I was traveling with had some biodegradable sunscreen that was very chalky this was not and did it&#x27;s job and didn&#x27;t harm the environment. I&#x27;ve worn sunscreen that will take the paint off of things I can&#x27;t imagine what it&#x27;s doing to our body.</li>
    <li> Contrary to some comments about applying this type of sunscreen, I had no problem.  It comes out in a fine mist and I rub it only enough to make sure I get full  coverage.  I even managed to cover my back (though I probably did miss a spot or 2, but I did not burn!!).</li>
    <li> Tested it during a vacation in sunny Mexico. Nice coconut smell, no greasy film, no sunburn. Perfect!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen spray was very easy to apply. It was light and not greasy feeling at all. You do need to re-apply about every hour and a half. The main reason I purchased it is that it is biodegradable and our vacation destination required this to use at the beach and in the pools.</li>
    <li> Thank you for dry spray AND biodegradable.  Hard to find!</li>
    <li> Would have possibly ordered this product but could not find clear description of how much product is included.  2.5oz., 5.5 oz., etc?  Tried to increase photo but it was too blurred.  Would have been nice to have in description like other products have.</li>
