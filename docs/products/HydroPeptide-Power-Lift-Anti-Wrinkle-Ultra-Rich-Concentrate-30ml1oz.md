      <li>Despite my love of the product, I will never use it again and will tell everyone i know to do the same.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Sometimes we assume because it&#x27;s expensive, it&#x27;s the best.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer makes my skin silky smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take very much and does seem to be very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I have ordered this in the past and loved this product.</li>
      <li>and I really don&#x27;t have wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>My skin felt much firmer and toned.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell much difference.</li>
      <li>Always looking for reasonable alternative to the high end eye crèmes.  </li>
      <li>leaves skin feeling moist and soft, Peptide products really make a difference on my face</li>
      <li>So, when she told me about the new product line she was using at her spa, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this product during a facial.</li>
      <li>but generally I don&#x27;t break out from it too much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m finishing up the first jar and I will likely purchase another.</li>
      <li>I first came across Hydropeptide Powerlifting after having a facial at my health cub spa.</li>
      <li>VERY thick but by morning, it is all absorbed and my skin feels  very smooth and not dry.</li>
      <li>I have been getting my facials from her for over 3 years and trust her completely.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely can&#x27;t recommend this stuff in its present form.</li>
      <li>I purchased the products she recommeneded, and while it was more expensive than what I was used to, I knew she had done her homework on the product and felt it was exactly what i needed.  </li>
      <li>So i guess the small spa owner isn&#x27;t important enought for this company.  </li>
      <li>My skin was dry and in much need of hydration.</li>
      <li>His moisturizer really helps with aging dry skin.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing for my dry skin!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend if your skin is dry, or even if it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>Not dry at all</li>
      <li>Purchasing it on Amazon was super easy and much less expensive than at my spa...</li>

<li> Purchasing it on Amazon was super easy and much less expensive than at my spa...</li>
<li> Definitely recommend it for those with dry skin.</li>
<li> Perhaps it&#x27;s worth trying some highly rated less expensive creams.  </li>
<li> My must have for dry winter skin</li>
<li> Had this used on my face during a facial and it was as if all the moisture that I&#x27;d been missing, came back.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It is a pricey product but a little goes a long way and it will last you about 2.5 months to 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
<li> I love this product use twice a day the only reason I gave lower rating is it is too expensive!!</li>
<li> I use it AM and PM and don&#x27;t ever have tight or dry feeling skin.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s pricey, but only use a small amount.  </li>
<li> and I use it with all my other skin care products.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sacrificing other things to buy this.  </li>
<li> I have used their power serum and other lift cream, but this one is scrumptious!  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m so sad that I have to find a new moisturizer.</li>
<li> overuse this product, start out with a small amount and then go from there.</li>
<li> but you just need a small amount to cover your face.</li>
<li> usually put it on in the AM and then apply mineral powder after putting on sunscreen.&lt;br</li>
<li> However, the cream did not make a difference with the two problem areas on my face, at least not yet.  </li>
<li> She was shocked, upset and completely embarassed.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It is expensive but you should use a little bit which is plenty .</li>
<li> it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hoped I had somehow received a bad batch, but a friend of mine just called to tell me that she had the same experience.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have ordered this in the past and loved this product. Unfortunately, the formula seems to have changed. In the past it had a lovely texture, went on smoothly and hydrated my skin, leaving it feeling wonderful. Now, it is thick and slightly sticky and unpleasant to deal with. It works in that it is a moisturizer, but it&#x27;s not the fabulous moisturizer it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hoped I had somehow received a bad batch, but a friend of mine just called to tell me that she had the same experience. I&#x27;m so sad that I have to find a new moisturizer. I absolutely can&#x27;t recommend this stuff in its present form.</li>
    <li> Loves how it feels on my skin! VERY thick but by morning, it is all absorbed and my skin feels  very smooth and not dry.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer!</li>
    <li> My must have for dry winter skin</li>
    <li> Perfect before bedtime and is an awesome antiwrinkle product</li>
    <li> Not a miracle which is what I need</li>
    <li> I have only been using the cream for about three weeks.  I like the way it feels on my skin.  However, the cream did not make a difference with the two problem areas on my face, at least not yet.  I would say for the money, I was expecting that it should make some noticeable difference in a three week time period.  Perhaps it&#x27;s worth trying some highly rated less expensive creams.  Sometimes we assume because it&#x27;s expensive, it&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> Great item just what I wanted</li>
    <li> Thanks! Everything was ok!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this earlier.  I love how mt skin feels after I use it.  Not dry at all</li>
    <li> Awesome! Love this line!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell a huge difference yet but haven&#x27;t used it all. It doesn&#x27;t take very much and does seem to be very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer makes my skin silky smooth and soft. LOVE IT! I referred this brand to my friend and she also loves it. I am rather high maintenance in the skin care arena and this has become my favorite cream for night.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I love it....</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  I have used their power serum and other lift cream, but this one is scrumptious!  Very moisturizing for my dry skin!</li>
    <li> Great moisturising effect small amount needed</li>
    <li> I discovered this product at a spa at The Crescent Hotel in Eureka Springs.  I use it daily and can see and feel the difference in my overall skin condition.</li>
    <li> Delighted with this product</li>
    <li> Had this used on my face during a facial and it was as if all the moisture that I&#x27;d been missing, came back.  It&#x27;s expensive but oh-so-worth it.  My skin drank it up and looked supple and well nourished after I used this.  Highly recommend if your skin is dry, or even if it isn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m sacrificing other things to buy this.  Well worth it!</li>
    <li> Excellent cream, for both day &amp; night. Goods delivered on time</li>
    <li> I bought this as the sample was excellent. I don&#x27;t know if its true that they make the samples more powerful than the full size but it almost seemed like it with this product.</li>
    <li> Creamy and feels so great on the skin. Would buy this product again. The price is fantastic!! Price is so much better here than at a dermatologist</li>
    <li> I use this product regularly and would recommend to everyone.  It is great for my skin and I use it with all my other skin care products. Nice feeling on my skin.</li>
    <li> Pleasant, natural fragrance, nice texture, skin feels/looks smoother.  I&#x27;m finishing up the first jar and I will likely purchase another.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell much difference.</li>
    <li> This product is great on your face and neck.  I use it AM and PM and don&#x27;t ever have tight or dry feeling skin.  It is not greasy at all and keeps working for 12+ hours a day.&lt;br /&gt;I usually put it on in the AM and then apply mineral powder after putting on sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;It is a pricey product but a little goes a long way and it will last you about 2.5 months to 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t overuse this product, start out with a small amount and then go from there.</li>
    <li> I love how it feels in the morning after wearing it to bed. It does have some pore clogging products in the mix but generally I don&#x27;t break out from it too much. Great product for sensitive dry skin. Best used after hydropeptide&#x27;s toner-which is the best toner ever. I would have given it 5 stars but again with the packaging. Jars are not the best idea for creams. They kind of disgust me and product looses its integrity if you have to open daily . So this product needs a proper pump.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this HydroPeptide Power Lift!  My skin felt much firmer and toned.  When I use it, people comment on how great my skin looks.  I used it during the day, under my makeup.  You can use it as a night cream as well.  It&#x27;s pricey, but only use a small amount.  It&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
    <li> I just started using this.  I apply it after I use Eliz Arden ceramide and I really don&#x27;t have wrinkles.  I have some around my eyes but I like those.  It was the wrinkles on my cheeks that made me crazy but this stuff helped.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product line by my esthitian and have been using it for over six months. I actually had two people on my skin this last weekend and I am 64 years old!&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive but you should use a little bit which is plenty .</li>
    <li> leaves skin feeling moist and soft, Peptide products really make a difference on my face</li>
    <li> I first came across Hydropeptide Powerlifting after having a facial at my health cub spa. My skin was dry and in much need of hydration. His moisturizer really helps with aging dry skin. Purchasing it on Amazon was super easy and much less expensive than at my spa...</li>
    <li> I use this product on  a daily basis and would recommend to anyone of any age.  It is great under mineral based makeup and holds the moisture in.  It does not give a greasy appearence and your skin will love it.  Great communication and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for about a year. It does help deter fine lines. Came in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> There is no doubt this is a great product with proven results.  However, if you are considering going into business with this company, I would think twice!  I recently followed my esthitician to her newly open spa.  I have been getting my facials from her for over 3 years and trust her completely.  So, when she told me about the new product line she was using at her spa, I decided to give it a try.  I purchased the products she recommeneded, and while it was more expensive than what I was used to, I knew she had done her homework on the product and felt it was exactly what i needed.  The results were great as promised.  Everything changed when I went for my next facial - just 3 weeks later.  She explained that the company HYDROPEPTIDE had called to inform her that they would no longer allow her to buy their products????!!!!  She was shocked, upset and completely embarassed.  When I probed as to the reason why.  She said HYDROPEPTIDE told her they could not sell to her because another company (who is larger) decided to use them after she had already started.  So i guess the small spa owner isn&#x27;t important enought for this company.  What a shame that greed came before intregity and morals.  Despite my love of the product, I will never use it again and will tell everyone i know to do the same.  Her new product - Jan Marini is FANTASTIC!  Shame on you HYDROPEPTIDE!</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product during a facial. It is wonderful and really makes your skin glow and look great. It&#x27;s a bit expensive but you just need a small amount to cover your face. I love it and am getting more.</li>
    <li> Helps my skin retain moisture especially through the winter months.</li>
    <li> Always looking for reasonable alternative to the high end eye crèmes.  This product seems to fit the bill at a fairly reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Skin feels great! Use with the serun for better results.</li>
    <li> I love this product use twice a day the only reason I gave lower rating is it is too expensive!!</li>
    <li> Not the same product I get from my esthetician. The creme was thinker glumly and more yellow that the newer stuff. Perhaps its just nearing the expiration date.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer. I have dry skin and use it morning and night with very good results.  Definitely recommend it for those with dry skin.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer EVER!</li>
