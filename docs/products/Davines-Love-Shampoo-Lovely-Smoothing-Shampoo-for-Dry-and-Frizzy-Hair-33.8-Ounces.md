      <li>This is awesome shampoo.</li>
      <li>Especially great for curly hair</li>
      <li>My colorist is one of the best there is (she does hair for Reese Whitherspoon, Heidi Klum, Kate Winslet, Brad Pitt, Sienna Miller, Raquel Welch, the Olson&#x27;s, etc, etc, etc and has written her own book).</li>

      <li>I love this product - it makes my hair feel amazing!  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo!  </li>
      <li>And I really love them!  </li>
      <li>Love this Shampoo!</li>
      <li>This formula smells amazing</li>
      <li>Whenever I have house guests they always comment on how amazing the shampoo is.</li>
      <li>tried the Davines Love shampoo and conditioner because I&#x27;ve tried so many Davines products to date and loved them.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best smelling shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo works wonders on my daughters fine knotty hair too!</li>
      <li>So for him it worked fine even though his hair doesn&#x27;t at all fit what this shampoo is supposed to be good for.</li>
      <li>Huge fan!</li>
      <li>Ordering this size makes it so much more affordable.  </li>
      <li>After the praising reviews here I thought I&#x27;d give the Love Shampoo a try.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Love this shampoo, ordered with the conditioner.</li>
      <li>So if you have breakdown it may work better for you</li>
      <li>Arrived quiclkly, I am pleased.</li>
      <li>and I love the way it leaves my hair.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I found the shampoo to be good to great, but a bit pricey.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Well pleased with this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>My hair just felt drier and more brittle than ever after use.</li>
      <li>LOVE this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, I used it and immediately it did not seem authentic.</li>
      <li>It smells lovely - a hint of grapefruit.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many things.  </li>
      <li>i am so glad i found this product on amazon, i used to order it from my hair dresser</li>
      <li>It has a nice light scent to boot.  </li>
      <li>My favorite shampoo.</li>
      <li>Now it&#x27;s smooth and silky!</li>
      <li>Gives it more body and swing.  </li>
      <li>That said, I give the advantage to the Oi shampoo and conditioner because I find it to be even more hydrating, which my extra-dry hair needs.  </li>
      <li>I have color-treated, naturally curly and fine hair, so I thought it sounded like a perfect fit for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use it with the Love Smooth conditioner, makes my hair so manageable and doesn&#x27;t blow up in humid weather~</li>
      <li>For hair like mine that can get curly or frizzy in the humidity, Love takes care of it and makes it smooth.  </li>
      <li>if you want healthy hair, go for a sulfate and silicone free shampoo people.</li>
      <li>so more of a value than the original sticker shock indicates.</li>
      <li>Still, I think it is a really great set and much more hydrating than most other shampoos and conditioners I&#x27;ve tried and am giving it five stars for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And then I style with the Deva Curl Styling Cream and Deva Curl light defining gel.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find a pump that will fit it</li>
      <li>NOTHING makes my hair silky smooth and shiny.  </li>
      <li>Real Davines love shampoo does not make a lot of suds unless you apply a couple or more handfuls to your hair.</li>
      <li>I also love the fresh, clean, grapefruit-ey scent.</li>
      <li>Yet it leaves your hair feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
      <li>They are quite moisturizing and using them in conduction with the aforementioned Davines styling products, my hair looked very healthy and smooth and styled easily.  </li>
      <li>One Condition to clean and condition my hair.  </li>
      <li>After shampooing/conditioning with Davine&#x27;s smooth series, pump some Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum to the ends of your damp hair.</li>
      <li>My dry, fly away hair is gone with this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the higher price if healthy hair is important to you.</li>
      <li>I also reviewed the conditioner for this line and had nothing but good things to say - the same holds true for the shampoo.</li>
      <li>great results on my formerly fine &amp; frizzy mess, see my review for the conditioner as well.</li>
      <li>Recently, I also went to a great hair stylist and she taught me a trick which I am much obliged to share with you all.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t even need to use much shampoo to get good suds action (and I have a LOT of hair).  </li>
      <li>this is a great product really dramatically reduced frizziness and corrected actually singed hair.  </li>
      <li>It really does a good job of cleaning my naturally curly hair.  </li>
      <li>Not only do they make your hair look and feel amazing</li>
      <li>It is a bit pricy, but well worth the expense in my opinion.</li>
      <li>and it is well worth the price.</li>
      <li>I hesitated to buy this shampoo because of the hefty price tag, but, having used it for 6 months I have two words: Worth.</li>
      <li>otherwise the product seems fine, but it was certainly over-hyped int he article I read that caused me to buy it in the first place.</li>
      <li>For awhile I wasn&#x27;t convinced salon brands were really worth the money until I found the exact products that worked for me, cut back on how often I washed and heat styled my hair, and had my hair cut more often.  </li>
      <li>the smell is pretty strong and she told me she was using all natural products.</li>
      <li>Have used it for the last 6 months, does not strip color and hair feels softer and has more shine.</li>
      <li>This is my first review on Amazon.</li>
      <li>The only thing that would have been nice to receive with this purchase is a pump for the top, it&#x27;s such a big bottle</li>
      <li>On the days I wear my hair straight, I shampoo &amp; condition with either Kevin Murphy&#x27;s Blonde Angel products (to help my hair from becoming too brassy) or Davines Oi products.  </li>
      <li>I now have the large size bottles of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>It also has a slight grapefruit-like smell that smelled really fresh and appealing.  </li>
      <li>Disappointed, I gave the rest of the shampoo bottle to my fiance, who has thicker, more oily hair -- and he loved it!</li>
      <li>and I figured I was spending about $12 every month on department store products that didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
      <li>I was using Kerastase, which is a great product, but not great on the budget.</li>
      <li>After the &#x27;poo + conditioning alone, I noticed that my frizz has subsided by much.</li>
      <li>This product does not lather much,  </li>
      <li>so I suggest buying a cheap soap pump or a smaller bottle for ease of use.</li>
      <li>I actually really like my hair now</li>
      <li>Davines products are often recommended for color treated hair because they are gentle.</li>
      <li>Real Davines Love shampoo makes your hair feel lush and smooth--with just a tiny bit.</li>
      <li>and this is the first product that i have used with no other product other than the shampoo and conditioner with such great results.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best shampoo ever used.</li>
    <li> great results on my formerly fine &amp; frizzy mess, see my review for the conditioner as well. If you were only to have pockets deep enough for one or the other, the conditioner is the more miraculous of the pair, but I am a fan of the shampoo as well. smells great, de-frizzes &amp; perks up the curls, Bought both on Amazon but it was way cheaper a while back....</li>
    <li> I have medium-curly hair, which usually just results in a giant wavy-frizz-mess.  But this shampoo is amazing!  I actually really like my hair now (I never like my hair!), and it keeps it soft, it allows it to hang in a non-pyramid style around my head, but does not add any weight or oilyness.  You don&#x27;t even need to use much shampoo to get good suds action (and I have a LOT of hair).  This bottle will last for ages, so it really isn&#x27;t *quite* as expensive as it seems.</li>
    <li> Davines products are often recommended for color treated hair because they are gentle. The line is also more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; compared to other hair products. Overall, I found the shampoo to be good to great, but a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> I was using Kerastase, which is a great product, but not great on the budget. My colorist is one of the best there is (she does hair for Reese Whitherspoon, Heidi Klum, Kate Winslet, Brad Pitt, Sienna Miller, Raquel Welch, the Olson&#x27;s, etc, etc, etc and has written her own book). She recommended this product for me as an alternative. It works very well smoothing the hair, but not weighing it down and leaves it shinny. It&#x27;s also easier on the budget. I like to buy the professional size as I have to buy it less often and save $. The conditioner is also great; a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is my first review on Amazon. That being said I am usually a pretty lazy person and do not review products as much as I should. But this shampoo is so awesome that I had to share my thoughts to ease the woes of my fellow frizzy/wavy hair comrades.    I have yet to find a shampoo + conditioner combo that has helped my frizzy hair. I am also one of the very few asians that have wavy hair. After the &#x27;poo + conditioning alone, I noticed that my frizz has subsided by much. Yipee!     Recently, I also went to a great hair stylist and she taught me a trick which I am much obliged to share with you all. After shampooing/conditioning with Davine&#x27;s smooth series, pump some Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum to the ends of your damp hair. Blow dry/air dry at your pleasure. And feel the smoothness and manageable hair! No more tangles, knots, unruly hair.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best smelling shampoo I have ever used.  My previous hair stylist used it on me and the fragrance would always stay with me for days after my visit to her.  Since I moved several states away and my new stylist uses a different shampoo, I picked up this shampoo for my house.  The shampoo is thick and you don&#x27;t need much.  This shampoo has a 12 month shelf-life and comes in quite a big bottle, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you don&#x27;t shampoo often or don&#x27;t have a lot of hair becasue it could potentially expire before you use it up. It holds up well for my thick, curly, frizzy hair and is quite easy on my color-treated hair as well.  It&#x27;s pricey for a shampoo, but if you love a unique, fresh-scented shampoo, and you have difficult hair, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This Love shampoo is the best.  For hair like mine that can get curly or frizzy in the humidity, Love takes care of it and makes it smooth.  Great!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is wonderful. I have very dry and coarse hair. This shampoo has worked miracles on my hair. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I hesitated to buy this shampoo because of the hefty price tag, but, having used it for 6 months I have two words: Worth. It. Literally the best shampoo ever. And this size has lasted me several months so more of a value than the original sticker shock indicates. Whenever I have house guests they always comment on how amazing the shampoo is. The bottle is inconvenient (its large and not conducive to pouring small amounts) so I suggest buying a cheap soap pump or a smaller bottle for ease of use.</li>
    <li> The only thing that would have been nice to receive with this purchase is a pump for the top, it&#x27;s such a big bottle I can&#x27;t find a pump that will fit it so I end up dumping half of it down the drain every time I use it.</li>
    <li> This is awesome shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great value for this amazing product. I have very long thick wavy hair and this helps me to straighten it with its smoothing and protecting ingredients. It smells lovely - a hint of grapefruit.  Huge fan!</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes coarse and thick hair seem  like it is soft and smooth.  It has a nice light scent to boot.  I have used this shampoo for years and it is the best.</li>
    <li> this is a great product really dramatically reduced frizziness and corrected actually singed hair.  Gives it more body and swing.  I have very thin and fine hair and this is the first product that i have used with no other product other than the shampoo and conditioner with such great results.</li>
    <li> Very thick, my hair does not work with thick conditioners it gets oily. So if you have breakdown it may work better for you</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo, ordered with the conditioner. I was paying double buying the smaller package and found the larger size at Amazon. I literally saved 50% of the cost by ordering the larger package from Amazon....</li>
    <li> I saw a few of the reviews that this product via amazon might not be authentic but I decided to give it a try because it has been a hassle to order it and get it shipped through a salon I trust. Anyway, I used it and immediately it did not seem authentic. Real Davines love shampoo does not make a lot of suds unless you apply a couple or more handfuls to your hair. With just one quarter size handful it was sudsing like crazy and when I rinsed it, my hair felt stiff like I had washed it with dishsoap or something really harsh! I thought maybe I&#x27;m imaging things so I added another quarter size of it to my hair and again my hair felt stiff and knotted. I tried to run my fingers through my hair but it was all tangled up! Ahhh! Real Davines Love shampoo makes your hair feel lush and smooth--with just a tiny bit. The stuff that I got through amazon was pink and smelled the same but seemed watered down or perhaps an entirely different thing pretending to be Davines Love. Maybe it was just this one bottle--I don&#x27;t know but I am sending back to day and am going to go back to the salon for the real stuff. Bummer!</li>
    <li> I went to a salon yesterday and the hairdresser put this on me. the smell is pretty strong and she told me she was using all natural products. she tried to sell me a bottle afterwards. i looked at the ingredients. sulfates, silicones, panthenol, alcohol... all very drying and thick coating (bad) ingredients. no way this stuff is going on my hair again. it has drug store shampoo ingredients, it shouldn&#x27;t be so expensive either. just suave in a fancy bottle. if you want healthy hair, go for a sulfate and silicone free shampoo people. if it says sulfate in the ingredients, stay away</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Davines conditioners and always in search of a shampoo that will work well on my hair. After the praising reviews here I thought I&#x27;d give the Love Shampoo a try. I have color-treated, naturally curly and fine hair, so I thought it sounded like a perfect fit for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I was disappointed with the results. My hair just felt drier and more brittle than ever after use. Disappointed, I gave the rest of the shampoo bottle to my fiance, who has thicker, more oily hair -- and he loved it! So for him it worked fine even though his hair doesn&#x27;t at all fit what this shampoo is supposed to be good for. Oh well, at least we&#x27;re not wasting a very expensive bottle!</li>
    <li> I love this product - it makes my hair feel amazing!  Especially great for curly hair - makes unruly hair look soft and curly!</li>
    <li> It shows pink but when it came it was the purple. May I return it?</li>
    <li> my daughter loves this shampoo.!</li>
    <li> I have very curly, coarse hair which also tends to get very frizzy - especially in humid climates.  These products really tame it down quite a bit.  I have tried many things.  I still have to put a \\&quot;leave in\\&quot; product on my hair at all times for further taming, but I really like both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love this product. A friend gave me some samples and I was hooked. I now have the large size bottles of shampoo and conditioner. I have corse, thick, frizzy, wavy, very long hair that I straighten it every other day. This stuff has actually seemed to improve my hair. On the weekends I can now go with a wash and air dry and it isn&#x27;t frizzy and the waves look healthier and smoother. It is a bit pricy, but well worth the expense in my opinion. The larger bottles will last a while and I figured I was spending about $12 every month on department store products that didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product, my hair stylist has been using this product for a long time and it is the only shampoo that can tame my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I received a really awesome deal on this product and quick shipping</li>
    <li> Great smoothing shampoo- the only shampoo that my super- thick, dryness prone hair loves!  Now it&#x27;s smooth and silky!</li>
    <li> Well pleased with this shampoo.  Have used it for the last 6 months, does not strip color and hair feels softer and has more shine.</li>
    <li> For context, I have thick, shoulder length hair.  It is highlighted blonde, somewhat coarse, and naturally wavy.  For me, my biggest hair issue is keeping it soft and shiny, especially since I regularly heat style and highlight my hair.  Over the years I&#x27;ve tried all manners of shampoo from affordable drug store brands to a variety of salon brands.  For awhile I wasn&#x27;t convinced salon brands were really worth the money until I found the exact products that worked for me, cut back on how often I washed and heat styled my hair, and had my hair cut more often.  I say that because based on my experience, no one thing is a miracle cure and it wasn&#x27;t until I did all these things that I&#x27;ve had the softest, healthiest hair I&#x27;ve ever had in my entire life.  That doesn&#x27;t mean it is flawless or that I don&#x27;t have bad hair days (I do!), it just is noticeably healthier than it&#x27;s ever been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my general regime. On the days I wear my hair straight, I shampoo &amp; condition with either Kevin Murphy&#x27;s Blonde Angel products (to help my hair from becoming too brassy) or Davines Oi products.  Then I style with a combination of Davines This is a Relaxing Moisturizing Fluid and OI/Absolute Beautifying Potion while using my hair dryer and flat iron.  On the days I wear my hair curly, I use Deva Curl No Poo and Deva Curl One Condition to clean and condition my hair.  And then I style with the Deva Curl Styling Cream and Deva Curl light defining gel.  Yes, it&#x27;s a lot of products but it&#x27;s what works well for me and many of them I use so little of (especially the styling products) that they last me a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Davines Love shampoo and conditioner because I&#x27;ve tried so many Davines products to date and loved them.  I was curious to see how these would compare to the others I&#x27;ve tried.  And I really love them!  They are quite moisturizing and using them in conduction with the aforementioned Davines styling products, my hair looked very healthy and smooth and styled easily.  It also has a slight grapefruit-like smell that smelled really fresh and appealing.  That said, I give the advantage to the Oi shampoo and conditioner because I find it to be even more hydrating, which my extra-dry hair needs.  However, if your hair is less prone to dryness and less problematic than mine, you might fine this to be sufficient.  Still, I think it is a really great set and much more hydrating than most other shampoos and conditioners I&#x27;ve tried and am giving it five stars for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately though, I think it comes down to what your individual needs.  Everyone&#x27;s hair is a little bit different and we all have different preferences when it comes to styling so for me there was no substitute for experimenting and figuring out what worked with my unique hair needs.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, this is one of my favorite Davines formulas.  Ordering this size makes it so much more affordable.  This formula smells amazing and I love the way it leaves my hair.  I recommend getting a smaller bottle and using and refilling that in the shower.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It really does a good job of cleaning my naturally curly hair.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone over Kerastase.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo. Delightful fragrance and nourishes my hair. I&#x27;ve tried other shampoos, but always go back to Davines.</li>
    <li> Love this Shampoo! Leaves your hair smelling great!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  Smells awesome.</li>
    <li> I also reviewed the conditioner for this line and had nothing but good things to say - the same holds true for the shampoo. This shampoo and its conditioner are a perfect pair. If you want finer, smoother hair; if you want to actually change the TEXTURE of your hair, you will NOT be disappointed. This shampoo is a bit pricey but it will last you over a year, and is for someone who really wants to nourish and change their hair. I also love the fresh, clean, grapefruit-ey scent.</li>
    <li> NOTHING makes my hair silky smooth and shiny.  I have coarser hair and always wanted silky hair-- I tried everything and then I went to a fundraiser and this shampoo, conditioner and oil was in my bag.  I tried it and immediately ordered a bunch of it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I use it with the Love Smooth conditioner, makes my hair so manageable and doesn&#x27;t blow up in humid weather~</li>
    <li> My wife loves this for its treatment of friz especially. I&#x27;ve used it as well and it is well worth the price. Highly recommended (though it is expensive.)</li>
    <li> My dry, fly away hair is gone with this shampoo.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for a year now.  It will take a lot to get me to change hair products now.  My hair has never felt so soft and silky, and it has never looked so shiny.  It&#x27;s a MUST to use this shampoo with the conditioner, too.  Not only do they make your hair look and feel amazing, they smell amazing, too!  Definitely worth the higher price if healthy hair is important to you.</li>
    <li> I color my hair often and damage it on a daily basis yet it is long, thick and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other shampoos and I keep coming back because this actually works!</li>
    <li> Not authentic!  I suspected it was fake, so I went to the salon and bought the real deal to compare.  Definitely not real davines!</li>
    <li> odd that they would deliver such a large bottle without a pump.  otherwise the product seems fine, but it was certainly over-hyped int he article I read that caused me to buy it in the first place.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is so watery that I have to use 3 pumps just to get enough shampoo to get my hair clean which is twice as much as I would use with the product that used previously.  This might be the worst shampoo that I have ever used when you factor in the cost.</li>
    <li> hairdresser introduced this product too me.. its now the only shampoo i  use.. removes all the build up from conditioners i use.</li>
    <li> This is the main shampoo of the line&lt;br /&gt;I alternate off with using this 3 times a week&lt;br /&gt;And trying the other ones for curl or shine</li>
    <li> This shampoos really tamed my hair and made it soft.</li>
    <li> i am so glad i found this product on amazon, i used to order it from my hair dresser but she switched brands. i am half puerto rican and italian with very thick curly hair that i color treat... i have used other salon brands and this is my favorite.  i order the large bottle and it last up to 6 months, i was my hair about 2x per week.</li>
    <li> This product does not lather much,  Yet it leaves your hair feeling clean and smooth.  Wonderful shampoo.  Arrived quiclkly, I am pleased.</li>
    <li> LOVE this shampoo.  I shelved my Moroccan Oil after trying Davines.  This shampoo works wonders on my daughters fine knotty hair too!</li>
