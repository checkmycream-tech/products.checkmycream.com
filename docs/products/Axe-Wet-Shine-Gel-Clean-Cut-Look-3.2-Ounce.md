      <li>Great hold and great look.  </li>
      <li>makes the hair look amazing and smells incredible.</li>

      <li>He loved it.  </li>
      <li>He tried the product and his sister said it made his hair look good.</li>
      <li>When I put the gel min the morning, it looks good.</li>
      <li>It helps keep hair in place and is good for styling</li>
      <li>scent is very light and pleasant, and what I consider unisex.</li>
      <li>as the smell is sort of strong and not altogether attractive</li>
      <li>I love the way it keeps both hubby and my son smelling good</li>
      <li>This is not that kind of gel.</li>
      <li>But the quality of the product is excellent, and I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>This has a pleasant fragrance, light and not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Basically he makes most of his hair stand up in the front in a formation that we lovingly refer to as \\&quot;the unicorn\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>The AXE brand is a more Manly version of their hair care products and I can say that it keeps with tradition well.</li>
      <li>And so this product is A okay with me.  </li>
      <li>suppose many readers will want to know if this product does in fact shine.</li>
      <li>In my house we love Axe.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>but this isn&#x27;t our favorite.</li>
      <li>Great product and whole heartedly recommend.</li>
      <li>I also combed his hair into a more clean cut look as the gel&#x27;s name suggests and this looked nice</li>
      <li>Not sticky holds great soft to the touch.</li>
      <li>This is a much more sound purchase than what I was using for thirteen bucks a bottle.</li>
      <li>Leaves a nice shine, leaving hair looking wet/damp, but still full and clean and not a grease-ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was pleased with the performance of this as I&#x27;ve used a different brand for years and was quite happy with it.</li>
      <li>It just depends on how strong you like your fragrance.</li>
      <li>This is a very good wet gel.  </li>
      <li>Axe makes great products, and this hair gel is no different.</li>
      <li>It does put a shine in my hair and I like the light citrussy scent.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s also far superior.</li>
      <li>But in all seriousness, this is a pretty good Gel by Axe, and he&#x27;s pretty picky when it comes to his &#x27;do.</li>
      <li>This one would be for an every day or a formal look to make sure the hair stays exactly where I want them to be.</li>
      <li>you are looking for a wet look gel that holds well, this may very well be perfect for you.</li>
      <li>After trying almost every hair hold product Axe makes, I&#x27;ve decided that this is one cool company making quality products.</li>
      <li>It works really well and with most Unilever products works well at an affordable price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Using too much can cause a filmy residue and you should avoid applying more than one application to hair.</li>
      <li>The best way I found to make this work on dry hair is to use a generous amount, smooth it from the roots to the ends, wet hands under water, and then add that on top of the hair to bring out the shine and help with styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This works well for me (male, short hair) and also had a nice pleasant a light scent.  </li>
      <li>Washes out very easily with just some warm water and a little of your regular shampoo (might I suggest axe here? :P)</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t feel as fresh and clean in my hair</li>
      <li>Hols up pretty well, easily styles and is overall nice to the hair.</li>
      <li>I gave this to my handsome 16 year old grandson to try.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall good product for as anyone looking to have wet looking hair.</li>
      <li>If you worry about putting chemicals in your hair, I&#x27;d recommend avoiding this product and trying something much more natural instead.</li>
      <li>What more could an old geezer ask for?</li>
      <li>Pleasant but mild scent (typical Axe)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>This product is mostly marketed toward young males.</li>
      <li>We love many of Axe&#x27;s other products, but this one is not one we will buy again.</li>
      <li>It smells like a tropical sunscreen mixed with Sweet Tarts, but not in an overwhelming way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The product works great with wet hair and you really don&#x27;t have to use much of it to reap the benefits.</li>
      <li>I recommend you smell it first before you buy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure several people might already know what that brand was.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does offer a wet look but it also makes the hair very crunchy which isn&#x27;t very appealing.</li>
      <li>It simply reminds me more of a pomade type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 2 stars.</li>
      <li>Wet Shine Gel is pretty gloopey - it is the most like the hair gels I&#x27;ve seen throughout the eighties and nineties.</li>
      <li>I found that my hair possess a certain glow after using this gel that it didn&#x27;t have before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Many other hair products advertise their ability to make one&#x27;s hair shine and many fall flat of this promise.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, if you ignore the overpowering odour from this gel, it is actually a pretty decent styling agent.  </li>
      <li>We preferr a more natural/mild wet.</li>
      <li>product works better on wet hair.</li>
      <li>I like it for this purpose, but it has a smell that I don&#x27;t really like</li>
      <li>not as much as I used to, but still ample.  </li>
      <li>My 9 year old grandson decided to join in the fun, and used some gel to make a unicorn horn.  </li>
      <li>Pushing the big 80, I feel quite fortunate to still have lots of hair...</li>
      <li>This really gives me peace of mind.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need a whole palm full.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>most other gels, it is non-greasy.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply, just be careful not to use too much.  </li>
      <li>makes hair shiny and has a decent hold to it.</li>
      <li>This Axe Wet Shine Gel is great for a few reasons.</li>
      <li>Highly efficient . . .</li>
      <li>high quality gel.</li>
      <li>keep my hair slicked back and gives a nice wet look too.&lt;br /&gt;Great for the spring/summertime!</li>
      <li>can use a little bit (slightly more than the recommended amount of a finger tip)</li>
      <li>Sometimes I enjoy styling my hair with gel to get a wet shiny look.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very clean look without being too cumbersome and heavy.</li>
      <li>It fits very well in a diaper dag or large purse such as the one I carry.</li>
      <li>It smells more masculine and works well with a little amount applied.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re looking for a new styling gel, give this one a try.</li>
      <li>It produces a true wet look with some hold.</li>
      <li>If they could ease up on the scent a little, it would be an easy five stars.</li>
      <li>This 3.2 ounce tube is nice since it&#x27;s small enough to qualify for carry-on.  </li>
      <li>and I get good all day results (even a little half day wetting / restyle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not really my idea of a gel and seems to only be suitable for really short hair, just to sort of give a finished look, without any styling or holding power needed.. like a pomade.</li>
      <li>Axe recently released a whole new line of mousse and gel products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll keep this one around for creating certain hair looks, but it won&#x27;t be my daily go-to product (that would be the \\&quot;Spiking</li>
      <li>It has the more guy like packaging and it certainly wont be confused with your girlfriends or wife&#x27;s hair</li>
      <li>A medium hold clear hair gel.  </li>
      <li>The scent fades away almost completely as the gel dries.</li>
      <li>A real hassle and a necessary consideration</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t work as a styling product nearly as well</li>
      <li>However I&#x27;m an older female that has longer length curly hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a little less enthusiastic about it.</li>
      <li>It too reminiscent of a high school boys&#x27; locker room or the guilt-filled bedroom of a frat kid.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stand the smell of Axe.  It too reminiscent of a high school boys&#x27; locker room or the guilt-filled bedroom of a frat kid.  Blech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you ignore the overpowering odour from this gel, it is actually a pretty decent styling agent.  It holds well, limited flaking &amp; crusting.  It&#x27;s a very clean look without being too cumbersome and heavy.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the performance of this as I&#x27;ve used a different brand for years and was quite happy with it. I&#x27;ve since switched and now use this exclusively. This is a much more sound purchase than what I was using for thirteen bucks a bottle. I&#x27;m sure several people might already know what that brand was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Axe line of products is a solid investment for male grooming. No problems.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that Axe isn&#x27;t putting this on the shelf any longer. it is a great product for my hair.</li>
    <li> Just like every other product from AXE, this is perfection too. makes the hair look amazing and smells incredible. high quality gel.</li>
    <li> Best hair gel ever!! Not sticky holds great soft to the touch. Just wish it was easier to buy</li>
    <li> A medium hold clear hair gel.  There are lots of them out there.  This Axe product among the leaders in the herd due to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Pleasant but mild scent (typical Axe)&lt;br /&gt;- Highly efficient . . . directions say \\&quot;a finger tip amount\\&quot;.  That&#x27;s enough.  You don&#x27;t need a whole palm full.&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves a nice shine, leaving hair looking wet/damp, but still full and clean and not a grease-ball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most other gels, it is non-greasy.  In keeping with the \\&quot;medium-hold\\&quot; label, it is not very overly crunchy (firm, but no hard surface).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, I&#x27;ll add that I&#x27;ve often had problems finding a hair gel product in a dispenser small enough to get past security in my airline carry-on bag (3.5 oz limit).  This 3.2 ounce tube is nice since it&#x27;s small enough to qualify for carry-on.  A real hassle and a necessary consideration these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said - lot&#x27;s of gels out there.  Almost all of them work fine and this AXE Wet Shine Gel gets five stars for a few extra positive features.</li>
    <li> My son didn&#x27;t like this product as all.  It gave the wet look without the hold so all day kids just thought his hair was greasy rather than styled. This gel doesn&#x27;t hold well either; it&#x27;s medium thickness similar to hand sanitizer but it didn&#x27;t work.  Then it started flaking so now he has greasy hair with dandruff.  Skip this product for teenage boys.</li>
    <li> After trying almost every hair hold product Axe makes, I&#x27;ve decided that this is one cool company making quality products. There is an entire menu of hair holding formulations: they have dust, putty, paste, glue, gel, and serum-like textures, with various degrees of hold, shine and crunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wet Shine Gel is pretty gloopey - it is the most like the hair gels I&#x27;ve seen throughout the eighties and nineties. It has quite a bit of hold when you use enough of it, and imparts a high shine to hair - again, when you use enough of it. A small amount doesn&#x27;t have quite the action the other Axe hair products do, where a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works better on wet hair. The best way I found to make this work on dry hair is to use a generous amount, smooth it from the roots to the ends, wet hands under water, and then add that on top of the hair to bring out the shine and help with styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight &#x27;crunchy&#x27; sensation when dry; you can feel there is product in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very light and pleasant, and what I consider unisex. It smells like a tropical sunscreen mixed with Sweet Tarts, but not in an overwhelming way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is that if you like your hair to look slicked back, as in wet (as the product clearly indicates), then this one is certainly a contender. My male friends roundly agree there isn&#x27;t enough hold for them, as compared to the Spiked Look and Messy Look Axe versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep this one around for creating certain hair looks, but it won&#x27;t be my daily go-to product (that would be the \\&quot;Spiking Glue\\&quot;, which strangely enough, feels less gluey).</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my 9th grade son, who uses All Things Axe.  He loved it.  He has short hair and he likes to spike his bangs up.  His review:  \\&quot;Not very sticky so it didn&#x27;t feel prickly or slimy.  It kept it firm for the whole night.  And all the girls thought it smelled good.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My adult observation is that it gives, as advertised, a wet look (as opposed to a stiffer waxy look).  If you don&#x27;t want a wet look, you won&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it on myself for reviewing purposes, but I am not a good subject - I have long hair and long bangs.  I did find that it gave a low-medium hold on longer hair, and it also have a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look on me, which is not what I want at age 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Gives a firm hold and a wet look.  Made for a younger crowd.</li>
    <li> This is standard AXE quality hair gel. It works really well and with most Unilever products works well at an affordable price. The AXE brand is a more Manly version of their hair care products and I can say that it keeps with tradition well. It smells more masculine and works well with a little amount applied. It has the more guy like packaging and it certainly wont be confused with your girlfriends or wife&#x27;s hair stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can use a little bit (slightly more than the recommended amount of a finger tip) and I get good all day results (even a little half day wetting / restyle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to the stuff is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to play well with overnight oils and if you are going to not shower for a day or two it really makes your hair look nasty. So if you are weekending out, use less ...</li>
    <li> But in all seriousness, this is a pretty good Gel by Axe, and he&#x27;s pretty picky when it comes to his &#x27;do. What 14yo isn&#x27;t? He likes it, so I like it, can&#x27;t go wrong with that! Recommended!</li>
    <li> This AXE gel gives you a little wetter look than the messy one, which is more waxy.  Depending on different times, I&#x27;d like to apply different gel for different looks.  This one would be for an every day or a formal look to make sure the hair stays exactly where I want them to be.</li>
    <li> This Axe Wet Shine Gel is great for a few reasons. The product works great with wet hair and you really don&#x27;t have to use much of it to reap the benefits. I also found that I didn&#x27;t have to work as hard to make it look like I hadn&#x27;t been styling my hair as I&#x27;ve had to do with some of the styling gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose many readers will want to know if this product does in fact shine. Many other hair products advertise their ability to make one&#x27;s hair shine and many fall flat of this promise. I found that my hair possess a certain glow after using this gel that it didn&#x27;t have before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a new styling gel, give this one a try. The product is guaranteed to last for awhile and it&#x27;s as quality a gel as I&#x27;ve seen in a long time.</li>
    <li> Axe makes great products, and this hair gel is no different. It has a solid hold and leaves hair with a slightly wet and shiny look. While there is a light amount of crunch when dry, it does not leave you with helmet hard hair. Great product and whole heartedly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B001B2RVXA WEN® Cucumber Aloe Styling Creme 6oz]] and while it&#x27;s much more expensive than this Axe product it&#x27;s also far superior. This did give my hair a wet look but it didn&#x27;t work as a styling product nearly as well and it doesn&#x27;t feel as fresh and clean in my hair either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several Axe products and I&#x27;m not a fan of theirs,</li>
    <li> Excellent for the mom or grandmother on the go with a baby.  I can use this at work, in a restaurant, at home, someone else&#x27;s home , the motel etc. It fits very well in a diaper dag or large purse such as the one I carry. This item makes it possible for my baby to have her bottles washed and I know no one else has used it to do any other bottles but hers. This really gives me peace of mind.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great, works in quickly and doesn&#x27;t get too gunky/gooey and make your hair greasy and disgusting. Hols up pretty well, easily styles and is overall nice to the hair. Washes out very easily with just some warm water and a little of your regular shampoo (might I suggest axe here? :P)</li>
    <li> I gave this to my handsome 16 year old grandson to try.  He tried the product and his sister said it made his hair look good. My 9 year old grandson decided to join in the fun, and used some gel to make a unicorn horn.  The horn held really good even while sleeping. :)  It took a thorough shampooing to get the gel out in the morning before school. The gel has a noticeable scent so be careful not to use other products with a scent at the same time.</li>
    <li> This is some great hair gel from the folks at Axe men products.&lt;br /&gt;It keep my hair slicked back and gives a nice wet look too.&lt;br /&gt;Great for the spring/summertime!</li>
    <li> This gel gives your hair the wet look. makes hair shiny and has a decent hold to it. No flaking or crusting from use.</li>
    <li> This product is mostly marketed toward young males. However I&#x27;m an older female that has longer length curly hair. Sometimes I enjoy styling my hair with gel to get a wet shiny look. I was attracted to this product because it&#x27;s description states that&#x27;s it&#x27;s a wet look gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a gender neutral scent.The scent fades away almost completely as the gel dries. So no worries for ladies not wanting to smell like a teen aged male. At first I was slightly disappointed with the small tube of product. However with use I find that a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance wise this is a very good product. It&#x27;s not sticky or overly stiff. It produces a true wet look with some hold. I noticed no flakes after the gel dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall good product for as anyone looking to have wet looking hair.</li>
    <li> My son is liking this gel to give his hair some shine and to create his signature do.  Basically he makes most of his hair stand up in the front in a formation that we lovingly refer to as \\&quot;the unicorn\\&quot;.  If this gel can provide enough hold for the clumped and stuck up in the air style that my son loves then it will provide enough hold for other less extreme styles as well.  I also combed his hair into a more clean cut look as the gel&#x27;s name suggests and this looked nice but he did not keep it in that style for long.  I tried using this Axe gel to slick my hair back and it kept it off my face all day.  The citrus like scent is not too heavy for younger kids.</li>
    <li> Axe recently released a whole new line of mousse and gel products. This one provides a medium hold and requires only the slightest amount of product to be used. What worries me is the list of chemical ingredients that are in this product. If you worry about putting chemicals in your hair, I&#x27;d recommend avoiding this product and trying something much more natural instead.</li>
    <li> This gel does work just as advertised to get a shiny, looks-like-its-still wet hold to hair. I like it for this purpose, but it has a smell that I don&#x27;t really like and my wife hates. When I use it, when she gets too close she says, \\&quot;You used that gel again didn&#x27;t you. It stinks!\\&quot; and she runs away. It seems like that&#x27;s supposed to be the opposite of what Axe advertises. This seems to be a consistent problem for me with Axe hair products, the scents are horrible. I recommend you smell it first before you buy.</li>
    <li> When I put the gel min the morning, it looks good. It creates volume and that wet look.  However, the gel looses its strength mid-day.  So, i would use it when going out at night, but not when you need it work all day.  The texture of the gel isn&#x27;t as gelly as other hair gels.</li>
    <li> This works well for me (male, short hair) and also had a nice pleasant a light scent.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This has a pleasant fragrance, light and not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It creates a wet and shiny appearance on hair. It helps keep hair in place and is good for styling hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using too much can cause a filmy residue and you should avoid applying more than one application to hair.It can be used for all hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a decent, average product.</li>
    <li> If you have really short hair and use just a tiny bit of this gel, as if it is a pomade, you will probably be ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have longer hair...even just 2-3 inches, you&#x27;re going to end up looking greasy and stringy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually, \\&quot;wet shine\\&quot; or \\&quot;wet look\\&quot; labeled hair gels are the type of gel that gets really stiff/has a lot of holding power and, well, gives a wet look. This is not that kind of gel. There is barely any holding power at all. It simply reminds me more of a pomade type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 2 stars. Not really my idea of a gel and seems to only be suitable for really short hair, just to sort of give a finished look, without any styling or holding power needed.. like a pomade.</li>
    <li> Really like the look...not hard and crunchy</li>
    <li> The title says doesn&#x27;t look to overdone, but it does. It reminded me of old-school gel with that crusty wet look. We preferr a more natural/mild wet. Again axe hits the mark with the scent but this isn&#x27;t our favorite.</li>
    <li> Great hold and great look.  This is a very good wet gel.  Easy to apply, just be careful not to use too much.  Start with a little and go from there in order to avoid a \\&quot;crusty\\&quot; application.  I like using this on the weekend, but it has an herbal scent that I feel is a bit much for the office environment, at least for a middle-aged guy like me!  But the quality of the product is excellent, and I highly recommend it.  If they could ease up on the scent a little, it would be an easy five stars.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this Axe Wet Shine Gel. Loves the smell, loves the wet look, loves the lack of extreme stiffness while still holding well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little less enthusiastic about it. as the smell is sort of strong and not altogether attractive and I&#x27;m not loving the wet look. But I do like that his hair isn&#x27;t crusty feeling.And that he&#x27;s pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a wet look gel that holds well, this may very well be perfect for you. It just depends on how strong you like your fragrance.</li>
    <li> In my house we love Axe. I love the way it keeps both hubby and my son smelling good and we use a variety of Axe products. Sadly, we won&#x27;t be using this one again. It does offer a wet look but it also makes the hair very crunchy which isn&#x27;t very appealing. We love many of Axe&#x27;s other products, but this one is not one we will buy again.</li>
    <li> Pushing the big 80, I feel quite fortunate to still have lots of hair...not as much as I used to, but still ample.  And so this product is A okay with me.  It does put a shine in my hair and I like the light citrussy scent.  What more could an old geezer ask for?</li>
