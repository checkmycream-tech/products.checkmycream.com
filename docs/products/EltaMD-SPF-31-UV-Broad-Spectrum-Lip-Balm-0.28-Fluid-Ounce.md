      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>Went on smooth, tastes and smells great.</li>
      <li>In the meantime, this product is nice, leaves lips shiny, but I wish it were a stick applicator, not the squeeze applicator.  </li>
      <li>He said he really liked it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to know I have protection under my lipstick.  </li>
      <li>It has a creamy texture, no fragrance and goes on very easily.  </li>
      <li>It matches my skin and goes on very easily.  </li>
      <li>I love the way this lip balm feels, very smooth and weightless not sticky at all.</li>
      <li>The Cotz brand sunblock lip balm is much better.</li>
      <li>She told me she used this every day under makeup and assured me I would love it.</li>
      <li>but I do love this brand and the lack of chemicals in their products.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product!</li>
      <li>I wish the product was a bit thicker so it would feel more like a lip balm.</li>
      <li>Love EltaMD sunscreen products.</li>
      <li>Love this lip balm.  </li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I love how this has sunscreen in it, but it does not feel moisturizing, which is what I like.</li>
      <li>This was recommended by my dermatologist, but Amazon&#x27;s price is much better.</li>
      <li>Slips off your lips right into your mouth - does not taste good, either</li>
      <li>It spreads easily, but not too easily.</li>
      <li>would recommend this to anyone looking for a strong SPF</li>
      <li>This is the first product for lips that I&#x27;ve really liked.</li>
      <li>In the house, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s very good protection from the sun, but it feels a little greasy on my lips</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this Chapstick.</li>
      <li>Not goopy, Goes on smooth and lasts.</li>
      <li>Smooth and pleasant for the few moments</li>
      <li>but, for some reason is much more effective than using the regular, old time zinc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but I think in the warmer month it will be plenty on its own, on face, neck, ears, and back of hand.</li>
      <li>But, shouldn&#x27;t the fact that it isn&#x27;t sensory friendly when it claims to be sensitivity free, a big deal for you?  </li>
      <li>Firstly, it has an agreeable flavor--a bit like mint chip ice cream.</li>
      <li>A fellow swimmer recommended this product and it is the first product that I see works.  </li>
      <li>When I first got this is was creamy, but after about 2 weeks it was soupy and liquid.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly, and the product is not heavy like a lip balm.</li>
      <li>Worked exactly as I hoped it would.</li>
      <li>First, I wish EltaMD would make a purely zinc oxide lip product.  </li>
      <li>Third, it protects my lips from sunburn (and mine do tend to burn pretty easily).</li>
      <li>We use the facial version of EltaMD and enjoy it very much so decided to try this as well.  </li>
      <li>The product is okay, wish it were more of a moisturizing stay on product like chapstick, but it is more just a sunscreen thing, not sure would be any different to take the regular lotion and use on lips.</li>
      <li>- it is 50 - and it works really, really well.</li>
      <li>It does not leave your lips white; however it does leave them covered and smooth.</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>This stuff works really well and keeps your lips moisturized while being protected from sun damage.</li>
      <li>Instantly absorbs and feels comfortable.</li>
      <li>Love other EltaMD SPF products.</li>
      <li>But, I kinda would like that and the High SPF.</li>
      <li>the lip balm is new to me</li>
      <li>I received the lip balm and was happily surprised that it not only protects you from UV rays, but your lips are smooth and not dry at all</li>
      <li>It has a slight minty taste, but it&#x27;s not at all offensive or strong</li>
      <li>Beware if you have sensitive skin!  </li>
      <li>Love their other products that I have tried, but this one is a BIG loser.  </li>
      <li>It does leave a white film on your lips, at first.</li>
      <li>It is a clear zinc</li>
      <li>Applies easliy and leave lips feeling soft and moist.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t even cover very well, and doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
      <li>I expected more from Elta MD because I like their other sunscreens.</li>
      <li>It has sunblock in it, check, but otherwise it does not seem particularly moisturizing nor does it seem to last on my lips.</li>
      <li>I use a lot of Elta MD products... sunblocks and lotions galore and most of which I love, but I was a bit disappointed in this product.</li>
      <li>I spend most of the year outside in a pool for at least one hour per day.  </li>
      <li>I have to use major sunblock (meds) and EltaMD was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>

<li> It feels like a regular lip balm, it is not sticky or heavy.  </li>
<li> EVERY TIME I buy this way before it&#x27;s even close to empty, like 2 months away from empty!</li>
<li> One way or the other it is not quite what I had expected.</li>
<li> The only criticism would be that on cold mornings, the balm is too thick to get out of the tube easily.</li>
<li> Feels soothing &amp; lasts longer than other lip balms</li>
<li> No lanolin or other irritants.</li>
<li> I can no longer use Blistex or the like due to lip sensitivities and I can use this.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll try the other.</li>
<li> Not good enough for the price.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s tasteless and very convenient.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No more sunburned lips.  Works very well.</li>
    <li> The produce arrived on time and was well packaged.  I love the way this lip balm feels, very smooth and weightless not sticky at all.</li>
    <li> Not goopy, Goes on smooth and lasts. After a bout with skin cancer, I am using what I can to keep a recurrence at bay. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> EltaMD makes great skin care/sun protection products. the lip balm is new to me but I find it the equal of the other Elta products I have purchased..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s very good protection from the sun, but it feels a little greasy on my lips so I don&#x27;t want to wear it.</li>
    <li> I love how this has sunscreen in it, but it does not feel moisturizing, which is what I like.</li>
    <li> too watery and vaseline like. Slips off your lips right into your mouth - does not taste good, either</li>
    <li> This lip balm is better than all of the expensive, name brand products I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Since my dermatologist recommends, and uses, Elta products I begin using them myself.  Love their other products that I have tried, but this one is a BIG loser.  Tried it only once and within 2 minutes my lips were swollen and burned!  Will never give it a second try.  Beware if you have sensitive skin!  Although as I have said I use and like their other sunscreen products, I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one!</li>
    <li> Seems protective. Just use it occasionally because I wear lipstick. Maybe I should be using it under the lipstick?</li>
    <li> My exercise of choice is long distance swimming.  I spend most of the year outside in a pool for at least one hour per day.  Because I was concerned about my skin I tried every sun block I could find, including the colored zincs and no matter what, at the end of the hour in a pool my face was fried.  A fellow swimmer recommended this product and it is the first product that I see works.  It has a creamy texture, no fragrance and goes on very easily.  It is a clear zinc but, for some reason is much more effective than using the regular, old time zinc.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking for a strong SPF - it is 50 - and it works really, really well.</li>
    <li> This is the first product for lips that I&#x27;ve really liked. Firstly, it has an agreeable flavor--a bit like mint chip ice cream. Secondly, I like the texture. It spreads easily, but not too easily. Third, it protects my lips from sunburn (and mine do tend to burn pretty easily). This was recommended by my dermatologist, but Amazon&#x27;s price is much better.</li>
    <li> One way or the other it is not quite what I had expected. I use a lot of Elta MD products... sunblocks and lotions galore and most of which I love, but I was a bit disappointed in this product. It has sunblock in it, check, but otherwise it does not seem particularly moisturizing nor does it seem to last on my lips. It goes onto the lips as a milky white lotion and stays visible (like white lip gloss) until it soaks in. It is expensive for what it is (there are better options) and not particularly special in any other way. I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Went on smooth, tastes and smells great. Worked exactly as I hoped it would.</li>
    <li> When I first got this is was creamy, but after about 2 weeks it was soupy and liquid.  Had it in my pocketbook and I&#x27;m not sure if that had anything to do with it.  I bought two, so I&#x27;ll try the other.</li>
    <li> First, I wish EltaMD would make a purely zinc oxide lip product.  In the meantime, this product is nice, leaves lips shiny, but I wish it were a stick applicator, not the squeeze applicator.  It&#x27;s difficult to get the proper amount on your lips.  It has a slight minty taste, but it&#x27;s not at all offensive or strong (I wish it had no taste, but at least this is much less annoying than other products).</li>
    <li> This lip balm,  just used before exposure to the sun, is not addicting like some others that you can&#x27;t do without once you&#x27;ve used them.  Your lips will still moisturize themselves if you don&#x27;t overuse this product.  And it gives great protection from the sun.  It is tasteless and creamy and lasts if you don&#x27;t lick your lips.</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm.  Love EltaMD sunscreen products.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this lip balm nearly often enough because it sinks to the bottom of my purse.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no after taste. It goes on smoothly, and the product is not heavy like a lip balm.</li>
    <li> Gave this product to a friend who had a lesion on his lip.  After he had it removed, I gave him the Lip Balm.  He said he really liked it.</li>
    <li> I wish the product was a bit thicker so it would feel more like a lip balm.</li>
    <li> This lip balm is great, I have had no fever blisters, since using this product. Itwas reccommended  by my Dermotologist</li>
    <li> Not good enough for the price. Goes on and stays white for a while. What&#x27;s worse is that the squeeze applicator breaks at the neck EVERY TIME I buy this way before it&#x27;s even close to empty, like 2 months away from empty! The Cotz brand sunblock lip balm is much better.</li>
    <li> Applies easliy and leave lips feeling soft and moist.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT SUNSCREEN!!!  AS A SKIN CANCER PATIENT, THIS IS THE BEST SUNSCREEN I HAVE FOUND TO BLOCK HARMFUL RAYS!</li>
    <li> Very nice lip balm.  It&#x27;s tasteless and very convenient.  It disappears and doesn&#x27;t affect my lipstick at all.  It&#x27;s nice to know I have protection under my lipstick.  Elta MD is great.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Never feels greasy.</li>
    <li> perhaps this is why their products are so expensive, such a tiny thing and so much packaging. The product is okay, wish it were more of a moisturizing stay on product like chapstick, but it is more just a sunscreen thing, not sure would be any different to take the regular lotion and use on lips.</li>
    <li> The only criticism would be that on cold mornings, the balm is too thick to get out of the tube easily. In the afternoons, it is quite liquid-y. I love the balm, but am afraid that I&#x27;ll damage the tube trying to get it out in the mornings.... This is when camping, of course. In the house, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, excellent protection! Elta, the best in the business</li>
    <li> Has a bit of a weird taste but I do love this brand and the lack of chemicals in their products.</li>
    <li> I told my doctor I was looking for a high SPF face cream/sunscreen that didn&#x27;t feel heavy, or show up as white. She told me she used this every day under makeup and assured me I would love it. I do. In the winter I sometimes put a bit of regular facial moisturizer under  the dry spots but I think in the warmer month it will be plenty on its own, on face, neck, ears, and back of hand. Instantly absorbs and feels comfortable. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> This was surprising- it&#x27;s like Vaseline (and I dislike the texture and feel of Vaseline) only thinner, so it doesn&#x27;t even cover very well, and doesn&#x27;t last. I&#x27;m normally a big fan of Elta MD sunscreen products, but I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Leaves you lips white - does not blend in well</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me to protect my lips from sun exposure  This lip balm is perfect for people with lupus.</li>
    <li> This product irritated my lips to the point where I stopped using it thinking I may have an allergic reaction to the balm.</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well and keeps your lips moisturized while being protected from sun damage. I totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> Feels soothing &amp; lasts longer than other lip balms</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this Chapstick. It does not leave your lips white; however it does leave them covered and smooth. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  We use the facial version of EltaMD and enjoy it very much so decided to try this as well.  It feels like a regular lip balm, it is not sticky or heavy.  We use it on our kids as well.  Very nice quality!</li>
    <li> Works great!  Like the moisturizing effect of the balm,</li>
    <li> I have to use major sunblock (meds) and EltaMD was recommended by my dermatologist. I received the lip balm and was happily surprised that it not only protects you from UV rays, but your lips are smooth and not dry at all and it lasts for HOURS-will order again!</li>
    <li> It dried out my lips and made the condition of them worse. Very disappointed in this product. At $10 each it&#x27;s a total waste of money. I expected more from Elta MD because I like their other sunscreens.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen.  It matches my skin and goes on very easily.  I wish I had known about it sooner!</li>
    <li> Got this product orginally at a hotsy-totsy spa and over paid.  It&#x27;s a great product so I was so happy I could get a better deal on Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have pre cancer cells on my lip. My dermotalogist recommended it. I love it. It moistens your lips while protecting. Not greasey. And you can carry it anywhere! Highy recommend!</li>
    <li> I can no longer use Blistex or the like due to lip sensitivities and I can use this.</li>
    <li> It does leave a white film on your lips, at first.</li>
    <li> Got this from Dr Raines office in Austin&lt;br /&gt;And have recommended it to several friends .... Rave reviews all around</li>
    <li> It smells and feels like mint, and is too pricey. Some don&#x27;t like the petroleum base. But, I kinda would like that and the High SPF. if I could actually use it. The SPF and the fact I had to try it, to test it. were the only reasons it was purchased. These aren&#x27;t my only reasons for the low rating. But, shouldn&#x27;t the fact that it isn&#x27;t sensory friendly when it claims to be sensitivity free, a big deal for you?  Not repeating this purchase, obviously.</li>
    <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t like the product is the flavoring contains mint - to which I am allergic. Otherwise, this is a great formulation. Not sticky. Smooth and pleasant for the few moments I tried it! Love other EltaMD SPF products. No lanolin or other irritants.</li>
