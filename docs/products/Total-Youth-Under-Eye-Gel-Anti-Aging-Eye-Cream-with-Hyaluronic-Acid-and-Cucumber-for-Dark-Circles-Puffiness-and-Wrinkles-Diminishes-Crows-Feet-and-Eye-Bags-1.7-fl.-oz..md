<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fair results, not long lasting</li>
    <li> I do like this eye gel. It is a gel and not a cream per se. It is cooling, refreshing and just feels good and it does help much with puffiness. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> Wonderful  product! Noticed a difference in 2 days</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream! Cooling and soothing I immediately felt the puffiness subside</li>
    <li> I really like the consistency of this cream.  It&#x27;s actually more like a gel and it reminds me of this other product I used to use that was $100 a bottle.  It&#x27;s supposed to be for your eyes, but since it reminds me of the other stuff I used to use, I&#x27;ve been using it all over my face.  I like it so far!</li>
    <li> This is a fragrance-free cream with a great ingredient list. The container is way bigger than any other eye cream I&#x27;ve seen! I use it all over my face. It leaves a slightly sticky surface but I use my moisturizer after this which takes care of it. Hard to say what the benefits have been or will be, but with these ingredients, and thoughtful protective packaging, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> I like the cucumber make your eyes feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> I have terrible dark spots under my eyes. I usually cover it up with makeup buy decided to try this stuff after I was given a coupon for it. it has a very light, gel consistency and not greasy. It&#x27;s easy to apply. I use it under my makeup for now before I leave the house. It appears to have reduced the intensity of my spots somewhat,  so far.</li>
    <li> I am 20 yrs old and although I don&#x27;t necessarily need an eye cream I got this for free so I use it. It is never to early to start this process of preventing aging. I don&#x27;t necessarily see any difference but I&#x27;m assuming that is b/c I don&#x27;t have anything to reduce. I personally love VoilaVe products and I support this company 100% I am sure this product is very good and I gave this 3 stars mainly b/c I haven&#x27;t noticed a change personally in my skin however there Rosehip oil is AMAZING and has done wonders for my skin.</li>
    <li> OK, I&#x27;m hooked!  At the moment I am using 3 of the ViolaVe products.  I start with their &amp;#34;Triple Action Vitamin C Serum,&amp;#34; let it dry, then apply the 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum (again letting it dry) and THEN, the Total Youth Eye Gel.  Although it&#x27;s geared for the eye area, I do use it all over the face area.  Not sure how cost productive using all 3 products is but a little goes a long way, particularly when layering.  As for the results - my skin does look amazing.  That&#x27;s the important thing, right?  In particular I have noticed a great improvement of those fine lines around the lip due to aging since I have never smoked.  Also, my pores have been greatly minimized which makes the foundation rather flawless.  Lastly, regarding the eye gel, I rather like it for the firming properties.  A recommendation I would have is that when the ViolaVe products go on sale, do as I do and purchase 2 - 3 bottles at a time which greatly saves in the end.  Just store in a cool dry place and they will be fine.  Lastly, I will turn 71 this month and can honestly and happily say that people still think I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s.  Staying in great physical shape helps but even more so is having beautiful skin!</li>
    <li> This eye gel works wonders.  My eyes look brighter and fine lines smooth in a relatively short period of time.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have only used this gel a couple of times but it really does seem to calm my tired eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually have dark circles but I do have puffiness sometimes I think due to allergies and this did help to tame the puffiness and leave a cooling effect.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the wrinkles go, I only have very fine crows feet as I am only 30 but I will come back and update the results I get on that.</li>
    <li> Oh I can&#x27;t explain how much I love this stuff!!! Dark circles and puffiness just runs in the family and I don&#x27;t have either cause of this :)</li>
    <li> Stings my eyes a little bit sure if it really helped my circles or the puffiness...</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I have been using it for a couple of months and my dark under eye circles are gone.  The only reason I gave it four stars is because it is hard to use under makeup due to flaking.</li>
    <li> Volaive cream cools my skin around the my eyes, and leaves it feeling super smooth. This actually DOES remove those pesky dark under eye circles! I was super impressed with this product and use it daily.It has a great quality cucumber cream and it feels great on the eyes, and most of all the results speak for themselves. I have periodic swelling around my face that makes me look puffy but after applying this product it goes down quite a bit. I enjoy feeling like I have something like this in my back pocket in case some stuff goes down on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if I keep using it, I will feel like a baby! Lol. I am happy with results and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully. It left my eye feeling nice and refreshed. I often lack sleep a lot so it&#x27;s ability to fight against my dark circles is amazing.</li>
    <li> The product was nice and soothing for the eyes. Due to my lack of sleep I always have dark circles. This products seems to be able to refresh my eyes giving it a less tired look.</li>
    <li> Really like it a lot. Also price-wise. Wonderful stuff, including the light, natural smell. Will order again and also try some of their other products.</li>
    <li> Didnt get the immeadiate change the product talks about delivering.  But its got so much great stuff in it, it has to be good for the skin around the eye area so ill keep using it.</li>
    <li> Like many others, I have used so many eye creams and most of them expensive with little results. VoilaVe has been amazing! I am shocked by how well it works. My circles are far less noticeable and the puffiness is completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;If that isn&#x27;t good enough, the fine lines I have are either gone or less noticeable. Where they are gone is from around my mouth, they were faintly coming in and now they are completely gone! I found my HG!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work that well.  See no difference in puffiness or reduction of lines.</li>
    <li> Delivery was as promised...have been using 2x daily and see no results. Has not helped with under eye bags or puffiness.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. I used almost the entire bottle and did not notice any change.</li>
    <li> So far, so good - great price, great product!</li>
    <li> I purchased and had excellent delivery and have been using for about a week  I truly like this product BUT do not like the container and how is distributes the cream  Very unpractical and much prefer a container with visibility of contents and how much is being used so you can use all of the product and have access to it.  Also, the messages on the container are difficult to read. I would very much like to reorder if modification were made to the packaging end use of the cream.    UPDATE  December 5 2014    I wrote to the Founders of the product and received an excellent and speedy response from Susan Co-Founder and I truly appreciate her response.  I do like the gel and am starting to experience some results of the dark circles and am hopeful and only dislike the packaging but do like the gel and am also hopeful regarding the C serum.  Catherine aka Catinaredhat.       Reponse from Susan Co-Founder of Voila Ve  It&#x27;s great to hear from you, and thank you so much for taking the time to respond!

Please always feel free to email me again if you have any questions or concerns, and I will get back to you immediately.    Warm regards,  Susan  Co-Founder, VoilaVe</li>
    <li> I waited to review this product to give it time to work.  I knew it wouldn&#x27;t do anything for my dark circles or wrinkles but I had hopes that it might decrease the puffiness and bags.  I am sorry to say that it did not work at all.  I&#x27;m glad others have been satisfied with this product but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> saw a difference immediately. no i am not cured but when i am out i see the difference. good purchase and price was fair to me. i will buy more and some for my mom.</li>
    <li> This product is doing  just as it states......will reorder.</li>
    <li> I use this all over my face (allowed as per directions), and my skin is looking great now. I&#x27;ll be buying this again. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Had a very cooling effect, but did nothing for my dark circle.</li>
    <li> I expected better because of all the great reviews. It was sticky (no matter how thin i applied it) and made my wrinkles STICK TOGETHER- like it glued them together so you could see them way more, and i worried it would just make them worse since it was holding the wrinkle like that. It also came with a little flyer that said that it wouldn&#x27;t work unless you went to their website and ordered a bunch of other products (and btw, their link didn&#x27;t work anyway). I think it&#x27;s some sort of SCAM.</li>
    <li> Really Nice...Nice and Light...used for a few days and noticed a difference in the puffiness of my eyelids...Very Happy!!</li>
    <li> It is too thick, doesn&#x27;t absorb fast enough in the mornings to apply makeup over it.</li>
    <li> Am happy with the results.  I definitely see a difference in dark circles</li>
    <li> I have been using this product every day since it arrived.  I love that it is sealed to prevent bacteria to get into it and the formula pumps out with ease.  The pump distributes just the right amount of product, it feels so fresh and the feel of it going on is so soothing! I have dark circles under my eyes and fine lines too.  Viola Ve Eye Gel by Emagine has helped to diminish the look of the fine lines, smoothed out the skin under my eyes and reduces the appearance of dark circles!  I am so happy I found this!  I did receive a free product from VoilaVe and their PR firm for the purpose of testing.  My review is my own honest opinion and I am happy to declare that I love it!!</li>
    <li> I used this product for at least two weeks. The company that sells it contacted me repeatedly with follow up emails, trying to find out if I enjoyed it. I replied, telling them that I was not ready for a review, as I needed more time to test the product. I see a lot of 5 star reviews, and I couldn&#x27;t tell if they were based on genuine great results, or influenced by the warm, friendly emails that customers received from the company.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is very rich and seems to be heavy when you first touch it, but you will realize that it is, in fact, lighter than expected. Not at all greasy, it gives a sense of freshness and leaves the skin soft and pleasant to touch. Unfortunately, this is a short lived feeling. Half an hour later, the dryness returns.&lt;br /&gt;The cream has been hailed by its seller as being &#x27;the best under eye gel treatment solution for crows feet, dry skin, fine lines, eye bags &amp; sagging eyes.&#x27; Furthermore, it is claimed that it &#x27;goes after those dark under eye circles, making them lighter and diminishing their appearance&#x27; and that it &#x27;gives you face a youthful glow and reverses signs of aging.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, only fine lines underneath my eyes, and barely visible crows feet. I also have dark circles. The skin, both on my face and under my eyes tends to be quite dry. I have not seen one bit of improvement for any of these imperfections, although I have diligently used the cream as per the instructions. I guess that if this cream was as good as it says it is, it would sell in major stores, not online.&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry that this product has not worked for me as good as it is claimed by other people that it worked for them. I am giving it three stars for the short lived feeling of freshness, but if it wasn&#x27;t for that I would give it 1 star. It does not work as expected.</li>
    <li> Smells good and moisturizes well, but remains a bit sticky throughout the day</li>
    <li> This eye gel is wonderfully soothing. I apply it all over my eye even the kids and there is no sting or irritation whatsoever. I am sure given time it will help with those nasty wrinkles. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Fast received, good quality</li>
    <li> Arrived with quite a bit squished out inside the cap.  Was packaged in its own box so not sure how that happened.  Been using for a few days.. Will update review in a few weeks.  So far no noticeable change with eye bags or darkness</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a light gel like texture that does instantly feel fresh when you apply it. Personally I felt it dried out my under eyes as opposed to moisturizing it. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month and it did not reduce my very slight wrinkle or my dark circles. Also I would not recommend this to those with sensitive eyes, some nights it makes my eyes burn.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t order, said the code had already been redeemed</li>
    <li> I love this company: they don&#x27;t test on animals, and they don&#x27;t make my hyper-sensitive skin break out at all. As for whether it actually works as an anti-aging cream, only time will tell, but I actually have noticed a difference in my dark circles! I&#x27;m VERY excited about that!</li>
    <li> This eye gel smells lovely and just like cucumber.  I use it both at night and in the morning.  The product is silky smooth and adsorbs into the skin nicely. I like that it makes me look more awake and I have noticed my fine lines are going away.</li>
    <li> Smells great and does not leave a greasy or sticky residue on my skin. Works great on those nights I don&#x27;t get enough sleep!</li>
    <li> This is nice and cooling. Very refreshing and I can already see the bags under my eyes starting to fade away. Love it!</li>
    <li> This was my second order of this product. I haven&#x27;t noticed that it reduces puffiness or dark circles, but I like the way it feels, and works as well as any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a week now, and already have noticed a reduction in the wrinkles under my eyes.  I haven&#x27;t noticed my dark circles getting better yet, but the puffiness is down too!</li>
    <li> It does seem to make my face feel tingly and fresh so the puffiness looks less noticable.  However, it also seems to dry out my skin so I have to put moisturizer on as well.</li>
    <li> First of all I really liked the light cucumber smell.  It felt really light and airy going on. I didn&#x27;t feel greasy or nasty. It seems to work really well. I have a two year old and another one on the way I don&#x27;t get as much sleep as I like so I feel like its helped me looked less tired and sleepy and my eyes more bright and revived.  I Recommend this product. It also seemed to take the puffiness away!</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my entire face and not just under my eyes as the directions state that that is okay.  It also says you can wear it under makeup and all day long which I really like.  I have been in the habit of putting it on in the morning.  It has  a VERY VERY slight cooling sensation which I like that feeling in the morning as oppose to the night.  It is very slight though so if you don&#x27;t like that feeling, don&#x27;t not buy the product just because of that comment.  It also feels like it tightens my skin a VERY small bit which I also enjoy the feeling of.  I haven&#x27;t noticed an under eye improvement yet but I am not sure if that is supposed to work immediately or not.  I would buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I like it! After 2 applications, I notice the bags under my eyes are beginning to lighten which makes me look much younger. I will use this everyday after I shower.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my 65 year old cousin for her birthday.. she loves it!  She will order more soon!  ALSO I JUST ORDERED THREE MORE, ONE FOR MYSELF, AND ONE FOR EACH OF MY BEST FRIENDS.. I WILL ALWAYS USE IT!</li>
    <li> I tried this product for the same reason I always do when I stray from my usual product lines, a lot more product at a price similar to what I&#x27;ve been paying for a lot less. That alone is what usually gets my attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been using eye gels/creams for over a year now, and have been mostly pleased with the results right from the start, so for me, anything I&#x27;m using is more daily regimen to maintain my eyes. I&#x27;ve been using this product exclusively since receiving it so I could review it realistically. During this period, I had been on the road for days, and I smoke like a tire fire, so I may have looked human when I left the house, but I was way scary looking when I got home, &amp;#34;The Walking Dead&amp;#34; kind of scary.... really. Had to get right back on the road too, so shower, shave, this stuff all over the black streaks around my eyes, and I got to say I may have not looked brand new, but all the black and a bunch of the swelling had vanished! I was impressed!</li>
    <li> great stuff everyone over 50 needs this product</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this eye gel!!  its cooling which feels great after a long day and really seems to be helping with my fine lines and wrinkles and at 51 i can sure use the help lol..i would surely recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> really cooling on the eyes</li>
    <li> I like its non greasy feel, and the ease of use. Very efficient.</li>
    <li> Awsome cream going to buy a second bottle....a week using it and i can already see the results this gel is worth the price i will deff let my friends and family know how fast this gel works.!!! Im so happy with this gel and glad i got it...i hope you guys try it out too its worth the try and you wont regret it.!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS ALOT</li>
    <li> Bought it recently and it does amazing work</li>
    <li> works great, immediate positive results</li>
    <li> Looking forward to this!</li>
    <li> I like this product, a little heavy on the scent but exactly what I needed for my dark bags under my eyes!</li>
    <li> I really love this item. I waited until I used the product for a little over a week before I reviewed to see if I could see any changes. I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the results. I use the product in the morning and in the evening. I&#x27;ve been using it almost every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is thick and a lot goes a long way, so really - only put half a squirt on the tip of your finger and use that for both under-eyes. The product states that you can use it all over your face, but I&#x27;m fortunate (or unfortunate?) enough that I only need it under my eyes. I have an eye bag problem - puffy under-eyes that are a little dark but not too dark. Mostly puffy, loose skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using the product, I have seen my skin start to heal itself. Though it is not perfect and my eye-bags are not completely gone, it has only been a little over a week and I can make it a point to comment on this review when the bottle is finished to let everyone know if it is worth purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I use this product after using the VoilaVe Triple Action Vitamin C Serum + Hyaluronic Acid in the morning and evening.  It&#x27;s very soothing with the cucumber in it.  I&#x27;ve noticed I have more moisture again under my eyes making them look and feel more youthful.  I use a generous amount at night and a much smaller amount in the morning so it won&#x27;t interfere with my make-up.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many eye  gels and eye creams and so far this one has worked the best for my puffy eyes and dark circles. The price is reasonable and the delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> Noticeable difference in puffiness and dark circles under eyes after using this product for 10 days.  Smells good too!</li>
    <li> Great product really works. I saw a difference after night one</li>
    <li> Love this stuff... Very refreshing scent, very light in skin and works very well!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a week now and I can already see the dark circles under my eyes disappearing. I will definitely recommend this product to family and friends. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This eye gel is very nice.  I use it all over my face and under my eyes.  It has refined my skin since I started using it about a month ago.  What I&#x27;ve noticed so far is smoother skin, less blotchiness, brighter color, and some wrinkle smoothing.  The improvements may be small, but I think they&#x27;re definitive and so I will definitely keep using this product.  It comes in a translucent gel in a pump bottle.  I don&#x27;t fully depress the pump because I put it on in sections (ie: right side of face, forehead, etc.) and I don&#x27;t want to use too much and waste it.  A nice thin layer is all you need.  It spreads easily, but also dries quickly.  It has an extremely mild scent of cucumbers and dries scentless.  It&#x27;s packed with wonderful ingredients for the skin and I love using it every am and pm.  In the beginning I tended to use a little too much and when dry it had a slight tackiness to it, but once I thinned the layer out, there is much less of that.  I put sunscreen over it for daytime.  Makeup goes very well over it from primer to BB creams to foundation, to powder.(it doesn&#x27;t bead up at all for me), but just make sure the layer is dry before you put anything over it.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I could see an improvement in just a few days. Love it !</li>
    <li> Noticed results in no time!</li>
    <li> This product feels nice going on, not sticky or greasy and absorbs quickly.  I use it on my whole face!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen noticeable  improvement with use of this product. I have very sensitive skin and it hasn&#x27;t irritated it at all!</li>
    <li> Nice cool application. Happy with product!</li>
    <li> This eye cream has dramatically improved the puffiness and dark circles around my eyes.  I was skeptical when I first purchased it, but it worked very quickly on my eyes.  It REALLY does a great job.</li>
    <li> I love this Eye Gel!!  I can notice the dark circles going away every time I use the product and it is reducing the lines on my forehead.  I recommend people to try this product!!  IT is amazing!!  I was asked to review this product and give my honest opinion on the product and so far it is GREAT!!  Thank you for choosing me to review your product!!</li>
    <li> after 1 weeks using the cream, i vave more visible dark circles, and show up lines on i used</li>
    <li> I have only had this for a short time but I do see and feel a difference under my eyes.  The skin feels firmer and softer.</li>
    <li> I think it has helped the under-eye dark circles.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t expect to be a big bottle which is a plus! looking forward to use it!!</li>
    <li> Great! I feel a nice tightness when I put it on. The bottle is a little smaller than I thought it would be.... but you really don&#x27;t have to use much, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll last me a while. I have used other brands that felt like they worked slightly better, but they are way more expensive.</li>
    <li> Just started using your eye cream so it is difficult to answer your question.&lt;br /&gt;I am a women  in her 70&#x27;s so it may take some time.&lt;br /&gt;Cherri</li>
    <li> I cannot say if or how well this eye gel works because I was unable to use it. As soon as I put it around my eye my skin starting burning and a few seconds later my eye started watering. I immediately stuck my face under the sink faucet to rinse it off. I do not recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin, especially sensitive skin around the eyes.</li>
    <li> Received this product for review. I like this eye cream. I have noticed some reduction to darkness and under eye bags. My eye area doesn&#x27;t itch as much as it did before which is nice. It has a pleasant cucumber smell. The container is well designed and it is easy to get enough to use without a mess using the pump at the top. Just right without waste, which is nice. I like it and will likely purchase more in the future as this container runs out.</li>
    <li> The scent is pretty and it feels cool.  However it is a little sticky afterwards and I padded it with a little pressed powder, it was ok...</li>
    <li> I love this cream, and use it on my entire face. It&#x27;s really more of a gel, and unlike most other moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried, it doesn&#x27;t ball up under my foundation or make my skin look or feel greasy. There is no SPF in it, so you&#x27;ll need a separate sunscreen. I really prefer to apply sunscreen separately on top anyway, though. Also try the vitamin C serum!</li>
    <li> I just applied my morning Voila Ve Eye Cream to my seventy-three year-old face, and have again experienced the coolness and soothing effect which occurs each time.  The bonus comes as the dark circles have diminished considerably (using it daily for three months), and my under eye  situation looks much improved.  Give it time to settle in (it is very light) prior to applying whatever makeup the day calls for.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for at least six months and it is amazing!  It not only firms and tightens my eye area but does the sAme great job over my whole face and neck!  Skin tightens, wrinkles vanish and a youthful face emerges!  It&#x27;s extremely concentrated so a small dot covers your eyes, face and neck. Love this product!</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product!  Makes my 68 year old wrinkles a little less noticeable!!  Use on entire face</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few days and thr difference in the under eye puffiness is just what I was looking for! Tightens and reduces the bags while making your eyes look renewed!:)</li>
    <li> I recieved this product through snagshout.  I liked the product!  It has a pleasant odor, and seemed to work ok.</li>
    <li> Works great and you will see a difference</li>
    <li> This eye cream has a great pump action to dispense the product--no messy caps which I really like. It is a fairly large bottle; so you get a decent amount for the price. However; I would prefer a smaller size for traveling. The scent is not overpowering; but yet a very refreshing scent of cucumber.  The product is not greasy.  I applied the product to my under eye area--and as it dried my skin felt noticeably firm. -I did notice a slight decrease in the dark circles under my eye. -There is a mild cooling sensation when first applied. -Definitely has a firm feel to the area applied. -I mainly used it around my eyes. -I really like how it is made of organice ingredients; and that it is hypoallergenic and does not contain parabens, sulfates or alcohol. I also love the Aloe--makes for a nice creamy moisturizer.  It also adds to the refreshing scent.</li>
    <li> I received this as a promo to test and I love and aware by it. It really is a great product</li>
    <li> I like it so far but hasn&#x27;t helped my dark circles yet so I will give it more time.</li>
    <li> Love how it feels going on to early to tell if working</li>
    <li> Its ok, probly will not reorder thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 4 days now I like the refreshing feel of it I have dark circles so far no improvement yet</li>
    <li> Amazing product! I love the gentle beautiful fragrance of this eye cream. I&#x27;m usually sensitive in the eye area but my skin tolerated this product really well. I would have given it 5 stars but I don&#x27;t like how the pump malfunctions some times making it cumbersome to retrieve product. This skin care item is a must have!</li>
    <li> Smells great and fresh...skin feels a bit tight.  Does it de-puff eyes?  No.  The only way to do this is see a dermatogist and get prescription strength cream or have the fat removed.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, convenient, does exactly what it states and more. Love the way my face looks. No need to pile on a bunch of concealers and foundations, also used on my face and his under eye wrinkles lines are more fine and less visible</li>
    <li> delighted with product</li>
    <li> VoilaVe Eye Cream started firming and smoothing the skin near my eyes within just 3 days! It has a nice, yet not overpowering, cucumber scent. The dispenser is smooth and allows me to get exactly the right amount of cream for my preferences. No complaints! This bottle will probably last me 6 months!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister as a gift. She always complaining about her dark circles and having to put makeup on. Now with this eye cream her dark circles are vanishing.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a good product but eye creams tend to take extended use to really notice a difference. This stuff goes on smooth and definitely hydrates for hours. I like it and will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous eye gel.  Almost over night my dark circles became lighter.  The gel smells great and is not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> VoileVe Eye Cream for Dark Circles and puffiness - got this on a promotion to try and really can say it made a big difference on the under eye puffiness I struggle with.  It also seems to reduce the appearance of the dark circles but I am not sure that is separate or just looks better with less puffiness so I will continue to use and report back in a few more weeks. Overall 2 thumbs up with very nice packaging and labeling.  A good amount for the price.</li>
    <li> I received this product at no cost to myself plus shipping in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;My most concerning skin problem is both under-eye circles and puffy under-eyes. Yes. Both.&lt;br /&gt;This product promises to solve both of those problems -in addition to a few others including lines and dry skin- as well as also be usable all over your face and make that smooth as well.&lt;br /&gt;It contains hyaluronic acid, aloe, and cucumber, all of which are known for skin treatment. It absolutely needs to be applied to a wet face. Water, toner, facial mist, anything. Otherwise it is drying, sticky, and tight. When applied to under eyes it remained tacky no matter what for me.&lt;br /&gt;Review:&lt;br /&gt;Cruelty Free: no mention was made of this...:(&lt;br /&gt;Package- this comes in a plastic bottle that feels homemade instead of mass produced. The label is a little crooked, the cap doesn&#x27;t fit so well...i like the thick pump that is hygenic and does not distribute too much.&lt;br /&gt;Scent: Cucumbers! I love this smell. It smells like cucumber and a little bit of aloe.&lt;br /&gt;Texture: smooth gel like a clear aloe, but feels tacky undereye and can peel when dry.&lt;br /&gt;Effect: smooth skin when properly hydrated prior, tacky and tight otherwise, always tacky on eye&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Some of the most popular and soothing ingredients together&lt;br /&gt;Summary: While it does make skin smooth when properly hydrated prior, and it smells great, and it&#x27;s cruelty free...it did not do a thing for either my dark circles or my puffy under eyes. And it is advertised as an eye gel. I will continue to use on my face and eye area until gone because I do like it as a facial product, but I just can&#x27;t recommend it for eyes because it did not do a thing to improve mine. I used it every day, twice a day, and in combination with toner or water.</li>
    <li> Just received my order yesterday. Smells wonderful, soft smell of clean cucumber.  Goes on smoothly, not sure how it works yet will update in several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for a month to give it a fair trial. I really wanted to like it, it has 3 times as much product as most other eye gels. Unfortunately for me it just didn&#x27;t keep the under eye area hydrated. Even worse it made the concealer I used over it dry out as well. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this agIn.</li>
    <li> lightweight (which I love) moisturizing (gotta love that) but I don&#x27;t know that I feel it&#x27;s exceptional in any other ways.  It does leave my skin soft, and ANY moisturizer is a positive thing, but I think that I like the Olay regenerating serum is very comparable.  This might be a little cheaper though!</li>
    <li> As a tired mother of 4 I need something to get rid of the dark circles.  These help reduce my tired look.  I have sensitive skin and these don&#x27;t bother it.  I&#x27;d recommend!</li>
    <li> As a full time college student my biggest problem are the dark circles under my eyes and I&#x27;ve tried several methods/creams to improve this.&lt;br /&gt;After trying this for two weeks, I can&#x27;t really say that it is the best eye cream I&#x27;ve had; however, I feel it did improve my dark circles somewhat and it wasn&#x27;t greasy which I liked. I don&#x27;t like feeling like my hands are sticky after putting on cream and this cream didn&#x27;t feel like that so that&#x27;s a thumbs up. The reason it&#x27;s 3 stars is because I wouldn&#x27;t pay the current price ($18.95) for the results I got. While it did help my dark circles and puffiness to some extent. I can&#x27;t really testify to it&#x27;s efficiency to solving fine lines and dry skin or helping at all with the saggy eyes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few months now and I love it.  My puffiness under my eyes is gone.  It really works.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for almost a year now.. works very well on my sensitive skin and leaves my eye area smooth and soft.. best eye product I have found to date, and believe me I&#x27;ve tried alot..</li>
    <li> I have noticed a world of difference in the brightness and tightness of my eyes with this product!</li>
    <li> Best eye cream! Beautiful and really effective!</li>
    <li> This eye gel is wonderful.  After using for a while, I am amazed at what it does for the eye area. Helps to reduce puffiness that we all hate.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Feels nice and cool to put on.  Don&#x27;t notice a big difference in dark circles and puffy eyes.</li>
    <li> seems to be a good product</li>
    <li> I like tis and it happens to get rid of puffiness instantly</li>
    <li> Light weight feels great and doesn&#x27;t break my skin out.</li>
    <li> I just got this today and I&#x27;ve used it once! It was packaged good, it came in fast! And it does look like the pic but its alot smaller then what I expected. Not saying it&#x27;s so terribly small that I&#x27;m angered I&#x27;m saying by the picture not paying attention to the size written it just shocked me smile but as for my first use, I like it, it makes my skin feel smooth, smell isn&#x27;t strong and alittle goes along way! As far as it making the wrinkles and dark circles under my eyes disappear idk yet in about two weeks I&#x27;ll come back and update my review to let everyone know if i recommend it but as far as shipping and packaging and the product itself my verdict is good!</li>
    <li> I look forward every day using Best eye cream for dark circles, Puffiness. I think it&#x27;s a great product. I would suggest other women would try it, as it does what it says. I am thankful I found this product on Amazon. I rate it an A.</li>
    <li> Tried it for over 2 months and problem is still there.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this much yet but It seems like it should work well.  I like how it goes on and there isn&#x27;t a strong fragerance like with some cremes.</li>
    <li> I have been using the VoilaVe Triple Vitamin C serum for about 6 months now, the product is nothing short of amazing.  I decided to try this product for my eyes.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been long enough (two weeks) but I&#x27;m staying on course to see results.  These products are inexpensive and do the job of skin care products 4 times the price.</li>
    <li> I have to say, being an old skeptic when it comes to beauty products that i am very impressed with this eye gel. After just a few short weeks of use I have seen a major reduction in puffiness and and wrinkles appear smoothed.It does not &amp;#34;pill&amp;#34; as many gels do when makeup is applied over it, which is a big plus as well. A little goes a long way and I have found myself using it over the rest of my face&lt;br /&gt;too and am beginning to see results there as well. I definitely intend to keep using this great product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eye gel.  There aren&#x27;t a whole lot of eye gels that I really have tried that I truly can say that I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, when we start getting older our body stops producing all that good stuff we need.  The thing I like about using this eye gel, I have always struggled with dark, I mean DARK purple circles and since I started using Eye Cream or gel it really has made a remarkable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent that this has, it&#x27;s a faint scent, but it smells SO wonderful, truly!!! It&#x27;s a natural product and so it&#x27;s a natural scent.  I&#x27;ve tried however, some &amp;#34;all natural products&amp;#34; in which they had either NO scent or a repugnant smell and that&#x27;s certainly not the case with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a review sample of this product.</li>
    <li> This works great for crepe under the eyes.  It&#x27;s a bit thick, and an clear gel that is slightly opaque.  It comes in a nice container with a pump dispenser that dispenses just enough for both of my eyes.  It is very easy to apply without having to tug my skin at all- it just glides on and is absorbed fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem with my skin under my eyes is crepe.  I don&#x27;t have any puffiness so I can&#x27;t comment on this product&#x27;s effectiveness for treating that.  It does a great job of plumping up the wrinkly crepe though, and it doesn&#x27;t cause any piling under my makeup.  That&#x27;s good, because I need this product a lot in the morning when the crepe seems the worst to me.  It works almost immediately- within seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product reminds me the most of Oz Naturals under-eye serum and is comparable.  Oz Naturals has nicer packaging, and it is priced about the same, but this brand is a lot larger size for the price.  I MUCH prefer this serum to other brands I&#x27;ve used recently, including Loreal, Neutrogenia, and the MUCH more expensive L-Aveu serum or the L-Aveu eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is 99% naturally derived, and it says 75% organic.  I really like it - it&#x27;s quite pleasurable to use, and rolls years off the skin under my eyes as soon as I put it on.  If you have problems with crepe and undereye thin dry skin, I do recommend you try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free sample provided for testing/evaluation and review.  Definitely one of the best eye serums that I have reviewed!</li>
    <li> I was contacted by VoilaVe to try out some of their natural beauty products. Once I saw what they offered I jumped at the chance to try their items out. I am always keeping my eyes looking for that perfect moisturizer. Although this is one of my favorites it did not win my five star approval. Read on to find out more!&lt;br /&gt;  VoilaVe&#x27;s Total Youth Eye Gel provides main care to the eye area. It is infused with Hyaluronic acid, Peptide Complex Blends, Plant Stem Cells, Matrixyl 3000, Jojoba Oil and Vitamin E. It is known to reduce wrinkles, dark circles and puffy eyes. Plus it reduces the appearance of wrinkles, helps boost collagen and restore elasticity to your whole face. VoilaVe&#x27;s Total Youth Eye Gel leaves your skin feeling firmer, younger and more beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;  As far as a daily moisturizer around the eye area,  I loved this. It is very lightweight and comes in a 1.7 fl. oz bottle and a little goes a long way. I like that it is all natural and leaves my skin naturally soft and not greasy.It is very non-irritating to my sensitive and dry skin. It also lasts for a long time I could feel my skin soft over six hours after application.&lt;br /&gt;  The only other disappointment I had with this is that it does not have any sunscreen or UV protection in it and that is always a bonus for me that I try to look for in my moisturizers especially because I wear moisturizers twice a day everyday.&lt;br /&gt;  The VoilaVe Total Youth Eye Gel is 99% Naturally derived/75% Organic which is actually very good for a moisturizing cream. The majority of the ingredients are oils, vitamins and organic herb blends. Next Generation Stay At Home Mom gives VoilaVe&#x27;s Total Youth Eye Gel 4 Stars. It is a great eye cream. I highly recommend it if you suffer from under eye circles, crows feet or puffy eyes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference after months of use.</li>
    <li> I really like the feel of this eye cream. Not irritating to my eyes, and no strong scent to irritate my sinuses. Can&#x27;t wait to see the progress</li>
    <li> Eye gel is now an essential product in my face care. I have dark bags under my eyes and this is a big help. It gives me a boost of confidence. I have used many brands of eye gel and this is up there with the best of them. And at such a good deal it is definitely worth giving this brand a try. It has some of my favorite ingredients: hyaluronic acid, matrixyl 3000, peptide complex, cucumber, and aloe</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few days on my skin and have already seen some improvement in fine lines! I feel a slight tingle when I first apply it, but it fades almost instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is pretty sensitive so I am always happy to find something that works that doesn&#x27;t give me a rash or itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for providing a sample for review on my blog.</li>
    <li> I have been using a C8 peptide complex for my eye areas and the lines on my forehead and between my eyebrows as well. I love the products I&#x27;ve been using and plan to continue to use it but the ingredient list for this is so appealing I had to get it. Like others have said you get a decent amount. The other product I use gives me .5 oz for around $40 so the amount you get from ViolaVe is more than worth it to try. Now I have started to use it and I love it! I love how it feels and I love how it makes my skin look. I will now just work both products into my regimen because I do feel like between the other product and this one my skin is getting an abundance of nourishment. I have pretty dark circles that I use mineral powder to conceal but I will report and lightning of the circles as I continue use. Also their customer service is above great. They have contacted me to ensure receipt and satisfaction and gave my contact info for any questions or concerns and they have an extensive product booklet available as well to explain the importance of their ingredients and skin care in general. Very impressed so far.</li>
    <li> Who has baggy eyes?  I think we have all dealt with them at one point or another from being tired or stressed, whatever the reason - VoilaVe has come up with a fabulous eye cream that will reduce those bags, tone and firm the skin around your eyes and the bottle will last you a LONG time.  You get 1.7 oz and you don&#x27;t need much at all - you just rub it in and in a few days you will start to see some results.  Those dark circles will get lighter and the puffiness will disappear.  This cream contains a lot of great ingredients such as Plant Stem Cells, Hyaluronic Acid, Matrixyl 3000, Cucumber, Peptide Complex, Cucumber and Aloe, all very well known to aid in skin repair and hydration.  I didn&#x27;t know this when I received it but you can use this on your whole face, it is NOT just for your eyes, and it comes with a 100% money back guarantee.  So you don&#x27;t have anything to lose by trying it except those bags, dark circles and a few years from your face!  I received a complimentary product to test :)</li>
    <li> This is working very well to reduce an area of skin on my face that is wrinkled for reasons unknown. I continue to apply it day and night as well as on other areas of my face and near my eyes. This stuff works.</li>
    <li> This is a great eye gel. It really helps with the swollen eye bags in the morning. My concealer goes on nicely afterwards. The whole eye area looks fresh and relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;The product also feels nice and cool after its applied.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Not only does it tighten up my skin and brighten it but it smells absolutely heavenly!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m seeing some results, but, not so impressed so far.</li>
    <li> So far, I really like this product!</li>
    <li> First of all I want to disclose that this was a complimentary sample from the manufacturer. Now, this is a HUGE amount of eye gel compared to other brands at a price that&#x27;s incredible. I feel a tingling/toning effect almost immediately with this product that indicates to me that it&#x27;s working on my skin. The cooling nature of these eye gels almost immediately begins to alleviate puffiness around the eyes.</li>
    <li> I like using this product as a full face mask I love the cucumber smell I haven&#x27;t noticed any results in my dark circles but the overall use  my skin seems brighter and healthier</li>
    <li> I tried the gel around my eyes and the rest of my face.  My eyes looked blood-shot the next morning and my skin on the rest of my face felt stiff.  I really can&#x27;t say that it improved that area at all.  However, sometimes a treatment may benefit another area.  So I will try it on my stressed hands and see if it helps.</li>
    <li> Wow, this works great for puffiness and fine lines. It doesn&#x27;t look like it did anything for dark circles, but it took away the wrinkles so I don&#x27;t care!</li>
    <li> I have always had trouble with under-eye bags due to severe allergies. Nothing has helped at all. I have used this gel now for 4 weeks, and must say I see a HUGE difference. I use it morning and night. After a good night&#x27;s sleep, my bags are usually gone in the morning. During particularly high-pollen seasons, if I awake with small bags under my eyes, I put some VoileVe on and within 1-2 hours the bags are gone.</li>
    <li> I found the gel to be quite sticky, even after ten minutes of a light application. My skin is in pretty good shape for 57, and this actually made the skin under my eyes appear to have deeper wrinkles where the gel stopped.</li>
    <li> This gel goes on so smoothly. I love the way it gently soaks in to the delicate skin around my eyes. I use it morning and night. It works well under make up or alone. This is my favorite eye cream of any I have tried. I have fine skin so having something waste rising but not heavy is important to me.  I have fine skin so having something waste rising but not heavy is important to me</li>
    <li> This is the best eye gel I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s a sort of &#x27;smooth &amp; freeze&#x27; effect.  I dab it in a circle around my eye, both upper and lower lids, and then smooth outward.  It works immediately, and is SO gentle.  It smoothes the &#x27;crepe paper&#x27; look of the upper lid, and flattens the puffiness of the lower lid.  I&#x27;m on my second dispenser!</li>
    <li> I have been using VoilaVe skincare line since about the middle of this year and have not been disappointed one bit!  I was recently asked to review their Total Youth Eye Gel, and let me tell you it could not of come at a better time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 33 years old, with three kids under the age of four and another one on the way which is due in March/April!  Needless to say I don&#x27;t get much sleep....ever.  Since the day my first child was born I can&#x27;t remember having a full night&#x27;s rest without waking up constantly in the middle of the night to take care of one of my children.  Nonetheless no matter what type of parent you are and no matter how much you do for your kids, nothing can get you back your years that you lose due to lack of sleep.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong I am use to working 14-16 hour shift as an intern and then as a therapist in my own practice. I know what its like to work 7 days a week around the clock,  sleep very little, eat very little and still look like you are in your twenties!  However all you need to do is become a parent to never sleep again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I naturally, by genetics, have dark under eye circles.  My two year old daughter has them as well.  Normally with dark under eye circles, very little besides surgery can really correct that issues.  However puffiness, dull eye skin, swelling, wrinkles and redness can totally be helped if a great eye cream is applied to the area.  However with that being said, not all eye creams actually do what they claim to do.  Most eye creams are great moisturizers.  However if you are looking to correct under eye issues, then you need more then just a cream to see a difference in that area.  You actually need a cream that is load with certain type of ingredients that are clinically proven to show results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VoilaVe Total Youth Eye Gel is made with organic ingredients and contains plant stem  cells, matrixyl 3000 to help tighten and firm the skin, hyaluronic acid to help plump out the skin and diminish the look of fine lines and wrinkles, cucumber and aloe to help smooth the skin and reduces puffiness and swelling, vitamin E; and other great ingredients to cause a difference underneath your eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is bottled in an air tight and non see through pump which is great to help keep the product stable and free from bacteria that is transferred from our fingers to the cream when we stick our hands in jars.  It dispense just the right amount with one pump.  A little goes a long way since your under eye area is small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product for about three weeks, and while it hasn&#x27;t been able to get me back my years of lost sleep (can&#x27;t have it all) it has been able to help reduce the swelling and puffiness around my eyes I get from water retention due to lack of sleep.  It has improved the looked of my starting crows feet around my eyes (gasp!!) and it has help plump out my skin and keep it conditioned and bright looking.  While my dark under eye circles will always exist, nonetheless lack of sleep just makes them look worse.  This under eye cream really has made a difference on eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am grateful to see a company that is able to offer an eye cream that does just more than condition the skin.  This cream is truly worth the try if you ask me!</li>
    <li> Made my eyes puffy. Received as free promo. Threw away.......</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple weeks now and notice a difference in the tightness of the skin under my eyes.  I have not really noticed a difference in color of dark circles.  Ill continue to apply daily and update this review if I see any changes in dark circles.  If you are looking for a product to help with under eye bags or sags, this works great!</li>
    <li> I did not get the results I had hoped for from this product. I cannot see any noticeable results, although I did enjoy the refreshing cooling I felt around my eyes when first applied. I would not recommend this product for older women with severe puffiness around the eyes.</li>
    <li> Looove this product! I use it with the rest of the VoilaVe line of products and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!</li>
    <li> My skin pretty much felt like I put half dry glue on it.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh, cucumber smell of this product but I don&#x27;t feel it gives me enough moisturizer for under my eyes.  It takes some time to get over the sticky feel initially when you put it on however, I do think it it&#x27;s improving the lines in the under-eye area.  I will continue to use it but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a week and it does seem to diminish the puffiness under my eyes.  I don&#x27;t have darkness, so I don&#x27;t know if it works for that, but it is non-irritating and does not burn.  It is a very large bottle and I only use a small dot to do both eyes under the brows and under the eyes.  It does not interfere with putting make-up over it in any way, which I like because I have used products that make the eye-shadow cake; however, this soaks in and is cooling as well.</li>
    <li> Worked ok, not a dramatic difference</li>
    <li> I like this eye cream.  It has helped with dark circles and is very moisturizing!  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Best eye gel ever!  It feels so cool and refreshing around the eyes and dries down quickly. It&#x27;s not a sticky gel nor a heavy eye gel that will intefere with your eye makeup, concealer, or foundation. Can&#x27;t wait for a few more weeks to see if the fine lines disappear.</li>
    <li> i HAVE SEEN IMPROVEMENT IN MY SKIN IN GENERAL</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised.  Great product.  Big bottle!</li>
    <li> I work very hard and me eyes are tired so frecuently and this gel IT&#x27;S FANTASTIC.</li>
    <li> Just got it in the mail. Tried it. Left my skin smooth. Will update once I&#x27;ve used it for a week or so to see if there are results</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything for dark circles</li>
    <li> I like it so far. At first I used a little too much,but once I figured out the right amount it works great. It does seem a little sticky but once it dries I reposition my under eyelid and I use my regular moisturizer and apply makeup. It stays put all day and it never shows under the makeup. I have only been using this for a week so I&#x27;m sure it is too soon to clear up the dark spots, but it works great for puffiness.</li>
    <li> It really works! I was previously using the product of a very well-known brand, and this product definitely is more effective. My eyes do not look that tired anymore (I am a graduate student that needs to work until late hours). I hope it will also be helpful in the long run.</li>
    <li> Does not work. Very drying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it one week but I have been impressed with the results. This product works.</li>
    <li> I received an email from the company thanking me for the purchase and to contact them with any questions. This impressed me. The product feels wonderful and goes a very long way and makes my skin feel very hydrated and soft. I have been using the product for about ten days and my skin is much softer. I have not seen a difference in wrinkles yet but think it will take a few more weeks until an honest assessment can be made but so far I really like this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried a number of eye creams in the last year since having my son, since not having enough sleep has a way of making your eyes look puffy, dark, and much older than one&#x27;s years. I have to say that this one stands out as having the most moisturizing, luxurious texture of all the brands I&#x27;ve tried. It makes my skin immediately look dewy, and that added moisture reflects the light and makes me look much more awake and put together then I did before putting the cream on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely impressed at how well this compares to eye creams from brands such as L&#x27;Occitane, Lush, and more. While those brands of cream seem to sit on my skin and not soak in, this cream is immediately effective and I have been very pleased to get to use it. While I received a sample for review, I plan to look into the rest of the line and purchase some coordinating products on my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using VoilaVe Total Youth Eye Gel for about a week I am seeing a slight difference under my eyes. My eyes feel more hydrated and less heavy and tired.</li>
    <li> I have tried another VoilaVe product and was shopping for a new eye cream.  I ordered, I received and I tried it.  I LOVE it.  The product smells great, a little cucumber-ish ( one of the natural ingredients) and is somewhere between a nice gel and cream (a gream!) The eye gel goes on smoothly and feels great.  I just tried it once, so I don&#x27;t know long term.  I recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for something that goes on smoothly and has some thought put into the formulation and manufacturing.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> I really like Voila Ve Eye  Gel Treatment. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the eye gel for some time and I notice quite a difference in the overall appearance of my eyes. I am in my 60&#x27;s so I don&#x27;t expect  a total transformation, but I am very pleased with the results. I am totally happy with all of the VoilaVe products and recommend them to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for less than a month and I do see positive results.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it for a couple of days and saw the puffiness return to my eyes, so I was say you need to use it&lt;br /&gt;everyday for optimal results. It has a slight pleasant smell of cucumber. A small dab goes a long.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with quality of product.&lt;br /&gt;I was given a discount on the purchase price for leaving a review of this product.</li>
    <li> I received this product in order to give my honest opinion.  I actually was impressed by this eye cream.  It is the best eye cream I have tried.  It really helps with my puffy eyes.  I put it on every morning and in the evenings before bed.  I can feel my skin getting tighter under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the cucumber smell, it is very refreshing.  It us much better than smelling like medicine.  Also, when you apply the cream, it gives you a nice cooling feel.  It is very refreshing.  I also like the fact that this cream is made of all natural ingredients.  The bottle is kind of small, and I was worried about that when ordering.  However, this is not an issue since you only need to use a very small amount each time to put under your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing this item again!</li>
    <li> I have only been using it for about three weeks.  I like the way my skin feels.  I use it on my face too.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I have had this cream about a week, and I can feel it tighten the skin under my eyes.  My eyes are very sensitive, and yet this gives me no itchiness or redness.  I am very excited about this product.  My boyfriend mentioned last night that I looked a lot younger, and I am soon to be 52!  So I would definitely try this product if you are looking for a younger appearance!</li>
    <li> This product - and the people who make/sell/stand behind it - is absolutely terrific! I have been using it for about 8 days and I definitely notice improvement in the dark circles and even the start of some eye wrinkle reduction (at least the appearance of, anyway). The cost was extremely reasonable (given all the very high priced eye creams on the market) so one is not running into a financial &#x27;brick wall&#x27; to give this a shot. I saw the stellar reviews it received on Amazon, so that was a big plus - and I added my voice to that today. The manufacturers/retailers have contacted me via email to make sure I received it and later, how it was working for me. Remember the days of &#x27;customer service&#x27;? This product is highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have dark circles but I do have puffiness;  I still have puffiness as it doesn&#x27;t seem to work for that particular problem. I understand that these bags are little pockets of fat. So I guess they just have to be cut out.  Dreadful prospect..</li>
    <li> This is the best thing ever for that little wrinkle between my eyebrows.  You know which one I&#x27;m talking about, because if you have kids you probably have this wrinkle too.  The one you get when you have to give the kids THE LOOK.  Yes, this gel reduces the Mean Mommy crease.  I love it, and you will too!  Makes me look much happier, and the kids think I&#x27;m less stressed out as a result. Totally worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I received this about a week ago and wanted to give it a chance to work before leaving a review. And this cream really works! I don&#x27;t get enough sleep and the bags are really bad under my eyes, but using the eye cream has so far shown a difference even after only a few days. i highly recommend this product to anyone with dark circles or puffiness under your eyes!</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this eye cream.  I have horrible dark circles constantly under my eyes from allergies.  After only using the cream for a week, I am already noticing them starting to lighten.  The gel isn&#x27;t really greasy and thick like other eye creams I have tried.  I am excited to see if there is continued improvement with continued use of the cream.</li>
    <li> The best eye cream for under make up I&#x27;ve ever tried. Not oily or heavy, did actually smooth out a few wrinkles. I use it both at night and in the morning.</li>
    <li> I have really seen a difference since using this product.</li>
    <li> Love it, I use it at night for the hole face, so refreshing and the bags and wrinkles are gone.</li>
    <li> My favorite eye cream I LOVE it😍</li>
    <li> It took a few days but I can see the difference in my puffy eyes in the morning and circles.  I can only say it works for me........</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast and the product works just as fast too. It&#x27;s light gel feels like it is working as soon as you put it on. Working midnights and now with spring allergies this product is a must! The company does a great job following up and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at a reduced cost to use and provide a review. I have noticed no positive difference using this product but Have noticed several negative ones. The product says it can be used all over the face however under my eyes and on my upper cheeks it dried my skin out terribly and caused me to breakout. I didn&#x27;t find it worth the reduced price, let alone the higher one.</li>
    <li> I first ordered this product in December and liked it so much and I will continue to use it.  Wife of Gary Z</li>
    <li> This product arrived super quick and packaged well. The bottle is super easy to use but disperses a little too much each push. Honestly - just a little will go a long way.  The product smells like cucumber and leaves a great cooling sensation after you apply it. For me it was a bit sticky after application but that was fine bc I only used it at night. I did see a reduction of the dark circles under my eyes within days of first use. I apply it to my forehead and laugh lines as well to achieve a more plump look in that area. I am highly satisfied with this product and would purchase from this business within a heart beat. They were great.</li>
    <li> I just received this gel and I like it already. I like the packaging which allows me to use just the right amount, which is a very small amount.  The gel is thick and smooth and absorbs quickly. Makeup goes over well. This gel removed the puffiness right away. Very nice.  I have high expectations for this product because Viola Ve products work well for me and because of the quality ingredients.  Completely natural and organic. I like this seller who back their products up with a 365-day hassle-free money back guarantee.  Bottled in the USA in an FDA approved factory.</li>
    <li> I like it so far, did sting a little bit when I first applied, but I do like so far!</li>
    <li> it smells really good. I can&#x27;t wait to see results and it&#x27;s a small bottle but a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This is the first product I have tried by VoilaVe and I like it.  It really helps with the puffiness in my underage area and is soothing and cooling and very easy to apply.  It leaves my skin soft and wears nice under my make up.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it leaves a little bit of a sticky residue on my skin, but it is nothing that is a deal breaker.  I like the product and the fact that it is completely organic and natural.  Sample provided for testing and evaluation.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye gel I have ever bought, and recommend it highly! It actually works, and out does the big names by far.</li>
    <li> I did not like it, saw no difference and made my undereye area sensitive.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. I want to tell you the entire story but you would think I was lying. Try it for yourself and see it is simply amazing.</li>
    <li> its doesnt work ,,for dark circle and eye bag.</li>
    <li> It does take care of some morning puffiness.  I cant tell yet about dark circles it&#x27;s too soon.  I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;m not having any allergic reactions to it, which is very important. Smells nice and I like the texture.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Amazing discounted price. Can&#x27;t wait to try this.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I think that it worked so well for me. I have thick dark purple circles under my eyes and short of putting on concealer every couple hours nothing seems to work. This really worked wonders for me!</li>
    <li> I love the soothing feel of the cucumber is this product, It feels great under my eyes. after a few days I can tell that the puffiness around my eyes has went down a lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and loved it!!</li>
    <li> Great for your eyes. So glad I have this product!</li>
    <li> I have dark circles under my eyes. No puffiness or bags. No wrinkles. I used this product for 5 days, twice a day and so far I haven&#x27;t seen any changes. I&#x27;m going to keep using it for another week or so to see if maybe I just haven&#x27;t given it a long enough time to work. The skin around my eyes does feel nice and supple, so I gave it 2 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a must buy! I like the way it leaves my eyes and skin feeling and looking. I highly recommend this product and to keep purchasing to keep your skin looking younger and firmer! Eye cream is important as this is a place where we use a lot, wear makeup and can easily buildup junk! This cream takes care of that when use normally. Get your eye cream from this supplier today!</li>
    <li> Love the wayit feels under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I love this eye gel.  I put it on both morning and night.  It&#x27;s light and not sticky at all.  I think it has helped my dark circles but it does very well for my puffy eyes as well.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream because it is not greasy.  It soaks in quickly and the whole eye area is smoother.</li>
    <li> I have really bad bags under my eyes that I always get told &amp;#34;You looked tired today&amp;#34;  After using this the first time, I was amazed how the bags were less visible.  I love how it smells like fresh cucumber but it is not overwhelming and it feels so refreshing when I put it under my eyes!  I just wish I knew about this years ago.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Goodbye puffy baggy eyes - This is some of the best stuff I&#x27;ve used (and I&#x27;ve used many types)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no scent, and the creamy-ness is -I think- the perfect consistency - not too thick so as to make one push hard into the face or eye, and not too runny so as to run down one&#x27;s face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to absorb quickly. Doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes.</li>
    <li> I swear my wrinkles or less noticeable, my daughter said my eyes look brighter.</li>
    <li> Have been using twice a day for a week  Didnt expect a miracle but have not seen any change in dark circles or puffiness.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is thick and milky and absorbs into the skin quickly, leaving it feeling silky.  It has a pleasant fragrance of fresh cucumbers with a hint of aloe vera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does an excellent job soothing and moisturizing the sensitive skin around the eyes and protecting it from loss of moisture.  Regular use will reduce the appearance of fine wrinkles and improve the texture of the skin.  I am also using it on some other areas with irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container holds 50 ml (1.7 oz.), which is about 70% more than many similar cosmetics.  The pump cap is easy to use and dispenses a large drop, which is just the right amount to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peptides included in the formula are being studied to determine if they can stimulate skin regeneration when applied topically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emagine Products provided eye cream for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Deionized Aqua (Water), Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Matrixyl 3000, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-3, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Globularia Cordifolia Callus Culture Extract (Plant Stem Cells), Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber Hydrosol), Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Silk Amino Acid Blend (Sodium L-Pyrrolidone Carboxylate, Sodium Lactate, L&#x27;Arginine, L-Aspartic Acid, L-Pyrrolidone Carboxylic Acid, Glycine, L-Alanine, L-Serine, L-Valine, L-Proline, L-threonine, L-Isoleucine, L-Histidine, L-Phenylalanine), Wildcrafted Vinca Major (Periwinkle), Organic Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice), Wildcrafted Euphrasia Officinalis (Eyebright), Wildcrafted Ganoderma Lucidum (Reishi), Organic Centella Asiatica (Gotu Kola), Boswellia Serrata (Frankincense), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Organic Centella Asiatica (Gotu Kola Extract), Organic Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail Plant Extract), Pelargonium Graveolens (Geranium Distillate), Organic Taraxacum Officinale (Dandelion Extract).ens (Geranium Distillate), Organic Taraxacum Officinale (Dandelion Extract).</li>
    <li> Very refreshing eye gel. Been using a week and see a small improvement.</li>
    <li> I have used the gel for approximately two weeks now.  I use it after I clean my face good, I apply it under my eyes and forehead.  I have notice that the fine lines are gone and the crows feet lines are much smaller.  The dark circle and bags I had under me eyes are diminished as well.  I add moisturizer and I can actually feel my skin tighten as the day goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to share this product with my Mom and other friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the opportunity to use VoilaVe Eye Gel this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Smells weird and is very sticky and gummy. Ick!</li>
    <li> Not sure why but this product gave me eczema around my eyes. This Made my skin appear more wrinkled ,swollen and itchy. All this gave me an eye infection. I stopped using, isolated and retried it. Unfortunately this product caused a SEVERE allergic reaction . So sad because I read reviews in several places that said it was excellent. Maybe this is a pirated product in a good package because the stuff I got really caused me problems. I really wanted to like this stuff but every time it touched the skin around my eyes it burned &amp; caused a bad reaction resulting in the need for a doctor visit.</li>
