### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>What an incredible product!!!</li>
      <li>Vita Liberta is the best option for self-tanning.</li>
      <li>He is very fair skinned.</li>
      <li>There are some great Youtube videos demonstrating this product.   </li>
      <li>I am so happy I bought this</li>
      <li>The product smelled very nice and wasn&#x27;t orange or streaky at all.</li>
      <li>smells nice too!</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>love this product!</li>
      <li>Which is upsetting because I wanted something I could put on and still have a nice color without waiting hours.  </li>
      <li>nice bronze color with a color guide for precision application.</li>
      <li>This is by far the very best self tanner I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Strong odor, washes off in the shower, transfers onto clothes and bedding, caused a rash...horrible product!  </li>
      <li>Exfoliated skin that has been moisterized holds the sunless tan so much better.</li>
      <li>excellent product, second time to purchase and will continue to purchase (lasts a while)</li>
      <li>and I plan to continue using it for sure.</li>
      <li>And I love it.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Its still better than getting skin damage</li>
      <li>Give me a super nice glow.</li>
      <li>I am naturally a fair skin tone and was really hoping this would work for me and thankfully it did.</li>
      <li>The product itself is fine, but the bottle has been opened before.</li>
      <li>Expected it to have awesome results but it works same at cheap Tanner from Walmart.</li>
      <li>But no where near what it claims... maybe if I had used it more than once I would have achieved the tan I wanted.</li>
      <li>Besides being darker, this product made my skin really soft and I have such a beautiful and natural glow.</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because it was the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So overall one of the better self tanners.</li>
      <li>Sure, I had some color, but it def wasn&#x27;t extreme and wasn&#x27;t worth what I paid for it.  </li>
      <li>I recommend applying this product with a tanning mitt or large dense, powder brush.</li>
      <li>so I really wanted to look tan and boy</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>But the idea of having to keep that sticky mess on my skin for 8 more hours was too much.</li>
      <li>There is much to learn about doing it properly and with the right tool (mitt or glove etc which do NOT come with the product).</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this.</li>
      <li>works well, but they didn&#x27;t send the mit to cover your hand that normally comes with it</li>
      <li>I got way better color results from St. Moritz which is like 75% less!  </li>
      <li>Just not dark enough to really notice much difference.</li>
      <li>only positive thing I can say about it is that it did develop evenly</li>
      <li>It looked really natural and it lasted about a week for me</li>
      <li>But I figured I would wait and see how it developed.  </li>
      <li>mean, it sure beats frying out in the sun</li>
      <li>I am naturally VERY pale so most tanners give me a lot of color..but to get a nice dark tan I would have to apply two or three layers of this, which is a big waste of product in my opinion.</li>
      <li>There were spots near my foot,hands and legs that were blotchy and extra orange.</li>

<li> There were spots near my foot,hands and legs that were blotchy and extra orange.</li>
<li> So I guess if you are not looking for something that gives you loads of instant and long term color, this could be what you are looking for.</li>
<li> I wish the color was a little deeper however it Doesn&#x27;t leave lines, no strong odor, doesn&#x27;t come off on clothes (as much as others).</li>
<li> I tried it last night for the first time and it was really sticky on me and kinda smelly :(</li>
<li> And the bottle says extreme nothing extreme about it... even after putting another coat on the next day.</li>
<li> but only for a few days...</li>
<li> I had a little color, but for this product being sold as &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t see any extreme color.</li>
<li> It also kinda seems like it slightly washes off.</li>
<li> I wasn&#x27;t very dark at all.  </li>
<li> The tanning guard wasn&#x27;t very dark or helpful.</li>
<li> When I put it on, I could hardly see the &amp;#34;color guard&amp;#34; which is a nude-ish color vs. a brown color which is what I had expected.  </li>
<li> The plastic seal is broken and there are a few little dots of dried tan on the outside of the bottle...</li>
<li> and I take a shower everyday.</li>
<li> Not sure.</li>
<li> I also recommend exfoliating your skin and moisturizing your skin at least 12 hours before application.</li>
<li> Sorry</li>
<li> and it doesn&#x27;t seem to fade splotchy like some products (St. Moritz does this unfortunately).  </li>
<li> AWFUL STICKY, STREAKY MESS.</li>
<li> It also got between the lines on my neck and of course darkened up and now my neck looks dirty :(</li>
<li> Really disappointed with this product.  </li>
<li> Was really disappointed</li>
<li> I was very disappointed after I tried this product...</li>
<li> Awful, really awful.</li>

    <li> Just used this and it worked! but only for a few days...because I shower every day. I guess some people dont shower every day so it might last a week for them.  There are some great Youtube videos demonstrating this product.   There is much to learn about doing it properly and with the right tool (mitt or glove etc which do NOT come with the product).</li>
    <li> Strong odor, washes off in the shower, transfers onto clothes and bedding, caused a rash...horrible product!  Vita Liberta is the best option for self-tanning.</li>
    <li> turned out orange and streaky, not brown at all.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd time I ordered this product. And I love it. Give me a super nice glow.</li>
    <li> Expected it to have awesome results but it works same at cheap Tanner from Walmart. Was really disappointed</li>
    <li> excellent product, second time to purchase and will continue to purchase (lasts a while)</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF ROCKS. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> What an incredible product!!! With one application, I was visibly darker. Besides being darker, this product made my skin really soft and I have such a beautiful and natural glow. I recommend applying this product with a tanning mitt or large dense, powder brush. I also recommend exfoliating your skin and moisturizing your skin at least 12 hours before application. Exfoliated skin that has been moisterized holds the sunless tan so much better. Love this!</li>
    <li> Go ahead and stop your search for a self tanner and just buy this stuff now. I bought it specifically for my sisters wedding. I am naturally a fair skin tone and was really hoping this would work for me and thankfully it did. My bridesmaid dress was backless so I really wanted to look tan and boy was I. It looked really natural and it lasted about a week for me and I take a shower everyday. I am so happy I bought this and I will continue to re-purchase!!</li>
    <li> I wish the color was a little deeper however it Doesn&#x27;t leave lines, no strong odor, doesn&#x27;t come off on clothes (as much as others). So overall one of the better self tanners.</li>
    <li> AWFUL STICKY, STREAKY MESS. This stuff gets everywhere. And you feel like you are covered in glue. The only reason it got 2 stars instead of one, is that it did give me some color. But no where near what it claims... maybe if I had used it more than once I would have achieved the tan I wanted. But the idea of having to keep that sticky mess on my skin for 8 more hours was too much. Also if you do buy this product (don&#x27;t) get the mit. Otherwise you will be so streaky. Awful, really awful. I had high hopes for this.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed after I tried this product... it didn&#x27;t foam out like it was suppose to left me sticky until washed off, I looked orange afterwards. Did not fade like a tanning bed tan. And the bottle says extreme nothing extreme about it... even after putting another coat on the next day.</li>
    <li> This is by far the very best self tanner I have ever used.  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Really disappointed with this product.  I&#x27;m returning.  I don&#x27;t know what is &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34; about this color.  When I put it on, I could hardly see the &amp;#34;color guard&amp;#34; which is a nude-ish color vs. a brown color which is what I had expected.  But I figured it would develop darker overnight.  Which is upsetting because I wanted something I could put on and still have a nice color without waiting hours.  But I figured I would wait and see how it developed.  I was equally as displeased.  I wasn&#x27;t very dark at all.  Sure, I had some color, but it def wasn&#x27;t extreme and wasn&#x27;t worth what I paid for it.  I got way better color results from St. Moritz which is like 75% less!  I recall one beauty guru saying she put on two layers when she uses it.  Sorry but why would I buy I product I need to do DOUBLE the work with?  I&#x27;m going to try something else...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only positive thing I can say about it is that it did develop evenly and it doesn&#x27;t seem to fade splotchy like some products (St. Moritz does this unfortunately).  So I guess if you are not looking for something that gives you loads of instant and long term color, this could be what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> The product itself is fine, but the bottle has been opened before. The plastic seal is broken and there are a few little dots of dried tan on the outside of the bottle... this is a bit of a worry.</li>
    <li> works well, but they didn&#x27;t send the mit to cover your hand that normally comes with it</li>
    <li> This was for my son. He is very fair skinned. This product did not make him look tan at all. He layered it and followed all instructions. He uses many different brands of fake tan. He will not be buying this one again.</li>
    <li> love this product! nice bronze color with a color guide for precision application. smells nice too!</li>
    <li> I tried it last night for the first time and it was really sticky on me and kinda smelly :( It also got between the lines on my neck and of course darkened up and now my neck looks dirty :( sigh The bottle says it smells like coconut and is non-sticky...maybe it&#x27;s just my body chemistry that doesn&#x27;t mix well with the product? Not sure. But that was my experience, anyone have the same issue?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, it sure beats frying out in the sun and I plan to continue using it for sure. Just wish it didn&#x27;t have this effect. Maybe it&#x27;s because it was the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK...so I tried it the second time, same issue, sticky and smelly and the next day, it actually doesn&#x27;t try all that even. There were spots near my foot,hands and legs that were blotchy and extra orange. It also kinda seems like it slightly washes off. Its still better than getting skin damage but yes, the smell is horrendous!</li>
    <li> I just applied this tanner last night. The tanning guard wasn&#x27;t very dark or helpful. When I woke up I could see some difference. I had a little color, but for this product being sold as &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t see any extreme color. I am naturally VERY pale so most tanners give me a lot of color..but to get a nice dark tan I would have to apply two or three layers of this, which is a big waste of product in my opinion. The product smelled very nice and wasn&#x27;t orange or streaky at all. Just not dark enough to really notice much difference. Probably won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
