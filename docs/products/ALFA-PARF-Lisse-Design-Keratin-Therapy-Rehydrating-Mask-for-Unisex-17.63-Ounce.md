    <li> I like this product very much - actually I like everything I&#x27;ve tried with this brand. If I leave the product on for at least five minutes before rinsing I can really tell a difference - I have thick hair with a tendency to curl or frizz with humidity. Product smooths the hair cuticle down and makes it feel healthier.</li>
    <li> The best hair product ever! Love it and so upset i didn&#x27;t know about it before. It makes your hair smooth as silk!</li>
    <li> Great item. my hair is like silk after this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about to purchase this for the 2nd time.. the first one lasted me 6 months! Granted I do have fine hair and I only use it on my ends as I have an oily scalp. That being said, you still get quite a lot of this amazing product and unlike most bottles where you see conditioner left but can&#x27;t reach the bottom, this jar is very wide so you can use every single bit of it until it&#x27;s completely done. Love it!</li>
    <li> Straightening is much easier now. Hair is smooth and looks not as frizzy before straightening. I defenitely recommend it. Reasonable price and will last me a long time.</li>

    <li> I like this product very much. Looks like it helps my hair to recover. Will have to continue longer to better see the result.</li>
