      <li>i do like it, its smell great, my only issue is that i don&#x27;t really feel clean!</li>
      <li>The sugar felt good on initial application - like it would scrub well -</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not bad tho</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because I like my sugar scrubs to be super abrasive (removing a layer of skin</li>

      <li>very moisturizing to my skin smells wonderful cheaper on other sites shipped quickly really worth trying the other scents and lotion</li>
      <li>It seems hard to find really good smelling grapefruit stuff</li>
      <li>It helps greatly with the extreme dry skin I get during the year, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily!</li>
      <li>but after about 5 seconds of scrubbing, the granules quickly dissolved and I was left just rubbing oil into my skin.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended</li>
      <li>The natural oils infused in the scrub leave your skin feeling supple and super smooth, and the fact that it&#x27;s a scrub cleanses your skin of any dead skin cells and leaves you feeling moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My only concern is that it is very oily, and requires cleaning the tub after use.</li>

    <li> I absolutely LOVE Deep Steep products! This sugar scrub is amazing and smells SO good. It helps greatly with the extreme dry skin I get during the year, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily!</li>
    <li> I love this product but I don&#x27;t care for the fragrance.</li>
    <li> love the smell use it often</li>
    <li> This scrub is amazing.  I thought for sure it was going to be a micro-granule scrub, but I was very wrong.  The scrub has good sized granules and feels great going on the skin.  It&#x27;s the perfect body scrub.  The natural oils infused in the scrub leave your skin feeling supple and super smooth, and the fact that it&#x27;s a scrub cleanses your skin of any dead skin cells and leaves you feeling moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also into using organic products, and this is by far one of the best and is priced very well.  It also smells great!!  Definitely recommend as a weekly body treatment!!</li>
    <li> Read good reviews and was excited to try this product. Sadly, I wasn&#x27;t very impressed. For me, its consistency and end-result wasn&#x27;t any better than any other &#x27;ol cheap store bought scrub. The sugar felt good on initial application - like it would scrub well - but after about 5 seconds of scrubbing, the granules quickly dissolved and I was left just rubbing oil into my skin. It did not feel exfoliating at all. This is probably the same for the other scents of this same scrub. I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This sugar scrub smells nice and is better suited as a facial scrub.  I liked the scent and it did some exfoliation.  However,  I found the product a bit creamy. It has plenty of moisturizer but leaves you feeling a bit greasy after your shower.  I may be a bit picky but I think the sugar grains could have been larger to increase exfoliation as a body scrub.  I will definitely continue to use it as a facial scrub but may search for a different one in the future. B</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite thing! Not as oily as other sugar scrubs, very good at exfoliation, makes my skin very soft, smells amazing.</li>
    <li> i do like it, its smell great, my only issue is that i don&#x27;t really feel clean! it&#x27;s not bad tho, i was just looking for a different feel afterwards</li>
    <li> The best sugar scrub I&#x27;ve used in a long time. The fragrance is light and pleasant. Not greasy like some scrubs.</li>
    <li> Definitely leaves your skin incredibably soft and unbelievable. Your face will never feel so clean and I love the grapefruit smell!</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I like my sugar scrubs to be super abrasive (removing a layer of skin tells me it&#x27;s working), but I did not enjoy this. It smells like Lemon Pledge and turns my shower into a Slip-n-Slide.</li>
    <li> I bought the 8 oz Gel but got the 8 oz jar instead.  The product is incredible.  It is very good at exfoliating and the oils leave your skin very soft.</li>
    <li> My favorite scrub ever!</li>
    <li> I like the way it makes my skin feel, but just a word of caution-it will leave your tub slick so be careful!</li>
    <li> The scent is heavenly and the product feels great on your skin!</li>
    <li> Amazing for dry skin in the winter!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite sugar scrubs to use ever. Deep Steep has the highest of quality ingredients and the scent is so up lifting. Is a wonderful scrub for the body yet gentle enough for the face. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> i love this stuff so much that i just ordered four more bottles to give away for christmas.  the sugar scrubs you and dissolves and creates a supple moisture barrier that is not greasy.  and it smells great w/out being too floral or too strong.  i love it and it&#x27;s not even expensive.  edit:  i just got 4 bottles of thsi for christmas gifts and every bottle was clogged and the sugar was settled and the scrub couldn&#x27;t be squeezed out.  with mine i had to cut it open and put the scrub in a jar.  the product is still fantastic but too bad the packaging is poor.</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  It seems hard to find really good smelling grapefruit stuff and this is a winner!</li>
    <li> very moisturizing to my skin smells wonderful cheaper on other sites shipped quickly really worth trying the other scents and lotion</li>
    <li> I got a supply of two scrubs in the mail. Instead of receiving the squeeze bottle as pictured in the product listing, I got two plastic containers with lids. Sadly they arrived leaking through the plastic wrap, having no protective seal over the contents. I think that the seller should post the exact container that will be shipped instead of this of the squeeze bottle. I was disappointed that my scrub melted and leaked and left me with less scrub. honestly the scrub is wonderful it made me feel great I just will have to find it locally or another merchant.</li>
    <li> love this product and I recommend it. Makes your skin very soft and smells wonderful and my face looks smoother and softer.</li>
    <li> Great scrub, worked perfectly and the scent was very relaxing.</li>
    <li> I found out about this and other natural products / cosmetics through this fantastic article on Urbanette Magazine, which lists the best natural / safe products, with their Amazon, EWG and GoodGuide ratings: [...]  Definitely worth reading!</li>
    <li> This is a super smelling product, and the sugary scrub works very well on knees, elbows. It is great aromatherapy in the morning and the smell lingers all day. My only concern is that it is very oily, and requires cleaning the tub after use. It is very good for moisturizing, but requires some post-use cleaning of the bathroom.</li>
