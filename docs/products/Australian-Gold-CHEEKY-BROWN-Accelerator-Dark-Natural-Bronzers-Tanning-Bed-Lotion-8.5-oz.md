<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells great and I have a great tan after only three 5 minute sessions on the tanning bed with the help of this lotion. Now I&#x27;m all set to not burn this summer :)</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works just great.  No streaking from the lotion.</li>
    <li> I love Australian Gold. It&#x27;s been around for years and it&#x27;s still as good as it always has been.</li>
    <li> For the price you&#x27;re not going to get another lotion that works like this.. Love it</li>
    <li> zzmy skin absorbs that lotion very well. It smells really nice too. However you will have to go tanning a lot to get satisfactory results.</li>
    <li> This product is GREAT!  I am a light skin tone and I used this twice now in a level 2 tanning bed.  The bronzer in it gives my skin the color I need that just tanning alone I can&#x27;t accomplish.  Also it is very inexpensive and goes along way.</li>
    <li> Let me preface my review by saying that I haven&#x27;t tanned in a bed in around 10 yrs. so I&#x27;m not too familiar with it. That being said I really loved this product. The smell is fantastic &amp; reminds of summer days lazing around on the river bar. It has a bit of color to it but it hasn&#x27;t darkened my palms or anything. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now, going to tan for about 3-4 times a week for nearly 2 weeks now (working my time up, I&#x27;m at 12 minutes in a level 2 now). I am noticing quite a bit of color change already and it&#x27;s a nice darkening of my natural skin tone, not at all orangey. This stuff isn&#x27;t super thick either so it seems like it should last for a while as well.</li>
    <li> Was good lotion,liked it.</li>
    <li> The smell is great. It is not sticky like some tanning lotions. I would buy this again and have already went through two bottles.</li>
    <li> This lotion absorbs quickly and is silky smooth.  The price is great and smells pretty good.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with Australian Gold Products. :)</li>
    <li> So far so good. Been using it about a month. Expected to be a little darker based on other reviews, but I&#x27;m getting there. May have to try something else and alternate. I love the way it feels though. Goes on smooth, not sticky and dries real fast. Smells great!</li>
    <li> I love the scent. Works great in a tanning salon. I enjoy looking at my brown legs now :)</li>
    <li> Very good tanning lotion</li>
    <li> Great smelling lotion and it works like no other. The bronzer is spot on and gets you a deep tan in no time. Truely a superior product.</li>
    <li> Price is great... Results not so much. Did not see much of a result from using this product. I used Cheeky Brown for about two weeks and didn&#x27;t notice much of an accelerated color. Probably will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! It smells great and works as good as the 60 dollar brands.</li>
    <li> Love it....definitely recommend for a darker tan very quick.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great and the price is too. This is really worth your money. Makes your tan very dark.</li>
    <li> would have preferred a different smell but the bronzer works well in this lotion.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion! It is  amazing and I use it in the tanning bed and during the few and far in between times that I have for tanning outside. Even outside this lotion shows great results, this is way better than any lotion that I have spent $30+ on. I will be buying more!</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t got a chance to use but this package came quickly and was sealed!! which made me feel better considering most the things i order from this website are NEVER sealed which makes me paranoid. im looking forward to using it!</li>
    <li> Nice smell and result on my skin. I use it in Moscow summer days and have a great looking&lt;br /&gt;tanned body.</li>
    <li> This lotion works great for me. It gives me a golden tan. Not greasy, goes on easy, and smells good to. I will order more of this product.</li>
    <li> Thanks For your help with this product i believe that it is a good idea buy with you i left my experience</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! I am fairly pale and got a sample packet of it first to try and fell in love with it! It smells great before and after tanning, and i don&#x27;t burn or hurt later from it, never have i experienced this before! I just tan. I do turn red, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt and fades to tan fast. Saved a lot by buying it online. Much better than the wal-mart products. Only negative its that it does leave a light greasy feel to you the rest of the day, but i think i&#x27;m just sensitive to that because i don&#x27;t like lotion, but would definitely recommend this product to anyone of pale skin that burns easily!</li>
    <li> Cheeky Brown just doesn&#x27;t have a cool name it helps you get that nice bronze god tan going too.  This works like the other Australian Gold accelerators but has a bronzer also to help you get a little base coat going.  Smells really good without being overpowering to yourself or others.  Absorbs like a really good lotion so no greasy feeling.  I havent used as much as the one with non bronzer, but it seems to work really well.</li>
    <li> The product is not as bronzing as I prefer, but this is an authentic product.</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time, and got results. Love it! Best lotion at such a great price, I&#x27;m not going with anything else.</li>
    <li> Should in great time,as told.Life made easy for. Great Job !!</li>
    <li> I have not purchased  this from this seller.  This is one of my favorite general bronzers.  It doesn&#x27;t have particularly long-lasting results.  I use it after tanning and showering and going out for the day.  It smells wonderful, moisturizes nicely and makes my skin look really good.  It is economical, so its effects won&#x27;t blow you away, but I love the stuff.  It is among my favorites.</li>
    <li> Awesome tanning lotion especially for the price.</li>
    <li> smells yummy. works good. goes on easy. gives a nice tint. I like this stuff. way better then those ones that cost 60+</li>
    <li> smells like pina colada</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for about 8 years now and have used this product for years. Let me start off by saying that the scent of this is wonderful! It smells like a combination of coconut and pineapple. This lotion will not make you super dark, but is a great accelerator. I usually use this when I first tan after a few months or weeks of not going to the tanning salon; it really speeds up the process and prepares you for getting a nice tan with another, more powerful lotion. For the inexpensive price, this is a great buy, especially for those who are \\&quot;beginners\\&quot; at indoor tanning. The lotion also goes on thin, is creamy, and will not leave you sticky post-session. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Australian Gold smell that only they can do! Gives a nice even tan with none of that tingling burning feel that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> Gave me the best tanning boost and bronzed color just in time for a wedding I was in! I recommend this for indoor tanning use!</li>
    <li> Amazing product very happy.</li>
    <li> like the way it smell .does tan me</li>
    <li> Love best stuff ever and so cheap I use the level four bed and I get a bit darker every time I use the bed with this stuff 😁😁😁</li>
    <li> Works&lt;br /&gt;Works as good as anything else I&#x27;ve tried even the $70-$80 stuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I prefer the (AUSTRALIAN GOLD TANNING ACCELERATOR LOTION 8.5 OZ) with the yellow top</li>
    <li> I love love love this lotion! Tans fast and lasts!! I actually use it as an outside tanning lotion! Highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Not enough bronzer for the more advanced tanner.  I also miss the tingle that more advanced bronzing lotions have.</li>
    <li> It has actually worked very well. Great product an very well priced. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a change in my color after tanning a week. I did like the smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for a couple weeks now uding this lotion..it is a great accelerator. I love how it is a bronzer as well, not to mention it smells amazing. The only downside is that once you put it on and get in the bed it has a slight sticky feel, but that wears off quickly and leaves your skin really soft with a beautiful bronze color..NOT ORANGE AT ALL!! Overall, this is a great lotion and I love it!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Works great and smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I used it under the natural sun. It Worked very well. I have yet to try it in the bed</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion for beginner tanners. Smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Gets you brown fast and smells great!</li>
    <li> Has a great smell and feels good on my skin. Made it feel soft. Would recommend this to everyone wanting a great and soft tan.</li>
    <li> It is supposed to have a good bronzing effect. I have not seen it so far. It smells like fruity bubble gum. I might purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell haven&#x27;t used it yet will use on vacation in Mexico. Can&#x27;t wait. 😁😊</li>
    <li> I actually like this lotion quite a bit. It doesn&#x27;t feel gross on the skin. It smells really good also!! It seems to work quite nicely too. I&#x27;ve gone through most of one bottle and I&#x27;ve never had any strange blotchy spots, plus I&#x27;ve not gotten burnt at all.</li>
    <li> Great lotion!  Smells good.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It really makes a difference in tanning. I have very sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that I can use but this has been perfect for me. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get to use this accelerator very much so I can&#x27;t be honest and review it very much.  What little bit I did, it seemed to do what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> Quick arrival, smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Got hives using this.</li>
    <li> This was expired. I still tan the same as I do if I wasn&#x27;t wearing this lotion! It&#x27;s runny and doesn&#x27;t go on smooth.....</li>
    <li> It is exactly as i expected.  Love the scent and it seems to be working really good.</li>
    <li> This lotion is decent. I&#x27;ve used lotions that got me darker, but I do suggest this one to get started with if you&#x27;re a first time tanner.</li>
    <li> Australian Gold is always a very good product, love this one also!</li>
    <li> Great stuff helped me to get a great base fast!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion because it tans quickly in the tanning salon and I can use it outside as well.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great, the smell is great and goes on really smooth.</li>
    <li> Used for 2 weeks straight out in the sun for 6 hrs no tanner</li>
    <li> ive used many different brands of tanning lotions, from designer skin to banana boat, and i always end up coming back to Australian Gold products. this lotion is absolutley amazing. i used it outside and had a nice color in a small amount of time. it didnt leave a bad smell after for me, smelled kind of like berries. it rubs in well and its not a thick nor runny, its perfect for me. shipping was fast, i recieved this 4 days before the expected delivery date. overall everything was great and i would recommend this to friends and family!</li>
    <li> Wife loves the coloring she gets using this. Smells wonderful and makes the tanning feel less intense on her skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion gives me a nice brown color. It smells great too.</li>
    <li> Product as is promised. My tan is darker and richer brown in a shorter time. I really like the smell , too. The lotion applies easily and does not sweat right off.</li>
    <li> I first tried Cheeky Brown when I was in highschool. It was my favorite! I bought it more then once and developed a beautiful goldon brown tan.&lt;br /&gt;Cheeky Brown smells DELICIOUS! It also feels so hydrating and it glides right on your skin. A little bit goes a long way with this lotion, and you really cannot beat the price!&lt;br /&gt;You get your moneys worth with Australian Gold Cheeky Brown.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this ! Have been tanning for almost a month now and I&#x27;ve gotten a brown color as opposed to orAnge ! People who spend more than 20 for a tanning lotion are out of their minds ! This product is great !</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this because of the reviews I had read about it, however I do not think that I got the lotion that everyone else was talking about. I was immediately skeptical when I got the package- there was a piece of scotch tape over the lid of the bottle!! No seal or anything..thats when you know something is up!! As for the tan, I think I tan better without this lotion. I saw no difference what so ever. This was a waste of money, and a waste of time. I definitely would not recommend this to anybody. Ever.</li>
    <li> I am the girl that spends $60 on a bottle of lotion, realizes it does nothing, and gives it away.  So I bought this Cheeky Brown on sale for $9.20 the other day since I have Prime shipping.  I have gone to the tanning bed two times (sunday and monday).  I lay in the 15 minute beds and have laid twice for 8 minutes.  I am BROWN and I burn really easily.  I normally go out to the beach on the weekends coated in SPF 30 and still get burned bad after 2 hours.  For the size and the money I will most def be purchasing again!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product tons in the post only I bought it from my salon. The price difference is only 11 dollars and the bottle came taped as if it had been used. This is probably the first and last time I buy lotion online as it in addition to being taped didn&#x27;t smell right</li>
    <li> For the price, this stuff is really great. I needed some lotion to tan with because I am fair and I desperately wanted to get a little color before going on a trip to Mexico in May. I didn&#x27;t want to pay $50 for lotion when I wasn&#x27;t really planning on consistently tanning for a long period of time. I read reviews on Amazon and decided to go with this. It has done it&#x27;s job, smells decent, and it&#x27;s greasy. I&#x27;d recommend for sure.</li>
    <li> Used it this weekend and worked great, beware however it will burn you!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this lotion. Bronzers provide a nice tan, no red!</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion did what the label says! Brown you! Its smell is like a tropical cocunut smell...love it! Not too over powering either. I used it while i was on vacation in mexico and laid out in the sun for long periods of time and the results came out to be a little darker than i expected! Haha i am of medium skin compkexion so i dont need much hours out in the sun to get that tanned color. I would recommed to wear sunscreen if you wearing it as an outdoor lotion as it has no spf at all and you might get burned. Havent tried it at the tanning salon but im sure it works great too!</li>
    <li> I got this lotion to increase my tanning before my wedding! It was great, love the smell, I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> I have been using this off and on for years and it always works great. Thanks for getting it to me so quickly.</li>
    <li> Used about 12 times...tanner then I was but didn&#x27;t get very dark. I am fair skinned and don&#x27;t tan easily but I did get some color. I didn&#x27;t turn orange so that was good thing and the lotion didn&#x27;t have a weird smell. So overall I like the product and will continue to use it for now.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for my mom, since she was paying $5 a packet at the salon every time! I had to try the lotion out before I gave it to her lol...And it is great! I ended up ordering myself a bottle afterwards. I always buy my lotions on Amazon, and never had a bad experience. Beats the salon prices! And this has a nice fruity smell, it goes on smooth while not greasy, and the bronzer is great. And with this lotion, I don&#x27;t have that bad after-tan smell. By far one of my favorite lotions!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m somewhat fair skinned and always seem to have a red tinge to me.  Not with this lotion.  Brown as a berry and no burn!</li>
    <li> This product gives a good result and doesn&#x27;t take a lot per application.  I would recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these they were quick to get them to me actually faster than I thought love these lotion so will definatly will be buying again</li>
    <li> Australian gold is always a good accelerator when you first start tanning.</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve had yet! Tan stays long and leaves a great smell!</li>
    <li> If this is your first time buying tanning lotion, I would suggest this lotion solely because of the cost. It does moisturize well! However I can&#x27;t say I notice any of the accelerator or bronzing affects of this lotion. Other reviews are correct in that it does smell like bubble gum. This is horrible if like me, you hate the smell of bubblegum. Unfortunately it also lingers for a few hours making a trip to the salon during lunch breaks an impossibility. My suggestion is too pay a little more and get something that actually helps your tan.</li>
    <li> love the smell and it works great. 2nd time i purchase this item!</li>
    <li> Worked well As a tanning bed starter</li>
    <li> Great product for the price! Smells awesome and you don&#x27;t smell like burnt skin from tanning! Great color!</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t make my tan last indoors as much as I would have liked. I&#x27;m not complaining because it gave a nice color but it didn&#x27;t last too long. I will be using this for the outdoors in the summer instead and purchasing a different indoor lotion.</li>
    <li> Used this everyday as an outdoor tanning lotion under or over my sunscreen on my Hawaiian vacation and came home with the most beautiful dark brown tan. It is relatively thin and easy to rub in with a light pleasant scent. Tons of compliments from people who have seen the results!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Lasts forever.. Smells awesome to</li>
    <li> works great smells great</li>
    <li> I Love the smell. I Love the results! Australian Gold always meets my expectations. Delivered very quickly as well even with the holiday</li>
    <li> Add a little moisture and color to you skin, keep your skin fully hydrated I enjoy Australian Gold products I am very fussy with my skin all over for head to toe. Smile take good care of yourself.</li>
    <li> I was using another indoor lotion &amp; hadn&#x27;t really gotten very dark. I noticed a difference the first day I used this! Within 3 appts I was twice as dark! And it smells great!</li>
    <li> Love It!  Have bought it twice now and will def buy again.</li>
    <li> Works great and smells like candy!</li>
    <li> this is a great product! smells good (kinda fruity/coconuty), decent price, the bronzers work very well and it gives me a great tan! i am fair skinned and started using this after i hadn&#x27;t been tanning for a while, it gave me color within the 1st few sessions which was great.  this probably isn&#x27;t going to get you super dark so i wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for experienced tanners but its perfect for a fair skinned person such as myself!</li>
    <li> I was expecting to get a little darker from this but it did give me a good base fan to move up from ! I just purchased designer skin black !</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even know where to start.  Darker then a Brazilian beauty. Came within 2 days of order and I&#x27;m quite a dish actually and feel ready for summer and the scent is fruity and beautiful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent way more $ on indoor tanning bronzers with not a good result.  If you buy this lotion you will NEVER buy anything else. Awesome product!  Buy it! By my third session I was noticeably darker and it smells great.</li>
    <li> Came on time, no problems. My wife has been using this for a while, never turned her orange. It won&#x27;t turn you tan instantly but it does work! She goes a couple times a week and has a nice tan going. It doesn&#x27;t stink like most tanning lotions I have smelled on her after she has gone tanning. It also makes her skin soft and smooth, healthier feeling. She would recommend to anyone who is looking for a boost in their tan and get the most out of their money and time.</li>
    <li> Great product. No streaking and great smell.</li>
    <li> It was just ok.  Nothing to write home about.</li>
    <li> Smells very tropical and lathers on very nicely. I love this brand and will continue to purchase more products from them&lt;br /&gt;I use it for indoor and outdoor tanning!</li>
    <li> It seems to be taking longer for me to reach color in tanning bed.</li>
    <li> Came in quick and for the price was a good product, but the bronzer could be a little bit more powerful cause it took awhile to get some color.</li>
    <li> This worked great on my usually hard to tan skin.</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing accelerator I&#x27;ve ever used. It is getting me color fast and you can&#x27;t beat the price anywhere!</li>
    <li> Smells good and works like a charm. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Shipped on time! Great product for a nice glow!</li>
    <li> Works great gives you a great color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worked at a tanning salon for about 3 and a half years, and I have to admit, this is one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve used the white Kardashian intensifier, Ed Hardy Faux Heat, Snooki Skinny, JWoww black bronzer, etc., (all pretty pricey) and none work as well/smell as well as this one. The others feel very unnatural and smell very strong and gross. This one is very light, yet extremely effective, and smells wonderful. Not to mention its amazing price! Also, i used it at the beach this past week and my skin is as dark as its ever been. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times but I love it.  I have rather pale skin red hair and freckles and after using just 3 times I have some color.  Not much but I can tell there&#x27;s a change.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Irish and somewhat fair-skinned with freckles. If I don&#x27;t pace myself I&#x27;ll burn, but generally speaking I don&#x27;t have too limit myself too much. I start out laying in the sun using between 4 or 8 SPF while I get my base tan, then switch to accelerators to get dark. I took this same approach with the beds, first usings the AG tanning lotion with 6 SPF. From there, I switched to this one, the AG Cheeky Brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, don&#x27;t expect to get extremely dark with this. It took me about two weeks of using up to 5 times each week before I felt like I had a quality base tan. The bronzers in Cheeky Brown aren&#x27;t quite as dark as what I was expecting, but for the amount of color that I had I feel like the Cheeky Brown was a good stepping stone. I&#x27;ve just recently switched over to the [[ASIN:B00T38KPEQ Australian Gold Deviously Black 45X Dark Bronzer Indoor Tanning Bed Lotion 8.5 Oz/ 250 Ml]] and am tanning a bit faster now. I also feel like I get significantly hotter while I&#x27;m tanning with the Deviously Black, which is understandable as it&#x27;s much stronger than the Cheeky Brown. I did really like the Cheeky Brown, but it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d continue to use throughout the season. It&#x27;s one I&#x27;d say is most appropriate for someone who needs to get a base tan, for which it&#x27;s a great stepping stone for the first round of color.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!  NORMALLY I ONLY USE JWOW BRONZE AND TINGLE I AM A SERIOUS TANNER SO I ONLY WANT THE BEST,  BUT THIS STUFF IT&#x27;S GREAT FOR HALF THE PRICE!!  PACKAGE WAS ORDERED ON A FRIDAY WE&#x27;D AT MY HOUSE ON MONDAY AND IT TASKS NEW GREAT AND HAS AWESOME SMELL I RECOMMEND IT ANY DAY</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel this did anything but work like a regular lotion. I wasn&#x27;t real happy with the smell eirther.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;The results are not as dramatic as other products on the market but at least it smells nice.</li>
    <li> Best lotion all around, smells good and no odd colors or stains from using. Shipped fast.</li>
    <li> Love this , it is wonderful, Leaves glowing skin color :)</li>
    <li> As a Bronzer: I usually avoid using lotions with bronzer because I don&#x27;t have the patience to correct streaking and all that jazz. I actually accidentally bought this, not realizing it had a bronzer in it, but I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. The bronzing action is on the light side, so if you&#x27;re already dark, it isn&#x27;t going to make a noticeable difference on your skin, but because it&#x27;s light, it is also forgiving. When I started using this, I was pasty and the bronzer showed up, giving my skin a sunkissed look without it looking fake or uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a Tanning Lotion: It&#x27;s mediocre. For the price, it is great, but there are certainly better lotions out there. Of course, if you are looking at buying this, you&#x27;re probably more concerned with saving money than getting a super deep tan. This is my second Australian Gold tanning product, and I&#x27;ve almost finished the bottle. I used this when I was working on my base tan, and it was great for that purpose, but I&#x27;ve kind of plateaued now and this lotion isn&#x27;t doing anything to help me out now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: If you are super pale and trying to get a base tan going with a little instant color action, this is great, and if you really don&#x27;t want the bronzer, AG also has an accelerator that is safe for indoor and outdoor use that is pretty much the same thing without the bronzer. If you already have a base tan, I suggest going with something with a little more &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; like a tingling lotion or one with an intensifier (I used AG&#x27;s intensifier last time I tanned and it definitely did the job).</li>
    <li> Nothing fantastic. Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my tanning. The smell is good but that&#x27;s not what I buy the lotion for. Probably won&#x27;t buy this one again</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is good.  When I slather a lot on before indoor tanning, it works really well - but you really have to use a lot each time to notice the difference.  The smell is great too - sort of bubblegum-ish.  I haven&#x27;t really tried many others but it&#x27;s not bad - but nothing extraordinary.  The best thing about this product is the price.</li>
    <li> Works great and great price!</li>
    <li> As an expirenced tanner, I feel this lotion works great, has a nice sent and gives a good color with no streaking or staining your hands.</li>
    <li> I have bought this stuff at a salon and when I figured out you can buy it on Amazon for much cheaper I decided to do it. It&#x27;s the exact same lotion as you buy at the salon. Gives skin great color and smells great too. You get a lot for your money.</li>
    <li> Always great results in the tanning bed or in the sun with this lotion.  And even when you can&#x27;t get your tan on that day, the slight bronzer in this lotion gives you a nice little glow.  Yummy scent, light, non-greasy or tacky. . .goes on smooth and even. . .can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> Came as described, but I have used other lotions and this one helped the least. I guess you get what you pay for. Though the smell is nice.</li>
    <li> I have used many Australian Gold products but this is my first time using this one. I love the AG fruity/fresh smell. I have not tanned since summer (in the sun) so I am using this to get a base tan. I love that it is an accelerator and bronzer. It has really help me get tan fairly quickly just as it is supposed to do. I am able to use it on my face without any reactions or breakouts (and I have sensitive skin). The order arrived fast and in a shrink-wrapped plastic pack. I am very satisfied--my hubby is using this as well for a base tan and is having great results.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, keeps my skin moist outside or inside. Arrived on time and packaged well!</li>
    <li> Quick shipping,works great</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great!</li>
    <li> I have ALWAYS used this tanning lotion, and no matter what I have color within the first 2 weeks. I have tried other tanning lotion products and there is nothing like this one.</li>
    <li> Some of the best AG lotion I have ever used.  The smell is mild and pleasant, the bronzing is mild (I don&#x27;t care for a bronzing effect), and it works great.  I ordered three bottles and will likely order again before the summer in Spain is over.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Its just okay...doesn&#x27;t do much</li>
    <li> Sticky hands a little streaky</li>
    <li> Very little bronzer, no tingle, GREAT for someone who is pale or is just starting indoor tanning</li>
    <li> wonderful tanning lotion with pleasant odor</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I expected more than I got. It&#x27;s an okay product for the price...it smells good but it leaves more of an orange tan than a bronze one. I use it when I&#x27;m going in my cheap bed and I use my black one when I&#x27;m in the upgraded beds.</li>
    <li> Not bad for starting your tan, but much better at maintaining it as it contains a low-level bronzer and an excellent accelerator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is a bit fruity (berries), and does not go &amp;#34;burnt&amp;#34; smelling after tanning.  The fragrance lingers as a light berry scent for hours, and is quite pleasant for men or women, but probably better suited for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this with my first tanning session of the season, and it did start my tan, but only started it...  After 3-4 sessions with the Australian Gold Sinfully Black 15X Bronzer, this accelerator truly shined as it can now maintain my tan week-to-week with only 10 min sessions.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance and it is very affordable.  No need to spend extra dollars on indoor tanning lotions because this one does the trick!</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion. For the price, it does a great job!! I went from using just generic/drugstore brand tanning lotions, because I don&#x27;t see any sense in spending a fortune on high end lotions at the salon, to using this and it has made such a difference. I am darker, and feel like my tan lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife. She loves Australian Gold products and had not tried this one before. She was very happy with the results. Would buy it again for sure. Good price and fast shipping as well.</li>
    <li> Received promptly. Experienced no spotting on skin as we have with others. Nice fragrance and tan color. Will purchase again. Excellent price compared to others</li>
    <li> I know nothing about tanning. This product is cheap and seems to work well. I don&#x27;t notice the lotion doing anything to my legs. I&#x27;ve googled &amp;#34;lack of tan on legs&amp;#34; and it seems the legs are tough to tan in general.</li>
    <li> I am an extremely pale person. I mean, I get stopped sometimes for people commenting on how pale I am. Being pale means when I&#x27;m out in the sun trying to get a tan I turn cherry red. That is until this stuff! I put this on and lay out in the sun and I get tan so much faster! It smells sweet, which I&#x27;m not too much of a fan of but it&#x27;s not overwhelming and it doesn&#x27;t clog my skin on my body. Will purchase again and again!</li>
    <li> The salons way overcharge for the same product, I saved 75%! Love how they smell and they produce a killer tan!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Really satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> Works great for a frequent tanner. Smells good too! Doesn&#x27;t stain clothes either.</li>
    <li> Smells like like nasty orange dreamsicle</li>
    <li> Made me so dark but i&#x27;m afraid it may have stained my skin. Smells delicious and i did love the product, though once you start using it, you stop using sunscreen. Please wear sunscreen guys!</li>
    <li> Works good, not too greasy and stays on throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Classic! You will love everything about this product, the bronzer is awesome. I like to tan with this lotion when I&#x27;m going somewhere afterwards. But as with any bronzer wearing white and then getting mad it rubbed off is silly. Well duh! I get good color with this.</li>
    <li> I keep using this, and really am not seeing any results. I&#x27;m really, really pale, so maybe it&#x27;s going to take more time, but I thought I would see some results by now? Also it smells like bubble gum.</li>
    <li> My Russian girlfriend, who likes to spend my money, says it is good. I don&#x27;t know, because she is using it, and she is too busy to tell me anything other than she likes it. She&#x27;s off right now as I write this spending more of my money. Since she is a princess, and only likes expensive things that are good, I assume it is good. Can&#x27;t say much else about the product, other than my girlfriend, who was thinking of new ways to spend my money right now, approves, which means you are probably okay getting this.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great. It smells amazing and it&#x27;s versatile. It can be used as both an indoor and outdoor lotion. I definately got better results when I used it outdoors, and I even used spf15 lotion with it. It still gave me good color. Indoors it definately helps accelerate your tan, and I did notice a difference after the first use. It has a really plesant smell. I would say its sort of a lemony smell. Not my favorite tanning lotion smell, but it doesnt smell bad. Overall its a great product. I have had nothing, but great experiences with Australian  Gold products and always use both their indoor and outdoor products all the time.</li>
    <li> This works very quickly. I am not extremely pale, but I am not tan either. A normal, white skin tone. I put this on and laid outside for half an hour in the side and was noticeably more tan. I use this about once a week for 30-45 minutes and I am tanner than most people. People tell me how tan I am.</li>
    <li> Produt provides great color to fair-skinned people like myself without looking fake. I would highly recommend this. Never had a tan last so long in my life!</li>
    <li> This smells great and does work well for a steady tan. I used it in the tanning bed and look forward to ordering more after my pregnancy. I had given it to a friend to use so it wouldn&#x27;t sit. She likes it, too and she&#x27;s more of a regular tanner!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years &amp; it always helps me enhance my tan. It&#x27;s great for outdoor tanning as well as tanning salons. It smells nice also. I&#x27;ve had no problem with it staining my hands or swimsuit. I do let it dry/soak in before laying out.</li>
    <li> Okay but not fabulous. For the price, it smells good and helps you get darker. If you don&#x27;t like the smell of bubblegum, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Definitely helped to get my base tan going :) I&#x27;m a bit dark for being so pasty!!</li>
    <li> Great product for the money.  At the tannings salons, it is triple the amount.(huge mark up)  Go figure.</li>
    <li> works as expected.  need to order more</li>
    <li> This one works well as do all their products......AND! At a great price!</li>
    <li> Going to Florida. i am going to tan before I go because  I am fare right now,  i usually tan really great, The lotion smells wonderful,  I tanned once and was a shade darker,  i recommend this product,</li>
    <li> Mother ordered it, and has since gotten more. she loves it and wont tan without it</li>
    <li> Another first rate product from Australian Gold. Great texture and aroma. If you like lotions that have bronzers, this is another one to order. Will reorder in the future.</li>
    <li> The smell is pleasant and not too strong.  I tan easily so I am only using a tanning both for upcoming wedding.. I think it leaves a nice bronzed look.</li>
    <li> Not only does it smell super amazing...like starburst, it goes on like lotion. Like actual lotion...not sunscreen, tanning lotion, oil...lotion. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t sweat off and feel gross and gooey. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I read reviews before I bought it. It does give you a nice tan and I apply it right before I go tanning,meaning I can&#x60;t wash my hands. To my surprise, my hands did not turn orange. I was worried about the smell, but honestly I didn&#x60;t think it smelled that bad. I will buy again. love it.</li>
    <li> well nothing bad to say about anything from australian gold, especially with this product. great smell and adds color immediately.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cheeky Brown for the past 6 years, it&#x27;s the only lotion I buy.  I&#x27;m fair skinned with light brown hair and blue eyes - I don&#x27;t tan darkly.  This lotion gives you a glowing brown skin that doesn&#x27;t look fake or orange.  It smells great, too, unlike other lotions I&#x27;ve smelled (not very fruity or candy).  Also, the lotion has aloe and has no mineral oil, which can make your skin dry out and crackly.  Finally, I love that I can use this in the sun, too;  I get more use from it.  SAVE MONEY BY BUYING ONLINE ... salons charge up to $25.00 a bottle.</li>
    <li> This product was a couple of years old and from what I have researched causes the ingredients to not be as potent.  Didn&#x27;t really work and I am VERY fair, but it did smell wonderful - like bubblegum.</li>
    <li> I only have tanned 4 times.. SO dark already! LOVE this stuff. Have never seen such great results from another tanning lotion. And I love the smell. Smells like summer :)</li>
    <li> After buying this product, and seeing how well it works and how silky the application is...I feel incedibly stupid for ever buying an overpriced lotion from a tanning salon.</li>
    <li> Affordable and it works. Australian Gold has an excellent reputation for all of their products. Very little fragrance, no overpowering smells.</li>
    <li> I love this brand, especially the smell. Also, I like the fact that 1. It&#x27;s not too oily (I can get it off of my hands without soap and water) 2.its not bronzing so that I don&#x27;t have uneven patches where I missed. Just a good old fashioned tanning lotion that always does the job!</li>
    <li> my wife says she loves it</li>
    <li> Love the smell works great shipped fast and GREAT PRICE 💜💜💜</li>
    <li> Burned me pretty bad, every time I&#x27;ve used it. I go for 5 mins. ,  so I talked to a few people,  they told me to find a product that has aloe as the first ingredient. Btw, I am a white Irish red head. So you can imagine how white my skin is.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! I&#x27;ve always spent too much money on tanning lotions and they don&#x27;t even compare to this stuff! Great price and great service. Got my lotion earlier than expected. There is a scent to this stuff but I don&#x27;t mind it at all and it seems to fade pretty soon after tanning. Definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> Tanning lotions usually turn me away because of the smell, but I believe this one smells pretty good. More like a sharp tropical smell. Seems to be working pretty great too.</li>
    <li> very good tanning lotion. within a couple of sessions in the tanning bed had a very nice start of a tan.  will be buying again</li>
    <li> I got this for my Mom and she likes it. Smells like Orange and Vanilla. she is also getting some good color.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.  I&#x27;m never disappointed with Australian Gold products.  I only go to tanning bed once a week, and I&#x27;m med-fair naturally, just wanted a little color.  This gave me a nice brown color, without having to try very hard and great price, especially compared to the prices at the salon.  Still only going once a week.</li>
    <li> The tanning lotion itself works okay but when I received it the lid had opened and half the product had spilled out. Not really worth the time/effort to send it back.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used it for years... I don&#x27;t burn and I took it to cancun with me and got the perfect tan.. I love it</li>
    <li> a very good product a nice smell</li>
    <li> This lotion smells absolutely amazing.  However, it isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I thought it would be.  A little however does go a long way.</li>
    <li> First tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried and it&#x27;s great! Smells like oranges, and goes on like lotion. I love that it does NOT just sit on your skin and you feel icky.&lt;br /&gt;I use this for outdoor tanning, fifteen minutes each, and I&#x27;ve already got a tan after a few days!</li>
    <li> This took my tan from meh to pow in three sessions! Works ultra fast when you use a higher quality bed. Very nice. Will never pay tanning salon prices for lotion again!</li>
    <li> The smell is actually pretty nice, which is surprising for a tanning lotion. But it smells good and the bronzing is very light, so it doesn&#x27;t look incredibly fake.</li>
    <li> I have been really happy with this purchase. Good price, works well. Smells really good too!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion.. I love the smell.. I don&#x27;t know if it actually helps me tan faster, but it definitely helps keep my skin moisturized and smelling nice :) I have tried many other tanning lotions in the past, but nothing compares to this!</li>
    <li> I have used only a few different lotions. I purchased a snooky lotion and while that works good, i like this one better. This has a better smell, i feel it moisturizes skin more. I also seem just as dark for a much lower price.</li>
    <li> Have always loved Australian Gold products....I liked this product, but didn&#x27;t feel it gave me any more benefit than the regular AG Accelerator.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product, I rarely tan but did did because i don&#x27;t think is healthy for you but I got really pale after this long winter ( I&#x27;m Latina but I can be very pale especially my legs). Only one time use and I got nice color, I&#x27;m sure if you like tan often, this is for you !</li>
    <li> This lotion smells incredible, like bubble gum! Instantly softns skin &amp; is a great accelerator. I am a big fan of all AG products as they seem to work best for me, a fair skinned ginger who has trouble just getting a base tan. I actually recommend it because I have a daughter whom has dark hair &amp; very fair skin who had been tanning for 2 wks &amp; was getting almost no color what so ever, I bought this &amp; after only one time tanning she FINALLY got some color when none of the other lotions I had that did not work for her! :-)  Candi</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super pale! And i always always always burn instead of tan under the sun. Decided to try this and it actually worked. After one day in the sun my legs were sun kissed! it was exactly what i wanted. Hope it helps my fellow pale people!</li>
    <li> Very suspicious of tanning lotions, but this does really seem to make a difference. Scent is okay, too.</li>
    <li> I purchased Australian Gold Cheek Brown to help get my base tan started. It is a very light lotion and smells like your typical tanning lotion. It helped me achieve my base tan in no time.</li>
    <li> Just used once but love the smell!</li>
    <li> LOVE the smell of this. However, I don&#x27;t notice a difference right away like some of the other users. But I bet if I were to go tanning a couple times in a row, I would see results.</li>
    <li> Recommend ANY of the Australian Gold tanning products. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different ones and AG is most definately the best working and smelling brand on the market !</li>
    <li> Love this! Works very well</li>
    <li> Great lotion for tanning..</li>
    <li> This really does make your tan enhance. put it on before going out in the sun! Not after.</li>
    <li> Not a tanning pro so I&#x27;m guessing it works as expected... No complaints.</li>
    <li> works and it was affordable</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife (we all ended up using it) for our summer vacation out on the lake.  Works for either indoor or outdoor use and works well!</li>
    <li> Love my skin color kool item</li>
    <li> Smells great! Great tan in four dayz!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t give me the color I was hoping for</li>
    <li> My best friend loves the lotion</li>
    <li> Like this really helps tan</li>
    <li> Does the job for a third the cost of retail store.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Much better than overpriced tanning lotions. It smells great, and I noticed a difference within the first use! Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Great smell but not impressed with the color. I don&#x27;t feel that it works as well as other products because it doesn&#x27;t really have a bronzer and I like bronzers in tanning lotion</li>
    <li> Smells really good I like switching lotions and this one blends great. And the shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Didn&#x27;t darken as much as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> good smell doesn&#x27;t help with the tanning.  it have  had other tanning lotions that increase the beds ability, this does not do it</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion to go to the tanning bed and I love it. I&#x27;ve been 5 times this month for no more than 15 mins. each session and my skin looks great. I&#x27;m not the biggest tanning bed lover, but I do appreciate color on my skin. What&#x27;s a girl to do in March with 30 degree weather? Anyways, my skin has not burned once and I consider myself to have a Beige skin tone. I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This lotion tanned me quick and has a nice scent. It is lotion not an oil. Tan lines are back!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! I just love the smell of it too, and gives nice color</li>
    <li> My biggest complaint with a lot of tanning lotions is the odor, and they really nailed this one. I was worried at first, because it smells like straight bubblegum out of the bottle. But after tanning, the smell almost totally disappears. It leaves a mild, unoffensive, but slightly synthetic coconut scent afterwards, but it is very faint. I don&#x27;t have that weird &amp;#34;tanning smell&amp;#34; after I use this lotion. I felt comfortable running some errands without running home to shower first. It is nice walking out of the salon feeling like someone won&#x27;t be able to smell me coming from 15 feet away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I refuse to buy the ridiculously expensive lotions at the tanning salon after I already pay $70/month to use the beds. An 8.5 oz bottle of this stuff from amazon costs less than some of the single-use packets at major chains. Great deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very light skin. I can&#x27;t say the bronzer is super noticeable, but I prefer it that way. I do think it enhances your tan a bit, but I&#x27;ve never indoor tanned without a lotion and stay away from the super high-power intensifiers, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to!</li>
    <li> Good bronzer that&#x27;s not greasy and has AG great scent.</li>
    <li> Hahaha turns me orange! Not so awesome.</li>
    <li> Amazing tanning lotion! It&#x27;s not too oily or runny on your skin with easy application. I have naturally tan skin so this was a good pick me up to catch up on a nice even Summer tan!</li>
    <li> I used this for only four sessions because I smelled so bad after tanning when I used it. However, I did get a little bit of color from using it. Not good enough results to suffer through the drive home with the ATO from this on a regular basis though.</li>
    <li> I bought this tanning lotion because my skin was always dry coming out of the tanning bed but I didn&#x27;t want to spend 30-70$ on a bottle of lotion. I love this lotion! It&#x27;s definitely worth the 9.80$ and is a good enough bronzer to rival with the more expensive ones and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference as soon as I started using it. GOOD for the money.</li>
    <li> This was my first lotion of the season since I just started tanning again and it gave me great color and smells great</li>
    <li> used this on vacation at the lake and came home with a nice brown tan. cannot go wrong with aussie gold. like the name too.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t find it helpful or unhelpful.  It&#x27;s average but smells okay. Good moisture.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells GREAT!  It also works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin and am a &amp;#34;beginner&amp;#34; level tanner.  This actually helped me get SOME color!  I actually ended up getting a second bottle for my wife who tans very easily and it worked even better for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, it keeps your skin moisturized and smelling great!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this.  You have to be real careful though, she burns much easier when she is wearing this.  She used to sunbathe for about 30 minutes a day, but with this product, she can only stay out for about 20 minutes.  She is a white teenager with a bit of indian in her blood so she tans easily. Great shipping and packaging. Pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> This product works well and has a pleasant scent and is not greasy.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> The bronzer gives great color as you build your tan without being orange or streaky. My only negative, hence the 4 stars, is that it is kind of watery but not unlike most other tanning lotions.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this lotion.  The brownish color will stain your clothing so I would not advise wearing light colored clothing or something you don&#x27;t want stains on.  It has a very nice smell although it is not as tropical smelling as some that I have bought in the past.  For the price, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love the product, itself. I only had a problem with how it arrived via shipping process- The lotion had exploded out of the bottle a bit into the plastic it was inside. Luckily it was wrapped in plastic, but I was still dissapointed to see it had exploded a bit.</li>
    <li> I am using this but prefer another product and have reordered some of&lt;br /&gt;it.  This does not produce the color I lreally like</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing! had a great scent to it, gave me a great color and didn&#x27;t leave any streaks or anything.</li>
    <li> It usually takes me 5-6 tanning sessions to get any noticeable color. I&#x27;ve gone 3 times using this and I already have tan lines and a nice bronze color. No streaks  and smells good before and after tanning.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have a good base tan beware of this product! It will cause you a sunburn like you won&#x27;t believe! I&#x27;ve got a great tan and wanted to get a darker tan so I bought this product. I used it twice and got burnt! Be very careful!!</li>
    <li> Thanks to this bottle of magic, I am super tan and not orange!</li>
    <li> I used this lotion when I was in high school (5 years ago) and after all this time I try different lotions from Walmart Sally&#x27;s and the salon and none compare to this. I just started tanning again and have only went twice and all ready have color and I am hard to tan! Such a great buy and I promise you wi never want to buy $60+ lotions again</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion.  I only use the tanning bed in the summer months but when I do this is the lotion I go for.  The smell is wonderful people always compliment on it and it leaves a golden bronze glow after you put in on that makes you look even tanner.  I am really weird about greasy feeling on my skin and I noticed this will leave a little excess grease but nothing unbearable.  Once you shower though it&#x27;s completely gone.  Overall I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am a pale freckled reddish brown head, and tend to burn/fry when tanning. Have been looking for lotion to buffer me from the deep fry.  This is it!  Goes on nice, feels silky to the touch, absorbs, you do not have to use a lot - but you know it is there  ( you don&#x27;t feel like a slime worm in the tanning bed or after when dressing).  I  will never be the Cocoanut color found on the posters in the booths but for an Actual BROWN, one I can see after two sessions, I am extraordinarily satisfied and pleased.  The samples of advanced lotions with accelerators and tingles I tried, stung me even before I got in the tanning bed.  This is a beginners lotion or maybe I should say a pale persons good starting lotion. I did tinge pink and itch some on my back blades and bra line, but those areas are hard to reach and so I poach that on my application not the lotion. I love a good smell and as I have only used a few products this one smells fine. Fruity and salty beach smell but not like you want to eat it smell. Would definitely recommend for Reality Minded pale girls who want to tan but not Toast.  Very happy  consumer .</li>
    <li> love the smell and I can not get locally now. warm it up by putting on heater in car. nice</li>
    <li> Maybe I am too picky about how things smell (before, during and after) but this lotion is awful! It is the typical AG orangy smell. It is very runny in consistancy and felt like it never really absorbed into my skin. Tanning after smell was just gross!!!! I would say it tanned ok, definately a level 1.</li>
    <li> I use it for outdoor tanning and it&#x27;s great.  It&#x27;s the best smelling sun tan lotion I have ever smelled, similar to bubble gum or cotton candy!</li>
    <li> BEST working tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. It has a great smell to it and it doesn&#x27;t stain. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone and I also received it in no time!</li>
    <li> a good taning lotion to start a tan base&lt;br /&gt;if you love austalain gold lotion (the smell)&lt;br /&gt;this is a tanning lotion for all type of skin</li>
    <li> Works amazingly! I get very dark in a short amount of time with this!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really feel like it helps tan much to be honest</li>
    <li> It hasn&#x27;t really given me significant color but i know i&#x27;m darker than before. Mostly i wish it had some sunscreen in it so i didn&#x27;t have to put two lotions on before i tan, but it is a good bronzer.</li>
    <li> Great smelling and smooth over the skin. It lasts longer and seems to really do the job on my tan.</li>
    <li> Perfect for fair skin bronzer always makes me look a little Orange but this worked perfectly</li>
    <li> I like the smell and it did get me a few shades darker in just a few visits.</li>
    <li> Personally, I won&#x27;t buy this again because it smelled like cotton candy and was just weird. It gives you an immediate bronze that just washes away when you shower. Haha</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. I definitely notice a different when I use this. And the smell is so great! I love the smell of this stuff</li>
    <li> love my tanning lotion i saw a difference by just one tanning session and it smells great! and in a good size bottle</li>
    <li> I love this. it don&#x27;t let you get to dark but it helps in speeding up the tanning process without getting too dark</li>
    <li> I have dirty blonde hair and green eyes and it gets me a very natural looking tan</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion because I just wanted to try something different. I&#x27;ve used it twice and I&#x27;m happy that I bought it. You get what you pay for... it won&#x27;t make you insanely dark so if you are just starting out or you&#x27;re tanning during the winter, this product is for you. It smells good to me, it smells like bubblegum. Shipping is fast. I ordered it Thursday evening and it was at my house Monday.</li>
    <li> Smells great; works great.</li>
    <li> Works great in the tanning bed, smellz amazing and loved the result</li>
    <li> Smells good, good product fast shipping</li>
    <li> I really like Australian Gold products, they always have a great scent.  I purchased this because I was looking for a new tanning lotion with bronzer and it sounded cute.  It gives me a great tan too!</li>
    <li> I like the smell of it. Smells really good.  Helps with the stinky burned skin smell. LOL!  I didn&#x27;t see where it made me any darker though? It says its an accelerator...I didn&#x27;t think it helped much with that. It is moisturizing though so it did help me not become so dry.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and don&#x27;t want to spend any extra time or money in the highest level tanning bed. Using this product I was able to get dark right away in the lowest level bed! Better than any $50 bottle I have bought in the past. Smells good enough I also put on to walk the dog or work in garden. Very good investment for ladies like me over 45 not wanting to overdo the tan.</li>
    <li> I rated this item as \\&quot;it&#x27;s Ok\\&quot;, although I have not used it yet. I was very disappointed when I received this item. From what I understand, it was shipped directly from the seller.  I rec&#x27;d it in a padded mailer envelope and the smell of the lotion was very strong. I opened it and realized why...They only had a single piece of tape covering the cap (which was open) and approx 25% of the lotion was all over the inside of the envelope.  This company should take more care when shipping their product. I plan to e-mail them as well. Thanks...Jeannie Snyder</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the smell but does the job.</li>
    <li> Love Australian Gold. It&#x27;s my go to lotion.</li>
    <li> Smells great and love what it does for my skin!</li>
    <li> This stuff works and is way cheaper than buying at the salon. Plus it smells so good!</li>
    <li> This is a great tanning product....I always use Australian Gold products...They are reasonably priced.....It does a great job; much better than the expensive ones.....</li>
    <li> I tan easily; however, this &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; tanning lotion hardly made a difference. If fact, I probably could have skipped the application altogether and gotten the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, the smell is decent.</li>
    <li> Weather not warm enough to use yet. Will update once I have had a chance to use it.</li>
    <li> AG is a great company for lotions.  This is a light brown lotion.  No tingle.  Provides great color.  I would purchase again as it can be used indoor or outdoor for tanning.</li>
    <li> Tanning products are as personal a choice as any shampoo or deordorant. We all have our own unique set of goals when it comes to grooming and self-care products, be it the smell,oily or whatever. I use Australian Gold Cheeky Brown Tanning Accelerator Plus Bronzer shown above for several reasons. First, I know the reputation of Australian Gold is one of producing a high quality product at a reasonable price. Far to often, especially with tanning products, we pay for the &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; and get little value for our dollar. Australian Gold is one where I believe I&#x27;m getting a top quality product for the best value. Secondly, I like the fact that a little goes a long way. It has a slight, rather pleasent vanilla/coconut smell to it. The lotion goes on smooth and there&#x27;s no danger of streaks or splotches---a serious issue for someone who has no experience with body lotions and such! It also has a natural bronzer, which I find very important since a fair skinned blonde. Lasly, perhaps most importantly, I like the results. Cheeky Brown gives me the color I want without a lot of fuss and muss. But, here&#x27;s a word of warning, this product does not contain any sunscreen, so when using it, keep that in mind.  Product comes in a 8.5 oz. plastic bottle with a easy to open pop-up cap. Give it a try, I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> I think this does really good stuff for my skin, but the smell after tanning is terrrrrrrrible. Their peace love and cupcakes one is definitely better.</li>
    <li> Purchased this because my wedding is coming up and I need to even out my fading summer tan. Works decent... results are not as quick as expected but it does work. I have learned that any tanning product that is for BOTH indoor &amp; outdoor - are not as effective in a tanning bed. I switched to a different product, might use this one in the summer outside.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it can be used both in a tanning bed and outdoors. When I used it at the tanning salon it worked great and I noticed a difference right away! I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave you looking orangy as some tanning lotions with bronzer do. I have been using it outdoors as well in natural sunlight however I don&#x27;t really see a difference in my tan. Either way I would def buy again just to use at the salon.</li>
    <li> No need to spend an excessive amount of money for a quality tanning lotion.  This does the job as well as higher-end products.</li>
    <li> Love texture and scent</li>
    <li> Omg this stuff is amazing!  I love it.. I  love the price of it too. it smells sweet but not overpowering.  Like brown sugar. I was very pale. Now after using cheaky brown I&#x27;m a  nice light tan/ awesome base tan. I will be buying more of cheaky brown and next I&#x27;m going to try is peace love &amp;cupcakes.  Also it shipped super fast.</li>
    <li> I give this rating cause it is the best, I love the product it has the right about bronzer if you are looking for the right indoor tanning lotion..look no more this is it!</li>
    <li> This lotion was priced nicely, about $25 cheaper than at the local tanning salon.  Absorbs nicely and smells nice as well.</li>
    <li> Smells very good &amp; seems to work pretty well. Once I got a base tan &amp; started using this to maintain my tan it helped me to keep that dark tan that I had.</li>
    <li> The AG lotion without the bronzer has been around forever. I always knew it as the low end tanning lotion and I felt like there were others out there that did a much better job. Well AG stepped it up this time. It took its most basic tanning lotion and added a fabulous bronzer. I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to lotions, bronzers, and tanning in general. This product well exceeded my expectations. The bronzer definitely helps add color and does not look fake at all but it&#x27;s still forgiving enough that you don&#x27;t have to worry about applying it perfectly and ending up with streaks. I would not recommend most tanning lotions merely for the extreme price tag but with this product you get more than your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> Wife didn&#x27;t say this stuff was bad or anything so I assume it worked okay when she went tanning.</li>
    <li> i love australian gold products.. and just not to please with this product. i love the australian gold lotion with 4/6/8 spf but have a hard time locating it. It is in a white bottle with gold labeling.</li>
    <li> For this price, I would definitely recommend this lotion.  The lotions sold at salons are way overpriced and the Australian Gold works just as well.</li>
    <li> This lotion is a great price, has a great scent, and is all you really need for indoor tanning. Don&#x27;t let the shops upsell you to the expensive stuff. This lotion has NO oils, so you should be able to use them in any bed.</li>
    <li> Been using AG products for many years. Will try other brands to switch things up occasionally, but always go back to the gold. Love the bronzer in this. No orange. No streaking. Just nice, deep color. Nicely scented.. Go on and git u sum.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product, I purchased it years ago at a tanning salon when I was fake baking.  I found it in my cupboard and used it last year and everyone commented on what a dark tan I have.  I explained it was &amp;#34;Cheeky Brown&amp;#34;.  I use this outdoors now and I show everyone the bottle and that is what I use to get a dark tan quickly.  I apply it and then put sunscreen on overtop and re-apply throughout the day.  The smell is great and it absorbs well into the skin.</li>
    <li> This came with no seal as well but seems to work fine and I get a deeper tan when I use it.. Why no seal though???</li>
    <li> Your best bet if you want the glowy non ommpa loompa skin!! It smells amazing and not expensive so the best product is this one here!!</li>
    <li> Love these wipes have used them for three years.  Even my 17 year old loves them...not too wet...perfect wipe, love them!</li>
    <li> Always a great product.</li>
    <li> This is my first order this brand and I am very happy with result. Give you nice dark tone just after just few times tanning and smell is very good. I definitely recommend this and I keep ordering. The price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Used it outside and it caused a terrible blotchy sunburn. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I have no idea if this actually accelerates tanning, but it smells delicious, goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, and moisturizes beautifully - so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> Smells pretty good... Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin... But I&#x27;ve recieved better color results from other lotions... Millennium black has gret color... Along with most designer skin products.</li>
    <li> This product is good for starting your tanning sessions but after you&#x27;ve gotten a little color it doesn&#x27;t get much darker so you&#x27;ll have to buy a stronger type of lotion to get past the beginning stage of color.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Australian Gold Tanning Lotions. I&#x27;ve tried many other brands but I found this brand the best so far. I live in Florida and we at the beach almost every weekend so a good lotion is a must here. I have very light skin and burn semi-easy. I usually start the season with SPF 30 Australian Bronzer, apply it every 2 hours. Then I switch over to this one but I combine this the Maui Babe Browning Lotion. Maui Babe is a special lotion originally from Hawaii. The combination of these 2 lotions gives me a nice tan super fast, I never burn and leave my skin soft, not dry, even after a whole day at the beach. I have not seen this lotion at any store so I ordered it from here; so I did the same with the Maui Babe,. I have Prime so my items arrive within 2 days, free shipping, you can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning lotion I have purchased in a long time. Great smell, nice color that lasted, and the price was great! Worth it!</li>
    <li> Smells great and works great!</li>
    <li> I used to work in a tanning salon, and have since gotten very pale, and wanted to start tanning so that I wasn&#x27;t SNOW white, which, I usually am without a care in the world. I&#x27;ve only had a handful of sessions, all under 10 minutes in a stand-up bed. I don&#x27;t have super exaggerated color, but I am happy that this has accelerator and bronzer in it. The smell isn&#x27;t that great, but I don&#x27;t think any tanning lotion smells good. Overall, it&#x27;s giving me an alright base tan to move on to some higher bronzers. Goes on smooth, feels like a good lotion, and I&#x27;m never oily from it. Happy with the purchase based on price and how much tan I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Used frequently or just once, gives the bronze glow glow without the scary over tan look. Also smells yummy! Love this and will be repurchasing when my bottle is empty!</li>
    <li> I thought I had thoroughly done my research on this product..and I did, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I put it on thoroughly three times at the beach, but I fried.  I have an awful, very painful sunburn.  The product didn&#x27;t work at all.  :(</li>
    <li> After much reading of reviews on hundreds of different lotions, I decided to try this one out. It had great ratings/reviews and was inexpensive. I am normally a fan of Australian Gold products, but I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of this. In fact, after using only half the bottle, I ended up tossing it and buying a different one instead. It smells good, but leaves that burnt skin after odor smell when you&#x27;re done tanning. I also did not get as brown as I was hoping until I changed lotions. (The Designer Skin brand &amp;#34;Love Junkie&amp;#34; is the one I switched to which I am in love with)</li>
    <li> Loving this lotion! Got a little darker after first use! And I&#x27;m super pale lol</li>
    <li> Love this - great price - smells good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for a while without using any tanning lotion at all, but when I started using this tanning lotion, I noticed that it seemed to be accelerating nicely. Not a huge amount, mind you; but noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent, and it goes on nice and smooth. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t seem to discolor clothing -- definitely a bonus!</li>
    <li> This is a great tanning lotion.  I am very happy with the purchase.  It was also a very good price!</li>
    <li> I wanted a product that I could use that wouldn&#x27;t make me look like I spent all my time getting a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; tan. Just needed something to help me look tanned without being too dark. Works perfect at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I am very pale naturally and it&#x27;s always been difficult to tan, but this product seriously works!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over 2 weeks and I&#x27;m at least a  whole shade darker!</li>
    <li> This is a very good base lotion for virgin tanners. I gives the skin a nice even glow and doesn&#x27;t turn you orange. Start with Checky Brown a for a couple weeks then move your way up to a tingle lotion to darken if you like.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion! It smells wonderful and feels amazing! I am absolutely gonna buy more of this!! Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> Strong smell to this product. It was just okay. I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I seen I could buy this lotion for $9 and free shipping!!! It&#x27;s in salons for $29. It&#x27;s my favorite lotion. I&#x27;m a very white individual and this lotion will get me tan in less then 2 weeks. It also arrived in a very good time.</li>
    <li> it smells great and gets you pretty tan</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a huge jug, and it&#x27;s not the most wonderful fragrance ever, but it got me dark and the price was right. A good go-to, baseline lotion that won&#x27;t break the bank, good for if you&#x27;re just starting to build a base tan (no sense spending the big bucks at first). Would recommend to anyone as a good starter lotion or just a good one to have around. Can be used in normal sunlight as well and not so sticky that it&#x27;s annoying to wear outdoors on the skin. Great bargain.</li>
    <li> Love Australian Gold tanning lotions. This one smells very good and works well!</li>
    <li> Noticeable tan in less than two weeks! It does not leave you feeling sticky afterwards. It does not tingle. Long lasting.</li>
    <li> I have used before and really liked it but, haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it since I received this one. But, getting prepared. Cheap and good.</li>
    <li> Meh. It&#x27;s okay. I have sensitive skin that has become prone to developing eczema in one small spot on my arm, and this aggravated it tremendously (as do the majority of tanning bed lotions). It did give me a nice color, but I won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> Nice scent and good color (:</li>
    <li> Good product for just starting to tan</li>
    <li> 1st time user of this product and I have to rate it right below the AG accelerator.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  GREAT smell. Makes your skin very soft.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion definitely gets you brown, but it leaves you feeling sticky afterwards. I usually use Designer Skin Spellbound because I love the smell and how it leaves my skin so soft and silky, but based on reviews, I decided to give this product a try. I do like it, but can&#x27;t wait to go home and shower afterwards because I feel so sticky.</li>
    <li> love this gives a great color and smells so good!</li>
    <li> Smells great and it seems I tan even better with this lotion on. The lotion is very easy to spread and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. I will be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> Makes my skin very smooth! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I used this lotion the first two weeks of tanning and it helped me get a base tan. I had to switch to a different kind bc I wasn&#x27;t getting any darker. Would be great for someone who doesn&#x27;t tan very fast. I will always use this lotion for my base tan!</li>
    <li> I used it for a tanning bed and it definitely made me dark. It was my 3rd time I used it. But it made me a bit orange so I didn&#x27;t want to use it often.  I like using oil for outside  tanning,this one has a greasy feel to it and smells ok. It&#x27;s not a complete  waste of money. But I won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Great product and it works really well.  The lotion absorbs quickly without feeling like you&#x27;re rubbing custard on yourself and I got &amp;#34;cheeky brown&amp;#34; after the first use...I also like that the bronzer doesn&#x27;t get on your clothes before/after.  Australian Gold has always had a superior product.</li>
    <li> I love tanning and I go to the salon frequently. I tan no matter what, so I&amp;#34;m not a god judge of character for it&#x27;s effectiveness on fair girls. It smells great and leaves me bronze.</li>
    <li> A lot cheaper than stuff you get in a salon (those you can get on Amazon too). This doesn&#x27;t have the silicone-based like Devoted products, but is more moisturizing. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price!</li>
    <li> Smells OK and works well. I am not sure if it&#x27;s the best lotion I have ever used but it is a trusted brand.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion so much. My favorite part of this lotion is that it smells great!!! I never get that after tan smell and don&#x27;t feel like I HAVE to shower right after. It smells delicious. It makes my skin golden brown just after a few tans and I hold my tan for longer than without it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it makes my chest break out a little.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly, works well, I think it is real tanning lotion since sometimes buying it online can not turn out well. overall, good product.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful ,not greasy, super fast delivery. I love you can use indoors or outdoors. Thanks ,happy customer. Will buy again</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling tanning lotion I have ever used. I hated going tanning because I felt like I smelled like a fake tan unless I showered immediately after which meant no quick sessions on errand days! This however has a nice, almost bubblegum, floral scent that fades away after about 20 minutes so I can go about my day. It isnt a drastic difference from other medium products but it definitely contributes to your tan. My friend and I both use this product and love it even though our complexions are very different.</li>
    <li> Works well and worth the price!</li>
    <li> Good price and exactly what we were looking for. Good indoor tanning lotion, nothing too fancy. I have sensitive skin and this stuff does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to tan indoors to help get a base tan before summer. It is doing its job for me. It smells really good and it is lightweight and goes on smoothly. I also like the option that I can use it outdoors if I choose.</li>
    <li> I love thus lotion. Ive used several more expensive ones by designer skin, luminary as well as 20x black, also used adorned by devoted creations and this ine worked the best for half the price.  Had noticeably darker color after one use! Now the two designer skin lotions were also bought on amazon and I have heard there are alot of fakes. So that may be why I didnt have good results.  I compared the luminary an it seems legit the 20x black im still ?? But the adorned by devoted creations I got straight from the salon. I only used those lotions a couple times too, some you have to use for awhile before you start to see color. All in all for the price its a great starting lotion to jump start your tan. Im inpatient and like instant results that I really notice an this product gave me that. It is a little thinner in consistency than others ive used. But for me that just means I use less. No greasy residue left in the bed after I tan. Smells decent! Definitely worth a shot!</li>
    <li> smells great and works awesome.</li>
    <li> this is great for starting your base tan I would definitely recommend this to anyone that has a hard time getting a tan!!</li>
    <li> wow this stuff is incredible!</li>
    <li> This by far is the best lotion. It doesn&#x27;t tingle, it smells great, and does what it says. A plus.</li>
    <li> I tan frequently, I also do a spray tan about every 13days. I also lay at Sun Tan City in the fast beds 18mins 3 days a wk. I got this in the mail the other day &amp; I&#x27;ve used it a total of 7times now. To be honest not a huge difference, if you&#x27;re looking for something that will boost your tan this is NOT it...I feel as though I&#x27;ve reached a plateau &amp; was looking for something to push my tan a little darker. This lotion smells great, and leaves my skin feeling very soft &amp; smooth...however with that being said, I paid for TANNING lotion not a moisturizer. I would NOT purchase this item again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also just another note, when this item arrived half the bottle was poured out in the plastic packaging due to the seller not placing a strip of tape over the opening.</li>
    <li> great color, great smell, thinner than other lotions so you get your bang for your buck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> this lotion arrived quickly to my house in just about 5 days. the smell is beachy and pleasant but does not linger all day. this lotion accelerated my tan and i began noticing my color changing faster than it usually progresses. the lotion is not greasy and it absorbs very quickly into my skin. i love this stuff and even bought a bottle for my mom to use and i will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> My husband bought 3 bottles of this since we own our own tanning bed and they all were wrapped in its original package. The lotion has made me quite a bit darker since using it these last 2 weeks. It smells great, but leaves a very slight ATO (after tan odor). I&#x27;m a natural redhead and very pale and I have not burned, blistered or peeled since using this! I tan everyday for 20 minutes and I have a beautiful glow. All of our friends and family says it looks like we&#x27;ve been on vacation! Love it.</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion, most anything from Australian Gold has been great for me. Mostly because of the great smell.</li>
    <li> Works great and excellent price.</li>
    <li> Wow! Gave me a nice glow!👌</li>
    <li> Nothing great about this lotion. Didn&#x27;t really make a difference here or there. I could take it or leave it. .. I actually found a better, and cheaper one at Sally beauty supply.. So I&#x27;ll prob leave it</li>
    <li> I love the dark gold lotion, especially when I first started tanning in a salon...the smell of the lotion is sensational and the price is great...</li>
    <li> I was looking for something with a bronzer and no tingle at a good price - this is it! It smells good before AND after tanning, and gives just the right amount of bronze (nothing fake looking). It arrived quickly and in good condition. Definitely a good lotion for a cheap price!</li>
    <li> Smells DIVINE!!!! Love it!!!! Wonderful results!!!!! This is my ALL TIME FAVE!!!!! I HIGHLY recommend it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Not sure it does a better job than other brands but I really like the scent.  Not sure if I will buy again!</li>
    <li> I bought this to tan before a wedding and it worked very well, made it look like a natural tan, would recommend,</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve tanned off and on for years and this is one of the only lotions that gets me really dark, isn&#x27;t outrageously priced, and doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling like burnt flesh.  I also bought the Australian Gold Sinfully Black on Amazon, but this is MUCH better. I can tell a major difference between the two when I tan in the same bed for the same amount of time.  It absorbs quickly and smells good.  There&#x27;s just no reason to spend $30-$50 on tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> It is a very good tanner.... if you&#x27;re looking for a base tan. I&#x27;d recommend getting Sinfully Black (also by Australian Gold) once you reach your base tan. This does not leave you orange or leave streaks at all!!! It gives you a slight natural glow even after the first use. I myself am pretty pale (not anymore) and this worked amazing with my skin. This probably wouldn&#x27;t be the best for you if you are already tan, I started off with this for two weeks and now I alternate with Kardashian Glow and Sinfully Black. The shipping was perfect and it worked amazing for a cheap price.... and the smell was great even after tanning!!!! I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Nice bronzer and the scent is nice when you put it on. After tanning the scent is awful.</li>
    <li> Nice smell. My husband has extremely sensitive skin, and he doesn&#x27;t have any reactions to this. We both enjoy the smell and it gives us great boost to our tan in the tanning beds.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this product doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It gives a good smell and I get a good tan!</li>
    <li> I really wish I could give this one a better rating, I purchased it based on the reviews and was hoping I would have as much luck.  It did not do much for me, I used twice and after tanning I could not even tell I was in the tanning bed and I do not tan every day, I only get in the tanning bed a few times a month just to keep some color going.  I think I will stick with my usual brand as it never fails, I only need to get in once or twice a week with it.  Looks like this one will be used at the beach or a giveaway. :-((</li>
    <li> Works great. Nice price.</li>
    <li> Have used twice so far. Pleasant smell. Doesn&#x27;t tingle. Noticeably darker after two uses, and I don&#x27;t tan easy. Hoping to achieve a darker tan this year.</li>
    <li> Great lotion, smells good! Would def order again!</li>
    <li> I love this! I only use Australian Gold product now after trying this! It gives great lasting color!</li>
    <li> GREAT product. I&#x27;ve seen a big difference in my color, and it isn&#x27;t streaky at all.</li>
    <li> Smell is great, creaminess is great, and it&#x27;s just an all around great purchase! After two uses I see that bronze on my pale, pale legs especially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this and wear clothes more confidently. That little bronze works wonders for the skin. I&#x27;m more beautiful ;)</li>
    <li> The sun together with the product produces a natural deep tan that is the object of envy of everyone at the pool</li>
