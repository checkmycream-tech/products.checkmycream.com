    <li> Wonderful body wash for dry, winter skin</li>
    <li> But nothing special.  Just like any other body wash you can buy at Walgreens.  I don&#x27;t think I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is hands down one of the best body washes I&#x27;ve ever used.  I am a self-proclaimed body wash snob and used Bath and Body Works washes exclusively.  However, I am now converted to Hempz!  I live in a very dry climate and naturally have horribly dry skin.  I barely even need to use lotion after washing with this stuff.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out nearly as much as the BBW products would.  Great buy and this scent in particular is one of the best!  You will not be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I use this stuff everyday before I go tanning. amazing I couldn&#x27;t possibly be any happier with this body wash.</li>
    <li> Its an OK body wash. There are certainly better options out there. The scent smells a little more like alcohol than I would like and the gel doesn&#x27;t do much for moisture. I love the pomegranate lotion but this misses the mark. I&#x27;ll use the tube, but I won&#x27;t being buying again.</li>
    <li> I says it&#x27;s okay it feels like a regular body wash.  no complaints as long as my body is clean.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash!  It smells amazing and really moisturizes my dry skin.  I want to try the other scents now!</li>
    <li> The body wash is great stuff especially If you also use the sugar scrub. The body was is vey sudsy and smells great. Wish I could find a local store and try different scents.</li>
    <li> Really love the smell of this stuff. Its gentle and lathers well!!! But once you&#x27;ve rinsed, the smell is gone. You&#x27;d have to use the lotion.</li>
    <li> After using this shower gel, your skin becomes very soft and gentle. Light and unobtrusive smell is staying on the skin a long time.</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this stuff.  It smells amazing and leaves my skin nice and soft.  I will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> I have used Hempz products since I discovered then.  The Pomegranate Herbal Body Wash works well for alleviating dry skin</li>
    <li> Lovely product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and leaves my skin smooth</li>
    <li> love it love it just love the smell of it would buy it again and again and again thanks great buy it was</li>
    <li> The scent is nice enough, a tad strong while in use, but is much softer and appealing after you towel off.We live as green as we can afford to, and this product has some ingredients I am not crazy about. I doubt I will purchase again.</li>
