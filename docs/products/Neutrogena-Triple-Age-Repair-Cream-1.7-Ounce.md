      <li>I will for sure be buying this product again and have already recommended it to family!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite!</li>
      <li>I was expecting this stuff to out-do the effective Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night Cream that I already use -- it didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Too soon to tell if this product delivers on visible improvements to face, but cream is nice and not greasy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It made my skin feel great and super moisturized</li>
      <li>It smells so good, and feels so rich and cream.  </li>
      <li>Skin looked like it had a healthy glow, more than what just lotion alone does.  </li>
      <li>When I awake the following morning my face feel moisture  and look flawless.....</li>
      <li>I love this night cream.  </li>
      <li>I am so pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>love the feel and smell</li>
      <li>In my mind it works :)</li>
      <li>It does have a very nice fragrance and is very moist.</li>
      <li>Dryness is almost completely gone, better than most products I have used!  </li>
      <li>Leaves your skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
      <li>I wish Neutrogena would make fragrance free</li>
      <li>More important, it really does a great job smoothing skin and keeping it so soft.</li>
      <li>Light fragrance.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t say that it makes me look any younger, but it sure feels good on my skin.  </li>
      <li>can&#x27;t see a rapid change but face feels clean</li>
      <li>I have a more effective face cream that I went back to</li>
      <li>This is a nice facial cream that I apply at night.</li>
      <li>I gave it a good try, three weeks, but had to stop using this and the daytime version and go back to my old moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very strong, and I can smell it all day long.  </li>
      <li>I would not recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin, it is not fragrance free</li>
      <li>Please read my full review for the Triple Age Repair Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 25.</li>
      <li>My skin was drying out and flaking in patches around my chin and forehead, and the scent really bothered me from day 1 -</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and item was just as promised</li>
      <li>to much fragrance.</li>
      <li>The skin around the area firmed up decently.  </li>
      <li>It smells pretty and comes in a nice little container, but I vastly prefer the retinol based cream over this hexinol one.</li>
      <li>I am a 58 year old, long time user of Neutrogena facial products and I love both of these products so much!</li>
      <li>I will continue using this product for a long time and will most likely purchase it again whenever I run out.</li>
      <li>However, on the 3rd day of using this product I developed TONS of tiny zits, mostly on my forehead and temple area.  </li>
      <li>little surprised - as I said, I love Neutrogena products and don&#x27;t normally have any problems with them.  </li>
      <li>but this made my hands very soft.</li>
      <li>Also I highly recommend to women who want to maintain young looking face and neck.......</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t notice any improvement with wrinkles or aging... but defintely improvement in my face being clear, even toned, moisturized.</li>
      <li>I googled this product and found others who had a reaction to it also, so beware if you have sensitive skin this will probably cause a reaction.</li>
      <li>After reading the ingredients list i am not so surprised, i&#x27;ll stick to natural ingredients in the future.</li>
      <li>No visible change in what it claims to do; to the contrary of other Neutrogena anti-age facial creams, which have performed well for me and are better than other known brand names.</li>
      <li>I have used so many things, and they all work but very slowly.</li>
      <li>But since I have been using the triple age night cream my skin has been so soft that I don&#x27;t need a daily moistureriser.</li>
      <li>Hi, I am a 51 year old female.</li>
      <li>It goes a very long way, isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky, not heavy.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product a few days ago and put a small amount on the top of my hand to test it out.  </li>
      <li>I am a 28 year old female with chronically dry skin this has me worried about premature aging.  </li>

<li> I had to stop using this product within a few weeks.</li>
<li> This one seems to work a little faster, yet is still moisturizing!</li>
<li> but this did a real number on my skin in a bad way.  </li>
<li> It wasn&#x27;t terrible, but I noticed the bigger difference when I switched back to the Rapid Wrinkle Repair.</li>
<li> Really disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was expecting this stuff to out-do the effective Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Night Cream that I already use -- it didn&#x27;t. It smells pretty and comes in a nice little container, but I vastly prefer the retinol based cream over this hexinol one. It wasn&#x27;t terrible, but I noticed the bigger difference when I switched back to the Rapid Wrinkle Repair.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of Neutrogena products, and have had no problems with them.  I have normal-to-sensitive skin, I need extra moisturizing at night, and I do not like perfumes in my moisturizing products.  I had to stop using this product within a few weeks. I gave it a good try, three weeks, but had to stop using this and the daytime version and go back to my old moisturizer.  My skin was drying out and flaking in patches around my chin and forehead, and the scent really bothered me from day 1 - it&#x27;s very strong, and I can smell it all day long.  It&#x27;s very unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little surprised - as I said, I love Neutrogena products and don&#x27;t normally have any problems with them.  I can&#x27;t use this, though.</li>
    <li> Not a miracle but very nice!</li>
    <li> I have a more effective face cream that I went back to but this made my hands very soft. It does have a very nice fragrance and is very moist.</li>
    <li> I love this night cream.  It smells so good, and feels so rich and cream.  More important, it really does a great job smoothing skin and keeping it so soft.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite! I have used so many things, and they all work but very slowly. This one seems to work a little faster, yet is still moisturizing! Softens wrinkles without drying!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re acne prone then this product is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made my skin feel great and super moisturized which is why I gave it 3 starts. However, on the 3rd day of using this product I developed TONS of tiny zits, mostly on my forehead and temple area.  I&#x27;m slightly prone to acne but this did a real number on my skin in a bad way.  I now only use this for my neck and hands.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  I am so pleased with it.  As I am with almost every product Neutrogena makes.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I had &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; prior to using this product, but after 1 day of using this, my face started to burn,itch and turn red.  I didn&#x27;t make the connection until reading other reviews that this product was the culprit.  Texture, packaging and fragrance were all great, but this went into the trash after 2 days because of my skin&#x27;s reaction.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my girl...she looks great so it works!</li>
    <li> Hi, I am a 51 year old female. Within 1 week of using this cream, I noticed a difference. I have suffered from rosacea for a number of years. This cream actually has diminished my redness, and has given me an overall even skin tone. Tiny wrinkle lines have disappeared also. The price is good too.</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell if this product delivers on visible improvements to face, but cream is nice and not greasy. Jar didn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;removable&amp;#34; plastic disc cover on the lotion itself (so the lotion was up into the lid) which was strange, but other than that, no complaints thus far.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my face!! Keeps skin smooth and subtle!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and item was just as promised</li>
    <li> Feels like silk on your skin.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin, it is not fragrance free &amp; i woke up this morning (the 2nd day of using this) with my skin inflamed, red &amp; blistering. Really disappointed. After reading the ingredients list i am not so surprised, i&#x27;ll stick to natural ingredients in the future. I googled this product and found others who had a reaction to it also, so beware if you have sensitive skin this will probably cause a reaction.</li>
    <li> to much fragrance. I wish Neutrogena would make fragrance free</li>
    <li> Using this product is everthing.... When I awake the following morning my face feel moisture  and look flawless..... I would buy again.......Also I highly recommend to women who want to maintain young looking face and neck.......</li>
    <li> I am a 28 year old female with chronically dry skin this has me worried about premature aging.  My skin color is very uneven as well and red in some places.  I bought this product a few days ago and put a small amount on the top of my hand to test it out.  The skin around the area firmed up decently.  I used it on my face later that night and the results were above my expectations.  Skin looked like it had a healthy glow, more than what just lotion alone does.  Dryness is almost completely gone, better than most products I have used!  I will for sure be buying this product again and have already recommended it to family!</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t see a rapid change but face feels clean</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin. But since I have been using the triple age night cream my skin has been so soft that I don&#x27;t need a daily moistureriser. but I still use one.</li>
    <li> No visible change in what it claims to do; to the contrary of other Neutrogena anti-age facial creams, which have performed well for me and are better than other known brand names. Of course, the 1.7 oz jar of &amp;#34;Triple Age Repair&amp;#34; cost half the price of what a 1 oz jar in other brands would normally be.</li>
    <li> excellent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my face looks great. feels great.  didn&#x27;t notice any improvement with wrinkles or aging... but defintely improvement in my face being clear, even toned, moisturized. love the feel and smell</li>
    <li> Just as described.  Leaves your skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Not working as well as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Use it every night.  My husband says it has made a difference.</li>
    <li> My life loves it and says it is one of the best.</li>
    <li> Good product....can&#x27;t say that it makes me look any younger, but it sure feels good on my skin.  In my mind it works :)</li>
    <li> Please read my full review for the Triple Age Repair Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 25. I am a 58 year old, long time user of Neutrogena facial products and I love both of these products so much!</li>
    <li> I like the Neutrogena line of skin care products.  This is the second time purchasing this product.  It goes a very long way, isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky, not heavy.  I will continue using this product for a long time and will most likely purchase it again whenever I run out.</li>
    <li> This is a nice facial cream that I apply at night. I am guessing I look thousands of years younger for it. Either way, I don&#x27;t wake up with dry facial skin. Great for those winter months. Light fragrance.</li>
