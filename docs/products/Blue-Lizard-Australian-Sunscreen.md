<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Our dermatologist recommended this brand however it was impossible to find at a walk-in drug store.  Amazon carries every variety.  And as the doc stated Blue Lizard does not irritate your eyes if your sweat gets it into your eyes.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> I am a biker and have several skin cancer spots removed so need a good sunscreen. I love this product. Not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my doctor. I am outdoors in fla kayaking in the ocean . I need good protection. This product is excellent.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen blocks out UVA and UVB. Not greasy, no nasty fragrance. I use both the sunscreen for face and one for the body.</li>
    <li> a little tricky to work in... but this stuff is the real deal with zinc oxide. the stuff i grew up with in australia.    good product. highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommends this product, as the ingredients are more inert than most other sunscreens on the American market. I use it every day as a moisturizer/sunscreen for my face/neck. However, it does need to be rubbed in thoroughly in order not to leave a ghostly appearance on the skin.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is light, non-greasy, great for everyday wear. I use a moisturizure underneath, and apply this on top every day. Make sure you check the crimped edge for the expiration date. I bought from Amazon because my local store had a shelf full of expired product. Some stores stick the sunscreen in the back for the winter and bring it back out in the spring. The tube I received from Amazon was fresh product, very pleased.</li>
    <li> Works Great and is Non-Irritating</li>
    <li> A great sunscreen choice. High level of zinc, though it seems to be nano zinc. Even though this Face version is not supposed to be water resistant, I found that it is. The added antioxidants are a bonus. Not too oily. It leaves a whitish color on your skin but all zinc sunscreens (with any decent amount of zinc in them) will do that. I use this while I swim and run. But to be perfectly safe, it would be better to follow the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation to use their Sport version for water and sweat resistance.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen on the market in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I am outdoors year round teaching boot camps, swimming, etc.. in Florida. The UV rays are high all year round. I absolutely love this product as it offers great protection especially in the water and dosen&#x27;t sting my sensitive skin. It starts out looking  like Kabuki makeup and then it absorbs-I just care about keeping my skin looking young and avoiding skin cancer.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m fair and freckly and burn like nobody&#x27;s business. i also have to be extremely careful with what kind of sunscreen i put on my face thanks to my sensitive skin. this stuff from blue lizard keeps me from burning and from erupting with a big firey rash! i love it!</li>
    <li> Works fine - a bit hard to rub in, but not bad.  Only a little greasy feeling</li>
    <li> Liked the product - used on my face and neck - absorbed into the skin right away and very effective.</li>
    <li> I think Blue Lizard was one of the first sunscreens to come out with titanium and zinc oxide, blocking more rays than other sunscreens, but also nice to use. Not the thick, non-absorbable white zinc paste of years gone by, this stuff goes on easily, dries quickly, and is neither greasy nor tacky. Terrific.</li>
    <li> Its one of the below average products I have used in the sunscreen. Its too thick and your face will turn complete white, one needs to spend additional time to clean it. Not impressed!</li>
    <li> I like it because it&#x27;s not greasy and goes on nicely like a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen for you face.  I&#x27;ve found that this is the only one that does not run and burn your eyes when wet.  You can wear it swimming or exercising with absolute confidence you won&#x27;t have irritated eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is I wish it came in higher SPF for the face.  I like to wear as high as possible, I know studies say anything over 30 is unnecessary but so many lines out there have up to SPF 110.</li>
    <li> I have a new baby so I really wanted a sunscreen that wasn&#x27;t full of chemicals.  However, I hate the way natural sunscreens leave the white chalky residue on you no matter how much you rub them in.  This sunscreen rubs in better than any other natural sunscreen I have used.  Be aware, though - it is still a natural sunscreen.  It will never blend in as well as the chemical kind.</li>
    <li> I have rosecea which sunlight worsens.  This year, instead of only using it from April to October, I have been using it every day, and I find that it helps my rosecea stay under control.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t burn my face or make me sweat extra by clogging my pores.</li>
    <li> No white residue.  No burns.  Exactly what I was looking for and happy I found it!</li>
    <li> This is a barrier sunscreen with zinc oxide in it.  I&#x27;ve used something like it for years that also has a tint in it; that product is a one-step for me because I like the make-up aspect.  However, it is much harder to find and obtain.  I thought I&#x27;d try this to tide me over in between.  Turns out I really like this stuff.  It is light weight on your skin, and though white, it does absorb into the skin and leaves your natural skin its natural color.  I think it actually improves the look of my skin.  I add my usual make-up over it sometimes, but I usually feel good to go with just the sunscreen.  Also, it goes on dry.  The other product I use leaves a shinier finish that I need to pat down with powder, which I don&#x27;t mind doing and which also looks good, but Blue Lizard is just easier for every day.  Plus, I LOVE the name.  My one complaint is that the product comes out too fast.  It would be fine for body application, when you need more cream, but for the face they really ought to use a smaller opening.  Just yesterday I had to take the extra and think of how to save it and wound up putting it into a baggie--quite messy.</li>
    <li> I bought 3 with the expectation it would not burn my eyes as someone had already noted, and sure enough it does not burn.  It goes on smoothly, so far so good.  Also the price is reasonable.  I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I applied this sunscreen to both my child&#x27;s face and to my own. My three year old did not have any skin irritation after several times in this sunscreen. I have also used it several times and for several hours during each use. I have a facial skin eczema, and I did not have any skin reaction from this cream, even on very sensitive eczema areas close to my eyes.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen for the face. I have tried many sunlotions and found that with most my face looked like an oily mess. There was no way I could wear sunscreen under my makeup every day. Especially here in Florida where we have very high humidity your face will start to sweat even more under a layer of sunlotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully Blue Lizard is different. The lotion goes on a little thick and gives you a white look for a moment, but if you rub it in carefully the lotion comepletely absorbs. You can wear this sunscreen under makeup and it doesn&#x27;t give you an oily face. It has a faint smell but it isn&#x27;t too overwhelming. Blue Lizard was also rated as one of the safest sun lotion brands without all the toxins that the more popular brands use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Dermatologist recommended</li>
    <li> GREAT UNDER MAKE UP THE PRODUCT FEELS A BIT LIGHTER. IT IS EASY TO CARRY WITH YOU.THE NO GREASY  FEELING IS GREAT.</li>
    <li> Did a great job of keeping this very pale, very Irish, very burnable Northerner from being burned in the scorching June Texas sun! Went on kind of white, but after a bit of rubbing and a bit of time, you don&#x27;t see it any more. Held up well with water and sweat, too. No skin irritation either.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this brand. Quick ship,and great product. Used on a cruise and very pleased.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist who is in not way assoicated with Blue Lizard told me that the ingredients in this product are exactly what everyone needs on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I can use this all around my eyes and it doesn&#x27;t cause my eyes to burn and tear up.  Goes on nicely and seems to last well.</li>
    <li> I was happy with Blue Lizard because It did a good job of keeping my face from getting burned while on vacation in Mexico.</li>
    <li> What can I say, it works great and is a great value. Amazon is great for stuff like this, when there are few options in a small town in the dead of winter.</li>
    <li> This is  the only sun sunscreen that I use.  I have sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;and Blue Lizard gives me the protection I need.  I would highly&lt;br /&gt;recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Be sure to apply 15-30 minutes Before going outside or into the water.</li>
    <li> I use this when I go running. It works. I sweat a ton and the stuff doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes. What more can you ask for? I do not have sensitive skin, so I don&#x27;t know what it would be like for someone who does.</li>
    <li> this has replaced by regular moisturizer.  Living in FL, I wear sunscreen every day and have tried dozens of products.  One of the best things about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t make you sweat after you apply it...it doesn&#x27;t feel like you are putting the usual facial sunscreen.  Plus no chemicals!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t make my face break out.</li>
    <li> This will be my go-to sunscreen from now on. So glad I found it. It doesn&#x27;t leave a white streak on your face, friendly to the eyes, and feels very clean and fresh after applying. There have been zero breakouts so far and I&#x27;m super happy with the purchase. The cap is a bonus because it serves as a very compelling evidence when you try to convince your loved ones to put on sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I accidentally left it in the car one day and the texture is different now (more separated somehow, I think the binding agent between the zinc oxide and the cream must have been affected by the sun and the heat), but some shaking would make it still usable. I think I will order another one soon. Just be careful not to leave it in a hot/bright place for too long.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen (almost!) goes on as thinly as a regular face moisturizer. I usually hate putting sunscreen on my face but at the beach and pool, you just have to. This product makes putting on sunscreen as pleasant as possible and it really works. Even after swimming my kids and I don&#x27;t get burned, yet it is a smooth, non-greasy product. I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day under my makeup, but for being out in the sun it&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
    <li> We love blue lizard epically for my kids because they never burn and it does not cause eye irritation.</li>
    <li> I will never be able to figure out why products like these tend to be from other countries, in this case Australia.  This is great stuff - doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin at all!  The cool part is when the lid of the tube turns blue, which tells you the sun is strong enough (even when it doesn&#x27;t appear to be direct) that you need to put on sunscreen!  What a great idea!</li>
    <li> What can I say It just works, very hard to find, The best stuff out there besides using pure zinc oxide, It leaves a slight white color on your face but its not greasy. Has a cool cap that turns dark purple in ultraviolet light letting you know when you need it most. I spend a lot of time outdoors in coastal California The only other product I would recommend is badger zinc oxide sunscreen cream its all natural organic but it leaves a heavy white color almost clown like face paint I would say that&#x27;s the best protection, But blue lizard is my favorite overall.</li>
    <li> My cousin is a dermatologist at Cleveland Clinic and this is the only sunblock she uses. My personal experience: Blue Lizard prevents sun burn (when used any sunblock needs to be) better than any other sunblock I&#x27;ve EVER used. And I have pale skin which burns very easily.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every sunscreen on the market and could not use any of them do to allergies.  This one though works great. I can wear it all day with no eye or skin irritation.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got this as a sunscreen to add to my daily routine. It&#x27;s so light it just sinks right into the skin and has been really effective at the beach even though it&#x27;s only 30spf. I wear it under a primer and can&#x27;t feel it at all.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations (I have tried a ton of sunscreens at various prices); fantastic sunscreen plus a great moisturizer; drys to a non-greasy glow on my face and works very well under my makeup.  Highly recommend for quality and price.  Will continue to purchase Blue Lizard for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I use this sunscreen daily on my face!  I mix it with my makeup and it goes on so well.  Its has great coverage and I don&#x27;t break out!  shipped fast!</li>
    <li> The sunscreen went on smoothly and did not run or sting my eyes.  My daughter&#x27;s skin is super sensitive to sunscreen and while the first application was fine, the second application after swimming had the tell tale burn. I would buy this again for myself, but still remain in search of one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> My family and I went to the beach for a  week &amp; we never got burned! Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love everything about this sunscreen: the UVB protection (it was purchased for use in sunny, high altitude locations), how nicely it goes on your face (absolutely no white film) and the price.</li>
    <li> I love Blue Lizard and this is the only place I can find it to buy. I have very sensitive skin and have never had a bad reaction to this product. Love too that  extra moisturizer is built into the product.</li>
    <li> Finally, something that doesn&#x27;t make me break out or burn.  It goes on dryly (in my opinion) and does a good job.  I find it completely free of irritation which is great.  I hope they never change the formula because it&#x27;s perfect.  The &#x27;sensitive&#x27; formula which I also bought is a little more greasy but still seems free of irritation.</li>
    <li> The item was exactly as it was described and shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Very good but to expensive.</li>
    <li> I have used many sunscreens over the years, and I find this one to be one of the best.  It&#x27;s not too greasy and applies smoothly to my face.  It also has a nice scent. I have had no allergic reactions, and have been using it about 2 weeks.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> First cream EVER to work on my extremely sensitive eczema skin! I will never change to some other chemical sunscreens ever!</li>
    <li> I have combination oily skin and suffer with clogged pores and minor breakouts. I like this product and think it&#x27;s a good sunscreen that is relatively free of harmful chemicals. It goes on a bit thick and takes a while to sink in, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy like I thought it would, or clog my pores and cause breakouts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for over a year because it had been recommended by my dermatologist.  At first I was concerned because the SPF factor was lower than I normally use.  The difference may be due to the Broad Spectrum UVA-UVB protections.  All I know is this brand provides the best sun protection out there in a chemical free way.  I highly recommend it to anyone, but especially those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I am impressed this product is light enough to be used daily, it protects against sun damaging rays, practically doesn&#x27;t have smell, a little bit goes a long way, doesn&#x27;t leave white ghostly residue I use only a pea size to distribute product on different areas over my face, neck and the top of my hands, good price, I will buy it again, I really like it  :)</li>
    <li> my husband had a kidney transplant and they said this was the best for helping hhim with the chance for fighting skin cancer for he is more septable for getting skin cancer. and i thank you for this producted</li>
    <li> I have used just about every product on the market. I love the sun, who doesn&#x27;t . I tried different SPF&#x27;s or limit my time lying on my back or stomach, thinking that would cause less damage to my skin. It took having a squamous cell carcinoma lesion removed from my shin to really take the damaging effect on my skin my skin seriously. My dermatologist recomended Blue Lizard sun screen products so I gave them a try. I bought both the face and body lotion and was totally AMAZED in the difference of this product&#x27;s 30SPF protection verses all of the others I have used. I have used products marked 50 Spf broad spectrum but never had the protection I thought I did.&lt;br /&gt;I can now enjoy being in the sun again. I never burn but I still get some color. This may seem a bit pricy but it is worth every penny...I now have my whole family and their kids using Blu Lizard products.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t wait as long as I did and start protecting your kids skin too.</li>
    <li> Love this sunblock. Helps protect your face but doesn&#x27;t feel yucky. We are outdoors all summer and this sunblock is a definite goto</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist after a bout with basil cell.  As an over 60 male from New England who burned repeatedly as I child and young adult I apply blue lizard daily all year long.</li>
    <li> Love Blue Lizard face!  It never feels greasy, great protection.</li>
    <li> Best face sunscreen ever!  No breakouts!</li>
    <li> Used this stuff daily (multiple times a day) for a week at the beach. It does leave a white &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; (not sure how to describe it) as others have said, but I just didn&#x27;t care. It worked wonderfully and didn&#x27;t clog pores. Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> I just start use it for couple weeks, it makes my skin a little more easy to break out.  May be because the weather is warm now. So far it is OK to use.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy, light protection. I have rosacea, and purchased Blue Lizard based on reviews by others with the same condition. It has been gentle on my skin, and I really like it! I wear it on my face daily, and unlike other sunscreens, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s clogging my pores or making me more hot and sweaty.  I know others have mentioned chemicals in this product that bother them, but I have yet to find something more natural that works as well. Until then, I&#x27;ll be using this sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Effective sun protection, but Blue Lizard stings my eyes.  I used it while cycling and I do sweat a lot, but other brands of sunscreen don&#x27;t cause my eyes to turn red, so I am going to use the remaining bottle for my arms and legs, but not my face.  It also doesn&#x27;t smell particularly great.  Kind of like plastic.</li>
    <li> I started using this on my face and it has a very light texture.  It seems to protect very well also</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this sunscreen!  I use it on my fair skinned sun who has extremely sensitive skin.  This is the first of many sunscreens that we&#x27;ve found that he hasn&#x27;t had a reaction to.  I have already ordered another tube!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works great--absolutely awesome coverage.  Held up to sweaty kids who live in the water--truly waterproof protection.  My kids are fair skinned and not a single burn (Even when we forgot to reapply.)  worth the spend--great value</li>
    <li> I bought this with the sport Blue lizard both products are the best non chemical sunscreens I have ever used….I am very fair skinned and used this yesterday for two hours in the sun,, without reapplying,,when I turned over,, didn&#x27;t burn one bit just left with a beautiful golden tan by the end of the day. What more could you ask for. Don&#x27;t try and apply on wet skin,,, use it on dry clean skin, and rub in until all the white is gone.</li>
    <li> I was already using Blue Lizard but had not tried the face product yet.  It is a little bit thinner so it is great for the face!  I have used many expensive sunscreens over the years and I have figured out that the fewer chemicals the better.  I strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> actually is quite lite for the protection this provides.  Spent a week in Mexico in the sun constantly and no burns at all unlike the Badger lotion I initially tried and sent back  Buy this stuff  it is good!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this.  My husband and I both use his and we love it.  It&#x27;s the best sunscreen we&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I read an article on roseacea and this product was mentioned.  I am thrilled to find a sunscreen I can wear under my makeup with no issues.  Being mineral based I was unsure about looking to white.  Product absorbs grreat, blends perfectly.  I am wearing it everyday with no irritation or breakouts.</li>
    <li> Used this for my recent trip to Colorado where we went rafting on the Colorado river.  It kept my face and neck from turning even mildly pink and didn&#x27;t break out my skin.  What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> Great, great, great. I have tried so many sunscreens and this one is by far our favorite. I used this every  morning on my face when we were in Mexico and it worked all day. I am as white as it gets (redhead with super white skin). I also hate feeling greasy and this one absorbs well after just a few seconds. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I like how this leaves only a faintly visible residue and goes on smoothly. I don&#x27;t break out from using it and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, either.</li>
    <li> Have used this in the caribbean and it works beautifully! Best sunscreen ever!</li>
    <li> Great for the kids.  My kids are biracial (black/white) and they have light skin.  When first applied, they can look a little \\&quot;blue\\&quot;, but it goes away a few minutes after its absorbed!  My kids have VERY sensitive skin and this line does not cause any outbreaks or eczema.  We also use the Cerave line with great success.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace my allegedly toxic Neutrogena formula.  It&#x27;s less greasy and made me break out at first.  However, after reading the label, there&#x27;s still toxic parabins in it.  False advertising from the seller.  Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I wanted a daily sunscreen but I think this will only work if I am going to the beach because it leaves a very very obvious white residue. No matter how much I try and rub it in, I end up with a greyish zombie like tint that I think one can only get away with at the beach or pool but definitely NOT for daily wear.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and seller! Would highly recommend this seller!</li>
    <li> I love the consistency of this sunscreen and it is great for the face.  However, I wish it would come in a higher SPF.</li>
    <li> I love love love this sunscreen. Not greasy, no breakouts and leaves my skin super soft all while protecting against harmful UVA/UVB rays. Sometimes it is cheaper to buy the bigger bottle, othertimes not so much so do the price per ounce before purchasing.</li>
    <li> This and the other Blue Lizard products ate the best sunscreen I have tried. We live in South Texas where it gets above 100. My daughter goes to a summer day camp where there are outside everyday and swim twice a day. I put this on her in the morning ( with no re-applying) and she hasn&#x27;t burned. The face formulation is not waterproof, but still works for her while swimming. We use the waterproof on her body.</li>
    <li> Light feeling  and effective. Takes just a little extra attention to make sure you don&#x27;t leave white on your face. An added advantage is this product is rated on the EWG 2015 safe sunscreen list  meaning containing no known toxic chemicals and is safe and effective.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Just make sure u are dry or it is like a paste.  Love that it only has 3 ingredients</li>
    <li> Great product - very reliable.</li>
    <li> I was so worried when I put this on my kids because they are sensitive to most products except Neutrogena.  I decided to stop using Neutrogena after reading about how toxic it is and decided to try Alba Botanics.  My kids got burned so I had to try something else.  This worked amazingly and not one burn or reaction!!  I love this but wish the price could be more affordable.</li>
    <li> Works well goes on smooth and rubs in fast. Will defenitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> My Dermetologist gave me a sample to use on my very fair skin and I liked it..Could not buy it locally so went on line to see if I could get the product as I was going to Florida and needed the protection the product affords.</li>
    <li> Liked the product a lot.  Order Blue Lizard every summer.</li>
    <li> Company is great!  Got my product the next day.  I highly recommend all blue lizard products.  I been using it for years. I have photo sensitivity to the sun and highly allergic to everything. I don&#x27;t breakout in the sun using blue lizard.  Their products and this company who sent the products are the best!</li>
    <li> It has been years I&#x27;m using Blue Lizard and for face it is one of the best.  It protects, never stains, no allergy, no red skin.</li>
    <li> This sun block is great and works for much longer than cheaper sunscreen. I bought this specifically to travel through Eastern Europe and all of Asia. And found myself only having to apply it twice at most. One application got me through nearly the whole day in most cases. The only downside to this sunscreen is that it&#x27;s very thick and takes a lot of rubbing in before it&#x27;s fully absorbed.</li>
    <li> Prevents burns but is very thick and difficult to rub in.</li>
    <li> Light, pleasant smell, and doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue. Perfect for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Did you know that emerging science suggests that blue lizards are less susceptible to the sun&#x27;s UVA, UVB, and, you know, all those other Uvies?  This stuff makes me feel like I can whup-up on any Uvie that even thinks about messing with my face.  Bring it on!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Goes on easy and no white clown face look.</li>
    <li> After using MANY different sunscreens, my husband and I are happy to say we have found an effective one that does not burn the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;All the positive reviews helped us with our decision to try out the Blue Lizard products.</li>
    <li> Great product.  thank you</li>
    <li> Three weeks on Safari in southern Africa, and no sunburn. This worked great! Applied it twice a day to my face, ears, and neck. It didn&#x27;t take much, but applied clear after a bit of rubbing.  It did not sting the skin, which was important to me, and worked fine with insect repellent. And, did I mention, 3 weeks of safari with no sunburn?!!</li>
    <li> Only one our dermatologist supports.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to use it because I heard it is the best sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;It is good just I broke out in Acne after I used it.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.. Ever.</li>
    <li> I take a beach vacation every summer, and some days I can be in the sun for 6 or so hours. I purchased this sunblock because it was recommended to me by my dermatologist. This was the first summer that I escaped burn-free. Granted, I didn&#x27;t do any underwater swimming and limited my \\&quot;lay out in the sun and bake like a rotisserie chicken\\&quot; time to a minimum. I agree that it goes on a bit thick, and you&#x27;ll either need a mirror or a friend to let you know if it&#x27;s blended in all the way. My face was a little white for a bit until all the sunblock was absorbed. Well worth it. Pre-absorption, my friends called me Casper the Friendly Ghost, but I was the one laughing when they were reaching for the aloe. I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> It is a great product and I use it daily.  I just wish it was waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Only Sunscreen that I have ever purchased that did not irritate my skin. Not sure why as it contains some of the active ingredients in other products I have purchased. A dermatologist friend recommended this to me. Goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered Blue Lizard Australian Sunscreen.  It goes on smoothly and protects well.  A very good product.</li>
    <li> Goes on easy and non-greasy</li>
    <li> Recommeded by my dermatologist</li>
    <li> It is a good product; works well</li>
    <li> Great for those with super sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Spreads easily and non-greasy. Affordable option among those recommended by Environmental Working Group.</li>
    <li> Great mineral based protection, non-greasy and easy to use. I apply this under my makeup daily, it&#x27;s a must whether it&#x27;s sunny out or not. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years and nothing else protects better.</li>
    <li> Love this - will be using it all summer long!  And probably buying again next summer!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Playing tennis in Florida at least 2 mornings a week requires an effective, SAFE, sunscreen and I think I have found it in Blue Lizard.  It goes on smoothly, no white (or blue) look and it works..no oxybenzone.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Fair-skinned blue-eyed Northern European so I absolutely have to wear sunscreen. Used to hate having to use it because of the eye irritation that results from sweating in the hot sun and the sunscreen running into your eyes. This stuff can still cause irritation if you are careless about rubbing your eyes but it doesn&#x27;t seem to run. Goes on very thick and leaves you looking like you have white clown makeup on until you really rub it in. Takes a little bit of time to apply properly but I&#x27;d have to say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Only sunscreen I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes with activity/sweating. Wear it on my face/neck on every bike ride. And use cheaper sunscreen on my arms.</li>
    <li> We love this stuff!  We use it every day at the beach and never come home with sunburn or irritated skin.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought this after attending a wellness fair and looking at my face under the ultraviolet light box. Have you ever done this before?  Very creepy..... anyway, I was given a lecture, I mean education about wearing sunscreen daily (I am not someone who suntans). This product was not only suggested at the fair but also by my dermatologist, my son&#x27;s pediatrician and it scores well by the EWG.  Then, I came to Amazon and read the reviews and decided it would be for me too!  This product is thick so a little goes a long way, that is for sure. Provides adequate daily moisturizer for someone with very dry skin in a super dry climate. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this brand years ago. Anytime I am going to spend extended periods in the sun I make sure I have this on. I am fair skinned and never get burned if I apply this and reapply as necessary.</li>
    <li> I thought I could use this on my face, which is incredibly sensitive to sunscreen, but I realized Blue Lizard makes another version specifically for sensitive skin that doesn&#x27;t have one of the chemical sunscreens that is in this product.  So I definitely couldn&#x27;t use it on my face (my face swells in reaction to chemical sunscreen) but I used it on my chest/legs/arms in the sun for hours and I didn&#x27;t get a burn at all!  Was quite impressed with that.</li>
    <li> I  have very sensitive skin and chronic eczema. This has turned out to be the only sunscreen I can use. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause an allergic reaction after I have been in the sun. Other sunscreens , eve ones labeled &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; still cues an allergic reaction but no blue lizard. This makes my life much better when I do foray out into the sun for kong periods of time!</li>
    <li> this product is better than most if not all other brands of sun protection</li>
    <li> This sunscreen was recommended by my dermatologist.  I&#x27;ve used many in the past and this by far is the best product in the market that provides spf/suv protection.  Love it and don&#x27;t use anything else on my face.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen that kept my sensitive freckle-faced girl from burning in the Texas heat. The kids love that the bottle changes colors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a number of skin cancers, including a rather deep one on my nose.  This is the sun screen recommended by my dermatologist.  I spend a lot of time in the sun and on the water and Blue Lizard prevents sunburn for me.  It does require a lot of rubbing in if you don&#x27;t want it to be visible.  My friends borrow it from me.</li>
    <li> This was one of three products that I had purchased due to being diagnosed with Malenoma. This works great on my face and was just what I needed in sun protection while in Florida on a fishing trip</li>
    <li> Let me start by stating that I have a history of melanoma and use a ton of sunblock...I am just short of covering myself with spackle and wearing a bee keepers uniform when I go outside! This product was recommended to me from my dermatologist...someone that I respect immensley.  I read all the online reviews and was pretty excited to get the product and try it for myself. After reading the testimonials and product information it sounded like a great product. I was leary that it was only rated at 30+ because I usually use 100spf. I used it just like I use my regular sunblock and applied liberally...and got the first sunburn I have had in almost 20 years. Not a bad sunburn, but I did get &amp;#34;color&amp;#34;, which for me is red and not good. I did return  it and very quickly received a refund with no issues at all so the retailer is very good. I went back to my other brand of 100spf and have been good since, so if you are very light and very sun sensitive, this may not be the product for you...but I did really, really want it to work as well as it said!</li>
    <li> Works well without multiple reapplications. Definitely keep it out of your eye even if you sweat. Mine are sensitive to it.</li>
    <li> I have vitiligo and live in sunny Florida, so using sunscreen is a must for me. I am always looking for products that have a low (or no) amount of chemicals, but still get the job done. I highly recommend this product!  Not only is the quality excellent, but it is reasonably priced.  I have tried many, many kinds of facial sunscreens, including some high end ones that you can only buy at Sephora or department stores that cost $30+ dollars.  This facial sunscreen is a close second favorite only behind Neutrogena&#x27;s Ultra Sheer Liquid Sunblock.  I love this product because it hardly smells and has a creamy texture that blends in beautifully.  It does not make my skin sting (like other facial suncreens) in any way, shape, or form.  I will continue to use this product.  It is worth every penny I spent!</li>
    <li> I had a skin issue (basically pre-cancer) on my nose from years of skiing and running outdoors without proper protection. I&#x27;m ok but the Dermatologist said I need to wear at least a SPF 30 on my face. I usually just put sunscreen on my nose, but sometimes I put it all over if I am going to be out for a while. I bought a brand that said &amp;#34;invisible.&amp;#34; Far from it. After you put that brand on, it literally looks like a white powder is all over your face. This product actually blends in and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily looking either. Finally a product that I feel ok putting on my face on a daily basis. Plus it was a great price!</li>
    <li> The bottle turning blue in UV light is a cool feature and the sunscreen feels nice (not very greasy) and smells good (well, doesn&#x27;t have that standard sunscreen smell I should say, which is great). Only issue is that it&#x27;s really tough to rub in completely, especially if you have some facial hair or even scruff. It kind of just sits in your beard turning it grey but doesn&#x27;t have rubbed in, which I haven&#x27;t experience with other sunscreens.</li>
    <li> Put it on went to the beach got a terrible sun burn. Puts a white film on your face yet offers no sun protection.</li>
    <li> much to difficult to apply unless you want to walk around with a white face</li>
    <li> Prevents sunburn, doesn&#x27;t cause my daughter&#x27;s skin to break out.  Can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> First face sun screen that I have found that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes when I sweat.  Only weird part is your face is ble after applied but that quickly fades.</li>
    <li> Works well and does not burn the eyes.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunblock i&#x27;ve tried for my face! So far no break outs yet!</li>
    <li> if you know anybody who is allergic to the Sun like my son and get blisters from it this product will help prevent any blistering if its applied before going outside</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time :). I&#x27;ve been using Blue Lizard sunscreen for years - it is the best for really protecting your skin. I have very pale skin and when I go to tropical places I need to make sure I don&#x27;t get burnt or else my trip will be ruined.  I use the face sunscreen year round for all of my outdoor activities and never get a burn when I do use it. I do tend to put it on a few times a day when I am in tropical places just to be safe though! None of the US brands I have tried compare to this!</li>
    <li> Use it on Carribean and it is true even after one layer didn&#x27;t burn myself. No more other brands.</li>
    <li> wonderful product. spread easily and is not greasy like other sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Blue Lizard!  It only takes a little bit to go a long way.  Be sure to rub it in very well.  It moisturizes my skin and last all day.  I just used it on a week vacation at the beach. I tanned but did not burn. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS, I will buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> great product...slow delievery</li>
    <li> I used this everyday in Cancun and face did not get burned.  Goes on well, smells OK and is non greasy.</li>
    <li> This goes on heavy but absorbs quickly and is not sticky.  It is very moisturizing and also has antioxidants in it.  Will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Bought this because of recommendation from dermatologist!</li>
    <li> Excellent does a great job&lt;br /&gt;Good coverage with little amount applied</li>
    <li> Got in my eyes and burned otherwise good</li>
    <li> Used the product on a trip to Mexico. Worked well did not get sun burned. I also used protective clothing but I was very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> The active ingredients in blue lizard are much better than the ones in other sunscreens. I also get a tan even with wearing SPF 30. I wear it all summer long.</li>
    <li> 7 beach days and not a hint of a burn on anyone. My son who has several food allergies and horrible reactions to reactions never broke out!</li>
    <li> Works great for people with sensitive skin &amp; excema!</li>
    <li> Very light weight and works great as a sunblock.  I have oily skin and this does not make it worse.  I also have adult acne and this has been clearly it up somehow!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this sunscreen does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do, since it was highly rated as one of the least toxic sunscreens on EWG&#x27;s website, however it does make your face look white, so it isn&#x27;t really a face lotion for everyday use like I wanted it for.  My husband said I looked like a ghost when I used it, so I guess I&#x27;ll have to keep looking for a daily lotion and just use this for when I&#x27;m out in the sun during the day.</li>
    <li> So far, wonderful!  I have reacted to ALL sunscreens thus far.  My dermatologist has had me try everything.  This is the first sunscreen I don&#x27;t have a rash, hives, or red blotches on my face!!!  It doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling like I&#x27;m wearing sunscreen NOR does it leave me shiny!  I am now ordering it to use on my body!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my allergist as the ONLY sunscreen to use; not allergic to it at all.  Well worth having to order it online.</li>
    <li> Effective.  Spread easily. Did not cause the allergic reaction that other non zinc products did.</li>
</ol>
