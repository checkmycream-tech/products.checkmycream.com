<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Yes it is not a super duper strong tweezer, but it gets the job done.  I got it to pluck my chin hairs, and it does require multiple passes, but it is a lot better than manual tweezing!</li>
    <li> Very good product. I would recommend this to anyone who asks.</li>
    <li> This is a quality product but you have to use a lot to get use to manipulate it. I still have to use manual tweezers to pull out really short hairs. But it really helps a lot for difficult areas like under the chin and part of neck and for the area under the nose its heavenly. It hurts a little at first but you&#x27;ll get use to it. I recommend this product. Next time I&#x27;ll purchase a bigger one for other parts of the body.</li>
    <li> I love this, it works so well. The results are great the hair is gone and takes about two weeks to start coming in again. At first it is a little difficult to get the angle right to get the hairs but once I did the process was quick. I wouldn&#x27;t call it painful exactly but I could feel the hairs being pulled out, it felt like maybe a little pinch. Over all this is a very good product and I would definitely buy it again</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work half the time and when it does, it hurts</li>
    <li> not as good as the original one that sold on tv. It does work just takes more passes across the hair</li>
    <li> Works but your hair needs to b pretty long..I don&#x27;t like the fact that it pulls n pinches your skin</li>
    <li> This is the worst purchase I have ever made on Amazon. That cute little lavender &amp;#34;Smooth and Silky&amp;#34; is a mini-torture machine!! Not only did it hurt...a lot...but it did not do a reasonably a good job &amp; it &amp;#34;chewed up&amp;#34; several layers of my skin as it&#x27;s been 3 days (I didn&#x27;t press the machine too close to my face and yes, I applied moisturizer)  and parts of my face still feel rough and are sore. I have fine skin (not talking about beauty) but I use an exfoliating face wash daily that is a bit like washing my face with sandpaper, I tweeze &amp; &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; when necessary, so I&#x27;m no sissy when it comes to discomfort. I read all the instructions and used it as directed but OUCH! Every circular pass of the rotating tweezers felt like little electric shocks...AND it did a very poor job of eliminating hair...some of the coarser hairs it wouldn&#x27;t even grab and the longer &amp;#34;peach fuzz&amp;#34; was only hit and miss...sooooo disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I should have read more of the reviews... This &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; but doesn&#x27;t do the job completely. It takes a VERY long time to use this too. It pinches like crazy!!</li>
    <li> Not overly happy with this product. It is able to remove fine small hairs (that you typically can&#x27;t even see) with no problem, but more coarse hair it can&#x27;t pick up. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to others, unless you want to get rid of the unnoticeable hair on your face...</li>
    <li> Works great on chin hairs especially for folks with older eyes that don&#x27;t see well up close. Works fairly well on longer blonde  or gray hairs. Even seems to work on hair on nape of neck for those with shorter hairstyles. Only got it today, though. Will see how long removal lasts and see what grows back in. Will come back and raise to five if that is four to six weeks. Oh, yes, and does not hurt if you don&#x27;t push too hard I don&#x27;t think. Also like small size and manuverability. Can stick in medicine cabinet or travel bag easily.</li>
    <li> I works but I wish there was settings on this. Really loud.</li>
    <li> Worked great the 1st time I used it; now not so great.</li>
    <li> It is convenient and small enough to take along when traveling.  The issue I have encountered is that the hair you want to tweezers has to be pretty long for the gadget to actually work.  I really don&#x27;t like to let the unsightly hairs on my face grow long enough for it to actually work.  I end up just using my regular tweezers instead.  It&#x27;s a great idea, just doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped it would.</li>
    <li> This product would not work even with the battery inserted into it. I used multiple batteries, but the product never turned on.</li>
    <li> I like it, works very well for my &amp;#34;mustache&amp;#34; and the prices is very good.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a great price and it does what it says it will do - eventually.  It took a while, with a bunch of circling and trying various angles, to get a bunch of stubborn chin hairs.  The unit heated up quite a bit as I was attempting this - and I don&#x27;t have that big a face or that many hairs.  There are still a few there, so I may go back in for a second attempt.  The pain when it does get a hair isn&#x27;t as bad as I expected, so I&#x27;m pleased with that aspect of it, but wish it would \\&quot;find\\&quot; the hairs more easily.  Perhaps it will get easier as I get more experienced and as the tweezed hairs grow back in differently (these were shaved, so may be coarser than desirable).</li>
    <li> One of the worst product i have ever experienced, as shown it didnt worked at all.. hate it to core.......</li>
    <li> Works well removing all those fine hairs that cover the face.  Not so good on the more rigid hairs that appear as well.  Bummers!  I was hoping it might take those off as well.  Had to resort to a good old pair of tweezers for those.  I would still recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I did quite a bit of research with these kind of hair removers before purchasing this one.  Most are a bit fancier, bigger, and way more expensive.  This little gem seemed to be an updated version of the one I had before, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My former epilator (of another style) simply fell apart a little while back and instead of just replacing it, I went to waxing instead.  In my  opinion, waxing is really inferior to this style of facial hair removal.  Maybe it&#x27;s my age, maybe it&#x27;s hormones or something, but the results from waxing just didn&#x27;t last more than a week or so.  I also tried depilatories, and they smelled bad and just didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington Smooth and Silky is WAY more powerful than the last machine I had.  It takes only 1 AA battery and really does remove even the tiniest hairs on the first pass...my big deal are my sideburns.  This removes them super fast, super clean, and it lasts for so much longer than waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does have a little pain with use.  Really though, no worse than waxing; so if you&#x27;re accustomed to waxing or tweezing-you won&#x27;t have an issue at all.  The machine is a little noisy with the rotating tweezers, but not a deal breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I prefer this method of facial hair removal to anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s really a Godsend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP:  After using it, I like to use a little toner where I removed the hair.  It isn&#x27;t required of course, but it does soothe the area a little and help prevent ingrown hairs from popping up later. (Must clean the pores a little :) )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck with it and have a great day!</li>
    <li> It was not completely what I expected. . But was still pretty good..it did the job reasonably well thank u</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first time user and had no issues.  As long as you keep the device at a 90• angle is was painless.  Worked great!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. At all.</li>
    <li> Awsome product and quick shipping</li>
    <li> To be honest I was a little disappointed in it. I&#x27;ve been using a &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; epilator for years to remove hair from my legs and I love it. I didn&#x27;t expect the same quality from the small epilator, but something that is similarly successful in removing hair from my face. This one doesn&#x27;t really work well at all. While it removes the very thin hairs from upper lip and chin, it does not remove the more coarse ones. I found myself running the epilator over and over again in one spot just to remove one stubborn hair, and more often than not I end up using tweezers. But if you only have thin and light hair on your face, then this may work. Another drawback is the cover; the cap was made so poorly that it doesn&#x27;t want to stay on the epilator. Overall I am slightly disappointed, but it still better than waxing.</li>
    <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think this was gonna work but it did and its amazing.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews.  I had expectations.  I bought this one, not for my face, but for my armpits.  I hate armpits.  They&#x27;re ugly.  So...why not give it a try?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOLY COW.  IT HURT.  Maybe it hurt because this is a smaller epilator and it took forever.  But seriously.  I thought I was tough.  :)  I did one armpit the first day.  The second the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I am SO GLAD I did it.  It lasts about a week.  And the hair grows back sooooo much thinner.  The second time TRULY doesn&#x27;t hurt like the first time....and touch up is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recommend this.  Just....be ready for that first round of torture. :)</li>
    <li> This product is well made and worth what I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;It just isn&#x27;t for me. It pinches and doesn&#x27;t remove the facial hair very well.</li>
    <li> Useless. I had high hopes for this item, but it doesn&#x27;t pull any hair. Sorry, girls. It looks like waxing is still our best option. In any case, don&#x27;t waste your money on this item.</li>
    <li> This is tiny and it doesn&#x27;t grab the hair well. Takes forever!!!! just to do a lip! Not a fan of this at all</li>
    <li> I  had been shopping for something similar to this for some time.  When I found the&lt;br /&gt;Remington tweezers I knew that was it.  So much better than waxing.  It leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> THE ITEM WORKS WELL, TAKES HAIR OUT VERY WELL, HAVE RECOMMENDED THIS ITEM TO MANY, VERY GOOD ITEM TO HAVE!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter after seeing so many ads for another very expensive hair remover  that really didn&#x27;t have good reviews..  I tried it my self after giving it to her.  It worked great on my chin and above my lip...didn&#x27;t even use a mirror.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to remove facial hair .  I didn&#x27;t think it hurt.  It helps to make your skin more taut like men do when they shave.  Great price!!</li>
    <li> I love this! I have always either tweezed or waxed. This is so much quicker, so much more convenient, and so much more accurate! I will never go another day without one of these. Keep in mind that yes, it is uncomfortable at first as you are pulling the hair out from the root, but it is easy and quick to get used to. I feel so much better about myself and my grooming! I would absolutely recommend this.</li>
    <li> It does not work! You will have to pass it over the same area several times and it still won&#x27;t get most of the hair. In addition, it is extremely painful.</li>
    <li> thsi product is really great . it takes just 2 mins once a week to remove my upperlip and chin hair. it does the job perfect ..&lt;br /&gt;i am in love with this product . :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my elderly mother who has trouble plucking her chin whiskers.  She LOVES it!!  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> What is with these good reviews? its nice looking, but does nothing. I am returning this. I know it does not cost much, but what is the point in keeping it, if it does not remove any hair? I cant seem to find a good epilator for the face.</li>
    <li> The only promise that is true as advertised is that it gives ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> I have been plucking my chin and lip hairs forever  This made it a quick and painless choir.  Some people said it kind of hurt at first.  I didn&#x27;t think so.  Much less painful than plucking and it only took out the black course hair and left the fine blonde ones which is fine by me.  It scared me when I turned it on, but no pain and all gain.</li>
    <li> I have shyed away from epilators for years and years as I thought the one I had was too painful so I started shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Well recently I decided that I am sick of shaving my chin area and it grows back to fast so time to try another epilator.&lt;br /&gt;This little gem I will never do without.....ever.  love the size and more importantly it is not so painful at all.  What the heck did I wait for, well I am happy now.  I figure it will cut down on water usage as I would take the time in the shower each day to shave with all that water running, just a thought.  I spent quite a while on this site looking at all the different ones and reading the reviews and I am very happy with what I chose and also the price is great.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful and so affordable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have PCOS and as a result, suffer from unwanted facial hair. i have full on, noticeable jet black facial hair that only gets coarser when i shave. traditional tweezing takes too long, waxing doesn&#x27;t work for me, depilatory creams burn, hardly work, and dont get the root, and epi-sticks are a waste of time for me. this is literally the best option. i dont have to worry about it coming back thicker because the hair is being plucked from the root, the process is relatively fast and the results are smooth and bump free. the only draw-back is that it hurts, but any epilation will hurt. and once you&#x27;re used to the stinging sensation that tweezing gives, you get over the pain very fast. the epilator fits in my purse and has a cap, so i can take it with me on the go, and it also has a cleaning brush which is very handy. you dont need anything else to remove the hair, unlike shaving, remover creams and waxing, which all need to be washed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;long story short; if you need to remove unwanted hair, this is the best option.</li>
    <li> This seems to work well.  However, it does scratch the face in some places if you don&#x27;t hold the skin tight.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this facial tweezer system, the reason I only gave it three stars was because it takes awhile to figure out how to properly use it to tweeze the hairs. You do not just put it up against the skin, you have to find a certain angle, pushing upwards, and then you can get the hairs. I found that it works for me to have the front facing away from you (as in towards the mirror you&#x27;re looking through)and pushing upwards and then down. Even when I find the right angle for one spot, however, it isn&#x27;t the same for the next area, so it is time consuming. However, I find this to be so much better than tweezing alone, because the hairs don&#x27;t break, they are pulled completely out. One reviewer said to keep your tweezers, and I agree because there will be left over hairs and it is easier to pull them out with the tweezer rather than fighting with the system to see how to pull it out by the right angle. I also prefer this over creams because creams really irritate my face, and with this, I didn&#x27;t notice any irritation, though the box does warn that you may develope ingrown hairs. What I liked about this was that even though I was having trouble figuring it out at first, it is ok to go back to the same spot, because it is basically tweezing so you won&#x27;t burn or irritate the area like you can with creams. I personally didn&#x27;t find this product painful, but I have been tweezing and waxing for years. I used the product right up against my lips and it didn&#x27;t hurt, but it did hurt when I would use regular tweezers. I tried this on my sideburns and that did hurt, but it could be because I never wax or tweeze that area, I just thought I would try this on all areas of my face with hair that bothered me. I however, did not use this on my eyebrows except to groom the top of them. So, all in all, the price is good, why not give it a shot?</li>
    <li> I bought this at a local store.  I intially went to buy Braun epilator because of the good reviews on amanzon.  It is a battery operated epilator with 6 tweezers. I was a little skeptical about this because of negative reviews, but this small epilator has surprised me.  This is my first epilator, in the past I have waxed or plucked hair.  I agree with others that it doesn&#x27;t pluck some of the very coarse hair but everything else it smoothes out.  It does take a little of practice with the angle.&lt;br /&gt;As per leaflet instructions, you are supposed to go in curcular motion, I found that just going up and down the area works well for me, otherwise it breaks hair.  I am familair with the pain associated with removing hair but with this there was no pain even on my upperlip.&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a good buy, $15 well spent.</li>
    <li> I liked this product. It could be a stronger motor, maybe wider razor area, right now it&#x27;s about 1/2 inch. It doesn&#x27;t hurt much, but then I&#x27;m used to plucking.  But all in all, I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> i expected some ouch to it but not any worse than tweezing with tweezers. Does a much closer job and got hairs I couldn&#x27;t get before</li>
    <li> It works although not able to remove all visible hair.</li>
    <li> Great for removing facial hair! Doesn&#x27;t leave whelps like waxing does! Just the right amount of tweezers and cleaning is a snap.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this for herself. She loves it.</li>
    <li> Product works nicely! Doesn&#x27;t hurt at all--only little shocks, but easily tolerable. I use it on my upper lip and worked great. The epilator didn&#x27;t grab the tiny hair though, but that&#x27;s okay--I got a tweezer and pulled them out. Also used it on side burns..works well too!</li>
    <li> The concept is great; the price is right; the functioning leaves a bit to be desired...I&#x27;m not entirely unhappy, but neither am I impressed.</li>
    <li> Light, comfortable to use.  Battery seems to last a while.  Does the job and is quiet when I&#x27;m tweezing during a TV program.</li>
    <li> Not good for upper lip.</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use. Large enough to fit well in your hand, but small enough not to take up a lot of room in your cabinet or suitcase. Works well.</li>
    <li> I really like this little Smooth and Silky Facial Tweezer ( Epilator).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used this method of facial hair remover before, always waxed. I decided to try this because of the reviews and the cost.I AM GLAD I DID!  I was a little afraid at first afraid it would really hurt.  I was so surprised to find that it was was more of a tingly feeling. It was so much better than waxing. I had a lot of peach fuzz on my face and upper lip. I previously used wax on my lip , ouch, and on my face with not very good results.  You could really see the hair when you looked a certain way in the mirror , or outside, or when putting on moisturizer.NO HAIR AFTER I USED THE EPILATOR.!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I exfoliated first.  Then I read the directions carefully, and kept them there for reference.&lt;br /&gt;I used it in slow small circles, and that still went against the way the hair grew. Going over the same area until there was no more hair This is different for different sections of the face, be patient and experiment a little.  Pull the skin tight with your opposite had as this really makes it way less discomfort. I didn&#x27;t get real red skin or irritated skin ,in fact you couldn&#x27;t even tell I used it except that my SKIN WAS  LOOKING GLOWING, SILKY SMOOTH, LIKE WHEN I WAS IN MY 20&#x27;S. I am 58.  I actually can&#x27;t wait to use it again.  It says in the directions to use it once a week in the beginning, and that the more you use it the less discomfort you will have, which makes sense because there won&#x27;t be as much hair and you&#x27;ll get better at using it.  I also used Aveeno dialy moisturizer fragrance free after using the epilator.  Worked great. I am thrilled.  I  This epilator is wonderful. I don&#x27;t know how long the battery will last, no big deal, think I&#x27;ll just get a couple of recharables and keep them charged in case  I need one. I would definitely but this again. Hope they never stop making it in case I want another one.</li>
    <li> the price might be low but so is the performance of this facial epilator.  at first I thought the battery that came with it was not a good battery so I replaced it with one I know is new, still no power, and good luck trying to get it at the correct angle for it to grab the hair.  it is not my first epilator I do know how to use them this one simply is not a very good one.  if this had been my first epilator I probably would not have ever gotten another one thinking they were all this bad and painful. if price is important to you the spring epilator manually operated is about the same price works better and has less irritation.I returned mine</li>
    <li> Works best of all I tried</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this little device for 3 weeks and I really liked. It goes in my purse everywhere I go. I was expecting to feel some pain at the begin but It was painless. It takes a while to learn how to find the best direction for your hair and some of my grey hair are a little hard to be pulled. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, you need to go over the hairs a few times to grab them sometimes. Much quicker and easier than tweezing.</li>
    <li> It takes a long time to pull out the hair and you have to let it grow so it can catch it.</li>
    <li> I originally bought another famous brand of product for three times as much as the Remington I just boght. The Remington is far better than the Epilady I bought, and much, much less expensive.  Thumbs up for the Remington.</li>
    <li> So glad I bought this.  Worked much better than I expected.</li>
    <li> this product was a disappointment...it does not remove a single hair...no matter the length..I&#x27;ve tried it various times...&lt;br /&gt;it is too weak...the one battery it uses gives it no strength at all</li>
    <li> When I was 8 years old I made the very awful mistake of shaving my fine, blonde baby hairs under my chin. 14 years later, I was a slave to shaving. Thick, black hairs grew in and irritated my skin. I was self conscious and sad. Then my cousin showed me this epilator! I immediately bought one and it came the next day! Awesome! My hairs were extremely thick, and this epilator gets them all!! Sure, it hurts a bit, but it numbs up. After 3 uses, all the hair was gone. A week later, and they still haven&#x27;t grown back in! This epilator gets the hairs from the root, which is amazing. I have very sensitive skin, so waxing was a no-go for me because I break out. I was certain this epilator would make me break out, but to my surprise, my skin is smooth and unirritated! Honestly, this is one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever bought. I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used epilators for 20+ years--4 other brands, 5 different models (3 for legs, 2 for delicate areas)--and this is the only bad one I&#x27;ve had. And boy, was it bad! Wouldn&#x27;t pull most hairs, abraded my skin and left a scar on my chin. It wasn&#x27;t worth returning, so I just threw it away and went back to a brand I&#x27;d used before, which works great.</li>
    <li> This good for facial hair. I don&#x27;t find it too painful, I do have a moderate to high tolerance for pain so I don&#x27;t know if my opinion of pain would help. I did try this on my underarms too it didn&#x27;t do a great job. I will just be using it for facial hair as it design. :(</li>
    <li> Whoa... this thing is AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is simple to use and extremely light weight.  Yes, it feels as though you&#x27;re getting little electrical shocks as you&#x27;re using it but it&#x27;s just the feeling of the tweezers quickly pulling out all of that hair!  It&#x27;s cute and very durable.  I highly recommend and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be going back to the manual process anytime soon!  :)</li>
    <li> This product does not perform the way it should.  I used the best fresh batteries in it and it runs very very slow and then stops.  I have to manually keep turning the rollers by hand, to make it start up again.  I am really disappointed with this Remington product and would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> This item works great. I have been using it for over a month and still going strong on the original batteries.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s. Does not work as well as its big brother. Less power and doesn&#x27;t remove hair well.</li>
    <li> Got this for the unmentionables (btw this is the wife of the account holder)&lt;br /&gt;It takes forever to do the job and I&#x27;m just talking the bikini line, not the entire thing. 45 minutes later.... Maybe I need to buy one with more tweeting heads</li>
    <li> I used this and it got very hot, quickly.  So quickly, I burned my upper lip within a minute or two.  I&#x27;m not thrilled walking around with a red, crusted upper lip.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It worked extremely well for the price. I have had it for a while now and the batteries that came with the device are still functioning. It is somewhat painful but not to intense. The device is a little noisy, other than that I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I love this item.  It saves so much time.  It really does pull out 99% of the hairs on my lip and chin.  There might be the occasional one that it doesn&#x27;t get, but overall it is great.  You do have to use it at a 90 degree angle to your face, and it seems to work better to move it side to side rather than up and down.  Once you get used to exactly where it pulls the best it&#x27;s not a problem.  It hurts, but it is a tolerable pain, and does not hurt so bad the next times.  The area of my upper lip directly under my nose is super sensitive, and I have to do it bit by bit and my eyes water, but this is so much better than shaving or waxing or plucking one hair at a time with tweezers.  I even used this on those few crazy hairs on my toes and it worked great!!  I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> I love this thing!! If you need hair removal this will do it for sure, good buy and I recommend it...</li>
    <li> then buy this item.  I was very disappointed.  It hurts.  I was very confident that I was going to like it so I threw out the packaging.  I should&#x27;ve never done that.  I wish I could return it to get my money back.</li>
    <li> great product&lt;br /&gt;Quick Service&lt;br /&gt;And a great price</li>
    <li> Works fairly well, it does take a little while to get all the hair.  I am happy with it, for the price, it is a good deal.</li>
    <li> works well for small area</li>
    <li> A+.  Like it and gave one to my daughter.  No problems.</li>
    <li> It plucks. It plucks well. It does the job I ask of it, and I use it frequently.</li>
    <li> Ouch ..but hair is remove for a longer period</li>
    <li> Does the job, but I have to go over the same area more than 3 times.</li>
    <li> As long as you get the correct angle it works great!</li>
    <li> It takes forever to pick up a hair. It&#x27;s actually easier to pluck every individual hair with tweezers.</li>
    <li> Absolutely does not work. Terrible product. Wish I could return</li>
    <li> made me breakout all over my cheeks. will not repurchase</li>
    <li> Does not work well at all! Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money.</li>
    <li> It works ok, just wish it could remove the hair faster</li>
    <li> This is small enough and powerful to do hair removal and the hair grows back much slower. Glad I have it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few months and am very happy.  It hurts, but not as much as waxing - and with almost NO irritation.  With waxing I almost always break out, but I don&#x27;t with this - I have even used it right before work; after a few minutes all redness is gone.  Before using it, wash to get rid of oils, then use an alcohol swab over the area (the single use ones are convenient &amp; cheap).</li>
    <li> works good for the price.It does not get every hair, works great for peach fuzz,but not stubborn hairs .It is not as painful as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Great but ouch. Use a cold pack on face to numb area before and it feels better I guess.</li>
    <li> I have two of the normal Remington epilators (one that is plug-in only and the other is rechargeable). I thought that this smaller unit would be great for the face fuzz. In theory, it would be amazing. However, I couldn&#x27;t even get this unit to remove hair from my ARM. There is definitely hair on my arm but those six little tweezer thing-a-ma-bobs just don&#x27;t want to tweeze. It could be that I received a defective unit as others have had success. I decided to try one of my regular size units and they worked GREAT for getting those pesky hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the other two epilators. I bought the cordless one because I thought I needed it. I really don&#x27;t as the corded one works just as good AND it doesn&#x27;t have the issue of losing a charge. What I&#x27;m trying to say is... I KNOW how to use the epilator, so it wasn&#x27;t user error on my part.</li>
    <li> Meylis Narlyyev says that he liked the product. Had no problems or whatsoever. A good price too. Can&#x27;t complain. A+</li>
    <li> This did not work I am sending back for refund</li>
    <li> the first time i used it - i hated it! but.. it really left my face smooth. i am in my 60&#x27;s now and it is great for those little hairs that you cannot seen.</li>
    <li> This little guy works like a charm.  There was only one review when I purchased but it was such a great price from a trusted brand so I go it.  I am so glad I did.  It removes the hair fast and easy.  It took a few tries to get the right angle, but once I figured it out it was great.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t take the hairs out - it just pulls them!</li>
    <li> Either I don&#x27;t know how to use this correctly or it doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good epilator for the price. I&#x27;ve never used one until I got this one.  It&#x27;s really good.  It does its job.  Note for those who want a quick way out of shaving: This WILL hurt if you&#x27;ve never waxed/tweezed before.  It&#x27;s basically like tweezing your hair, except it does it in a very fast manner.  That doesn&#x27;t mean that you can use this to epilate your legs in five minutes though.  It isn&#x27;t a very wide epilator and is best used for small areas, except the eyebrow region.  Overall, I like it.</li>
    <li> This hurt less than I expected; it works well and I was happy with the hair removal.  The only thing that I dislike about the process is that I seem to break out in the areas where hair was removed for the next several days following the removal.  I have tried exfoliating like the directions recommend.  I have tried several different facial routines--including just the classic soap and water--but to no avail.  I now only use the machine when I do not have to go out or to work for a day or two afterwards.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic.  Hurts, but I have a high pain tolerance.  It also numbs after the first minute or so.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. It works well for what it is designed to do. I&#x27;ve been traveling over the summer and it&#x27;s been easy to take with and is great at removing facial hair that doesn&#x27;t grow back for a long time. It is only for facial hair however since it would be too painful to be used anywhere else on the body, except for maybe underarms.</li>
    <li> Arrived as stated. The product does work but I wish it it had a shield/ guide to help catch the hairs.</li>
    <li> Great product, battery dies super quick though so that&#x27;s a downer for me since I&#x27;m used to the plug in the wall Epilator :( also its a bit small for me, but then again there are bigger ones all I&#x27;m saying is this product is great for small areas, but not for legs, armpits, ect because it gives me a hard time epilationg those with this, but since my old one broke down this was my fastest replacement . Otherwise it&#x27;s a great product (:</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. It doesn&#x27;t work at all. The Emjoi Tweeze&#x27; is much better. Unfortunately I threw away the packaging, so now I can&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> Works fine, I would recommend it to a friend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using it properly because I don&#x27;t get the positive results other reviewers seem to get. It doesn&#x27;t garb all the hair, is relatively painful and leaves many ingrown hairs afterwards. Back to plucking for me!!!</li>
    <li> There is a learning curve when using this to make sure you get the hair.  Sometimes I move it in small circles and other times I go back and forth.  It can be a little painful if your not used to either tweezing, threading or waxing but it&#x27;s a good tool in the arsenal.  I don&#x27;t use this only, I use facial hair removal creams in addition to this.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. In fact I bought 4 of them.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Only faults, weak battery and it heats up pretty quickly. The price is right, so I will replace battery and continue to use.</li>
    <li> It gets some hairs, but not the whole area. Will need to go back and tweeze or wax afterwards.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of worthless. It&#x27;s about like using tweezers that can never really grab the hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying them.</li>
    <li> Better that my old one!</li>
    <li> I purchased the product to remove the facial hair, but it didn&#x27;t seem to work. It is not pulling out the hair as it is intended to. You run it over the area where you have the growth, and it just keeps running with pulling a hair or 2 here and there. I am using the normal epilator from Remington and I really liked it but this one sucked. I would not recommend anybody to purchase it. It&#x27;s better to buy a thread and do it yourself. Would be less frustrating.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been gradually getting more hair on my face with age and wanted a quicker solution than tweezing and a better one than shaving so I picked up this little gem. It&#x27;s amazing. I have both thick course hairs &amp; thin ones as well. Once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s easy. The pain is minimal. Yes it hurts but i&#x27;d you&#x27;ve ever tweezed or waxed, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> Amazing alternative to  electrolysis!&lt;br /&gt;It works by removing the hair from the roots with minimum pinching sensation. Considerably more comfortable than electrolysis with  far less irritation. Not to mention the cost difference.&lt;br /&gt;.. Don&#x27;t get discouraged if you cannot remove all the hair on the first try, It took me three times.&lt;br /&gt;.. Avoid going over and over the same area because the skin will be irritated...Wait and repeat it the next day&lt;br /&gt;.. Do not press against the skin. It works best almost floating over the hair. The rotating blades will pull the hair out.&lt;br /&gt;.. Unlike other shaving devices it works sideways or up and down, in circles, but never pressing on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I think you will find this an amazing companion..&lt;br /&gt;Happy hair removal:)&lt;br /&gt;Irene</li>
    <li> Better than the tweezee. I had the tweezee for years but this works so much better and is easier for me to hold.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, gets the job done.  Now that I have a wet/dry one, I prefer it to this dry one.</li>
    <li> The Remington is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t pull like the Tweezee did.  You have to get the angle right for it to pluck the hairs and it is hard to use under certain areas of the chin.  Not as powerful as the Tweezee.  Overall it was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great! I&#x27;ve had this for a number of years and does the job well. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This does pluck hairs. But, the hairs have to be over a certain length (longer than tweezerable). I use it on my face. It is good at pulling really fine (nearly invisible hairs) and some longer, courser hairs. I use it as a first step then take the tweezers to the rest.</li>
    <li> Only used a couple of times but so far I am pleased with the results.  Easy to use and very little discomfort.</li>
    <li> I love this device..it left my chin hair free..no stubs no cuts or bruises...</li>
    <li> Works for facial hair, but not on other areas.  It&#x27;s unable to pull out anything coarser than what grows on my face.  It&#x27;s exactly what I expected and what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an epilator.  It doesn&#x27;t feel good.  It works better for me than tweezers or waxing my upper lip and requires no cleanup afterward.  If you keep up with hair removal (once every week or two), it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much because you don&#x27;t have as many hairs being pulled out at the same time.</li>
    <li> Works great, better than Tweezees</li>
    <li> It hurts, but it works.</li>
    <li> Its ok but because i have a lot of hair on my face it hard to take them all out.</li>
    <li> This was the first time I had tried anything like this. I used to tweeze alllll the time! I love this little thing! Like a previous poster says, it takes a bit to figure out the right angle, but man oh man this thing rocks!</li>
    <li> Its okay, I like the Emjoi AP-17LT Total Concept 2-In-1 Epilator better. I use it on my upper lip, chin and underarms. I took it on a weekend trip also, instead of my other one, since if it was misplaced I wouldn&#x27;t be as upset as I would be if I lost the other one. I usually use it when I see a couple of hairs that seem to have grown back faster then the others.</li>
    <li> This sucker will pluck the whiskers off any cat. It hurts, it will make tears run down your face but let&#x27;s face it beauty is painful at times. Luckily I had some numbing cream from a procedure I had done, I don&#x27;t know how I would have gotten through the whole plucking of my face without it. If you think you&#x27;re pulling each little individual hair with a plucker but all at the same time.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Never using one of these before, I went for a cheaper version and I&#x27;m very happy with the results. I don&#x27;t mind if there&#x27;s a hair or two it misses - I&#x27;ve never had 100% of hairs removed in any method anyway and one or two is better than next to none.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried seeing the pain tolerance in the arm and leg area and I have to say that those sting more than the facial area. And as someone who has her eyebrows waxed, I prefer this feeling to that. (I do NOT use this on my eyebrows. I&#x27;d seriously recommend not doing that. I believe the included instructions warn again it as well.)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this if this if your goal is just facial hair (it&#x27;s too small for anywhere else, except maybe the underarms) or it&#x27;s your first time using one of these and want something to test with. I recommend it in general; I love it :)&lt;br /&gt;((Note that it DID take me a few tries to get the hang of it to get the best results as I&#x27;ve never used one before. I&#x27;d recommend using video tutorials to make sure you&#x27;re using it correctly.))</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t reach the hair at all</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> Bought it as gift and the user seemed to be pleased with it</li>
    <li> Replace my Emjoi (which I was happy with) with this Remington (more expensive so I thought it would be better quality)...it&#x27;s terrible!  it pulls on the hair but isn&#x27;t strong enough to pull it out.  I just ordered a new Emjoi.  Plus the Emjoi is almost half the price.</li>
    <li> If you enjoy struggling to open a package with a product in it and the included AA battery which is wrapped separately, then by all means buy this product. You will be tired when you finally release it from the packaging. This item appears to be very cheaply made -- it is a very lightweight plastic and the single AA battery does not provide enough power for this to do what it is supposed to -- pull hair! I used it on my upper lip, and it tugged a bit, but didn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;ooomph&amp;#34; to actually remove the hair by the root. So...back to using my trusty Epilady on my face...carefully.</li>
    <li> Very good for this price</li>
</ol>
