<li> Unbelievable product!</li>
<li> I mean FRIED.</li>
<li> I have crazy hair.  </li>
<li> I didn t recive This item.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very sad.</li>
<li> This Distributor is also very difficult to deal with to try and return this substandard project.</li>
<li> and I was shocked at the salon or store prices.</li>
<li> Packaging of product was terrible.  </li>
<li> Terrible product!</li>

    <li> Terrible product! DO NOT BUY. This Distributor is also very difficult to deal with to try and return this substandard project.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair detangler on the planet!  I have fine hair, but a lot of it so it loves to get tangled up.  I use this every time I wash my hair.  It only a few pumps and no more tangles.  The best.</li>

    <li> A few years ago, due to medial issues and a lot of medications (that I am now off of) my hair became fried. I mean FRIED. Whether I cut it short or left it long, the ends continued to zap like &amp;#34;Z&amp;#34; no matter what I did to try to repair it. I tried conditioner after conditioner, thinking my hair was too dry but my stylist mentioned to me that I may be using too much conditioner so I stopped using all conditioners completely. It didn&#x27;t help. After about 18 months of struggling with this problem (I could straighten my hair with a flat iron only to hide the &amp;#34;Z&amp;#34;&#x27;s on the end but any moisture in the air would eliminate it), my stylist gave me a sample of this Revlon product and within 2 or 3 days, the zapping was 95% better! Granted this product has not fixed the problem, and I no longer use regular conditioner/repair serums, other than this product which I spray into my palm and finger it through my hair only after washing.  It has really, really helped plus buying it though Amazon is A LOT cheaper than buying through my stylist!!!</li>
