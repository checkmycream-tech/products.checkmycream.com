      <li>but I do enjoy it.</li>
      <li>Green Tea has always been the best!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
      <li>I love spritzing this on my face when it&#x27;s too hot.</li>
      <li>and it is a super fine mist</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t get absorbed on my skin quickly and it&#x27;s sticky!</li>
      <li>/&gt;-The fragrance smells good, but I don&#x27;t like facial products that have fragrance in them since it causes breakouts for me</li>
      <li>but I was presently surprised at how nice and hydrated it made my face feel so it didn&#x27;t matter.</li>
      <li>Definitely provides great hydration to the face, but the scent can be a bit too much.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love everything about this purchase and will most definitely be buying from package_go_fast and Innisfree again!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could not be happier about this purchase.</li>
      <li>The shipping for this package took about 2 weeks, fairly quick.</li>
      <li>Very hydrating but smell is a bit too strong for me.</li>
      <li>I use it right after i wash my face.</li>
      <li>It keeps my face feeling fresh and moisturized on a hot summer day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a sucker for natural products and I&#x27;m very happy with this one!</li>

      <li>Thank you so much for that!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did, because I really enjoy the cooling sensation of Innisfree&#x27;s Green Tea Mist.</li>
      <li>, you can use any time you feel dry and its refreshing, spray it into your skin and it absords immeditaely.</li>
      <li>spray isn&#x27;t very even and you will get large droplets on your face that you need to dab into your skin.</li>
      <li>I have really been getting into the mist trend, and this one is quite nice, but there are a few issues.</li>
      <li>Ever since I had this mist, I spray it before my moisturizer so the water droplets don&#x27;t escape as much.</li>
      <li>really moisturizing and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>

      <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t broke out, and has definitely become more soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>There is no smell... but overall its just another item on the shelf, its nothing special</li>
      <li>Took off a star because my normal skin becomes very oily from this.</li>
      <li>It worked wonders on my dry skin and smells very fresh and rejuvenating.</li>
      <li>I use this after I wash my face and it feels really refreshing and leaves my skin really soft, but other than that I don&#x27;t feel like it does anything else.</li>
      <li>Packaging was careful and thanks for the samples!!;)</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this will improve over time, but so far I&#x27;m not liking it as much as I want to.</li>
      <li>I use my mists all throughout the day especially in the summer to keep my skin hydrated and fresh</li>
      <li>I love the green tea scent too.</li>
      <li>It was refreshing just for few minutes, but i could smell the green tea :)</li>
      <li>I normally use La Roche Posay or Avene Thermal Water sprays, but I wanted to try something new this time.</li>
      <li>It delivers more skin care benefits per spritz than just plain water.</li>
      <li>so I wanted to try something new.</li>
      <li>I have oily-combo acne prone skin, and in the winter it gets pretty dry (maybe why I&#x27;m not breaking out as much?).</li>
      <li>My first facial mist and</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I regret that i did not buy a bigger one</li>
    <li> The container clogs &amp; also sprays everywhere it&#x27;s not supposed to... I have other mists &amp; they work well but this one is messy &amp; wasteful</li>
    <li> Horrible! Broke me out :(</li>
    <li> I just received this in the email, and it&#x27;s in great condition! However, I used it on my face (I have dry-normal skin except for in the tzone), and so far it seems that my face became drier than it was earlier... I don&#x27;t know if this will improve over time, but so far I&#x27;m not liking it as much as I want to. On the plus side, it smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;Also, after reading the ingredients on the back (it was all in English), I didn&#x27;t see any tea complex in it... there was some kind of camellia extract instead... Unless you don&#x27;t mind that the ingredients are not all natural, then this isn&#x27;t as \\&quot;natural\\&quot; as we thought it was.</li>
    <li> Hydrates really well. Great for summer</li>
    <li> The shipping for this package took about 2 weeks, fairly quick. The item is small, very petite size. I like this mist, you can use any time you feel dry and its refreshing, spray it into your skin and it absords immeditaely. There is no smell... but overall its just another item on the shelf, its nothing special and you could buy a much better mist or make one at home.</li>
    <li> omg this stuff smells amazing</li>
    <li> I love this product and the sellers! It came 2 weeks faster than expected which was an amazing surprise. It was very neatly packaged and even included cute samples in the box! It was bubble wrapped and came with bb cleanser packet and bb cream packet as well as a coupon!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, its wonderful! It worked wonders on my dry skin and smells very fresh and rejuvenating. The bottle is the size of my palm so its not that bad, definitely can be used for many many uses. I absolutely love everything about this purchase and will most definitely be buying from package_go_fast and Innisfree again!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could not be happier about this purchase. Definitely buy it! nothing to lose!</li>
    <li> Fairly cheap and fairly  SMALL too. Skin itches when you spray it at first and would get a little bit of redness on. But it smells super good. Personally dont belive it has all th natural ingredients as it says. Don&#x27;t feed your skin with cheap stuff, that&#x27;s all I got for buying this. Packaging was careful and thanks for the samples!!;)</li>
    <li> This is very refreshing! All you need is spritz this on your face when it&#x27;s too hot outside. I love the green tea scent too. I&#x27;m a sucker for natural products and I&#x27;m very happy with this one!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like Greentea at all. I tried it on my body and I had skin irritation. It didn&#x27;t get absorbed on my skin quickly and it&#x27;s sticky! I don&#x27;t even want to try it on my face. Sadly, it goes straight to the garbage can.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal user of the heritage rose water skin mist for years so I wanted to try something new. I use my mists all throughout the day especially in the summer to keep my skin hydrated and fresh and I felt this product did just that. My only complaint is that it ran out so much quicker than my rose water usually does. In the future I&#x27;ll order it in bulk.</li>
    <li> Good but too fast to run out. Suggest to buy larger size.</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast.&lt;br /&gt;Product smells so good!&lt;br /&gt;And really moisturizing and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t made my skin look oily at all.</li>
    <li> I have really been getting into the mist trend, and this one is quite nice, but there are a few issues. Overall I think it is an ok product, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again over other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;-Small size for travel or purse&lt;br /&gt;-Good ingredients for skin&lt;br /&gt;-The fragrance smells good, but I don&#x27;t like facial products that have fragrance in them since it causes breakouts for me&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t disturb makeup&lt;br /&gt;-Helps to rehydrate and refresh skin through out the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;-Fragrance is added to this product&lt;br /&gt;-The spray isn&#x27;t very even and you will get large droplets on your face that you need to dab into your skin.</li>
    <li> Small container, i was disappointed with it at first, but very quickly found myself using it all the time. i love it!</li>
    <li> It feels great going on, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling refreshed. The directions said you can use it before or even after you apply makeup, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed either times. It&#x27;s nice though. I&#x27;ll still use it and I might try their other kinds. It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
    <li> *Sensitive skin beware* I was really excited to try this but was pretty disappointed.. My skin never has a bad reaction to anything and this product made me break out everywhere on my face and gave me such a weird, rough skin texture. I used it for 2 days and had to stop.</li>
    <li> Shipped from Korea. I like the smell and the spray is great.</li>
    <li> I spray this over my makeup everyday. Doesn&#x27;t break me out. I really like it. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t in a can, it made me a little concerned that it was not natural at all and more processed but I was presently surprised at how nice and hydrated it made my face feel so it didn&#x27;t matter.</li>
    <li> Very light and pleasant mist! Like walking through a fog. Took off a star because my normal skin becomes very oily from this. I need to blot a few hours after. This would be perfect for wintertime.</li>
    <li> I love korean products, I always wated to get a mist. I think it didn&#x27;t work on me but still like it. It was refreshing just for few minutes, but i could smell the green tea :)</li>
    <li> I love how it is small. It&#x27;s perfect to put in my purse and I just spray some whenever i&#x27;m feeling hot outside. It keeps my face feeling fresh and moisturized on a hot summer day.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long but it hydrates your skin when you need a pick me up!</li>
    <li> I spray this on my face throughout the day to give my that &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling after sitting in a muggy classroom all day. Usually I get a few small pimples on my face here and there from the humidity in classrooms, but this product fix that. Now my face is clear  without random breakouts, and I even got some of my professors and classmates to try it out.</li>
    <li> causes a lot of breakouts.</li>
    <li> I really liked this mist. It was very moisturizing, it didn&#x27;t just wet my face and then dry, it left behind a light gel that helped replenish and retain moisture during the day. The only downside is that it didn&#x27;t last me very long and it&#x27;s hard to find. I&#x27;ll have to get the larger size next time.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have had this for a month now and it is just about gone. I used it two-3 times a day. smells great and if you get it on your lips the taste isn&#x27;t horrible!</li>
    <li> The smell is very good. Also, it is very moist. I use it right after i wash my face. I love this product! Hope you enjoy it.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing. I love spritzing this on my face when it&#x27;s too hot. It instantly refreshes my skin! Love it!</li>
    <li> Definitely provides great hydration to the face, but the scent can be a bit too much. It does kind of linger so if you don&#x27;t like floral/green tea scents then I&#x27;d pass on this. However, it does provide moisture to a dehydrated face and goes on over makeup without messing it up. I like how cooling it feels and it is a super fine mist so no worries about droplets of the product ending up on your face potentially ruining your makeup. Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll repurchase but I do enjoy it.</li>
    <li> I love this mist...very cooling and has a great fresh fragrance.</li>
    <li> It definitely moisturizes! I&#x27;ve been using it occasionally when my face feels too dry or too oily. It&#x27;s very refreshing~&lt;br /&gt;I also received several samples. Thank you so much for that! I love using them on the weekends!</li>
    <li> Green Tea has always been the best! &amp;#60;3 Fragrance is a bit strong so I don&#x27;t recommend it use in Summer.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, loved it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know what this mist does but I decided to try it. It is refreshing and has a nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> Very hydrating but smell is a bit too strong for me.</li>
    <li> use moisturizer if you need moisture, but this is a great topical refresher with a very light, clean scent that works like an aromatherapy pick-me-up.</li>
    <li> I got the larger size of this mist and I&#x27;m happy to report that I love it. I normally use La Roche Posay or Avene Thermal Water sprays, but I wanted to try something new this time. I&#x27;m glad I did, because I really enjoy the cooling sensation of Innisfree&#x27;s Green Tea Mist. It delivers more skin care benefits per spritz than just plain water. Great for prepping, priming, setting and re-hydrating-- all without any stickiness or oily feeling. The only thing I would change? Take away all trace of fragrance. It&#x27;s not an overwhelming scent and fades in minutes, though.</li>
    <li> I use this after I wash my face and it feels really refreshing and leaves my skin really soft, but other than that I don&#x27;t feel like it does anything else. I was worried at the beginning because my skin is really sensitive so I thought it would cause me some trouble but it didn&#x27;t, which is amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 3 weeks everyday and everything is perfectly fine. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> My first facial mist and I love it! I have oily-combo acne prone skin, and in the winter it gets pretty dry (maybe why I&#x27;m not breaking out as much?). Ever since I had this mist, I spray it before my moisturizer so the water droplets don&#x27;t escape as much. (If anyone knows the proper sequence of a skincare routine with a facial mist, please let me know!) My skin hasn&#x27;t broke out, and has definitely become more soft and moisturized. Just a warning, the size (50 mL) is a bit small, so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll last until summer, but we&#x27;ll see how it goes :)</li>
    <li> I wish I had gotten the bigger bottle! This stuff is really amazing, and has made my skin really smooth. It seeps in quickly and gives my skin a smooth feeling! Recommend!</li>
    <li> On my second can and its amazing !! I have s lovely glow when I put my makup on. Only problem is the 50ml finishes extremly fast if you choose to use it as a toner</li>
    <li> Broke me out. Very disappointed. If you have sensitive skin, do not buy.</li>
    <li> sticky feeling, when I put it on, all I want to do is to wash my face to put this off</li>
    <li> Love this product so much, it keeps your face hydrated and smells amazing.  I use this everyday and I feel so good after I put it on my face.</li>
    <li> So convenient to carry around! It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and it smells nice!</li>
    <li> Product is so refreshing and moisturizing! It also smells great but light so it won&#x27;t be bothersome. Wish they sold the larger size from a US seller so it would be delivered faster.</li>
    <li> I love this mist. The size is great for travel and is lovely to freshen your skin during long plane rides.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Nice pleasant smell and nice size to carry in your purse</li>
