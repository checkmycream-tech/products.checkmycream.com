<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love all the natural organic ingredients in this serum which is why I bought it.  Really does a great job of brightening up my complexion.  My new favorite Vitamin C serum!  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This worked amazingly well for both an easy case and a hard one.  It smoothed out the fine wrinkles that I had on my forehead and made my skin appear clear, healthy, and bright.  For my husband&#x27;s weather-beaten sun-aged skin, it greatly lessened the wrinkles, tightened his pores, and took about 10 years off of his appearance.  Although neither of us remembered to use it every day, the bottle lasted for more than a month with both of us using it.  It was a good investment and I am ordering it again.</li>
    <li> I rarely write product reviews, but I feel the need to let people know just how fantastic this product really is. At first it might seem too good to be true. This serum is just so inexpensive for all the claims it&#x27;s making. But they&#x27;re all 110% TRUE! I&#x27;ve been using this serum twice a day after cleansing and toning my face for the last two weeks and the results have been DRAMATIC. My skin, which was once dull, red, and flaky, absolutely GLOWS. It&#x27;s softer than I ever imagined it could be, and the tired lines below my eyes that I was BORN WITH have completely DISAPPEARED. I didn&#x27;t think it was possible! I&#x27;d been so used to seeing them that I did a double-take in the bathroom mirror when I realized they were gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive, acne-prone porcelain skin and this has done wonders to help heal old acne scars, soften my skin, and even out my skin tone without causing any irritation or break outs. This is a wonderful product and I plan on using it and recommending it to people for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.  I have sun damaged skin on my cheeks and nose and it feels like sandpaper after I wash my face until I apply this serum.  I am a senior - 82...and get many comments about how young my skin looks - am sure it&#x27;s partly the Vitamin C Serum.  Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> this thing really work</li>
    <li> This serum works great! I apply it on my face every night before bed. My skin feels clean and soft the next day. It gives my face equal tone, a youthful skin. The best part is the result can be seen immediately overnight.</li>
    <li> Big fan of this product. It is concentrated with a lot more vitamin C than most serums that compare to it, and it has really helped with my &amp;#34;I&#x27;m 30&amp;#34; aging issues. Dark spots are much less noticable, and I&#x27;m noticing a decrease in wrinkles as well!</li>
    <li> This has made my skin so smooth and soft.  People have asked me if I have been getting facials because my skin looks so much better.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Makes a real difference.</li>
    <li> I like the c serum. I use every morning.</li>
    <li> Bella Naturals is the BEST skin product I&#x27;ve ever used.  The Vitamin C serum is the best kept secret ever.  I use it twice a day.  Spray water on my face then rub the serum on my face and let it dry naturally.  I can actually feel my skin tighten.  It&#x27;s a miracle and won&#x27;t ever go without it.  Avoid a facelift.  Buy this product!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have tried tons of products to help rejuvenate and repair my skin, this is definatly one of my favorites. Helps with tone, texture, and overall health of skin. For the price, I feel like this item is a great deal!</li>
    <li> No matter how hard I tighten the cap, it works loose. Feel my product lost effectiveness due to constant exposure to air.</li>
    <li> I used this product and it made my skin very soft. I was using it in conjunction with another product with hopes that it would lighten dark spots but that did not happen.</li>
    <li> I am actually a sales Representative for a large well known skin cream and cosmetic company. Since I get a discount from their products, I usually buy them. After hearing about the results people have had using Vitamin C I decided to try it. The price was reasonable and I loved the fact it was organic. I have been using Bella Naturals for about 3 weeks and I can definitely see a difference. My skin tone is more even, it has reduced the fine lines and wrinkles and my face looks and feels firmer. Today at the dentist office, the receptionist asked me how old I will be as she saw that my birthday was 4 days away. She couldn&#x27;t believe it and pretty soon she was telling all the dental techs etc. and they were all swarming around me like a bee around honey. To say that really made me feel good would be an understatement. I would recommend this serum to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a skincare junkie and only use a few products, but this is the best weapon in my small arsenal!  I&#x27;ve only used it for about a month, and I love it.  It glides on nicely, absorbs beautifully, doesn&#x27;t smell, doesn&#x27;t leave a gross residue (maybe it could if you gob it on like Tammy Fay Bakker prepping for the prom) and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in my skin&#x27;s texture - very soft and smooth and with a nice glow.  I&#x27;ve also noticed a reduction in lines around my eyes, and the wrinkles I get above the bridge of my nose from furrowing my brow at annoying coworkers!  It&#x27;s a great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> I cannot say that I have seen noticeable benefits from this serum.  It is like water with a slight scent which is fine.If there are results, they are minimal.  Probably will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> After less than a week of using this product I noticed a definite difference in the fine line around my eyes and those horrid laugh lines.  I am still using this product three weeks later and while those particular lines have decreased, I don&#x27;t notice anymore  of a change.  I am very happy with the change I see and will update in another few weeks to see if there has been anymore change.</li>
    <li> I have been using vitamin C and hyaluronic acid serums for a while now, and this is one of the good ones! I have very fair skin, and I have had my share of sun damage over the years. Since I started using vitamin C serums with hyaluronic acid the skin on my face looks so much nicer! I had a friend show up unexpectedly a few weeks ago that caught me without my makeup on and she mentioned how nice my skin looked and asked me what I had been using. I though she was just being polite but later on that evening I took a closer look at my skin and noticed that the areas around my mouth and eyes were smoother and the skin tones were more even, I hadn&#x27;t really paid any attention until she mentioned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vitamin C in this serum works great to help heal your skin, while the hyaluronic acid helps to moisturize. The combination of the two along with other ingredients like rosehip oil, green tea extract, resistem (plant stem cells), and sea buckthorn oil can help sooth your skin and will help to reduce some of the finer lines and wrinkles. I have always felt it best to treat any fine lines and wrinkles early on helping to prevent them from becoming large lines and wrinkles. Since I have fair skin I burned and freckled easily when I was younger, now that I am older I notice areas showing up now that could have been prevented. Vitamin C serum does help lighten up some of the splotches and uneven skin tones. My skin tone is a lot more even than before and seems more supple too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use this serum you don&#x27;t have to use that much for it to work. Just clean your face and if you use a toner apply that and let dry. Then follow up with a few dots of this vitamin C serum and rub it into your skin. It absorbs very well and you will notice your skin will already feel softer, then just follow through with a light moisturizer. You can (and should) use the same treatment on your neck area as well as the back of your hands, since hands can also become sun damaged. I really love this stuff, I even put it on my husbands face and the backs of his hands while I apply it to mine since he is out in the sun most of the day. This is good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free product sample received in exchange for review purposes.uff, I even put it on my husbands face and the backs of his hands while I apply it to mine since he is out in the sun most of the day. This is good stuff!  Free product sample received in exchange for review purposes.</li>
    <li> Very easy to absorb, I have sensitive skin, this serum makes my skin very comfortable. Even though not long enough to see the results.</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C serum is great.  Not too thick and not too thin.  It has no odor, goes on smooth and dries very quickly.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> After using Naturalico® Vitamin C Serum on my face for about a week it is softer and feels firmer.  Tonight my husband told me my skin looked really soft and felt softer.  It is nice to have him notice that I am doing something different with my face.  I like how the small tiny lines around my mouth seem to be gone after only using Naturalico® Vitamin C Serum and I plan to continue to use it morning and night. I like it contains all natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacture provided me with a sample to use and review and this review reflects my honest results.</li>
    <li> I received a free bottle of Naturalico Vitamin C Serum to try and share my results about. First thing I would like to say is that I am African American. I make a point to note that because, often a lot of skincare products on the market, do not agree with our skin for one reason or another. Therefore, I am very careful about the products that I use on my skin. What intrigued me about this Vitamin C Serum was that it was made of almost 100 percent natural and organic ingredients. Therefore, I decided to give it a try. The shipping and delivery process was seamless. I received it a few days after placing my order. The instructions on the packaging states to shake the bottle well before each use to ensure all the natural ingredients were well blended. The serum, which comes with a syringe applicator, which makes it rather easy to get just a small amount as needed for the face and neck area. I used the serum before bed on a cleansed face, and neck area. The consistency of the liquid itself is a little oily, but not greasy or thick. A tiny drop goes a long way. Once applied to the face, you feel an instant tightening of the face as it the serum air dries. I put my own moisturizer on right after ( I use coconut oil ). My face immediately feels really clean and glows nicely. I have been using Naturalico Vitamin C for about a month now, and the overall results to my skin have been really good.  I see just a glow in my face that previously was not there. My complexion is very pleasing to me. Although it is winter, and usually my skin this time of year is dull, it is really bright and life-like. I love it. Also, the other night my husband paid me a compliment about how beautiful my skin was looking and this guy doesn’t ever pay attention to stuff like that! I am excited to see how much better my skin will get after a few months of using this product.  Also this tiny bottle will last me at least 3 months, because like I mentions a little goes a long way. I hope Bella Naturalcontinues to offer this Vitamin C Serum, because to me, it is one of the best on the market. I really see the benefit of Vitamin C.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a week so far and have noticed a big improvement in my skin.  There&#x27;s a glow and a tightness that is not normally there.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews, I was really hoping to notice even a small improvement so I am sorry to say that I haven’t.  But I did buy 3 bottles so I will keep trying. It does feel good after putting on, and it&#x27;s only been about 3 weeks so maybe it just takes longer.</li>
    <li> wonderful ,powerful product</li>
    <li> Pretty awesome serum and it&#x27;s vegan friendly! I use it under my moisturizer and you can really tell the difference when you use this. I also use konjac sponges to cleanse my skin before I put this on. The combination is a winner.</li>
    <li> This product was amazing!! I was looking for something that was natural, that had Vitamin C, Aloe and Jojoba...This has it all and is the all-in-one, one step process that you can apply any time of the day--won&#x27;t dry out your skin, won&#x27;t leave you oily, doesn&#x27;t leave your face stuck to the pillow at night and won&#x27;t ruin your makeup application in the mornings. MUST HAVE! No, I don&#x27;t sell for them ;) Best part: IT&amp;#34;S AFFORDABLE AND SAFE</li>
    <li> I love the Naturalico serum!  It&#x27;s dries quickly and I like the consistency of the serum. I&#x27;ve used it for a week and I already notice an improvement in my skin texture.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen huge improvement, but I&#x27;m guessing this isn&#x27;t something you are going to see results from overnight. Will continue using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of vitamin C serums in the past year. This is one of the least expensive and would be a good entry into the market. I&#x27;m happy that this one comes in a brown glass bottle to block some light. I&#x27;m less thrilled that this come with an eye dropper, which is one of the messiest forms of serum application in my opinion (not to mention it&#x27;s not airtight -- protecting against light and air are going to extend the shelf life of products such as these).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is thin and a bit runny. However, it is super easy to spread and absorbs into the skin quickly without leaving any residue. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for a little over a week and it has not yet caused any irritation. (Usually if something is going to bother me, it would have before now.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this contains sea buckthorn; I&#x27;ve increasingly seen this ingredient in a lot of preparations for the skin. It contains a ton of antioxidants which should help reduce free radical damage from the sun (it doesn&#x27;t substitute for a good SPF product, but would work really well in combination with one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was having a breakout from switching skincare products a lot lately and I think using this has helped heal my skin and reduce redness, so definite bonus points for that. (Please note that sometimes within a few days of using a new product, your skin will break out. This is not necessarily the fault of the new product because often breakouts and acne are forming deep in the skin, well in advance of their eventual appearance on the surface. I was tempted to blame this product at first, too, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t, because my breakout is now going away -- it&#x27;s not sustained even as I keep using this, though I think it would continue if this product was actually causing the issue. I&#x27;m pretty sure the breakout was due to something else (oil-based) that I was using before and that this was merely speeding the healing process.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that this is vegan, so the hyaluronic acid must come from a plant or bacterial source. Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide (long chain carbohydrate) that hangs on to a lot of water molecules. This can help reduce the appearance of fine lines and it&#x27;s also really moisturizing. I would definitely say my skin has been moisturized since using this. Also, my fine lines have been kept in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serums are traditionally used after cleanser and toner, but before moisturizer. This order of application has been working for me. I also use SPF, primer, and foundation in the morning and this does not interfere with any of those products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I&#x27;m right in the target age group for this. I&#x27;m 37 and stay out of the sun, but I am still worried about fine lines and wrinkles. And, unfortunately, I&#x27;m still prone to breakouts. With this, I can get the moisturizing and anti-aging effects of hyaluronic acid and the breakout-healing effects of vitamin C, sea buckthorn, etc., as well as a bit of additional protection from free-radical damage due to the included antioxidants. Definitely glad I tried this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.d must come from a plant or bacterial source.

    <li> This anti-aging product seems to have worked for me. After using it for several weeks, after cleaning my face in the morning and evening, there is clear visual improvement of my face. Fine lines disappeared. Only a small amount of the liquid is needed. It gets absorbed quickly in the skin. There is no oily feeling. Following the application with a good moisturizer is the ideal way to get good results. I enjoyed using the product and the good results.</li>
    <li> Great product! It helps brighten my face and improve my skin tone.</li>
    <li> This serum is more like applying water! It is exrremely thin and has no scent. I can&#x27;t  believe this is a serum!? I have been using it for a week and have noticed zero difference! Definitely dissatisfied</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the results so far. I tried the serum on my &amp;#34;old lady hands&amp;#34; and it is apparent that my hands actually look younger. I haven&#x27;t noticed as much a difference on my face but, it definitely tightens up my entire face kind of like a mini face lift. I have only used this product for 1 week so I believe the best is yet to come. The quantity of serum in the bottle is amazing!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful serum. When I saw the Hyaluronic acid listed on the ingredients, I was a bit nervous as I have sensitive skin and I have had bad luck with acid products in the past. Not so with this amazing serum. The serum is a nice consistency and is odorless and goes on smoothly and easily. There is no burning before, during or after. In fact, my skin felt soft and moist for a few hours afterwards with no greasy feeling. I used this on my face and neck consistently for ten days and I did notice a difference in firmness and moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am becoming a fan of serums as skin care and this is once of the nicest I have tried - beautiful results and great consistency and ease of use - not too watery, not too thick and does make the skin look younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: This serum is truly amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it every other day for almost five weeks after my ten day intensive introduction and my skin and face genuinely look younger. My skin is bright and smooth and well, just younger. It&#x27;s taken more than half a decade off my face. I&#x27;m giving the ultimate endorsement. I was sent this bottle for review, but I will buy my own bottle once this one is empty. Truly a wonderful serum.</li>
    <li> I use this serum every morning and again after coming in from the sun. It just melts in and keeps my face clear with no sun damage. I will buy it again. Thanks</li>
    <li> Love it!  My skin feels great using this product underneath my moisturizer</li>
    <li> So far this product DOES NOT meet my expectations. I ordered it based on the many good reviews that it received. I had hoped that it would help with skin discoloration, however it makes my skin EXTREMELY dry, even when using a moisturizer. I am breaking out with pimples, which I have not had in about thirty years, LITERALLY. I am rating this product a two for the mostly organic ingredients.. nothing more.  I recently received an email from Grace of Bella Naturals apologizing for my disappointment with the product and offering a refund if I call them. I left a message over a week ago and heard nothing. No &amp;#34;amazing Grace&amp;#34; from this vendor!</li>
    <li> I used vitamin C serum on my face for 2 weeks and for the first time in my life I can say that I noticed a difference in my skin. It appears firmer, fine wrinkles and my spots have faded. I&#x27;m 60 years old and have tried numerous products in the past...  this is the first one that truly works (or my sight&#x27;s declining ;-)</li>
    <li> This product has been helping my skin. Goes on smooth and no breakouts from it. Haven&#x27;t seen that much of a difference yet, but that&#x27;s bc I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a couple of weeks. Just wanted to point out that this company is family run and seems top notch in terms of customer service. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product after doing a lot of research on Vitamin C serums. So far so good!</li>
    <li> Naturalico Vitamin C has proven to give my skin a freshness that goes beyond other topical treatments that I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve recently started exfoliating my skin on a regular basis with excellent results. To this, I have also added this product. I am not bragging, but stating a fact. The appearance of my skin has changed greatly for the better. For the first time in quite a long time, I can actually leave the house without foundation, concealer, blush and powder. I have actually gone to work with just a touch of powder on my T-zone, and nobody ran screaming from the room! :) Amazingly -- I did not cringe with embarrassment when looking in the mirror in the ladies&#x27; room. Is it boasting to say that I think I look a bit younger? Well, in my humble opinion, I actually do. Most definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Seems to tighten some on my face.</li>
    <li> Decent product, helping absorption of my daily creams. Light weight and absorbs easily. See my full post for how to choose Vitamin C serums and the full review: http://www.whirlwindofsurprises.com/2015/01/NaturalicoR.html</li>
    <li> Received this product about 2 weeks ago and started using it right away.  This is the second product of this kind that I have tried and I definitely like this one better.  It&#x27;s much easier to apply (the consistency of the other one was too thin).  This is not oily at all and it absorbs into the skin quickly.  Skin feels very smooth in a minute or so.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT, FAST DELIVERY, GOOD PRICE AND FEELS WONDERFUL ON MY SKIN.</li>
    <li> I have used several types of lotions, serums and creams on my face; I have to say that I am impressed with this serum.  I have actually noticed a healthily sheen to my facial skin since using it over a couple weeks.  Additionally, I recently returned home from a sunny vacation during which I received a good bit of sun on my forehead and face.  I noticed my forehead was beginning to peel.  After just one application of this serum, all signs of peeling or damage disappeared, and the skin looks healthy and whole.  That really surprised me and impressed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that users of this serum can be confident both in its quality ingredients and its benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this as a promotional product and am thoroughly impressed.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! It makes my skin soft and glowy!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help treat my stubborn dark spots, and I was amazed by how quickly they lightened up. I also like how it doesn&#x27;t make my face look greasy and it absorbs into my skin very quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C serums for a year or two now, and love the way they keep my face hydrated and even combat and reverse sun damage.  I spend a lot of time outdoors (with sunscreen) because of our sons&#x27; baseball and football, and I never forget to use Vitamin C after a weekend in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also try to keep the products I use on my body and the foods I eat as natural as possible.  I buy organic whenever I can, and love it when I find a natural/organic product that really works.  This Bella Naturals 20% Vitamin C serum is one of the best products I&#x27;ve found for helping my middle aged skin look it&#x27;s best.  It&#x27;s full of beneficial ingredients such as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  Vitamin C (encourages collagen production and healing of damaged skin, reverses UV damage from the sun)&lt;br /&gt;-  Organic rosehip oil/Vitmain E (rehydrates skin, moisturizes, prevents skin damage)&lt;br /&gt;-  Green tea extract (fights skin cancer, decreases acne breakouts, soothes irritation)&lt;br /&gt;-  Sea buckthorn oil (antioxidant, helps rosacea, combats acne, encourages healing)&lt;br /&gt;-  Vegan Hyaluronic acid (seals in moisture, helps generate collagen to reduce wrinkles)&lt;br /&gt;-  Plant stem cells (repairs cellular damage from UV exposure, encourages healing,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum comes in a dark glass bottle, which prevents the product breaking down with exposure to sunlight, and is applied with a glass dropper.  The clear liquid soaks in quickly and leaves my skin smooth and moist without feeling greasy.  I apply it twice a day after washing my face, and I am very pleased with the way it makes my skin feel healthier.  Is it a miracle cure for aging?  No - time and gravity can be slowed down but not stopped.  But does it improve the signs of aging and sun damage - absolutely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary bottle of Bella Naturals serum for testing and review purposes. I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I compensated in any way for giving my honest opinion of the product.  Look at the hundreds of reviews I&#x27;ve written over ten years and you&#x27;ll see that I always give an honest opinion of the products I review.over ten years and you&#x27;ll see that I always give an honest opinion of the products I review.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good. I&#x27;m still using it so it&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t often have much to say but this the first time I&#x27;ve been this mad. Do not buy this! It has a strange odor, felt sticky after I applied it, and made me break out. I had no acne at all and the day after I used this I had little bumps all over my face. I’ve used other brands c serums before and this has never happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reasons I bought this was because of all the glowing reviews. That got me thinking that something has to be off about those reviews. Well I looked closer at them and there are a ton of reviews that are unverified and it’s the only review that person has ever done. I’m convinced these are fake. Many of the other reviews were left by people who got it free, and I don&#x27;t know if I can trust those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend looking for a different brand that’s more reliable. This one is a total waste of money and the reviews can’t be trusted.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any change after few weeks ,  started using jeunesse instead .</li>
    <li> I been using this product for two weeks now.. and i love it..you could see a big difference in the skin texture..my skin looks lighter and brighter..i don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet..but i wanna prevent them by using this product..so far i really liked it..;)</li>
    <li> Excellent quantity and texture.</li>
    <li> On the thin side of the serum spectrum but performs well: fast absorb, moisturizing, non-greasy, light pleasant smell, long lasting, non irritating.  Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Great product. My skin is clearer and much smoother. After the easiily application my skin feels firmer. Its very light but i&#x27;m not a fan of the dropper, I wish it was a pump serum.</li>
    <li> This does just what it is suppose to do without charging the high prices that major company&#x27;s I use it morning and night and can see a difference.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two bottles of this vitamin C serum.  I have sun damage on my face and I do feel the serum is helping with those troubled areas.  I have very sensitive and delicate skin and this product has not caused any adverse reactions or dryness.  Great serum.</li>
    <li> The results I seen in two weeks of use has been amazing. My husband is now using this too since he noticed such a difference in my skin, a real healthy look. The serum feels good when you put it on and does not make your face feel greasy.</li>
    <li> For me, I have tested and tried out several Vitamin C and Vitamin E Serums and they were somewhat sticky and not the easiest to use. This serum is different and I really like the best because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It has an easy measure dropper with measurement lines on it. For me, I use the first one as I use this serum under my eyes (the driest part on my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Easy to apply - I place the drop on my finger and rub it into my eye area. No stickiness or tackiness! In fact once I have applied this, I apply my undereye concealer and I am good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Looks and feels natural - I use this before I apply makeup and at night after I was my face. This way my undereye area is soft and supple the next day and when I re-apply, my undereye area looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) I also tried this on my forehead and it made my forehead lines look less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum was provided to me for the purpose of testing and reviewing. And after testing this, I rate this a full five stars with no hesitation. In fact, I very much recommend it to others!</li>
    <li> From my wife Sarah: I&#x27;ve had excellent results with this product. Here&#x27;s what I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s reduced the appearance of some broken blood vessels I have under my skin. That&#x27;s amazing! There&#x27;s no way to do this that I know about, other than laser surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- My skin appears smoother and my pores smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- There appears to be no added fragrances. There&#x27;s a very, very slight smell, It&#x27;s so slight that I don&#x27;t notice it when I&#x27;m putting on the product, and I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrances. I suspect the very slight fragrance comes from the herbs included in the mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s full of natural ingredients. In addition to the vitamin C, E and hyaluronic acid, it&#x27;s got ingredients like aloe leaf, Japanese green tea, Sea buckthorn oil, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I contacted the manufacturer and they say it&#x27;s a gluten free product. For people with gluten sensitivity or celiac, it&#x27;s important to watch what you put around your mouth and face so you don&#x27;t ingest even small traces of gluten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to shake the bottle as the natural ingredients separate. I apply this after washing my face. It only takes 2-3 drops, so the bottle lasts a long time. Give it a moment to absorb and then you can then put your moisturizer over the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not for use around your eyes. The directions say to avoid the eye area.</li>
    <li> This product works really good. I was using a different brand of vitamin C product before, but I like this one better. I am almost finished my first bottle and just ordered 2 more. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> My skin is brighter, and dry patches are going away, and I&#x27;m 60 yrs. old!</li>
    <li> Very good product. I will order again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a month now and I will recommend.  This serum is light weight and refreshing leaving the skin feeling soft.  I use it twice a day and I can tell my skin is more hydrated, and feels healthier.  Don’t expect results over night, it might take a couple months depending on each individual, but it is definitely worth the try.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and my skin seems to be brighter already. I&#x27;ve been using it on my hands as well as my face and my hands seem less dry, in general. I really like that it&#x27;s not greasy and has natural ingredients, as well. I am eager to see the results when I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week and a half and I love it!! My skin feels tighter and softer!! I definitely recommend!!!</li>
    <li> Was disappointed ,I have been using it for around two weeks and I don&#x27;t notice any difference</li>
    <li> After a week my face is smoother and glows. Perfect for my combination skin. My acne scars have begun to fade too.</li>
    <li> After reading about the benefits of Vitamin C serum in Allure, I wanted it pronto. Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t find anything locally that wasn&#x27;t insanely expensive (my beauty-junkie side battles with my frugal accountant side constantly). So, as always, I went to Amazon and found this brand. Organic - wonderful! Includes Vitamin E and hyaluronic acid - perfect! The article I read stated that, for best results and maximum anti-oxidant, free radical fighting capabilities, the C needed to be paired with these two. And the price? On point. I&#x27;ve been using it at night under my heavy-duty moisturizer. It goes on smoothly, glides easily over the skin, soaks in quickly, and I have definitely noticed a much smother texture to my skin since using it the last few weeks. For the price, the ingredients, the quality, and the results? Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and how it makes my face feel. Refreshing and tighting</li>
    <li> Love this product, i have been using it for a few days and i see my face more luminous and silky... It has a smell but i like it.</li>
    <li> I have personally used a few Vitamin C serums (hey, older dudes, it&#x27;s okay to want to get rid of those under-eye saggies!), and they all worked well enough once you are willing to put in time.  A couple previous seemed to give more immediate effects than others, yet in my book, it is all about the long-term epidermis treatment.  This one by Bella Naturals is really no different, except in two ways that pops this up as a 5 star consideration:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price.  It&#x27;s definitely economical.  Now I personally don&#x27;t normally allow pricing to directly on overall evaluations, simply because what is worth to me may not be to you, and vice versa.  However, this is on the lower end of the price scale, and it does work - just not quite a quick as a couple others that were also about twice the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic.  I definitely prefer organic options when available - just nice to support pesticide free use (as well knowing there isn&#x27;t any crazy growth-targeted GMO hijinks being used... hey, it happens).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note, this does contain Witch Hazel (Hamamelis Virginia), so those with particularly sensitive skin to any form of astringents, you may not want to use this formulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- I received this as a complimentary review supplement.  I am a life long herbal supplement taker with strong interests both in the medicinal traditions and modern pharmacological aspects of Earth&#x27;s Natural Bounties.</li>
    <li> great serum to put under moisturizer and great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this serum a couple of times, but I&#x27;m impressed by the instant tightening effects and how smooth my skin looks afterwards. I really like that there is no tingling or burning sensation...I have sensitive skin and have used it after microneedling with no sensitivity. I can&#x27;t wait to see more results as time continues!</li>
    <li> I purchased this serum to use in combination with a derma roller. When applying it right after rolling, there is a little bit of burning for a few minutes. Over the following few days, I notice a little bit if peeling and some sensitivity, which quickly becomes wonderful smoothness! I have only been using the vitamin c serum for a few weeks, but I like what it does for my skin and that I can wear it under makeup without a sticky feeling. I will keep using!</li>
    <li> This product is very interesting to me because I am very skeptical of these kinds of products. So, when I received it, rather than just start using it, I decided to apply it only to the back of one hand. Pleased to report that after a week, I indeed could see a difference. It does &#x27;brighten&#x27; the skin and lighten age spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried it on my elbows. It worked wonders on my dry cracked elbow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must say that I was a skeptic but now see benefit in both healing and regeneration with use of this product. Don&#x27;t expect miracles but it does work. For rough patches, it works especially well. By the way, I refused to review this product until I was convinced it worked or didn&#x27;t. It does.</li>
    <li> A little too thick, like someone else had written.  I should have paid attention!  Don&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;t order if you have oily skin!!</li>
    <li> Very light. A little goes a long way. Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel to skin. Can be added to other moisturizer such as retinol. Does not make foundation feel oily. Skin seems to heal faster. Does not cause breakouts and I break out easily. If you are allergic to vitamin C or E. Do not use.</li>
    <li> I currently just began with this product.  It applies easily and spreads quickly.  I am beginning to see some changes in the lines on my face I have read the value  of Vitamin C and Vitamin on the face.  Time will tell but I am willing to give it a shot and see what happens.  I have very sensitive skin and with most products either break out or burning occurs.  I did not experience any of that.  May be on to something here....</li>
    <li> Vita. C is one of the best vitamins for skin. I use mine in the morning because the sun does not effect it.  The other great thing is that once you put it on it stays on until you wash it off.  All the while working to keep your skin youthful, glowing and supple.  I highly recommend this to women and men too. It really works.</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase of Organic Vitamin C Serum. Use it twice a day, love it!</li>
    <li> My spouse and I have both had good results with this product. It&#x27;s easy to use and affordable, too.</li>
    <li> I love Vitamin C serum! It was recommended to me by a skincare professional.  I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now.  It smooths the skin and adds moisture. I&#x27;m glad to add this to my skincare routine!</li>
    <li> The past 2 weeks I&#x27;ve suffered utter embarrassment as a huge rash engulfed the side of my neck then spread to my ear and face - during the holidays! Everything I tried seemingly made things worse. From allergy creams to hydrocortisone,  triple antibiotic to anti-fungal creams, even Rx silver burn cream left over from a serious burn,  nothing helped. Each application was noticeably larger than the previous. I was utterly embarrassed after one of our doctors freaked out. I&#x27;ve been boosting my vitamin D levels,  it seemed to calm the worst of the storm from spreading further but my skin was still horrific looking. :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a whim I started applying this anti-aging serum. At first I was afraid I&#x27;d made a huge mistake, sensations flared up through the scaly patch..  Not pain..  Not burning..  Sort of a tingling sensation..  Almost knitting like. Seriously each application,  every few hours,  it slmost feels like tiny little knitting needles are delicately patching my skin back together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a few hours small areas of scaly skin around the edges began flaking off,  revealing smooth healthy skin underneath. Every few hours more flakes away gently then I reapply.  Each time that tiny knitting feeling returns. In less than 24 hours this huge patch of red,  scaly,  oozing rash has utterly reversed course and is vanishing literally before my eyes.  My husband commented after we went out for dinner with friends last night,  he couldn&#x27;t believe the vast improvement in the few hours since he&#x27;d looked at it closely before we left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using this serum on the rest of my face. A few acne spots cleared right up and the big one is mostly healed - in 24 hours! I&#x27;m in my 40s, I&#x27;ve been battling acne since I was 7 years old.  I&#x27;ve *never* seen this rapid improvement ever before. Ever. In 35 or so years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best yet - the ingredients are natural oils and plant extracts.  Aloe.  Vitamin C. Vitamin E. Green tea. Sea Buckthorn. Gotu kola. Dandelion. Rose hip oil. Geranium. Jojoba oil. I avoid chemicals,  this serum fits right into my preference for natural products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle was provided to me complimentary for reviewing purposes. This is my honest experience with this vitamin C skin serum. I fully intend to purchase another bottle as this first bottle runs low! 5+ stars. I&#x27;ve already shared this product listing to my friends,  it&#x27;s really that good.Dandelion. Rose hip oil. Geranium. Jojoba oil.

    <li> I am in love with this product.  It is in an oil form and you don&#x27;t need a lot.  I wash my face and then put this on, once it is absorbed I add my moisturizer.  I do notice a different in my skin and have gotten compliments on my skin since I started using this.  I also use this on my elbows and where I have some very dry skin and it help s to clear that up.  No more itchy dry skin, it is like vitamins for dryness.  I love it and would recommend this to anyone living in a dry climate or with over dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this now for a couple of weeks and can honestly say my skin is improving.  This Winter raised havoc on my skin.  This serum has revitalized my skin and is taking care of the dry spots.  Nice product!</li>
    <li> After a month of use I see very little improvement. I would probably see the same with only the hydrating cream. However it is still too early to tell.</li>
    <li> i am very pleased with this product. my skin drinks it up like a drink in the summertime.</li>
    <li> It goes on smoothly w/o any smell, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  It also has a dropper, instead of a pump, so the bottle doesn&#x27;t leak like others I&#x27;ve tried.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Really good product ,loved it</li>
    <li> It is really easy to apply and it looks like, after using it for months that it helped my skin a little bit. I have wrinkles and some of them seems to be a little bit smaller. The skin feels really soft and fresh. I do have to apply face cream afterwards because the skin feels a little bit dry afterwards. I can recommend it</li>
    <li> Love it. Very good product and fast delivery. Recommend.</li>
    <li> My skin is looking brighter and feels softer after 1 week of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;I usually apply it first on a dried skin after face wash.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product and I can immediately see the improvement,  I&#x27;m 44 yrs old and this makes me look so much younger people tell me I look way younger.</li>
    <li> I like it-but can&#x27;t tell if it did anything in the 4 months I used it-but who knows?</li>
    <li> Let me start out saying that I have tried a lot of Vitamin C serums from Amazion and other sites. Some bad some just ok and some good. This serum falls into the good category, one that I would buy again. It does just what it said it would do,at least for me it did. My skin is very soft and brighter then when not using it. I have occasional acne one or two on chin and or cheek. When using the serum they dissappear much faster and they don&#x27;t seem to return fast either. The serum is thin like water so you have to work fast in putting it on but that&#x27;s good because it&#x27;s not sitting on your skin forever. Lines on forehead have decreased and so have the lines above my nose. It&#x27;s been almost a month and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I apply it with E oil and together they are perfect ! They clear and smooth my skin , I difenetly recommend it</li>
    <li> When I first used the NaturaliCo Serum I noticed that it has a watery consistency. I’m used to serums with a thicker consistency, but after I applied the NaturaliCo Serum on my face, my skin instantly felt hydrated. I really like that the NaturaliCo Vitamin C Serum absorbs quickly into the skin. The NaturaliCo Vitamin C Serum is not greasy, and doesn’t have a scent which I think is great for anyone that is sensitive to fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of weeks of using the NaturaliCo Serum I noticed that my skin looks brighter, and feels firmer. My husband also notices a difference, and loves the way my face feels. At first, the only difference I saw was hydrated skin, but now my skin is firm, and even my laugh lines are less visible.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received these products for free to review. The opinions in my review are honest and my own.</li>
    <li> When This Serum Came, It Was Packaged Very Well In A Matching Box Just Like The Bottle, The Bottle It&#x27;s Self Is Glass So, Is The dripper It Came With, This Let’s You Control How Much You Want To Use, Which I Love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Naturalico Organic Vitamin C Serum, Contains 20% Vitamin C, Vitamin E And Hyaluronic Acid, This Serum Is Made From 98% Pure Natural Ingredients And 72% Of The Ingredients Are Certified As Organic Also The Serum Has No Scent At All.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m A Fan Of Using Serums And Essential Oils And Such And I&#x27;m Glad I Was Given The Chance To Test Naturalico Organic Vitamin C Serum Out, It Absorbs Really Fast Into My Skin And After Using This Product For About A Week Or So Now, I&#x27;ve Noticed That My Skin Is Softer And Brighter Looking. I&#x27;m Happy Not Just With The Results I&#x27;m Seeing, But Also With The Product Itself.  The Serum Is Easy To Apply, It Isn&#x27;t Sticky Or Gross To Put On. It Soaks Into My Skin And Dries Quickly. I Apply Both My Moisturizer And Makeup As Usual, And I Haven&#x27;t Witnessed Any Clumping Or Running (As That Can Be The Norm With Other Serums.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Recommend This Product To Anyone Who Wants To Start Using An Anti-Aging Product That Actually Works. I Will Keep Using It Until It&#x27;s Gone, This Is So Much More Than An Anti-Aging Product. This Serum Claims To Vevive Dull Skin, Reduce Discoloration, Softens Lines &amp; Wrinkles Gently, Firms Skin, And Also Protects. Which I Have Seen First Hand With My Own Results. Plus Side This Product Is Made In The Good Old USA!</li>
    <li> As of right now, I like it.  It makes my skin feel nice and smooth.  As far as seeing results, I think it is too early to tell.  I have only been using it for about a week and a half.  I am very appreciative of the sale going on and the fabulous price.  If it continues to stay the same affordable price, I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for almost a week and love how a little goes a long way! It just glides right on and absorbs quickly so I can get on with the rest of my skin regimen. Key ingredients all in one bottle(hyluronic acid, green tea, vitamin C....), now that&#x27;s a complete anti-aging serum.</li>
    <li> I purchased this vitamin C serum for my face and have been using it regularly. I find that my fine lines are less visible around my eyes and my skin looks overall healthier and has a nice glow. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST serum i have used!  I used a Vitamin C Serum from another company and was not impressed.  This one is more silky and just feels clean on your skin.  My skin has a glow and some dark spots are starting to lighten up.  HIGHLY advise you to buy this product!</li>
    <li> So far I have liked this but have not used it often.  I have so many other products that I am trying to use up and then I will use it more. I like Vit C anything and exlpect it to be great.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this Vitamin C Serum!  I have been using it for almost 5 months now.  I saw some results when I first started using it but my skin just keeps improving over time.  I didn&#x27;t really have a lot of problems with my skin before, but hitting my 60&#x27;s thought it could use some help.  My skin feels so much softer and healthier.  I get comments from people saying how nice my skin looks.  I hope they never stop making this serum!</li>
    <li> So far I love this product. I have only been using it a short time but I love the consistency and my skin has not reacted adversely to the vitamin C. In the past I would experience immediate break outs after using products claiming to contain vitamin C. And who can beat the price :)&lt;br /&gt;Tangelia Moore!!</li>
    <li> This is going to be a staple in my skin care routine. I apply this at night as follows: wash face -&amp;#62;toner--&amp;#62;serum --&amp;#62;moisturizer. Works so well that I don&#x27;t use bb cream in the morning anymore.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 5 months. It does not irritate my sensitive skin and I am using this as my primer. It works so much better than my expensive primer did. I have been in a rush in the AM and have forgotten to apply the serum and my makeup doesn&#x27;t go on the same or feel quite right. It goes on smoothly and dries quickly. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This product dried out my cheeks. Can only use on my t zone area. Sensitive skin buyers use caution.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff !!! I have been using this product for about a month. It has made a huge difference in the appearance of my skin. My skin is much softer, and brighter. My pores are much smaller now too. I had acne scars in one area of my jaw line. It has almost faded way since I started using the vitamin C. I have only used Bella Naturals brand so I can&#x27;t speak on any others. I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> This serum has dramatically changed my face. I&#x27;m 36. Tried everything. Don&#x27;t like spending a ton for nothing. As soon as I use this , it tightens the face.. My husband always comments!!! However my acne that appears during menstruation has completely ceased since using the product. Been using for a few months! And it&#x27;s a great price!! Buy it!! Use a toner before, serum, then moisturizer..people think I&#x27;m 10 years younger than I am😉</li>
    <li> I purchased this serum and have been using morning and evening and I absolutely love it....</li>
    <li> Good product , good for skin , thank you !!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and almost through with one bottle. I will be ordering another bottle. I had a few forehead wrinkles and dry facial skin before starting this product. After using for a little over a 2 months, I&#x27;ve noticed that my forehead lines have diminished in size and skin is more supple. Absorbs into skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t require a lot of product to coat my face.</li>
    <li> This serum was at a great price and I have been reading how good vitamin c is for your skin. I have used it for about a week now and it feels great. It&#x27;s lightweight and you can feel it tightening a little. It&#x27;s to soon to see results but I am hopeful from the other reviews that I will see some good results soon!</li>
    <li> This Vitamin C Serum was sent to me for review and I was so excited to receive it. I have very dry rough skin on my cheeks and under my eyes during the winter months and I havent ever found a product that works as good as this one. I have tried many topical ointments, creams, and lotions for my face, but the Vitamin C Serum is best thus far.The smell is very light and pleasant. It absorbed immediately into the skin, and leaves my skin feeling fresh and soft. I love this Vitamin C Serum and will be getting more as soon as I run out!</li>
    <li> Really nice product. My skin feels and looks better. The serum is super easy to apply. After a few weeks I can see that the skin tone is more even and my skin feels softer. Love it!</li>
    <li> I really like it, im so  glad I ordered it!</li>
    <li> I am going day 4 of using this serum and I absolutely love the way it feels. I can already see a difference in my skin. It feels rejuvenated! I cannot wait to see what using this long term does for my skin.</li>
    <li> Have not noticed a change yet.</li>
    <li> has helped with fine lines and dark spots .</li>
    <li> I have only used it for 3 days so far. Seems to go on smoothly.</li>
    <li> It was ok for a while then it started to smell funny so I stopped using it , I&#x27;m not sure if I was supposed to use it in a specific amount time after opening but it started to smell differently.</li>
    <li> At first it itch my face and I think it was because of the 20% vitamin c so I mixed it with a little bit of coconut  oil n it stopped.  It is a very good product. Skin feels softer and brighter</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first about this product, since i tried different products to even my skin tone around the cheekbone area with no luck.  I read the reviews and decided to give a try since its organic, so far so good i been using it for a few months now and am on my second bottle already.  I will keep you posted in a few months with before and after pictures.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product for the first time and I am very happy with the results so far.  It absorbs easily and a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve noticed my pores are smaller as a result.</li>
    <li> JUST STARTED USING  MY SKIN FEELS SMOOTHER</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I decided to try vitamin C at the advice of my dermatologist and this was the first one I tried.  I have used it for a month and I definitely see and difference in my skin and have had compliments on how my skin looks that I have never had to before.  I plan to continue using this.</li>
    <li> the best vitamin c serum i have ever used on my extremely sensitive skin- thank you!</li>
    <li> I used this product or about a month.  I can tell it does make a difference on my skin.  My face gets smoother and softer!  Love it! I will keep using it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for about a week now. I haven&#x27;t seen a huge change in my skin yet but it does look a little brighter and smoother.</li>
    <li> Been using this for a couple weeks and I see no difference except that it broke out my once clear skin I will be discontinuing use. Be careful if you have sensitive skin!!</li>
    <li> When having a facial, I was told how good vitamin C was for skin.  It&#x27;s true!  My skin feels firm and smooth.  Perhaps less wrinkles--hard to tell after only 1/2 bottle.  I will continue to use because I like the feeling and know I&#x27;m doing something good for my skin--it&#x27;s about time!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I just started derma rolling not too long ago and I was in need of a good serum for after the treatment. I just love how you can literally feel your skin absorb this stuff in. It&#x27;s amazing! I usually put this on right after I&#x27;m done using the derma roller. At first I was afraid that it would sting because I&#x27;ve just got done putting puncture holes all over my face, but it does not sting at all. Thats just awesome!! And to top it off, its all organic! This product works really well for me, especially side by side with derma rolling...be patient and you will see a difference. I can already tell that the lines on my face is starting to smooth out. The tiny scar on my left cheek is almost gone! Just amazing! I will continue to use this product as it works greatly for me. I hope it does for you too!</li>
    <li> Love it makes my skin so soft and fine lines are diminished.</li>
    <li> My wife has acne problem in her face, we tried various products but no use. I read about this Vitamin C Serum when i was ordering Roller then we order it after reading lot of reviews. My wife has been using 1 month and i can say 70% of her acne problem gone and i can see significant glow in her face. She is super happy and excited. Dont expect results over the night. She apply alvera gel after this one for best results. use it for night for best results.</li>
    <li> I used to use JJ Labs Skin Solutions Vitamin C Serum which I really liked. When I ran out I saw the reviews for Naturalico and, considering the lower cost, I thought I would give it a try. Having used the 1 oz. bottle over the last couple of months, I and VERY pleased. BEST ORGANIC Vitamin C Serum for Face is a great product!  I find that it gently prevents ache and evens skin tone. Makes sense that if you can prevent ache blemishes while at the same time evening skin tone, your complexion will eventually improve. For me, this product did both. NOTE:  I keep my bottle in the refrigerator which makes for a nice cooling balm after shaving. It also preserves it, though I doubt if you use the 1 oz. bottle everyday that it would go bad. In summary, this is one of the best buys I&#x27;ve made on Amazon.</li>
    <li> i have used vitamin c serum  products before.  this product goes on smoothly, and it lasts a long time.  best if used with a moisturizer.  i noticed a difference within 1 week.  i have read about these serum products before, and they are supposed to absorb quickly and protect the skin by building collagen.  naturalico vitamin c serum with hyaronic acid is a very good product.  i have repurchased this item.</li>
    <li> I love that this is all natural.  It goes on easily and soaks in within a minute.  So far so good!</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product for two weeks, and normally wait to review any skin products for a few months, but I immediately saw results with this product. I have sunspots under my eyes, general redness, and large pores on my cheeks. In just two weeks, my skin texture feels incredibly smooth and soft, my skin looks more even and bright, the redness in my cheeks and nose have calmed down (didn’t expect this to happen – BONUS!), the sunspots have been visibly dulled, and my pores look tiny!</li>
    <li> Goes on clean with no sticky or oily residue.  Very strong formula so careful with drying and peeling skin began using every other day followed by hydrating moisturizer.</li>
    <li> What I love about Vitamin C serum is that it offers some amount of sun protection.I love this one because it does have a velvety feel. It does not feel oily or leave your skin oily. It does get absorbed pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this very long but I love the feel of it on my skin and my skin is looking brighter.</li>
    <li> A truly fantastic product.  Like silk.</li>
    <li> I did not receive this for free.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference right away!  My dark spots have lightened a bit and I get a great fresh glow too!</li>
    <li> It didnt work for me but this company has amazing customer service.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I am not good at skin regimens, but this product is so easy and quick to use that I have no problem applying to my skin at night before bedtime and in the morning before I apply my makeup. I have only been using this serum for a few weeks, but my skin does seem more nourished. The flakiness is gone and my makeup goes on much more evenly. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great serum. My face looks so much better since incorporating this product into my cleansing routine. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This serum makes my face feel tight and soft! I love this product and the fact that its organic makes it even more great.</li>
    <li> My wife and our adult daughter have tried several different brands of vitamin C serum, and they are both impressed with the sample of Bella Naturals/Naturalico Vitamin C Serum that I received for review purposes, and like that it&#x27;s full of organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not easy to find independent sources of information about vitamin C serum on the web. By independent I mean sources that have no vested interest in the marketing and sales of vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;London-based cosmetic dermatologist Sam (Samantha) Bunting says that to benefit skin, taking vitamin C internally (e.g., pills) isn&#x27;t enough, and that it must also be applied topically. She says that a vitamin C cream should contain at least 10% vitamin C and I&#x27;m guessing she would say the same about serum. According to Bella Naturals/Naturalico Vitamin C Serum&#x27;s labeling, this product contains 20% vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There can be quite a range in prices for vitamin C serums. We can compare the price for 1 ounce of this vitamin C serum with the same size but different brand sold at Nordstrom for over three times what you&#x27;ll pay for this one.</li>
    <li> I love this serum!! I bought it based on reviews and was very pleased with the results. It made my skin look and feel better.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and I love it! I notice a difference already and I am not breaking out from it as I have in the past with other serums! It&#x27;s so light, you don&#x27;t feel like you have anything on.</li>
    <li> I like the product. Works very well!</li>
    <li> Wooo this product  it is  FANTASTIC !  really .mi face is now clear and more young ! i love you..😘💘</li>
    <li> I Would Recommend This to a Friend Review by G. Corcoran, July 31, 2015 I might begin this review by saying that my best defense for aging skin has been sun safety, daily moisturizing, and avoidance of smoking.  As a woman who has just turned fifty, I have been told that my skin does not give my age away. With that said, I have recently noticed a change in my skin.  I might describe it as seeming less dewy, less bright, and harder to keep well-moisturized.  I recently saw a relative whose skin looked noticeably brighter and therefore more youthful.  This person told me about her recent use of Vitamin C/Vitamin E serum with the addition of Hyaluronic Acid.  She did not mention a particular brand and so I set out to give any one of them a try. Initially trying a different brand of this mixture, I found it hard to use as it just ran through my fingertips and much of it was wasted, therefore making whatever benefits it might have provided undetectable. Still determined, I then purchased Naturlico’s Vitamin C Serum.  Right from the start, I liked the application method of the dropper.  And the consistency seemed to hold together better so that it did not seem wasteful at all. I have used Naturlico two times a day after washing my face with a gentle cleansing lotion for nearly three months now.  I use slightly less than one dropper-full for my entire face and throat.  When it dries, my skin feels very, very smooth to the touch and the appearance is more translucent and reflective of light.  However, I have found that this serum alone is not enough for a daily skin regime as the skin’s surface is left feeling almost “tight” from the drying of this topical solution.  Following up with my daily moisturize is the finishing touch which makes this product worth it.  When Naturlico is allowed to dry and then moisturizer is applied the skin feels amazing; even more so than if moisturizer was just applied to newly cleansed skin. In the months that I have used Naturlico, Ihave been told that my skin looks brighter and more reflective of light cast upon it.  In addition, as a woman who has always had slightly enlarged pores on my T-zone, I am happy to report that they are seemingly less noticeable. And while I can’t say that that this is a miracle wrinkle solution, the condition of my skin of recent months makes my makeup look better, too.  And even when I am make-up free, much younger woman have complimented me on my youthful glow.  The other result that I am pleased to report, is that when I exfoliate, I seem to achieve better result with a brighter more beautiful me showing through. The bottom line is that I like this product as a new addition to a smart skincare regime.  It is affordable, and the bottle lasts me about 5 weeks so it is within easy budget.  I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> So far this vitamin C made me face look a little bit brighter but not a lot. It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky feeling or tingling. It hasn&#x27;t really done much to reduce the scars on my face, but I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and already see the remarkable difference. My skin always gets worse during the summer heat, but this year I was able to avoid irritations and breakouts. What I love is that this Serum is not oily at all, and it gives me that &amp;#34;clean face feeling&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to have finally have this in hand. The only dissapointment is that once I opened the package, the product was without the box. Is that something I should worry about? The product is sealed, should I still use this. I&#x27;ve never had this experience before, therefore I don&#x27;t know if this is the real deal! Did anyone else had this experience before?</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I&#x27;ve used serums costing twice as much, and this does everything the more expensive ones do with a few bonuses - it absorbs in seconds, so I&#x27;m not standing around waiting to apply my moisturizer, and it does not contain any retinol, so you don&#x27;t need to worry about wearing it in the sun.  It feels great on with no greasiness.  This is my new go-to serum!</li>
    <li> Immediately makes slim tighter and my skim tone had improved greatly!! I have gone from looking discolored and almost palish Greg to my full healthy olive tone again!! Amazing.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t see amazing results, bit the serum does keep your skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> Not too fond of this product.</li>
    <li> Works wonders use it 2 times daily</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always mainly used vitamin e oil, but figured I&#x27;d give this a try. I love how ultra light weight it is, and how much more even my skin tone is. Will definitely continue using alongside my other oils.</li>
    <li> I bought this serum for its recommended reviews for lightening and correcting capabilities. I haven&#x27;t used it for long (about a week), but I can tell a positive difference in the texture of my skin. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing more good results after 6-8 weeks.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service. Thanks</li>
    <li> This serum has no tacky or sticky texture. It has a thin consistency, which allows for quick absorption into the skin. It has no scent, great for those who are sensitive. The ingredient list is amazing, contains many natural ingredients, including hyaluronic acid which is amazing to hydrate the skin. This serum works like a charm, it really hydrates your skin. It has amazing anti aging properties, and its never too ealt to start using them. If tou want ro preserve your healthy youthful skin you need to start while you skin is great to prolong aging.  It really plumps your skin making it look glowy and healthy. I love serums, i think they are onw of the mmost important steps in your beauty regiment, and this one is really good. Definitely recommend it. Rhiswis my honest opinion for trying out this product</li>
    <li> Can see reduction of lines around my eyes and around my mouth!  Great product for an excellent price!</li>
    <li> Received quickly. Well packaged. Great product not to oily for the face. Received a discount for my review</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month and i can see it working.  I did not have any reactions using this product either. My skin tone was very uneven after years of being a sun goddess.  I can see my dark spots fading and more even skin tone.  I use it every day and use SPF 50 over my face now everyday.  I live in Arizona and avoiding the sun is impossible. But this product has helped so much.</li>
    <li> This is working well as a part of a larger healthy hair/skin/nails regimen. I say that because I don&#x27;t know how well it would work on it&#x27;s own, but if you&#x27;re drinking a lot of water, eating a lot of vitamin-rich plant foods, and taking other skin care measures, I think the effects of this serum are amplified. About a month ago I noticed dark circles under my eyes and I went into skincare hyperdrive, and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge improvement in my skin over the past month (including the disappearance of those dark circles).  I&#x27;m also taking the VitC/Hyaluronic acid Beauty Bursts and Biotin Bursts from NeoCell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this bottle has enough application for two months, the way I use it. I wash my face with jojoba oil and cold water, tone with witch hazel, and then I use a mixture of this and geranium essential oil to moisturize (so the rest of my skin care is relatively inexpensive). Well worth it!</li>
    <li> I have just finished my first bottle and will say I was impressed. Neglecting my dry skin over the years has left its mark, especially around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;This product has made some real headway in restoring what I thought was a lost cause!</li>
    <li> so far I really like it!</li>
    <li> Great smell, texture, and price!</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a very good product and I would recommend it. I have been using it for 6 months and find my skin is really clearer and radiant. i also find it works far better than those very expensive products.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and I love it! it leaves your skin baby soft and gives it an overall healthier look.</li>
    <li> I love this I use it almost everyday almost out. Need to get more like a habit!!  My skin is very important to me I use it along with my face cream moisturize #AWESOME</li>
    <li> Great stuff and the price is very reasonable. I can definitely notice a difference with my skin, it&#x27;s a lot smoother.  HeatherK</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum for a couple of months and am now certain that the dark spots (age spots) on my face have faded considerably. They used to be apparent even when I was wearing foundation; now the spots are invisible under the foundation. I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction in lines and wrinkles, but I didn&#x27;t really expect to. My main goal in using this product was to fade the age spots,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is contained in a small dark brown glass vial (to protect it from light which will degrade the product). I use the eye dropper to place a few drops onto my fingertips, then spread the watery serum over my face and neck. By the time I&#x27;m done putting on my body lotion, the serum has dried and then I apply my usual moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample for my use and review, and have found it more effective than other Vitamin C serums I have tried, so will definitely continue using this brand.</li>
    <li> I like it, but am not sure about the results.  It is difficult to tell how well it is working.</li>
    <li> I love how it makes my skin look and feel. Much brighter, firmer and smoother. I just placed another order 😉</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Skin feels great  I will definitely order it again.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my face (I have Rosacea) that&#x27;s definitely a good start. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see any anti-aging results. I like that it is organic and has Hyaluronic acid. After applying it feels a bit sticky, but then I apply a moisturizer and it becomes a mute point. It seems to be a very good antioxidant. Good value.</li>
    <li> I recently added this serum to my skin care routine. I love how smooth and soft my skin feels in the morning.</li>
    <li> Ok. I have tried every vitamin C product under the sun... Really. I&#x27;m likin this. The price was reasonable, and I noticed a difference after two days. It blends well with my facial oils and it tightens...Unlike some other C products this one seems to absorb rapidly and tighten up the skin.</li>
    <li> I randomly decided a couple of weeks ago to cut all of the crap out of my skincare regimen and stop wearing my chemical-full foundation. Purchasing this serum was part of that overall process (I actually bought it to put on after I dermaroll). This stuff is awesome! I haven&#x27;t tried any other vitamin C serums so I can&#x27;t compare it to the effectiveness of any other brand, but I love it so far. Every morning and night I wash my face as usual, splash it with witch hazel / aloe, and then put a full dropper&#x27;s worth of this on my entire face and neck before letting it dry and soak in for one to two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effect is that my skin feels firm and taught, but not at all tight or sticky. It&#x27;s similar to the way your skin feels after putting on a primer - just smooth and moisturized but matte. My skin (oily and acne prone) has cleared up dramatically since I started using this, but I also stopped using my liquid BB cream at the same time so it could be a combination of those two things. I ordered a vial of this for my mom as well (she&#x27;s in her early 50&#x27;s), and she is already stressing about running out because she loves it so much - her concerns are more with combating wrinkles and other signs of aging, rather than skin clarity.</li>
    <li> So far, so good! Definitely worth your money! Will buy more again!</li>
    <li> This serum has helped me even my skin tone, clear up redness, and restore some glow! I&#x27;ve also been making my husband use it for dark circles. I feel great about the ingredients, and I have seen results!</li>
    <li> I have been using the vit c serum about a week, I can tell an immediate difference in the texture of my skin. I think over time it is going&lt;br /&gt;to make a huge difference in the appearance of wrinkles and dehydrated skin.  I am excited about the long term results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Vitamin C serum for about four months now and am amazed at how effective it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is extraordinarily fair, heavily freckled, and (unfortunately!) fairly &amp;#34;lined&amp;#34; for my age (despite wearing sunscreen daily, wearing a hat when in the sun, and avoiding the sun as much as possible).  I have, since the age of 25-30, had deep lines between my eyes, across my brow, and around my lips (due to using straws, I believe).  Around age 35, I began getting lines near my eyes and very deep laugh lines, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to make myself accept my lines, I called them my &amp;#34;lines of wisdom,&amp;#34; but still (vainly, I suppose) wanted them to go away.  Hence the reason for buying this vitamin C serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~EFFECTS ON WRINKLES AND LINES~~&lt;br /&gt;Within about two weeks of daily use, I noticed the lines between my eyes were beginning to fade.&lt;br /&gt;Within about four weeks of daily use, I noticed the lines between my eyes were less than half as deep as they had been, the lines near my eyes were completely gone, and my laugh lines were beginning to fade.&lt;br /&gt;Within about eight weeks of daily use, I had a SIGNIFICANT reduction in the lines between my eyes, the lines near my eyes, and my laugh lines.  The lines around my mouth and my forehead lines haven&#x27;t been significantly affected, but I can deal with those if the others are so significantly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~USE ON SENSITIVE SKIN~~&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin that turns fire-engine-red when most skin products come in contact with it, but my skin handles this serum quite well.  I have ZERO redness, don&#x27;t break out, and have no other ill effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are expecting PERFECTION and to have the skin of a young child, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  This serum is excellent, but it isn&#x27;t able to erase the signs of aging completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are expecting to look just a few years younger, though, you&#x27;ll love this serum!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Very light and absorbs quickly! So far, I&#x27;m loving this product!</li>
    <li> Very nice serum. It doesn&#x27;t have much scent and very comfortable to apply. It goes on easily and absorbs pretty fast. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily. I layer it with lotion to lock in the moisture. Skin is very smooth after using it the next day. I have tried it for 2 weeks only and I like it so far.</li>
    <li> Seems to be helping my skin smooth out (prone to adult acne) and it&#x27;s easy under the daily moisterizer.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference</li>
    <li> I like how the serum makes my face feel. I have only been using it for about 2 weeks now so I can&#x27;t really say if it is working or not at this point but I will post in about a month and let everyone know what the final verdict is.  I also use Vitamin E oil 24,000IU  for the wrinkles around my eyes so I don&#x27;t know if that will also play a part in how my skin is doing. I highly recommend the Vitamin E oil used in conjunction with the Vitamin C serum and 100% pure tea tree oil (for people with acne prone skin such as myself) I have been told that my skin looks &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; since I have been using the combination.</li>
    <li> I use this product before my moisturizer, it seems to work nicely to keep my skin smooth.</li>
    <li> We were offered a sample of this serum and my wife tried it out. Here is what she has to say after about two weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This amounts to applying vitamins directly to your face instead of taking them orally. You would think that would be effective, and I found that it is. I got these noticeable benefits:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* More effective moisturizing when applied directly under my usual moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;* After a series of uses, my skin definitely felt a little tighter. I wouldn&#x27;t say a lot tighter, but it was noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;* This definitely gives my skin a pleasant glow.&lt;br /&gt;* It feels nice and is pleasant and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as wrinkle reduction, I expect the tightening feeling could lead to that, but I think I will have to use it for a longer time to see how much effect there is. Overall I like this product and I plan to continue to use it; it gives a lot of value compared to some very expensive creams that claim to do the same thing.</li>
    <li> I was sent Bella Naturals Victim C Serum for review and have been putting the product to the test. The product is 100% organic and has a pleasant odor. It comes in dropper form and I applied it to clean skin twice daily to my face and neck. It soothed my skin and gave it a firm feel. It dries quickly and I applied a daily moisturizer to my skin after. Within a few days I noticed my skin had a firm, healthy glow. The proof came when a few weeks later a friend asked me what I was doing differently ..that my face glowed. I wasn&#x27;t sure about the dropper and how much to apply, but followed instructions and used 6-12 drops with each application. I still have a good portion left and would anticipate a full bottle lasting 4-6 weeks.</li>
    <li> I received this serum free to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum has vitamin c and e both of which are supposed to be good for your skin. I am not sure what sea buckthorn oil is supposed to do but I have heard that rose hip oil is good for your skin. I’m really middle of the road with this serum; it’s not as thick as my favorites, but not thin and watery as some others. In the couple of weeks that I have used it I have seen no real change in my skin at all, and so I just can’t give this 5 stars because I don’t currently see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using it until it is gone and hope for some visible results. I still gave it three stars since I have sensitive skin and this product did not make me break out in extra acne or cause any allergic reactions or rashes. It absorbed quickly when applied to my skin and didn’t leave it feeling gross, oily or dirty. I also like the fact that it is mostly organic and natural, though 100% is always better!</li>
    <li> Naturalico Vitamin C Serum is an anti-aging serum that has powerful ingredients, they include Vitamin C, E and Hyaluronic Acid. This serum has 98% Natural and 72% Organic ingredients. Revives dull skin and reduces discoloration, I love that this serum has the ability to even out your skin tone. Vitamin C has the ability to decrease the prominence of hyperpigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;I loved trying out this serum by Naturalico because it’s hard for me to find a serum that doesn’t make my skin break out in hives or acne. This serum is so light-weight and made my skin feel so smooth. I noticed after about a week of using this in the mornings and at night, my skin tone was more even and my skin almost looked more firm. Honestly, I couldn’t believe how fast this product started working! I recommend this product to anyone who wants to start using an anti-aging product that actually works.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Light yet very moisturizing. I love to add a drop of jojoba oil to it. It only takes a very small amount, maybe half a dropper full. Its not necessary to use an excessive amount. I also sometimes mix it with my favorite moisturizer for night time use. This is a very versatile product. I definitely see .an improvement in the texture of my skin and ive only been using it for a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Just received my second bottle. I love this product!! I was hoping to help fade my over pigmentation due to excessive sun exposure and cannot afford laser treatments. I really didn&#x27;t expect much but it has really made a noticeable difference in evening out my skin tone. It&#x27;s affordable and cruely free!!</li>
    <li> I saw a dramatic difference in my skin within a week-will buy again!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I was at my wit&#x27;s end with my eczema on my neck and face. I purchased this product and started using it the night I received it. Within two days, my skin was transforming from dry and scaly to soft and smooth. It is wonderful and you must try it!</li>
    <li> so far, works pretty good. only a few weeks, with some improvement.</li>
    <li> Good product and price is right</li>
    <li> I still had some of my other brand left. I did open it to see how it felt. It is so much thicker than my other serum I&#x27;m using now. I liked how it felt but haven&#x27;t given it a true trial yet.</li>
    <li> What first drew me to this Vitamin C Serum is the fact that it is all organic and made with natural ingredients. And, it&#x27;s cruelty free! A big part of my New Year&#x27;s Resolution is to really make an effort to work more towards using all natural beauty ingredients. And, I am trying to go 100% cruelty free. The bottle is typical dark brown apothecary bottle that comes in a cute little gift box. Basically embodying the idea of a natural, simple beauty solutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with the Vitamin C, E and Hyaluronic Acid there is a ton of awesome ingredients including:  Aloe, With Hazel, Jojoba Oil, Japanese Green Tea, Sea Buckthorn Oil, Gotu Kola, Rosehip Oil, Dandelion, and Wild Geranium. Literally everything great for your skin rolled up into a nice little package!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is basically scentless. It is very VERY light. Although not completely translucent, the serum feels almost like water when you first apply it. And, I really like that. It doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m slathering on something that is going to suffocate my pores. I always worry when trying a new serum that it will be so heavy. I find that to be an issue for me when I use Argan or Rosehip base serums. Not here! I feel like I could slather this on without a care in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the serum is not very thick, it is easy to spread evenly. For about 2 seconds that I did have a moment of concern when first applying the serum. There are many products that claim to make you feel &amp;#34;dewy.&amp;#34; But, instead leaving you feeling sticky instead. This product actually delivered! About 20 seconds after application, the serum completely absorbed. No stickiness- just a fresh, soft face. I did feel a little tightening/plumping for about 30 minutes as well. But it was very subtle- I didn&#x27;t feel like my face was getting stretched out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum works extremely well as a base for my toning lotion and moisturizer. Which, to me means that it actually absorbs very well instead of just coating your face. It creates a nice glow and evens my skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel really great using Naturalico&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum. It is a natural, organic, cruelty free item that preforms as promised! I feel like this is such a great start to my New Year&#x27;s Resolution!</li>
    <li> Vitamin C Serum was sent to me for review and I was happy to get it.  I had been reading some of Linus Pauling&#x27;s books and I had a good idea concerning the power of Vitamin C to help us improve our health and well-being.  Pauling became famous by touting the value of Vitamin C to help us avoid getting the common cold.  All well and good, but what about Vitamin C to help us improve the health of the skin on our face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I learned was that \\&quot;Taking vitamin C through a supplement or food is beneficial to your health, but to specifically target signs of aging on your face, topical vitamin C is best. In fact, applying vitamin C to the skin can be 20 times more effective than taking it orally.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past two weeks I have been applying ten to twelve drops of the Vitamin C Serum to my face after showering in the evening and then in the morning after washing up.  I have noticed a significant improvement in the skin of my face since beginning this regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many topical ointments, creams, and lotions for my face, but the Vitamin C Serum is best thus far.  It has only a faint and pleasant smell, is absorbed immediately into the skin, and leaves my skin feeling fresh and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After conducting my own experiment, I then went to Amazon to read about the experience of others who are using the Vitamin C Serum.  What I discovered was that fifty-one people gave this product five stars.  The one person who gave it four stars did so because the Serum is expensive.  Fair enough, it is expensive.  I am going to make the count fifty-two five star reviews. If you can afford it, I think you are going to like this excellent oil for the face.  It works just as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a number of vitamin C serums for quite a while, and I recently had the opportunity to try Naturalico Vitamin C 20% with Hyaluronic Acid Serum by Bella Naturals. I love the fact that this serum is composed of 98% natural ingredients, 72% organic. And I love many of the herbal and plant extract in this formula, especially rosehip seed oil, seabuckthorn oil, plant stem cells etc. Impressive! Although good for all skin types, I think this lightweight formula is especially well-suited to those with combination or oily skin. It dries quickly and has no discernible scent. Plus, it&#x27;s really affordable. I recommend Naturalico Vitamin C 20% with HA to help boost collagen, repair fine lines, fade dark spots, and give an overall healthier appearance to your skin.</li>
    <li> I have not used other vitamin c serums to compare this to but I like the way it feels  and makes my skin looks</li>
    <li> The Vitamin C Serum contains 98% naturally derived ingredients and 72% organic ingredients. I would like to see the amount of organic ingredients be closer to 100%. Most of the ingredients have low to no toxicity based on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Database. The Vitamin C Serum contains one ingredient that does pose toxicity to the body: Phenoxyethanol (4). Since the Vitamin C Serum contains water, a preservative is needed for shelf life. Otherwise, you would need to use the product within 1-2 weeks and a lot of it would go to waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Vitamin C Serum for 2 weeks without any other anti-aging product applied to the face. My skin has wrinkles and dry spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Results: Skin feels hydrated, softer and more moisturized. Skin did not require use of moiturizer. Wrinkles have smoothed out a little. I love the smell of the serum, which does go away after a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I experienced good results after using Naturalico Vitamin C Serum for 2 weeks. I can use the Vitamin C Serum as a preventative measure to reduce future sun damage and wrinkles. If you are looking for a quick and easy way to naturally improve the look and feel of your mature and aging skin, Naturalico Glow Vitamin C Serum is a worthwhile investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received the product to facilitate the review. No other compensation was received. All opinions are my own and are honest.</li>
    <li> I feel like my skin feels smoother and brighter. I will reorder again</li>
    <li> Love it lots.  Works awesome.  Will continue to order the vitamin C.  Have my mom and daughter using it as well.</li>
    <li> Made no difference. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and seal was still intact. Absorbs very quickly. I apply at night, when I wake up my face is brighter and feels softer</li>
    <li> I was having a problem, but this product has helped.</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely wonderful product. I have been using it for 2 weeks now and I have noticed a marked improvement in my skin, others have too. I have struggled with skin issues my whole life and have some problems with skin discoloration and minor scarring to prove it. This serum is working wonders! I FINALLY found what my skin needed in this product. I can&#x27;t tell you how good it feels to be able to say &amp;#34;my skin looks good&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve never said that before. THANK YOU!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used it for three or four week but have not see any change in my skin.  I will continuing use it for another bottle and see what will happen.  I know it is not a magical so I try to be patient for a while.</li>
    <li> Great item. Face feels clean as soon as you put it on. Definitely buying again.</li>
    <li> I received it! I love the product and will definitely be purchasing other products in the brand!</li>
    <li> Not very thick. I&#x27;ve been using for a month. Don&#x27;t see a difference but it&#x27;s pleasant enough and hasn&#x27;&#x27;t made my skin break out.</li>
    <li> I was really amazed at how this stuff actually works!!  Never thought that I would find a product that isn&#x27;t deceiving...  Great stuff for fraction of the cost!</li>
    <li> Just purchased this vitamin C serum and just after 1 use my skin was softer. Cant wait to see how well it works long term. Another bonus was the email sent from company about how to use the product and other facts. So far a great buy.</li>
    <li> I like this product. When my first bottle ran out I reordered 3 more bottles so I can save 1 as a backup and give 1 to my sister. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and works great as a serum. It leaves my skin feeling little sticky after application (I&#x27;m guessing every vitamin c serum is like this?) but it goes away when I put another moisturizer on top.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I&#x27;ve seen a great improvement in my skin tone and fine lines around my eyes and mouth. My skin has a more youthful  glow thanks to this vitamin C serum.This product definitely met my expectations and  will continue to be a regular part of my skin care regime. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> I live near the beach and get way too much sun.  It can make my skin look ruddy and bland.  This serum gives me a glow that I lost years ago.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I have seen an improvement in my skin since using this product.  I definitely recommend it for anyone young or old.</li>
    <li> Good product. Only been using (inconsistently) for about a week and my face has improved a significant amount. I&#x27;m of mixed race with golden brown skin(darker) 25 yrs old and I deal with dark spots acne large pores uneven skin tone. Since using this my face looks completely clear from about a foot away! It&#x27;s glowing and super smooth. It also feels like it&#x27;s tightened my skin around my cheeks and jawbone! Can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a few months or so!!! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a month now. It does seem to tighten my pores and help stop breakouts, but I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in my skin tone. It has lightened acne marks, but it hasn&#x27;t lightened any of my age spots or freckles. I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my fine lines. The price is great,but don&#x27;t expect a miracle serum.</li>
    <li> It is great product for skin. I can say it good for acne, I have some acne and small red spot on my face and this product was helpful for faster healing ( I am surprising ) !</li>
    <li> I use Bella Natural&#x27;s Naturalico Vitamin C as a base for a twice daily treatment of a nice Retinol moisturizer. That sounds kinda strange coming from a guy, huh?  ;)  Actually, I am determined to rid my arms of way too many ugly age spots. The product goes on well, is not oily at all and is absorbed by the skin within a couple of minutes. I was surprised because I have very oily skin. It has a nice smooth finish to it and feels really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only a few days use of the vitamin c serum and Retinol treatments I am seeing remarkable results. The darkest spot on my left arm is almost pink in the center and radiating outward. The other spots are getting lighter, too, although not quite as noticeable as the one mentioned. I am very pleased with the results to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So guys .. simply because this product seems to be marketed for the ladies, don&#x27;t let that deter you from using it. I hope it works as well for you as it is for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne prone skin all my life and along with being outside a lot I have a lot of dark spots. I researched how Vit C serums can help, but because of my sensitive skin I&#x27;ve become a naturalist and look for organic and non-irritating ingredients. I&#x27;m also on a budget. This product is great because it&#x27;s natural, has great stuff for acne prone skin, and it&#x27;s affordable! My dark spots have faded considerably with consistent use and there is no irritation, in fact it makes your skin feel soft and moisturized, thank you for this product!!</li>
    <li> I use this with along with dermarolling and it is awesome. A little goes far, its not drying or oily, when I apply it, I can&#x27;t even tell its one. After this I usually apply vitamin E and sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Guys serum is more than good but i&#x27;ve been ordered 2 of ur serums and charged for 2 but received only one serum.... and i don&#x27;t see any 1 doing anything regarding my issue on that matter which is very disappointing ....</li>
    <li> Took about week to see a difference but my face is brighter and looks and feels healthy. Product is great! Will be reordering for myself and mother.</li>
    <li> Finally I have found a very reasonably priced product that I believe works!!!!  This will definitely be a stocking stuffer this year along with many reorders for myself.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Leaves the skin smooth and shining.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the serum long enough to see if it fades hyperpigmentation just yet, however, it doesn&#x27;t break me out or irritate my skin, it has no scent, and it is easy to use. So far it&#x27;s a wonderful product. I will keep an eye out for how it works over the next few months.</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive to many of the beauty products on the market today.  I was hesitant to try this Vitamin C serum but jumped in and gave it a try.  I was able to use it with no side effects!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains botanical 20% Vitamin C and E as well as vegan hyaluronic acid serum.  It also lists ingredients of organic rosehip oil, resistem (plant stem cells), green tea extract and sea buckthorn oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using, I applied moisturizer as stated in the directions.  It does fade age spots and helps reduce fine lines around the eyes and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to fine an anti-aging product that I could use.  I little goes a long ways so the price is reasonable as well.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my mom. It arrived promptly and on time. I asked her how it worked for her and she says it did a good job. Her skin show a fair change during her first bottle usage. She expected to see more of a change, but nothing good comes right away. We got a second bottle for free and that also arrived promptly. She just started using the second bottle, and has been prompting me to start using it as well. This is a good product for those that care about their skins health and beauty. The seller is quick in answering any questions that you have and are very respectful. I highly recommend purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> This serum works amazing well.  You can feel the tightness when it starts to dry.  I continue to buy this product</li>
    <li> I love  this product. I can see an improvement in the fine lines and sun spots on my face.  I use it at night before bed.  While some people have said it&#x27;s expensive it does last.  A little goes a long way.  My bottle lasted about a month and a half. I try to use it everyday but sometimes forget.  Lol.  That being said,  using it every other day still produced visible results!  I have been carded while out several times since using the vitamin C serum.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this Serum for three weeks and have definitely seen a tremendous improvement on my skin. I had a lot of dark spots which is gradually disappearing. I have been receiving many compliments from people on my skin who states that I am looking more youthful everyday.</li>
    <li> I have used this Vitamin C Serum for a month. It&#x27;s a good product. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the start but after a week my skin texture was much better. It&#x27;s the best Vitamin C serum I have used until now.</li>
    <li> I am loving the serum. My skin looks and feels smooth and clear. I noticed from the first time I used it how amazing my skin felt.</li>
    <li> This vitamin c serum is great I love it. I will buy this brand  every chance I get it&#x27;s getting rid of my fine lines around my mouth area I can barely see them and I haven&#x27;t been using it long</li>
    <li> Very good serum. My dark spots are less noticeable on mu face.  But expensive for the amount in the bottle</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Bella Naturals, Naturalico Vitamin C Serum for a week now, and I am super impressed. with it  Not just with the results I am seeing, but also with the product itself. The serum is easy to apply, and isn’t excessively sticky and gross. It soaks into my skin and dries quickly— allowing for less time to be spend waiting before applying moisturizer or makeup. Moisturizer and makeup both apply per usual, and I haven’t witnessed any clumping or running (as can be the norm with some other serums.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the few short weeks that I&#x27;ve been using this product, I have noticed my skin has a healthy glow,My skin is also soft, and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I rarely ever used sunscreen growing up either skiing or in the water.  Now in my fifties; I’ve had five pre-cancerous bumps frozen off my face.  My dermatologist gave me Retin-A (which burned) to initially help remove bad skin layers.  Then she prescribed a cream called Glycerol which helped a lot.  She also advised I get some Vitamin C (with Vitamin E) lotion for after, I thought that was too much stuff to deal with every day, especially since the Vitamin C material was so expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Naturalism offered to send me a sample bottle, I figured it was a good idea.  Within a week, I actually noticed what people are calling a ‘glow’ and the wrinkles under my eyes seem to go away.  This is not something I can do forever, but it has to be something I do for as long as I can.  This product is about one-third the price of dermatologist material.  I really can’t tell you if one or the other is better, but this one works great.  I just feel a little better and it’s nice not to shave and cut bumps.  This is a good product.</li>
    <li> This serum is easy to use, distributes evenly over the skin and absorbs quickly. My skin has never felt softer or more smooth. I  notice that the age lines on my neck area, especially, seem less pronounced. This is a great anti-aging product to use in conjunction with your facial/neck moisturizer to help roll back the years and give you baby-soft skin again.</li>
    <li> I am very fussy with what I apply on my face because I have sensitive skin. I am really surprised that this serum is not harsh on my skin. I like this Naturalico serum because it&#x27;s organic with  Hyaluronic Acid, Rose Hip and Sea buckthorn oil which help in moisturizing, protecting the skin from free radicals and the added Vit. C promotes production of collagen which makes the skin youthful and fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my mid-40s and it is high time to use serums like this one because of the signs of aging like age spots and fine lines and some wrinkles. I have some fine lines near my eyes and few age spots which have lightened after several days of using Naturalico. I can notice a nice glow in my complexion which my family and friends have noticed as well and considering that it is winter, it&#x27;s so hard to achieve a natural \\&quot;pinkish\\&quot; glow without the use of a blush on or cosmetic but I can see that my cheeks are rosier and I don&#x27;t even have to apply make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is more soft than usual too which I am very happy about. I also like that this serum does not contain parabens and alcohol which are both harmful to our skin. It does not have any scent and I prefer my serums to be unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this serum to people who are starting to battle the signs of aging. It is safe even to sensitive skin like mine.</li>
    <li> Works as good as other vitamin c serums I tried. I put a drop under each eye and let it dry. It makes your wrinkles look better.</li>
    <li> Excellent. We need this for our daily regimine for our skin! Great price.</li>
    <li> This serum is AMAZING!! My skin is more even colored and just radiant !!! I look so youthful I love it, and it&#x27;s super cheap you only need a little bit and it doesn&#x27;t leave your face oily. I think this bottle will last me over a month and I use it everyday. I started to notice results within 2 days!!!</li>
    <li> I Love it. I&#x27;m a pruned acne skin and with this serum has help me. I recommend to anyone, is great</li>
    <li> I really like the way this feels on my skin. Tingles a little, then the tingling fades away. I use it before I moisturize/apply Retin-A, and it&#x27;s worked very well. Sometimes new cosmetics will cause a weird reaction -- flaking or bumps -- but so far, I&#x27;ve experienced nothing but softer skin from using this. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note: Some of hyaluronic acid formulations are more gel-like. This one is pretty liquid-like. Whether that&#x27;s good or bad is up to your personal taste. I prefer a more gel-like formula because the liquid can run through my fingers before I get it on my face; on the other hand, liquid goes on very easily and dries quickly. So it can be an advantage as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a free sample for the purpose of giving my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> AFTER ONE APPLICATION, I WOKE WITH RASH ON FOREHEAD, SIDE OF NOSE AND UPPER LIP.</li>
    <li> When I found this company, I was first of all excited because the company is located in a city I lived by growing up. This is not the only reason I decided to use this anti-aging product though. But, I was more than happy to support a company that makes their anti-aging facial product in America and in a California city I grew up next to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this said, once I began dabbing this anti-aging serum on my forehead, cheeks, nose, chin and neck, I was very pleased at the results I began to see. This amazing Anti Aging serum is made with Vitamin C + E + Hyaluronic Acid and will Instantly make your face look brighter and more radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, you won&#x27;t find a better quality and more effective Vitamin C Serum on today&#x27;s market that contains pure, 98% natural/ 72% organic ingredients.  The use of Vitamin C is now known to brighten the skin and will also stimulate the production of collagen. The use of Hyaluronic Acid will bind moisture to the skin, while keeping it hydrated and reducing those fine lines and wrinkles as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those unkind age spots, with this anti aging serum, which is rigorously tested, will make a difference in the firmness and youthfulness of your skin. There is no time to waste when it comes to slowing down the aging process and showing off your younger looking self with the BEST ORGANIC Vitamin C Serum for your face.</li>
    <li> NATURALICO has a very fine product here  - a Vitamin C serum for the face that is enhanced by the addition of botanical 20% Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and Vegan Hyaluronic Acid as well as Rosehip oil, Resistem, Green Tea, and Sea Buckthorn. The resulting very soothing serum plumps the skin of the face, gradually reducing fine lines and wrinkles and stimulates collagen and elastin production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In keeping with the name of the product, everything is natural and organic and safe for all skin types. The initial changes you will note when just beginning to use this serum is the glowing moisture enhanced appearance that it offers the facial skin. Continued use produces reduction in age spots and fine lines and wrinkles. The container is a brown glass 1 oz bottle (to protect the serum from light damage) and the applicator is a simple eyedropper. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, this is a very satisfying product. Grady Harp, December 14</li>
    <li> Review not necessarily about product. When item arrived, seal was on on top cap, it did not seal lid to bottle.  Since this product is not ingested or put in the eyes I will use it. Better QA needed.</li>
    <li> Great for the price .just like the one I bought for twice the price in a Heath food store</li>
    <li> First time trying a vitamin C serum on my face and I was amazed. After the first use my skin was SO soft, baby smooth. All I did was put a little dab of the serum in my fingers to rub on my face and neck and I didn&#x27;t need much more than two drops, which means it should last me a long time. My skin looks brighter and feels way healthier. Plus it&#x27;s an anti aging so the long term results will be great. Will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Not at all disappointed! Great product! Works just as promised, gives bright completion and plumps wrinkles, absorbs fast and is very affordable, especially compared to similar products.this is now a staple in my beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> Been using the product over a week now. No side effects unlike other facial products I used. Not yet sure of long term positive result. Some peeling on my targeted areas which are to be expected of natural acids on skin.</li>
    <li> I did an extensive research on this product before purchasing it and I&#x27;ve found mostly great reviews on its effectiveness. I have to say that most of those comments are true. I do notice a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance just after one usage; I mean it in a good way too. My pores look smaller, and my skin seems firmer minutes after applying the serum. I can&#x27;t say how long the effects last though. It&#x27;s a pretty light serum, and it&#x27;s never caused any irritation to my skin either.</li>
    <li> Just applying this vitamin c serum has be falling head over heels for it. First the packaging is beautiful and brilliant in color. Accenting the top with a hint of silver. Even the branding is applied to the bottle which is easy to open and apply when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After opening and applying there is ever so slightly a scent but you have to really look or smell for it. When I was expecting this smell of citrus and orange if I was being frank about it. But there was nothing of the sort. Even the texture surprised me a bit, thinking that it would be super slimy it instead was almost like a watered down gel texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying this to my most dried areas made them so much softer and smoother. Even on my burnt areas of my hands it was almost soothing. So I could see it working on fine lines and wrinkles on the face. Plus, with the added oils and acids it promotes so much more to bring healthier and more beautiful skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I was sent a free sample of Vitamin C 20% Serum to test from Naturalico.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately I have been sampling a lot of Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid serums to fight the signs of aging.  Winter in the Midwest is especially harsh on my skin and I am up to try just about anything to help.  Naturalico&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum is a helpful resource as I felt it protected my skin; keeping it firm and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Vitamin C Serum is made with natural ingredients like pure sea buckthorn oil, organic hyaluronic acid and organic rosehip oil.  This is one of the only Vitamin C serums that claims to use 72% organic ingredients which I imagine is much better for you than synthetic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is odorless and colorless and is a thin consistency.  The instructions say to shake well to avoid the ingredients separating and to apply a moisturizer after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned I received this sample for free for my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum is almost clear and has a sweet smell with elements of citrus and spice. It is slightly viscous, which makes it easy to apply to the skin. The amber glass bottle protects it from the light and has a dropper cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few drops massaged into the skin after a bath or shower immediately causes a slight tingly sensation because it is so concentrated. Use a moisturizer a few minutes later to prevent drying the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is blend of helpful ingredients such as aloe, vitamin C, vitamin E, MSM, hyaluronic acid, sodium PCA, and jojoba oil, in an herbal infusion. The serum improves the appearance of the skin by increasing hydration, reducing the effect of fine wrinkles, and removing dead skin cells. It has an immediate soothing effect on dry, flakey skin. I have also found that regular application seems to minimize the appearance of facial pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many well-designed scientific studies that demonstrate that topical vitamin C significantly reverses the damage done to the skin by the sun when used for several months. Regular application over a period of many weeks or months is necessary to see the promised benefits--it is not an instant cure for damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bella Naturals provided vitamin C serum for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> I received this to review and I LOVE IT! I did not see this in the description that it helps with this, but since using it my pores look smaller, maybe it is me, but I can tell a big difference.</li>
    <li> This serum leaves my skin feeling super smooth and soft the next morning after I use it. There is a little bit of a tightening feeling when applied, but not too much. No noticeable smell. Haven&#x27;t noticed any wrinkle/ fine line reduction, but not many new ones either! Good value &amp; would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing vitamin c serum. I have tried many and this is by far the best quality and quantity. Be patient it takes time to see true results.</li>
    <li> So far this stuff seems to be helping. I just started using it, so it may take some time to give a complete review. I have fine lines and some post acne spots I am trying to rid of. My only negative comment is the smell is not great. It&#x27;s kinda an after effect. The but is you have to take the good with the bad and honestly I prefer if not smelling so great, rather than having perfume fragrance added 😀  This is an update! All I have to say is WOW this stuff is amazing. My review was premature so I had to give it time and boy what a difference it has made. I will purchase again. I love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Feels nice on the skin . I like the texture. Just started to use it.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C serum was recommended by my esthetician.  Of course, the line she carried was $100.  How happy was I when I found this for a reasonable price.  Will make this a part of my daily routine and always buy from Bella Naturals.  My face does feel refreshed after each use and Vitamin C is so good for us anyway.</li>
    <li> Great product for my skin.</li>
    <li> I got this product for testing purposes, why you should buy Naturalico Vitamin C and not other brands?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried it and I can tell you this things.&lt;br /&gt;- Totally natural ingredients and cruelty free!!! One of the ingredients I love are roseship oil &amp; green tea extract.&lt;br /&gt;- No alcohol or parabens.&lt;br /&gt;- Can be used on any type of skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Helps reducing fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;- Stimulates production of collagen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for 2 weeks and I’m starting to see the difference, it really gives an extra glow to the skin. My skin is super oily and I was afraid this would make it worse, but no, this hydrated my skin without making it oilier, it feels really soft and reduced the size of my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day on clean skin after applying the toner and I will keep on using it. This product is amazing and I really recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have nothing to lose, they even offer a refund if you don’t feel satisfied. But I can assure you will :)</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed using this serum - it comes in a nice 1oz amber glass bottle (darker bottles help protect the oils &amp; other ingredients from light damage which can break down the product and cause it to lose its effectiveness -- it essentially extends the shelf life) with a dropper applicator.  The serum itself is pretty clear and not overly thick. It has a pleasant light and natural scent. I use this morning &amp; night, after washing my face, using my toner, and using my Derma Roller.  I apply the serum, which is quickly absorbed and doesn&#x27;t leave any tackiness behind.  Then I apply my moisturizer.  I also dab it on throughout the day as necessary (and I like to &#x27;set it&#x27; with a mist of my spray toner). It&#x27;s a great way to perk up your skin all day long and gives a nice little face lift with its instant firming.  Make sure you shake it a bit too since the ingredients can separate a bit. I was happy to be able to try this serum in order to provide a review and am happy to recommend it.  For this price and the amount of quality ingredients, this would make a great addition to anyone&#x27;s skin care program!</li>
    <li> I am Brazilian and I met this product by friends who already used it.  The product is amazing!  I use every day in the morning and night after wash face.  Soft, firm and nourished skin. I recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Love it Love it Love it</li>
    <li> I am 58 yrs old.  Oily face. I love C serums. Better than any retinol WITHOUT the flakes and side effects - no matter the price&amp;gt; I have bought them all.  This C cheaper and doesnt turn crusty dry on skin (ISN&#x27;T AS DRYING) as two others I bought on Amazon.  Most women will have to use a moisturer after this dries. I do not. I get oily in an hour so in summer use nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed I cant find EWG info on them - but for now I love the way my face and hands look much smoother and hands LESS crapey. Hand lotions only plump and hide - this tightens hand tops. No crows feet but never had those. This will/does tighten that thin skin if you have them...</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin ! Not oily or to dry and results r ok not a big differents</li>
    <li> I love this product. After 3 weeks of using this my skin is tighter and firmer.</li>
    <li> My wife has been looking for a good, non-greasy vitamin C/E serum for a while and I think this may be the one! Naturalico&#x27;s Hylauronic Acid Serum provides an instant face-refresher with a tingly sensation and it is almost immediately absorbed by the skin. Her skin actually takes on a temporary pinkish glow after a few drops of this amazing stuff! It&#x27;s as if the facial capillaries have been stimulated and brought back to life. I like using it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no irritation or any greasy residue. It goes on easily and provides an instant hydrating effect that feels good while allowing the skin to breathe. After a few weeks use, my wife&#x27;s complexion looks more vibrant and she claims it feels terrific. She really loves how luxurious it feels on the face and how easy it is to use. The dropper is a bonus as makes for more convenient application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
    <li> I have dry skin+rosacea so my skin is very picky! I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and am very pleased! I have used others in the past but this is NOT sticky on my face and makes my skin feel smooth. I allow ample time after application of this before I put on my moisturizer. I am a big fan! :)</li>
    <li> I thought it was gonna be a good product for me since the reviewes were most of them good. Well maybe I wasnt following the washing your face before going to bed and apply it, I.might skip a few nights but I already have less than half bottle and I cannot say I seem much improvements.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C serum twice daily for a couple of weeks now and love it.  It works well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my &amp;#34;difficult&amp;#34; skin.  I prefer to use natural and organic ingredients whenever possible, and the price and effectiveness of this product make it a great deal.</li>
    <li> Worked wonders on my skin especially around the nose area and eye corners. I am truly amazed by this product.&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C is crucial for the skin, air and nails. I am a sucker for Vitamin C. This serum works wonders on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;My acne scars have lightened and my skin feels softer.&lt;br /&gt;The big plus is that I don&#x27;t have to apply different products to softening my skin, making it glowy,lightening my scars and so on. It is all in one.&lt;br /&gt;Drink plenty of water, eat greens and apply this serum in conjunction, and you will have te Hollywood skin.&lt;br /&gt;It has only been a few weeks and my friends keep asking me what have I been doing.&lt;br /&gt;Since you apply it directly to our skin, it comes in direct contact and works faster and more efficiently as compared or eating supplements.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t even smell bad. In fact, I like it&#x27;s light pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin. This serum is made of 100% organic ingredient. So far, I haven&#x27;t had any reactions to it. No bumps, acne or rashes.&lt;br /&gt;Its consistency and feel on the skin is similar to a moisturizer. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel oily and greasy. The serum absorbs into the skin immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Once I run out of this, I will definitely be buying this again. I have already told my mother about it and she has ordered one for herself as well.&lt;br /&gt;Application: I wash my face at night, dry it and apply a few drops of  the serum onto my skin. And in two weeks only, I have felt a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a copy of this product to evaluate and I am so glad that I did.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff just be careful what you use as a moisturizer!  My old routine was to use the Philosophy Purity and the second exfoliating step, followed by Bio Oil as I&#x27;m trying to get rid of acne scars. I never reacted poorly to Bio Oil or any other product on my skin. I have dry skin (I&#x27;m Afro-Caribbean) that&#x27;s prone to hyperpigmentation but it is not sensitive  by any means. I added this to my routine and the ENTIRE left side of my face broke out. I left my skin alone for about a week and I figured it was the combination of products that didn&#x27;t agree with my skin.  My second try I eliminated the Bio Oil and used my Pond&#x27;s Dry Skin cream and it made a huge difference with the breakout! I plan on trying it with a tone corrector moisturizer and a new toner and seeing what happens although I&#x27;m definitely nervous since it seems like the combination of products has an effect.</li>
    <li> I love that my skin looks more radiant, my skin tone is more even and my skin&#x27;s texture is better than ever before!</li>
    <li> Great product. Bought for my wife. Would see the skin a little firmer and face glows and fresh after couple uses. She would recommend it. Easy to use. She hopes they would have something targeting eye wrinkles and bags.</li>
    <li> Small noticeable difference around my eyes and laugh lines.  I put it on then I put on my makeup. I also use it with moisturizer at nite. I live in the desert so it&#x27;s very dry here. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle drug. I am not sure if I would repurchase .</li>
    <li> After 3 weeks of used I can see and feel my face improving.... I love it! And will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I have been using Vitamin C serum for quite some time now, and have tried different brands. I have to say this one is great. It works wonders. I am 45 years old and get complements all the time, people say that I do not have wrinkles, and that is true. I apply the serum every morning after i wash and tone my face. It goes on smooth and does not have any strong smell which I like. It gets absorbed very quickly by my skin so I am able to put moisturizer in no time. The company stays by its product which is rare noways.  I recommended this Vitamin C Serum to everybody who wants to look younger and fresher.</li>
    <li> I really like this serum - I use it after my cleanser and before my moisturizer.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for only 3 days, and already i&#x27;m amazed.  my skin doesn&#x27;t absorb things like moisturizers, for whatever reason.  but i had my fingers crossed that it would let these drops sink in.  and IT DID! not only that, but after applying this serum to my face, my moisturizer immediately soaked into my skin.  i&#x27;d give this product 5 stars for that alone!&lt;br /&gt;however, in just 3 days, my skin has gotten so soft.  it&#x27;s to soon to tell if it will help with light wrinkles or dark spots, but the softness of my skin is another stand alone reason i&#x27;d give this produce 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll update this in a few weeks, when it&#x27;s had more of a chance to help my skin.  just wanted to post this as i was absolutely stunned!</li>
    <li> I have never tried a Vitamin C or E serum before and within days of using it more an more friends noticed a difference in my skin and compliments ensued. After many years of acne issues that caused damage, I can use all the help I can get! The only downside is that I wish the bottle was bigger.</li>
    <li> I use the vitamin C on my face before I put on my moisturizer I gave it a 4 star because it leaves my face a bit dry. otherwise it really keeps the breakouts and blackheads away.  great product  will use again I will just have to and something with the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> You can see by the reviews this product is extraordinary, but I will add my name to the list of very satisfied customers.  I am two weeks from gaining the very distinctive age of 70 but many have a difficult time believing that.  The Naturalico Vitamin C Serum has kept my face almost without a wrinkle which is quite amazing.  I live in Arizona and with the hot/dry climate most people who are my age begin to look like a sun-dried prune.  I am thankful that I found this product to avoid premature aging of the skin.  Thanks Naturalico!</li>
    <li> Great serum firm your face in minutes I&#x27;m highly recommend this item for evryone</li>
    <li> This is great stuff, I can see my old acne scars much less after using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m shocked. I&#x27;ve been using this for less than a week now -- a liberal application morning and night after cleansing and toning. I already see a visible difference. The skin under and around my eyes looks much plumper and more hydrated. Many of the fine lines are gone. I can&#x27;t say that about many of the much more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I am a skeptic about ordering things of this nature online but I found this product to be truly amazing.  I discovered after using the first bottle that the fine lines around my eyes and upper lip especially were dramatically diminished.  I am on the second bottle now and expect the results to continue.</li>
    <li> THIS IS SUCH A GOOD PRICE FOR WHAT YOU GET  IT HAS HELPED MY COMPLEXION AND SAGGING  I WILL SURELY KEEP USING IT  I USE IT TWICE A DAY IT ACTUALLY MAKES MY SKIN FEEL FIRMER AFTER APPLYING IT TOO</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price! It really seems to brighten my complexion.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my purchase of Bella Naturals serum.  First, I like that it is organic and therefore natural ingredients are used; and, second that it is clear, light, and fragrance free!  Definitely will buy again.  At bedtime, I use it on the back of my hands in the hope that it will help with the dark spots.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for 6 weeks and have not seen any difference.</li>
    <li> I would buy this product again. It is as described.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Absorbs quickly and my skin looks great. It has smoothed my crowsfeet.</li>
    <li> I love this so much, I suffer from Eczema and right now in the dead of winter in Michigan it is at its high point.  My skin was flaking and dry and the texture was just awful. I apply the tiniest amount to cover my entire face sometimes applying a bit more on my very needy patches of skin. Then just wow my skin is sooo soft, and I started seeing the effects for that purpose right way! I can only imagine what else is to come as I continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use products though I like them to smell pleasant. I&#x27;m thinking that, because this product has no perfume additives is why I am smelling what I can only describe as a sort of yeasty or bread kind of smell, smelling it straight from the bottle. I didn&#x27;t find that as annoying as I thought I would, because once you apply it to your face and it absorbs fully, there is no scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other things I like are the label, not every company does this but I love when there is a safe to use date on the label, this product has that label with a 12 month time frame. Considering how little you need to use of this product for it to work, I&#x27;m betting I will be able to use for that long as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you guys/gals find this review helpful, I know most will be looking for review on the anti aging aspects, but it does benefit people with eczema too, to help with the overall texture of your skin :)</li>
    <li> My wife use hyaluronic and vitamin C serum regularly.  It is part of her ritual along with a derma roller.  The Naturalico brand is easier to apply because it is thinner in consistency.  It is almost scentless when applied into the skin which is a plus.  It is non-greasy and it gets absorb quickly into the skin.  The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is that you tend to use more because it is much thinner and flows faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: Sample bottle was provided for this review.</li>
    <li> After using a Vitamin C serum in conjunction with my Derma Roller micro-needling scar treatments for the better part of last year I was hooked and wanted to order another bottle as back up ASAP. Naturalico reached out to me about reviewing their new 20% Vitamin C serum and sent a free review sample. I noticed the ingredients were very similar to the serum I had been previously using and expected the consistency and feel of Naturalico&#x27;s to be the same. Much to my surprise they were not.    Naturalico&#x27;s Vitamin C serum is a thick clear jell consistency which feels very soothing when applied to the skin and almost immediately liquefies and absorbs in with gentle tapping. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any fragrance to this product which I&#x27;m thankful for nor any dimethicone which I&#x27;m allergic to. The next day I could see an immediate difference in my skin, especially with the left over dark spots from a recent allergic reaction. The vitamin C seemed to attack them the most, causing the dark patches of skin to peel off revealing pink new skin underneath. My entire face looked brighter and clearer too.    Something about this particular formulation is really, really good (the vitamin C is the 3rd ingredient) and I like that the serum itself is clear. I have since learned that high heat and sunlight can degrade the vitamin C, yellowing it and causing it to become inactive. Now I wounder if that was the problem with my previous serum because it definitely did not perform the way this one does. Out off all the C serums I have tried this remains my favorite.</li>
    <li> I love it when I come across another Vitamin C Serum that rocks and get to share with my readers!  I have been using this one that Naturalico sent me to review for them for my blog, GlamRiver for the last couple of weeks and it&#x27;s definitely one to add to  your skincare routine!&lt;br /&gt;This Organic Vitamin C Serum by Naturalico is lightweight and absorbs really quickly.  I like to apply the serum on my face, around my eyes, decollete and even my shoulders.  It has helped diminish the look of my Melasma aka hyperpigmentation and now my skin tone looks more even.  Yay!  It also contains Hyaluronic Acid and Organic Sea Buckthorn Oil and those ingredients have really helped plump up my skin, especially around my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;I tried A LOT of Vitamin C Serums at A LOT of different price points and I think this is a really great serum at a really great price!</li>
    <li> Great Product! makes my skin feel wonderful.  my pores appear to be getting smaller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 59 years old and have been reading about the break thru discovery of vita c on the skin. I decided to try it for myself. I have been using Naturals for about a month now. It&#x27;s has faded my age spots and improved the overall appearance of my skin. It looks brighter and much more even toned. I&#x27;ve been using it on my neck also and have noticed the deep lines seem less noticeable. I will continue to use this product to see the long term affects, but so far I&#x27;m really happy. Ive used very expensive dept store wrinkle creams in the past that do nothing. This is well worth the $20 dollar investment. I do recommend you give it a try.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I am a fan of organic ingredients in a product, and after using this organic serum for a couple of weeks, I can definitely see visible&lt;br /&gt;improvement in the texture of my skin.  Thank you Bella Naturals for an effective product without the high dollar price tag that&lt;br /&gt;spa treatments or prescribed products cost today.</li>
    <li> Helps with scarring and overall feel of my face. My boyfriend didn&#x27;t wear sunscreen for years and has deep wrinkles that seem smoother.</li>
    <li> Overall,  my skin tone is evened out and feels softer. I haven&#x27;t noticed my sun spots got lightened as much as other viewers,  but this is definitely a far better than higher name brand vitamin C serums that I have used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been testing out a few different serums and this one is definitely one of the worst ones. My face seems to be more dull after I use it. I just noticed another reviewer said that most of the reviews are fake, and I have to say I agree. There was a 3 star review posted and then right after, today there have already been 5 reviews posted by people who have only ever reviewed this product, all 5 stars and very short. Amazon should really investigate these reviews for authenticity.</li>
