      <li>love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I am so in love with this that I gave a jar to my mother, who is having a problem with wrinkles and she loves it as well.</li>

      <li>Easy purchase.</li>

      <li>This cream is inexpensive but very good, delivers moisture well, specially working well for dry skin.</li>
      <li>But I have noticed a huge difference in my skin.</li>
      <li>I also walk around naked for about 20 minutes to let it fully absorb lol.</li>
      <li>knew it was for me when a 20something PA could not stop commenting on what &#x27;fantastic skin&#x27; I</li>
      <li>and she wants her own.</li>
      <li>It is not too oily, does not cause blemishes and goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>It has a light pleasing fragrance.</li>

      <li>I use Nivea Body Creme and find it gives me smooth skin during winters.</li>
      <li>I use it primarily on my hands and feet, but also on my face during the winter months.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a smooth tone to my face after using it.</li>
      <li>I put it on right out of the shower and it works magic.</li>
      <li>It has a LOVELY smell that is fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>and I still have a pretty good tan thanks to Nivea Creme.  </li>
      <li>I do want to mention two other benefits, this product is non-greasy and has a very light pleasant aroma.</li>
      <li>and I hope it helps many of you out as much as it has with my momma and I!</li>
      <li>I originally bought a sample of this in a dollar store and used it on a scaly patch on my face that kept recurring.  </li>
      <li>Nivea is very good quality and adds some perfume and wax to the typical mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it for dry and combination skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this product all my life it works</li>
    <li> Nivea Creme, in my personal opinion, is the best body lotion out there. For fear of acne, I admit I haven&#x27;t used it on my face. But for hands and body care, this stuff is amazing. Over winter break, I developed a few dry patches on my neck and hands. I used a number of different brands of lotion, all of which seemed to fix the patches temporarily. After a shower, or after washing my hands, the patches would show up again. I ended up trying Nivea Creme after buying a jar at Target, and it eradicated the dry spots in a matter of two days. The stuff is thick, but it works great. The scent is also really pleasant.</li>
    <li> Nivea are leaders in this field and have a tried and trusted product. Excellent quality and the cost was not bad either.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Always have and always will.</li>
    <li> Its okay really wasnt for me felt super thick</li>
    <li> As a hand creme:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first bought this in desperation in the dollar section. This past winter really took a toll on my hands and they were so dry they were bleeding. I had tried numerous other moisturizers, some cheap, some EXTREMELY expensive and none really worked well. My hands had horrible scaly parts that would not go away. My hands looked like the hands of a dead person and felt like tree bark, even when I moisturized every time I washed my hands. It was awful. I grabbed this stuff on a whim because I loved the look of the pretty blue tin (the small sizes come in little metal containers). I slathered it on, paying special attention to the scaly bits and let it soak in. Within minutes, my hands underwent a total transformation. They were soft, touchable, and they didn&#x27;t hurt. I continued applying this throughout the day and really piled it on before bed. When I woke up the next morning, my hands were like completely new hands, as though nothing had ever happened. I was astonished. I almost cried because I hadn&#x27;t actually felt my hands being normal for at least six months, and this stuff fixed them when no other creams could. If you have dry hands, you must try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a face creme:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had initially thought this was WAY too greasy for a face cream, but I had forgotten to pack my normal stuff once on a trip and so tried this. Let me start by saying I have very dry skin, so I&#x27;m not sure this would be a great idea for someone who is acne prone. But really, this stuff transformed my face. Normally I&#x27;d have to periodically apply moisturizer to my face throughout the day to prevent flakes and I couldn&#x27;t wear any makeup that wasn&#x27;t extremely moisturizing. This, I apply it heavily before going to bed (after washing with a sonic brush) and when I wake up my skin looks dewy and fresh. A total transformation from the dull, flaky skin I normally woke up with. After using this for two months now, there is no way I&#x27;m ever switching away. The fine lines around my eyes are completely gone and the ones on my forehead are very faint. My skin glows like all those highlighter and illuminator products try to do and I have stopped having to wear foundation. I have very ruddy skin and the redness has been greatly reduced. I can wear face powders now and not worry about whether they will draw attention to flakiness because there are no flakes anymore. Even if I miss a day or two, my skin still feels really nice. I am so impressed with this lotion, I could go on for pages and pages about how much I love it. My mom has severely dry skin too and normally sticks to things in the $40+ price range, but nothing really works THAT well for her. I put some of this on one side of her face and it far outperformed her $50 cream and she wants her own. I also love that I don&#x27;t need a separate eye cream, I dab this around my eyes and it works great. If you have dry skin, you should definitely give this a shot. And if it doesn&#x27;t work on your face, you can always use it on your hands or feet.</li>
    <li> I would hate to try to experience winter without this stuff.  It works beautifully, better than anything else I have ever tried on my very-sensitive-to- winter hands.</li>
    <li> Excellent body cream for the cold Chicago winters. I love the feel and the very slight clean fragrance.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. But I do not find it any better than Eucerin or Aveeno, and the other two brands (particularly the last one) contain less artificial and hazardous ingredients, so I prefer using them.   My husband also uses Nivea body cream as after-shower moisturizer. I decided to try totally natural/organic Dr Broener&#x27;s lotions, and am amazed at their quality.</li>
    <li> I use Nivea Body Creme and find it gives me smooth skin during winters. I have been noticing however that the product is getting less effective over the years. It is still nice and the scent makes me nostalgic.</li>
    <li> I received a sample size of this product and decided to try it when I had a terrible head cold. My nose was so sore, any other cream or lotion hurt when applied. To my surprise, the Nivea Creme didn&#x27;t cause any stinging. I believe it also helped my skin to heal more quickly. I tried applying a small amount of the creme twice a day to my eyelids, which were dry and flaky from the head cold. Three days later, the skin on my eyelids felt moist and smooth.     A little goes a long way with this product. You don&#x27;t need to slather it on.</li>
    <li> This is my grandmas FAVORITE lotion and the ONLY one she will use. So for her birthday i had this sent to her house as a surprise gift in addition to what i gave her at her bday breakfast. She was SO happy that she called me right away raving about how she cant believe i got her not one but 3 jars of her favorite lotion. it was cute. 5 stars! &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I initially tried this when a coworker gave it as a stocking stuffer gift, a small cute tin.  In the summer time, my heels/feet get extremely dry and cracked.  I hate the feeling and have tried several heel lotions/products and nothing ever seemed to work.  So one evening I applied it to my feet, and saw instant results!  My heels were soft, even the next morning. I do use a generous amount to get the full effect and it&#x27;s my new best friend!  My husband teases me before bed, b/c I&#x27;ll say \\&quot;my feet are thirsty, they need NIVEA!!!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I originally bought a sample of this in a dollar store and used it on a scaly patch on my face that kept recurring.  I liked it so much I looked for larger jars.  They are hard to find in the stores.  I use it on my face and feet, and anywhere else a little eczema patch might crop up in the winter.  Don&#x27;t use it once and expect miracles, but persistence does pay off!  I even gave a jar to my grandson for his knees.</li>
    <li> My mother recommended this product to me because I have very dry peeling skin. I was very very very skeptical because the minute I put it on, I honestly hated it. It was very thick and sticky and left my face looking oily. But never-the-less, it also left it moisturized. But keep listening! [To take away the oily skin effect, you have to put powder. Any kind will do.]    That same day, two of my friends asked me if I did something different bc I \\&quot;look different.\\&quot; And they couldn&#x27;t figure it out. They just said \\&quot;you look prettier.\\&quot; So I continued to use it.    Couple months later my mom tells me a story about a 90 something y/o woman who looked 70ish. They jokingly asked her what her secret to youthful looking skin was and she said \\&quot;Nivea.\\&quot; She said she&#x27;s been using it all her life. I also noticed my own mom, who&#x27;s been using it she was 16. I have to say my mother looks 10 years younger. She&#x27;s 50 now, but looks to be early 40.    So yeah, if you want to look 10-20 years younger in the future, I would definitely recommend this product bc of all it&#x27;s success stories. I&#x27;m personally using the Nivea light because it isn&#x27;t sticky at all. But I have to say, I don&#x27;t think Nivea light will have the same long term moisturizing effects as the original Nivea. I believe the oilier and thicker it is, the better it is for your skin in the long run.</li>
    <li> This cream is inexpensive but very good, delivers moisture well, specially working well for dry skin. Nice fragrance too.The basic ingredients are as in the Cream de la Mer (minus the expensive sea broth), so, this explains the similarity of fragrance. Of course what stuff goes in which proportions in both creams, I can&#x27;t say, but I was thinking this will be an interesting note.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Got a travel size from a friend and then realized it&#x27;s the only lotion that I put on and don&#x27;t need more like an hour later. Non greasy and even has a pleasant but very subtle scent.  And proving was great on Amazon</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s grandfather has been using Nivea creme for many years and she says that this smell reminds her of her childhood. When our pediatrician, who is very old school, recommended this with our first child instead of diaper cream, we were skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised. Our first only had two bouts of diaper rash until he was potty trained and our second has only had it once in 18 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I myself have eczema during the dry winter months and use this to cure it. About two days of use relieves dry, chapped hands that are very scaly and red.</li>
    <li> Adore this product. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Started using this after visiting an aunt in Germany and have used it for a lifetime.  Now I have to get it online since it is very difficult to find regularly in my community.</li>
    <li> I praise the day I discovered this product after battling with psorasis on my hands for years this is the only product I have found that will help moisturize them without causing further breakouts. I have several co-workers who battle with dry hands during the cold winter months and they also concur that this is the best product they have found to battle dryness. I do want to mention two other benefits, this product is non-greasy and has a very light pleasant aroma. I Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Nivea is the Premiere lotion/creme.  Easy purchase.</li>
    <li> I buy this product in retail for $10 per jar. I got it here for $5 per jar. The product is amazing. I have been using it for 30 or so years daily!</li>
    <li> I use this on my feet year round, and my hands in the winter. It&#x27;s greasy for sure, but nothing beats it for making your skin super soft. Awesome that Amazon has this available for subscribe &amp; save.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very dry skin, we try all kind of cream before and she like this is the most.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand creme I know of.  It has a light pleasing fragrance. I use it every night.</li>
    <li> I have heard, over the years, a lot of hype about Nivea. I will be totally honest and say that I thought it was a product for little old ladies because I remember my Great Grandmother using it and I thought it had a sweet smell. Now that I&#x27;ve been looking for something to sooth my constantly dry skin I decided, based on the reviews here, to try it. I was wrong. Very wrong. It does have a slight sweet smell to it, in my opinion, but it&#x27;s not bad. Unlike some other lotions or creams my perfume does cover the smell and not compete with it. But I have noticed a huge difference in my skin. I put it on right out of the shower and it works magic. It&#x27;s great right after shaving as well! I am so in love with this that I gave a jar to my mother, who is having a problem with wrinkles and she loves it as well. Said that it has plumped up her wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Works as it always has for me the past 25 years.  Same formula that I guess some German company came up with generations ago</li>
    <li> I have severely dry skin and there&#x27;s absolutely no other lotion or cream on the market that works as well as Nivea Creme does.  I used to mix equal parts Vaseline with hand lotion, but that was too greasy (obviously).  This stuff is thick!  You could stand a pencil up in it.  In fact, it&#x27;s so thick that you can&#x27;t directly apply it to your skin; you have to put a dab on your palm, rub your palms together and then apply to the dry skin area.    I&#x27;ve tried Lubriderm, Keri, and Vaseline Intensive Care, to name a few. Seriously, no other cream or lotion works as well.</li>
    <li> I got this specifically for my heals and dry feet. It works great.  Lather ups and cover with socks and go to bed.  Overnight you will see the difference.</li>
    <li> I have used Nivea Creme for many years, and this is still the high quality cream I am used to.  Also, very inexpensive but moistures as good as, if not better, than other outrageously priced face creams on the market.  I will continue to buy Nivea till they quit making it.</li>
    <li> Very good body lotion.  for the face I recommend Nivea in the White Jar.  Sorry, I forget the name of it but it looks the same only white.</li>
    <li> very good,and so cheap suggest to buy,everyday moisture,especially winter  and spring,i like it!and i think you will like it also</li>
    <li> This Nivea Creme is the best for my sensitive skin. It is not too oily, does not cause blemishes and goes on smooth. Since I started using it years ago, I have not experienced dry skin. Although it is thick, it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my face. It can be used around the eyes without irritation, and it doesn&#x27;t run or glob up if you perspire. One of these containers lasts me several months. I highly recommend this product, especially for pre-aging and aging skin!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years I only wished it came in a bigger container.  It came promptly and was exactly as displayed.</li>
    <li> Very thick to apply on other than a diaper rash</li>
    <li> In the winter my hands and legs get exceedingly dry, and I have found that the ingredients of this cream work well for me. I like the petroleum and mineral oil. I was in Europe in the 1970&#x27;s and discovered Nivea while there. The lotions do not work for me, only the cream. The lotions are too thin, and are not any better than vaseline intensive care or lubriderm or cerve.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase...not so happy about having to come up with a limit of words that I have to use.</li>
    <li> This creme is a God send!! This helps the skin feel so much better almost instantly!! This creme was given to me by a lady that was nice enough to give me the rest of her jar when I was having a rash &amp; I&#x27;ve never looked back!! I used to look for this at the store but never again, I will always come here, it only took seconds to find instead of 1/2 hour!! Thanks so much for selling this wonderful creme &amp; making it so easy!!!</li>
    <li> Returned it as it wasn&#x27;t what I thought.</li>
    <li> The cream is old, it  separates and doesn&#x27;t go on smooth, watery</li>
    <li> There is nothing like a thick creme after a warm bath! I apply this to damp skin and the results are phenomenal! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This creme is so spectacular on my skin...I had to order in a three pack. As expected...this was delivered on time and remains a great product for me.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful I am using this every day , I am elderly and this is making a big difference. I will continue to order when needed and also for gifts.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this stuff while I was in the Netherlands this February 2011.  It was on sale and I bought several large tins and brought them back with me to the states.  I started using it and shortly after I went to Puerto Rico in March 2011 and caught an amazing deep, dark, healthy tan.  It has been nearly three weeks since I have arrived back home to NYC and I still have a pretty good tan thanks to Nivea Creme.  I used it every day, religiously, and find that my skin feels so much better and looks healthier.  It is really thick and like the other reviews say all you need to do is spread a little on your palms before using it on your body.  Trust me, you will be amazed!  I will continue to use this product and will stock up on it when I travel to Europe.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mom in AZ. Her skin gets really dry there and she&#x27;s 84. Almost nothing works, until she got this. She loves it. I tried to go online and order myself some, but unfortunately it appears Amazon makes it available only to &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34; members. Kind of silly, so I went to a box store and bought just one, instead of a three pack. It has a LOVELY smell that is fresh and clean. Takes so much less than lotion, and once you rub it in it LASTS and your skin really does feel moisturized. Great for legs!</li>
    <li> I would agree with all the positive reviews on this site. The product is hands down the ABSOLUTE BEST!! I&#x27;m a guy and I&#x27;ve been consistently using Nivea for a good while, and always get plenty of compliments on my skin. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer after shaving as well.</li>
    <li> The parent company for Nivea, Beiersdorf AG has been innovating in skincare for over 100 years. My family has been using Nivea for over 40 years - I feel no other cream lasts as long on the skin, makes it feel fresher and smoother. I&#x27;ve grown up with the fragrance of Nivea and love it, if you don&#x27;t like fragrant lotions/creams you can try Eucerin, also by the same company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this company stays autonomous and continues to build amazing skincare products forever.</li>
    <li> Great lotion.  Keeps the body moisturized and the price is great, too!  I have been buying it regularly for nearly a year now.</li>
    <li> Nivea cream is always the best to put on your face when it is cold outside :)&lt;br /&gt;Not only for your body, but mostly for the face.  The cream protects you and is very nice, without being greasy or smelling.&lt;br /&gt;The jars came on time and were well packaged. Thanks so much</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for at least 30 years and find it an absolute &#x27;wrinkle killer&#x27;. Yes, it&#x27;s a bit on the greasy site. Just wait half an hour after you put it on and remove any excess with a paper towel or give your hands a treatment by dabbing it off with the back of them. I do think that people with oily skin might have some problems by breaking out but if you have dry skin it should work for you.&lt;br /&gt;I knew it was for me when a 20something PA could not stop commenting on what &#x27;fantastic skin&#x27; I had.&lt;br /&gt;Does not work on fighting gravity though:(&lt;br /&gt;Btw. I never use makeup and I only use the original version of this product. Not the americanized &#x27;low fat&#x27; kind.</li>
    <li> I just tried Nivea creme for the first time today.  I bought a small 1oz tin from CVS for 99c, and now I kind of wish I had bought the larger size.&lt;br /&gt;My cuticles have gotten so dry, and painful lately that it was embarrassing to show my hands.  I applied a tiny dab of nivea to each finger tip, and after a couple hours, my cuticles looked 10X better. I usually have to use cuticle oil for a week to get these kind of results!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how this stuff works so quickly, or so well, but I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using it.  I can&#x27;t wait to try it on my face.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED A SET OF NIVEA CREME FROM THIS SELLER AND ONCE I RECEIVED IT,IT TURNS OUT THAT THE CREME IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO RUB INTO YOUR SKIN AND THEN THE DAMN CREME GAVE ME A RASH ON MY HAND. UPON CONTACTING THE SELLER IM TOLD I WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RETURN FEE FOR A PRODUCT THAT GAVE ME A RASH AND REQUIRES 20 MINUTES OF RUBBING TO DISSOLVE. THE SELLERS ATTIUDE AND RESPONSE IS VERY UNACCEPTABLE...STATING THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO INSPECT THE ITEM..I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN A PICTURE OF MY RASH FOR THEM TO INPECT AS WELL. I AM A FREQUENT SHOPPER ON AMAZON.COM BUT WILL MAKE SURE I NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER...CUSTOMER SERVICE GOES ALONG WAY...AND THEIRS SUCKS.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It hydrates extremely well and stays on the skin so much better than a regular lotion. I use it most during the winter months. A little goes a long way too.</li>
    <li> Best Cream in the World! I use it on my face every night and wake up to supple skin that looks soft and plumb.&lt;br /&gt;Was afraid of breakouts because it is a very thick cream, like a buttercream, but haven&#x27;t had any. Don&#x27;t recommend for oily skin (I have normal/dry skin) on the face. But highly recommend for everyone on the body. Keeps you moisturized throughout the day. Don&#x27;t expect it to last on your hands after washing them, no moisturizer in the world lasts thru a good hand wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been using this cream over a year and can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.</li>
    <li> I was even able to discontinue oatmeal baths for my daughter.  The thickness of the cream makes it stay on the skin much, much longer than any body lotion (medicated or otherwise) would.  However, I realize that the effectiveness would vary from person to person.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this creme. It is the only one I use. It&#x27;s thick and not greasy. It is also one of the only ones that does not cause me to break out. I used to go through the tiny tins super fast,  so I was glad to finally find it in these tubs.</li>
    <li> love this product great value for the money will buy again</li>
    <li> I love Nivea products.  However, this creme is extremely dense and rubs on slowly.  For some, this may be more moisturizing.  For me, it is slow to apply but disappears quickly from the jar.  You have to use a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer the lotion pump after this experience which applies and covers thoroughly and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JD</li>
    <li> For years after taking showers my skin became incredibly dry and itchy to the point where it almost hurt, no matter how much lotion I used it never got better until I used Nivea Creme. This stuff is magic. With the first use my skin stopped itching and I almost wanted to cry because I was so relieved. It&#x27;s incredibly thick and a little hard to run onto dry skin so I typically use it when I&#x27;m still a little damp from the shower. I also walk around naked for about 20 minutes to let it fully absorb lol. If you have very problematic dry skin I fully advise you try this. I buy the giant 400ml glass jars at my local Target.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite moisturizer - it&#x27;s thick and absorbs beautifully.  It even works to heal my husband&#x27;s cracked fingers in the winter!</li>
    <li> Nivea is one of those tried and true products that has stuck around all these years for a reason. My great grandmother was from Germany and used Nivea throughout her life, and she had beautiful, soft skin until her death in her mid-80s. It is a thick and slightly oily cream, but I think this is probably why it&#x27;s more effective over most creams and lotions. I use it primarily on my hands and feet, but also on my face during the winter months. I&#x27;ve never had a breakout from it and it really does bring your skin to life-- I&#x27;ve noticed a smooth tone to my face after using it. I&#x27;m also a type 1 diabetic and get dry skin all over my body, and this is always what I go-to solution for it.  The scent has always remained the same—kind of floral, kind of citrusy—and the thickness of it means a little goes a long way. I always make sure I have a jar of this stuff for the winter months, because it truly saves my skin from drying out, peeling, and becoming seriously uncomfortable. The small traveling tins are also great.</li>
    <li> This cream has been a staple in my household since childhood. Excellent for dry skin especially during cold winter months. I buy in bulk to save money.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT GIVE MY WIFE MUM AND MOTHER-IN-LAW FOR MOTHER&#x60;S DAY</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer for severely dry skin.  EVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My VVSP and I are both geezers, which means that our skin tends to be dry.  We are active and we get our hands dirty.  This is what we use, and it&#x27;s the only non-facial moisturizer we use.  We keep a jar in the car as well as several at home and the office.  It&#x27;s heavy and oily, but it soaks in quickly and lasts a long time.  It is prohibitively expensive to buy individually in the stores where we live, but ordering it three jars at a time from Amazon Subscribe and Save cuts the cost substantially and ensures that we don&#x27;t run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love this stuff.  Seriously.</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible.  All of the nivea moisturizers are amazing, and great for any skin irritation.  But the original blue 6.8 oz. bottle with the white cream is amazing.  Use it as aftershave, and you will become addicted in such a good way.  Years ago I would cry about razor burn, but those days are just a memory.  Ladies, try it in your private area, that sounds so fun!!!</li>
    <li> I use Nivea creme to stay moisturized in general and because I have atopic dermatitis.  The dermatologist recommended I use a heavy moisturizer creme.  I sometimes also use Cetaphil, Aquaphor and other quality moisturizer creams.  Nivea is very good quality and adds some perfume and wax to the typical mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea is very sticky, tacky and thick. It has an old-fashioned fragrance that I like. It goes on white until it is rubbed in.  So, don&#x27;t accidentally get any on your dark clothes before leaving for work.  The virtue of Nivea being so sticky is that it really protects your skin much longer than most competitors, 6 hours or so depending on conditions. With Cetaphil (a good product too), I have to reapply throughout the day.  Nivea only needs morning and night applications, maybe mid-afternoon also if my skin is very dry or acting up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use it anywhere you are prone to oily pimples. This is a heavy moisturizer.  Most people will only want to use it on their body, but I use it moderately on my face and neck too because an occasional pimple is better than the dry, itchy, flaky rashes that can happen with atopic dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people like to get the European formulation which lacks Petrolatum.  I have both German and american Nivea.  I lived in Europe and had to use the European formula for a long time.  I actually prefer the american formula with petrolatum. It seems smoother and easier to work into the skin. The european formula is waxier. I find no real evidence that petrolatum is dangerous. It is very good at protecting skin from dryness and is widely used without being a toxin.  I sometimes buy the European formula because it comes in an old-fashioned tin which is fun to re-use for collar stays, ear-rings or my daughter&#x27;s barrettes.  Having the old tins around reminds me of my grandma, bless her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this size of tub, 6.8 oz (192g).  It&#x27;s not too big.  With cremes in a tub, you don&#x27;t want too big a tub.  Furthermore, each person should have their own tub.  By dipping fingers, it is possible to spread germs, etc.  I like a smallish tub so that one tub doesn&#x27;t last too long and have a chance to pick up too many germs, viruses, bacterias, etc.  A pack of 3 tubs in this size is perfect.  I would use pumps, but all pump moisturizers are just not thick enough to work effectively. Some actually dry and irritate skin. I find that true by my experience and it is what my dermatologist told me. Always apply with clean-washed hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try Nivea.  It is a classic because it works.  The formula is quality. It can be difficult to put on, but it is more effective than most other moisturizers.</li>
    <li> i have been using Nivea Creme for over 50 years and it has been consistently great. I have sensitive skin and most creams and lotions give me a rash. Nivea is healing.</li>
    <li> I have terribly dry skin from head to toe. I used to purchase very expensive creams(specifically for my face) but nothing seemed to keep my skin moisturized AND nice looking. My mother has had this product in her bathroom for as long as I can remember. She would always put it on me as a child but I hated how oily it was! My mother is now 62 and people are in literal shock when I tell them... They usually think she&#x27;s in her late 40&#x27;s!! This product is literally all she&#x27;s used (and continues to use) and now, I&#x27;ve begun to use it myself and notice a HUGE difference in my skin! I usually put it on before I go to bed. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is obviously, more moisturized, my pores are much smaller and my face has a glow to it and just looks healthier overall! I&#x27;ve also quit using concealer/face makeup products because my skin has improved THAT much! Also, when I was pregnant, I broke out like crazy!! What helped?? Using Nivea at night (I had stopped using it) before I got pregnant!! I love this product so much and I hope it helps many of you out as much as it has with my momma and I! Again, it&#x27;s very oily so I recommend using it before bed! You may also not like the scent but I don&#x27;t mind it :) Hope my review has helped at least one of you!</li>
    <li> My local Target stopped selling this and I could only find the new &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; formula which is useless for me. This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that is not oily like Eucerin but still thick enough for dry rough skin on my feet and hands. Truth be told, I even use what&#x27;s left on my hands and run it through my hair. It makes it settle down and leaves it shiny all day. The smell is a great clean scent not perfumey.</li>
    <li> Very thick. Too thick. Hard to rub in. Nivea Soft is much better.</li>
    <li> I have dermatitis so it&#x27;s always scary for me to try a new product, but after reading the good reviews, I decided to go for it. Didn&#x27;t work for me - ended up getting a rash.  The cream itself is very sticky as well.  I couldn&#x27;t rub it on, like literally couldn&#x27;t, it was so sticky.  It has a very waxy texture.  Ended up trying Cetaphil after and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle cure-all for me!  Heals nearly overnight.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, I originally purchased as a gift but then bought some of my own. Keeps skin soft but not smelling feminine.</li>
    <li> Nivea is perfect for my combination skin. I tried various over-the-counter and very expensive products, including organic. But none of them worked. They did well for the oily portions of my skin, but my cheeks were ridiculously dry and rough especially during winter. As a kid I grew up with Nivea, so decided to try it. It worked perfectly!! I use another cream as a base and apply Nivea on my driest areas. My hands also get very dry during winter because I keep washing them to stay away from flu, and Nivea works the best! I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it for dry and combination skin. Of course for combination you have to apply only in dry areas, if I use this in oily areas it may cause me to breakout since I find this product a bit oily.</li>
    <li> I am 66, when I was 30 a man from India told me his wife only will use Nivea. I have used it for 36 yrs. People say I look 50. It gets to the point I only need it in winter. Summer takes care of it&#x27;s self.</li>
    <li> I have eczema, and have tried everything from Cetaphil (which I&#x27;m allergic to due to the wheat) and other expensive creams and moisturizers. Almost every one of them has left me with dry, peeling skin and a rash. I&#x27;ve heard of Nivea, and first used one of their products a few months back when I was allowed to try their in-shower body lotion. It was the most moisturizing lotion I&#x27;ve ever used, but had to discontinue using it due to the fragrance that I was allergic to. So, I decided to pick up the Nivea Creme to start using on my face, to see if that would help with my severe eczema. I have scarring for acne and eczema. The creme has helped tremendously, moisturizing my skin, and taming the flakes and itching. I&#x27;m not sure it will work for everyone, but this has been the only moisturizer that has worked for me. The skin on my face is super soft, and my damaged skin is looking better. Happily, after several weeks of use, my skin seems to be improving.</li>
    <li> I have mild eczema during the winter, I used to use Cetaphil but it would still leave me itching. Switched to this stuff, I&#x27;m never going back. It is a thick paste that is a little difficult to rub in but once you do it doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy or oily.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. The scent is really nice and understated. In the morning I use it on my elbows and knees. At night I use it on my legs and arms. I also like to put it on my feet before bed and then put socks on after to sleep in. It&#x27;s a very thick cream, so you have to allow plenty of time for it to soak in. I&#x27;ve noticed that in the winter months it definitely helps keep my skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> My sister has very sensitive, fair skin and when she was a teen she, of course, had acne. My mom gave her nivea cream and I couldn&#x27;t believe it was all gone in a week or two. She never used anything else on her face. Ever since then I used it because it is very healing for skin. I never thought of it as a moisturizer or as too think, just as a necessary healer of the skin. Would you stop eating vegetables because of an unpleasant after taste? No, because it is good for your body. it is hard for me to understand why \\&quot;too thick\\&quot; is a valid excuse for not using this miracle healer. Go figure.</li>
