<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am happy with the product and my eyes feel and look better. The dark circles and puffiness have faded and I hope to see more improvement as it has only been a few weeks.</li>
    <li> worked great i can see improvement in my skin already!</li>
    <li> Works better than other products I&#x27;ve tried for puffiness &amp; dark circles. I recently found out I had sleep apnea so I was looking pretty haggard in the mornings. This product definitely helped reduce most of the puffiness 1st thing in the morning. I didn&#x27;t have really dark circles under my eyes, just a slight darkening. After a couple of weeks that started to go away. I like the smell of the product &amp; the fact that you only have to use a tiny bit. I&#x27;m having problems w/ my insurance on the sleep apnea stuff so I still don&#x27;t have a cpap machine which means I&#x27;m still not getting any good sleep at night. So I know it&#x27;s this product that&#x27;s helping. I don&#x27;t know how well it works on wrinkles because I don&#x27;t really have any. Overall, I don&#x27;t think this is a miracle product but it has been effective over time and I will probably buy again (which might be a while because you only use a tiny bit at a time!). Like I said earlier, it works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for a few weeks and I really like it. I like that it is light and a little goes a long way, so I will have this bottle for a while. Fortunately, I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles around my eyes and I really think this cream will help me to stay that way for a while.</li>
    <li> I give it one star for not burning/stinging my sensitive eyes, another star for the medicinal/tea tree oil scent which is pleasant to me and that it dissipates once the cream absorbs into the skin, a final 3rd star for being non-greasy. But it does not work for me in reducing the puffiness or wrinkles around my eyes. It comes out runny and does not absorb immediately for me; but once it absorbs into the skin around my eye area, I was able to apply my makeup with no problem. I was really hoping that this is the miracle cream for my eyes based on the many 5-star reviews here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 11, 2015: After over a month of using this day and night, I still did not see any improvement. It did not cause any milia around my eye areas, so I will finish the bottle but not purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aug 2, 2015: Still using this product, but only once a day, sparingly. I tried it around my lip corners, since I could not see any difference around my eye areas, and it did NOT work at all. I know for sure, since I used it morning and night for 7 days straight, and as soon as I switched back to my other facial moisturizing product (a popular Japanese brand), I saw immediate results on the corner of my lips that had some wrinkly lines. Giving it 2 stars for not irritating my sensitive eyes and for not causing milia.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this eye cream. I did see an immediate difference. My husband recently told me how young I look today :). I just reordered this product. Round 2. Let&#x27;s see how much younger I can look.</li>
    <li> I needed an eye cream that works well and reasonably priced. And this product accomplished that. You only need a very small amount to cover both your eyes. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> great product!!! I saw signs that my Dark circles have diminished!!! I am completely happy with this product!!! I recommended this product to everyone I  because they are the one that saw the difference even before I myself even saw it.</li>
    <li> It really helps to smooth out fine lines. I&#x27;ve tried many eye cremes. Some help a bit but are either too expensive or irritating. This doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes or cause a rash. I like the fact that it&#x27;s not tested on animals and that it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive. Plus it&#x27;s made in the USA.</li>
    <li> I read all these amazing reviews, so I order it. I only used a few times because it smells (reminds me of Mentholatum, which I certainly don&#x27;t want near my eyes!) and when I did struggle through the oder, was not impressed with results. It&#x27;s like I received the wrong product based on its claims.</li>
    <li> fast shipping, i hope it gonna work well</li>
    <li> Cream is very nice consistency. I have had trouble in the past with eye creams being either too oily and/or too heavy with little effect. Best eye cream yet!</li>
    <li> I have been using  Eye Cream For Dark Circle  for some time now. I had medium dark circles, mostly under my eyes, and moderate puffiness. Using it once or twice a day, the darkness went from medium (which most folks see on themselves as hideous and disfiguring. . .) to mild rather quickly. The puffiness is a bit better, but just a bit. I am hopeful that with continued use that both issues will be reduced. However, this product has definitely improved the appearance of the skin around my eyes. It is an effective moisturizer, and seems to decrease the puffiness of the old eye bags. Importantly, it does not irritate the eyes, and has no obnoxious scent.i received a free sample in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased three different eye treatment products from Amazon over time. None of them has been of any value, including this one. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it now. The texture feels good. But now I haven&#x27;t noticed that much change around my eyes, probably because the area around my eyes are so dark, I think it&#x27;s genetic, don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;ll change....</li>
    <li> I was excited to try the Body Merry Eye Cream for several reasons. I&#x27;m in my 30s and have occasional dark circles under my eyes and undereye puffiness when I don&#x27;t get enough sleep. I am always looking for a product that works to get rid of those. This product appeals to me because it is full of natural ingredients like Vitamins and essential oils. I am a big believer in the power of essential oils and antioxidants applied to the skin. Main anti-aging ingredients include Matrixyl 3000, Tripeptide 5 and Hyaluronic Acid. Matrixyl is known for helping improve the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Tripeptide 5 increases collagen production. Hyaluronic Acid helps skin retain moisture so it stays soft and smooth. I have used other products containing these ingredients, but this is the first product I have found that uses all three of them together. This eye cream is a powerhouse of anti-aging ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report that Age Defense Eye Cream really works! I use just a small dot of the cream under each eye in the mornings and the evenings. I have sensitive skin, and this cream has never caused any type of dryness or irritation whatsoever. It is very hydrating and goes on and into my skin very easily. It does not take long to start seeing the results, either. I think my undereye areas look start looking better nearly instantly. Puffiness goes down and the skin feels soft. Over time, my dark circles have started to fade away. I&#x27;m using this product at the same time as Body Merry&#x27;s Retinol Surge Moisturizer and Hyaluronic Serum, so I think between the 3 of these products, my skin&#x27;s appearance has really improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing I would like to mention is that I really like the convenient pump bottle design. It makes it easy to dispense the small amount of cream I need without wasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream free for review purposes. All opinions expressed are my own, based on personal experiences with the product.oduct.</li>
    <li> This cream works really well I love it!</li>
    <li> It did nothing for me, i wonder all those good reviews are real or not. it felt good on the skin but did change nothing.</li>
    <li> I do believe this caused hives around my eyes.  It was the only thing that had changed in my daily regimen.  Too bad, I was hopeful that it would help with my dark circles.</li>
    <li> Love this product...i have very sensitive skin and it hasn&#x27;t caused any rash .</li>
    <li> I have been using Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream for about a month now, and I love it! Has it made my 52-year-old eye area look like the eyes of a 20-year-old? No. But, I have noticed positive changes. The puffiness and darkness under my eyes has decreased. Wrinkles seem to have smoothed out a bit. My eye area looks fresher. I will continue to use this product because I have noticed a difference and I am betting with another few weeks, there will be more positive progress. The lotion has a green, very natural fragrance that I find pleasant. It feels rich and absorbs quickly into my skin. All in all, I really like it!</li>
    <li> it moisturizes well and a little goes a long way. the pump dispenses way too much product so you only need a half pump or less. i noticed little difference when using it but im sure with prolonged use, the results would be more noticeable</li>
    <li> I really needed this product and have been delighted by how it works.</li>
    <li> First off its a huge bottle for an eye cream and will last at least 6-9 months! The smell is a little funny and I wish it was a thicker consistency because I use it at night! I have only used it for two days and noticed it does help my under eye puffiness and tone! Not irritating and I feel good knowing I&#x27;m using an all natural product!</li>
    <li> Iv been using faithfully for 2-3 weeks and no results. ill keep tryin but so far nothing</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and have noticed the skin under my eyes are brighter and less puffy. I see a noticeable difference already. I am very happy I came across this product.</li>
    <li> Great eye cream!  It&#x27;s very soothing!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything ...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything at all for me. Really unhappy. Trusted the reviews so I decided to give it a try. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Feels nice around the eyes.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT SELLER!!!!!  Unfortunately this didn&#x27;t help my dark circles but the seller refunded me after I had been using it almost a month. If dark circles are not your problem this would be a great eye cream since it is light weight and goes on smoothly and absorbs.</li>
    <li> Really like this eye cream.  Goes on smooth and seems to help with the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Love the way in feels going onto my skin but I bought this product mainly for my dark circles and after applying twice a day, morning and night until the bottle was gone,  for me it just did it not help.</li>
    <li> moisturizes eyes. Feel great.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eye cream. I actually use it all over as a moisturizer. If you are looking for something that tightens the skin this is not the product for you. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer, I love the way it smells! It has a very subtle green tea lime smell and leaves no oily residue. I recommend this eye cream!</li>
    <li> My mother used to say, &amp;#34;Old age doesn&#x27;t come alone&amp;#34;.  She was right.  Big brown eyes sometimes show big brown under eye circles.  This is a rich cream that makes a significant difference.  I really like it!</li>
    <li> I am 36 and I&#x27;ve been using this product for three months. I use it on my entire face and neck. Its an awesome product-- I noticed the most improvement with the my eyes; my once puffy, finely wrinkled under eye skin is smooth and not puffy. Around my eyes are smoother and my eyelids tighter. I will continue using this product and plan to search body merry&#x27;s line of products first for future needs. For the price and effectiveness of this product I 100% say buy it.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome eye cream and I have tried many before this one. Creamy and goes on smooth. It does not take much to apply around the eye area also. I will order this product again.</li>
    <li> I have eyebags and puffy eyes because I always sleep late so an eye cream really is a necessity for me. This eye cream really lived up to its promises and I am very satisfied of it. The puffiness is gone and my eyebags look lighter after just a few weeks of using it. I cannot imagine what more it could do after a few more weeks of using it.</li>
    <li> Will purchase in the future</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month in combination with the 2.5% retinol serum. I have NOT noticed any improvement in my dark circles, but I have noticed subtle improvement around my eyes.  My skin feels tighter and smooth and my fine lines DO look less prominent. Not a miracle product of course, but it does work for me.</li>
    <li> I got this product to try for free and I love it! It totally works! Being a single mom with a toddler tornado who doesn&#x27;t like to sleep I&#x27;ve had some very dark circles under my eyes lately and lets just say after using this - there is no more from my lack of sleep. I go out of the house looking like I&#x27;ve had a perfect night sleep whether I actually slept 3hrs or 10hrs.&lt;br /&gt;It has a great smell and you only need a tiny drop about the size of a pea for both eyes to have it work it&#x27;s magic.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to make their face feel brighter.</li>
    <li> I am ordering this wonderful eye cream again.</li>
    <li> This a great American made product, with 100% refund if not satisfied..I was satisfied with the product and the communication from the owner was wonderful!! They really stand by their product, I will return to purchase more products from this company!!! Thanks so much</li>
    <li> good eye cream.  goes on smooth and is non greasy.  can use during day or night and under makeup.  after a few days of using, it makes your tired looking eyes alive again. dark circles and puffiness gone.  and helps firm your skin to reduce the appearance of wrinkles around your eyes.</li>
    <li> i love the herbal smell! its light not sure it works but I feel good using this product.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, the feel, the price!</li>
    <li> It reduced my dark circles and small wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Works very well, has softened my lines around my eyes quite a bit!  I also use it around my mouth for those lines and it seems to be helping there too.  Goes on very light and absorbs well.  No toxic smells.  Very happy with this cream.</li>
    <li> As I get older, I find that I am fighting harder each day to keep the wrinkles at bay.  I am constantly on the lookout for products that actually work for distressed skin, so when I was asked by Body Merry to try out their Age Defense Eye Cream, you can bet I was all over that.  After using the product for approximately one month, I saw a substantial difference in the appearance of my skin.  Although I didn&#x27;t have problems with dark circles under my eyes, puffiness and fine lines remain two of my biggest issues. Could the Age Defense Eye Cream really work like they claimed it would?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received my package, I was impressed with the pump dispenser itself. It is one of the most easy to use and fit very well in my hand. When using the dispenser, you need to be careful not to dispense too much. Usually just one pump is more than enough to cover the areas under and around your eyes.  This is one of those products where a little goes a long way. You can feel safe in knowing that it is well worth the money and will last quite a while. I know this product is intended to treat puffy eyes, dark circles and wrinkles but I also apply it to my neck twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Age Defense Eye Cream has a very light and pleasant fragrance.  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy which is a plus in my book. This cream is also very good for those who may have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some high expectations for this Age Defense Eye cream and I was pleasantly surprised with the results.  I would like to thank Body Merry for helping my skin feel moisturized, hydrated and and most of all, for giving me my glow back.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 4 weeks, and I love the results, the dark circles have gotten lighter. I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  For me, it does everything it says it does and I love the ingredients in this product.  I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  My eyes are very sensitive so there&#x27;s not many products that I can use on them.  It is great for puffy eyes as well as helping with the fine lines.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
    <li> A very small pearl size amount is enough for my whole  hand. Even though it has a very light weight texture, almost like a gel, it is very hydrating.You need a very small amount. If you pump one full pump, as I did when I first got it, you will be able to your whole face.  I recommend pushing the pump less than half way down and go very slowly till you know what works for you.  You do not want to waste any. You can read my full review at hopesbeautybar.com</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks now, and I have noticed a reduction in the puffiness under my eyes. I am not a young woman, and I have had puffy bags under my eyes for quite awhile. I have tried several other products without the results I am getting from Body Merry. The lotion is very light and slick with little to no odor at all. I will be a repeat costumer.</li>
    <li> I feel like I am finally at a stage in my life where I have to take really good care of my skin. I am in my mid thirties now and I have noticed the signs of aging and I feel this helps my eyes not look so tired.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product with high hopes after reading the wonderful reviews and I was not disappointed. Before my first use, I washed my face free of make up and applied it before going to bed. It&#x27;s a small bottle but it really doesn&#x27;t take much at all. I found it to be very gentle and the smell is heavenly. In fact, after applying, I jumped into bed and gave my husband a quick kiss before going to sleep and he stopped and asked. &amp;#34;What is that smell? It&#x27;s amazing.&amp;#34; The next morning, I was a bit disappointed after not seeing a huge difference but I was going off of what a few ratings said about their dark circles practically vanishing over night. But, like they always say, everyone is different. I&#x27;m 23 but after 18, my dark circles and slightly puffy eyes have only darkened since then and I was at my wits end trying to cover them up. It took 3 days of applying it day and night to notice a difference and I was thrilled. I&#x27;ve always had that &amp;#34;Exhausted&amp;#34; look. It didn&#x27;t matter if I had slept 10 hours the night before, the dark circles were ever present to make me appear like the walking dead. I still have some shadowing but nothing that I can&#x27;t hide with a little concealer and before, even that wouldn&#x27;t cover it.This is the only product I&#x27;ve used that has made a significant difference and I&#x27;m very, very pleased with it. Not only for the effectiveness but also that it&#x27;s all natural and isn&#x27;t tested on animals.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is phenomenal!! It really works well. I was sent a free bottle to try, from the company. The first night I used it, after I woke up the following morning, I saw results instantly. The issues I needed the cream for most were dark circles, and puffiness around my eyes. Well after using this cream for over a month every night, before sleep, I have NO puffiness, and my dark circles are fading. It really is obvious that my eyes are looking more revived. I am in my early 30&#x27;s so I did not have too many fine lines and crows feet, but for the issues I did have I am completely satisfied in the way this cream helped. I really love and I have so much left, possibly enough to last the next 6 months, or more. A&#x3D;In regards to shipping, that process was smooth as can be. Body Merry is AWESOME!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this did not work on improving my dark circles.  However, the customer service was excellent.  Provided a refund; no questions asked.</li>
    <li> Ok but doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> This eye cream has worked wonders for my eyes. It really helped with the depuffing of the bags under my eyes. I didn&#x27;t see a huge change with the lightening of dark circles, but mine are genetic so I didn&#x27;t expect it to completely mask them. I like the packaging of this product, the pump is perfect. It makes sure none goes to waste and it gives you just the right amount. Overall, this product is amazing, and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I Like This Product. It&#x27;s Gentle, Moisturizing And Laugh Lines Are Less Noticeable. I Will Buy Again!</li>
    <li> I used this product for a while but I don&#x27;t see any significant difference around under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is nice and smooth but it smells pretty strong.</li>
    <li> Been using for about 3 weeks.  Have seen a slight improvement with the skin around the eyes. Both upper and lower part of the eyes seem a bit firm and less dark. Product smells very nice.</li>
    <li> It seems like a good product, but the smell was so strong (and not pleasant) that I couldn&#x27;t use it. I tried, but it was very strong and did not dissipate quickly.  I could still smell it 30-40 minutes later.</li>
    <li> Love this, works fast. Seeing results very quickly. Shipped faster then expected. Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> As close to a miracle cream that you can get! Thought I was plagued with hereditary dark circles thanks to my mom, but this cream made a serious impact!  Dark circles didn&#x27;t disappear totally but they diminished significantly and the puffiness was gone!  Fine lines and crows feet were less noticeable too.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I gave this a try.  Definitely compares to the high priced creams with half the cost. I battle with crepiness around the eyes and this takes care of it very well. Pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> BODY MERRY AGE DEFENSE EYE CREAM,  I LIKE IT.  IT SMELL GOOD TO ME  KEEP AROUND MY EYES SKIN MOISTURE AND SOFT, BUT I DON&#x27;T SEE ANY DIFFERENT FROM MY FACE.&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT DISCOUNT PRICE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t notice any relief from circles or darkness under the eyes. It does soak in fast and allow me to put on concealer though.</li>
    <li> Received my eye cream and started using it this week. Be careful on the first pump. Pump very slowly as you have to prime it. The pump is very sensitive and as soon as it starts will expell a large amount if you aren&#x27;t careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need a small amount to go a long way. It has a light scent that reminds me of some of my daughters essential oils. I apply it on my eyelids up to my eyebrows, around the outside of my eyes, and below my eyes. It causes no irritation to my eyes. It isn&#x27;t oily and absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says it can take 6-8 weeks to see results, as most products of this type do. I have taken some before pictures and will update my review later to see how it is going.</li>
    <li> I use this cream morning and night.  It does not irritate my skin in any way and makeup goes on smoothly.  I believe it is helping my under-eye area a great deal.  Thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> Had to return eye cream because of eye irritation. If you have sensitive skin do not order.</li>
    <li> I recently received this to review and was so shocked with my results an how much I fell in love with it! I have never really used any eye creams before other than this one an I loved this cream! Not only does it help with puffines, but also helps with wrinkles, sagging, lines an darkness! I really loved this cream because it was not to thick an not to thin! It never made my eyes burn or skin sting, which I loved because most creams will do that! I really loved the smell it smelt so fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> This really does work! Dark circles diminished quickly, and bags are gone! And a little drop goes a long way! I&#x27;d definitely recommend for those with dark circles!</li>
    <li> Eye cream feels nice but after one month (2x daily) there is no improvement to dark circles or puffiness.  I was hoping this cream would work but it does not for me.  I will continue to use it until the bottle is empty to see if continued use will improve results.  I even took a photo on day 1 to compare and there is no improvement. :(</li>
    <li> I usually never take time to write reviews. When I read the reviews for this product I thought they had to be fake!!! For some reason I still ordered and I love this!!! Its not a miracle worker you don&#x27;t wake up the next day 10 years younger. I have allergies and I am in my late 40&#x27;s one day I woke up and had bags and dark circles and I still have them! They just aren&#x27;t as bad! I really can tell a difference in a little over a months time. I will purchase again !!!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and it really helps with puffiness, plus it make my eye area feel refreshed.</li>
    <li> I reviewed this product for I love to review. I have bad circles under my eyes and this product really worked for me. My friend even asked what I did to get rid of my circles under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Great product works very well for dark circles and also smells like Vicks which is another plus for me 😊 would definitely repurchase</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have a problem with it stinging my skin like other products.  It is helping with fine lines and smells good.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin around my eyes from allergies and such and I have found this cream to soothing and Ive seen a difference in the smoothness of the skin.</li>
    <li> My go-to eye cream before Body Merry was Clinique All About the Eyes Rich.  I am 32 with wrinkles and darkish circles under my eyes but I don&#x27;t have bags or puffiness.  I&#x27;ve been using this Age Defense Eye cream every morning and night for over a month and am loving it.  It seems to be helping my crows feet, although they are pretty deep so it&#x27;s hard to tell.  The essential oils in it smell divine and don&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  I even apply under eye makeup immediately after applying this and it still lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t run.  I appreciate that a small amount goes a long way and the pump bottle allows you to dispense as much or little as you want.  I will definitely be ordering this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Very thin lotion, wouldn&#x27;t even call it moisturizer. I&#x27;m going to start writing reviews since I spend enough money with Amazon, these people getting things free for a review sets up a very false rating score for products. This stuff is worthless.</li>
    <li> The smell is delicious!  This cream is very gentle and not greasy at all!  So far I love it.</li>
    <li> Good product!! Will buy it again!!</li>
    <li> I have very oily under eyes/eye area in general. Every eye moisturizer I have tried made me a greasy pig but this works very well! Only complaint is that the pump is a little hard to control.</li>
    <li> Its great! came fast and feels wonderful!</li>
    <li> Great product! My eyes feel refreshed when I put this on in the morning! its light but creamy. Not greasy but does not fade. My eye bags have disappeared almost completely. I look like I&#x27;ve been in a spa for a few weeks! The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest but its not terrible. I received this a discount price and would recommend this to anyone looking to banish their eye bags and wrinkles or to at least lessing them!</li>
    <li> I have extensive sun damage to the skin on my face, coupled with losing 80lbs so my skin is way less than flawless or even smooth. I have been using the eye cream for a few weeks and see softening of the lines around my eyes and brightening of the skin around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Great smell. Keeps eyes refreshed and has improved brightness.</li>
    <li> Impressive! Does work great for dark circles!! Seeing great results!</li>
    <li> love this cream, does exactly as promised.</li>
    <li> Have not seen any improvement so far. I will finish using all of this cream.  But am not sure I will buy any more.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice difference! But will continue use</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple days and I can already see a big difference. Worth the time, and money. It didn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky feeling like some other products I&#x27;ve tried, and it doesn&#x27;t have a scent which I really appreciate in an eye cream. Something I&#x27;d buy again!</li>
    <li> Works great for bags and dark circles under your eyes. Takes about a month of daily use for the full effect. Prefer it to brand creams which have fragrance added to them - which irritate my eyes. This has a fragrance, but it is part of the formula.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the feel of this right when I put it on.  It has that tingly sensation as it starts to dry so be prepared for that.  It does help somewhat but I recommend using it morning and night to get the full benefits of this!</li>
    <li> I did not love the eye cream. It&#x27;s moisturizing enough, I suppose, but not as dramatic as expected from the product description. However, I will give 5++ stars to the company, as they were very invested in my satisfaction and gave me great customer service. Just based off that, I would buy something else from them. Worth taking a chance to see if you like this product.</li>
    <li> I have been used to using high dollar medical grade eye cream and wanted to give my skin a break so I decided on trying body merry.  I absolutely love it!  It has been a wonderful eye cream and I am very satisfied with the product.  This is one I will keep around!</li>
    <li> I have used this for 2 months and see some difference but do like the product</li>
    <li> Definitely seems to be making a difference. Looks a little smoother under the eyes, and bags not as pronounced - would recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about a month now and love it. The smell is pleasing. I like putting it on as part of my bedtime routine because the fragrance is lovely to fall asleep with. The texture is not too thick or too greasy as I have found with other eye creams. I use it both morning and night and feel that my skin is softer and less &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; looking.</li>
    <li> 26 year old using it for preventative care.&lt;br /&gt;Loving it already, it&#x27;s cleared up what fine lines I had and made me look far far far far less tired.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had the product long at all and I&#x27;m noticing the difference.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the consistency is perfect that I apply it in the morning and let it set in a moment before applying makeup. Not oily or heavy.</li>
    <li> Good product although the packaging (noticed that they re-packaged it recently) that I received was very hard to read. That said, good ingredients in this product. Not so keen on the retinol in the eye cream as there is no percentage listed and I&#x27;ve used retinols on my eyes and they are very irritating. However based on my experience with these products, the retinol could actually be retinyl palmitate, a precursor to retinol. I would also like the % listed of the Matrixyl 3000 as it does make a difference to how effective the cream is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried this it was moisturizing, not greasy and I could apply makeup over it. I would recommend as a starter eye-cream for people new to skincare.</li>
    <li> I love that way this product feels and smells!  I even love the pump on the bottle.  However, I purchased this price for fine lines, puffiness under my eyes.  It&#x27;s been at least 3 weeks and I can&#x27;t really see a difference.  I do plan on purchasing more Body Merry products!</li>
    <li> Great product. Definitely saw results in 1 week after using it.</li>
    <li> I can see an improvement already.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price</li>
    <li> The eye cream is quite effective cos I am seeing a difference around my eye area.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!1 I have very dry skin, especially around the eyes, &amp; this has worked wonders for that area, as well as on my neck where I had started to notice a decrease in elasticity. An added benefit is that a little bit goes a long way &amp; unlike many creams I have tried, the dispenser makes it is easy to control the amount I use. I have used this product twice a day for a couple of weeks  and have noticed that the area on the back of my hand to which I dispense the product even looks smoother!&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the product itself, the customer service is outstanding. Fast, friendly service and very efficient follow up from Body Merry. I would recommend to anyone and will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Got this item in a timely fashion.  The company emailed me before I had even received the product giving me directions on how to use the product and other ways to use it.  The email was very informative.  That was helpful because the label on the product was hard to read.  Not impossible to read but difficult because of the design.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell of it and the smell sticks around for awhile.  It&#x27;s hard to say how well it works because I haven&#x27;t been using it long.  I took before pics and will see what kind of changes I see.  I was impressed by the companies email and their desire to please.</li>
    <li> It works well for dark circles, but not a big fan of the smell.</li>
    <li> First, I love how much product this in this container (1 fl. oz.)! Normally, an eye cream will only be offered in tiny containers with very little product. I also like that this one has a pump, although I wish it dispensed a little less product with one pump since you don&#x27;t need much to cover your eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as performance goes, I think this cream is great for moisturizing. I don&#x27;t have terribly dry or oily skin under my eyes, so this product works perfectly to keep my undereyes moisturized, but not too slick.&lt;br /&gt;I do have puffiness and dark circles, especially when I am sleep deprived which I have been the last few days. I don&#x27;t find that the product does much for my circles (I would need a miracle product for that), but I do think that it depuffs my bags a little, so that&#x27;s nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a nice product. Not anything crazy new and innovative, but it gets the job done if the job isn&#x27;t too big. I&#x27;d suggest it to those starting out with eye creams, who don&#x27;t need any miracles quite yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; DISCLAIMER: I WAS SENT THIS PRODUCT FOR REVIEW FROM BODY MERRY THROUGH TOMOSON.COM. ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN.</li>
    <li> Lovely smell.  Bought it because of the good reviews and reasonable price.  Been using it 1-2 times daily for about a month now and have noticed that the skin under my eyes is smoother, lighter and tighter.  My dark circles weren&#x27;t terrible, but I used concealer everyday.  Now I don&#x27;t have to.  Still have some fine lines, but they seem less obvious too.  I&#x27;m 31 years old and don&#x27;t want to look any older than that.  This product seems to do the trick.  Will definitely buy it again.  Have also used &amp;#34;yes to blueberries&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Lancôme revitalist&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;proactive eye serum.  Body merry is by far my favorite.</li>
    <li> Definite smoothness around my eyes since I started using this product.</li>
    <li> I dont have a problem with dark circles, but puffyness. This cream feels so nice, it is not greasy sticky or thick. I like how it blends into your skin nicely, and reduces the puffyness around my eyes.  Sample recieved for review.</li>
    <li> Incredibly soothing and hydrating! I love the scent, it is so refreshing and quickly absorbs into the skin. Best price I have ever seen on such a quality eye cream!!</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from insomnia for many years and always have big dark circles under my eyes.  I have tried so many different products with little to no success. I have used products by Body Merry before, and have been really impressed with the results. This cream is easy to apply and does not leave my skin feeling heavy or oily after I apply it. You get a 1 oz bottle and don&#x27;t need much so it will last for a little while. I have been using it for a few weeks and I apply it in the morning after I get up and before bed. I start at the inside and go outward all the way to my crows feet and make sure I massage it in all the way. I have noticed that the circles are a lot lighter, the puffiness is gone now, and my crows feet are getting lighter. It is packed full of vitamins and really makes my eyes look so much better. This is now a new part of my beauty routine. I received this product as a sample to test and review. This review is solely my opinion. The information provided is what I experienced.</li>
    <li> Initially I reviewed that my eyes burned after I applied this product. However, the company indicated that I might be allergic to it. Others are saying food things. Fair enough.</li>
    <li> I have had dark circles under my eyes most of my adult life.  I really see a difference after using this product!  Also, I am allergic to just about everything, from topical products to meds, but I have not experienced any problems with my eyes itching or burning or swelling.  So far...very good results:)</li>
    <li> I liked this product because it seemed to make my eyes look softer around the edges. I did receive this product free in exchange of me writing a review. Sweetened the deal for me because it was a great product! I liked that the scent was faint and not strong like many other products on the market.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see much change. Meh. That&#x27;s what you get for hoping there is a cream to stop aging. Giving it two stars because I like the tingly feeling on my skin when I put it on.</li>
    <li> Seems to brighten eye area well, however it also dries the eye area a little much.  May be the right product for non sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> Due to my Italian heritage, I have horrible dark circles.  Nothing short of magic could make them disappear.  However, over the last few weeks I have seen some improvement in the color and also the condition of the skin.  I don&#x27;t look quite as tired and the area seems more hydrated (but not puffy).  Also, the small wrinkles I had developed around the eyes are less noticeable.  I apply morning and evening.  Some reviewers complained about the fragrance, but I actually like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 weeks now. I have definitely noticed a reduction in fine lines around my eyes.  it&#x27;s not significant (like the lines aren&#x27;t gone) but I&#x27;m 47 and wouldn&#x27;t expect any product to make them disappear completely.  That said, the skin around my eyes definitely looks healthier.  I also love the texture of this cream; how easily it spreads on the skin.  The pump is very fine (for lack of a better word) so don&#x27;t press down too hard - a light pump allows plenty of cream to be dispensed.  I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many eye creams and undeniably, this eye cream is the best! I couldn&#x27;t live without it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It felt so good the very first time I applied it. As if the skin around my eyes was IMMEDIATELY moisturized and on top of that, it felt comfortable all day. Never felt sticky or pasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a short period of use (not quite 2 weeks) there was definitely a noticeable difference. The skin around my eyes looked more supple and there was a major difference in the texture and overall appearance. My skin absolutely looks younger and my eyes look brighter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it 100%</li>
    <li> Very good product. Im starting to see a difference, although i must say this product requires patience. When used as directed i can say im pleased.</li>
    <li> I really like this cream.  It seems to be working to reduce puffiness and fine lines.  It absorbs quickly.  I especially like the smell...it smells like the ingredients naturally should.</li>
    <li> excellent product great price works great! very happy with it especially around the mouth fine lines in between eyes and forehead!</li>
    <li> So I was going to order this product until I realized..... Most of the reviews for this product appear to be [probably] fake.. Upon looking at the profiles of several of those who gave this a 5 star rating, majority of them have ONLY written a review for this product only (really suspicious)  OR  they write 5 stars on EVERYTHING they have ever ordered, probably meaning that the companies pay them/give things out for free for their 5 star ratings. Just an observation I thought people should be aware of..</li>
    <li> After a month of daily usage (morning and night) I only noticed a reduction in swelling of my eyelids</li>
    <li> Has a nice light minty smell.</li>
    <li> I always have that trouble of panda looking eyes after waking up. I have tried using other eye creams before and none of them seems to work. I tried this one twice a day for more than a week and I can already see the difference. The darkness did not disappear completely but it&#x27;s greatly reduced. I will continue to use this for sure. It smells great too.</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply. Have been using for about 3 weeks and don&#x27;t see much change to the bags under my eyes or all the fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;Will keep trying</li>
    <li> I use this product once or twice a day, and it does seem to take the puffiness out of my lids and under my eyes, which is the reason I&#x27;m trying it.</li>
    <li> first cream to not leave any sort of bad reaction! I have been using this cream for two weeks and so far very happy with this cream!!</li>
    <li> Like it a lot. It has helped tighten my upper and lower eye tissue (I&#x27;m at the farther end of middle age) It sinks in very well, and when I put it on my upper eye region, my powder eye shadow glides on nicely.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is the best eye cream I have ever tried.  Once I even tried Chanel&#x27;s eye cream and that cost over $100.00 and it worked okay but not as good as this product.  And this product cost only about $16.99.  This product really works great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much time for sleep and have genes for dark circles. This cream helped my dark circles up a bit, but not too as much as I liked it would. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months now and I have seem some improvement. I think, however, that the dark circles are still there because of genetics so I can&#x27;t really blame the product for that. The seller also gives great advice in an email! When I asked them questions, they answered within a day. I also use it on my face for wrinkles and that works charmingly. I highly recommend this product and this company.</li>
    <li> Product arrived promptly. Have been using since day one and have seen  improvement. I work nights and don&#x27;t get a lot of sleep and I&#x27;m hoping this product helps with the dark circles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a month or so, and there&#x27;s no difference.</li>
    <li> Live this eye cream. I have really sensitive eyes Before using this product, my under eye was itching and very dry. Now I am happy not itching anymore. Less puffiness and brighter eyes!!! :-) I will definitely buy again at this price!</li>
    <li> i used this and i loved it!!! it smells fruity, but its amazing, definitly buying this agian</li>
    <li> quickly absorbs, light and pleasant scent. i&#x27;ve had dark circles my entire life so i don&#x27;t expect anything to fix that. but the fine lines this seems to help. i&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
    <li> has been very helpful on reducing the discoloration under my eyes. added elasticity and moisture back to the skin. not very heavy on the fragrance (which is a good thing). it is not an instant fix so you do have to use the cream. i dont have wrinkles so not sure how that would help someone who does.</li>
    <li> Very nice on the eyes and I like that it comes in a larger size.</li>
    <li> Really has helped my persistent dark circles and intermittent puffiness.</li>
    <li> Leery of purchasing b/c of all the comments about the smell.  Why would anyone make a face product with a scent? I don&#x27;t like facial products with a scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I only put a star rating because it was required.  PLEASE DO NOT GO BY THE STAR RATING.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product every day, twice daily for about a week and love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Will be excited to see what the changes are long term, but the product has a nice, almost herbal smell, goes on smoothly, and NOT burning. Very pleased so far!</li>
    <li> Very nice eye cream!  I&#x27;ve started using this daily as a replacement for a very expensive one I was previously using.  It works just as well.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see an improvement, but I am loving the consistency and nice cooling effect this cream has. It&#x27;s not too thick, and I love the pump feature, which puts out a perfect amount each time.</li>
    <li> This product feels nice on the skin. It is not heavy or greasy, and it dries well. However, it did nothing for my puffiness or wrinkles. I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I love it and i recomend it.</li>
    <li> I had been using Dermalogica Intensive Eye Repair, but decided to try this product because it received good reviews and was a third of the price of the Dermalogica cream. It works just as well, I&#x27;ll never buy the more expensive cream again. It&#x27;s not Botox, but it is hydrating and seems to help keep my skin smooth and firm. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great for general moisturizing but has really helped diminish the dark circles that appeared &amp; stayed after a serious surgery over the summer.  Plus, great customer service -- the company CEO personally reached out via email to make sure I was happy with the product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I bought this along with the Body Merry Super 6 Serum, the Serum I love and has already made visible improvements. I think the Eye Cream needs a lot more time to work. Then again the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes are the worst area on my face. I didn&#x27;t even realize how bad they actually were until I&#x27;d been putting on this cream for 2 weeks and realized I hadn&#x27;t really seen any change. BUT Body Merry Super 6 Serum to the rescue. I started putting the serum directly under my eyes, I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s not the intended use because it does brun a little when I put it there (but like I said, my under eye area is bad and no pain, no gain), and then I layer the eye cream on top of the serum. I feel like that combination is producing results so I&#x27;m going to stick with it. On the bright side with this cream, I have a nickel sensitivity on my ears from wearing cheap earrings, it creates a lot of dry skin around my ear piercing hole. I accidentally rubbed some of this cream on my ear before bed one night and my ear looked great the next day. So I know there are definitely ingredients in the cream that work, my eyes just need a little more than this cream can give right now.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I&#x27;ve been using it for approximately two weeks, it has a cool refreshing feel to it and is very light weight so I can wear it under my make up as well as at night.  Also has a light scent, not overwhelming.  I will definitely be reordering in the future.</li>
    <li> This Eye Cream has done wonders for me.  I am trying to use more natural products, but I still want to see results.  If I went out and purchased all of the ingredients in this amazing cream, it would cost a fortune!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump on this bottle is great.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with clogging in the 3 months that I have had it.  A small pressure on the pump is all you really need since only a small amount of product is needed (actually, only a TINY amount is needed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye cream itself has reduced puffiness around my eyes, eliminated dark circles, and pretty much has eliminated my crows feet.  I will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I had an allergic reaction, around my eyes were swollen/puffy when I woke up.  Refund please.</li>
    <li> This product really works for me.  I have tried many, many eye creams for puffiness etc., including Chamonix  (which I returned). Body Merry eye cream is soothing, gets rid of puffiness.  I use the cream at night and in the morning before I put make-up on.  I highly recommend Body Merry eye cream.</li>
    <li> This product is good also. I&#x27;m using it for puffy eyes which the eye cream has helped.</li>
    <li> *Product provided for review*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this eye cream over 1 month and had a good experience. The ingredients helped target my dark under eye circles. While it did not work on severe wrinkles, it did keep my eye area moisturized throughout the day. Since I have a darker skin tone, it took me a few days to see results. With consistent use, this cream can help with the appearance of eye issues like bags, etc. but not eliminate severe marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally prefer the dark packaging but that has no bearing on the cream&#x27;s efficacy. The eye cream comes in a small portable container and will be travel-friendly.</li>
    <li> This was a nice cream. It was irritating to my eyes, but they are very sensitive to begin with.</li>
    <li> Smells great and isn&#x27;t greasy, but after 6 months of using it twice a day (I purchased two bottles and not yet finished with second one). I haven&#x27;t seen a noticeable difference. I am guessing this would work better on those with puffy under eyes, not the sunken dark circle type like I have.</li>
    <li> Love the cream!  Seems to do what it says. I didn&#x27;t have dark circles but just looked tired. Not anymore.  Always get looks of disbelief that I am a Grandma so there is that!</li>
    <li> This cream does not work. NO difference since using it twice a day.....BIG waste of money.</li>
    <li> I really like this product! Light weight, not greasy at all. I don&#x27;t have dark circles, so I don&#x27;t know if it works for those, but I love the way this moisturizes my lids. Makeup goes on smoothly also.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product and love what I&#x27;ve seen in a matter of weeks.  It&#x27;s helped so much with the wrinkles and dark circles around my eyes.  This will be my product of choice going forward!</li>
    <li> Awesome cream. I love LoVe the smell .&lt;br /&gt;Then when you put it on you can feel the moisture in the right areas. I put it in my whole face and it makes my face feel good and relaxed. I have replaced it from my proactive cream. It&#x27;s a nice cream. I&#x27;m barely 30 so not sure how much it has saved me in my wrinkles but the feeling and the smell is great!</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous under eye creams that didn&#x27;t work.  None of them has come up to Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream.  I have many crows feet around my eyes and bags under my eyes.  I could see a noticeable difference within a week of starting to use Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream!  It actually tingles upon application.  Almost like you can feel it working!  I have recently started using it on my whole face! I LOVE it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love its smell. It seems pretty good until now. It absorbs quickly and seems to improve the appearance of skin around my eyes...</li>
    <li> It works.&lt;br /&gt;My eyes look much longer.</li>
    <li> So far I am really liking this product. It feels very refreshing when you put it on. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s made much if a difference but I will continue to use it because most products take longer than 2 weeks to see results. Nice scent also.</li>
    <li> I have only been using 2 weeks, but notice a difference in the dark circles under my eyes. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely amazing stuff! I started with being very impressed that within a couple of weeks I noticed the puffiness was lessened and although I wasn&#x27;t getting more sleep than usual, the dark areas lightened. I started using it on my forehead and around my mouth where wrinkles are getting annoying as well. I was surprised when I traveled to visit family and they were complimenting me on my nice skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: as with all wrinkle areas, I use facial vibrators to ensure that moisturizers absorb. I&#x27;ve done this for many years, so that isn&#x27;t what was having the effect. The only thing that has changed for me in years is this eye cream. I plan to try other products but am trying to be thrifty by waiting until the other runs out.</li>
    <li> This product works very well and far exceeds some of the products I have previously used.</li>
    <li> First off delivery was quick and we&#x27;ll packaged! The product itself is gentle and does not irritate the eyes. It was refreshing!</li>
    <li> After just one use I saw a difference love ittt!!! It honestly left my skin around my eyes feeling firm and it made me feel wonderful even my husband commented on how good my eyes looked I will be using this every day no dout about it!</li>
    <li> I have noticed over time using this product, my fine lines are slowly fading. Thats awesome. I am happy that it keeps my face, especially the eye area looking younger. I got this product free to review. I love it.</li>
    <li> So light!  Its doesn&#x27;t migrate into my eyes at night.</li>
    <li> I like it. Very good.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. It ACTUALLY WORKS. Does what it says it will do. Less dark circles, less fine lines, doesn&#x27;t burn, and love that it&#x27;s all natural great ingredients. Much better than super expensive eye creams out there!! Thanks for an awesome product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice cream.  Very light and not greasy.  I like the smell too.  Kind of herbal.  I can&#x27;t really say my &amp;#34;fine lines&amp;#34; are reducing, but they always look better after I put some sort of eye cream on them.  I gave it 4 stores rather than 5 as my lines are not magically disappearing, but I guess I didn&#x27;t really expect anything miraculous in that regard.</li>
    <li> I like how this cream smooths out the lines under my eyes. I like how this smells. Very moisturizing. I did get this to review</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an esthetician for 12 years..after trying many, many eye creams and products..I highly recommend this one. It contains most ingredients you need in an product, feels and smells good.</li>
    <li> Have only used product for a short time; but, I&#x27;m genuinely impressed with it, with the Seller, and with the obvious commitment to customer satisfaction. Exceeding even my highest expectations!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell. But it&#x27;s work a little bit for my eye circle.</li>
    <li> Works great. smooth my eye area.</li>
    <li> This is a great smelling non greasy lotion that has worked WONDERS on the lines on my bottom eyelids.</li>
    <li> I like it but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that different from the other eye creams I&#x27;ve used. Maybe I need to give it more time.</li>
    <li> Nice eye cream.  Not the magic bullet for crow&#x27;s feet I was hoping it would be but I it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
    <li> This is an AMAZING product that I got at  at great rate to try! I honestly am extremely impressed at my results. First I have to say the packing was very professional. I like the smell of this product, it is citrusy and nice. Now, I always have bags under my eyes and I was hoping for at least a small improvement.  After a few hours I seen some improvement, but after 24 hours It looked as if I had NEW EYES! I have attached a before and after picture. I am so happy with the turnout and I am going to continue to be a loyal customer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three weeks and have seen a noticeable improvement! Thank you Body Merry!</li>
    <li> Eye cream  is soft on the skin feels good</li>
    <li> This cream feels good and the heaviness below my eyes seem less apparent.  Love it!</li>
    <li> No miracles happening, but I like the feel of this cream and the subtle changes I see.</li>
    <li> I tried it for the first time last night. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say if it works or not  because stress is a component always present in my life. Anyway, the customer support is very kind and they follow up the customer after purchase.&lt;br /&gt;products are natural, and it doesn&#x27;t leave the skin very oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is not a prohibitive cost, and creams are all the same (they don&#x27;t change your biology).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest to give it a try.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase!  Went out on a limb to try it and I could not be more pleased!  I use this with the Eye Serum at night before I go to bed and then in the morning and just love the results it has given me after 6 weeks.  My skin and eyes prior to using the eye cream were dry and unhealthy looking.  Really made me look older than I was.  Now after six weeks my skin is heather and some of the lines in and around my eyes are getting smoother.  Well, I am sold and  am here to testify this product is for real.  If you do decide to buy, give it 5-6 weeks and use it as per instructions.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free and I have been using it for a little over a week.  I&#x27;m noticing differences around my eyes.  I usually suffer from puffiness under my eyes and see a significant difference which I LOVE! I will continue to use it and before I run out will pick up some more as my constant puffiness is going away YEAY! :)</li>
    <li> this product is so nice! A little goes a long way, which is so different then other products I have used in the past. Shipping was so fast and I can already start to see a difference in just 2 days! I would definitely  recommend to anyone! Can&#x27;t wait to see what I look like in a week! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this cream! Within a week of using it, I&#x27;ve noticed less dark circles under my eyes and less wrinkles all around the eye area.</li>
    <li> I love to try various creams, serums, and oils so when I was given the chance to purchase this eye cream at a special price to test for quality, I was elated.  I have also noticed dark circles under my eyes as I am in grad school and the late study nights are getting to me and my eyes are showing the effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I like this product for several reasons.  First of all, it is dispensed using a pump system.  I prefer that over a jar with a lid.  It comes out white (see picture) but is readily absorbed by my skin.  After the first use, you can already feel the skin tightening around your eyes.  It does not leave your skin greasy or oil but leaves it soft.  I have used it twice a day for three days and have already noticed a lightening of my dark circles.  Even my 13 year old daughter commented that I looked &amp;#34;rested&amp;#34;.  lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that stops me from rating 5 stars is the scent.  While it is not unpleasant, I prefer unscented products.</li>
    <li> love the smooth texture of the cream. i noticed a slight improvement on my dark circles. still looking for another eye cream that would work on my dark circles and lines.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a solution, This is it. Best cream I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!  Will order again!!</li>
    <li> So far, I have used this product twice a day for 4 weeks in combination with OZ Naturals Eye Gel. I have seen absolutely no difference in my dark circles and tired looking eyes.</li>
    <li> Great product.Love the way my skin feels.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Eye cream,very smoothing around the eyes. I sometimes put it all over my face, since its such a generous amount</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Hard to find good natural products. Smells great and works great.</li>
    <li> This product is ok.  It&#x27;s overly scented which gave me a headache the first week.  At most, it is a nice moisturizer which absorbs quickly.  I have seen no improvements in my skin after using it for a couple of months.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is really amazing, I&#x27;ve only had it a few days and it is working great. Thank you so much for a great product.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is truly a wonder.  I have been pretty fortunate to have pretty decent skin all my life but in the last few years, I have noticed drier skin around my eyes and bags and darker tones due to sleep deprivation and a recent lazy skincare regime.  I bought this after reading all the good reviews and truly, the reviewers did not steer me wrong!  This stuff truly de-puffs, tightens and seems to blend the dark shadows under the eyes!  Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I never had crazy bags to begin so can I cannot attest to its effectiveness with more serious bags.  One thing I&#x27;ll point out is that for the past few months, I had really neglected my skin and my basic cleanse, tone, serum, moisturize regime due to crazy work schedules, etc.  I found this moisturizer the other day amid my pile of beauty potions and used it.  Immediately, I noticed a difference to my tired, sallow skin.  I am not getting paid to endorse this product in any way either. A few days into my reintroduction to the eye cream, I swear I will never stop using it.  It really helps and I think moisturizing will help the prevention of eye wrinkles.  The natural ingredients give me no pause to slather it on around my eyes and the pump is a nice design.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the nice cool feeling when she put this on. She has only been using it for a few days, but says it goes on smooth without any irritation.</li>
    <li> works good only applied a little and it worked great!</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream it is amazing! It smells so good and has already done wonders to the circles around my eyes!</li>
    <li> Wow Thanks it really works great</li>
    <li> I have just finished with this product and it does not do anything at all. It&#x27;s a glorified eye cream and not even a great one at that. Would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Product doesn&#x27;t work have been using for a month and see no change.</li>
    <li> I like the way this product feels but it&#x27;s still to early to see if the darkness under my eyes has lightened. So I cannot give the right amount of stars as of yet.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Excelent service.</li>
    <li> Very effective in removing the dark circles under my eyes. I no longer look like a walking Panda and my eyes are a lot brighter now.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh, I love this stuff! I received this eye cream free for review purposes. A little bit will go a LONG way with this cream.  One pump was more then enough to do around my eyes and forehead wrinkles.  I have very sensitive skin and I had no problems with this eye cream at all, no redness or itching.  There is a slight smell to this cream that does tend to hang on, but to me it smells somewhat like what we used in the 80&#x27;s to wash our faces with in the blue jar, which to me is a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; smell.  With the first use I couldn&#x27;t believe it, it plumped my skin up enough on my eyelids to actually make the wrinkles appear as though they had diminished a little, almost right away!  I am sold on this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. :(</li>
    <li> Very hydrating. Perfect texture...not to greasy...not to dry.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is so silky and smooth!! It glides on so well and is absorbed by the skin quickly. I love a gentle herbal smell. It reminds me of Aveda products. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and I have already noticed the difference. The skin under my eyes is smoother and brighter. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I swear my eyes are already less tired looking.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any difference in my skin as of yet, but I wanted  to get the retinal moisturizer.  Maybe next time!</li>
    <li> No sign a any improvement on my wrinkles or dark circles after a week&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I really like this eye cream.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. I didn&#x27;t expect to see such fast results, but there was a noticeable difference in 24 hours. I am in my 60&#x27;s but my skin looks very good due in large part to my oily skin that I struggled with in my youth, but recently the hatch lines under my eyes had gone rapidly from barely noticeable to quite pronounced and remained that way the last three or four months. In just two applications the lines were nearly gone and now, after almost a month, you&#x27;d hardly guess they were ever there. Remarkable. I certainly didn&#x27;t expect it to be this good, especially at this price. I will definitely keep buying this eye cream for my daily skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> Works great on my dark circles.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks. I have not seen any drastic changes although I will continue to use it and do recommend it. I&#x27;ve seen very minimal results for crows feet.</li>
    <li> makes my eyes look better, more rested... really like this one!</li>
    <li> Very soft and feels great on my eyes. Nice light smell and not too heavy.</li>
    <li> Nice and smooth, easily absorbed,  reduces apearance of wrinkles</li>
    <li> I get lots of puffiness around my eyes from allergies. I have tried many products in a variety of price ranges and this one is the best I have used.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It reminds me of some high end eye creams with the way it&#x27;s fragranced. I have used it since I got it and so far so good ! I&#x27;m anxious to see if my skin keeps on improving!</li>
    <li> Wow... i was sceptical cos of the numerous suspicious reviews.... Now i know for a fact this works... i work night shift and i have bags below my eye lid... within a week my fiancee told me its almost gone... Thank you...&lt;br /&gt;And just to let u all know, all you need is a small amount of application and it will last along time.... Good luck everyone!!!</li>
    <li> No complaints so far. It takes time for this to work.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this is all natural. It goes on smooth, helps with the crows feet and dark circles.</li>
    <li> This eye cream works as well as an eye serum that I paid $90 for in the past. It lifts, clears dark circles and plumps up fine lines, fast. The consistency is of a thin lotion. I use this in the morning and a thicker cream at night. I love the all natural ingredients and the company&#x27;s follow up email. Great customer service makes a difference. If I could take off 1/2 a star for packaging I would. However, more high end packaging would undoubtedly mean a higher price, which a luxury product junkie like myself would be willing to pay. I just am not willing to pay 5 times the money for the fancy packaging. So, for now I&#x27;m sticking to Body Merry&#x27;s Eye Cream. However, I do feel the packaging should be improved to even remotely reflect the highly effective, luxurious product inside.</li>
    <li> I like the product and the item was shipped quickly.  Pleasant experience.</li>
    <li> Wonderful eye cream. I even use it on my smile lines and my forehead.  My skin has become softer using it.</li>
    <li> The cream is light, smells great and goes on smoothly and easily. It really seems to work for my dark circles - the only cream so far which can do it! Also, my &amp;#34;crow&#x27;s feet&amp;#34; in the outer corners of my eyes are less visible. The cream could be slightly heavier, but I figured it out; for night use I just add a greasier cream after several minutes and, both together, they work miracles! I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 72 going on 73, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting any great change under my eyes, but I like this cream because it doesn&#x27;t get all greasy, and soaks in quite nicely. I could do without the scent, but so far it hasn&#x27;t made me wheeze which is the sighn I get when any scent is to strong.  So I will probably order this again.</li>
    <li> The product stings a bit.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream.  Totally awesome!  I highly recommend it to anyone!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have had dark circles my entire life, they become much worse when I don&#x27;t get enough sleep,  This cream seems to be working pretty well so far. I Wake up looking refreshed and my dark circles seem to be fading. Delivery was fast.  I recommend it</li>
    <li> Not really regarding this product, but in general, all products on the amazon website.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend you reading the reviews of any products carefully,especially those 5 stars ones.For instance you can check any random reviewer of 5 stars,and see how many other superlative reviews does she or he has...It is a big scam unfortunately. Its impossible a random person has bought 40 or more amazing products with all 5 stars reviews. Just be careful when buying a new product.</li>
    <li> Awesome love the product</li>
    <li> It is great and work on my eyes, I will definitely recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week now, and I don&#x27;t have any complaints!!! I put this under my eyes before I put on makeup, but if you decide to do that, your going to have to give it time to dry before applying.</li>
    <li> I was a sufferer from dark circles and was so embarrassed by my appearance, but after using this my circles have lightened enough to cover and hopefully it continues.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I like the way it feels.  Goes on light.  The scent is a little heavy but dissipates quickly.  Overall, a product I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much at the price, but this works very well. After two weeks of using it twice a day, there&#x27;s a noticeable difference on those frustrating crow&#x27;s feet lines.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is horrible. It made me break out around my eyes and turned the skin around my eyes red. Please don&#x27;t purchase it.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Makes my eyes look rested and bright at all times!</li>
    <li> i really wanted this because of the fine lines under my eyes, and i havent seen any improvement for that but it does bring some sort of glow to my skin and makes my eyes brighter</li>
    <li> This works really well</li>
    <li> The eye cream is easy to use and feels great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not much of a believer in creams really but like many, I use them anyway in the hope that I&#x27;ll look 10 years younger tomorrow. But I think this cream really does improve the eye area. It is quite thin and absorbed really easily and works for me - I would recommend giving it a go!</li>
    <li> This eye cream leaves my eye area very soft and moisturized, but not greasy.  Goes very well under make up, doesn&#x27;t make your eye make up slide around at all.  Shake before first use though, since mine separated.  When I first pumped it out, only clear liquid came out (and I didn&#x27;t know that wasn&#x27;t supposed to happen).  It took the third time using for me to see the cream.</li>
    <li> I only started using this product a few days. I do have puffy eyes due to a hormonal imbalance so I&#x27;m not sure if this will actually help with that problem.  But so far I have noticed that the eye area seems a bit brighter. I gave it a four star because it&#x27;s a bit too early to determine the effectiveness of the cream. I like that the price was great and that it can go a long way. The cream goes on easily and it&#x27;s not greasy at all.  I will post a follow up feedback after using it for a while longer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 25 days and have noticed some difference. First I am 53 so the skin around my eyes is thinning and my eyelids are a bit droopy and you could see the fine lines and wrinkles... At first I was putting it on a night only and really didn&#x27;t notice any difference but when I started putting it on before applying my makeup I loved how smooth my skin felt and noticed more of a difference. You just need such a small amount and it&#x27;s a really nice cream. Nice smell and very light. I also started using it on my upper lip where I have those kiss wrinkles and have noticed they plump out a bit. So I have been using it there everyday too. It&#x27;s a decent product. But on the other side of it... It&#x27;s not a miracle cream. My eyes do not have the look or feel of a 25 year old.. They still are the eyes of a 53 year old woman this cream just gave them a little more oomph. I honestly do not believe there is a cream out there that will actually remove wrinkles completely. It can smooth out a bit but nothing significant and no comment were made about how refreshed I look. I don&#x27;t feel that a &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; is going to change things back but may help if I continue for the future... So long term would be the true test. So I give this 3 stars because I did not get the significant change people talked of. Very subtle and I had to look for it. I am going to give it another month.... I will update.</li>
    <li> So Far So Good Seems to be Helping My lines around eyes and puffiness.I will continue to use this product and the company has been very supportive and helpful It is very nice that a company checks up and gives support</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Arbonne and Peter Thomas Roth (PTR) skincare products for many years and had been satisfied with PTR&#x27;s &amp;quot;Intensive Anti-Aging Cellular Eye Cream.&amp;quot;  Then I developed dark undereye circles for some reason several months ago.  I switched to one of PTR&#x27;s specialized eye creams (Power K Rescue) for dark circles with no success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I read the positive reviews of this eye cream by Body Merry.  I was a little doubtful because I&#x27;m totally unfamiliar with this skincare line and (dare I say it?) sometimes I feel like some companies have a bunch of fake positive reviews added in.  But since the current Amazon price was only $16.99, I figured it wasn&#x27;t an extremely expensive purchase if I didn&#x27;t end up liking it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first glance, I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed.  Although it functions perfectly well, the plastic pump container doesn&#x27;t have the same high-end professional appearance that the other eye creams I&#x27;ve used have.  And, once I had pumped a little dollop out to smooth around my eyes, the consistency of the cream felt too wet and lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it works!  (Or at least for me, it does.)  This too-wet-feeling eye cream doesn&#x27;t stay wet but rather seems to absorb well.  And, now after a month of use, my recently-developed dark circles are practically gone.  Plus the skin around my eyes looks great now -- smoother and tighter -- and has recovered from my unsuccessful use of the PTR Power K Rescue eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that could have been an issue for me is the scent.  I usually prefer unscented skincare products.  But this actually smells so nice that I&#x27;m perfectly happy with the smell (reminds me of the light herbal smell in spas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note of caution:  the pump dispenser wants to give you a bit more than you need for both eyes.  I found it works fine and gives you an appropriate amount, though, if you just slightly depress it rather than fully pressing down.ion with this eye cream, I may give something else a try.</li>
    <li> This did absolutely nothing for my dark circles or fine lines. Its just a normal cream. I am very disappointed with the results. When i read all this good reviews, i was excited and really hoping to see a difference even a little bit. I used this religiously and there was zero change. I am not buying this ever and i highly recommend others not to purchase this. Do not believe in all this great reviews.</li>
    <li> Where do I begin! First let me say I have very sensitive skin and eyes! Everything irritates my eyes, mascara, creams and make up. But at 47 the lines and puffiness crept in! Loved the ingredients and ordered. I use am and pm. I use it under, around/above and on upper lid!&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic product! Product goes a long way! And the price is amazingly low for results you see!&lt;br /&gt;Order! Nothing to loose but puffiness and lines!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Meg</li>
    <li> eye cream did not work like i expected</li>
    <li> 1. What is your main concern why you tried this product?&lt;br /&gt;I have had dark circles under my eyes for as long as I can remember.  I am thankful in receiving a complimentary free product courtesy of Body Merry.&lt;br /&gt;2. What do you expect to achieve in using the product?&lt;br /&gt;Softer skin &amp; lightening of the skin around my eyes&lt;br /&gt;3. Will you recommend it to other and if so who?&lt;br /&gt;Yes.  I would recommend to anyone who likes to feel fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cooling sensation comes immediately after applying this product.  It smells great, and it doesn&#x27;t require a large amount to make your entire face fresh and clean.  The circles that were around my eyes have practically disappeared after only a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewer&#x27;s Name: Joshua Adam Haltom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update as of February 13, 2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We let one of our friends who is also our client to experience this product, and her response was:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Its a good product, my face is looking better and smoother&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> great product! great results!&lt;br /&gt;i bought 3 of their products and I love each and every one!</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for almost a week now and I am so glad I bought it.  It goes on so smoothly and I feel that it penetrates really well.  It also goes well with my eye concealer in the mornings when putting on my makeup.  It doesn&#x27;t ball up like some other eye creams do.  I am looking forward to using this eye cream for a long time.</li>
    <li> Just started using this. I&#x27;m 59 and many products irritate my eye area. This one absorbs rapidly and feels good. I recommend this cream for those that struggle with creams that leave a residue or oily feeling. I use this day and night and under make up.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I have also been using this on my forehead (haha)...trying to tackle those wrinkles too</li>
    <li> DON&#x27; LIKE IT AT ALL DID NOTHING FOR MY EYES, VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> Truth be told this is an excellent product. The only reason why I am not giving this five stars is because, I specifically purchased this with the hope of lightening the darkness around my eyes. It has helped somewhat, but mostly, it has made the area around my eyes more smooth. Not only in appearance but in touch as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great at removing wrinkles but just okay at lightening up dark circles underneath eyes.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product and should be part of your daily routine.</li>
    <li> Lovely fragrance and very gentle on the skin</li>
    <li> I love how refreshed I look after using this! My dark circles and puffiness aren&#x27;t noticeable!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little under three weeks and I have to say I can see a large difference. I started drinking between 3 and 4 liters of water a day about 3 months ago. That alone has made a great improvement to my skin. However, now that I have added this cream  I can see my face has tightened, my bags under my eyes are nearly gone, and I look younger (I am 30.) I am also lazy so I use this cream all over my face instead of just under my eyes. I highly recommend this cream. Also, I noticed that a lot of people have commented on the smell. I have an extremely strong sense of smell, and this seems to just have a faint tea tree oil smell that is not strong at all. I use a lot of natural products so the smell is fine to me and very faint.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and although it smells nice and a little goes a long way, I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference or an effect, positive or negative.</li>
    <li> This was the only eye cream that removed the dark circles under my eyes. I don&#x27;t know why the others didn&#x27;t work but this one worked at last. It took a while but during that span of time I was able to see how my dark circles brighten. Very effective.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and as promised. I have been using it twice daily for a few weeks now. It is light but rich and smells nice. I believe it does a good job with fine lines and wrinkles but isn&#x27;t effective at helping with dark circles. I have tried so many products to help with this problem and have yet to find one that works.</li>
    <li> Ok product- dark circles haven&#x27;t diminished and it doesn&#x27;t seem to do muh other than moisturize.</li>
    <li> My dark circles are almost gone. I love this product.</li>
    <li> This product is packed with good stuff. Prefect eye Cream. made a big difference in my dark circles!</li>
    <li> Really enjoying this product! I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see any difference in my dark circles, but it&#x27;s very moisterizing, non-greasy, feels very luxurious going on. Bonus points for needing very little, so the bottle should last a long time. My only gripe is with the dispenser. One full pump is enough for probably 6 eyes. So word to the wise, tap very gently on the pump to get the amount you need.</li>
    <li> It is good and practical.</li>
    <li> I have not seen a difference. I will finish using the product.</li>
    <li> Eye cream arrived quickly and it is every bit as good as what I reviewed. Great product at an amazing price!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;m writing a review about any product. I&#x27;d keep it short and sweet. I have used A LOT of eye creams and I mean A LOT. From drug store brands to the high end brands. My problem was dark circles/bags and wrinkles underneath my eyes ( I have had them since I was 15/16 I guess ) So, it was obvious to me that I can&#x27;t get rid of those but I just wanted something that would help me with dark circles and under eye bags and also with those difficult to deal with lines. And I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I write that out of everything that I have ever used, this hands down is the best eye cream ever. Not to oily or greasy, absorbs quickly and the best part is I can see visible difference under my eye in the morning. LOVE this product and will definitely be repurchasing once I run out.</li>
    <li> ...so its really too soon to rate the performance of the cream, but I do have a comment for the seller.  I have to assume that people who are buying Age Defying eye cream are most likely people who are (like me) OLDER and are experiencing some of the normal decline in vision.  ..and yet, I would challenge any person to try and read the directions either on the bottle or on the box without using at least a 10X magnifier.&lt;br /&gt;I use other Body Merry products and have been delighted with them.  I have no doubt I will like this one just as well....but really, can they add a paper insert that is human readable .  Lucky for me, I used common sense and just applied a small amount around my eyes.  I can&#x27;t imagine there would be other instructions.....but if there are, I will never know.</li>
    <li> GREAT product! No problems, working great so far!</li>
    <li> great product! Can tell a difference all ready!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered this cream. I have an issue with under eye puffiness and bags due to my allergies.This is one of the first creams that I can say actually helps with that.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve all been sold on &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; products before and been disappointed.  I have natural dark circles under my eyes, and have never really thought anything could help much except makeup.  Gave this a try, and over 3 months of regular use the results are noticeable enough that a friend commented on how great I looked last night. This is no miracle, just a solid, effective product that delivers as promised.  You won&#x27;t get results overnight, so not good for a &amp;#34;pick me up&amp;#34; after a night in Vegas, but if you add it to your normal regimen I think you&#x27;ll be really happy.</li>
    <li> I actually use it. Meaning- I bought it because of the reviews, tried it, liked it so much I&#x27;m on my second bottle. I wear contacts, so my eyes are already a sensitive area. This eye cream is soothing, feels lightweight, smells good.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use nightly in preparation for my wedding in August. After using for only two weeks, I feel and see a difference around my eyes! I didn&#x27;t have particularly dark under-eye circles or heavy wrinkles, but the area is definitely softer and more youthful looking. Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great value for what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this eye cream. I&#x27;ve noticed a substantial difference under my eyes. My dark circles are way less noticeable and the puffiness has reduced. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Great  eye cream.  I just use one squirt&amp; it moisturizes my whole face!</li>
    <li> Just used this product last night and I am not happy with the smell. The strong scent reminds me of shaving cream and Im not pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for great eye creams or serums through Amazon for quite awhile. I had stumbled upon &#x27;Amara Organics,&#x27; and actually loved it. When it was gone, I decided, what the hell, lets see what else there is. So I purchased this one. From the first moment, I knew it was not as good. The lotion is much thicker and you really have to rub it in, it&#x27;s heavier. Also, what I loved about Amara is you can feel it pulling on your skin. It&#x27;s light and it actually feels like it&#x27;s working. So I&#x27;m left with this larger bottle of this eye cream and kind of looking forward to getting through it so I can go back to Amara. The smell isn&#x27;t bad though, and it&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s a 3, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m seeing some minor results; I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and have seen less puffiness under eye bags and some of the dark circles have faded slightly.  Hoping to see more improvement with longer time usage?</li>
    <li> It is close to a month since I deploy this product to try reducing my big eye bags and it seems that the eye cream has improved the condition slightly.  Even though my eye bags are still obvious, but they are not as big as before, so I think giving the eye cream another 3 months to see the results.</li>
    <li> I love the product! It&#x27;s very rich and hydrates the eye area without being greasy. Works well at night and under my eye make up during the day. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> this eye cream is great&lt;br /&gt;the dispensing bottle is wonderful --easily control amount you want&lt;br /&gt;very creamy&lt;br /&gt;absorbs quickly</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for 2 weeks now.  I have noticed a big difference in the dark circles under my eyes.  It&#x27;s great to find a product that has natural products and essential oils.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This really works on the whole eye skin area, even eyelids! Not sticky and I can use it under eyeshadow. My sensitive skin has no problem with this. I already bought another one so I won&#x27;t run out. I&#x27;m 45😉</li>
    <li> Got this for $1, thanks!</li>
    <li> I purchased &amp; received this cream a week ago, I took a before picture of my horrible dark circles so that I can come back on here and post an after picture when I start to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 3 stars because I am very hopeful that this cream will help, because of all the great reviews. I haven&#x27;t noticed anything significant yet, but as I said I&#x27;ll be back with my full review hopefully soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con so far is the smell.. It&#x27;s terrible! Smells like a bad cologne a 90 year old man would wear. The smell does go away after a while but..ugh, awful.</li>
    <li> my dark circles are dissapearing and all sorts of wrinkle too. Voila..</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now and I do see a difference. Delivery was fast and communication with seller was excellent.</li>
    <li> Seems to work on my dark circles under my eyes! The pumps squeeze too much out sometimes would prefer different different packaging so that product doesn&#x27;t goes to waste!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It goes on smooth, not greasy and I saw instant results. I&#x27;ve tried so many creams and this by far is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;I also use this on my neck in the morning and night.</li>
    <li> No distinct change noticed yet. Will continue using it for several weeks.</li>
    <li> Save your money. Nothing gets rid of dark circles except surgery or bleaching. I wish companies would just be honest and call it &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Works for real. I&#x27;ve tried other  eye creams before but it didn&#x27;t do anything to at least brighten the dark circles under my eyes. This one proved to be really effective and the results are here to stay. No more dark circles under my eye after putting it on every night.</li>
    <li> Tis is a wonderful product.  I am so glad I bought it.  It gets rid of dark circles, my wrinkles have diminished!  Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any results after two weeks of use.</li>
    <li> One word - works! You will notice the difference!</li>
    <li> I am skeptical about eye creams and bought this one to try only because a friend of mine using it and I saw results for myself.  I have been using it only for a few weeks and already see firmer skin and fewer lines. It is very light  and not greasy, quickly absorbed by skin, does not have heavy smell and most attractive part - it&#x27;s price.  I would definitely recommend to try it out</li>
    <li> The first time I applied this, my undereye skin looked MORE wrinkly than ever before! I was startled! Then I paid closer attention to patting it gently from my outer eye corners towards my inner eye corners, and I could see that it helps. It is sort of alarming to feel like I&#x27;m mushing my undereye skin into a less-wrinkly position, but whatever works. I&#x27;m 35 and starting to really see changes under my eyes! Not accepting it gracefully--fighting it as hard as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light, but lime, which is a weird scent for an undereye cream in my opinion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it for a week, but if I get big changes, I will edit to update.</li>
    <li> Works very well. I will continue to use daily.</li>
    <li> This eye cream feels good going on but honestly I didn&#x27;t see a difference in my dark circles.But I will keep on using it but I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I am very surprisec at the quality of the product for the price. I am using the eye cream am and pm. I use my derma wand. I like the way my concealer wears. This eye cream is not greasy.</li>
    <li> I used this as a full face and neck moisturizer, but as far as an eye cream, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my dark circles.</li>
    <li> it is very good but give me itchy and tears in my eyes i think because it has herb smell , there for i try to used it a night before bed time and i am oky next day</li>
    <li> I have noticed a difference yet</li>
    <li> Another great product. I am pleased. It did what it said it would.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough how much I love this. I have been using this for three days and already see a difference. Don&#x27;t believe me? Neither would I. I swear, I am not with the company, although I would happily be their spokesperson for free! I am over 40 and have fair to medium skin, and the skin under my eyes, while not being dark circles per se, looked shiny, bluish, and bumpy. After three days the blue tint has diminished by about %20 and the bumps seem less. This after 3 days!!!!!! I had read the other reviews here with skepticism, but the Body Merry line has gotten great reviews on many sites I visited, so I decided to give it a try. I have been very impressed by the Body Merry products, and I think the pricing is incredible compared to it other high quality options. It is really worth your time to give this a shot</li>
    <li> I like the product. It keeps the eye area smoother and moist.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a review writer usually but I had to on this one. First off as a mom of three, lack of sleep, stress, age etc., had started to take it&#x27;s toll on my eyes. I was done with dark circles, lines, tired eyes. I&#x27;ve tried other products, no luck. This one I tried by chance and wow I&#x27;m never trying anything else. It works! It does not irritate my eyes and in just over a week I got results. I highly recommend trying it. It&#x27;s affordable and works. Awesome product!!</li>
    <li> This cream works a little bit to erase the darkness and puffyness under my eyes. I&#x27;ve used it consistently. I might work better for someone who has less raccoon eyes than I do. Lol thank you though for this freebie.I&#x27;m always trying new products.</li>
    <li> Works great! Doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like some creams do and just a little will do. I can see the dark circles lightening already.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and so far he loves it! It has definitely helped with his dark circles.</li>
    <li> really great product.  Seems very natural, but visibly really works.  Love love love it.  smells great too.</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff I have found that works. Awesome seller.</li>
    <li> Great eye cream!!!!!  Just ordered another one....great consistency and has a nice fresh scent!!!)))))))</li>
    <li> I very much enjoy this eye cream- it goes on smooth and absorbs well. The ingredients are top notch and I am noticing softer lines after just a couple weeks!</li>
    <li> For the price, this product is great. The smell does take a little getting used to, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming and after using for a while, you don&#x27;t even notice it. The cream goes on smooth, absorbs well and seems to plump up the area under my eyes, minimizing fine lines and dark circles. I apply it twice a day - in the morning underneath my makeup and at night before bed.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fabulous! I used Body Merry&#x27;s Neck Cream and liked it, so thought I&#x27;d give their Eye Cream a try. Even though I&#x27;m 60+, and had just about given up on finding anything that would help with my creased lids and puffy under-eye area, I decided to try this product. While it can&#x27;t erase the years, it does make my eye area look younger and firmer. And it&#x27;s much less expensive than some other eye treatments that don&#x27;t work. I highly recommend Body Merry&#x27;s Eye Cream!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks consistently morning and night and have not seen any results yet, my review is neutral because of this reason. It may be too early to review. I will continue to use it though as there are no real negatives either!</li>
    <li> Have only used 1 week and I can see a difference in the puffiness under my eyes already, and it is also smoothing my wrinkles and fading some dark patches on my face.</li>
    <li> Lightens my eye bags and reduced the few wrinkles around my eyes. I&#x27;m totally loving this eye cream. It is very easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky when you put it.</li>
    <li> I have puffy eyes, this eye cream tackles them, happy with the entire line.</li>
    <li> Skin burns me, I did not like odor is no better than instanatural</li>
    <li> Product works very well.  Seller was very prompt with delivery.</li>
    <li> I just received this product a couple of days but wanted to say that I can already tell a difference.  Area around eyes and eyelids feel softer, smoother and no longer look crepey(sp?).</li>
    <li> Love! Goes on so smooth, is so refreshing</li>
    <li> I have not been able to use the product for a full 6-8 weeks, so I am not prepared to give a complete answer on the results yet. However, I have not been disappointed so far. The smell is very pleasant. I’m not sure quite how to describe it, but it is definitely a natural smell, and not a chemical scent. It has a very light feeling and cool to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it can be used as a moisturizer for the entire face and hands as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely let you know when I have been using it longer</li>
    <li> This is a Great moisturizer.  It really leaves my skin soft. This brand is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> This product has a really strong odor. I bought it because I have puffy bags under my eyes and thought it might help reduce/prevent new wrinkles. Hasn&#x27;t done any thing</li>
    <li> Great product.  Have been using it for only a week, and I already notice a slight difference with my crow&#x27;s feet.  Still need to use it more to see if it makes a huge difference.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream. It works great and does everything an eye cream should do. This is the second product I&#x27;ve tried in the line and have been very happy with both products. I plan on purchasing more items by this company.</li>
    <li> This works! Let me tell you have very bad sleeping habits, and this has helped drastically! Works wonders, and my undereye circles are just not that dark anymore. I love it! I apply it twice a day. When I wake up and just before I sleep.</li>
    <li> OK so first I&#x27;m gonna start by saying this cream was shipped so quickly and the  company that makes it emailed me full detailed instructions on how to use it even before I received it. Now when it comes to consistency, I love it. Its very light weight and does not drag the skin around ur eyes and absorbs very well. And when it comes down to effectiveness I would say it has worked pretty well for me. I&#x27;m 24 but I have dark under eye circles and slight bags that make me look much older but I see a big difference in the darkness and I also feel like the skin is more supple around my eyes. I want to use this product longer and see how much more it can do for me. But when it finishes I&#x27;m definitely buying more. Oh and I almost forget to mention that it comes in a very convenient pump that let&#x27;s u use only as much as ur comfortable with. Thanks for making this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 30 days and I don&#x27;t think it has made any difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Thanks for a great and wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product -- I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the puffiness under my eyes.  I also love the way it goes on -- not greasy at all while still super moisturizing.  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I am 27 years old and I purchased this item to help with fine lines under my eyes. I have been using the product for 2 months now and I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference. I use the product both in the evening and in the morning. Also, this product does not help with dark circles. Once I&#x27;m done with this bottle, I will not purchase another one.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this product is natural. I started noticing about 3 days into using the product that my dark circles and puffiness under my eyes had greatly diminished. With continued use they have all but disappeared. If you do skip a day or two the dark circles do return so this product must be used daily. This product does have an odor upon first apply but is gone within 30 minutes or so. I would recommend to anyone with dark under-eye circles, great product.</li>
    <li> My dark circles are not as visible and the skin under my eyes is softer and no longer dry. Also helps when I&#x27;m wearing concealer because I noticed it lasting longer during the day which makes me feel like I picked a great product that actually works. I also enjoy the fact that the product is not heavy and it smells nice too. You don&#x27;t need much so be careful when pumping out the cream.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased and I&#x27;ll purchase again when I run out!</li>
    <li> Like the consistency and smell.  Feels soothing.</li>
    <li> Have been using this eye cream for a month now &amp; have noticed fewer wrinkles around my eyes....still have some puffiness which may be due to some allergies (use a nasal spray at times).  Will continue &amp; see if that problem get resolved.</li>
    <li> WHY OH WHY did I not find this incredible eye cream before spending TONS o&#x27; money on those much more expensive brands that do NOTHING? I am in love with this eye cream.  The first thing you&#x27;ll notice when it comes out of the pump is how incredibly light and moist it is.  Within the first couple of days, I noticed a dramatic improvement in the look of my eyes.  The white dots that had accumulated on my lids from using the aforementioned (oily, heavy and useless) creams were disappearing. The skin looked more nourished, more dewy.  I&#x27;ve been using the product now for about a month, and the difference is incredible. The only thing my Body Merry Eye Cream has left to tackle is the dark circles...and they are getting less pronounced. Still there...but I&#x27;m seeing improvement.  I am your biggest fan, Body Merry!!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference</li>
    <li> Really liking this stuff so far.  Skin is looking better.  Not an overnight miracle, but then again I didn&#x27;t get these crows feet overnight :-)</li>
    <li> Product smells good, and a little goes a long way. The quality of these product and customer service is very satisfactory, try the anti-cellulite cream if you haven&#x27;t. I will continue to use and purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works great! I noticed a difference rather quickly!</li>
    <li> I am not satisfied with the product. I have not seen any changes. As a matter of fact, I see more wrinkles under my eyes and also tiny bumps. I would like a refund for this product.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream. Use it morning &amp; evening.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Just started using this cream but usually everything makes me break out, not this cream though. Not greasy and does not burn my skin or make my eyes water. Hopefully it helps with the dark circles but I&#x27;m sure that will take a few weeks so I&#x27;ll update then :)</li>
    <li> Ok.. I&#x27;m breaking out more just under my eye area, but to be fair the acne could be stress related. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in dark circles. Fine lines may or may not be better. My eyes do feel more moisturized, much less tightness. I&#x27;ll keep using it but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s any better than others.</li>
    <li> Super awesome product! Feels great on my skin. Thank you :)</li>
    <li> noticeable difference! skin feels and looks healthier</li>
    <li> This did not get rid of my dark circles or wrinkles but I do like the feel and smell of it.  I have a feeling I was duped by many false reviews.</li>
    <li> I work about 18 hours every 9 days and notice my drake circles where noticeably reduced.</li>
    <li> I really like how this eye cream feels refreshing when I put it on.  I have noticed my skin feeling softer and looking a bit better around the eye area. I will be ordering this product again and again.</li>
    <li> I love this!!!!! Ohhhhhh it can burn, but it really does work! My eyes look so refreshed after using it! Not sure if the results are long term, but I love love love this! I am on the road a lot, under bright lights, and have long days... my eyes look tired more than I&#x27;d like. This product really helps!&lt;br /&gt;- Mrs. North American</li>
    <li> This cream goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  So far, I&#x27;m really happy with the results and it is all natural!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple weeks now. I haven&#x27;t noticed a change yet, but that can take a while. It goes on smooth, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. All pluses in my book.</li>
    <li> I like this product. Ive only been using it for a couple of weeks but its good. Not too heavy, not greasy. Pleasant smell. I like all the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Smooth and smells great!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and it smells great too!</li>
    <li> Too soon to tell and will check back.  So far (after 4 days of use) I have noticed smoother undereyes and hydration is excellent.  Smell is nice - you get used to it.  Will write more later!</li>
    <li> It helped a little bit with puffiness but made my dark circles more prominent</li>
    <li> This cream is very thin and I don&#x27;t care for the smell.  I tried using it but I noticed an immediate increase in fine lines and dark circles, so I guess the previous product I was trying worked a lot better.  I&#x27;d suggest paying slightly more for a better product.  I was happy with&lt;br /&gt;Andre Lorent CRAZY BEAUTIFUL Eye Wrinkle Cream and have reordered it.  It&#x27;s very creamy and I see immediate results.  So why did I try this other cream?  I&#x27;ve been trying different ones in search of a better product.  I can eliminate this one.</li>
    <li> Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream&lt;br /&gt;The eye cream is creamy it has a lite tingle but then its fine. No Odor is present. It can be worn under make-up. I thought it was a great product I did see a different in my eyes. So for the most part it has help my problem area. When I read the ingredients I liked the fact it had a combination of oils. The product was provided to me for free as part of a promotion and in exchanged I’m giving my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> LOVE this cream!!! it really helps with the dark circles under my eyes! I recommend giving it a try!</li>
    <li> Great product! Love it. I received this free or discounted to test and my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eye cream! I already bought a second one I love it so much. It has a very soothing and refreshing Green Tea Lime scent. I have actually been using it all over my face and neck as a moisturizer every morning before I put on my makeup. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looks much smoother and hydrated since I started using it 3 weeks ago. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my dark circles have gotten better. You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this cream!</li>
    <li> It does help my dark circles!</li>
    <li> Great cream, I love it</li>
    <li> I have used the product a few times and it does seem to make my skin softer. However, I have a problem getting past the smell. It reminds me of incense and that is too much for me to handle.</li>
    <li> This did not work fo rme.</li>
    <li> Great smell! Works great! Super great customer service :)</li>
    <li> Effective Eyecream . Simply the best bar none.</li>
    <li> Have not seen any difference in eye area.&lt;br /&gt;Liked the smoothness of this product.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it had made a difference.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I was unable to use this product long enough to see how well it worked. I tried it for a few days, but ultimately, the scent was too strong for me and I had to discontinue use. The smell is not unpleasant (it reminded me of citrus and sweet candy) but I found it to be too strong. It sat in my bathroom for a few weeks, and I had forgotten all about it until a company rep emailed me asking how the product was. I sent a reply explaining my situation, and was very quickly offered a full refund with no need to return the product. The entire refund was processed within 24 hours of my initial email, and the rep was very polite and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving 5 stars because with such excellent customer service, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong giving this product a try.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for about a week, and really I love it. I have thin skin and fine lines under my eyes, and the fat injections I got to help pad them out 10 years ago have turned into little bags. I have tried so many eye creams, moisturizers and serums. After just a week using this product, combined with the HYALURONIC ACID SERUM from the same company, I have seen and can feel a noticeable improvement. It&#x27;s winter here, and the heater in our house really dries out the air, my skin, and mucus membranes (which are naturally dry to begin with). I apply this product, plus the serum, morning and night, sometimes locking it in with Paula&#x27;s Choice moisturizer, and I love the effect. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, gummy, goopy or crusty. It absorbs quickly and leaves skin feeling dewy and young, like a baby&#x27;s skin. I can layer makeup over it, and it doesn&#x27;t gum up or change the texture in any negative way, and my makeup doesn&#x27;t move around on top.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the dispenser needs a little ring added under the pump so less product is dispenced . You only need about half a pump. A little goes a long way. If you pump carefully and slowly, the right amount comes out, but it would be nice if there was a stopper under the pump to help measure out the product so you don&#x27;t get too much. If that small issue could be addressed without increasing the price of the product, I would be delighted.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I will purchase both products again, and I am looking forward to trying other products in this line. The dark circles and wrinkles under my eyes are the bane of my existence, and the only indicator that I am actually 40. While these products don&#x27;t eliminate the problem (which is mostly genetic for me), they do go a long way to help minimize the problem without creating other issues like most creams do. I also love that they are natural and cruelty free, which are high priorities for me.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is awesome. It smells great, and I&#x27;m already noticing a difference in my dark circles under my eye. Will be using this for a while!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have tried this product, and I am really liking it!</li>
    <li> So far so good. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week now so no visual results yet, but the smell is  amazing!</li>
    <li> I love this product and have noticed a difference in the fine wrinkles I started getting around my eyes over the last few years.  I just ordered my second bottle (the first one lasted at least 6 months).  Definitely a great price!  Planning to keep ordering.  Oh, and it smells soooo good too!</li>
    <li> All the Merry Products far exceeded my expectations.  I am 51 and avoid the sun completely.  Having worked for a dermatologist in the past, I also use Retin A religiously.  Since using the Merry Products, my husband even said my skin looks younger.  After all my years of paying a fortune for Strivectin, never once did he tell me that.  I am now a forever customer.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works well. It&#x27;s light, but moisturizing. Smells pleasant too. Both my husband and I use this now! Highly recommend for ANYONE!</li>
    <li> I really like this product !!! ... I&#x27;ve been using it with a Vit C serum first, then the cream, then ROC moisturizer  ... Use it Not just eye area , but whole face !!! 3 weeks have been using ... Don&#x27;t even need a color correction (foundation or BBcream)&lt;br /&gt;Alot comes out with the pump ( more than you woul need for eye area) but I like that since using on whole face .... Has a nice light scent .... Will definitely be ordering another bottle!!!</li>
    <li> Smells great and is really moisturizing. Smells divine and the smell is not at all overwhelming. I have no issue wearing it to bed or outdoors and doesn&#x27;t cause cakey-ness. It soaks up quickly as well and a little goes a long way. I see this lasting me FOREVER!</li>
    <li> This product smells very nice and is a wonderful moisturizer.  It has a refreshing feel when applied.  I felt for my upper lids it lightened them temporarily.  However, I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable improvements in the appearance of my dark circles or fine lines.  I recommend this as a refreshing under eye moisturizer only.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It smells great and does what it says it does. I used skin media eye cream before and this works even better. I will order again!</li>
    <li> The scent is wonderful and herbal.  The product is non-greasy and soaks in well.  I really think it helps alleviate the dark circles under my eyes.  I use it before bed and before putting on makeup in the morning.</li>
    <li> I like this product. It&#x27;s really nice filled on skin under eyes and leads. I feel relaxation. My eyes look younger with some disappearance of wrinkles and dark spots after using this cream</li>
    <li> My new favorite eye cream! It&#x27;s better than the expensive ones I used to buy. It smells great and it really hydrates. It is also good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> After using the first bottle for over a month, I didn&#x27;t see any positive result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have not seen much of a change</li>
    <li> I like the added moisture to the area around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Smells good, three days in use - still like it, nice package.</li>
    <li> What an excellent product and great value. A tiny bit goes a long way and I felt better in using it after a week.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream morning and night for a couple of weeks and I love it. The smell is light and it goes on creamy, yet not greasy. The skin under my eyes stays moisturized for hours!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using this product it was gentle on my skin. I could definitely tell the difference after just a week of using it. The dark circles around my eyes are brighter and Ive been searching a long time to find a product that would help me with this. Very happy I tried this!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feel of this eye cream.  A little goes a long way when used under and around the eyes.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is a dream ,, it goes on so smooth and the smell is wonderful. I love this eye cream for many reasons, it doesn&#x27;t get crumbly when I put on my makeup like most eye creams i have tried, it really takes away the puffiness in the morning when I wake up and makes my eyes look refreshed and alive. I only been using it for a week and notice a difference in the fine lines. I have tried the retinol and neck cream from Body Merry and they are all amazing. Very affordable and better than most expensive products that do nothing but break your bank account. If you want results and great products I highly recommend this company.</li>
    <li> This eye cream was ok but keep drying my skin out under the eyes,</li>
    <li> After an almost a week. of using of this product, i&#x27;ve noticed that the darken circle on my eyes was getting lighten, I have a insomia that&#x27;s why the inner of my eyes was really darken before, but now i found the answer. It&#x27;s really awesome!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t eat that great and drink lots of caffeine which I be adds to dark circles under my eyes. After just 1 week of using this product I have noticed a considerable difference. No more dark rings, smooth to the touch. I really like that this is not oily and dries quickly. I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> With most things I buy, I don&#x27;t want to take the time to write any review because I am pretty busy and figure that someone else will do it. This time is different. I want to tell you my experience with this product. I ordered this a month ago and received it very quickly and in perfect condition. After using this for a month I can say that the product is nothing less than amazing. I am 60 and my skin is very, very dry and crepey. I have circles and bags and lots of smile wrinkles. All of my friends have noticed an improvement in my eye area and their appearance. That is after just one month! Can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in a few more months! I like the pump style but this is a product where a little goes a long, long way, so don&#x27;t be afraid to use only half a pump&#x27;s worth. I think the packaging could be prettier and the customer service department said they are working on that. Their customer service department, by the way, is excellent. Quick to reply to any concerns. I will definitely be buying this product again and have recommended it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  Non greasy, absorbs well, and does seem to make my eyes look brighter, diminishing darkening spots and puffiness.  Glad I tried it!!</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it is wishful thinking or not..but I think it may be helping with the dark circles under my eyes. I notice that I am not having to use as much concealer as before, and it is not getting all caked up after hours of wear. I have not had to &amp;#34;redo&amp;#34; my makeup before going out in the evening since I started using this stuff. It is a little expensive, but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> tried it for the first time and I like it! It definitely brightens the eye area and lifts as well. I love that its an all natural option and it smells wonderful! I think this company will do great! Great product! And a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about 2 weeks and I can see a positive difference already! Works and smells great! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The product shipped quick and arrived in perfect shape. The package came in several layers of bubble wrap. I love this product because it&#x27;s made with natural and organic ingredients, no harsh chemicals are added and NOT tested on ANIMALS. I have wrinkles on my forehead from making funny faces over the years and smoking. I&#x27;m 22 turning 23 in September and have wrinkles and have dark under eye circles from the sleepiness nights. This product has made a huge impact on the first couples uses on my dark under eye circles. After using for about 2 weeks I noticed a big change in my forehead wrinkles. I used a tiny amount each time. I love how the dispenser only squeezes out just that tiny amount at a time instead of a a huge clump on your hands (saying what am I suppose to do with all this). A little goes a very long way, so I can see this lasts a while. It leaves my skin so soft and smooth. It has a wonderful smell and it&#x27;s just highly effective from all the ingredients in it. I was very surprised how fast acting this eye cream really works. It&#x27;s also guaranteed or your money back. I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> This cream is light and sinks into the skin quickly. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s doing much to help with dark circles or poochy undereyes, but it feels nice anyway. I&#x27;m not really sure if ANY of these types of products help with circles and wrinkles, though. I like that it&#x27;s natural ingredients, so I don&#x27;t have to worry if some accidentally gets into my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting a good eye cream. Since losing 130 pounds the wrinkles and crows feet around my eyes have gotten significantly worse. I have always had big bags under my eyes as well as dark circles. I was given the opportunity to try this eye cream for free in return for an honest product review. It came in a pretty big plastic bottle with a nice little pump on the top. The cream is nice and thick and goes on evenly. I made sure to rub it is gently to make sure I didn&#x27;t damage the sensitive skin underneath my eyes. Just a small amount of the cream went a long way and rubbed in well. I have been using it two times daily and have noticed a big difference! The dark circles have been lightening the bags are going away and the fine lines are decreasing. My whole eye area looks brighter and makes me look more awake and vibrant. I will continue to use!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s no different than a moisturizer.. it doesn&#x27;t help with dark circles, lines or puffiness. I&#x27;ve been using it for a LONG time. Smells like aveda hairspray, for smell reference.</li>
    <li> My sister-in -law had puffiness around her eyes for years. She said she tried a few products, but they did not work for her.  She tried this eye cream and it worked for her. She looks much younger without the puffiness around her eyes. She said the product was easy to use and worked great. There were no side affects. The product is worth the time, money and effort.</li>
    <li> My eyes are less puffy and dark after using this twice a day for about two weeks. And I love the way it smells. I wish I could wear it as perfume.</li>
    <li> It does what it promises. My dark circles are definitely fading after using it a couple of days. I am pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I revived this product to reviews and I love the way it feels.It apply smooth and smells good. I don&#x27;t have any dark spots but it moisturize well.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Great consistency (not too thick and not runny). I can feel the moisturizing effects right away and leaves the skin around my eyes feeling and looking soft, smooth, and bright. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is thick and creamy! The container is also a great size for the price! This item was sent to me for review of my unbiased opinion by the seller</li>
    <li> This eye cream has a great scent, is very smooth, and has great results. I noticed a huge change in the dark circles under my eyes, after one day of using the product. It has lots of great botanical ingredients, as well as retinol and hyaluronic acid. I recommend this to anyone looking for a good anti aging eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product free for review purposes, but I only recommend products that I would use myself.</li>
    <li> This cute little package works wonders on my under eyes. I was lucky enough to be aloud to test this product by the company. Let me just say how glad I am that I was able to find this company. I&#x27;ve struggled with dark and puffy eyes for years and only now can I say I have found a perfect product for myself. The serum melts nicely on the under eyes without feeling cakey or oily. Overall I love this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve quickly fallen for this product. As someone who sleeps very little and has some pretty serious under eye baggage, I&#x27;ve noticed a nice change with this product. I used to use All About Eyes from clinique which is an expensive product. For a time it worked wonders but as of late, it was letting me down and the results tapered off.&lt;br /&gt;With this product I like the cool sensation and the scent is a light and refreshing minty sort of thing that immediately makes me feel more awake and less droopy. I recommend!</li>
    <li> Disclaimer:  I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Review: I have only recently this year started using Eye cream to help reduce black/ purple circles, bags, and minimal eye wrinkles under my eyes.  So to get a product that works to reduce, or erase/ eliminate that is natural and organic is great news for me.  Body Merry&#x27;s eye cream is really smooth to use, light weight, easy to apply and quickly rubs in, all aspects of a product anyone would want.  I have never noticed this before, but this product does have a scent/ smell its slight, but its from the essential oils used in this product.  Don&#x27;t worry about this smell/ scent once the product is absorbed it goes away, but this can be used as a measuring tool, when you don&#x27;t smell it anymore you know its been completely absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product you want to use on a daily basis so you can see results.  I will be honest its not a product that you use once and see immediate results, but with constant usage you will see results.  My eyes no longer have the blackish-purple circles when I have a rough night with lack of sleep (thanks to being a Mommy), I don&#x27;t have bags, or if I do, when I put this on in the morning I will see a quick result in the bags being gone shortly after finishing my morning makeup/ skin care routine.  One of the best parts of this product is that a little goes a long way.  I use about a pea sized bit to be split between both my eyes.  So this bottle has already lasted me months, and will continue to last me a while longer as well.  Everyone says that your eyes are like a window to the soul, so when your eyes look tired and puffy despite you being happy, when I&#x27;m in that type of situation I would want my skin to show my happiness.  With Body Merry&#x27;s product I feel like my skin can reflect my happiness, and health despite sometimes or more often than I plan on having rough parenting nights sleep.  The images of my face the before and after literally happened within a 5 minute period.  I put the cream on, let it dry/ absorb then took the after picture.  You can see the bags have already deflated under my eyes.  I will recommend this product!ometimes or more often than I plan on having rough parenting nights sleep.

    <li> After using this for 2 months, I am finally seeing some improvement..am thinking that I was not applying enough of it at first.</li>
    <li> I think I see a slight difference. Not sure if i can truly make a complete review on this.</li>
    <li> Not noticed any positive effect in terms of decrease in puffiness or swelling of eyes, I had better expectations about this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry but with this product I do not see any positive results to correct puffiness and swelling in the area of my eyes</li>
    <li> This works! The fine lines at the corners of my eyes have virtually disappeared in just over one month. I am now using it on my eyelids carefully to see if there is any improvement to the start of droopy eyelid syndrome. Have to do all you can do at 61 you know LOL.</li>
    <li> I did not see any difference after using this product for several weeks.</li>
    <li> I am giving this a 5 star review despite the fact that my skin was sensitive to it. The company stands behind it&#x27;s products and gave me a refund. I have problematic skin so I am sure this will be good for others. It did go on well and absorbed well.</li>
    <li> better than I could have ever expected.  Not being able at the moment to buy my normal Lancome products, I tried this as a cheaper alternative, and I am pretty amazed at the results.</li>
    <li> Very good quality, I love it.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Eye Cream I actually use it as an all over cream and it hydrates my skin very well as well as keeping the dark circles an puffy eyes at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can read my full review by visiting my blog by using the link below&lt;br /&gt;http://acountrygirlcanreviews.blogspot.com/2014/08/body-merry-age-defense-eye-cream.html</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 20s and have been using eyecreams and moisturizers since my early 20s to help prevent signs of aging. I&#x27;ve used some that were sticky, heavy, melted into my eyes, and overall didn&#x27;t have any effect until I tried Body Merry&#x27;s. I have been using morning and night and it actually works really well under makeup. I also really love the pump. It&#x27;s easy to use and prevents getting too much. It&#x27;s light, cooling, and refreshing.  I would continue to buy this for the many benefits and healthy components. I definitely recommend if you are in need of a light eye cream that&#x27;s great for day wear and doesn&#x27;t melt into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt; I received the products mentioned above for complimentary for testing purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers</li>
    <li> It did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> I find this eye cream works average.  It does not help with puffiness and I still have to ue a cover up. It is better then the over-the-counter ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought all those really expensive eye creams like we all do.. I thought I&#x27;d give this a try since it got such good reviews&lt;br /&gt;here on Amazon.. Well, IT WORKS!!  I saw results right away!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 weeks. I own a Hair Salon called The Mane Attraction in Portland , Me.( shameless plug) &amp; all my clients have been asking if I&#x27;ve had something done.&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day , before &amp; after I take off my makeup  It feels silky and smells so clean. My little lines under my eyes are gone!&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased and have passed it along to all my female clients &amp; friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely endorse a product but I MUST encourage you to get this!</li>
    <li> This eye cream is starting to help my very dry skin. I have tried everything but this seems to work. It feels good to see the lines less  intense. It doesn&#x27;t take very much either.</li>
    <li> I am 25 years old, and although I don&#x27;t have wrinkles (yet!), I do suffer from dry skin, especially around my eye brow / upper eye area. Normally trying to find a product to use for my dry skin that is safe to use around the eyes is very hard to find. However this eye cream is just that, made to be used around the eyes. So I feel a lot better using it on my dry patches around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use, I simply take a pea size amount, and place it on the spots where I suffer dryness. I do this on freshly washed and cleansed skin. The pea sized amount is enough to use on both of my eye areas where I get the dry flaky patches. I let it set for 5 minutes, then I can proceed with the rest of my skincare routine. Since using this, I have noticed that the dry spots aren&#x27;t near as flaky, or red. I don&#x27;t have that itchy feeling either anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this about 3-4 times a week now, and I still have plenty of product left in the tube to use. The only reason why this isn&#x27;t getting a full 5 stars is simply due to the price. While it is currently on sale as I write this review, it is still a bit more expensive than what I would like to pay for it. I have used other products in the past that have helped me out equally to this one, but were a good $8-$10 cheaper with the same amount of product. If the price was a bit more competitive to others that I have seen and used on the market, this rating would go up to 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> This eye cream I purchased it after reading the reviews. I was a bit scared but I went for it and I am glad I did. I have been using it I believe for about 2 weeks now and although I have not seen a huge difference I do see something happening. My wrinkles seem to be a little less deep. I loved the fact that the seller sent me an email with the best way of using this product. That was awesome and important to me. Wish others sellers would do the same. The only reason I am giving them a 4 star is because I want to see what else this eye cream will do for me. I have wrinkles under my eyes and forehead and I have notice a bit of a change but not huge. But I will continue to use it and will  be back with a new post about it. Right now I can say that you only need about a pea side of the product it goes a long way and it&#x27;s smooth and it has a sort of a smell to it but when it absorbs which it does quickly the smell is gone. Some reviewers are say that the smell is like cucumber and mint. Maybe so but I would not say is a great smell. I will be back soon and let you know what else this eye cream did for me.</li>
    <li> I have to be honest and tell you that I had to pull up the product details off Amazon because the print on the bottle is so tiny I would need a magnifying glass to read it. So if you order tis product, be sure to bookmark this page.&lt;br /&gt;Well that sounds pretty good! I love the fact that it is not tested on animals!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this cream for about 5 days now and i got to tell you, I really haven&#x27;t seen to much of a difference yet. I am going to continue to use it a couple more weeks. It does have a nice scent and it is not to greasy or oily. It actually dissolves quickly in to your skin. I have been using it in the mornings before i put my make up on and at night after I cleanse my face. I would like to say I wish it had a SPF or sunscreen in it.&lt;br /&gt;I do feel fresher after applying.</li>
    <li> I really like this product although it will not make the lines disappear-probably no product can do that.  It feels wonderful, awesome texture, great clean smell (which disappears quickly, so won&#x27;t offend anyone).  It maintains softness and moisture IMO.  Would recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin, which I have.  It will not cause any unpleasant reaction.</li>
    <li> Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream comes in a plastic bottle which contains 30ml product. This eye cream is white and creamy and it has barely noticeable scent.(It smells like licorice, apple and I love that)&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is very light and absorbs quickly leaving eye area nicely moisturised. I noticed my dark circles becoming lighter and lighter by every day and fine lines around my eye area have almost diminished. It contains an impressive mix of proven hydrating ingredients like Jojoba Oil,beeswax, Cocoa butter.&lt;br /&gt;It is made in USA and has not been tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion this is a pretty good eye cream. I noticed a big effect on fine lines, it made my under eye area look lighter and I liked that Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream absorbs quickly leaving my eye area moisturised.&lt;br /&gt;It is difficult to get an eye product that looks as though it works...but this one really does seem to do a good job..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I purchase it again?Yes of course.</li>
    <li> Nothing to say except the issue has not gotten worse. It is, however, no better.</li>
    <li> I love this product  it really works. Used this product for about 2 weeks and within days I could see a difference on my skin, the dark circles and puffiness were going away within days. The formula is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, it smells real goodmtoo, smells just like cucumbers, yum. My skin is hydrated and my under eyes get moisturized. This product is organic and cruelty free which is why I really like the body merry products. I got this product free from Body Merry through tomoson.com</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this eye cream because of all the good ingredients it has and even waited an additional month to see results, but unfortunately I have not seen a difference in my eye area.  It is a nice feeling eye cream, but it does not work on me.  First company that I have dealt with though that checks in with you on their product, that is a plus, just wish the eye cream was much better.</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I have ratcoon eyes and I have a hard time finding a product that will work for my eyes. This cream worked instantly. I love the way it smells, feels and everything about it. The only thing I did not like about it was the handle on mine broke, so i had to maneuver it out of the bottle. I received this for free, but my opinion is honest.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a month now. I&#x27;m almost 30, Black/Japanese with sensitive skin. I&#x27;m an engineer that works in a construction related field and as such don&#x27;t wear make up on a daily basis.  I *try* to wear sunscreen when I&#x27;m out in the field. Up until recently I didn&#x27;t have a skin care regime at all.  I mean I washed my face with the same soap I wash everything else with.  But as 30 looms I wanted to be proactive about skin care so I could keep not needing make up on a daily basis. Also I get dark circles due to lack of sleep and diet and they had been gettin worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally I use this morning and night. About 1 pump  does my whole face and neck. I notice my skin looks brighter, feels softer, and my dark circles have faded significantly.  My face always has that &amp;#34;been on holiday&amp;#34; of being well rested now. It goes fine under my sunscreen as well as under makeup when I do wear it (BB Cream). At night I layer it under my water gel mask. Also it&#x27;s less than half empty after a month so I think it&#x27;s worth the money considering that.</li>
    <li> No worth your time or money. I have tried many eye creams and am always on the lookout for newer, better stuff. This hydrates, but no better than a $2 cream. Save your money and try something else instead.</li>
    <li> I was given the opportunity to try this product for reviewing purposes and was very surprised by how well it worked. Repeat use definitely gives better results. It&#x27;s definitely a finer cream that goes into the delicate under-eye skin. Wears will under makeup and doesn&#x27;t roll like some eye creams do</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t applied eye cream in a long time and I am telling you I regret that I always skip this important step in my skin rituals. I did use other eye creams in the past and not really seeing any change, I then decided to stop and not use them. Given the opportunity to review this, I now see how relevant to take care of the skin around eye area. True to words, this product gave me some insight how crucial an eye cream is. Since I am past 25 years old, and according to what I have learned in my benevolent nursing career, skin starts to disintegrate slowly and will happen speedily if you smoke or exposed/ingest harsh chemicals. In order to combat these, one must be prepared in all measures. So I gave it a try and was astounded how fast it dries and has lightweight property for easy application. It has a soothing cool effect to wake up tired eyes in the morning and to remove baggy eyes from a midnight of Netflix or video editing. Overall, I like the effect it gives me so much the more I apply it before my makeup routine to give me a flawless canvass to work on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other skincare products, patience is the key to witness a change. Just give it time to adjust and you will see effects in a few days and weeks. Don&#x27;t forget to stay religious to your routine. Me? I love doing my skincare rituals, it is relaxing and therapeutic.</li>
    <li> Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream comes in an airless plastic container with a pump, which I appreciate because bacteria can&#x60;t get inside the tube. The cream has kind of a strong sweet herbal scent which does not bother me, but even if you are sensitive to scents, I don&#x60;t think that you will have problem with this one, because you will not smell it once applied on the face. Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream has very light, thin consistency and just a little bit goes a long way. Be careful with the pump, because releases too much product and you have to slightly tap rather than pressing it, in order to get the right amount without wasting any product. This cream leaves my under eye area feeling very comfortable, soft and moisturized. I love that it absorbs completely but still leaves the skin hydrated and brightened up. This eye cream does not leave any greasy or sticky residues unlike many other eye creams and is perfect for under makeup. I have received tons of expensive high quality eye creams thanks to subscription boxes, but Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream is probably one of the best I have ever used. It may sound like I exaggerate, but I am not. I am very pleased and happy with this product and I will recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;_______________________&lt;br /&gt;PR Sample. All opinions are my own and 100% honest.</li>
    <li> I am purchasing my second tube/container of this today.  I still have another tube but I don&#x27;t want to run out.  It&#x27;s rare that I re-order beauty items, they have to produce real results for a follow up purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff delivers. First off about me, i am a 37 year old white female, former obsessive tanner and smoker. I also have bad allergies and a thyroid condition, both of these cause under eye puffiness. I can sleep for 10 hours and still wake up with puffy under eyes; this is what i initially purchased this item for. After about 4 days of consistent use day and night, I first noticed my eyes were &amp;#34;lightening up&amp;#34; underneath. I didn&#x27;t even realize I had a bit of dark circles going on, so seeing the skin under my eyes improve was great. In another two days I noticed the puffiness under my eyes truly was diminishing. I looked refreshed and 5 years younger. I really could&#x27;t believe it.  Since I have been using this product my eyes look at least 85% better. I look younger and much less tired. I love the cool clean feeling this has when you first put it on. This applies smooth and cools your skin different than any other gel/eye cream I&#x27;ve ever tried. As for the fine line reduction, I haven&#x27;t really noticed any improvement in that area, but luckily they aren&#x27;t that bad to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of people read these reviews and probably don&#x27;t believe it but I can attest that this is just short of a miracle product. For someone who suffers with tired looking eyes from an underlying health condition and severe pollen allergies, this has produced drastic results in my appearance. I feel much more confident and pretty again, I get compliments all the time on how young I look; (that hasn&#x27;t happened in a few years). I would not want to be without this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a solid month, there is nothing more I can say besides.....it really works and for the price it&#x27;s an amazing deal. Try it out, they have a money back guarantee so you really have nothing to lose. For under eye puffiness and dark circles, this is your product. Very happy customer.uarantee so you really have nothing to lose. For under eye puffiness and dark circles, this is your product. Very happy customer.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it smells great, and I notice a difference around my eyes. You get a large amount for a good price. And it works just as (actually better than) well as the high end 50-100 dollar eye creams in my opinion. (I have tried both) I also really like the easy to use pump, so I don&#x27;t have to dip my finger into a jar, which can lead to bacteria growth in the product etc. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> first of all....I was not given free product so my review is totally unbiased. With that being said, the reviews that I read piqued my interest enough to purchase this great product. I just turned 60 years old and even though I have taken care of my skin and spent thousands on beauty products through the years, something was lacking. So, I purchased this eye cream and was immediately impressed. Within a day or two, the under-eye puffiness was decreased dramatically and the fine lines were softening overall. I love the scent and the consistency which is like heavy cream which sinks in the skin and does not interfere with makeup, etc. I WILL purchase again.....oh, and a very tiny amount goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product not only because of the minimal cost but because it works!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t compliment it enough! It removed my dark circles and My eyes aren&#x27;t puffy even if I lack sleep. The best eye cream out there!</li>
    <li> I was looking for an eye cream and a neck cream that worked well on dark circles and lines around the eyes. I was also looking for something for dry skin vertical wrinkles that appeared along the center of my neck. I actually tried quite a few products . With the other products I had some improvement  with the eye area and no improvement with the neck area. I decided to look at the reviews on Amazon and found the Body Merry products and read all the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to email Body Merry for more info and to my surprise I received an almost immediate response from the owner of the company or at least who I think is the owner. The persons name is Khushboo. I asked a lot of detailed questions and I am not kidding when I can report that I received at least personal 6 emails answering my questions as I am very detail oriented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Khushboo suggested a combination of three products Pro -A-Serum, their  eye cream and their neck cream. Kushboo suggested to first apply the Pro A but I have actually not used this yet, followed by the eye cream around the eyes and the neck cream on the neck and the entire face followed by a sun screen of my choosing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the eye cream around the eyes, the neck cream everywhere else and Neutrogena SPF 45 over that. I have been using this for about a month. I am happy to report that I have noticed a very definite improvement in all areas. The wrinkles (kind of like chicken skin) have completely disappeared from my neck. I am not kidding. I have also noticed a significant tightened of the skin and reduction of wrinkles around my eyes and some reduction of dark circles around the eyes but not as much of a reduction as a reduction of the wrinkles and the tightening of the skin. I have even noticed an improvement on the somewhat small wrinkles in the corner of the eyes. I have also noticed an improvement in any bagginess I might have had under my eyes but my bags are pretty tight as they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are good products and this is a good company. They care about their customers and you should consider them.hese are good products and this is a good company. They care about their customers and you should consider them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for 2 months now, but I&#x27;m afraid I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable difference. I must admit I don&#x27;t have dark circles or puffiness, just some age wrinkles which to me do not look any different after 2 months of applying this cream. It leaves the skin mosturized for sure, but that&#x27;s pretty much it for me.</li>
    <li> Very light but very effective.  Sinks in immediately.</li>
    <li> This stuff worked wonders! I could definitely tell a difference in the way my eyes looked after about a week of use. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> The product has a sheer yet luxurious feel to it and a light, pleasant scent. I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This is the second purchase for this eye cream.  I am reviewing it now because when I reviewed the first bottle I really did not do it justice.  It is a light cream that absorbs great.  Does it remove wrinkles ... no, not at least on my face.  To be fair ... I doubt there is a cream in the world that is going to really abolish lines and wrinkles around this old lady&#x27;s face.  What I like about this cream is that it is not heavy nor is it sticky.  I like pump bottles because I have long fingernails and I don&#x27;t like to dig into jars of cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would like to add that the people who make it had contacted me a couple of times and have been really pleasant and professional, and they have offered at least twice to refund my money because the pump on the first bottle was flakey ... but I declined the offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you like a light eye cream that absorbs quickly and does not leave a sticky feel ... this is the eye cream for you.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a good solid week before I decided to post a review about it so that I can give y&#x27;all more details. &#x3D;) The first thing I noticed when I started using this cream, was the fact that it was very gentle on the eye area. I have used so many eye creams in the past and I have had to chunk most of them or return them to the store because I could not stand the burning sensation that I experience when I use them around my eye area. I have very sensitive skin...and a much more sensitive eye area, so you can just imagine my frustration when I&#x27;m shopping for eye (skin) care products. Body Merry&#x27;s Eye Cream has been so gentle on my skin and I noticed that it easily gets absorbed as well - very impressive, might I add! The skin around my eyes also tend to get very dry and no matter how much I moisturize, it just gets extra flaky on some days. After using Body Merry&#x27;s Eye Cream for several days...I have not been plagued with that dryness anymore! I almost always wake up to puffy eyes before I started using this eye cream but ever since I started using it...no more puffy eyes! I love this eye cream...it&#x27;s the only one that has worked for me and my sensitive skin! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;lll switch brands after using this! &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for other consumers like myself. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> When given the opportunity to try Body Merry Eye Defense Eye Cream, I was absolutely delighted. You see, nine months ago I had a heart procedure done and since then the dark night of circles has encamped round-about my peepers. I&#x27;ve always had a bit of under-the-eye dark, but this is different. So when Body Merry Eye Cream alluded to helping with those fierce dark circles, I jumped on board. Now just what has Body Merry done for me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a sort of liquid type cream. When I pat it around the eyes (under, both sides, lids), it has a pleasant tingly sensation. Not a burning. It just feels different from others I have used.  I have applied this morning and evening for a couple of weeks. Has it worked a miracle? No. Do my eyes look better in the morning when I awaken? Absolutely yes! Do they stay looking pretty decent (for a lady-of-a-certain-age) throughout the day? Yes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I say this is a product I feel I can recommend. It is pleasant to use and seems to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review. Opinions are solely my own. I was not compensated for this review.</li>
    <li> I have been using this over two months and have seen zero results. I am only 33 and this has done nothing to lighten dark circles or even affect my fine &amp;#34;squint&amp;#34; lines. I don&#x27;t have any crows feet so I cant attest to that. I gave it 2 stars because it does moisturize some and smells good.</li>
    <li> Nice eye cream, but did itching for wrinkles or dark circles.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product and already the skin under my eyes look brighter and smoother! Will continue to use this product and share the news to the women in my family!!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Doesn&#x27;t smell like anything bad</li>
    <li> wonderful, i had a black mark under my eye the black mark went away within days WONDER ... WOULD BUY AGAIN&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;visit www.akreviews.com THIS REVIEW WILL GO LIVE ON MY BLOG SOON!</li>
    <li> There are three things I like about this product.&lt;br /&gt;1. You can&#x27;t beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;2. A little goes a long way - I purchased this in the beginning of August and it&#x27;s now December 22 and I&#x27;m just barely starting to feel like I&#x27;ll need to replenish in 3 - 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;3. It works. You will not get immediate results but if you stick with it, you&#x27;ll start to see improvements!! I started seeing improvements maybe after about a month or so. When I smile, the crows feet around my eyes have definitely diminished and no more dark circles (I&#x27;m a night owl). In fact, in the past month or so, I&#x27;ve noticed a string of compliments/comments about how I look like I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties (I&#x27;m 34). Maybe it&#x27;s a coincidence but I&#x27;m convinced this eye cream has something to do with that.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried my share of anti-aging products, including eye creams...and yes, pricey, fancy ones. This is the ONLY eye cream I&#x27;m going to buy again. In the past, I&#x27;ve always wanted to try something new. TRY IT!!! I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
    <li> Best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever gotten. Gets rid of those dark circles and softens the area around your eye too. The smell is also invigorating.</li>
    <li> As with most creams, I am not sure of the success of the claims, but what I really like about the cream is its consistency.  It is a perfect combination of creaminess- not too thick, not too thin and not greasy. My skin goes &amp;#34;ahh&amp;#34; when I apply.  I love the light fragrance- I am not a heavy flower scent person.  I have tried many creams in this price range and this is my favorite so far.  I also apply it above my lip, figuring that skin on the face, is skin on the face (am I wrong?)</li>
    <li> I love all creams with retinol as I have some fine lines all over my face. In a short trial using this, I saw less lines, and softer skin! I feel like a little bit of this cream will go a long way. I will be happy to have it in my medicine cabinet for quite some time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great company with some really great products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for providing a product for review on my blog.</li>
    <li> Great eye cream! I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference in the crow&#x27;s feet by my eyes.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month, so to me, that is amazing!  The only negative for me is that when you pump it out, you get a lot of cream - more than needed, in my opinion.  I&#x27;ve just rubbed the extra on the back of my hands.  I love this eye cream and highly recommend it. I did receive a complimentary bottle to review for my blog, but this is my honest opinion of the product.</li>
    <li> After about a week of using it, people started telling me that I looked more rested. Can&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> I just want to let people who read this. I have been using this product more than 14 days. With any new product you start you are not going to see immediate results. Most take a few days to a couple weeks to see results. With that said I am noticing the dark circles to lighten up. Now if you have super dark circles it will take time. Please remember if you have an heredity of dark circles then some people will always live with some sort of dark circles. Now with the fine lines and wrinkles if they are on the lighter side like mine. I am noticing the lighter lines diminishing. Now the heavier lines are getting less but I do still have them. What I love about the company they are cruelty free which is the trend for skin care and makeup lines now days.  This only take 1/4 to 1/2 pump for the under eyes. Now a couple tricks I have learned is to if you have left over on your fingers after blending it in. You can dab between the eyebrows and upper eye brow. It is a little trick for helping lift the eye area.  I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience!  There is enough and absorbs nicely into the skin. This product is a vegan formula for those of you are watching for that ingredients. On thing to remember it to use light touch while applying any product at the eye area. If you keep pulling and tugging at the eyes you will be doing damage to your eye area. One last thing to add. I am starting to look like I am not so tired by using this product. My eyes look more lively and awake.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Haven&#x27;t really seen a difference though</li>
    <li> This wonderful product has all of the current best anti aging ingredients and is the nicest feeling deep moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried yet.  I would be using it now but there is one natural herb in the formula that I personally have never liked and I could smell it.  My boyfriend thought it smelled delicious, a lemony scent.</li>
    <li> Best eye cream I have tried!  I have tried a few and this one is so refreshing.  My eyes feel so good after applying it and always with a cool effect.  My puffiness is gone, my dark circles are lighter.  I really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The product really work well, I observed a difference after one week of using the product.  I didn&#x27;t have any skin irritation, in fact I look younger, THANKS to the eye cream. Product  worked so well, I  already purchased a second bottle. I would recommend this product for anyone who suffer with dark circles around the eyes.</li>
    <li> Nice cream! I&#x27;ve tried many eye creams and for the first time this one actually seems to work (skin around my eyes looks tighter, fewer lines and not quite so dark). It also feels refreshing without having odor or a tingling feeling. I will be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely product, very refreshing and natural.  I think it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s chemical- and preservative-free, and absorbs quickly into the skin.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I really like this so far! I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to have a say, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> After placing my order I received an e-mail from the company thanking me for my purchase and to let me know if I have any problems with the product to contact them.  This was very pleasant, and rare.  Right away I felt like I made a good choice with this purchase.  I received my order quickly and it was packaged in a very secure matter so my product was pristine.  Right away I started using it and it is good thus far, it absorbs quickly into the skin and has a nice smell.  I will post another review after I have used the product for the recommended time to see results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while.I still have the dark circles under my eyes and fine lines.Is it anything else out there I could use for this problem.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice moisturizing eye cream, great for under make up, But (!) in 1,5 month of using it I have seen a very slight improvement on my puffiness and NO any effect on under eye dark circles or wrinkles. Therefore no more than 2 stars from me</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time as promised. I liked the consistency of the cream when applied around the eye area, however, after use for a couple days I had some type of reaction to the ingredients. The very positive rating is left as a result of fantastic customer service after contacting the seller. I would still recommend the product, give it a try, it might work for you!</li>
    <li> This eye cream is OK.  It has quite a gingery fragrance to it and I honestly find it almost like sticking my face in a big glass of ginger ale.  It gives my eyes that same sort of stingy feeling.  It&#x27;s a bit hard to get to absorb and adds a fair bit of time to my routine because I have to wait for it to absorb.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this item again.  I got it as a promotion so not out anything trying it.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it&#x27;s natural and organic. The ingredients are amazing and refreshing to know that there are no harsh chemicals. I also love that its not something that it&#x27;s not tested on animals. I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles yet, but I do have kids who I&#x27;m sure will get me there faster! I do have dark circles and bags under my eyes from long nights and long days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•The first day- I felt tingling and it seem to brighten up my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•The second day- The bags started to shrink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•The Third day- No more puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very surprised how fast acting this eye cream really works. It&#x27;s also guaranteed or you get your money back. It arrived in 2 days and was packaged very nice, neatly and just cute. The bubble wrap had several layers, someone actually took the time to wrap it really cute around the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;What an amazing product!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see much a difference while using this product. It did have a smell to it that I did not enjoy . Sorry.</li>
    <li> I was expecting better results by now.  I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> After applying Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream daily for 3 weeks, I can notice that the skin under my eyes look less dry. I can still see signs of my fine lines, and I seriously don’t think that any product I’ve tried will remove them completely. I really like that my eyes look less dark, I think this is a good sign that the cream is working. Also, a plus with any eye cream is that it’s a non-sticky formula, and absorbs quickly into the skin! I mentioned in another blog post that I have issues with puffiness under my eyes from lack of sleep. So, I love the cooling effect I experience after I apply Body Merry under my eyes. The skin under my eyes feel refreshed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one thing that I don’t like about Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream. I don’t like the scent! I think it smells too strong for an eye cream! I can smell lemon grass mixed with other natural fragrances. I think it’s too overpowering, and my husband agrees. I remember leaning over to kiss him and he asked what was I wearing so that’s not a good sign. I don’t want my eye cream smelling like I put on a horrible perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the ingredients in the Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream are working together to make the skin under my eyes look more refreshed, and brighten. I will continue to use Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream to see if it works to reduce my fine lines. I’m not sure if I would purchase Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream in the future I would consider only if the makers of Body Merry change the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was given Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream for reviewing purposes. However, the opinions expressed are 100% my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t been using too long so not sure about effectiveness yet.  However, if your skin is sensitive, do not use every day or night.  Use another eye cream on the off days/nights.</li>
    <li> Very nice cream. Absorbs quickly and not greasy.</li>
    <li> I used this eye cream for almost a month and within the first week I noticed a huge difference on my eyes. I usually have a huge problem with dark circles and puffy bags, so I was very excited to try this product out! I loved how lightly the cream felt on my skin. It didn’t feel oily at all! A little tiny bit went a long way, so you really get a huge bang for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this fights against skin aging, wrinkles and puffiness in your eyes, it already had me sold. The powerful ingredients included in this are Vitamins C, E, B5, Peptide Complex, Amino Acid Emulsification, Hyaluronic Acid, Retinol, Antioxidants, MSM and more. The organic ingredients include Aloe, Rose Hip Oil, Jojoba Oil, Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Cranberry Licorice, Sunflower Oil, Borage Oil, Flaxseed Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Lavender, Calendula, Chamomile, Witch Hazel, Cocoa Butter, Cucumber, Green Tea and many more…&lt;br /&gt;It truly amazes me how great this product was to try out. You can just tell a lot of care went into making this product because there are absolutely NO harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> Wonderful eye cream. It smells very nice, even relaxing. Goes on really light. Have been using for a few weeks, &amp; I see a difference in the dark circles, puffiness and lines. Non irritating even on eyelids. Tap pump lightly or too much comes out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on the reviews. I don&#x27;t have any allergies or sensitive skin. I used it as directed and yet it has not done anything for me but make my under eyes itchy and very dry. The pump bottle is nice and the smell is nice and all but it didnt do what it supposed to do for me. UPDATE: The customer service is amazing, they gave me a full refund without questions or returning the bottle. For that I am adding couple stars more!</li>
    <li> So I got this in and automatically gave It to my partner who is a truck driver and she is on the road getting little sleep at a time never 8 hours in a row so she gets puffy eyes and dark circles.  She gets like two 4 hour nap sessions in her 10 hr break.  She has been trying this for a little more than a week and I have absolutely noticed the change.  She might still only get her naps as she says but her eye areas say she is getting great rest and no stress.  She looks years younger already.  Thank you&lt;br /&gt;I was asked for an honest and unbiased opinion.  That&#x27;s what you got here.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long but I can see a difference in the puffiness around my eyes!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite product from Body Merry. This one comes in a plastic pump top. Its easy to dispense and after applying to the eye area it leaves your skin feeling fresh. Contains Aloe which is one of my favorite plants. But as I looked over the long list of ingredients expecting to read chemicals it actually lists a wonderful list of natural ingredients. From Organic Coconut Oil, Cocoa Butter to Organic Licorice and Blueberry Extract this Cream has everything. Seriously. I knew using this that I liked the way my skin felt and the dark circles under my eyes were not nearly as bad.  This cream also has matrixyl 3000 &amp; tripeptide5, ocean based retinol, botanic hyaluronic acid, organic vitamins &amp; minerals, and pure plant oils. The long list of natural ingredients leaves this cream smelling really good (blueberry extract!?) . I wish I could use this on my entire face, ok I confess I did!  The pump top contains 1oz of Age Defense Eye Cream. Its my new favorite Eye Cream everyone. Its awesome. While I did receive a free sample all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works, no joke about it my dark circles are lighter. This is the stuff to buy! You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> I love this! It has such a cooling effect on my eyes. I use it almost every night and I can feel my skin getting taunt! I don&#x27;t ever wake up with dark circles or puffy eyes any more. Which was always my biggest priority. I love how this isn&#x27;t tested on animals and I love this company. I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
    <li> just received a day ago. I don&#x27;t have much to say as of yet, since I have to give myself more time to see true result of using this eye cream. I can say it arrive in a timely manner, which I like and the packing was good. Also I like the consistency of cream, it goes on really nice and smooth and absorbed into the skin nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update over two months:&lt;br /&gt;This is a great eye cream compared to one&#x27;s I used in past. First I&#x27;m 34 yrs old,  I never have wrinkle but my eyes looked so youthful and awakened... I absolutely like this cream and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Between picking exercising back up and using this every morning and night, I have seen a huge change in my face. The wrinkles are not necessarily going away but my face is filling out to a healthier look. My wife and I have noticed a huge change in the dark circles under my eyes as well. The only con that I can see with this product is that the smell is strong and not exactly a mescaline smell(similar to baby powder maybe).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a little while, but i am starting to see improvements with my crows feet and under my eyes.</li>
    <li> It works!! It works!! It works!! Did you hear what I said?? It works!! This light and silky cream diminished my dark circles, made my wrinkles disappear, and made my puffiness go &amp;#34;poof!!&amp;#34; I was pleasantly surprised by the way this cream worked and actually did what it said it was going to!! If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me. I would be more then happy to answer them!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so hard to be objective when it comes to these types of products because as stated by others because results and needs are different. I think I have tried 3 different creams in the past, two over the counter, and one with the help of a physician.  For the price (I bought it on sale), it is worth the value.  It does reduce puffiness and wrinkles for me, but it does not do as much for the dark circles.  Sadly I believe my dark circles are more genetic than anything else.  It is not a miracle worker, but it has improved my condition.  It also has a pleasant smell, I can&#x27;t describe it, but it is not odorless.&lt;br /&gt;If the sale price continues I would recommend others give it a try as well, it&#x27;s certainly as good as anything else I have seen out there.</li>
    <li> Boy did I need this. Love it!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Smells so good, feels so moisturizing ... I&#x27;m really glad I found and purchased this eye cream!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It s amazing how after just two weeks of usage I can notice a big difference in the skin around my eyes, dark circles are almost gone (after working overnight for 2 years they started to appear because of the lock of a good sleep) I will surely reorder in the future.</li>
    <li> Product did not work for me.</li>
    <li> so far, no change in my  eye bags, I intend to continue to use, because the eye cream is not allergic. So after this bottle use all finished, I&#x27;ll comment.</li>
    <li> Very effective in lightening dark circles under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this eye cream for around six weeks before I posted a review. I am very happy with this product! I&#x27;ve used everything from low cost drug store brands to very expensive brands costing over $100. I&#x27;m 42 and have two small children who wear me out and don&#x27;t let me sleep much so I&#x27;ve developed dark circles. This eye cream addresses all of my needs! It has significantly reduced my small wrinkles and gets rid of the dark circles. I may be exhausted but at least I don&#x27;t look tired! The price is great and I love all the natural ingredients. I can actually pronounce all the ingredients and know what they are.  I&#x27;ll definitely keep buying this eye cream because it works great!</li>
    <li> I was hoping it would reduce puffiness and dark circles under the eye.  It didn&#x27;t seems to change the darkness, but the puffiness did diminish nicely.  It goes on smoothly, absorbs nicely, and I like the scent (lemony?).  I&#x27;m impressed with Body Merry customer service.  They follow up on purchase after a while, and quickly refund your money if you aren&#x27;t completely satisfied... as well as recommend other products that may help.  They have even offered me a free sample of one of their products once.  --Amanda</li>
    <li> If anything my eyes looked worse after using product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always searching for good eye creams for my sensitive skin. This is the first eye cream I tired at Amazon based on its high reviews. So I&#x27;m willing to give it a try. I apply it on whole my eye area and the forehead. So far I love the cool feeling it brings to me and I feel my eye area get hydrated (hope this can stop the wrinkles). Will keep using it and see if it can reduce my dark circles later. Good product!</li>
    <li> I have tried multiple eye creams because I get bags under my eyes sometimes, and this is by FAR my favorite!! It really moisturizes, gets rid of bags, and leaves me looking fresh and wide awake! It has a cooling feel to it too. With other products I&#x27;ve used, if I forget to put some on my eyes feel really dry, but that doesn&#x27;t happen wit this product. I will continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> I like it so far.. It does seem to soften the fine lines around my eyes. I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed a lift on my eyelids, but I have been only using about a week now. I will continue to use until the bottle is empty and update my reveiw then. There is a very distict smell with this cream, that some people may really dislike. I have gotten used to it as I have been using it everyday.</li>
    <li> I have tried many eye creams and I really do like this one. I have noticed when I put it on the lines around my eyes seem to diminish. It goes on smooth and penetrates well so when I put on my concealer, it goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> I have tried a variety of eye creams since I don&#x27;t always get as much sleep as I should be getting, resulting in dark shadowy areas under my eyes, and some times deep bags. Not always, but sometimes they&#x27;re so puffy and dark that I look like I should be on the set of The Walking Dead. I&#x27;m kidding....&lt;br /&gt;But anyway,&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product under my eyes and the first thing that I noticed is that is feels very cooling under my tired eyes. I thought of putting it in the fridge like I&#x27;ve heard that some people do, but I&#x27;m afraid I might ruin the product with the temperature change. I honestly don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;The cool sensation that I get after applying is always welcome when I wake up in the morning. It&#x27;s a tiny pick me up. It&#x27;s not too greasy nor is it sticky. You only need to use a VERY tiny bit or then it can get a little messy and you definitely don&#x27;t want to get this product in your eyes. It might sting a little if this happens.&lt;br /&gt;Nice sized bottle, nice pump top for easy application.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I like this product because of how it feels, but does it actually work?&lt;br /&gt;After using for a little while now, I still notice the bags, but they don&#x27;t look as dark. Also, they&#x27;re still a little puffy but not as much as before. Those are both two very good things. I don&#x27;t really how deep wrinkles or crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes so I honestly cannot say whether or not the product is effective for that.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I just think that this product is probably great for those of you who have slight darkness or bags or just need to &amp;#34;wake up your eye area&amp;#34; a bit. It was not a miracle cream for me, but I doubt anything will be if I keep getting such little sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a free bottle from Body Merry for reviewing purposes. All opinions expressed are solely my own.</li>
    <li> I was recently asked to try and review Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream and I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;My eyes always seem to look tired with dark circles underneath. It started lightning within the first day. Around my eyes are hydrated without making things too oily. I noticed that my eyes look a lot brighter and less tired.&lt;br /&gt;I am very please with this product and can’t wait to try more products from this company.</li>
    <li> Received this product at a great discount for reviewing purposes. So far i have been indeed impressed with the eye cream. Have been using for approximately 9 days and i must say i do believe its working. I can feel the skin around my eye areas getting softer and tighter. The cream has a very nice scent and does not at all leave my skin greasy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the dark circles that I have had under my eyes my whole life.  But if you&#x27;re a guy, you aren&#x27;t going to like the smell.  It is VERY perfumy, and smells like the cheapy drugstore perfume that your grandmother used to buy.  Very disappointing.  I know there are probably women that may like the smell, but hopefully it works well enough that they can overlook that.  A neutral scent would have been a much better choice for the manufacturer.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a short time and don&#x27;t think I will be able to try it long enough to even see if it works.</li>
    <li> I have only used this eye cream for a few days and am in love with it.  It goes on without being greasy, does not smear my mascara and does not burn my eyes.  I have tried many different eye products and thought I was destined to not find perfection.  I will surely order again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really nice cream, and I love that it&#x27;s paraben free. My only issue is that it&#x27;s difficult to press the pump lightly enough in order to dispense the correct amount. Some of it is wasted and I have to use it elsewhere on my face. I haven&#x27;t noticed a lightening of dark circles, but the consistency is nice. Otherwise, I have been happy with the product!</li>
    <li> I love this product (and believe me I have used many)!  It&#x27;s soft and creamy but not greasy at all.  I love how it makes my skin feel.  I wear it under make up and then apply before bedtime and truly do see a difference in the fine lines.  I&#x27;m a believer and I will buy again.  It arrived fast as well (added bonus).</li>
    <li> I have been using Body Merry for several weeks and have noticed that my fine lines are visibly reduced. You only need a small amount to cover your face so the bottle will last for a while. My face feels soft and it leaves a nice subtle glow to my face without being heavy and sticky. Body Merry is also gentle on your skin. It did not cause burning or breakouts to my face.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance...I hope it works!</li>
    <li> Update: I have been using this for a month, twice a day.  No change on the puffiness under my eyes so far...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to help reduce puffiness under my eyes, but it has not done much for that  yet.  But I see less lines right after I put  it on, so I think I just have to keep using it.  I really hope this can reduce puffiness.  It has only been 1 week since I started using it, so I will see.</li>
    <li> I love a good eye cream so I was happy to try Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream. It is loaded with antioxidants, organic vitamins and minerals, plant oils, witch hazel, lemongrass, beeswax, flax seed oil, jojoba oil, just to name a few. It has active botanicals such as healing and soothing aloe. It is very light weight and left my eyes feeling hydrated. I do have sensitive skin but didn&#x27;t experience any irritation at all. I have been using this product for a couple weeks now. However, I have yet to see any long term benefits from it yet. I have seen any lightening in my dark circles or my fine lines yet. It has really great rating on Amazon so maybe it just needs a little more time to work its magic. Plus they offer a 90day satisfaction guarantee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate is as \\&quot;helpful\\&quot; and or leave a comment. I enjoy writing reviews and hearing feedback about what I have written as I feel reviews help those interested make an informed decision before purchasing. I also feel that honest and informative reviews improve a product by providing insight to the company.</li>
    <li> I like this has natural and organic components. I like it is a lightweight formula and is a gentle and effective solution. This works great for dark circles, wrinkles and puffiness. Also it is Made in USA and is not tested on animals. This is backed with a 90 day 100% Satisfaction Guarantee.</li>
    <li> Are you tired of trying all these eye creams that leave you feeling sticky and aren’t covered well by your makeup? I’m right there with you. If you’re looking to use eye cream that means you must already be dealing with puffy under eyes, wrinkles, dark circles, or just plain tired looking eyes. Don’t let your eye cream work against you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream works for you as a lightweight formula and solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your eyes are one of the most delicate areas of your body; it’s not the ideal place to put harsh chemicals that cause itching, burning, or worse! Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream is packed full of 70+ ingredients that includes many natural and organic components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> I received the item by expected delivery date. I was like a kid opening a toy for the first time. I applied a few dabs around my eyes and I was impressed. I use it in my morning and night routine. The cream is lightweight. I have sensitive skin and this product has proven to me how great it is. The smell of the  eye cream is wonderful! I recommend this product to anyone that needs something that WORKS and anyone with dark circles! Will definitely purchase again after running out!</li>
    <li> Finally, an eye cream to get rid of those pesky dark spots around my eyes. This stuff is was better than putting cucumbers over your eyes, however it does contain cucumber! It also contain a entire host of natural and organic components such as  Aloe, Rose Hip Oil, Jojoba Oil, Coconut Oil, Beeswax, Cranberry, Licorice, Sunflower Oil, Chamomile, Witch Hazel, Cocoa Butter and Green Tea  just to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;After using it faithfully day and night I am getting amazing results. There are so many wonderful vitamins and peptides in the cream that dark spots and wrinkles don&#x27;t have a fighting chance! I&#x27;ll let you be the judge when you see my before and after pics. I did receive this amazing eye cream complimentary in exchange I would test it and post my results here in this review. I am happy to report that this stuff is the real deal!</li>
    <li> love this product, awesome</li>
    <li> Love this product as it uses natural ingredients instead of harsh chemicals</li>
    <li> I am always looking for a good eyecream! With little children I have my fair share of sleepless nights and dark circles. As I really don&#x27;t have wrinkles I can&#x27;t attest to its ability to remove them! However I have seen my Dark circles begin to fade away! This has allowed me to use less concealer to cover them! It&#x27;s also refreshing when applied! An old school top I use is I keep it in the fridge! This held reduce puffiness and the overall experience is quite calming! I use it 2 times a day with my normal skin care routine! Being consistsnt helps! The only downer is the scent! While it&#x27;s not a very hard smell I have sensitive nose and allergies so the little scent it has bothers me. After a few minutes it fades away! i am actually almost finished the bottle! Time to order more!!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this eye cream for a few days but I can tell a huge difference in the dark bags under my eyes. I can&#x27;t wait to see what the difference is after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> thus far every satisfied with your product.</li>
    <li> On my second bottle. Appears to be softening lines and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all. This is tons better than the more expensive eye creams I have used and this is saying a lot since I am a product junkie.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works well and is smooth and pleasant smell also.</li>
    <li> I have just reorder this product. This is not an instant fix. You need to allow time for results</li>
    <li> love the cream been using it for a few days and my face feels great , under eyes are brighter and tighter</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. My eyes look less dark and more well rested.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is for puffiness,wrinkles and dark circles.  The first time I attempted to apply the product the pump just kept on pumping. No stopper and it was very difficult to stop. I used it in the evening before bed and the next morning when I got up I had swelling on my lids and upper cheeks just below the eye..  I love bought OMG! What did I get into?.  My husband reminded me of my new products and I ran to check the ingredients bags in. All good quality natural products so why would this happen?  I attempted to use the cream for two more nights and still woke with swelling and puffiness.  Apparently one of the ingredients and I don&#x27;t agree. I had to stop using the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product now for a few months and have noticed slight improvement around my eyes and less dark circles.  Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> No one wants Dark circles under their eyes.  Here&#x27;s a product to help with that.</li>
    <li> The packaging is not impressive and I was a little skeptical when the moisturizer came out a little slick looking. However it dried very quickly and felt very nice. Moisturized without feeling heavy. Very surprised and definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Just arrived yesterday, so tried it last night. I love it! Would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Just started this I will be back to write a better review when I see results!</li>
    <li> This product i got for free to review here and i got to say this did work for a while. It had a nice texture to it and the smell was one of a kind. I did feel like it did take of the dark circle i have had but not all completely. The bad thing about it is that it is a small size bottle. but overall it was a nice product.</li>
    <li> Like this eye cream a lot. Super light and non-greasy and feels soothing. Sometimes it&#x27;s not quite enough moisture for night time but I love it during the day!</li>
    <li> Great product! Love it!!</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream, while I have not seen instant results- I didn&#x27;t expect to.  My skin feels smoother and softer yet firm and hydrated. I would recommend this product on the pure fact it is making my skin healthy looking and ut shows.  Definitely would recommend</li>
    <li> Okay, but didn&#x27;t​ make me any younger...BUMMER!</li>
    <li> Yes, this cream has an unnecessary menthol scent which I don&#x27;t want near my eyes. So as not to waste it, I&#x27;ve started using the cream on the backs of my hands. If that has a positive effect, I&#x27;ll revise my rating. The bottle is a good design that will keep the product fresh: you twist to open it and you can control the amount with a light touch on the pump top.</li>
    <li> Nice cream with a nice consistency. Will buy again, girlfriend very happy.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid fifties and I&#x27;ve experienced a lifetime of sunning, laughter and living and I have the deep smile lines to prove it! In addition, I do not have a thyroid and must take a thyroid replacement. Many out there know first hand what a thyroid condition does to the skin! Let&#x27;s add menopause to that and it might be considered a 9-1-1 skincare emergency!  This summer I decided to get serious about my skincare routine. In the past, I used the &amp;#34;big manufacturers&amp;#34; products and frequently they made their way into the trash as I suffered from allergic reactions, red, watery eyes, runny nose, etc. Many times, I gave up and tried to simply manage my skin issues. I am not a Botox person and I have always been intimidated by the cosmetic counters found in department stores. I knew I needed to take care of the aging so I began the search for quality, organic skincare products and I found this amazing company and product. I have used this product faithfully for one month. From the first time using the product, I was pleased. The cream is lightweight and does not leave a greasy feeling. It is the perfect weight for the eye area and the scent is absolutely delightful! I see a distinct difference and a marked softening of my &amp;#34;smile&amp;#34; lines. I have not experienced any allergic reaction and I can even use it in the morning before applying my make up without the worry of my makeup running down my face. I am excited to see the results after several months. The customer service is outstanding. The company emailed directions for use and a reminder of their money back guarantee. They followed up several weeks later for my feedback. It felt like the old school Nordstrom service from my youth! I consider them a &amp;#34;boutique&amp;#34; for organic skincare. I look forward to trying their other products. Big thanks to Amazon for supporting small companies, organic products and carrying this line and thanks to Body Merry!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very impressed as far as puffiness is concerned.  Also, it isn&#x27;t the best&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  It goes on so smoothly, and feels wonderful.  I&#x27;ve been trying different products for years and years.  I&#x27;m seventy-eight years old, and fortunately for me, I try to keep my skin as young as possible, and it shows.  As we get older, it&#x27;s hard for any product to completely get rid of those age old lines, but I must say this eye cream has done wonders.  I get complimented all the time about how great my skin looks.  Your neck cream is wonderful too!  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Absolutley love this eye cream definatley working for my crows feet thanks so much for a great product ! I recieved this product through a promo code to give it a try and certainly do not regret it wil be buying this again when I run out for sure thanks so much for a great product..</li>
    <li> I have dark circles, ive already noticed the circles under my eyes are lighter. What a great product ty</li>
    <li> It seems to be working.!!</li>
    <li> very good product at a good price</li>
    <li> This cream is great! It works and I love the smell. It does have a strong smell but it reminds me of sunflowers a little.</li>
    <li> Really love this product.  Makes my skin around my eyes firmer already and have only been using for 2 weeks !</li>
    <li> First one actually works in this price range</li>
    <li> It seems nice, but not for me. It is too oily and has an off putting scent. It also makes the skin around my eyes very tender feeling.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working well. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is definitely a good value! It&#x27;s hard to tell if any wrinkle cream is working, but I do think that my eyes look brighter and the under eye area is firmer. A little goes a long way and I do like that it&#x27;s not a super thick or heavy cream. Will be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Great product. I love the refreshing feeling when I appy it.</li>
    <li> Works great!  My eyes have not looked this good in years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the moisturizer, eye cream and serum for just two weeks and my skin is already thanking me.  I am 42 years old and suffer from dry, itchy skin.  My skin feels tighter, softer, and perfectly hydrated.  The dark circles under my eyes are less prominent.  I am able to go without makeup once again.  You can&#x27;t beat the price or the results.</li>
    <li> This cream makes my skin feel soft not greasy.  It is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve got layers on.  My dark circles have started lightening up a little too.  I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I had to return this item.  The smell was so strong - I couldn&#x27;t use it. I don&#x27;t know if it works or not.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like strong scented products, don&#x27;t purchase this.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky, it rubs in very nicely and doesn&#x27;t sting or burn. It does a very good job of reducing dark circles from under the eyes. It also wear nicely under makeup. The only negative I have about this product is the unappealing smell it has, it is tolerable though because the smell does dissipate with time.</li>
    <li> I chose this eye cream for dark circles...they are the family gift that gets passed diwn through the generations. There&#x27;s not a lot of products on the market that target circles. Most tackle wrinkles and lines. I find this product to be better than most that I&#x27;ve tried--and I&#x27;ve tried a lot. I feel that my eyes are less puffy and tighter. I do not see a dramatic change in the coloration below my eyes. I like that the product uses natural ingredients in its formula. That us important to me.</li>
    <li> Mine doesn&#x27;t look like this bottle. But I do like it. It hydrates well and smells great. I still have wrinkles but I also have realistic expectations. So there&#x27;s that.</li>
    <li> did absolutely nothing. Didn&#x27;t see any change</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a month now and the results have been outstanding.  Very good, Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I use this cream every night before bed.  It smells nice, it soaks in well, and makes my skin nice and smooth.  I still have faint circles but overall its a lovely product.</li>
    <li> So far so good. It appears to be the best eye cream I have used. It wears nicely under makeup and smooth&#x27;s fine lines. I am looking forward to seeing more positive results the longer I use it.</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect! Thank you!</li>
    <li> You can barely tell I have a newborn my circles are gone!</li>
    <li> Great quality for a good price</li>
    <li> Did help with my puffy eyelids.</li>
    <li> This seems to help puffiness, but not redness under eyes.</li>
    <li> as per your guarantee I would appreciate my money returned as this product did not make any difference in the appearance of my eyes.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product. Saw the effect in a week itself.</li>
    <li> Never use this product be careful, I got very dark circles under my eyes more than before when I use this cream. I am right now searching for something can fix the damaged what this cream did in my skin</li>
    <li> I really have fallen in love with skincare over the past six months.  Up until about a year or so ago, I was fortunate and my age hadn&#x27;t &amp;#34;Caught up&amp;#34; to me quite yet....  Then somewhere in my thirties, the inevitable happened.  I started noticing a loss of elasticity as well as what I call &amp;#34;balloon lids&amp;#34; and thought my skin would never be the same..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then about six months ago, I started to take care of my skin and started using a regular skincare regimen...  Since then I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin looks better!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this eye cream!  I have noticed a MAJOR decrease in the dark circles that have plagued me my WHOLE life and my eyelids seem to have tightened up some!  I also have noticed a decrease in the &amp;#34;fine lines&amp;#34; that I once had.  Overall, I can tell a huge difference.  if you are using a complete skincare system then this definitely will increase your chances of producing some fabulous results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***  Please note:  I was given this product for testing / review purposes.  However, the thoughts and opinions expressed here are my own.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have had dark circles under my eyes for years, and no other products have delivered on their promise to remove or relieve them.  After using this eye cream almost dailty for one month I do notice less puffiness and lighter coloration under my eyes!  I am so glad that I finally came across this!  The instructions recommend using it twice daily, but most times I am applying the cream only once a day under and around my eyes.  The change is noticeable.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I like the cream.  It feels nice on the eyes.  I have been using it faithfully twice a day, since I received it.  My main eye issues are dark circles, dryness and fine lines on inner upper eyelid area.  The cream seems to be addressing the first two issues pretty well.  I am not sure if with continual use I will see an improvement on the upper lid.  But I do like the cream and I like the smell too</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful cream. It glides on smoothly, so that little pea-sized amount that they recommend will actually be enough for both eyes. (This is not always the case in my experience.) It is very lightly scented, and it feels silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I have extremely sensitive eyes, and I&#x27;m not able to use it. FTR, many, many facial care products bother my eyes, so I&#x27;d say this should not be an issue for most people. Body Merry stands behind their guarantee of offering hassle-free refunds, and communication with the company has been pleasant. I would happily recommend them to others.</li>
    <li> Love the light scent. Under eye bags seemed diminished after first use without burning sensation of other products</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had amazing results after just one use, which is possibly one of the corniest things I&#x27;ve ever said.... but this eye cream completely eliminated the visibility of the fine lines under my eyes on the first application. I have regularly used and tried all types of beauty products to try to combat aging and I have never had anything provide such viable results with the first use. My skin is obviously going to age, but I want to be able to have my skin as healthy as possible and maybe even look younger than I am. I don&#x27;t ever expect miracles out of skin products, so it is a rare occasion when I&#x27;m really impressed with something. I don&#x27;t have crow&#x27;s feet, but I have high hopes that this eye cream will help fend them off when the time comes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love so much about this product that it is hard to find a place to begin.&lt;br /&gt;The pump bottle is really easy to use without getting too much or too little of the product. The simple label/packaging and the satisfaction guarentee shows that the eye cream can stand on its own merit without needing any gimicks or flashy graphics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light scent that isn&#x27;t really pleasant or unpleasant. Its not a scent that I would wear as a fragrance, but it also isn&#x27;t a scent that would make me avoid using the product. Its hard to explain, but it doesn&#x27;t smell BAD. The cream isn&#x27;t greasy or oily and it absorbs quickly. The ingredients are absolutely amazing! When they say &amp;#34;70+ power packed ingredients&amp;#34;, they&#x27;re NOT kidding. This eye cream has over half of the beneficial skin ingredients that I can think of. It has reduced my fine lines, helped with puffiness and dark circles, firmed my eye area, and it&#x27;s given my eye area a healthier look and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
    <li> The eye cream is very light and easy to apply. This cream really helps to reduce the circles under eyes. It smells like cucumber. It has cucumber and it really helps me to improve the appearance of puffy eyes.  I feel my under eye skin refreshed when I apply the cream in the mornings. The cream isn&#x27;t greasy or oily and it absorbs quickly, you can apply your makeup and shadows perfectly. I also use the cream at night with my clean face. After using the cream for a couple of days I really noticed a difference.&lt;br /&gt;@MakeupByOne</li>
    <li> I was able to review this for free.&lt;br /&gt;The eye cream comes in a slim bottle with a pump style top. The cream reminds me of a cucumber melon scent and is light, creamy (no clumps or grit), non-oily. I have been applying it morning and night. Before use under my eyes felt a bit rough, un-firm and just plain dry. After the first use my under eyes were so soft and hydrated. With that being said it has slightly reduced the appearance of darkness under them. I&#x27;m excited to see how it will continue to improve the look of my under eyes and beauty lines. The Fact that the company offers a 90 day satisfaction guarantee tells me they stand behind there product and so do I. I recommend this product and even if you don&#x27;t like it as much as I do its always good to use with no harsh chemicals and again the 90 guarantee. More to write as I see more changes.</li>
    <li> My daughter is hooked on Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream.  I have been telling her she needs to start applying eye cream underneath her eyes.  She has been taking her youthful glow for granted and not properly caring for her beautiful skin.  She noticed an incredible difference underneath her eyes after using Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With 24 hours of using it she noticed a difference.  Initially she was applying it underneath her eyes, but when she discover her eyelids were getting a little dark, she began applying it on her eyelids as well.  The first couple of days after applying it at night, she would wake up with her eyes feeling sticky.  Now it does not happen.  Now her eyes pop above and below.  She is confident with not wearing making when leaving the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to using Body Merry, she would apply quit a bit of concealer underneath her eyes, now she does not use so much, when wearing make up.  She has been wanting a natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Berry Merry ahs packed in cutting edge peptides like Matrixyl-3000 and Tripeptide-5 with an ocean based Retinol and botanical Hyaluronic Acid. They know that&#x27;s not enough – so they&#x27;ve added lots of antioxidants, organic vitamins and minerals, pure plant oils and botanical actives – Aloe, Witch Hazel, Coconut Oil, Cocoa Butter, Vitamin C, Cucumber, Beeswax, Jojoba Oil, Tamanu Oil, Green Tea, Licorice, Eyebright, Avocado Oil, Flax Seed Oil, Rose Hip Oil, Lemon, Lemongrass, Vitamin B5, Lavender and Chamomile (to name just a few!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream works well on all skin types and leaves your skin looking and feeling firm, plump and young. My daughter is getting fast and lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I love that when I read the ingredient list I know what they all are, nothing scary in there! It smells really nice, vaguely like Sprite. It goes on very smooth, I like the pump top for easy usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure yet if it reduces any crows feet or other wrinkles but it did seem to reduce puffiness. I&#x27;m in my 20s and would mostly just like to start preventing signs of aging on my face, not reverse any.</li>
    <li> Thanks ..... A work in progress  we will see ..... I really appreciated the email from the company with detailed instructions and advice</li>
    <li> Application: I applied this light cream around my eye area both in the morning and evening. It had a hint of lavender smell, and it was a little slow to absorb. It was not sticky, and it was easy to apply make-up over. Use a gentle touch when dispensing or you might end up with too much product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: I felt like even in the short amount of time I used the product, I was starting to feel results, so I would definitely continue to use on an ongoing basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.</li>
    <li> I purchased this eye cream mainly to address dark circles under my eyes. I have some fine lines but deep wrinkles and puffiness are not issues I have to combat. So I cannot speak to this cream&#x27;s ability to address those issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for about 4 weeks and while I have not noticed a huge change, I have noticed that I am using much less concealer and face make-up. Honestly, it&#x27;s so hard to tell if creams work because they work gradually and I see my face every day. So I have to go off things like using less make-up. I hate my dark circles and they are generally the reason I feel compelled to wear make-up everyday, but the past few weeks I have felt comfortable going out without any face make-up to run errands and drop my kids off. I use it twice a day as recommended and you really don&#x27;t need to use a lot so I anticipate this bottle lasting me awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue using and will likely purchase again. They also have great customer service and communication!</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff is really nice!  I love the bottle.  It has such a nice pump and the cream itself comes out almost airy.  This lotion has a light minty maybe citrus type scent which reminds me of the ocean.  I followed the directions and applied the eye cream after the 2.5% Retinol Serum.  With my fingertip I gently massaged the cream around both of my always tired, slightly wrinkled eyes.  After using the cream for a couple of days I really noticed a difference.  My fine lines seemed, finer and the bags...Let&#x27;s just say someone else is carrying them now!  Honestly, a little really does go a long way.  I suggest when applying this product, you should really be carful when pushing down on the pump.  Don&#x27;t push all the way down as you really don&#x27;t need that much cream for the area around your eyes. Easy to add to your morning routine. Good overall value. Filled with botanical hyaluronic acid, organic vitamins, minerals and pure plant oils. Again, with Body Merry your getting a product that is made right here in the USA and not tested on animals</li>
    <li> Great eye cream!  I bought this for my Mother and she loves it!  It has helped with the fine lines and puffiness!  Recommended!!</li>
    <li> I happened to be allergic to something in the product. I can&#x27;t give it more stars since I couldn&#x27;t use it, but I can&#x27;t give it less because the company was so nice. They followed up with me and when I mentioned this, they gave me a full refund. I wasn&#x27;t going to complain until I spoke with a dermatologist (which I have and he shrugged and said it could be anything, I just have very sensitive skin), but they wrote me to check on the quality of their product. This is a company that cares that you are receiving a good product and customer service. I wish I didn&#x27;t have such sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have received this product a few days ago n have been using it since I noticed a different look with my eyes n I love it</li>
    <li> It, certainly, hydrates my skin around the eyes, reducing the appearance of wrinkles. I need something to reduce the puffiness under my eyes -it is just bags, no dark circles. I sleep 7-8 hours daily, but I start at midnight for I work second shift and drink more than enough water, with  healthy eating habits. I&#x27;ve been using the cream for about two weeks, twice a day and I am quite pleased, even though my problem is not dark circles; it&#x27;s helped the dryness around my eys. As I keep using it, I&#x27;ll be able to see the real work of the product and update the rate.</li>
    <li> Body Merry&#x27;s Age Defense Eye Cream is an awesome product that works wonders.  I have been using this product for a month now and have noticeable results.  I have been putting this cream around my whole eye area every morning after my shower and then again after I wash my face before I go to bed at night.  It is a very soft cream that does not leave a greasy residue.  The eye cream rubs into your skin very nicely and drys fast.  Awesome product!!!  The dark circles under my eyes have vanished as well as the puffiness.  Thanks Body Merry for making the best eye cream ever!  5 Stars!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best eye creams I have ever used!!  From the first use I felt it tighten my eye area and every day it improves my skin and occasional puffiness too!  There are so many natural ingredients in this product!!  It absorbs instantly.... I Love It love it!!</li>
    <li> I love this! Such a small amount goes a long way, and feels wonderful.. I had read reviews with complaints about the smell, but I&#x27;m kind of a hippie chick and when I smelled the lovely Tea tree scent, I was in love. Very calming scent. Fabulous stuff..</li>
    <li> Very happy.  Nice light cream, noticeable improvement.  I would recommend this product, plus the company&#x27;s follow up and customer care is second to none!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who has horrible dark circles and bags,I can honestly say it has done an amazing job on him! It&#x27;s light weight not greasy.</li>
    <li> The skin around my eyes used to get very dry.  This helps a lot and I noticed my eyes look a lot younger.</li>
    <li> I have very puffy eyes and forget to use it wtwice a day as suggested. However , it seems to be helping.Goes on well and no waste when pumed out!</li>
    <li> Use daily for under eye puffines it dose help.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream.  Its very light, with no greasy feeling.  It absorbs right in and doesn&#x27;t dry my eye area out.  And has a nice smell.  I am 41 and am trying to defy the age process for as long as I can.  I&#x27;m happy I found this product, which is quite reasonable and actually works.  I&#x27;ve noticed the fine laugh lines around my eyes have softened.  I have been using the product for a little over a month.  I&#x27;m sure I will continue to see results after another month of use.  Can&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Love love love the smell of this cream! My under-eye area does look briter too!!</li>
    <li> I am a product junkie and always looking for the best eye cream.  I would put this one at the top compared to even the $80 and $100 creams I&#x27;ve tried.  Fabulous for the price.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a huge improvement yet, but I&#x27;ve only had the product 3 weeks.  I do notice that my crows feet are a little less visible at the end of the day compared to how they used to look.  I would buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I did not buy this with a coupon. I read the reviews. It feels very wet first. Then it dries very nicely. I am soooo allergic to everything. My eyes will water if they get irritated. This cream does not irritate at all. I do recommend to everybody. Sometimes I put on all my face as well.</li>
    <li> I liked this product. It seemed to get the puffiness down on my under eye area.</li>
    <li> Body Merry is my new indulgence. I have almost purchased every product in the line.</li>
    <li> This eye cream works the beat for me.  I wish that it addressed lines and redness below the eye better but all in all the under eye area stays moist even in intense heat.  For that reason recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used many eye creams, and while this cream isn&#x27;t a miracle-worker, I am very pleased with the results.  The most significant result is the moisturizing effect in the area below my eyes.  I allow it to be absorbed for a few minutes and then apply concealer.  My concealer does not end up in the fine lines and creases and it seems to last all day.  In addition, because I apply it to my eyelids, I feel I have a better treatment in my entire eye area.  The price is very reasonable, so I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I have very dark circles and tend to get puffy easily. This has made a big improvement in both areas. I know I can never rid of the dark circles, but this sure has helped significantly. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a week but have been pleased. Has a present smell, absorbs quickly, moisturizes well &amp; acts as a good primer for eye makeup. Have not really seen a change in dark circles or fine lines but have appreciated the moisturization. Received this product for free to test how it works &amp; provide review - no compensation was provided.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for a couple of weeks so maybe results will improve with more time. I like what it does for my eyelids. It seems to plump them up. However, it has done nothing for the bags under my eyes. I&#x27;ll give it another week but if no improvement I&#x27;m going back to my old eye cream for the bags.</li>
    <li> I started using this product after receiving it free for a product review. This product is nice not overly greasy under my eye and I also have sensitive skin so I was afraid it would bother me but it really did not. Sometimes after I cry i get really puffy eyes for a day or two so thats when I like to use it since I am young I really do not have wrinkles or fine lines. The product is in a nice bottle great size and it dispense just enough product so no wasting.it. After using it for few days I noticed some puffiness going away which was great no one wants puffy eyes, eventually once my mom got wind of me having it she took it to use for herself but overall under my eyes have improved a lot.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I should put it on every day or not. I only sometimes have dark circles under my eyes. It feels nice putting it on and I like the small pump it comes with. I&#x27;m going to keep using it though and then maybe change my review.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.&lt;br /&gt;Let me first say that I an a 45 y.o. black woman who has hereditary dark circles around my eyes, so I don&#x27;t expect any product to cure that. However, the circles have gotten vexingly darker in recent years.&lt;br /&gt;With this product I was hoping to get some good, light hydration for the eye area. I was not even hoping to reduce the darkness around my eyes. However, this product has been an awakening to the world of eye cream - which I&#x27;ve never used before. The skin around my eyes tends to get quite dry - and the fine lines there more pronounced - in the cooler, dryer months. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a week and it has definitely helped with that. And the skin around my eyes just looks generally, brighter and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is very light and a little goes a long way. The scent is a little more pronounced than I would like, but it is still relatively light and fresh and not over-bearing at all. It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, and leaves no tacky feeling. It also appears to be a good primer for my eye make-up - I find at the end of the day that my eyeliner and shadow have not bled at all as they often do.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a free container of this product free to try and share my honest opinion. I received no compensation for reviewing the product.</li>
    <li> Hi there, I got the product as I was looking for help for my dark-under eyes, maybe the product is not helping me on that (I guess is genetic and It won&#x27;t let me) but I love the lotion it is refreshing on my eyes and I apply it on my upper lip too, It is very light and absorbs fast letting the skin smoother than any other product I ever used. Another great fact is the price, I will buy it again and again. I hope you try it.</li>
    <li> The Age Defense Eye Cream from Body merry arrived in a white and green box. The bottle inside is made of plastic and has a built-in pump for dispensing. The cream has a white color and has a minty/fresh scent. It has a creamy and smooth texture which absorbs quickly and goes on light and non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before applying any beauty product on my face, I always test it out on my hands first. This makes me sure that I wouldn&#x27;t have any allergic skin reaction to the product. I read the directions on how to use the Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream (again I always do this even I&#x27;ve tried similar products) to make sure I&#x27;m using it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use the Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream at night. I only need a small amount around my eyes so I only use half a pump of the cream. It has a cool effect on the skin around my eyes every time I apply it which is feels nice. It dries up and absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Body Merry&#x27;s Age Defense Eye Cream helps in preventing puffy eyes when I wake up. I&#x27;ve noticed less events of waking up to puffy eyes in the morning since I started using the Age Defense Eye Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have lines yet so I can&#x27;t comment on whether it works to improve crow&#x27;s feet and wrinkles around the eyes. I&#x27;m hoping the Body Merry&#x27;s Age Defense Eye Cream is able to help me prevent/delay the appearance of these lines. :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvement of my dark circles or wrinkles after weeks of using this product twice a day.  But I love the after sale service.  I gave it a try because the positive reviews, the descriptions and the inexpensive price.  Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I love how it makes my eyes look amazing. Even with little to no sleep.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male in my 40&#x27;s and my skin regiment consists of basically a facial cleaner in the shower, then a toner and moisturizer after drying off.  However, due to long hours and stress (kids in college, work, life, etc.) I began getting dark circles and bags under my eyes.  They really made me look much older and bothered me quite a bit and nothing I was doing seemed to have any impact on getting rid of, or even reducing, them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading lots of reviews, I purchased the Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream to see if it would help (I have never used this type of product before).  The product is dispensed using a pump, and even the slightest touch put a ton of product out onto my finger as I quickly learned.  I initially gently rubbed it below my eyes and was then reprimanded by my wife and taught to gently dab-dab-dab it on the skin under my eyes.  I immediately noticed a cool and tingly sensation (like something &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34;).  It absorbed quickly and cleanly into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about a month, twice a day (morning and night after I shower).  I use an extremely small amount per eye (see image attached showing a small drop on my finger with my hand and the bottle in the image).  My dark circles vanished within a few days, and the bags under my eyes were gone within 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works and the amount needed is so small, this container will last me forever.  I am extremely happy, and will continue using this product.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Very, very happy with this product!!&lt;br /&gt;Saw more smooth texture around my whole eye area within a few days.</li>
    <li> Product did not help with dark circles. In fact, in caused some acne to form beneath my eye occasionally. Tried it for 60 days and then stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> i purchased this a few weeks ago along with the super c-22 moisturizer. i used both products on a daily basis and i&#x27;m more than pleased with both. this product helped with my darkish area around my eyes from my on the go schedule and lack of sleep. it also helps greatly with those fine lines that happen in early 40&amp;#34;s. the proof in the pudding for me was after using in for 2 weeks straight, and going out on a saturday night and after getting overwhelming compliments on how i looked. &amp;#34;your face is glowing&amp;#34; &amp;#34;what the hell have you been doing, you look great!&amp;#34;.. it works as described folks, it works!</li>
    <li> Feels very fresh and soft and has a natural scent.&lt;br /&gt;I will get it again.</li>
    <li> this is a great product for puffy eyes and dark circles, i&#x27;ve used it only once a day and i find it works well and I can definitely see results. I have used this product for a week now, so i beleive  the dark circles will get better in time. The puffiness under the eyes great job. This product arrived on time and was exactly as advertised.  I will purchase another bottle if needed.</li>
    <li> not know the function yet, not sure it works for I just use it for a short time. but feeling good after put it around eyes. having a special smell, somebody might not like it, to me, just feeling a natural plant smell.</li>
    <li> Light creamy feel without being heavy. It also has a nice fragrance, very spa like.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it to get its full effect, bit I have noticed improvement in my eye area.</li>
    <li> Only have used it for a week or so, so still not sure about how well it works.  I do have to say that I really don&#x27;t like the smell. Not sure what it is, but it&#x27;s not a clean, refreshing scent.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of eye cream or serum companies who want to sell you their products. Hopefully they all have good intentions of making a woman feel, and look, a bit younger if she is over a certain age. This eye cream is white and has a semi minty scent, to me at least. I like it and when I gently dab it under my eyes it takes maybe 1 minute to dry. For me, this is great because the last thing I want to do is be waiting forever for a facial product to dry before applying my daily &#x27;war paint&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from this eye cream drying quickly, I like the ingredients. If you are a fan of all things natural or organic, this is an eye cream product you will want to purchase and use at least two times a day like I do.  Not only does this eye cream erase those dark circles, puffiness and wrinkles, it is made with such ingredients as Retinol, Hyaluronic Acid, Cucumber, Rosehip Oil, MSM, Aloe and a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye cream is great for women and men and if you want to buy as many products in the United States of America, then you have to buy this Age Defense Eye Cream by Body Merry. This eye cream is also NOT tested on animals, which should be a plus for all animal lovers.</li>
    <li> Love this for puffiness in the morning!</li>
    <li> As a blogger, I often keep fairly late hours to meet deadlines (ahh, the life of a journalist!). That can mean bags and dark circles under my eyes the next morning. My answer to all these little problems is Age Defense Eye Cream from Body Merry. I’m not saying it works miracles. I will say that I have pretty sensitive skin, and this cream doesn’t burn, or make my eyes water, like a lot of this type of moisturizer does. And, it seems to be helping by at least keeping the lines I have from getting worse.&lt;br /&gt;I was given free product to facilitate this review but all opinions are my own!</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream.  It is diminishing the dark circles and really moisturizing the eye area.  This is the first eye cream I have purchased that contains a full ounce rather than the usual 1/2 ounce.  You only use a little so this should last for some time.  What a great find!</li>
    <li> I decided to try this bases on other positive reviews. So far I have seem little change in my fine line wrinkles, but, hopefully that will change over a long term use. My reason for 4 stars is the smell. Goodness, it&#x27;s a very potent medicinal smell. And.....it takes forever to go away. Given its in the eye area, you really don&#x27;t want to get near anyone it&#x27;s that strong. Unless it truly works well, won&#x27;t buy again because of the smell</li>
    <li> Nice stuff.  Pleasant smell.  Non-oily.  Seems to work just fine but I&#x27;ve only been using it for three weeks or so.</li>
    <li> Great eye cream. Been using it for a few weeks now and can definitely tell a difference in the tiny wrinkles I had around my eyes. Goes on great, only need a tiny amount for both eyes. I let it sit a couple minutes before I put on my make up and it&#x27;s perfectly fine. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does nothing for my puffiness under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for about a month but I really love it. I love that a little bit goes a long way and that it comes in a pump container. I always hate digging into eye cream jars and getting it under my nails, ick. Anyway, it seems to have helped the color under my eyes a bit, too. Its great stuff, I highly recommend! Great price too! The only thing I dont like is the smell. Its kind of a strong herbal smell. Not a bad smell, just a bit strong. It doesn&#x27;t last so I still love this stuff. As soon as it is smoothed on and my makeup applied, I dont smell it anymore.</li>
    <li> I decided to use this product to help alleviate some of the dark circles that I have under my eyes.I ordered this product from Amazon and it arrived at my house within a couple of days. It comes in a blue/green and white bottle and is 1 fl oz. The product is a light white cream that is to be applied under the eyes and under makeup. It has a soft/light pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for a couple of weeks each night before going to bed and I have to say that it does work. I have seen a vast improvement in the appearance of my eyes. My eyes look and feel nice and rested and the dark circles are no longer prevalent. A little of this product definitely goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this to anyone looking for a nice product that can help alleviate fine lines and wrinkles under the eyes.</li>
    <li> This is the first eye cream I have used that does not irritate my eyes! I love that it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, and I am definitely seeing improvement in the puffy under eye part. Hoping that after a few more weeks of use it will take care of the wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I am testing this product for 45 days now and I love it I can notice good results. I was looking for an eye cream to reduce the dark circles around my eyes and it works. I apply it twice a day and massage lightly.</li>
    <li> It is a nice eye cream.  I would probably purchase it again.</li>
    <li> My skin was to sensitive, so I couldn&#x27;t use all of it.</li>
    <li> I love the results, great product BUT I hate the smell. It last till I put on my makeup then the smell finally goes away... That is the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5......</li>
    <li> Not that aware of difference</li>
    <li> Really works on wrinkles and dark circles!!!  Highly effective eye cream.  Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> This product has reduced the puffiness around my eyes and has tightened up my skin! Yay - love this cream!</li>
    <li> Nice product. Seems to be getting rid of sags and small wrinkles. Eyes look better and feel more refreshed.</li>
    <li> This is the second product I have tried by this company.  First the product is natural.  This eye cream is silky, not thick or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin feel very good.</li>
    <li> I need time to let you know regarding the results in my eyes,, I really feel that is a very good quality, because i feel my eyes a little smooth and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I just love this eye cream! It very creamy &amp; lightweight. I have trouble with allergies &amp; get puffy eyes &amp; this cream really seems to help!</li>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t see much difference after two months of dedicated use.  I probably will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This cream goes on smoothly and has an appealing scent.  It felt a little tingly the first few times I used it. Can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen drastic changes, but definitnely some suttle ones...less darkness and puffiness.</li>
    <li> I was having a lot of problems with my under-eyes drying out, wrinkling, and looking tissue-papery. I can honestly say I had positive results immediately after starting to use this eye cream. I use it at night and in the morning under makeup. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I found a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; eye cream. The smell is a little strong and at first I was a little scared to put it around my eyes. But, it is very gentle and works for the puffiness. As for the diminushing of wrinkles, I would have to ay that his cream is very hydrating so it should help to decrease the appeareance of the wrinkles, crow feets. The texture of the cream is just perfect nd it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to use morning and night. It&#x27;s not greasy so you can wear your make up without any problem after the use of the cream. As many other women, I&#x27;m aware of what chemicals make to the body and I&#x27;m glad I found this product. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love it so far. Highly recommend it after 3 days I don&#x27;t see the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
    <li> wow love this product only used it twice and the puffiness under my eyes are almost gone ive used alot of eye creams but can say honestly the results are amazing  this ones a keeper</li>
    <li> Very nice indeed!  I was provided this product to test for men.  I have bad allergies and as a result it causes dreaded dark circles under my eyes and puffiness.  Guess what?  It really worked!  Im not big on using lotions and cream and what have you, but I got to say that I was very surprised to say the least how using this help.  It feels nice, doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes, no real scent to speak of which I appreciate.  Guys!  Buy!</li>
    <li> Hi, I am 56yrs LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> Another great product from Body Merry.  Eye puffiness goes away immediately after application.</li>
    <li> Terrific little eye cream.  Lightweight &amp; does the good work eye cream should.  Excellent value &amp; I will definitely purchase again. Will certainly look to this company for other products.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE this eye cream it provides great moisture to the eye area softening my crows feet.....smells great too!  Khushboo was amazing at checking back with me to see how the product was working for me and I really  appreciate that.  I will continue to use this eye cream.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way!  I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in the way the skin around my eyes LOOKS, but it definitely FEELS much softer.  I&#x27;ve only been using the product for about two weeks though, so I&#x27;m hoping to notice more of a change down the road.  I don&#x27;t love the smell, but it wouldn&#x27;t stop me from using this product.</li>
    <li> Too many chemicals for my body.</li>
    <li> Why is this picture and the product different? I received it green</li>
    <li> love this product. Been using it for a few weeks and my dark circles have lightened considerably, my eyes seem brighter and more youthful and even my eyelashes seem longer. I am a pretty harsh critic, but I have nothing bad to say about this. Will definitely keep it a part of my daily routine.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different eye creams and serums searching for one that actually works to diminish the appearance of the dark circles under my eyes.  While this product doesn&#x27;t quite meet those wants, it has helped with the puffiness that I also have.  I use this morning and night after washing my face and it doesn&#x27;t take much at all (too much cream and it doesn&#x27;t absorb nicely) to give good coverage around my eyes.  I&#x27;m sure (as expected with products such as this), others have had and will have different results.  While still battling the dark circles, I&#x27;m very happy with no longer having puffy bags and would recommend this product with the note that everyone is different and while it works for one, it may not work for another.  I have a pile of nearly 10 eye creams that didn&#x27;t do a thing for me to attest to that statement.  I&#x27;m happy I did try this - I nearly didn&#x27;t after reading a few of the one star reviews.</li>
    <li> The Eye cream is a very light smooth cream. It is so soothing upon application and has no burning to my eyes. It does not bunch up under my eyes when I apply my makeup. Some other eye creams can cause residue to lift up and make my makeup application flawed. This is the perfect consistence and I love the feeling it gives. It is very hydrating and my darkened areas under my eyes are improved. I normally do not suffer from dark under eye circles, but the past few weeks have been long and this is helping me out. I was sent this for review and does not effect my thoughts or opinions. I was sent this for review and does not effect my thoughts or opinions.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t yet speak to long term usage as I&#x27;ve just been using this product for about a week.  The texture is impressive, though. Light, but it is so silky, there is absolutely no tugging or pulling on the delicate skin around the eyes.  It absorbs quickly as well and the smell is pleasant, but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I frequently have puffy dry eyes from not sleeping and this honestly helps to make them less puffy.  It makes me look like I&#x27;ve had a full nights sleep.  I can use it first thing in the morning under my make-up and then I use it at night before bed.  The fine lines have started to diminish after just a week of use.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how much better they look in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Light and non greasy - absorbs quick - I like this cream a lot</li>
    <li> When I remember to apply 2x daily (morning and evening), the cream seems to reduce puffiness and bleeding of my makeup, so mascara and eyeliner stay in place better.  However, my eyes are somewhat large, so I have fairly large bags under my eyes.  I&#x27;m 34 so they don&#x27;t sag too much yet, but they do tend to get red spots and freckles, which the cream does not reduce.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not yet seeing a dramatic difference since I started using the cream.  I will continue to apply it to see if this changes over time.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t like the smell from this product.</li>
    <li> I like it. Helps with under eye puffiness and smells pretty good.</li>
    <li> a little goes  along way!!!&lt;br /&gt;amazing eye cream, better that other creams I used that cost three times as much.  My reason for 4 stars:  I have been using it for about ten days and it didn&#x27;t do anything for my dark circles so far.  But I have never found anything to help my dark circles...so maybe I&#x27;m stuck with having to use concealer!</li>
    <li> This eye cream improved my dark circles, puffiness and wrinkles the first time I used it.  I&#x27;m really not upset with some eye wrinkles as I age, but the discolorization and puffiness has always made me self conscious. I&#x27;m not a big makeup wearer, so when I try and use concealers I just make it look worse. I bought this product along with the Body Merry retinol moisturizer cream and the retinol serum.  My initial opinion of those products is positive too.  The retinol moisturizing cream leaves makes my face feeling like a pre-makeup primer - velvety smooth and softer looking. I&#x27;ll give an update in a few weeks and let you know if I&#x27;m still this happy with the eye cream.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this cream. I think it&#x27;s the 3rd time I&#x27;ve bought this for her and she says it still works wonders. She also uses it on her face for the dark spots and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes my eye area, so I fee like I see less of crow&#x27;s feet. but I have yet to see more dramatic results.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and wonderful product, thank you! I&#x27;ve started to notice a change in my skin, it looks 10 years younger. I have seasonal allergies and this has given me more confidence. I&#x27;m sure it will work even better over time. It was nice to see a change so quickly!</li>
    <li> I am an indian and had dark circles for all my adult years. This cream brought a difference and making me look much much better. Its been a few weeks now and i hope my problem will be cured in a month or two.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference from using this product.  It has a strong odor that makes it unpleasant to use at night.  The smell is hard to describe but bizarrely reminds me of Cherry Coke.</li>
    <li> This eye cream works like a charm on my dark circles, I can notice a difference if I don&#x27;t use it the previous night, next morning I have to use the concealer. The effects start showing after 1 single application. I never tend to follow a beauty regime. Products just occupy my counter space without everyday attention from me. This is the one that I stick to everyday, because of the huge difference it makes. The ingredients list is amazing too, no wonder it works so well. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using it for a day now as a base for my makeup i use it above my eye before my foundation and my eye concealer and i have to say it actually make my eye shadow stay in place, i was expecting it to completely wash off or make my lids greasy like most do and my eye shadow to disappear because of it however that is so not the case it&#x27;s actually made my eye shadow last longer, such a surprise. I did put up a vlog for you all so you would get to see the product itself first hand in my hand so you can actually see the top of it the dispenser is so cute on it and the smell is really amazing, thank goodness i cant stress enough on the non greasy feeling, i have just got my face ph back to normal and if it was greasy it would have completely blown my mind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This cream claims to reduce dark circles, puffiness, and hydrate skin. It also says you can use it as an all over face lotion, but it has a high oil content, so I&#x27;m hesitant to use it all over because the oil might cause me to break out. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on your skin though, it soaks in really fast, and a little goes a long way since it smooths on so easily.&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a little plastic container with a pump, the picture below is how much comes out in one pump, but half of that amount is more than enough for both eyes. Even though it&#x27;s a small container, since you only have to use an infinitesimal amount, I think this will last for quite a while. It felt very moisturizing on my skin, and it didn&#x27;t cause any problems when I applied my normal eye makeup over it afterwards. It has a unique smell to it though, a sort of herbal smell that I really enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I really love this cream for your night treatment to hydrate,rejuvenate, &amp; calm puffiness.  Leaves a very clean silky, velvety&lt;br /&gt;feel &amp; absorbs into the skin without a sticky or greasy feel.  I also use Body Merry Eye Gel during the day &amp; under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients are pure &amp; have not caused any irritation.  For 50+ skin this is the eye cream to use.  It has taken me several&lt;br /&gt;months to find an eye cream &amp; gel that works.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice eye cream. Its not oily and really does work. I&#x27;ve been using the free sample bottle and can already see a diffrrence in the tonr of my skin. It&#x27;s an awesome product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really see any difference I use it daily</li>
    <li> I have tried lots of eye creams and this is one of the best - especially for the price.  Dark circles and fine lines around the eyes are, in my opinion, one of the most aging things - and people notice.  If someone has dark circles under their eyes, no matter how young they are, they look tired and worn out.  As we get older, it is even more important to keep the skin around the eyes hydrated and soft looking.  It is really possible to avoid laugh lines completely and lighten those dark circles. I would recommend this product for women and men of any age.</li>
    <li> I really love this eye cream. It&#x27;s light and the smell is refreshing, not overpowering, and a very small dollop can cover both eyes. I would love a full face version of this product! I didn&#x27;t see an overnight difference with my dark circles, but after using it for several weeks I do feel like there has been improvement. I would definitely buy this again and recommend!</li>
    <li> Okay under eye cream, but after using for a month I still didn&#x27;t really notice a difference. The smell is also unpleasant, way too sweet and the pump does not work properly.</li>
    <li> The cream has a nice texture and moisturizes the eye area well.  Regrettably it has a very strong witch hazel fragrance. The first night it gave me a headache.  Whenever I have worn it during the day, it competes heavily with any fragrance I choose to wear.  Unfortunately, the witch hazel smell reminds me of men&#x27;s drug store after shave.  I have become somewhat &amp;#34;nose blind&amp;#34; to the smell by now.  Unfortunately friends and coworker aren&#x27;t so blessed.  This would be a great product if it had far less fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love this product...smells great and I love the texture. Item arrived on time.  Would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I have horrendous purple circles, or I did until I began to use this eye cream. They are not all gone, by any means, but after about a month I have noticed a marked improvement, and so have other people. I have gone from looking like someone punched me in the face to looking perhaps rather tired. Given where I started, I think this is a great result. I hope the circles will continue to fade, but the truth is no treatment has ever brought me this far. The cream is smooth going on, and seems to be completely non-irritating. I&#x27;m grateful to have found this stuff. It has helped where nothing else has. And as an extra bonus, the company emailed me a few weeks ago to see how it was going. Great customer support.</li>
    <li> Miracle cream? I&#x27;m not sure. Does it help? Yeah. I&#x27;ve been using this daily for the past month or so and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed an improvement in the dark circles under my eyes. This combined with a good night&#x27;s sleep almost eliminates them entirely.</li>
    <li> Used for for four straight months.  Absolutely no effect whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: bumped up to 3 stars due to good customer service.</li>
    <li> After using this product since the day I received it free for a review, I was amazed by how fast &amp; well it worked!! It has been years since I have not had dark rings under my eyes, &amp; now I don&#x27;t. I am so happy with this product!</li>
    <li> It seems nice.. I like that it absorbs pretty well and that you just need little to use it.</li>
    <li> Really like this.  I have dark circles which I never could get rid of. This seems to be helping. Smoothes lines also. Great for puffiness</li>
    <li> Due to a hereditary iron deficiency and anemia, I&#x27;ve suffered from dark under eye circles for a few years. This product has honestly helped to reduce the appearance of them though and is also great under makeup. Oftentimes I&#x27;ll put this on first when I get out the shower before I put on my makeup , so I will get the max effect before going out. I recommend it to all!</li>
    <li> I love this product so much. I have been using it for only a few days and the circles under my eyes are getting better. They are not as puffy as they were. They seem to also be a little bit lighter too. Highly RECOMMEND this one! I did receive this for a review, but it is 100% my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a dark circle under the eye remover then you must try this eye cream. It works!</li>
    <li> This creme is great for those of you who worry about, any eye concerns I know a lot of us do. This cream can handle all of those concerns, from your dark circles, wrinkles, to the puffiness you have sometimes. Even crows feet, fine lines. Besides the dryness and sags and the bags all of this in one cream. That’s awesome all of our problems in this one product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel of it when you put it on is smooth and soft, leaves your eye area looking so much better, This cream is perfect for your eyes since we reject the idea of using harsh chemicals for the delicate eye area and use natural and organic ingredients instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part of this is the cream can be used on all kinds of skin, that’s an extra to me. I have had my sister use it around her eyes, she has all of the above and she loves the way it leaves her eyes looking smooth and great. This is a great cream for people with those eye issues. Use this, you will be happy you did.</li>
    <li> LOOOVE this product! It is very creamy and has a nice scent. i noticed a difference in my crows feet right away. i would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Soft, smooth cream that goes right in with the perfect anti-aging ingredients...really like!</li>
    <li> This product is really not that effective. I didnt see any significant changes.</li>
    <li> This cream soaks right in, and make the undereye area soft, which in turn makes concealer application much easier.</li>
    <li> I used this eye cream for a week straight. I applied the cream once a day in the morning under my left eye. This eye cream can be used twice a day if you like to use it that often. I did see some results in the weeks time that I have been using the product. the darkness under my eye started to get lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye cream comes in a thick slim tube container and has an easy push dispenser. The colors of the packaging are very pleasing to the eye. The white, turquoise, &amp; black colors makes the product easy to identify and simple to read all of its information.  The push dispenser allows you the ability to only dispense as much of the product as you need.The eye cream is white and as a light scent to it. The eye cream is very light and easy to apply. A little eye cream goes along way. After you apply the cream there is no residue or lingering smell. Also this product is made in the USA and is not tested on animals. I would recommend this product to anyone that is dealing with darkness under their eyes. (I received this product to review, but my opinions are strictly my own.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m SUPER happy with this product and I am going to get another one! I already bought 2 because I lost the first one. I like the small size so that I can carry it in my little purse. I like to apply it during the day to refresh my eyes at work. I&#x27;m not sure I see any difference/improvement in my dark circles or wrinkles, but I like the way the lotion feels, it&#x27;s definitely refreshing, and it never burns, even when I&#x27;ve gotten it in my eyes. I also LOVE the packaging (clean pump) - I never use pots of goo that I have to stick (and re-stick) my fingers into. I&#x27;ll never understand that whole concept - fingers carry bacteria, so you should never stick your fingers in creams! AND I love the fact that the product is affordable. I&#x27;m one of the skeptics who won&#x27;t spend too much $$ on magic potions. Your product, pricing, packaging, and size are all a 1000% fit for me. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Seems to do an OK job moisturizing, but as with all eye creams, it&#x27;ll take a little time to see if it actually has any meaningful results. Dispenser is kind of hard to get a feel for - it&#x27;s very easy to dispense too much of the product if you&#x27;re not careful, so use a light touch when pumping it. I&#x27;ve had dark circles since I was a kid, though, and I don&#x27;t see any difference on that front.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to receive this for review on my blog and it&#x27;s great! I love that it&#x27;s a cream, not a gel. I don&#x27;t like the gels. It absorbs quickly and has no fragrance. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> I liked the texture and was really hoping to love the product, even though the smell is pretty strong.  My under eye area started to itch and one side immediately swelled up!!! :(  I do have a very hard time finding something that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  What I&#x27;ve been using is great but not moisturizing.  Would love my money back but I didn&#x27;t receive a return tag or receipt for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several months later: I continue to order this because I gave my first bottle to my MIL and she really likes it.  She keeps asking me to order more when she runs out.  She&#x27;s not very sensitive to much at all.  She likes the moisture this provides and uses it religiously.</li>
    <li> I love this product! You can&#x27;t beat the quality for the price. Will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on the staggering number of good reviews and the reasonable price. I was not disappointed! I&#x27;ve used tons of under eye creams, and while I certainly don&#x27;t expect miracles, this delivered on many levels. It does soften the under eye area without making it oily. This is really important to me because oily eye creams cause my mascara and liner to smear (giving that lovely heroin chic look). While it doesn&#x27;t do away with under eye wrinkles and fine lines (nothing short of surgery will do that), it does make them much less noticeable. I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in under eye puffiness or dark circles, however. I tend to have puffiness in the morning, and even though I liberally applied the eye cream before bed to under eyes and on lids, I still see that continuing. My dark circles aren&#x27;t super dark, just darker than I&#x27;d like, but I still have to use concealer and noticed no difference there either. I am purchasing another bottle of this, though, because I really love the way it softens the skin under my eyes and makes those irritating signs of aging much less noticeable. Also, I find the scent to be very pleasing - sort of a light floral/herbal fragrance. This is one eye cream that is not going to end up in the Pile of Failed Face Products! I also use it as a moisturizer on my neck and decollete (my face is too oily for moisturizers). Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Previously I have been using the Sweetsation Therapy I&#x27;Light cream (http://www.amazon.com/Organic-Advanced-Brightening-Smoothing-Treatment/dp/B003Y04OK0/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1424708513&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3). I loved the results with that product but it was too expensive for me. I purchased the Body Merry eye cream because it had many of the same ingredients but the price was one-third of the Sweetsation Therapy cream. Below is a comparison of the two products.&lt;br /&gt;Results:&lt;br /&gt;--I found the Sweetsation Therapy cream more moisturizing compared to the Body Merry cream.&lt;br /&gt;--The Sweetsation Therapy cream left a dewy glow on my skin that I really liked. However the Body Merry cream soaked right in and is probably much better to wear under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;--The Sweetsation Therapy cream has a beautiful warm woody fragrance, whereas the Body Merry cream has a herbal smell, a lot like basil and is actually quite refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;--With the Sweetsation Therapy cream I saw dark circles disappear in just a few days. The Body Merry cream took about two weeks to achieve similar results but in the end I think I am satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> uumm... amazing and under $20?! yes please. I just bought my second jar of this magic potion. Fine lines disappear, they seriously do!!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried most of Body Merry&#x27;s products (at my own expense) and I am obsessed. I currently use this eye cream  ( I believe the color of the packaging changed) after  applying the BM Hyaluronic acid serum and then I use the retinol moisturizer, also by BM. My skin has improved so much. I was starting to get some serious lines on my forehead and those have smooth so much. Very impressive quality, affordable, ships super fast AND their costumer service is top notch. Cannot say enough good things about them and their product!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I had a bad reaction to the cream...the skin around my eyes got covered in rash and then peeled three days later. Even though I&#x27;ve had used products that contain Retinol, Glycolic and other exfoliating ingredients this was too abrasive for me. Not for sensitive skin I guess.</li>
    <li> I am searching for a facial regimen that will help reduce the signs of aging (I am 39 and have not spent a lot of time in the sun).  Meaning, I&#x27;d like the following basic results:  a smoothing of wrinkles around my eyes; less dark under-eye circles; and a lightening of age spots/color imperfections.  I tried LilyAna Naturals brand items first, and found absolutely no effect.  The company, however, does have VERY good customer service and their product quality was good.  Just no impact on my skin.  SO, for my second attempt at a new facial care brand, I chose to try Body Merry products.  I purchased this (1) Body Merry Vitamin C serum, (2) the Body Merry Retinol Surge Moisturizer and (3) the Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream.  I purchased all three, hoping that by not mixing different brands (i.e. moisturizer, eye cream and Vitamin C serum) they&#x27;re work well together.  Result?  Sad to say, again NO IMPACT.  My goal is NOT to try a million facial products and review them all.  I really am trying to find a facial regime that works.  So I&#x27;m disappointed that this second line of products didn&#x27;t preform any better than the previous brand.  The Body Merry products do seem high quality.  The packaging is nice. But I&#x27;m not back to looking through a million amazon reviews, trying to find *something that actually works.*  In order to show my skin imperfections that I&#x27;m hoping to improve (and the lack of any benefit from these Body Merry products), I had my husband take some close up photos of my face to share (not fun!).  If you look at the photos, you&#x27;ll see I have brown discoloration spots all along my cheekbones, along the sides of my nose and on the skin above my lips.  I tried the Vitamin C product and the Retinol Surge Moisturizer for 3 weeks now, and there has been NO fading of any of the spots shown in the photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this eye cream in particular, I DO like the natural, herbal type smells in the eye cream. And the lotion is nice and creamy.  But I am not noticing a reduction in the wrinkles around my eyes, or the dark circles under my eyes (yes, my eye skin is hydrated after application, but the wrinkles and circles remain).icing a reduction in the wrinkles around my eyes, or the dark circles under my eyes (yes, my eye skin is hydrated after application, but the wrinkles and circles remain).</li>
    <li> did not see any difference since I have been using it.. does nothing like it said..Not satisfied at all!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a change. Waste of money. At least it smells nice. But.... I did try there gel for dark circles and I think the gel product works way better then the cream.</li>
    <li> I like this cream. Has a fresh scent. Not greasy and provides gentle moisture to eye area. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> It has a lovely scent.  Looks like my dark circles are improving.  It is refreshing.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, I would recommend it to everyone in my family</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this cream. Not only is it smooth and I really like the texture, but it seems to improve greatly the fine wrinkles that had started to appear around my eyes. I have a very sensitive skin and can barely use any makeup around my eyes (not even mentioning eye makeup removal lotions) but had absolutely ZERO issue (no redness, stinging sensation, or allergic reaction like I use to have with pretty much any other product) with this cream. Will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I just started using it no irritation love it</li>
    <li> Works well to rid my eyes of dark circles, gently moisturizing without leaving skin oily. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is beginning to get dark circles under their eyes, as well as those who have had them for a longer period of time.</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream! It goes on easy &amp; works good under make up! And the scent is wonderful!  I will definitely be back to purchase this again!</li>
    <li> This was one of the many gifts I have given to my bf&#x27;s sweet grandmother; we get along really well and she&#x27;s been nothing but kind and generous to me (my bf is her BABY and she raised him, so you know I gotta get on &#x27;gramma&#x27;s&#x27; good side lol). Before I introduced her to anti-aging products, she was very old school; she did not believe on putting all those products on your face except for cocoa butter. I convinced her to try some anti-aging products for her face and now she&#x27;s HOOKED! When I introduced her to this eye cream, she was like, &#x27;this better not burn my eyes now&#x27; lol. I told her it&#x27;s very calming and it will not irritate her eyes. Well she tried it on and she loves it. She said that even though it said cream, it&#x27;s not like your normal cream where it&#x27;s too thick and &#x27;greasy&#x27;; this is lightweight and is easily absorbed leaving her skin soft and smooth. She&#x27;s using this religiously and her eyes look a lot better and &#x27;alive&#x27;. Luckily, I was able to purchase this during the company&#x27;s promotion, and seeing what it has done to my bf&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s eyes, I totally recommend this product. Great to use in the morning before you put on your make up.</li>
    <li> Recommend using this product right before bed! Although I have seen quite a difference, it makes my eyes water, so I have to use it while I am sleeping! Great product!</li>
    <li> Used for about a month now and my dark circles are lighter.</li>
    <li> I was worried buying this cream, because I have sensitive skin. But at an affordable price and great reviews I went ahead. So glad I did. It leaves my eyes feeling and looking youthful. I apply twice a day</li>
    <li> Great product thank you!</li>
    <li> This wonderful eye cream is rich and concentrated so you don&#x27;t have to use very much. Because I have extremely sensitive skin and eyes I have tried an endless number of eye treatment products that caused various side effects, mostly red, burning, irritated, and watery eyes,..... This product is gentle, soothing, and offers wonderful hydration without causing my eyes to burn or water. It has not done anything to reduce my eye puffiness, though.  But then I don&#x27;t believe any cosmetic product can reduce puffy eyes or get rid of dark circles.  Doesn&#x27;t much matter because my eyes feel wonderfully pampered, moisturized, and soft after weeks of using this gentle eye cream.  Thank you Body Merry.</li>
    <li> I love it...it improves my dark eye circles</li>
    <li> From day 1 you feel it working,you just need a little bit to apply it around your eyes,so a bottle will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> I have seen a difference in the puffiness of my eyes and also the dark circles. It definitely works and I have only been using it for a week. I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Great eye cream and does not irritate at all.  Shipping was fast and on time.  This seller is great and even sent me an email on how to use the product.  I will definitely be buying again the price is good and so is the product.</li>
    <li> Love this i saw a great improvement after using it for only a few days. Not only does it work but it smells wonderful too!</li>
    <li> This eye cream has a floral scent, which I love, and absorbs nicely into the skin. I haven&#x27;t noticed an incredible difference in elasticity, but I do notice that the skin in that area is smoother and softer. Also, the skin around my eyes is usually red due to applying and removing makeup regularly, but there is a significant reduction in redness since using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Product provided for review without cost. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I really, really like this product and I would highly recommend Age Defense Eye Cream to anyone who , like me, has begun to have saggy skin issues around or under the eyes. Not only has this cream reduced the puffiness on my eyelids, but i am noticing a reduction in the size of the sacks I carrying around under my peepers. Also in the dry cold of the winter months, my eyelids had become dry, cracked  and very sore (I know, sounds gross...it was). With only a few applications, Age Defense Eye Cream completely cured the condition. That relief alone was well worth the purchase price.  Age Defense Eye Cream is easy to apply, is absorbed easily by the skin and has a pleasant scent. The difference it has made on my weather beaten old wreck of a face is astonishingly positive. I will continue to use and recommend Age Defense Eye Cream .</li>
    <li> This works really well! I love how a little really does go a long way, it absorbs quickly and does not leave any greasy feeling afterwards, I use this once in the morning and once before bed, It even does really well with me putting my makeup on overtop of this eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about a week and have noticed a reduction in my under eye wrinkles and dark circles. Has a very light delicate smell which is pleasing, and I no longer look as tired anymore. I will be using this product for a long long time!</li>
    <li> I was able to get this product with a code that gave me a steep discount. I love it!! It works so well!</li>
    <li> I was recently able to try this product and was suprised to find that I liked it a lot! I typically am skeptical when it comes to face creams as there are SO many that say they do everything imaginable... This product worked well, smelled nice and is a product I would recommend if your looking for a new eye cream!</li>
    <li> I am not sure about it as I have not seen any changes</li>
    <li> I have used this product and have no issues with it I&#x27;m still trying to decide between another product I use. No decisionyet.</li>
    <li> I love it, love it, love it.Works like a charm. I put it on as soon as it arrived and was able to see the result in 10 minutes. I never could imagine that cream can make such a difference on my face. I will continue use it day and night. All of my friend already aware of this product. Thanks a lot to produce such a great product.</li>
    <li> Update:  I have now been using this eye cream for a few months and I still love it.  My eyes feel so much better and there no puffyness nor dark circles.  This is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original comment: When I started using the product a few weeks ago, my eyes were sore and puffy. I was&lt;br /&gt;using a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; eye cream day and night, but it just didn&#x27;t seem to help. Since using&lt;br /&gt;this my eyes feel better, are no longer puffy and the dark circles have diminished.&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it on a couple of age spots (I am in my 40&#x27;s) and they are lighter.&lt;br /&gt;I an thrilled with this product!</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. It is making my fave feel firm and looks all one color,  taking out the sun spots. I love it.</li>
    <li> Smooth eye cream. It hydrated my under eye area very well, visibly plumping up some dehydration lines I had.</li>
    <li> I can feel and see it making a difference around my eye area. I would recommend this to anyone. It really works.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  It doesn&#x27;t do much for dark circles but it smoothes the skin around my eyes.  It is great to be able to review this product and I appreciate the opportunity to do so.</li>
    <li> Since I have been using this eye product am noticing little improvements, it&#x27;s only been about 3 weeks so far am satisfied and I like the oganic scent. Thumbs up...</li>
    <li> Smells like vinegar and death.  Horrible.</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive skin around my eyes. My eyes water easily when serums or  moisturizers get too close, if they are not gentle. I was hesitant to try this product,as I have never heard of the brand before. BODY MERRY eye cream has  been working for me! Is it a miracle in a bottle? No...but the skin surrounding my eyes can get a much needed blast of moisture from this cream without my eyes watering or turning red. I have used this morning and night for almost 9 days with no side effects, issues or tears. I was given the opportunity to test and try this product and I am glad I did. I can keep using this safely, without worry, knowing I am moisturizing an area of my skin I would typically otherwise miss. I can highly recommend this product, as it has been working for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a &amp;#34;product person&amp;#34; but I decided to give this a try when I was given an offer to try it at a substantial discount to review and test it....and I LOVE it... I have puffy eyes with dark circles and within a few days my eyes are already looking better... Definitely worth the full price.... thank you!</li>
    <li> Works good. Has a very hydrating effect around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Two things that I love are that this product is not tested on animals and is made in the USA. You only need a small amount of this product to get the job done. The cream absorbs quickly so your make up can go on smoothly. I won&#x27;t say for sure that I noticed an improvement in the dark circles under my eyes, but my eye area does appear to be smoother. The cream was non-irritating and I found it quite sensitive. This is a product that I can use both day and night. I&#x27;m quiet satisfied. Disclosure: I received a free sample of this product. All thoughts expressed here are my own.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any major differences around my eyes but it is very hydrating and is very light weight. The smell really bothers me but after applied goes away in a few minutes.</li>
    <li> It works for me I have noticed that the dark spots around my eyes have diminished and my face has more of a glow and moisture.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Cream. It is so nice!</li>
    <li> Been using this since I got it. U definitely don&#x27;t need much. This is rich and goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I liked the texture and I think it helped.</li>
    <li> This eyecream does everything it promises! I am so impressed. Dark circles have diminished so quickly I barely have to wear any concealer and often I can go makeup less. My little crows feet are practically gone...I have nice smooth skin around my eyes. Needless to say I&#x27;m a customer for life.</li>
    <li> This cream is not just effective but also very refreshing. Love the melony smell of it! It is a must try for everyone. I would give it five stars!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man but use women&#x27;s facial creams. Hey -- the men stuff sucks! Nice bottle that works handily and contains all natural products. The carcinogens in many beauty products scare me so this product is a welcome change. I&#x27;ll update once I&#x27;ve used it for a month.&lt;br /&gt;OK, a couple weeks are up. My first comment is that I don&#x27;t see a lot of difference compared my previous D&#x27;Oreo (LOL) product. Maybe in a few more weeks? I&#x27;ll be honest that I have not paid a lot of attention but will start looking at my bags to see if they have shrunk and lightened. However, I am comforted that this product is made of natural products and I don&#x27;t notice the stinging if I get too much on. This product will last a long time as one drop will do both eyes. Will buy again when my pump bottle runs out (in about six months LOL). Recommend.</li>
    <li> It feels nice on the skin, doesn&#x27;t feel like oil but it helps nothing in preventing the wrinkles or puffiness.</li>
    <li> David&#x27;s wife Karen here. I got this product free to try and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. I always have dark circles because of lack of a good night&#x27;s sleep. This eye cream has reduced the dark circles significantly. You can hardly see the darkness.</li>
    <li> I keep this in my purse and blot it on my eves several times a day over my makeup. I feel like it&#x27;s helping my skin to look much more alive and healthier.</li>
    <li> This a great eye cream!  I have been using for a few weeks now and I am seeing wonderful results.  I love that is has a list of really good ingredients, it goes on easily, I just need a little bit and it absorbs almost as fast as I put it on.  So I never get that greasy feeling on my skin.  I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I normally use PTR for my eyes, since I was young I have always had dark puffy circles under my eyes no matter how long I rest at night or what is going on in my life. When I first used this product I was skeptical because I had never heard of the brand before, I&#x27;m thankful I took the chance. While the price in comparison is much lower then other high level brands the treatment is wonderful and pretty quick working in my experience. I cannot express if it works for everybody or certain skin types. I have very fair skin and have never suffered from breakouts. I plan on purchasing this product again and hopefully it will continue to work this well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for one week and I have seen some slight changes in the appearance of dark circles. I think it will take a little longer to see more significant results. I like the way the product feels on my skin. Skin products work for some people and not others. This product is working for me and I would recommend. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after using it for a few weeks, that will be the true test. I received this at a reduced price to review, this did not affect my opinion in anyway.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes and minimizes fine lines around your eyes.</li>
    <li> Cream did nothing for my dark circles and fine lines. Had very high hopes</li>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way and it feels good on your fingers before you put it on your puffy eyes</li>
    <li> This little bottle is a life-saver!! One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made on Amazon. When I wake up exhausted in the morning with dark, puffy eyes, this cream wakes me right up and makes me look young and fresh! And it smells awesome - minty and fresh.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. I have noticed great results.</li>
    <li> Time will tell if this product works. Figured I&#x27;d give it a try. Cheaper than plastic surgery. Easy to apply and unnoticeable, a little goes a long way. Received an e-mail with clear instructions for usage. That was a nice touch.</li>
    <li> Very happy with results if this product!</li>
    <li> This work wonder under my eyes and amazing on the rest of my face i Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Works great for all types of skin, I will definitely be buying again. I used it For my face, Skin, great product and high quality!</li>
    <li> It makes my under eye smooth but it burn my eyes. I have used it for a month now and still haven&#x27;t seen any improvement. I was really excited by reading at the good reviews but i don&#x27;t think its for me. I hope after some time it starts working for me also.</li>
    <li> Moisturing but I don&#x27;t notice it coving/masking the dark circles</li>
    <li> Great texture and fragrance!  No reduction in dark circles yet though.</li>
    <li> Very nice eye cream. I use it every day and my eyes look great, my skin feels so soft</li>
    <li> Omg I love this cream. Works well and fast. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Easy to use eye cream, pure ingredients to help the dark circles and dry skin, easily absorbed into your skin!</li>
    <li> Fragrance was not my favorite :/</li>
    <li> Eye cream is a nice texture and smell. I have only used it a short time.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, work as described. I have six kids and sleep doesn&#x27;t come easy and you can not tell once I started using this product.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working great</li>
    <li> Did really work all that good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and it seems to be working great! I feel like I already see a difference. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I used this for 2 months and saw no results at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 31 so I don&#x27;t have any lines yet, this is more preventative. I will say I have noticed it did help with circles under my eyes though. The first 2 days it had a very slight tingle when applied but now I don&#x27;t feel it. I have been using it about 2 weeks now and I do like it.</li>
    <li> Great sized bottle for the price.  Very good formulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product at a reduced cost.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a skeptic, but when I woke this morning, I was amazed. There was already a noticeable difference around my eyes. Wrinkles less defined, skin appeared and felt more smooth! I can&#x27;t wait to see how I look in a week...or MONTH!</li>
    <li> Light feel and pleasant fragrance. Great for daily use.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and on some occasions get bags under my eyes so I decided to try this product. It is packed with all the essential peptides necessary for a healthy skin and best of all, it is lightweight and serves as a great base for my makeup. I typically apply it at night before bed (to prevent the bags from happening in the first place) and occasionally in the morning (if I don&#x27;t apply it at night). It feels slightly oily but the benefits I&#x27;ve gotten is worth the extra blotting paper. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to fight unnecessary wrinkles and swollen face.</li>
    <li> This Stuff work&#x27;s great  !!!!!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for about 2months. I have not noticed a drastic lightening of darkness but I don&#x27;t have alot of darkness to begin with, I have however seen a great deal of moisture around the eye area which is what I was hoping to get. Because of the added moisture, my wrinkles seem less noticeable under my makeup. I Pat it in 2 times p/day, morning and night after my hyalaraunic acid then apply a moisturizer to my entire face and neck. It smells Amazing! And a little goes a long way, I only use about 1/2 a pump. Will repurchase!</li>
    <li> have been using for a couple of weeks now in conjunction with the c serum and my wrinkles and crinkles are getting smoother by the day!!</li>
    <li> I was sent this eye cream by Body Merry to review for my blog &amp; I love it so far!  First impressions are everything and I have to say that I really liked the packaging for the eye cream.  The Age Defense Eye Cream comes in a great little bottle with pump that allows you to dispense just the right amount of product needed.  Of course the most important thing is the actual product and thankfully that was pretty awesome too!  I have been using the eye cream for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results so far.  I use it every morning &amp; I love that the light cream absorbs really quickly into my skin and leaves it soft &amp; smooth and takes away my morning eye puffiness.  Great stuff :)</li>
    <li> Smells great- very creamy and moisturizing.  I will buy again!</li>
    <li> I love my eye cream can tell a v u g difference in the color under my eyes great product</li>
    <li> Great product and has a pleasant scent to it. Good sized container where you only have to use a little each application, so I bet it&#x27;ll last for a couple of months.</li>
    <li> Great for my dark circles.</li>
    <li> Use it daily. Great eye cream</li>
    <li> overall a great eye cream. it smells awesome you cant beat the price for the eye cream. a little bit of this cream goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream! Just based on all the natural ingredients, I already knew it was going to to great. I have been using this for almost 5 months? I still have a lot left so this bottle can really last a LONG TIME. I noticed less dark circles and more moisturized and fresh eyes after using this product. I use this day and night, and a little goes a long way. I massage it all over my eye and I just feel refreshed! It also smells very fresh and natural. I highly recommend this. For the price it is such a great deal.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t pay full-price for this cream but I did spend money on it. I started using it around the time I used Body Merry&#x27;s face retinol face serum and retinol moisturizer. It is a great moisturizer for the day time. It absorbs quickly and keeps your delicate eye area moisturized. I think by end of May I will need to purchase another bottle. I doubt I&#x27;ll get a discount next time but this cream works well for me so I don&#x27;t even mind. It keeps puffiness and bags away (believe me I pull all nighters writing). It makes me look like I get a good 7 to 8 hours of sleep every night. lol</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this eye cream a few weeks twice a day and I&#x27;m starting to see a difference in my dark circles. I&#x27;m needing to use less concealer.</li>
    <li> I did notice some dark circle removal.  I do have deep dark circles and am greek so perhaps that is why there hasn&#x27;t been 100% removal.</li>
    <li> So far I like this eye cream. I didn&#x27;t notice any smell that other reviewers are complaining about. It absorbs really well into the skin so it can be worn under make up. I like to warm my skin up with a hot washcloth especially under my eyes morning and night before I add my serums and creams. I&#x27;ve noticed tightening and improved firmness after just a few applications. It also tingles a bit for a few minutes after application.  I look forward to seeing its effectiveness after a few more weeks.</li>
    <li> goes on nicely, absorbers really well, I can out on concealer and it doesnt crease! Great pump also, a dab will do ya! Will definitely re-order, I the ingredients.Thanks Kushboo for your great follow up.</li>
    <li> Still have dark circles after a month of use. Fine lines look better though. I doubt I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> We shall see.  Thanks</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference. I used it under my eyes and on my neck. I had to discontinue use due to the overpowering smell. Awful!</li>
    <li> made my under eyes dry and look older I m a 44 years old female before I purchased red all the review which was over 1000 its just crap ! didnt work for me at all I would never spend a dollar for this cream</li>
    <li> The saying the eyes are the window to the soul, truly knew you can look at someones face and tell their age. I got Body Merry&#x27;s eye cream to review and glad I did. I just turned 40 and I have started noticing small lines around my eyes, and a wrinke on my forehead. I added Body Merry&#x27;s eye cream to my daily regimen of cleansing in the morning right after I wash and dry my face. I allow it to dry and then apply my makeup. It helps keep the area moisturized all day long and makeup doesnt settle into the fine lines. It comes in a pump and a very small amount is needed. It smells so good, like essential oils. It comes in a large container and will last me a very long time. I highly recommend this product to everyone who is looking for a eye cream that helps with wrinkles and crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
    <li> I got this product for review.&lt;br /&gt; This Product is nice but i just didn&#x27;t like the fact that i put it at night and when i wake up i usually rub my eyes &amp; with this on it just well this product just sits there under the eyes it dries like a cast and when i rub my eyes it peels off and it goes inside my eyes which was uncomfortable with me. I tried it a second time and the same thing happened to me, so i just gave up on it. sad but true.</li>
    <li> I was excited to review this product to review.  The eye cream was very non-greasy and absorbed instantly into my skin.  It was more light-weight than other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used in the past, and had a pleasant scent that reminded me of citrus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a mommy, you probably get 10+ hours of sleep every night just like I do, but this product is fantastic for those &amp;#34;rare&amp;#34; nights where you may have not gotten quite enough.  It does an excellent job at reducing swelling under the eyes and making those dark circles less noticeable!  Considering it&#x27;s called &#x27;Age Defense&#x27;, I&#x27;d have to assume this product will also help me in the long run! ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed circles have lightened and puffiness has decreased. Best eye cream I&#x27;ve used yet! No harsh chemicals, purfumy smells, or burning. Does what it claims.</li>
    <li> This is a nice light-consistency eye cream. It boasts an impressive list of 70 ingredients including peptides, retinols, various other vitamins, and moisturizing ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is light-consistency and absorbs easily. It can be worn during the day under makeup or in the evening. I prefer to wear it at night due to the retinol content. After application, the skin around my eyes does feel a little tighter and softer. I think my dark circles have been a little less noticeable, but it is hard to attribute that to any one thing as I find sleep quality is really the biggest factor. I believe the ingredients may give a little cosmetic help to those who have dark circles. I also like the attractive pump bottle dispenser. One pump usually distributes the right amount for an application. I expect this one ounce bottle would last a couple months with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extensive ingredient list is both a plus and a minus, in my opinion. It is a plus because the ingredients are popular in many anti-aging, moisturizing and skin products. It is a minus, because the more ingredients the higher the risk of reaction or sensitivity. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, in my experience Body Merry&#x27;s eye cream is mild as I haven&#x27;t had a reaction to it yet. I have been using it for about two weeks before writing this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for anyone looking for a light-consistency eye cream that contains peptides, retinols, hyaluronic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product from Body Merry in hopes that I would try it and review. I have been using it daily for about two weeks.</li>
    <li> Another winner!  I have had the privilege of trying and reviewing The Body Merry Brand of Age Defense Eye Cream complementary by the company.  I have been wearing contact lenses for the last 30 years.  Every time I put my contact lenses in or out, on a daily basis, I pull the delicate tissue around my eyes.  This has caused fine lines.  Also, being a full time working mom, I know I do not get the amount of sleep my body needs.  One day this past month, a colleague asked if I was feeling well.  I know she was kindly saying there are dark circles around my eyes.  Age and environment re no kind to the delicate eye area.  When I opened my Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream I was pleasantly surprised of the way it is dispensed.  It comes in a little pump that gives off jus enough, and is so easy to attain.  The cream is smooth and the scent is unique in a good way- pleasant smelling.  It is so easy to apply and is made of all natural ingredients, so I was not afraid to rub it around my eyes.  I found the best time to use it was at night after taking my contact lenses out.  After only a few days, I noticed a difference.  The skin around my eyes seemed smoother and more supple. Ingredients include:  Vitamins (C, E B5),  Retinol, Peptides, Antioxidants, Hyaluronic Acid, minerals and pure plant oil.  The cucumber, witch hazel and rose hip oil leave a nice cooling effect on the skin.  I would highly recommend this product.  It has been the type of eye cream I wish I had had 30 years ago.  It is not a disappointment.</li>
    <li> This lightweight cream really does help alleviate some puffiness under my tired eyes. I use it twice a day morning and night.  I look forward to even more reduced puffiness the longer I use the product.  You only need very minimal and it absorbs very nicely into skin immediately.  No odor.  Really glad I purchased this particular product and am having a positive result from it.</li>
    <li> I got this product to test out for dark circles under my eyes . I have been using it a few weeks and have noticed a difference in the darkness of my circles have gotten lighter and not as noticeable and not as dark. I will continue to use this to keep those dark unwanted circles at bay.  i got  this product free to test out .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice a day (in the AM and before sleep) for about 2 months. I did like how gentle it was. Most new products actually give me a little allergy/irritation, so I was impressed with that. Another thing I did like was that it lasted pretty much all day and the skin around my eyes felt moisturized. Also, the company sent me an e-mail asking how the product was working and reminded me that if I wasn&#x27;t 100% satisfied, they&#x27;d refund me the money. I was beyond impressed with their business ethic and genuine concern for customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the cream didn&#x27;t make any desired changes to the skin around my eyes. I was expecting some improvement (vs. &#x27;maintenance&#x27;) and didn&#x27;t get that. I still have the puffy, dark circles and a couple fine lines. To be fair, I think the skin under my eyes is particularly problematic and I&#x27;ve used other creams in the past as well. All have been unsuccessful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would gladly try another one of their products, even though this particular one didn&#x27;t work for my skin.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time like expected. I used to have other brand of eye cream, but it was oily and felt greasy and doesn&#x27;t see any improvement. Therefore, i try this out after seen so many positive reviews! The size of the eye cream were tint but as long as the cream is good, i do not mind spend a little more to get good and reliable product. I applied it on my eyes gently, massage very gently by clockwise rotation and i felt great (Because it wasn&#x27;t greasy!) I will update the result one week later :) But honestly, i have good feeling about this product :D</li>
    <li> This is a miracle eye cream, lightens dark circles and helps with wrinkles too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is simply wonderful! What an amazing way to reduce wrinkles, crows feet, puffiness and fine lines around my eyes. It is super easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t leave greasy residue behind either! I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> The last eye cream I used always irritated my eyes but it worked on the dark circles and puffiness. This eye cream however was great. It did not irritate and my right eye is usually pretty sensitive to anything I put near it (and that includes mascara and eyeliner). After having my daughter the lack of sleep really worsened my puffy eyes bc I had 2 kids to deal with and I am not a fan of heavy makeup to cover up anything. I rather use a product that works in the long run and helps bring back the natural beauty of my skin. Body Merry really nails it with the natural &amp; organic products that they use and another thing that motivated me was the use of the oils. I am obsessed with natural oils because they are more effective than harsh chemicals and does not irritate my skin. I definitely would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product but I have seen no difference in any of the areas that it &amp;#34;promised&amp;#34; to help with. I have used it for a couple of months - morning and evening. My under eye circles are still as dark and puffy as they were before using the product. I suggest using your money to experiment with something else.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this eye cream for dark circles.  It&#x27;s also good for wrinkles too which I can always use.  Getting older I don&#x27;t always get enough sleep and have bags under my eyes.  I have only been using this for a few days both morning and night.  It a nice consistency, goes on lightly and is absorbed in my skin quickly.  I do not have any stickiness.  I like it&#x27;s a natural product to use on my face along with serums and moisturizers for a more total wrinkle free look and less bags under my eyes.  I will continue using.</li>
    <li> I really love this cream because it smells fantastic, isn&#x27;t greasy, and it does its job!</li>
    <li> I really liked the way that this product absorbed quickly and can be used underneath makeup or without. It doesn&#x27;t seem full of harsh chemicals. Excited to see the results after more use of it. Highly recommended thus far!</li>
    <li> I recently started developing wrinkles so when I was offered this to  review I was excited. So far I am very pleased with it. This cream has made my eyes look great. It has made my dark circles lighter. Puffiness is gone. My wrinkles are barely noticeable now. This cream is light and rubs in easily. I love that is has no harsh chemicals and is cruelty free.</li>
    <li> Disappointed.  Not noticing any improvements.  Things look a little worse, I think</li>
    <li> On day 3 and already see an improvement. Nice fragrance too. So far extremely pleased</li>
    <li> I see no change after 1 month of use</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I&#x27;ve only been using it about a week, but I could see a difference in the skin around my eyes within two applications.  It&#x27;s a cream, not laser surgery in a bottle.  So being realistic, I&#x27;m getting exactly what I thought I would and am really satisfied with the results. If this &amp;#34;posts&amp;#34; as Ken, it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s his wife.  :)</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream.  It absorbs nicely into the eye area and has a pleasant odor.  I have been using if for about a month and I do see a difference in the little creases around my eyes.  I would recommend this eye cream.  It is a great value too!  I think everyone can appreciate that.</li>
    <li> I loved this product! Really worked wonders on my dark circles.  I did get this product for free for testing Purposes.</li>
    <li> Nice cream.  It smells like Mother&#x27;s Market in California ( a health food store )  It reminds me of it every time I put it on.  I like that I don&#x27;t have to put my finger in a jar and get cream under my nail. It does a nice job on the wrinkles too.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is one of the best I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s extremely moisturizing and non-irritating. What&#x27;s great is a little goes a long way and you get 1 ounce compared to 0.5 ounces like most eye creams. What I&#x27;ve seen:&lt;br /&gt;1. The eye area seems smother, soft and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;2. After application, I feel the wrinkles are slightly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;3. The eye area is slightly firmer.&lt;br /&gt;4. It doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this for about 3 weeks, and I have not seen a reduction in wrinkle depth. But, this does lessen the appearance of wrinkles after application. But since it&#x27;s only been 3 weeks, I can&#x27;t say what the long-term effects will be. The eye area is the most delicate area on the face, The skin is thinner and may be harder to repair, meaning it may take more time. I haven&#x27;t seen a reduction in dark circles, however mine aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; bad. I do feel like this eye cream may help slow the aging process in the eye area. Considering I&#x27;ve tried countless eye creams, I can say that any of them are phenomenal, but this one rates up there with the best I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve tried expensive ones and cheaper ones, and considering the price of this one I feel it&#x27;s an effective and reasonably priced option. Definitely worth trying.</li>
    <li> I use this cream in the morning and in the evening and it helps with puffiness on the top part of my eyes and under.  It doesn&#x27;t smear or make my makeup run.  It is a really nice product and I feel like you get alot for your money.</li>
    <li> Thanks ,I&#x27;m happy with this product, I like it.,</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I have been using this product for several weeks and I love it!</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive eyes.  Many anti-aging ingredients elicit an allergic-type reaction, so the eye creams I&#x27;ve used in the past basically just moisturized.  I ordered this cream because it came with a money-back guarantee.  After using it for about a week, I&#x27;ve had no reactions.  Better still, the dark circles and occasional bags I&#x27;ve noticed under my eyes in the last few years are noticeably diminished!  The pump does dispense liberally, but I just put the excess in a little jar and use it the next day.  This cream is definitely worth the money, and I will continue to use it.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Bought these for my mom. She loved them! Thanks for the offer</li>
    <li> i purchased this and gave to my grandmother and so far she is very happy with it</li>
    <li> Most amazing eye cream ever! Been using it for almost three months and I&#x27;ll never go back to anything else. I love the way this makes my skin feel under my eyes. They look and feel soft, brightened and awake. It doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy or sticky at all (huge plus)I use it before bed mainly, but anytime I do my face washing routine, I use this and one of Body Merry&#x27;s serums, then I put this eye cream on. It makes my makeup look beautiful-- concealer, I mean, my eye shadows look smooth and blended, too. It&#x27;s amazing. I love this eye cream! I definitely recommend it! It lasts forever, too. A little bit goes a LONG WAY.</li>
    <li> ***Received this product for review, but all opinions remain true and honest*** I have dark circles under my eyes, which was my main reason for trying this product. I love the way this cream feels under my eyes especially at night. It gives my eyes a soothing feeling, and it smells really great. At first I thought it was going to be too creamy, but it absorbed very well. I love using this before bed, even though you can use morning and/or night.</li>
    <li> Good. My wife love it.</li>
    <li> Nice product, good consistency, but does it remove wrinkles and puffiness? Of course not. None of them do.</li>
    <li> This product works better than any of the many, many eye creams I have bought over the years. The only drawback for me is that it does have a  rather strong scent, not unpleasant in any way, but I generally prefer unscented products.  Perhaps it&#x27;s not possible to make this unscented because of the botanicals that are part of its effectiveness (although I believe that fragrance is one of the ingredients).  The scent reminds me of tea tree oil and lavender.  Although I have sensitive skin, it does not irritate my skin in any way. Love it and would buy it again!</li>
    <li> The packaging was different than what was pictured. I&#x27;ve been looking for a cream like this. As a busy mom with young kids I have to fight to look more awake and not worn out... The cream was well packaged and I had to pump it about 8 times to get it to come out. I really like that it&#x27;s in a pump, it makes it easier for me to get a small amount. I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;ll work when I&#x27;m getting to the end of it, but hopefully I&#x27;ll get every last drop cause this stuff is AMAZING. My skin is sensitive and when I&#x27;ve used other products for my eyes in the past it either makes my eyes red or they kinda burn and water. Not with this. I was a little worried with the long list of ingredients, but it&#x27;s a lot of organic natural oils and my eyes like it. The cream has a pleasant organic smell to it, and I really like that as well. I should&#x27;ve taken a before picture because even though it hasn&#x27;t been a very long time of me using it I am noticing a difference.</li>
    <li> I have nothing but praises for this product. I usually apply it daily after my evening bath and it feels sooo good on my skin. I&#x27;ve also been getting complements that I&#x27;ve been glowing, so maybe it does work! But I really haven&#x27;t had a skin care routine before this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product and would repurchase in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream.  It has reduced and softened some of my wrinkles around the eye area.  It feels really nice and it absorbs quickly.  Do not irritate my eye area. My skin around my eyes look moisturized and no dry.  I like this cream.</li>
    <li> Since using this my lines and bags are gone</li>
    <li> Works great. I used to have dark circles not anymore! Everyone has complimented, asking if I&#x27;m getting more sleep. I have told many to try this product its awesome!</li>
    <li> The BEST eye cream I have ever used. Visual results in crow feet area and reduced my black under eye circles as it says it does.  I will be purchasing lots more!!!  Very awesome product.</li>
    <li> I really, really liked this stuff...a lot. The only thing that is keeping me from using it is every time that I apply it, I start sneezing. I still use it every once in a while, but I have had to lay off. I&#x27;m wondering if that would be the &amp;#34;nut-allergy&amp;#34; part??</li>
    <li> cooling and doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive eyes. it definitely helps with puffiness and dark circles. Can&#x27;t tell if it is helping with the wrinkles</li>
    <li> could not get past smell to even use this</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the same bottle as in the picture...A little goes a long way, and I have seen it help a bit with my dark circles. However! This cream burns my eyes terribly. If your clumsy like me and forget you put it under your eyes and rub your eyes, you will regret it.&lt;br /&gt;I have also noticed after continuous use of this stuff makes the skin around my eyes more sensitive. The skin becomes more raised. This prevents me from applying any makeup to these areas because touching or rubbing the area around my eyes hurts. It has affected the waterline of my eyelids and now those areas have become sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;I know that sounds terrible, but that isn&#x27;t a huge downside for me. I started using this product frequently during the drier nights and mostly on the upper parts of my eyelids. It solved my problem with my stupidity of rubbing my eyes after applying this stuff. It really calms down my skin and leaves my eyes refreshed in the morning. I stopped using it every night, and it has stopped irritating my eyes. Best of all it is cheap, so if it doesn&#x27;t work out for you, at least you aren&#x27;t breaking the bank.</li>
