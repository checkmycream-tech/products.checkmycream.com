      <li>It&#x27;s def worth it.</li>
      <li>This product is great for those who are currently wearing their hair naturally.</li>
      <li>It does not use up fast and it is also good for moisturizing the entire body.</li>
      <li>The Strong Roots Red Pimiento Hair Growth Oil is strong scented</li>
      <li>I use the strong roots as part of my pre-shampoo routine (strong roots on the scalp + extra virgin olive oil + coconut oil on the hair + a shower cap + 20 to 60 mins).</li>
      <li>A lot of people recommend this product so hopefully they are right.</li>
      <li>your not doin it right</li>
      <li>i will have to use more of this product to really give a good fed back only been using for a couple of weeks</li>
      <li>but hopefully it will only help my hair even more.</li>
      <li>This is my first time trying JBCO</li>
      <li>First, what has worked for a lot of you may not work for everyone.  </li>
      <li>but I returned the products and ordered from the company I first got this from.  </li>
      <li>This is always a winner especially if you have dry scalp, it works great</li>
      <li>the pimento oil will last a good while I did just order a larger bottle of castor oil to hold me over for awhile</li>
      <li>The JBCO makes my hair super soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>I had my thyroid checked and everything came back fine.  </li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed much growth yet from the pimento oil</li>
      <li>Really dont see a difference in hair growth.</li>
      <li>My daughter was diagnosed with seborrhea of the scalp, and the red pimento worked wonders for her scalp, and her bald spots filled in too.</li>
      <li>My hair really like it as a sealant.</li>
      <li>I received it earlier than it said so that was great , I&#x27;ve used it only once but will get back to you on how it comes out</li>
      <li>Came fast.</li>
      <li>The castor oil, eh, not so much.</li>
      <li>My hair grew so much faster.with the growth oil.</li>
      <li>really anything that I thought would help.  </li>
      <li>my hair has grown SO much since i started using.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve referred this pairing to approximately 6 other customers, and they all love it.  </li>
      <li>gives a nice glow to hair after shampoo use the pimento oil as a condationer and the black castor oil on hair after i wash the pimento out leaves hair soft</li>
      <li>This is (in my opinion) a decent price for this combination.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend....</li>
      <li>Super, super messy.  </li>
      <li>This oil was clear and had a much milder smell.  </li>
      <li>I chopped all my hair off into a short cut since I wanted to start over fresh</li>
      <li>and then it would improve  (kind of the Kalteen bar mentality from Mean Girls).  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without this product</li>
      <li>I have a very sensitive scalp, and this clears up any aggravated areas.</li>
      <li>but it makes my super thick and color treated hair super soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>The Jamaican Black Castor Oil is not particularly dark, but it does not have a strong smell at all.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to give this product any stars, but we all know how this works.  First, what has worked for a lot of you may not work for everyone.  I have very thick, curly hair that had not shown any signs of damage, excessive shedding, or thinning.  I get a lot of compliments on my hair so I want to take preventative measures to keep it healthy.  After using this product, I began pulling tons of hair out.  I was stunned since I don&#x27;t dye/use a flat iron/blow dryer/or other heat products.  I thought that maybe this was something that was supposed to happen and then it would improve  (kind of the Kalteen bar mentality from Mean Girls).  Anyways, three months ago there was massive damage and it was embarrassing.  My hairdresser kept telling me it was a good thing I had so much hair to start with since I had lost so much.  I began taking Biotin and Niacin--really anything that I thought would help.  I had my thyroid checked and everything came back fine.  Then, I was recommended to a dermatologist who asked if I had recently been prescribed medications, such as birth control or antidepressants.  I said no.  She asked if there were any changes to my health care regimen or grooming.  I mentioned the pimento oil.  She advised me to stop using it immediately (to see if there was a noticeable difference without it) and maybe in an additional three months it might be reversed.  Try one month.  Weeks after I stopped using this product, my edges grew back and the follicles on my scalp thickened.  I chopped all my hair off into a short cut since I wanted to start over fresh/make my hair look thicker.  It is thicker now and I will never use this product again.  It made me angry that the company said it doesn&#x27;t cause hair loss, because I was shedding excessively.  My hair is not shedding now and I&#x27;ve tried better products.  The smell never bothered me; I was actually in the minority of people who liked the smell.  However, it is thick and doesn&#x27;t apply well.  My hair looked greasy, but the curls were smoother.  I&#x27;m happy most people did not have this experience, but it was a nightmare for me., but the curls were smoother.  I&#x27;m happy most people did not have this experience, but it was a nightmare for me.</li>
    <li> I m still trying this products hopefully it will grow my hair back. A lot of people recommend this product so hopefully they are right.</li>
    <li> Love the way my hair is looking and feeling. Great products.</li>
    <li> oh my goodness i love it!! my hair has grown SO much since i started using.  about every third day, i massage it into my scalp for about 5 minutes.  then i hit it with a blow dryer on low for 20 minutes and then wash.  stuff is great.</li>
    <li> The red pimento smells great. The castor oil, eh, not so much. Just started using it. Instantly softened my locs. Will update in a couple of months about hair growth.</li>
    <li> This castor oil is a staple in my hair care regime. I only use natural products. This oil helps my hair hold moisture and it thickens it. I gave a bottle to my niece and she called me and said that her hair was too thick to comb, lol. So it works. If you have AA natural hair and want to regrow your edges or just thicken your hair this is something you need to keep in stock.</li>
    <li> Just started using this on my eye brows, lashes and roots and I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference with the brows and lashes in thickness and length. I believe it&#x27;s too soon to tell for my hair but it makes my super thick and color treated hair super soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> The smell could be better but the product is amazing</li>
    <li> Love this product, it makes your hair soft, moisturized and grow. definitely recommend for anyone who has dry, natural hair trying to grow it out.</li>
    <li> The oil spilled all over my order :( it damaged my other items I purchased everything is all greasy and with an ugly sme.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb women you must try it and if you say it don&#x27;t work well then your not doin it right cause it works  wonders for me and my daughter...thanks..5 stars..love it..</li>
    <li> This stuff could grow hair on a rock!</li>
    <li> Did improve with the growth of my hair. It also gave my hair volume and thickness. I will continue using</li>
    <li> I used this and until today I still have some and found that the Black Castor Oil is heavy and doesn&#x27;t have a scent so, when being applied, really watch out not to over do it. The Strong Roots Red Pimiento Hair Growth Oil is strong scented which doesn&#x27;t last long but I always applied at night to avoid the scent being present in the morning. If I would maintain using it, I know it would be better! It may have been working to help grow my hair but only time would tell if I remain using such.</li>
    <li> will be ordering more</li>
    <li> A friend recommended that I use this product.  I will say that after a month I have noticed a change and my hair is starting to grow back.  No longer do I have to worry about my hair thinning but it is coming back naturally.  This product works for sure!!!!!</li>
    <li> gives a nice glow to hair after shampoo use the pimento oil as a condationer and the black castor oil on hair after i wash the pimento out leaves hair soft</li>
    <li> i was told that my hair was soft but im not sure if it&#x27;s grown some one said it did but I didn&#x27;t see it</li>
    <li> love it almost out I&#x27;ve been using on my and my daughter hair and our hair is growing like crazy</li>
    <li> It made my eyelashes grow!! I use it every night.  It is easy to use and works great.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great i will  buy  it again.</li>
    <li> Amazing results! I noticed a remarkable difference in not only the thickness of my hair, but the growth was measurable as well. Highly recommend....please note that the Castor Oil had a bit of a cigarette ash smell, but it wasn&#x27;t so bad that it discouraged me from using it.</li>
    <li> I have course 4C hair and chopped off all my perm , so far my hair seems to be filliing in , in the lighter areas and growing back slowly so no complaints. will update my review after a few more months of use but so far so good!</li>
    <li> Really dont see a difference in hair growth.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, every thing I have been hearing. I would recommend to my family and friends. Thx U Tropic Isle!!</li>
    <li> The peppermint oil was too strong and unfortunately, it Damaged my hair.  The Jamaican black castor oil is really good and serves well for many purposes, especially my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve referred this pairing to approximately 6 other customers, and they all love it.  My sister&#x27;s hair began to grow back when utilizing the oil with red pimento, and she was diagnosed with alopecia.  My daughter was diagnosed with seborrhea of the scalp, and the red pimento worked wonders for her scalp, and her bald spots filled in too.</li>
    <li> This stuff is definatly not a waist of time or money. My hair grew so much faster.with the growth oil. It doesnt smell too good but its effective if you are consistantly using it. And the castor oil makes ur hair soooo soft but remember a little goes.a long way. I will be purchasing again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I like it, keeps my daughters hair moisturized vs it looking dry all the time. It&#x27;s like I couldn&#x27;t find anything to us on her hair to make it not soak up anything I put on it and this stuff works. It kept it&#x27;s shine and looked even more healthy.</li>
    <li> I received it earlier than it said so that was great , I&#x27;ve used it only once but will get back to you on how it comes out hope it makes many hair grow</li>
    <li> This product is great for those who are currently wearing their hair naturally. I usually use a palm amount in my hair right before I shampoo, giving it the moisture that natural hair needs after a wash. It does not use up fast and it is also good for moisturizing the entire body.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a month now for my daughter&#x27;s hair. I&#x27;ve noticed that her hair is less dry and more managable. It also gives her hair a nice sheen to it. With daily use, Im hoping to see more growth! So far so good!</li>
    <li> I purchased these items to help my hairline grow back. My edges were thinning and nothing else seemed to work. After using solely the black castor oil every night for about a month I saw some growth! Even my hairdresser noticed that my edges were starting to grow in. I have not used the pimento hair oil just yet but hopefully it will only help my hair even more.</li>
    <li> A must have for delicate edges! I found agroup of women on youtube participating in a castor oil challenge So Im joining in.</li>
    <li> I will always use the Jamaican Black Castor Oil but the Red Pimento Hair Growth oil is very strong smelling and does not do anything other than oil your hair. In my opinion its a waste of money. I will just order two bottlles of the Jamaican Black Castor Oil instead.</li>
    <li> Have only been using for a short time so I can&#x27;t give an honest review of how its going to work.</li>
    <li> Came fast. Great products</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what I thought it would.  Super, super messy.  I didn&#x27;t get the growth results but everyone is different. It might work well for others.  Just didn&#x27;t work out for me.  However, quality, shipping and everything else was as promised.  I took a chance on the wrong thing for me.  Not the sellers problem.</li>
    <li> Received on time and in good condition. Wasn&#x27;t for me, but my girlfriend seemed pleased and enjoyed the product. No complaints to report.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with the results. I totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Use them both to promote hair growth.</li>
    <li> Did some research to find a product to repair my hair that had grown alot over the past year due to different braids styles but my edges thinned out during that time. I&#x27;ve been using these products for a month now and I c my edges are coming in beautifully the pimento oil will last a good while I did just order a larger bottle of castor oil to hold me over for awhile</li>
    <li> It arrived on time. I have only tried the one product and it very think and I would think you have to sit in the dry for the ease of application but I do have the time for that. It have about three days no smell but moist.</li>
    <li> Used product daily for a month and saw no changes....</li>
    <li> Love these and the smell is strong but it doesn&#x27;t bother me, reminds me of home</li>
    <li> This is (in my opinion) a decent price for this combination. I use the strong roots as part of my pre-shampoo routine (strong roots on the scalp + extra virgin olive oil + coconut oil on the hair + a shower cap + 20 to 60 mins). I have a very sensitive scalp, and this clears up any aggravated areas. The Jamaican Black Castor Oil is not particularly dark, but it does not have a strong smell at all. I am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have fine blonde hair, these oils have helped my hair grow faster and there seems to be more of it. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Great stuff helps my dreads grow even longer. Thank</li>
    <li> This is always a winner especially if you have dry scalp, it works great</li>
    <li> I love these products.  The oils are thick and moisturizing.  I use the red pimento 1-2 per week and the castor oil before a wash.  My hair feels so soft and my curls are so shiny.  Love this.</li>
    <li> Good product. Great for dreads because the oil doesn&#x27;t drip.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s rare that I actually find a product that works, especially when it comes to my hair. This is some good stuff.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell good but it feels great, and keeps my hair soft and moisturized. I would definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> Great productsuse it all the time...had to get more!</li>
    <li> love it...dont need Gel anymore.</li>
    <li> The JBCO makes my hair super soft and manageable. The red pimento oil does stimulate growth and I&#x27;m transitioning and def seeing the results. It&#x27;s def worth it.</li>
    <li> This product has exceeded my expectations and I will be purchasing this again. I could see the results in 2 weeks and I stareted using the product on my daughters hair and she can see a differece also.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I may purchase it again.  It is very thick and last a long time.  My hair really like it as a sealant.</li>
    <li> i use this all the time. i like the added smell of the pimento oil.  i can&#x27;t tell the difference yet but i keep my hair in protective styles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years and I love the results it yield.  My edges are stronger and my scalp lubricated for massaging.</li>
    <li> Great price for the combination package provided. This is my 2nd order of the African castor oil. I usually use it to rub on my edges to prevent breakage. My edges have become fuller because of this product. Oil is pretty thick so I usually don&#x27;t have to use very much so one bottle lasts me a very long time, at least a year and half</li>
    <li> feels good on an itchy scalp for those with dry hair adds luster</li>
    <li> Must buy if you&#x27;re into hot oil treatments!</li>
    <li> I really like this product i think next time i will order a bigger bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product on my hair and my daughter i will have to use more of this product to really give a good fed back only been using for a couple of weeks</li>
    <li> I love the caster oil it&#x27;s so thick and I love using it on my ends and my nails too. Haven&#x27;t noticed much growth yet from the pimento oil but I&#x27;m am going to keep using it.</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying JBCO and it was OK but it&#x27;s very thick and the smell is a little strong. So when buying this you should mixed it a less thick oil like coconut, grape seed or any type of oil. I&#x27;M also not too sure if it&#x27;s making my hair bc my hair grows at such a slow rate so I&#x27;ll continue to use to see</li>
    <li> Very rich love it on my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
    <li> I have only been using these product for two weeks and my hair has defiantly begin showing some improvements.  For example,my hair has less shedding ( which was my biggest concern). I put a little on my hair every other day at night before I wrap it for bed and when i wake up my hair is smooth and manageable. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time and as advertised!</li>
    <li> does not work peace of junk</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product in the past.  What I received was not the same as what I have left in my almost empty bottles at home.  The red pimento hair growth oil should have a slightly red hue and a definite smell of red pimento.  This oil was clear and had a much milder smell.  Maybe this is better for some people but I returned the products and ordered from the company I first got this from.  Shipping was more expensive but I&#x27;m sure to get the right product.</li>
    <li> this is great stuff,will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Been using for a few months. Some hair growth of my hairline but not spectacular.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve not seen results, But i don&#x27;t expect  the same results for everybody</li>
