### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The Nail art pen is great to use.</li>
      <li>Great nail art pens for a gift or yourself.</li>
      <li>No option to choose color: once again, leading me to think I was getting more than one.</li>
      <li>but without trying it I cannot be 100% sure since it does not state the color anywhere on the packaging or pen itself.</li>
      <li>Easter gift for granddaughter, she will love it.</li>
      <li>I should have put a top coat on it.</li>
      <li>but I thought I was going to get more than one pen.</li>
      <li>Not at all pleased.</li>
      <li>Teens will love these.</li>
      <li>The picture is misleading; I thought I was getting more than one.</li>
      <li>Glad I am not colorblind.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just noticed it says 1PCS in the description, which I originally read as 12PCS;</li>
      <li>Overall, good product for the price.</li>
      <li>What a rip off, you pay that much money for one pen and it doesn&#x27;t even work that well!</li>
      <li>more only got one they chose the color price</li>
      <li>but again I have ordered from quite a few companies in China and have received good merchandise for a low price and have been satisfied overall with my orders....</li>
      <li>Very unsatisfying and when i did get it, it didn&#x27;t even work.</li>
      <li>I really like the tip on this pen.  </li>
      <li>However, it started to rub off after not quite a whole day.  </li>
      <li>Will be getting more of the other colors to try.</li>
      <li>Luckily I received a white one.</li>
      <li>They can be used on many different types of polishes and they dry fast.</li>
      <li>they can&#x27;t even mail you the right amount of product you purchase bought two months ago only got one of twelve crappy!</li>
      <li>I would like my money back, thankyou very much, since it doesn&#x27;t even work.</li>
      <li>I GOT WHITE AS THE COLOR, FIRST DISSAPPOINTMENT</li>
      <li>Just be aware while in the middle of a design.</li>
      <li>EVEN AFTER PUTTING A CLEAR COAT OVER IT.</li>
      <li>The product description leads you to blieve you will get the complete set of pens pictured.</li>
      <li>It came early</li>
      <li>I was expecting exactly what the picture shows, but what showed up was one white pen and one yellow.  </li>
      <li>Plus the description and the picture on this product is deceptive because first of all, if you don&#x27;t read carefully it looks like the offer is for 12 assorted color pens for that low price</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy and can do many different thick or thin lines and dots.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s white and barely works.</li>
      <li>I would give them a 5 star rating however, they tend to clog and dry out if not used frequently.</li>

<li> but I have ordered things from China before and those actually arrived sooner than the approximate time given.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I waited a month for this thought it was going to be more only got one they chose the color price is rediculous for this. Do not buy this if i could give it 0 stars i would</li>
    <li> As others have noted, you get only one pen, NOT 12, and it is a random color.  Mine turned out to be . . . white.  Not at all pleased.</li>
    <li> I was expecting exactly what the picture shows, but what showed up was one white pen and one yellow.  Don&#x27;t buy this...you don&#x27;t get the set of six and you don&#x27;t get to choose your colors!</li>
    <li> Horrible product/company! The product description leads you to blieve you will get the complete set of pens pictured. I got a gold pen and I did&#x27;t even get to choose the color I wanted</li>
    <li> sucks not worth the money..let tjem</li>
    <li> Easter gift for granddaughter, she will love it.</li>
    <li> I really like the tip on this pen.  However, it started to rub off after not quite a whole day.  I should have put a top coat on it.</li>
    <li> Do not buy it only comes with one when it say 12 colors for the price of this I can buy 12 colors and they don&#x27;t even work there a waist of money</li>
    <li> I thought it  was going to be 12 pens but no it was just one ..I wish I would have read the reviews before I purchase this pen waste of money</li>
    <li> Be careful and read everything. When you read the title it makes it seem like you get one of each color. Plus there is no where to pick what color you want. You get whatever color they send you. Not happy!!!</li>
    <li> absolutely useless dont waste your money</li>
    <li> The Nail art pen is great to use. It&#x27;s easy and can do many different thick or thin lines and dots. Will be getting more of the other colors to try.</li>
    <li> Please! Read carefully before you buy it. It says 1 pen not 12 pens. So you only receive 1 pen and mine was white</li>
    <li> Wish I would have read the reviews.  Like others I thought I was getting a set of 12.  Luckily I received a white one.</li>
    <li> not happy! i got one pen.... it looks as if you should get 12 but you don&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> I should have read reviews. This is listed as a set of 12 nail art pens. I received 1 white pen. Don&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> I only received one pen which was of thier choosing of white. I thought you would get all 12 colors like it demonstrates in the picture and description of the product. Very unsatisfying and when i did get it, it didn&#x27;t even work. Don&#x27;t buy this product!</li>
    <li> I also waited quite a while for this order, almost one month.  I mean I understand it&#x27;s coming from China and all but I have ordered things from China before and those actually arrived sooner than the approximate time given.  Plus the description and the picture on this product is deceptive because first of all, if you don&#x27;t read carefully it looks like the offer is for 12 assorted color pens for that low price but IT&#x27;S ACTUALLY FOR JUST ONE PEN, (1PCS in the description) - however, there is no option to choose which color you want ( they chose purple for me, don&#x27;t know why purple but yeah)... but the worse part is that the pen looks nothing like the picture (the picture looks like different color Sharpie-type pens) but in reality what you get is just a plastic tube with a pointed part at the tip that you squeeze the paint out of. I understand it&#x27;s a low price but again I have ordered from quite a few companies in China and have received good merchandise for a low price and have been satisfied overall with my orders....but this one, very bad business...it&#x27;s too low of an amount to bother sending the pen back so I guess I&#x27;m stuck with it...but I repeat, don&#x27;t bother with this product/company.</li>
    <li> I read the other two bad reveiws and they at least got some similar to a pen ...I got a bottle of blue nail polish !  The headline for the item says 1 pc - 12 assorted colors which I assumed was 12 assorted colors.  Nope..it was just one blue bottle of nail polish.</li>
    <li> Completely disappointed by this product. I wouldn&#x27;t give it any stars if I could write a review withing having to put stars up.  I received black, directions on the package were misspelled and did not make sense. Total disappointment.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE AND DID NOT WORK JUST AWFUL</li>
    <li> It came early but I thought I was going to get more than one pen. I only got one and it was silver.</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed with this. Waited a long time which I understand since it&#x27;s coming from China but I got 1 not 12 pens. I want my money back, what a rip off.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  Waited about a month for one measly  pen. I noticed they fixed the false advertisement. When I made my purchase, I was under the impression that I was getting a variety pack..</li>
    <li> Misleading picture. Very disappointed daughter.</li>
    <li> Do NOT BUY!!!!!!! You get ONE pen and they choose the color for you. I just paid $4 for a tube of white out and its not even name brand.  So not worth it. !!  Save your $$!</li>
    <li> Deceiving order, I waited and waited and received 1 pen.  I thought it was 4.  Expensive for 1 pen</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like that it says you get 12 of them and you only get one</li>
    <li> First, I wish I would have read the reviews for this product like I usually do, but it was late at night and I order this with several other nail products for my teenage daughter for Christmas. That was back in November. I just received today Jan 7. I had to go back and look up my order because I did not even realize this was what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;First, the description is deceptive because I thought I ordered a set. Now that I have re-read the description I see it is only one. My mistake but still deceptive on the seller&#x27;s part.&lt;br /&gt;Second, The item I received was not even the same brand as listed. It is listed as an Evermarket, the brand I received is Wealth. I am assuming I got black based on the lid color, but without trying it I cannot be 100% sure since it does not state the color anywhere on the packaging or pen itself. Glad I am not colorblind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review and add how the item works once my daughter tries it.</li>
    <li> I waited a month for these 12 assorted color pens and i got 1 pen and its black this was a waste of money im very disappointed in this product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Not happy! Got 1 pen and it&#x27;s white and barely works. Don&#x27;t buy. Shouldn&#x27;t even get a star but it wouldn&#x27;t let me post without it</li>
    <li> I waited a whole month for this product to come, AND IT WAS ONLY ONE GREEN PEN. I would like my money back, thankyou very much, since it doesn&#x27;t even work.</li>
    <li> Great nail art pens for a gift or yourself. Teens will love these. They can be used on many different types of polishes and they dry fast. I would give them a 5 star rating however, they tend to clog and dry out if not used frequently. You can unclog by using toothpicks and dipping in acetone. Just be aware while in the middle of a design. Overall, good product for the price. I would purchase this again .</li>
    <li> When You see this you think your getting 12 colored pens but no it&#x27;s only one! What a rip off, you pay that much money for one pen and it doesn&#x27;t even work that well! I ordered this as a gift for my friends birthday because she lives to do nails. Her birthday was the 17th I order this on February 6 and it said my delivery would be here between February 10-13 it&#x27;s February 23rd way past my friends birthday and it arrived and is nothing but a disappointment!!! And the pen doesn&#x27;t even look like the picture it&#x27;s a black bottle and they don&#x27;t tell you what color you have either until you use it!</li>
    <li> I GOT WHITE AS THE COLOR, FIRST DISSAPPOINTMENT THEN THE COLOR CHIPS OFF THE SAME DAY EVEN AFTER PUTTING A CLEAR COAT OVER IT.</li>
    <li> The picture is misleading; I thought I was getting more than one. I just noticed it says 1PCS in the description, which I originally read as 12PCS; my mistake. If there was only one color, I should have at least been given the option to choose the color. No option to choose color: once again, leading me to think I was getting more than one. By the other reviews, it looks like we all got the white pen. This is possibly the worst thing that I have ever bought on Amazon. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Has a needle in the end of it not very easy to put back in just to put the cap back on don&#x27;t waste your money they can&#x27;t even mail you the right amount of product you purchase bought two months ago only got one of twelve crappy!</li>
    <li> Think I was getting 12 colors but got 1 white pen that don&#x27;t work. Please don&#x27;t buy.</li>
