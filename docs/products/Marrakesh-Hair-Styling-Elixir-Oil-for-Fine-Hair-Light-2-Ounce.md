    <li> My husband uses it on his hair after it is dry.  He claims it is the best styling product he has ever used.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for 3 years and so have my daughters.  Price was terrific especially when you compare it to the salon price.</li>
    <li> My stylist finnished my hair with this, and it made my hair super silky and shiney. I had to have it, so bought on Amazon. I will definitely be buying more when it runs out! Works great with my ceramic flattening iron!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Makes my hair so smooth and smells wonderful!! Would definitely repurchase! Great buy at a great price</li>
    <li> It lasts for about ever!  My only complaint would be in the packaging.  When it arrived it was wrapped in bubble pack in a box but wrap was saturated in the oil that leaked out.  With only 2 ounces at  that price, that is a huge loss.  I will by it from my salon from now own. They started carrying it when I raved about it.  I won&#x27;t have to worry about lost product in shipping.</li>
    <li> If used properly, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34; up your hair, but it shines things up quite nicely.  If I have slept wrong and caused my hair to look a bit frizzy, I just use a tiny bit of this rubbed first into my hands and then gently applied as I do my hair.  The frizzys disappear!  I&#x27;ve use it both on wet and dry hair successfully!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this Hair Oil. Consistency is much lighter than other products containing Argan oil and does not weigh your hair down. Does a great job of keeping your hair moisturized and protected from styling appliances. Definitely recommend this for those people who have normal to dry hair.</li>
    <li> It was for my wife.  She uses it to help style her hair.  Seems to work well.</li>
    <li> A really good product for thin hair.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down and it has a very light and pleasing scent.</li>
    <li> The Bubble wrapped product was totally soaked withe 2 0z of product.&lt;br /&gt;We promptly put it in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;Please send a replacement&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Bob Hasenstab&lt;br /&gt;BobsBusiness@gmail.com</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 years and just love it.  I do hot yoga now and it keeps my hair in great condition.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this all the time. I Found for almost half of what she pays at a hair salon.</li>
    <li> I use this for mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair. She has really curly hair and it has a tendency to rat up. This helps to make it easier to get through and keep from becoming a mess.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  This product rocks, by the way.  It makes my fine hair voluminous, and helps keep my style all day with no fly always.  Don&#x27;t use too much though - a little goes a long way....otherwise you&#x27;re left greasy.</li>
    <li> I have very silky straight hair. This oil actually helps it hold a curl plus it keeps my hair very healthy.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair so silky and smooth. I use it every single day and, it smells divine!</li>
    <li> Love it. Use it as a detangler on daughter&#x27;s hair after washing. As long as you don&#x27;t put too much it is not oily.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, it makes my hair soft and less frizzy at the ends!</li>
    <li> My sister gave me a bottle of this oil to try. I didn&#x27;t think I would like it because of my hair being so fine and thin.  After using it a few times...I loved it.  Like I mentioned, I have very fine thin hair and was very surprised it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  It makes it feel so much softer...but not to the point I can&#x27;t do anything with it.  It also makes it look and feel like it&#x27;s in a lot better condition.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for almost a year.  If I run out or sometimes forget to use it, I can tell a difference in my hair.  I may be wrong but I actually think it&#x27;s made my hair a little bit thicker.  I think it&#x27;s probably good for the scalp as well.  I put it on each time after I shampoo my hair.  If I workout a lot, I still put it on after each shampooing.  I only use a small amount but it never makes it look oily or greasy.</li>
