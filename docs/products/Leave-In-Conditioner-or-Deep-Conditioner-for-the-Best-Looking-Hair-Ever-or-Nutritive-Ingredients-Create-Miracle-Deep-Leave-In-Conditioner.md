      <li>but oh my! am I ever so glad that I did spend that money coz the minute I put this conditioner on my scalp and hair,</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not greasy at all. Smells like herbal tea. GIANT tub so it&#x27;s worth the money. Left my fried ends looking pretty healthy. Love this product line. Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using it just for a week now. It is smooth  easy to apply no residue I can only say it does need to be reapplied next day. My hair is very dry though so the next day I just need a touch up. So far the best leave in I had!</li>
    <li> My hair is usually very dry and I have to condition it well before and after I shower. However, this is the one conditioner I can miss a few steps with because it does its job so well.</li>
    <li> Best item found so far for dry hair from product.</li>
    <li> I have both low and high porosity hair.  Low porosity when no product is in it, high porosity when I have a plethora of product in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone said it&#x27;s not possible to have both but it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I wash and air dry my hair it is severely straw dry, brittle, and hard to brush.  I heard that doing a baking soda rinse and a apple cider vinegar rinse afterwards will help with low porositic(I know that&#x27;s not a word) hair but my hair is so damaged from brushing while it&#x27;s dry putting baking soda in it might make my hair even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair doesn&#x27;t do good with anything I put in it after a wash and dry.  Since this was natural and it claimed it provides all the moisture one needs and the good reviews confirmed it I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I washed my hair I put this on.  It&#x27;s hard to describe the consistency of this product.  It&#x27;s not thick but when I put it on it felt...I can&#x27;t describe it.  All I know is every time I scratched my head I would have the product on my hands and it felt...jelly-ish?  It was hard to rinse off my skin.&lt;br /&gt;When my hair was completely air dried it was like I put nothing in it.  It even left nice little white flakes when I went to re-wet my hair in order to put two strand twists in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a big tub of this and a lot of other so-called moisturizing products for my mainly low porosity head.  Until I can find something that won&#x27;t leave my hair straw dry after a wash and air dry I&#x27;m stuck with using this.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! It makes your hair feel like butter! Nor is it greasy.</li>
    <li> Nice don&#x27;t have to buy a oil with this one can do styles with this</li>
    <li> Love it but could smell better!!</li>
    <li> The first time I used this I put in way to much and it never dried. I had to re wet and towel it out of my hair. I didn&#x27;t realize how long a little way goes. I decided to give a try again using less and loved it. I was also using it as a deep conditioner leaving it on my hair overnight. Awesome results. Smells nice, very moisturizing. I&#x27;m black with natural hair and this worked very well for my hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter is mixed African-American&amp;Hispanic. Her curls are very tight and kinky. I&#x27;ve tried many products on her hair from over the counter to all natural and organic and nothing seemed to work well. I was hesitant to buy this product but I&#x27;m so glad I did! It helped so much with the frizz and kept her curls in tacked! I&#x27;m just WOWED! The product doesn&#x27;t have much smell to it but I added a few drops of a scented oil. I&#x27;m so happy I bought it and I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> When I initially wrote my review I stated that it was too heavy to use as a leave in conditioner and that it needed to be rinsed out but I realize that I was using too much.  You have to be very stingy with it and if your hair is baby fine AND curly, like mine, you still may want to gently pass a little water over it to clean off the excess.  Now that I have used it more frequently I love it.  I find that to avoid washing my hair daily I can simply rinse it with water and apply just a little more Just Natural Leave In.  It dries beautiful and soft.  My daughter, who also has curly hair, tried it and loves it as well.  How much you use will depend on the hair texture and trial and error.  But don&#x27;t give up.  Eventually you will find the right amount to use for your hair type.</li>
    <li> Seller was great and product seems pretty good so far. Very economic. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> My hair has always been dry but I am on antibiotics alot and my hair is damaged. I have only used this once as I just got it and my hair looks and feels great. I will continue to use this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I am a trained aromatherapist and for years made my own natural &amp; organic skin and hair care products since I had difficulty finding any that were made for very curly, African American and mixed heritage hair. I have tried most quality natural and organic curly hair products on the market, ranging from average priced to expensive. I am so happy I stumbled upon Just Natural products. They are the best on the market for curly hair. This leave on conditioner has a natural, light scent, makes your hair smooth and silky, all without harsh ingredients and chemicals. And don&#x27;t be fooled by the price. The $25.00 ($24 and some change) is for a large 16 ounce tub that has lasted me over 5 months, and I  have long curly hair.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews but felt I had to for this product. I am absolutely thrilled! I have 4b/4c LOW POROSITY natural hair. I&#x27;ve struggled to figure out how to manage my low porosity hair - it is consistently dry and struggles to retain moisture and therefore always and easily tangled. After researching ways to moisturize low porosity hair I did some searching and came across Just Natural Hair Care Leave-in Conditioner. I&#x27;ve used it for about a week now and am so happy with the results! So far I have only applied the conditioner to dry or slightly damp hair as low porosity hair is better able to absorb product in a dry/damp state. My hair feels so moisturized and soft, my curls are so supple and malleable, and when adding this product to my hair it&#x27;s like an instant detangler - I can finger detangle my strands with ease because the product gives my hair a lot of slip.  Low porosity hair can often feel weighed down by product because of its inability to easily and quickly absorb product. Just Natural Care Leave-in Conditioner does not weigh my hair down at all - my hair just drinks it up. The product also does not leave my hair feeling very oily. Instead, my hair feels soft and conditioned and looks shiny! And it has a very nice, light scent. I offer my highest recommendation.</li>
    <li> This product had my hair too greasy. Even after a few minutes when I applied it to my hair, my hair became back tangled. The only good thing is applying it to my roots, my hair grew to a length it normally does not grow to.</li>
    <li> I have natural 4a thick hair. I wanted to try this product because I am naturally attracted to everything naturalº&lt;br /&gt;I washed and deep conditioned my hair as usual and I parted it in 4 sections then applied this leave in using  a pea size per section on damp hair, from roots to end and combed through and it instantly melted into the shaft.&lt;br /&gt;First great impression: the smell. Fabulously fresh and faint smell. I threw away so many products because  of overpowering, overly sweet smells. Second great impression: no waxy feeling. I hate wax in products.&lt;br /&gt;I wear my hair elongated, meaning I blow dry it and twist and re-twist every night for a one week fresh style, this style is easy for me: no tangles&#x3D; no breakage &#x3D; length retention. So I cannot tell you how this product for wash and go&amp;iexcl;¦s because I am not a fan of wetting my head all the time.&lt;br /&gt;I blew dried after applying this leave-in. Result:  soft, silky, plumped up and especially non-greasy but fully moisturized  hair, and I could feel that there was full protection against the heat, although I keep it to medium. The result was a  full and glistening mane of hair I had never achieved before when I was using CD hair milk. CD hail milk did smooth my hair but in an oily way. This is waaaay better. I twisted my hair and did my twist out the next day. My hair was still felt full and glistening, with tons of volume, absolutely no dry feeling&amp;iexcl;K.and absolutely no build up.&lt;br /&gt;Now, another great part: the humidity shield is real. Some products are great but as soon as you get some place humid , your hair  becomes a puffy mess. I am in the middle of the rainy season: I noticed no significant puffing or shrinkage in my twist out.&lt;br /&gt;When I first t received it, I tried this leave in on a small section of my dry hair and it made absolutely no difference. I believe this is really meant for wet/damp her. So I stick to  a few drops my DIY oil mix for daily maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: This product is worth EVERY penny for me, especially that a little goes a long way and it comes in such a generous quantity. NOW: JUST BECAUSE WE SAY SO DOESNT MEAN THE PRICE HAS TO START SKY ROCKETING as often when a product gets very good reviews on Amazon. I hope it stays the same, that the company just leaves it as it is and doesn&amp;iexcl;¦t try to change the formula or the fragrance as they unfortunately do sometimes. Great work,  Justnatural,  keep it that way!</li>
    <li> Finally!!! Something that works with my hair-type: Dry, wavy dark hair. I am Puerto Rican, so most conditioners made for straight oily/combo hair never worked well for me, so I decided to try hair care products aimed at those of African heritage and I&#x27;ve been quite surprised at the results; some mixed though. They work best for my hair type but some just are too heavy and way my hair down; some even dry it out (Shea Moisture Leave-In, for example).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for something I could leave-in as I NEED the extra moisture (even if it leaves a bit of sheen) and this product is it! It&#x27;s chock full of botanicals and oils; which my hair needs. I was specifically looking for a product that did NOT contain Shea (as I seem to not have good results with it; maybe others do?) and this does not contain it and makes my hair look great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days but I will update it if my results change. So far, so good. Thank you Just Natural Hair!!!</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from a waver by the youtube name os stlwaver314. He always brought up this product about how it leaves your hair soft manageable and healthy. So I gave it a shot. And I must say this is a great product. If you want something that&#x27;s all natural &amp; also good for your hair this is it. If you have 360 waves this will not disappoint will make your hair curl up really nice</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have curly hair and tried all kinds of products that my hair was so damaged. I was desperate to try anything. I have been using this product for 3 weeks. So Far this is the product I have longed for. It leaves my hair looking shiny and healthy. I have also tried it for couple of days in the humid, so far it has been excellent!!!! I love that it is natural and very light on my hair. Thank you and thank you. I also have ordered couple of other products from the seller. I have not tried them but will review them once used for couple of weeks!!!</li>
    <li> see my other review for the shampoo.  NOT GREASY, SOFTENING, you don&#x27;t need to use too much. It doesn&#x27;t buildup on my hair. Ditto!</li>
    <li> I like the use of this product, I was very pleased with the results. The conditioner did just what the instructions on the lable said it would do.</li>
    <li> Smells weird, it&#x27;s ok, I found some other products I like better.  My daughter is mixed, black/white and this makes her hair fall flat.  I think it&#x27;s good for a deep conditioner for her but not to use daily.</li>
    <li> My 4c hair is often dry however, with this conditioner it allows my hair to really absorb moisture and helps to lay my cuticles down and create a smoother softer feel to my hair. Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It makes my hair mama gable even aft r working out. I am natural and my roots especially dry out after the gym but this softens it right back up.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair which is usually fly away and rough feel silky.  Don&#x27;t use much though or it will make your hair greasy.  Love it and will definitely order it again though it will take quite some time to use this jar up.</li>
    <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY, I FIND IT CALMING TO SEE IT SETTING THERE FOR WHEN MY HAIR GOES WILD.</li>
    <li> I stumbled on this while researching products for my 4c hair. My hair is responding well with the shampoo, conditioner and this leave-in because they are loaded with natural oils. I shampoo at the end of each week and do not co-wash during the week. I deep condition my hair well with coconut oil, plait hair, place a plastic cap on my head and a satin cap over that overnight. Next day, I detangle each plait and shampoo/condition. I use a small amount of leave-in to 2strand twist and seal the ends of each twist with a pinch of shea butter. I have low porosity hair, so this cream gets into the cuticles and my hair gets the moisture it needs. I don&#x27;t have to moisturize each and every day. It&#x27;s been 2 weeks and my hair is shiny, healthy and the curls are popping. I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
    <li> I have 3C/4A natural hair that is thick and extremely dry, so I am always looking to incorporate good products which promote moisture. It took me years to find a good regimen and a good product mix to retain moisture between washes. My routine and products were working so well I feared my hair would get used to what I was doing and would eventually be ineffective, and also I wanted a different summer product line/routine than what I use during the colder months. I decided to try the Just Natural Leave-In. The first time I used it, the product just seemed to sit on my hair and created little white balls when I applied my oil and styling product over it. The second time I used a clarifying shampoo thinking I did not get the desired results from the leave-in because of possible product build up. However the results were the same as the first time, with no product penetration and my hair extremely dry by the next day. I tried the Just Natural&#x27;s leave-in for a third time and noticed that my hair looked dull and I was experiencing severe breakage when I styled. I am not saying this product caused my hair to break, but that it does not provide enough moisture, nor does it penetrate my hair in order for the product to be effective, and this lack of moisture caused my hair to break. Thus, I would have to say overall I was not happy and will not be repurchasing in the future for myself. On a positive note, I gave this product to my mother who&#x27;s hair is less thick and course than my own, and she loves it for her wash and gos!</li>
    <li> I have thick coarse hair and it doesn&#x27;t do much by itself. After my hair dries, it&#x27;s back to the drawing board. :/</li>
    <li> Let me count the ways:  all natural, nutrition-packed ingredients with no plastics or preservatives?  count me in?  tames flyways, smooths hair, feels silky to the touch and going on.  Makes my hair look set and neat.  Reading other reviews, it might not work for all hair types, but it&#x27;s made for mine.  I have shoulder length, thick, wavy, hennaed hair.  It just drinks this stuff up and is in love with it, as am I.  And this company?  Love their dedication to be organic and natural, the packaging is beautiful, with their little recycled boxes and net bags and little scoops they include with it.  I also ordered the apple cider vinegar rinse for the hair, and in the package they included an extremely generous &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; size of their delicious eye cream.  Very cool, I&#x27;ll take it !  It will last me a good long while, and on another note, I love that too !  I&#x27;m 46, and anything that can make the skin around my eyes look smoother, brighter and moisturized is a good thing.  Love this company and their products.  I know it&#x27;s a little on the expensive side, but the care and quality going into their products is not cheap !</li>
    <li> I was using Brylcreem for a long time and was hoping to replace it with something more natural as I wasn&#x27;t particularly fond of getting cancer etc. due to all the unnecessary chemicals present in such products. I have tried a number of so called natural leave-in conditioners but nothing came close to this. I think I will buy this product for the rest of my life. Thanks for making this product!!</li>
    <li> A very, very little goes a long ways. Leaves hair greasy. I apply it at night and wash it out in the morning. For me, that works best.</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time and I&#x27;m blown away. I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this forever!  I&#x27;ve tried them all. Literally - my hair has never looked better than it does right now after using this once. It gave my hair shine, calmed down the excess waves, softened any frizzies and made my hair look extremely healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is wonderful - sold!!!!  Yea!</li>
    <li> It is so nice to blow dry your hair, and when you wash you hair again seems to be softer and with a healthier look.  The ingredients are the best for your hair I used it 1-2 times per week and the other days Joico Leave-In Detangler.  I wash my hair almost everyday or every other day.</li>
    <li> I have thick dry/damage wavy shoulder length hair. When I was younger I use to have beautiful manageable waves. I use to get so many compliments on my hair alias those days seem to be gone. I was born in Wisconsin and move to Puerto Rico when I was a teenager and my hair was not happy. It got dried, unruly, and burnt. I am a brunette and my hair naturally started to turn golden blonde. While the idea seems pretty and it was nice when the sun hit it, a golden sparkle that illuminated from my hair was at first really pretty. Unfortunately, that only lasted for awhile. It was not turning golden on its own it was being fried by the sun. My hair quickly started drying out and even smelled burnt! I was horrified. I chopped my hair many times but nothing seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Flash back a few years my hair is not burnt anymore but still dry/damage. I tried so many products I can open my own beauty supply store(might be a  good idea to earn back my MONEY!). I stumbled acrossed this leave in conditioner. I decided to give it a try. the first day I tried it I only used a little. I didn&#x27;t really see any results. I was ready to chalk it up to other iffy product to add to my ever growing collection. Then the following night I rinsed my hair and decided to use a lot more product,then I went to bed. The next day I woke up to smooth and shiny wavy hair ( I also sleep with a satin hair cap to keep the hair from getting tangled and frizzy). I was even able to brush it with a cushion brush without it getting puffy! I usually use my fingers or a wide tooth comb, but my hair looks best if I am able to brush it. I usually just brush my roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  However still felt paranoid that my hair may look greasy! Yikes! I asked my boyfriend and he said absolutely not. I guess it doesn&#x27;t look greasy I&#x27;m just not use to having shiny wavy hair, unless it was really greasy from other products. So I guess I am a bit skeptical, we will see how it will be next time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;  I do like it so far. My hair did look so much better the 2nd time I tried it. Try to use a little at first. If you don&#x27;t see any result try using a lot more especially on your ends, little less on your middle and, even less on your roots ( I need to put stuff on my roots too to look good). Keep experimenting to find what amount works good for you. Remember to have your hair wet or very damp. Also I recommended sleeping with a satin hair cap or satin pillow case. I find the sleeping cap does the best with my hair. I guess I am still in a little bit of denial; I am just use to things not working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I used the leave in conditioner again this time I try something a little different I used a hot oil treatment from Queen Helene in Jojoba. After the wash I wrapped my hair in a t-shirt for awhile like I always do for a few minutes (helps with frizz and forms the wave, NEVER dry your hair with a TOWEL!) Then I put my wet hair in my hair cap and went to bed. When I woke up I saw something I never saw before: Shiny, soft, smooth, bouncy wavy hair. OH My! I am not longer a skeptic. I am in love. Love my new combination. Finally found something that works.  :)</li>
    <li> a little too heavy for everyday</li>
    <li> Need some adjusting in amount to use.  Cannot use very much because makes my hair heavy.  Only need a small amount and I have shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> Big jar of product and it lasted for long,it is creamy and feels very nice,i really liked this conditioner,it does what it says,i have also used their shampoo,good ingredients,pleasant smell and texture,pretty packaging,it works for my thick,curly hair.If you have fine hair,maybe use just a tiny bit,but overall its good!</li>
    <li> I was exasperated with my skin and my hair!  I&#x27;m 52, with blonde (no visible grey yet) hair that is a bit coarse, medium thickness, chemically highlighted, curly unless i blow it out hair. (aka in my family:  \\&quot;non-petable hair\\&quot;)  I normally buy \\&quot;natural\\&quot; (organic, but i don&#x27;t get my readers out over the ingredient list) products for my hair and skin, but i have been known to try uber-expensive \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; stuff like Borghese, Origins, and I&#x27;ve gone nuts at Sephora more than a few times in what i THOUGHT was an endless search for a non-existent MIRACLE!  I feel the need to alternate hair products 2-3 x a week to keep anything acceptable going on and i have a giant \\&quot;plastic basket\\&quot; with a fortune&#x27;s worth of product.  I read the reviews of many of the Just Natural products one night and ordered a bunch of stuff... they have a great 30 day guarantee, and I was just desperate for a miracle line of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I FOUND IT!  I am the worst kind of gullible skeptic... so tell me what i want to hear and the credit card is typing itself on the screen or at the register of any Snooty-Toot department store, the local health care shop, or the newest display at my salan.  But, this stuff (i&#x27;m gonna go to their website also, and review the other stuff i bought- skin AND hair stuff) is seriously the best leave in conditioner EVER, or certainly that I have ever found.  I read about people saying they were tossing their other bottles of unused stuff because they were \\&quot;sold\\&quot; and they knew they would never use the drugstore brands, even the top lines, ever again after trying Just Natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is wonderful!  It is lightweight, but makes my hair supple and baby soft without losing the only good thing about it, really... the volume!  It smells great, and you get a huge container of it, so it is an absolute BARGAIN !!!!! a little really does go a long way, but even if you get enthusiastic and slather it, your hair will STILL work! I notice with all the itemsi purchased by JN, the packaging is simple, eco-friendly, and i know i am not paying for designer labels created by expensive artists and machines, or super model leaning bottles with embossed lettering, etc.  I have better things to do than hope my girlfriends peek in my shower and become envious about what kind of expensive stuff i use.  The leave-in has a delightful and very natural scent but not anything that will interfere with your fragrance.  Now, here is the BEST part!  After washing (and the vinegar rinse thing... well, i will go into details on the JN website so if you care to read more from an average menopausal lady who can use all the help she can get, look for my RAVING reviews on their site) anyway, after washing.. my hair already feels SO much better than with drugstore shampoos (talking their shampoo now) but i have so many options to keep my hair in good-hair-day status.  I can skip the regular conditioner (there are several formulas depending on your issues) and just use the leave-in for bouncy curls all day. i have that kind of \\&quot;animal\\&quot; hair that \\&quot;folds\\&quot; or creases when i sleep on it, and stands in multiple directions with no visible support -requiring a daily shampoo unless im having a lock-down day or a mental health day.  So, here is the greatest thing!  I can wash, and use just the leave-in, lightly blow dry (or not) and go to bed that night.  When i wake up (no, the bends and folds are still there, but...) i can just hop in the shower and run a little cool (or warm, whatever) water through it and i have even better hair than the day before!  The conditioner kind of \\&quot;reactivates\\&quot; and there is plenty of softness to go an entire &#x27;nother day --thus, not over-shampooing cuz i can&#x27;t go out \\&quot;the next day\\&quot;... ever. without starting over. (my daughter has the same hair, she calls it \\&quot;un-petable hair.\\&quot;  so does my son, and he calls it \\&quot;60&#x27;s doll hair.\\&quot;  you get the idea)  THIS WHOLE LINE IS ABSOLUTELY SUBLIME and i doubt i will EVER USE another hairor skin product again !  THANK YOU, Just Natural!  for your eco-conscious packaging, for your website, and mostly for making the BEST HAIR and SKIN PRODUCTS that i have found in 52 YEARS!</li>
    <li> I will keep this short and simple, my hair does not like this product.  I&#x27;ve tried using it different ways and the results are nothing worth bragging about.  It does not provide moisture or shine for my hair so I will not be using it anymore.</li>
    <li> I used this on my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair. We both have natural very dry hair. This is the best conditioner I have ever tried so far that offer any help with the dryness. I can&#x27;t say it will work for everyone because not every thing works for every one. I feel very lucky to have found this product because it&#x27;s a game changer for us. All I can say is give a try and hopefully you will see the same benefit as my daughter I.  I have stopped looking for a leave in conditioner because I have found one that really works great for us. You name it there&#x27;s a good chance I have tried it, from the so call best to Walgreen brands, and none of them compare in my opinion.  I bought my products from the Just Natural site and not Amazon.</li>
    <li> I want to like this...it makes my hair nice and soft and isn&#x27;t terribly heavy. But the back of my neck breaks out from it - and that never happens to me. Ever.</li>
    <li> Says leave in conditioner. I used very little and my hair looked greasy after I dried it. Had to wash it out</li>
    <li> Heard a lot of good things about this product but honestly not worth the price.  And comparing using the product and not using the product there is no difference in my hair.  It just smells funny.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is thick and coats the hair.  But not sticky.  You can tell the essential ingredients are being absorbed.  Great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Having used this for about a month, I have noticed a SERIOUS difference.  I use this along with the Just Natural Hair Loss Shampoo and Conditioner.  And when using this (along with Giovanni Hair Reconstructor - which I use for deep protein conditioning once a week) my hair feels healthy as it did when I paid a lot of money to my stylist.  Until my hair starts rejecting this stuff, I will keep this in my permanent rotation!</li>
    <li> I have a mix of white (I&#x27;m old LoL) and pale blond large-curled long hair. Very delicate hair but a lot of it, and I don&#x27;t wash daily, just condition and rinse. I&#x27;ve used this for about a week now. After my shower, I have applied this to my ends and it takes some getting used to. Too much and my hair feels gross and sorta sticky-like, but with the right amount applied and WOW it is soft!! This product is like using a gel to keep my curls defined. I would not use this if I hard straight hair, it would probably look greasy. The first few times I used it, it felt weird, but I think all the old build-up was working off. Now my hair feels nice, as long as I don&#x27;t apply too much. I would guess this will last me months, even with long hair. I give it 5 stares because even though some days I look like I have gross hair with something saturating it, most days it looks awesome and will help my ends stay soft. With curls, keeping your hair soft means great curl and length instead of fuzzier and breakage.</li>
    <li> Hello, I sure hope this review helps someone who is really trying to find that one conditioner that will actually do what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I am African American with type 4c hair and moisture is my problem..well lack of it anyways. I stumbled across this leave in while making a previous purchase from the same seller. I will admit, over the years trying to find that perfect product for my natural hair, I ended up becoming what others call a Product Junkie!!! lol. Anyway I decided to try this thing and I was a bit hesitant at first coz the price was a little spendy but oh my! am I ever so glad that I did spend that money coz the minute I put this conditioner on my scalp and hair, the softeness that prevailed is beyond my words. Also the itching I was experiencing from my castor oil, stopped almost in an instant!! this product is insane. If you are looking for a good moisturizer that&#x27;s not too heavy and smells super great, please please get this product. I am so happy I did and I wish I had discovered it sooner. Hope my review helps another natural out there that has the same issue I had with my hair before getting this conditioner. PS/ for extra growth and thickness, use it with Strong roots red pimento oil from Tropic of Isles. For some reason regular JBCO made my hair itch like crazy but the pimento oil did not and I use it to seal in the moisture from the leave in conditioner. Hope this helps someone. Good luck!!</li>
    <li> I tried this as an alternative to hair gel. I really like how you can understand the ingredient list, being all natural. I wish that the product made my hair feel more silky and smooth, but it is kind of pasty. I use it sometimes, but will look for something else eventually, as it is not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product but I&#x27;m not reallying noticing a difference.  I probably just need to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for a long time.  I like it because it is not too heavy and the ingredients are natural, no chemicals.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I have only used it for 1 month and it is comprable to my last leave-in conditioner. The smell is not bad either. I try to stay away from harmful chemicals in my hair products which is EXTREMELY hard to do. This is the first conditioner that I have encountered that actually is free of harmful chemicals. After a year, I will be able to really determine how well this stuff works</li>
    <li> I have extremely damaged bleached ends and this is the only product that allows my hair to feel healthy after I shower and look healthy after applying heat to it. I love it I can&#x27;t shower without it!</li>
    <li> i use this product on my hair before shampooing and leave it on for an hour or sometimes over night.  replace it after shampooing, and on the ends between shampooing to soften and detangle my hair. skipped the before shampoo ritual three times in a row and could tell the difference.  my hair was harder to untangle.  so back to my original three step ritual.  you don&#x27;t need to get close to the scalp with the product</li>
    <li> using this product for my 360 waves. I have course hair and this product really soften my hair, which is a rarity with people w/ course hair. Good, LIGHT moisture.</li>
    <li> This is my new staple leave-in conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed to find a replacement leave-in after \\&quot;Afro Detangler\\&quot; went out of business so I tried Kinky Curly&#x27;s but it wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough. I stumbled across this leave-in on Amazon and decided to try it out after reading such positive reviews. All I can say is \\&quot;Wow!\\&quot; I have been using it religiously since May 2014 and my hair absolutely loves it! I use it on freshly cleansed and deep-conditioned hair and I apply it in sections under my moisturizer and oil. My 4a hair is very moisturized and has limited frizz! I will continue to repurchase because it lasts a VERY long time! A little bit definitely goes a long way so I&#x27;m not upset about the price. It is worth it to me to have a product that lives up to its claims. I will only need to purchase this huge jar 1-2 times per year so $27 bucks for something that lasts this long is fine with me! Also, my friend that has type 2 hair loved it for her loose, fly-away prone curls so this isn&#x27;t just for \\&quot;African-American\\&quot; hair!</li>
    <li> I really, really wanted to love this product!  I have thin-ish hair, but it is frizzy and damaged.  But after putting just a little on my hair it was so greasy I had to wash it out of my hair.  I&#x27;m so disappointed!  If you have thicker hair or textured hair this might be the product for you!</li>
    <li> Truly I have the most coarse unruly curly unmanageable Caucasian hair - I need tons of product - I use this -- a TON of it, put it in after the shower, put in  more 10 min later, put in more 10 min later than dry - and I almost need NO other product - I use a little hair glosser from Aveda and it&#x27;s like magic.</li>
    <li> Products works great the shipping was late. But the free sample  was nice to  I would recommend it to anyone who wants  leave in conditioner that would not leave their hair greasy made with  organic  ingredients.</li>
    <li> It really works - I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> love the products I received from them, but this one simply didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.  makes my hair a little oily/sticky.  love their regular shampoo/conditioner though!  it&#x27;s the only thing keeping my hair in.</li>
    <li> This is the only hair care product i use.</li>
    <li> My origianal leave in conditioner just as good a this nothing special about this product will not purchase again.  made my hair stiff.</li>
    <li> I have very dry curly hair that has been very unruly most of my life (I&#x27;m 37).  I no longer need jell, which I have always needed.  This is sooooo much better.  My hair is soft and where most products would be to oily or make my hair stiff - this one is NOT!  I wish I would have found this sooner.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 days and the difference is amazing (not to mention the compliments). The amount you get is so worth the price.  I&#x27;ve purchased other leave-in conditioners that cost a fortune and I need so much of it that it would only last a week or two.  I would guess that this tub will last 3-4 months if not longer.  WONDERFUL!!!!</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry processed hair. I curl it (with a straightner ) every other day and color it about every 2-3 months. My hair is thick and a frizzy curly (without any styling or products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had seen this brand on Pintrest and decided to give it a try. I tried this product for the firs time on Saturday August 8th, I washed my hair and per the reviews I applied only about a quarter size amount to my damp hair. Once I applied it, I brushed my hair and slept on it wet. The conditioner is a bit thick, so you do not need to use very much. Again, I have thick hair and a quarter size amount worked perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my hair gets oily very easily, I only applied the product to the ends of my hair + this is where I see the most damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning my hair was dry and I proceeded to curl it like I normally do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed by the difference I saw on my hair from just 1 use!!! My hair was soft and I did not notice the split ends as much. My brother in law even complemented me on how nice my hair looked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this product and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed some of the reviews mentioned the smell could be better. I agree, however the smell is not unberable or strong enough to where it would keep me from using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the amount in the jar is enough to last me for at least a year!</li>
    <li> We have tried many products for my multi-racial daughter&#x27;s hair.  This is our favorite.  Many product contain scary chemicals, smell too artificial or too strong.  When I read the ingredients on justnatural&#x27;s label I thought, &amp;#34;hey! I could eat most of these!&amp;#34;  That made me feel the product was safe.  I also works better than any other product we&#x27;ve tried.  Never greasy or sticky.  We&#x27;ve used about six containers so far.  I have noticed some differences in the smell from batch to batch and the color changes a little bit.</li>
    <li> how does this have almost 5 starts?! this RUINED MY HAIR!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair was soft, manageable and shinny and i used to get SO many compliments UNTIL i started using this. I bought the conditioner first and then i got the shampoo and leave in conditioner to be fair and try them all. my hair is now SO DRY, UNMANAGEABLE, DULL I HATE IT. I&#x27;m seriously convinced that half of the people writing reviews here and on their website are people that are paid to do these types of things, thats why on Pinterest the only people promoting this line is &amp;#34;Just natural products&amp;#34; themselves and thats why there are not many good reviews on tumblr and youtube.&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is healthy already don&#x27;t bother. this is HORRIBLE.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for 360 waves, if your a male or female trying to get them, or looking for an all-natural product thats a good substitute for Pink lotion, or any other hair moisturizer. I&#x27;m a male with deep 360 waves, and one jar has lasted many months for me. (Using it about 2-3 times a week). its well worth the price, especially if you use it sparingly</li>
    <li> I wash my hair with baking soda and apple cider vinegar, then Turbie Twist it for about 20 minutes, then apply this Leave-in.  It&#x27;s amazing the condition of my hair afterward.  I don&#x27;t use anything else.  If I need to freshen my curls, I apply JustNatural&#x27;s refresher spray for hair and scalp and put a little bit more on the ends.  A little goes a long way!  It&#x27;s a great size jar for the price compared to the salon brands that claim to do the same thing but leave my scalp itchy and irritated.</li>
    <li> I use this in addition to the Thicker Hair shampoo by the same company. I have noticed less breakage and split ends. You don&#x27;t need a lot, I use about a nickel size for my mid-back length, thin to medium thick hair. My hair is shiny, thick, and stronger!!</li>
    <li> Very nice. I use this with the dry hair lotion and so far they seem to compliment each other. Would like to try more from this line.</li>
    <li> quality product for thick hair. styles and conditions leaving hair soft. Will make hair shiny and greasy until it completely dries however.</li>
    <li> A bit expensive,  but worth it because its all natural and healthy choice for hair. Not greasy and good choice to buy.</li>
    <li> So Good i even let my besty try out just to see how her curls would react. We are both natural though I color my hair medium ash blonde and she doesn&#x27;t. We both got wonderful results, i made a video showing how to use the product as well as what you can expect with your curl pattern https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;PSumWXxDpjM</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a month and it has made my hair stronger and slowed down the breakage.  I will be purchasing this product again soon.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have very think hair and this makes my hair so incredbily greasy, only used a small amount and I had to re wash my hair. I am going to use this a deep conditioning treatment instead of a leave in conditioner because its way to heavy to use it that way. I should have read the reviews more before buying. Now that I have it I will find a better way to use it, So i don&#x27;t have greasy hair. Would not buy again ... not worth the money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m natural and needed a thick leave in conditioner. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month. It did leave my hair soft but didn&#x27;t really work well with gel. The price is a little high. I may try making my own cream and if that doesn&#x27;t work ill definitely go back to this.</li>
    <li> I have long, grey hair and bought this product because I needed a natural, leave-in conditioner to use on our raft trip down the Grand Canyon.  I tried it a few days ago, using only a small amount and found it made my hair dull and heavy-feeling that just kind of hung on my head.  Today I tried it again but rinsed it out after using it...This time my hair is bouncy and shiney.  Having to rinse it out kind of defeats the purpose, but at least it works as a conditioner and I didn&#x27;t waste my money.  While I am on the raft trip, I won&#x27;t care if the hair looks dull, so it will work for that too.  But it isn&#x27;t LEAVE-IN, at least for my hair type.</li>
