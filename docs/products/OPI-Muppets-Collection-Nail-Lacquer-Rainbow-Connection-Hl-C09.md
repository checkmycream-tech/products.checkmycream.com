      <li>Just remember to leave a nice tip.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so sparkly, perfect for New Years and the Holidays!</li>
      <li>Delievered in time the produckt I ordered, and I got a mini \\&quot;seche vite\\&quot; with it, which was very cute and a nice surprise :)</li>
      <li>This is great holiday or special occasion nail polish.</li>
      <li>but I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sure the nail polish I received was authentic because it didn&#x27;t have an OPI serial number on it</li>
      <li>The glitter pieces are quite challenging to remove with nail polish remover.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll need to plan for extra time to scratch those beautiful sparkles off!</li>
      <li>This polish contains a lot of glitter which makes it cute but also time intensive to apply.</li>
      <li>I love glitter nail polish...call it a hangover from my childhood days, but I can&#x27;t stay away from the stuff.  </li>
      <li>Plus you want a top coat to set the glittery bits.</li>
      <li>I love this nail polish.  </li>
      <li>To get the pictured effect, you do need to apply more than one coat.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s just fantastic!</li>
      <li>I recieved so many compliments on this polish.</li>
      <li>I love this nail polish.  </li>
      <li>I love this polish.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lovely, but does chip easily.</li>
      <li>Shake it up really well to get a good distribution of glitter.</li>
      <li>This nail polish dries in a flash, so if you&#x27;re wanting to change your look from day to night, you can easily apply this polish over your day time one and add some sparkle to your look.</li>
      <li>It requires many coats, adequate drying time between coats, and tons of patience.</li>
      <li>would buy again from seller received rather quickly!</li>
      <li>The color is shimmery and not overdone, and it looks just fantastic with any outfit.</li>
      <li>So sparkley fun!  </li>
      <li>The only good thing about it is it dries quickly!</li>
      <li>The glitter is suspended in clear polish and it will take many coats (too many for me) to get a continuous glitter coat like what you see in the bottle.</li>
      <li>What I really liked about this product was that when the polish chipped, it wasn&#x27;t too obvious because of the many colors on my nails.</li>
      <li>but does need an undercoat or multiple coats to look good.</li>
      <li>The concept it cool</li>
      <li>I love OPI products and this is even radical for their line which is innovative and offers a huge amount of variety.&lt;br /&gt;Under normal circumstances I like polish that is easy to apply in one or two coats.</li>
      <li>Anyway, this polish is pleasantly deceiving because at first it looks like it should be a top coat, and I expected to have to apply 6 layers in order to achieve opacity.</li>
      <li>This item in the Muppets collection is colorful and so much fun!</li>
      <li>It dries quickly</li>
      <li>It is very pretty and use it all the time.</li>
      <li>I loved the way my nails looked, and it lasted a long time.</li>
      <li>I was in search for a fun glitter polish.</li>
      <li>It looks good layered over black.</li>
      <li>Glitter sizes and colors vary, but it looks very much like the photo.</li>
      <li>THIS POLISH IS REALLY PRETTY</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the different shades of glitter.</li>
      <li>By the time I chose to remove the polish, many of the larger pieces of glitter had flaked off.</li>
      <li>It is an exact duplicate.</li>
      <li>Very rainbow-y on just clear polish underneath, but also gorgeous over any solid nail color, because it is so very sparkly.</li>
      <li>Very feminine and a total must for this holiday season :)</li>
      <li>I pretty much had to scrape the glitter off one piece at a time.</li>
      <li>so they cover a large area.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t wear off very quickly and the color goes on really evenly with only 2-3 coats.</li>
      <li>Removing this polish is a huge pain, which is why I give only four stars.</li>
      <li>More trouble than its worth.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this I applied multiple coats to give the illusion of solid glitter on my nails, and while I was able to achieve this effect, this polish has large pieces of glitter which didn&#x27;t really like the layering and flaked off over the course of a couple of days.  </li>
      <li>will be purchasing more of this polish; the color goes w/everything, compliments are in abundance and the coverage is just what is expected of opi although this particular polish needs about three coats to get the coverage in the picture.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect the texture to be perfectly smooth - the hexagonal glitter will stick out in some areas and there&#x27;s no way to avoid this unless your nails are completely flat.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sort of like Times Square on New Year&#x27;s Eve in a bottle.  </li>
      <li>The colors didn&#x27;t fade like they do on most other metallic glitter polishes, especially if you wash your hands a lot.</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;ve tried silver underneath, and fuchsia, which I am wearing now.  </li>
      <li>I completely recommend purchasing this.</li>
      <li>I wanted to have a solid glitter effect for an event I was going to, but it was clear that the one-two coats given at a salon wouldn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
      <li>This takes several coats to get a solid glitter, but that is normal for glitter polish.</li>
      <li>Though it is a bit hard to get off it is completely worth it.</li>

<li> If you like full coverage polishes, I definitely recommend layering this over a solid color as the base is clear, however if you&#x27;re just looking for some bling</li>
<li> Spent an hour and still had flecks...</li>
<li> As with other glittery polishes, I strongly advise not applying directly to the nails, but having at least a base coat, preferably two, or another polish underneath</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a nail polish fanatic and this is definitely one of the happiest colors i&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
<li> The fuchsia base is my favorite, I think.  </li>
<li> I went through a half bottle of remover and had to scrub my toenails to get it off...</li>
<li> Yes Rainbow connection was a limited edition polish and it is now discontinued and hard to find but do not pay $30 for it.</li>
<li> OPI re-released a few of their discontinued glitters this spring, including Rainbow Connection under the name \\&quot;Chasing Rainbows.\\&quot;</li>
<li> You need a few coats to get the look you want</li>
<li> It has lots of flashes of color, glitz, and a silver base and is colorful like the Muppet gang.&lt;br /&gt;Cute</li>
<li> It is also hard to remove it and sometimes messes up your nails.</li>
<li> Polish goes on too thick.</li>
<li> (otherwise it&#x27;s very hard to take off).</li>
<li> For this color I definitely recommend a base color.</li>
<li> Even with an OPI base coat, the polish peeled off the next day.</li>
<li> The glitter nail polish is difficult to paint on nails without getting clumpy.  </li>
<li> I just had my nails done in this today over a black base coat!</li>
<li> WRONG!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My daughter loved this polish!  Her and her friends all sat around doing each others nails and having a great time...would buy again from seller received rather quickly!</li>
    <li> I had a mani/pedi done with this polish in a salon over Thanksgiving. I wanted to have a solid glitter effect for an event I was going to, but it was clear that the one-two coats given at a salon wouldn&#x27;t do the trick. Instead, I opted for a shimmery silver base coat and then topped it off with the OPI Rainbow Connection. What an awesome effect! I loved the way my nails looked, and it lasted a long time. By the time I chose to remove the polish, many of the larger pieces of glitter had flaked off. What I really liked about this product was that when the polish chipped, it wasn&#x27;t too obvious because of the many colors on my nails. Removing this polish is a huge pain, which is why I give only four stars. The glitter pieces are quite challenging to remove with nail polish remover. You&#x27;ll need to plan for extra time to scratch those beautiful sparkles off!</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sure the nail polish I received was authentic because it didn&#x27;t have an OPI serial number on it but the contents looked the same. Anyway, this polish is pleasantly deceiving because at first it looks like it should be a top coat, and I expected to have to apply 6 layers in order to achieve opacity. It actually went opaque in 2 coats! It&#x27;s because they didn&#x27;t skimp on the big glitter pieces so they cover a large area. Don&#x27;t expect the texture to be perfectly smooth - the hexagonal glitter will stick out in some areas and there&#x27;s no way to avoid this unless your nails are completely flat. I recieved so many compliments on this polish. The colors didn&#x27;t fade like they do on most other metallic glitter polishes, especially if you wash your hands a lot. It was a hassle to remove. I used the foil method and it didn&#x27;t make one bit of difference. I pretty much had to scrape the glitter off one piece at a time.</li>
    <li> Delievered in time the produckt I ordered, and I got a mini \\&quot;seche vite\\&quot; with it, which was very cute and a nice surprise :)</li>
    <li> I love glitter nail polish...call it a hangover from my childhood days, but I can&#x27;t stay away from the stuff.  This one is particularly awesome.

I find this looks best with one or two coats.  Another bonus?  This nail polish dries in a flash, so if you&#x27;re wanting to change your look from day to night, you can easily apply this polish over your day time one and add some sparkle to your look.</li>
    <li> Love OPI glitter polishes! Cute bright glitter but does need an undercoat or multiple coats to look good. If not, it will peel off in a sheet!</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish.  I bought 2 of the muppet collection already and cant&#x27; wait to get some of the others too.  It is just beautiful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nail polish fanatic and this is definitely one of the happiest colors i&#x27;ve ever found.  It is def the bling of a rainbow when you&#x27;re wearing it.  Love it!</li>
    <li> It takes 2 coats but I&#x27;ve never had this kind of sparkle on my nails. All of my friends at work keep asking where I got it. I can&#x27;t stop admiring how nice my nails look! I completely recommend purchasing this. FYI I couldnt find this in the stores anywhere.</li>
    <li> Got this color in the Muppets box set as well and it&#x27;s just fantastic! The color is shimmery and not overdone, and it looks just fantastic with any outfit. It doesn&#x27;t wear off very quickly and the color goes on really evenly with only 2-3 coats. Very feminine and a total must for this holiday season :)</li>
    <li> Polish goes on too thick. Can&#x27;t get the dots to distribute evenly. The concept it cool but you would have to put on 10 clumpy layers to have it look remotly like the picture. More trouble than its worth.</li>
    <li> I loved this nail polish! Its comprised of nothing but glitter! Though it is a bit hard to get off it is completely worth it.</li>
    <li> THIS POLISH IS REALLY PRETTY AND BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY HAS IT IT IS NOT OVERDONE. YOU CAN WEAR IT ALONE OR OVER COLOR. I ESPECIALLY LIKE IT FOR THE HOLIDAYS. I GOT LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS AND MY DAUGHTER AND HER FREIND EVEN BORROWED IT FROM ME.</li>
    <li> will be purchasing more of this polish; the color goes w/everything, compliments are in abundance and the coverage is just what is expected of opi although this particular polish needs about three coats to get the coverage in the picture.</li>
    <li> I loved the look of this in the bottle...But you need like 4 coats to cover the nail like in the picture...Even with an OPI base coat, the polish peeled off the next day. I thought it would like great on my toes...WRONG! I went through a half bottle of remover and had to scrub my toenails to get it off...Spent an hour and still had flecks...Ended up having to file it off. I am throwing it in the trash!</li>
    <li> This is great holiday or special occasion nail polish. I love OPI products and this is even radical for their line which is innovative and offers a huge amount of variety.&lt;br /&gt;Under normal circumstances I like polish that is easy to apply in one or two coats. This polish contains a lot of glitter which makes it cute but also time intensive to apply. It requires many coats, adequate drying time between coats, and tons of patience. Removing it is also a pain. It takes a lot of time, effort, and remover. My advice is go to the nail salon, bring Rainbow Connection, and chill when someone pampers you. Just remember to leave a nice tip.&lt;br /&gt;As for the color, if not called Rainbow Connection I&#x27;d call it Muppets In The Blender or Muppets ala Mode.  It has lots of flashes of color, glitz, and a silver base and is colorful like the Muppet gang.&lt;br /&gt;Cute stuff but definitely go to the salon.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish.  So sparkley fun!  It reminds me of childhood arts and crafts projects.  Glue and sprinkle!</li>
    <li> This is a great nail polish that looks great alone or over another color.  It dries quickly and I get tons of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Kinda pricey, but only because it&#x27;s a specialty (and discontinued) item. This takes several coats to get a solid glitter, but that is normal for glitter polish. You could use a solid color underneath to combat that. Glitter sizes and colors vary, but it looks very much like the photo.</li>
    <li> One star for the price. Yes Rainbow connection was a limited edition polish and it is now discontinued and hard to find but do not pay $30 for it. Don&#x27;t pay anything over $9 for it. OPI re-released a few of their discontinued glitters this spring, including Rainbow Connection under the name \\&quot;Chasing Rainbows.\\&quot; If you missed out on Rainbow connection, buy Chasing Rainbows for $9 retail. It is an exact duplicate.</li>
    <li> I love this polish. It looks great. You need a few coats to get the look you want but I love it.</li>
    <li> I just had my nails done in this today over a black base coat! Awesome! It&#x27;s so sparkly, perfect for New Years and the Holidays!</li>
    <li> Apply it alone or on any nail lacquer - it will look like you have jewels on your nails!  Gives a beautiful sparkling thing to your manicure and pedicure!</li>
    <li> The glitter nail polish is difficult to paint on nails without getting clumpy.  It is also hard to remove it and sometimes messes up your nails.</li>
    <li> After seeing the Muppets movie I couldn&#x27;t help myself - I just had to purchase Rainbow connection! I absolutely love the different shades of glitter. It looks good layered over black. For this color I definitely recommend a base color. The glitter is suspended in clear polish and it will take many coats (too many for me) to get a continuous glitter coat like what you see in the bottle.</li>
    <li> OPI Muppets collection nail lacquer is a must! I had it  shipped from the U S and it arrived in record time.</li>
    <li> It is very pretty and use it all the time. It is great for a gift and even for yourself.</li>
    <li> The Rainbow Connection is truly a versatile polish! As with other glittery polishes, I strongly advise not applying directly to the nails, but having at least a base coat, preferably two, or another polish underneath (otherwise it&#x27;s very hard to take off). Plus you want a top coat to set the glittery bits. Shake it up really well to get a good distribution of glitter. Very rainbow-y on just clear polish underneath, but also gorgeous over any solid nail color, because it is so very sparkly. To get the pictured effect, you do need to apply more than one coat. This item in the Muppets collection is colorful and so much fun!</li>
    <li> Need to use a lot of coats for it to show, and is a pain to remove! The only good thing about it is it dries quickly!</li>
    <li> Great color with the quality you expect from OPI. I was in search for a fun glitter polish. It&#x27;s lovely, but does chip easily.</li>
