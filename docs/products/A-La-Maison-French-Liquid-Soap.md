      <li>Really nice smell and has a good lather to it.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t over-dry and this particular fragrance is great -- very pleasant and energizing non-artificial smell.</li>
      <li>My favorite hand soap ever...!</li>
      <li>It cleans nicely without leaving residue.</li>
      <li>My main reason for choosing this brand is the perfect consistency of the liquid.</li>
      <li>I love the way this soap smells.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This product was fabulous!</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I thought it was a bit pricey for hand soap and would like it more if the price were more affordable.  </li>
      <li>I really love the rosemary mint combo though, which is why i chose to go with this.  </li>
      <li>I take some responsibility for this rating as I was expecting it to smell more like CO Bigelow&#x27;s Rosemary Mint soap.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this soap.</li>
      <li>Just love it.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and use it both as a hand soap and as a shower gel.</li>
      <li>It has considerably more fragrance than their bar soap.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even used it on my face to excellent effect--it washes off all traces of makeup but leaves my skin feeling smooth, not tight and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It foams well and smells amazing, and it&#x27;s very gentle but effective.</li>
      <li>I bought it mainly for the scent; I didn&#x27;t expect the soap to be so nice, though!</li>
      <li>This soap makes your hands feel so fresh and so clean!!</li>
      <li>The ingredients are clean and it doesn&#x27;t have any SLS, Parabens or Phthalates.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m quite certain I will be purchasing more of this soap, and I&#x27;ll be doing that at Whole Foods since they have it for a more competitive price.</li>
      <li>It also has an amazing, natural smell.</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite soap and &amp;#34;flavor.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It works so well with a nice lather, and it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.  </li>
      <li>A La Maison&#x27;s is very soft on the mint, strong on the rosemary so while it has a fresh clean smell</li>
      <li>It also doesnt dry out your hands which is a huge plus!!</li>
      <li>I first became aware of this soap when I received it as a gift.</li>
      <li>it is similar to more aggressive cleaners.  </li>
      <li>I bought Cucina Purifying Hand Wash (Ginger and Sicilian Lemon) at the same time and do like that Hand Wash better.</li>
      <li>I usually make my own with essential oils, but it&#x27;s nice to have a go to store</li>
      <li>And the pump container works pretty well, though it occasionally partially plugs up leading to the soap spurting out in humorous directions.  </li>
      <li>Non-drying, gentle, with a creamy lather.</li>
      <li>Wife and I both really like their liquid soap.</li>
      <li>The hand soap is so gentle, I&#x27;ve brought it into the shower and used it as a shower gel.</li>
      <li>Most of the natural options I have tried have been disappointing in terms of scent or lather, but this soap is great on all accounts.  </li>
      <li>a fabulous lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to emphasize how much I appreciate that this company has kept their ingredient list short and the quality high.</li>
      <li>This soap has basic ingredients, a unique and pleasing scent, and</li>
      <li>This particular scent is solidly unisex, which is cool too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The ingredients are so simple and work for pretty much anything.</li>
      <li>Overall I like it very much, would love it if the price were a few dollars cheaper.</li>
      <li>You need less of it to get your hands clean.</li>
      <li>purchased this soap (and the Honeysuckle scented version) from my local Whole Foods.</li>
      <li>Only problem was the bottle came damaged, at least the hole was on the top &amp; it doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
      <li>I was tempted by the price point but will likely invest in the CO Bigelow next time as it is what I really wanted.</li>
      <li>But the fragrance is still subtle and pleasant, the bar soap ha very little detectable scent.</li>
      <li>It is much thicker than other brands I&#x27;ve had.</li>

<li> Washing the pump tip usually clears this up.</li>
<li> Some are too thin and some too thick, so that half of it drops into the sink as I start to rub my hands together.</li>
<li> The bottle I got was somewhat annoying because the pump did not work, you just pump and no soap comes out, so when my old bottle of another scent ran out I just swapped the pumps.</li>
<li> I guess I just expect the bottle to work on an expensive bottle of hand soap.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My favorite hand soap ever...! The scent is not strong but enough to feel. I have very dry hands but this soap moisturize your hands unlike other brands make your hands dry.</li>
    <li> I wanted to find a hand soap that was non-toxic and actually worked.  This is the best soap for hand washing!  It works so well with a nice lather, and it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.  It smells so good but without any synthetic perfume. The ingredients are clean and it doesn&#x27;t have any SLS, Parabens or Phthalates.  I usually make my own with essential oils, but it&#x27;s nice to have a go to store bought.  I keep it at my kitchen sink.</li>
    <li> I love the way this soap smells.&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for soaps without SLS, parabens and other artificial ingredients and this appears to be well made with simple ingredients.  Most of the natural options I have tried have been disappointing in terms of scent or lather, but this soap is great on all accounts.  Works great as a body wash too.</li>
    <li> A wonderful liquid hand soap. Added benefit is that it perfumes the bathroom during use!</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite soap and &amp;#34;flavor.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap because I wash my hands a lot and I&#x27;m tired of them getting dried out by harsh chemicals that are nearly ubiquitous in hand cleaners. This soap has basic ingredients, a unique and pleasing scent, and a fabulous lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to emphasize how much I appreciate that this company has kept their ingredient list short and the quality high.

    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this soap on Amazon, but I do plan to repurchase it on here once mine runs out. I absolutely love this soap. It foams well and smells amazing, and it&#x27;s very gentle but effective. I&#x27;ve used it for everything. Shower gel, shampoo, face wash, hand soap, you name it. The ingredients are so simple and work for pretty much anything. Great value.</li>
    <li> Smells like an expensive French cologne. Wonderful sophisticated fragrance.  This product is a winner.  I will order it again and keep it as a staple.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for myself and one for my sister because she raved every time she washed her hands.  The bottle is a generous 16.9 oz so it lasts forever.  Just love it.</li>
    <li> I take some responsibility for this rating as I was expecting it to smell more like CO Bigelow&#x27;s Rosemary Mint soap.  A La Maison&#x27;s is very soft on the mint, strong on the rosemary so while it has a fresh clean smell it is similar to more aggressive cleaners.

Some are too thin and some too thick, so that half of it drops into the sink as I start to rub my hands together. It cleans nicely without leaving residue. I never cared for liquid soap before trying this brand. I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with liquid soaps, but this one seems perfect to me.

After using it a few times I was hocked.  I found it on the internet and ordered another bottle. It lasts a very long time. I love it.</li>
    <li> Very nice scent &amp; soap cleans well. Only problem was the bottle came damaged, at least the hole was on the top &amp; it doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
    <li> Great soap! I love this stuff and use it both as a hand soap and as a shower gel. It doesn&#x27;t over-dry and this particular fragrance is great -- very pleasant and energizing non-artificial smell. This particular scent is solidly unisex, which is cool too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was rating the soap itself I&#x27;d give it a 5/5. However more times than not the pump dispensers are non-functional, which is a little inconvenient. I&#x27;d recommend buying the cap-top version if you can find it.</li>
    <li> I came across this soap at a TJ Maxx and picked it up just before Christmas. I bought it mainly for the scent; I didn&#x27;t expect the soap to be so nice, though! Non-drying, gentle, with a creamy lather. The hand soap is so gentle, I&#x27;ve brought it into the shower and used it as a shower gel. I&#x27;ve even used it on my face to excellent effect--it washes off all traces of makeup but leaves my skin feeling smooth, not tight and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish I could get this in a lotion.</li>
    <li> This soap makes your hands feel so fresh and so clean!! It also has an amazing, natural smell. It also doesnt dry out your hands which is a huge plus!!</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot, good for folks trying to avoid sulfates or skin irritants. The bottle I got was somewhat annoying because the pump did not work, you just pump and no soap comes out, so when my old bottle of another scent ran out I just swapped the pumps. I guess I just expect the bottle to work on an expensive bottle of hand soap.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance and excellent dispenser. Wife and I both really like their liquid soap. It has considerably more fragrance than their bar soap. But the fragrance is still subtle and pleasant, the bar soap ha very little detectable scent.</li>
    <li> This product was fabulous! The smell and the way it makes my hands feel afterward is amazing...will buy this product again and again!</li>
