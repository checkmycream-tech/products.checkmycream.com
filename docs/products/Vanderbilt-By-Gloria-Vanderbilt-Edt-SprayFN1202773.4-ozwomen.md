    <li> Sadly, the formula has changed and the perfume does not remotely smell like the original.  Very disappointed but, since I cannot return it, I will give it a chance.  Sigh...  EDIT:  I&#x27;ve been gradually getting used to this scent.  Although it&#x27;s not what I remember, I&#x27;ve grown to like it in this short time.  It lasts a long time and, if you don&#x27;t bathe yourself with it, it&#x27;s a pleasant scent.  A little goes a long way !!  I&#x27;m now giving it 3 stars instead of 1 !!!</li>
    <li> I have always loved the smell of this perfume! I try and keep one handy at all times. I do use other kinds too, but sometimes I just want this one. Love it!</li>
    <li> Made my wife happy.  Happy wife, Happy life</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price....</li>
