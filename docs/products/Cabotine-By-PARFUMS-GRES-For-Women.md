      <li>no where near Christian Dior&#x27;s Poison, but if you accept this perfume on it&#x27;s own merit it is fine as an everyday wear.</li>
      <li>It smells better than some more expensive fragrances.</li>
      <li>and wow there it was  thanks</li>
      <li>I get the product but did not know quw wra just a cheap imitation</li>

<li> This little gem will stand toe to toe with some of the more expensive designer brands around.</li>
<li> cannot buy and send by courier directly to me, because Uruguayan Custom is horrible, and most of the times you never get what was sent.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
<li> Soft, subtle, feminine!</li>
<li> There waas a small dent in the box that held the fragrance bottle, but did not affect the product</li>
<li> Extremely BAD QUALITY!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It is a favorite fragrance of my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, any perfume or fragrance just makes my sinuses congested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good value for this sized bottle nonetheless.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an annual Xmas gift for my mom. She loves the scent and bought it about 14 years ago in Paris and has been wearing it ever since. So glad to find it here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this scent since I was 15! It is a strong smell that lasts all day!  Im so thrilled to have found it on here!</li>
    <li> I love Cabotine! I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years and I always get compliments from many people. It smells better than some more expensive fragrances.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance. Think of White Linen with a hint of fruity notes. The scent may/will vary on various skin types.</li>
    <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;The best perfume in 1990, and still is perfect to use all day long.&lt;br /&gt;Lovely bottle,nice color and refreshing scent.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell all that much for my taste so I gave it as a birthday present and the person does seem to like it. It&#x27;s not a fragrance that everyone will wear, it&#x27;s kind of spicy. I will give it a few stars though because it doesn&#x27;t smell cheap.</li>
    <li> Used this perfume for years and was excited to find it on Amazon for a good price. It&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
    <li> Extremely BAD QUALITY!!! I was deceived cause I know the original Cabotine. And this one is cheaper and is like water+alcool.  If you&#x27;re expecting the original, DON&#x27;T BUY IT!</li>
    <li> I received a lot of smiles and compliments up presentation of this item to the woman that I have lived with for over 56&lt;br /&gt;years</li>
    <li> Good afternoon ... I get the product but did not know quw wra just a cheap imitation, you would have quw be fine in the product description. Shame</li>
    <li> One of the things I noticed in my trips to Europe is the rarity of cheap fragrance. (and the blessed lack of exposed underwear with pants!) I bought this for my daughters semester abroad and it is obviously a better class of parfum . The smell is very feminine and clean and has a lovely lingering quality .</li>
    <li> Best purchase. ...I love it</li>
    <li> By far one of the best perfumes for the price. This little gem will stand toe to toe with some of the more expensive designer brands around. It&#x27;s one of my favorite scents for Spring and summer. I get more compliments from this perfume than from any other more expensive brand I own. Moderate silage and longevity. Just don&#x27;t overspray!</li>
    <li> I love Cabotine. i fill comfortable when i use the perfume. I stared used more that 10 years ago and i never changed.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite!</li>
    <li> My contact person who lives in Washigton DC only comes to Uruguay 2/3 times a year, otherwise I could buy more often.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot buy and send by courier directly to me, because Uruguayan Custom is horrible, and most of the times you never get what was sent.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very  much for asking, I think Amazon is simply great!!I wish you were here in Uruguay!&lt;br /&gt;With kind regards&lt;br /&gt;Dalma D&amp;iacute;az</li>
