<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it is the best lotion applicator for my back that I have ever had. The handle could be a little wider for more stability, other than that it is fairly easy to use.</li>
    <li> Works great, very sturdy</li>
    <li> LOVE this!  It has held up very well over time - just rinse it well every time you use it.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get mine to bend quite as much as in the picture and hold, I keep saying &amp;#34;practice makes perfect&amp;#34;, so I&#x27;m still practicing!&lt;br /&gt;The whole backward thing takes a little practice anyway, but I use it and I can make it fit my needs.</li>
    <li> Nice bendable handle that allows you to adjust the wand for wherever you need to reach.  Great for people that have limited mobility.</li>
    <li> Flex body reach seems to do the job,i am pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Reach Mate for years. Several years ago when I needed something to apply lotions to my back, I went online and researched all the different applicators that were available. None of them looked very good and most of the reviews talked about applicator sponges falling off after a few usages. The sponges were all small and the handles were infexible. They really looked more disposable. I didn&#x27;t like the looks of the ball lotion applicators, especially since I was beginning to apply oils as well.    This looked great, I bought it, and I&#x27;ve never looked back except once. The products became temporarily unavailable, (death in the family) and I had to go elsewhere for pads. I got something from England that was barely adequate (short handle, hard pads, glue issues) and then one day I got an email saying these products would be available again. I was overjoyed and immediately went to the site to purchase my pads which arrived VERY quickly.    There is absolutely nothing else like this out there. It travels easily (you can bend it to fit in your suitcase or get a shorter one) and if you do use oils, keep the head clean and the velcro will last a very long time. My only wish is that they also sold the velcro rounds as I do eventually manage to get oil under it. However, I have been using the same one for many months with no problem.     K T</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful tool -- ordered after I slipped on ice and fractured my wrist. Got the 18-inch version to ensure maximum reach. Only minor complaint is the plastic handle takes more strength than I have to bend, but it defaults to a slight curve which works just fine. Lotion spreads out on the pads, which I wash after every few uses. Recommended for anyone with limited arm movement/reach who needs to apply lotion or medication.</li>
    <li> Body reach works great. I can wash my back with medicated soap. before I could not find anything to do that.</li>
    <li> Works really well for reaching spots in the middle of the back especially with the bendable handle.  Bought several for friends.  All loved it.</li>
    <li> I think I probably bought the first model wand that was on the market in the late 90&#x27;s!  I have never stopped buying newer ones and using them  There are no other applicators, in my opinion,  on the market that can top these wands.  I use the 18&amp;#34; wand mostly, but have the 22&amp;#34; and the smaller one also.  I use them for everything from sun lotion to foamy medication.  Since I have some physical problems, I love being able to put a mirror or a brush on the wand.  Once in awhile I forget to wet down the sponge before I use it, but it still works.  You do want to keep them clean.  I have different sponges for different lotions.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this (I already have though, haven&#x27;t I?)  If they were no longer available, I don&#x27;t know what I would do!  They are easy to use for me, and work SO well!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for someone who can&#x27;t easily move arms after shoulder surgery. She said that it is great to use and easy enough to adjust. So I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Good for applying lotion to the back.</li>
    <li> Use it everyday to reach those places on your back that your arms can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Although I have not had to use this product yet, it does seem to be what I have been needing. I am sure it will do all I need it too. I have osteoarthritis and it is very hard to apply pain ointments on my upper back  and shoulders, so I am glad I have found this product.It is very sturdy and I do believe it will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised and is of help!</li>
    <li> I order this for my brother for his back , he loves it , but it&#x27;s hard to bend it</li>
    <li> I got this for my partner. It reaches everywhere it  needs to reach on his back, including the spots he wasn&#x27;t able to reach before. And the pad rinses out  nicely. Good product.</li>
    <li> It is listed as semi-flex but it does not flex at all.  Maybe I ordered the wrong one. I do like the pad size and that it is easily removable.</li>
    <li> I have short arms and live alone - need I say more - it is a dream come true - thanks Semi-Flex</li>
    <li> Excellent for back area to apply lotion. Be sure to buy an extra pad of pads to have on hand: Sponge-Ables 8-Pack for Body-Reach</li>
    <li> My dermatologist told me about your flex and reach brush and it does the job beautifully allowing me to get to my mid back. Splendid! I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Finally a lotion applicator for my back that applies lotion to heal my itching back!  Wahoo!  The Sponge-Ables removable applicators are washable so using one sponge per application is healthier than re-using the same applicator.</li>
    <li> I am not able to apply a pain reliever cream to my back properly by myself.  This is very useful because it&#x27;s long enough and flexible enough to reach different areas.  It takes a minute to bend it, and then goes back to straight, so you would have to bend it every time you use it.  The sponges spread the cream evenly, better than my fingers.  You can reconfigure the sponge so that it gets between toes.  I was delighted to learn that there are other attachments available, including mirror, loofah.  I&#x27;ve only just received it so I can&#x27;t comment on long-term use.</li>
    <li> almost perfect.  just a little hard to work the cream into the skin</li>
    <li> It was fine while it lasted but that wasn&#x27;t nearly as long as advertised - removing to wash the pads loosened the outer layer.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item to more-easily apply lotion to my back.  It does the job but is difficult to bend to the shape I wanted.  And it takes some practice to get the lotion to the areas I want.  Product gets the job done but is not necessarily easy to use.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as god as I thought it would</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this is made in the USA but I agree that it is difficult to bend and generally awkward to use compared to the fixed bamboo model I had.  The pads have a tendency to curl under themselves - I use it but wish it were better designed.</li>
    <li> First product I was able to find for my son to be able to apply his prescription back wash.  He is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I had and older model handle that came apart when I used a water disposable oil and didn&#x27;t rinse it well enough. The glue came off and I couldn&#x27;t use it. This handle is much longer and sturdier than the old handle. I will be more careful with how I use it.</li>
    <li> The applicator really works great. I can now get to every spot on my back with medication. I get itchy areas from my chemo. It works great.</li>
    <li> This item does what it claims, however I can think of a few improvements for those of us who are a little arthritic in the hands.  The wand takes some strength to bend, but it does bend.  Overnight it will return to its original shape.  It would be nice if it stayed bent until you want to change it.  The other feature I would improve on it is the handle.  If it were a bit wider and thicker it would be easier to grasp and hold onto.  My last improvement would be to have a pad with a more slippery surface on one side and the sticky surface for adhering to the wand on the other side.  I think a more polished surface would make it easier to rub the back and less lotion would get absorbed into the pad. Despite all those wishes of mine, this is the best product on the market for its intended purpose.</li>
    <li> EASY TO USE TO APPLY SUNSCRREN.  NO LONGER FEEL I MISSED SPOTS TRYING TO SPRAY OR APPLY SUNSCREEN BY MYSELF!</li>
    <li> Very helpful in applying body lotion, especially in the winter when your back is dry.  And the sponges are easy to wash.</li>
    <li> This product is just like they say. I can bend it and apply lotion to my back. Will also come in handy for applying sun screen</li>
    <li> i would recommend this to my family and friends, especially aging people with arthritis.  It enables one to apply cream, suntan lotion, medicated cream which is what I needed it for.  I had developed a small area of dry skin right at my shoulder blade that itched beyond belief.  This means a person doesn&#x27;t need another to rub it on for them.</li>
    <li> Even though it says that the product is semi flexible, in actual sense, it is not at all even quarter flexible let alone semi.&lt;br /&gt;I am seriously thinking of stopping to buy things from Amazon now.&lt;br /&gt;I had two bad experiences in a week.</li>
    <li> This product helped tremendously. For years I had problems treating my back w medicated lotions because it was too hard for me to reach and I am always living alone. Now I have found the solution and it works to reach mid back where I can&#x27;t get to. I took one star off because I haven&#x27;t tried bending it for those who want to bend it a certain way Personally I never needed to bend. Also I tried to wash the pad and it doesn&#x27;t last long so I will need to purchase more pads instead of buying a new one, that&#x27;ll save me money.</li>
    <li> This came in very handy when I broke the wrist of my dominant hand.  This helped me reach spots that I otherwise would not have been able to get to.</li>
    <li> I was not impress with the product, too short with not brush a back scrubber should come with a brush.</li>
    <li> Brush not bendable. No lotion applicators included. Useless purchase.</li>
    <li> Works just as described.  Pads hold lotion very well, and are easy to clean. Applicator is very sturdy.  Great product!</li>
    <li> It is flexible...but you have to remember to wash the pad every few uses.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try just running it under warm water.</li>
    <li> The bendable applicator design is poor.  There is no way the handle can be prevented from rotating when the hand is soapy.  The surface of the handle is very smooth but should be knurled or have grit imbedded into its surface.  I tried to use it twice - not since. It is worthless.</li>
    <li> Well, I am disappointed.  I have arthritis in my hands and this is VERY hard to bend.. It is hard to get the pad to remain flat against your back.  It keeps rotating so that the side of the pad is against my back.  Too hard to use.</li>
    <li> Worst product of its kind. Beware of the misleading presentation: it may be unbreakable - but it&#x27;s also unbendable!  The handle, which is supposed to be flexible, is in fact so rigid, and requires such force to bend that it is almost impossible for the average person.  Even the instructions suggest it must be pushed against a hard surface to manoeuvre... (a fact that is not mentioned on the product page!).&lt;br /&gt;With the bendable feature being not achievable, the product is ultimately useless (There are better and cheaper alternatives out there).  STAY AWAY.</li>
    <li> With limited flexibility, this is just what my 87 year old mother needed.  The pads are easy to remove and can be washed and used again and again.</li>
    <li> This applicator is very useful. I recommend that the user bend the flexible handle to reach the mid and lower back.</li>
    <li> BENDABLE, LITTLE BEND, FULL BEND. VELCRO SEPARATES FROM PAD TOO QUICK WHEN USING SUN TAN OIL. I HAVE YET TO TRY IT WLITH LOTION. HOPEFULLY PAD WILL LAST LONGER WITH LOTION. HEARTILY RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t bend like the picture shows, and soaks up some moisturizer, but it sure is handy. That&#x27;s why I only gave it 4/5.</li>
    <li> It worked out very well.  I was pleased with my pruchase and ordered another&lt;br /&gt;one for a friends birthday later.</li>
    <li> I husband travels and when he is not home and I need to put china gel on my sore neck or shoulders this works perfectly.  I even use it to put oil on my dry back at times.  It is an amazing inventions!</li>
    <li> She says it&#x27;s great.  Reaches all places she can&#x27;t. Great for senoirs</li>
    <li> Great  gadget for someone who lives alone.I can finally apply lotions and creams to my  back without asking someone else to do it for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my elderly mother who has arthritis, breast cancer, elbow surgery, etc. to apply pain medicine to her shoulder.  She seems to like it and is using it when no one is around to help with application.  The neck is flexible but not flimsy.  It comes with 2 pads to alternate when one is being cleaned.</li>
    <li> The wand is sturdy and makes it possible to reach every part of your back. It doesn&#x27;t bend all that much, but I didn&#x27;t really need it to. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> very hard to use when the handle or your hand is wet.</li>
    <li> This is the second lotion applicator I&#x27;ve used, and I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I did hope.  It spreads lotion evenly, hits all the spots on your back and cleaning up is so easy!  I&#x27;m so glad I bought this and I hope it lasts for many years.  I bought extra sponges in the hope that it would, and I can&#x27;t see why it wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I expected - the handle does not stay bent, but I like it and use it often.  Customer service from the ReachMate Plus was outstanding.  Great company to work with.</li>
    <li> Just as it says it is! Does what I want it to do! I can easily put lotion on my back...I just smooth it on the pad &amp; bend the handle &amp; it works! JUST LIKE THAT! The pads can actually remain on the wand, you can rinse them on the wand &amp; it  makes the pads last longer. If you remove them every time, the pads wear out faster.</li>
    <li> Best I have used to date.  When no one is around to help with getting lotion on your shoulders or pain stuff on your back, this will do it.  Wish the bend would stay in longer, but it is very sturdy, and does the job.  Very pleased with it.  Have tried others and wound up junking them.</li>
    <li> DOESN&#x27;T WORK AS SHOWN. DISAPPOINTED THAT IT DOES NOT STAY BENT, HOWEVER, CAN BE USED AS A BACKSCRACHER. WORKS WELL FOR THAT.</li>
    <li> Everything I have ordered from Amazon has been excellent and just what I wanted!!</li>
    <li> It really works... solved my problem...</li>
    <li> She is alone in Europe and needs to apply cream on her back. She tells me they work perfectly. I also bought the replacement pads. What really impressed me is that this company shipped the item to Europe !</li>
    <li> Whether you live alone or with someone, there is nothing like this to put lotion on your own back and other hard to reach places.  It can be bent and the sponges are washable and reusable.  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Hard to handle.  Also very hard to bend.  Have used it maybe 3 times. Too much trouble when lotion gobs up.  would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Applicator works as described - bends to reach hard to reach places - extra pads for applicator are a great addition to product.</li>
    <li> One day I was wondering how I&#x27;d be able to put lotion on my dry skin in hard to reach places.  I found this wand and it works so well!! I might have to order one for my husband!</li>
    <li> This is great I have given as presents and use myself the pads wash easily for several uses this is my second after using the last one for years</li>
    <li> This has really helped me get lotion on my winter-dry back.  My only beef is that it is kind of hard to bend.  I have decent flexibility in my shoulder, so I can still use it easily without bending.</li>
    <li> This came on time and very quickly. It works like a charm for hard-to-reach places. Clean-up is very quick as well.</li>
    <li> I got this for putting medication on a mole I had removed which became infected.  As I live alone I had no one to put the medicine on twice a day.  This is rigid and you cannot bend it or straighten so sometimes it did not work for me.  It says it is bendable but only a little bit.  The pads are nice and thick and wash out ok with detergent.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product, innovative and extremely useful. I have very limited range of motion and neuropathy in my feet, so this makes it possible for me to apply skin lotion and analgesic lotion easily even to the bottom of my feet. This is one of those products that does exactly what it says it will do, and it appears to be very sturdy and well made. The velcro and re-usable pads are pure genius. Love it, thank you!</li>
    <li> My mom needed someway to put her pain reliever on her back and this was the answer. Bendable applicator is much better than a straight stick. Easy to clean applicators that can be reused.</li>
    <li> This flexible wand make applying medication easier than a wand with a straight handle.  I only wish it would bend a little more.  It&#x27;s rather stiff and straightens out a little as it is used.</li>
    <li> Item does not bend like the picture.  We put it on a vice and it bends right back to straight.  Item a fraud</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this lotion wand and wish I had gotten it a long time ago.  I have severe arthritis and a bad hip so have some mobility issues.  This wand is just the tool I needed to help me put lotion on my feet and legs.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Works great for moisturizing my back.</li>
    <li> There may be cheaper versions, but this is a well designed and constructed product well worth the cost. The pad holds and spreads lotion well with a short nap that is easy to wash and dry. I bought extra pads, but could get by for years with the ones included.&lt;br /&gt;The 18&amp;#34; length is fine for me (I have no mobility problems), but the longer version might be a very good choice for someone who can&#x27;t rotate the shoulder joint to a high position but needs to reach the pad lower down the back than the upper shoulder blades.&lt;br /&gt;The bendable shaft works well and is a very useful feature but takes at least normal hand strength to bend. Even with very impaired hand strength you could still bend it by flexing it over one&#x27;s knee or the padded arm of a chair. Running hot tap water over it also makes bending easier. An extreme bend (as in the product photo) will not stay permanently; the shaft gradually becomes more straight overnight and may need to be flexed again before each use.</li>
    <li> I like it because I can reach my back in area&#x27;s I could not reach before.  Great ideal and concept.</li>
    <li> picture shows t bent.  It comes straight and is next to impossible to get in the pictured position.  I bought this for my Mom who has very arthritic hands, there is no way she can position this by herself.</li>
    <li> When the hubby is not home I am on my own when it comes to applying sunscreen to my back. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s pretty good, and so far the applicator sponge has really held up, I&#x27;ve used it for a few months now. Really, it&#x27;s a very clever idea.</li>
    <li> Although like previous previewers have said, it does not bend easily or for me at all but I really like the&lt;br /&gt;removable pads and have already washed one and it came out great</li>
    <li> Great quality, easy to use. Exceeds what I expected. Curve of wand and wide pad puts lotion where (generally or specifically) you want it.</li>
