    <li> I have worn this for years it last all day for older woman like my self love the smell</li>
    <li> No idea. Bought it for a lady as a gift and have not given it to her as yet.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this perfume for as long as I can remember. Always nice to find it at a better price.</li>
    <li> I enjoy wearing this fragrance and receive many compliments when wearing it.  I would also suggest the bath powder.  It is a worthwhile luxury to enjoy this fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is not the same product you would receive in a department store. I bought a bottle for my wife, and wound up going to a local department store to get her &amp;#34;the real deal&amp;#34; as the fragrance ordered here does not last.</li>
    <li> the purchase was very fast, i didnt expect that. the product has a very strong odor, and its perfect for the night</li>
    <li> Alway love the parfum, can&#x27;t wait to order my second bottel</li>

    <li> I love this perfume!It came as it should packaged and new and the fragrance is so fantastic that people frequently stop me to ask what it is!</li>
    <li> NEVER will I go thru Sams club again..not for perfume anyway. Within my entire order of over$250 this was the only item that charged me shipping and it took 10 days to get to me...also the price was too high...could&#x27;ve gotten A LOT cheaper and faster at home.  Hands down on Sam&#x27;S Club for me!</li>
    <li> very refreshing sent, bought for wife as a gift, she loves it as well as i do. i would buy it again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Estee Lauder Youth Dew since the 1970s, when it was a favorite with my mother.  It smells beautiful for women of any age, and the unique bottle looks great on your dresser.  Rich, clean, sweet scent.  Be sure to try the powder, too.</li>
    <li> my mother first gave me this fragrance years ago.. I had just gotten burned out on another well know scent and this one has survived.. it is not heavey</li>
    <li> My wife has used this fragrance for many years and loves it.&lt;br /&gt;People ask her frequently which fragrance she is wearing.</li>
    <li> En realidad el producto no llegado a mis manos, no me percate que los perfumes son un problemas para despacharlos a otros paises. Necesito una soluci&amp;oacute;n pronto</li>
    <li> Youth Dew is a cologne that I have worn for years.  Of the 4 that I want, this is one that I am so pleased to have been able to purchase.</li>
    <li> It seems as if this perfume is really Youth Dew, but it smells like perfume that has set a long time.  It&#x27;s either old, not truly Estee Lauder or perhaps the formula has changed. I would not recommend this product.</li>
