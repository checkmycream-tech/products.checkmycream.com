<li> You have 2 press pretty hard to get it 2</li>
<li> Not soft twist up pencils, not vibrant colors, not as pictured or described..</li>
<li> You can go to the Dollar Store and buy pencils all day long 4 a lot less money.</li>
<li> When I contacted the seller they were not even aware of how awful there product was, I did not buy mine from Amazon, but it&#x27;s the exact same product.</li>
<li> I do wish they were a little brighter like the pictures advertise</li>
<li> BBUT super disappointed once the tip of the color is gone</li>
<li> Hard plastic pencil, not a twist up nor can you sharpen, so once u use the little bit that is there ur done.  </li>
<li> Not a good product,you are basically just paying for the tips, the don&#x27;t extend so they are a Hugh waste of money.</li>
<li> and I had to keep reapplying to keep the same color throughout the day, but to me it&#x27;s not as bad as others put it.</li>
<li> Not happy with this purchase.</li>
<li> Your picture is showing false advertising.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed that these are not self sharpening as they seem to appear in the photo.</li>

    <li> Nothing like pictured.  Colors are not near that bright.  You have 2 press pretty hard to get it 2 go on 2 try and get the colors in the pic.  Hard plastic pencil, not a twist up nor can you sharpen, so once u use the little bit that is there ur done.  You can go to the Dollar Store and buy pencils all day long 4 a lot less money.</li>
    <li> They were all melted upon arrival</li>

    <li> I got this for christmas from a friend the black is awesome the other colors are kind of not bright. Your picture is showing false advertising.  And there is no way to twist the bottom of it to get the product out so how do you get the product to move up the tube? Oh and you cant Sharpen it with a pencil sharpener. Just fyi</li>
    <li> The colors were less bright than advertised. They work great, but i would reccomend expecting more earthy colors and less &amp;#34;ultra vibrant&amp;#34; colors</li>
    <li> Not soft twist up pencils, not vibrant colors, not as pictured or described.. Ok for stick pencils but nothing you can&#x27;t get at the drug store for a whole lot less..</li>
