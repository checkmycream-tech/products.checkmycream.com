<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I received this product for free,for review purposes,all thoughts and or opinions are my own and I was not compensated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just tried this mud mask for the first time,and I thought it did a pretty good job of making my skin feel clean.I noticed that it did make my skin feel tight afterwards,but only a little and it did not irritate my skin or make me break out.This mud mask may look yucky like mud but it works and does not smell bad like I thought it would,it can be a little messy so I suggests using it in the shower,i did this and it eliminated the possibility of it getting all over my bathroom or clothes.I think it might be suited for someone who has oily skin,it  dried mines out a little,but skin products tend to do this for me anyways.I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good cleaning facial mask or cleanser.Also I want to mention that I have had the pleasure of doing a few reviews for this company and some of there other products,which i love as well,so keep an eye out for future reviews for the other items.They are a great company,enjoy your masks.</li>
    <li> Only takes a small amount to cover face. After using, my skin felt very soft and was visibly smooth.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted feels good</li>
    <li> This is the second product of LAVO I use now. It is fantastic! It feels cool and silky when you apply it. I like its smell too. The wonderful thing is after 10 minutes application, my face become glowing, soft, silky. My pores are minimized too. I love it!</li>
    <li> smoother skin and less noticeable pores.  However, it took some scrubbing with a washcloth to get all the mask out of my pores.</li>
    <li> Good mask. It does not tighten like other masks I have tried. Pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had the opportunity to use a mud mask before. I was really excited to try this since I have oily skin. It has a nice refreshing smell. It’s like a peppermint and rosemary scent. First I cleansed my face. Then, I applied a thin layer to my face and let it set for 10 minutes. I didn&#x27;t want to leave it on too long since that was my first try. The mask had a cooling sensation on my skin. The mask started to dry and I began to feel my skin tighten. After 10 minutes, I rinsed my face with warm water and patted dry. I instantly noticed a glow on my face. I could tell that the mask pulled the dirty oils out of my skin. My pores appeared to be smaller and my face looked smoother. My skin felt renewed and refreshed. I absolutely love the Honey Almond Scrub that came with this. It smells wonderful.  I received this product in exchange for sharing my honest opinion. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally</li>
    <li> The LAVO Ultra Detoxifying Mud Mask has a dark gray with a hint of greenish color and has a peppermint-y scent. It&#x27;s very thick and paste-like and has a cool feel on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have a skin type leaning to the oilier side, I was quite excited to try this mud mask from LAVO. I read the directions and followed it. I cleansed my face first before putting the mud mask on and with a slight damp face, I proceeded to apply the LAVO Ultra Detoxifying Mud Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve said, the LAVO Ultra Detoxifying Mud Mask has a cool initial feel on my skin. It has a peppermint-y scent so make sure you don&#x27;t put some close to your eye. I accidentally put a little bit of the mud mask near my eyes and I teared up a little because of the peppermint-y scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used a mud mask, my daughters were scared of me. LOL. Now, they got used to me looking like a mud monster so they just laugh whenever they see me with a mud mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the mud mask dries up, I feel a tingling and tightening sensation but it&#x27;s not painful or irritating at all. I actually like the feeling because I feel like the mud mask is working to help tighten my skin a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 15 minutes I rinsed my face with warm water. I patted it dry and I love how brighter and radiant my skin looks like. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how the LAVO Ultra Detoxifying Mud Mask works. I like how it gives me the tightening/tingling sensation on my skin as it dries up. I have 2 big pimples on my chin before I used the LAVO Ultra Detoxifying Mud Mask and after rinsing it off, I noticed my pimples have remarkably gotten smaller and less inflamed. My pores appeared smaller and my skin looked fresh and hydrated. I like that I didn&#x27;t get any breakouts or any other allergic reactions while I used the LAVO Ultra Detoxifying Mud Mask. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free sample to inspect, try and review however, all opinions are unbiased, honest and my own. No other form of compensation was received.</li>
    <li> I have used it twice since I&#x27;ve got it and it&#x27;s wonderful, I see a huge improvement all around, it pulled out the blackheads , it takes away breakouts! It&#x27;s great, I will buy again! Thank you !!</li>
    <li> I love this mask! This mask is better than Glam Glo and much more reasonably priced. It is also a much bigger container than Glam Glo.  Shipping was fast and the company followed up with me to ensure I received it and was pleased. Wow! I thought customer service like that was long gone. I&#x27;ll definitely keep ordering!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty nice face mask. I wouldn&#x27;t pay $40 for it but $20 was reasonable.</li>
    <li> This got rid of EVERY blackhead that I had in one use! I forgot how clear my skin could look.  EDIT- a few months later this made my skin burn and turn bright red! and i had a breakout right after.</li>
    <li> I was using the outrageously expensive  Glamglow mudmask for a few months before deciding it wasn&#x27;t worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched for other highly rated masks and decided to give this one a try. I really love the smell and texture of it. It is incredibly easy to spread on (I usually use a clean wet foundation brush to put the mask on and just rinse it evenly) and also very easy to wipe off with a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it has definitely helped my oily skin and I think my blemishes are reducing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using the product once a week (with conservation in mind) but I think in order to see the improvements the mask is really capable of I&#x27;m going to bump it up to twice a week. Hence the 4 stars. It may very well be worth 5...</li>
    <li> Very good would buy again</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I lIke the Product feels great on my face and does not over dry and a Little does go a long way keep up the good job Thank You :-) &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This mask is very affordable, improves the clarity and texture of my skin after each use, works well as a full mask or spot treatment, it can be a little drying, though. I do recommend using a moisturizer after this or any other clay mask. This product is definitely comparable to the &#x27;Glam Glow&#x27; mud mask, which sells for $70.</li>
    <li> I think this is one of the best investments I have made for my skin. This mud is fantastic. Traditionally I&#x27;ve made m own bentonite clay mask (using just the clay and water - simple), and it&#x27;s really good! But I decided to give this a try because I wanted a more nourishing deep cleanse for my face while keeping it holistic and natural. So I purchased this product and am so glad that I did! It felt cool when I applied the product to my face (I loved the deep blue color of it), and it smelled refreshing and fresh. Unlike my plain bentonite clay masks, when this mask dried, it did not feel super hard and tight! But it was definitely effective! My face was much brighter and more fresh looking -- it left my skin looking and feeling more vibrant! I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this and I intend to purchase even more. I had never heard of LAVO before purchasing this mask and their exfoliator, but now I am truly and sincerely hoping that they continue to make more amazing, holistic, natural skin care products! #InLove #BestDecisionEver</li>
    <li> This product does a very nice job. I use it about once a week and feel like my face is cleaner and smoother.</li>
    <li> I am 53 years old and have combination skin.  I also have sensitive skin.  I purchased a different LAVO product for my daughter (who has oily skin) and shipped it to her at college.  She was so happy with it that I thought I would try one too.  This cleans my skin without drying.  To use, I just clean my skin before with a facial wipe, put on the mask as directed in a thin layer and leave it until it starts cracking and then after removing the mask I use an oil free moisturizer.  After using the mask my skin feels tighter and toned.  I use it as recommended, twice a week.</li>
    <li> I really like the LAVO mud mask. The clear and clean feeling after application is satisfying. I cannot say that it works as a magic with my pores. But after regular application of the mask two times a week, I started to see better results in a month. So try it, you will not regret.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts about this mask because: (1) it was a brand i&#x27;ve never heard of before (2) the packaging wasn&#x27;t all that &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, LAVO is an example of how brand names don&#x27;t mean anything. After the first use, I felt the difference right away! my skin felt rejuvenated and it made my skin feel so clean and smooth. I was pleasantly surprised by how effective and good this mask is.</li>
    <li> Love using this stuff! You can see it absorb the oils from your pores and it leaves your skin silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I really like the mud mask! I just used it for the second time&lt;br /&gt;earlier this afternoon. I previously used GLAMGLOW Face mud and I really liked&lt;br /&gt;it but it was very pricey. It did a great job of cleaning out blackheads, and I&lt;br /&gt;feel that the LAVO mask did not do quite as good a job in that area, but it&lt;br /&gt;makes my skin really nice otherwise. Plus the price is great. I plan to continue&lt;br /&gt;using your product to see what the long term benefits do and I would like to try&lt;br /&gt;others when I have the time and money to shop and see what else you offer. I&lt;br /&gt;have tried many other products and your quality is great. I also recommended it&lt;br /&gt;to a friend. Thanks for checking in. Keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> favorite face mask highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These are my wife&#x27;s observations of the mud mask. To her, the Lavo Detoxifying mud mask feels a little sticky on her face. It has a fragrance not typical of most mud masks (kind of minty). The smell isn&#x27;t unpleasant but she neither likes nor dislikes. (I like the smell of this mud mask better than the other brands she has tried.) The mud mask dries on the face quickly, is gentle and didn&#x27;t irritate her skin. The mud masks didn&#x27;t dry out her skin but it helped bring out the blackheads and clogged pores. Of the two mud masks that she has tried from Lavo, she likes this one just slightly better due to it feeling less sticky and was slightly more effective on the clogged pores, although she likes both masks for slightly different purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great mask so far&lt;br /&gt;Good for oily skin&lt;br /&gt;Shrinks pimple size&lt;br /&gt;Use a toner right after to soothe the skin</li>
    <li> Love it. Makes my pores look smaller</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness. I don’t say this lightly. It’s out of this world. It works. It feels great on. It doesn’t get too stiff! The smell is heavenly. It makes me feel like I’m at a spa (this one time I went to a stunning spa in Arizona -for free- and yeah, this mask reminds me of that experience!). Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also sent a lush facial scrub that doesn’t feel too gritty but still has lots of good scrubbing action. Do I recommend? Um, totally.</li>
    <li> the mask its easy to apply,work great in normal and oily skin you see the result in the first application,remove the oil without drying the skin,it feel smooth and clear blackheads but i think  it is  a little strong for sensitive skin,my skin is combination,i have T zone and work great for me,i love it</li>
    <li> Best mask I&#x27;ve tried. Great customer service, very impressed.</li>
    <li> Nice mask, does the trick!</li>
    <li> I have never used a mask before so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect. Just to make things a little silly, I had my boyfriend try it too. It smells very clean and it&#x27;s easy to apply to my face and neck. The texture is nice, too. I left it on my face for about 10 minutes and noticed that you could see tiny dots where my pores were. This mask seriously takes out all the oils under your skin. It was easy to wash off in the shower with some soap. I looked in the mirror and could instantly see a difference. All the tiny dots and huge pores I had on my face were a lot smaller! I was so happy at the results. I love this mask and I&#x27;ll definitely buy more when I run out. The honey almond scrub is a good bonus, too. Since it sucked all the oils out of my skin I needed to exfoliate all the dead skin off my face has never felt softer.</li>
    <li> If you have ever seen any of my other post about beauty products you know the love/hate relationship I have with my skin. I now have a pre-teen daughter and want to help teach her how to take care of her skin. I have past my love for skin products on to her and we were both excited to try this and rid ourselves of those nasty little black things on our noses. First things first--LAVO has a very clean smell to it. It has a smooth, cool feel and is not gritty. It&#x27;s very easy to apply and ready to use right out of the tube. When the mud mask is drying, it feels tingly and tight. After washing the mask off my faces the results were AWESOME! My Pores were smaller, the blackheads on my nose were gone, my skin was soft and smooth and I had a nice pink-ish glow. Right now I am using the mask 1 day a week and enjoy it. I have had no issues with it drying my skin or any reaction. I really like it a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I love this mask! And the company has amazing customer service. My skin has cleared up a lot since I started using it</li>
    <li> The description says that you get 4 oz and I received a 2 oz jar. There is no way to contact the people who are selling this. I feel like I got wripped off.</li>
    <li> My girls and I tried out this mud mask. It has a great consistency that makes it very easy to apply. Simply rub it all over your skin then wait 15 minutes and remove it. Take a shower to do so because it makes a mess and takes a while to get all traces of gray removed from your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved how it made my skin feel. So clean and soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Easy to use/apply and doesn&#x27;t dry up (hard) on your face.  It does tighten and reduce appearance of large pores and it brightens my complexion. A little bit goes a long way.  It works well with my oily skin.  Works great to use for spot break out issues.  The product is very worth the price that PRIME members get when using it  (therefore I have chosen and will continue to use it instead of other masks) otherwise the price is comparable to my other favorite masks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok...much like all the other facial masks out there.</li>
    <li> When we buy a product like this we all expect miracles, well miracles don&#x27;t exist but this mask is the best one that i&#x27;ve tried so far. You will in fact notice differences in your face the first time you use it and you will see the oil that was inside your face coming, in my personal experience it is helping with spots and superficial acne. I&#x27;m not sure how this would work with people that have cystic acne but I would give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember as most masks that remove oil and impurities this will make your face a bit dry (although significantly less than other masks), use moisturizer (for people with acne and oil issues I would recommend la roche posay effaclar MAT to use daily, it won&#x27;t clog your pores and it will prevent your skin from looking oily through out the day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to remove, doesn&#x27;t smell, and overall Im very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!! My face is super smooth. Also love that you don&#x27;t need a lot-- this is going to last me a long time.!</li>
    <li> I love this mud mask. I use this faithfully once a week to pamper and totally exfoliate and cleanse my face since I cant always go to a spa for a facial. The smell is very pleasant and I love how my skin looks and feels afterwards.</li>
    <li> This does nothing for my face really. I used as directed, but it doesn&#x27;t do what it is described to do. Just not for me.</li>
    <li> This is the very first mud mask I have ever tried and I have to say that I&#x27;m quite pleased with it. I&#x27;ve used it about 3 times so far and I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance afterwards. Nevertheless, my face is always very soft once I wash it off and the smell is heavenly. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll purchase again because it&#x27;s not worth over $30 w/ shipping but overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> Mask smells really nice and natural, is mild on the skin, and I have been enjoying it as a face and body mask (for legs arms). My ONLY complaint would be that it is kind of a pain to wash off compared to other mud masks I&#x27;ve tried. Shipping was super fast, company was easy to work with. I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> LAVO’s Ultra Detoxifying Mud Mask was designed to treat acne, blackheads, oily skin, psoriasis, eczema, wrinkles and bumpy skin! It came with a sample sized Honey Almond Scrub, which is a nice compliment to the mask. The mask is made with natural mud from The Dead Sea and The Mediterranean Sea. It contains great key ingredients like Ginseng, Hops, Burdock Root, Rosemary Leaves Extract, Sage Leaves Extract, Hyaluronic Acid, Aloe Vera, Jojoba Oil and Squalene!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask was really easy and fun to use! All I did was apply a thin layer to my entire face, avoiding my eye area. I left it on for 15 minutes, then rinsed it off with warm water. It has a really pretty color to it, which made it less of an eye sore to wear. I actually was complimented on my eyes, which was weird, but also nice! The mask has a very pleasant scent that made me feel relaxed and at ease. It dried up nicely, and washed off easily. Afterward, my skin felt soothed and detoxified. I love the added hydration without the excess oil! There is a large difference in the production of oils on my face! I definitely recommend this mask if you have normal to oily skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: (I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
    <li> WISH I FOUND OUT ABOUT PRODUCT YEARS AGO, MY PORES ARE LOVING THIS PRODUCT, THE BEST, WILL BE REODERING PRODUCT SOON....... DONT WANT TO RUN OUT,  A LITTLE&lt;br /&gt; GOES A LONG WAY.......&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This product really cleaned my pores. Also, it has a very nice smell. An efficient and easy treatment for the skin.</li>
    <li> I love that this mask is even stronger than the first. It gives my skin an instant lift and leaves it noticeably clearer after only the first use. I do have some residual redness after using the mask but that is the norm for me with almost all masks and it fades away completely in about 30-45 minutes. I would not recommend LAVO Ultra Detoxifying Mud Mask for anyone with sensitive skin or skin prone to breakouts. People with those skin type should probably stick to the Volcanic Mud Mask.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a sample of this product for the purposes of evaluation and review. All opinions are my own and I was not compensated for my review.</li>
    <li> So far since I&#x27;ve started using this product, I can see a huge difference. I love it and DEFINITELY recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> Great mask ! can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t help in detoxification or clearing out acne marks as it promises, but is a decent mud mask nevertheless.  I am still in my 20s, so won&#x27;t be able to comment on the anti-aging properties as I do not yet have any visible signs of aging.</li>
