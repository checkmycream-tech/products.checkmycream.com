      <li>Bare escentuals is really a great product.  </li>

<li> Even though it&#x27;s not a larger amount it goes a long way.</li>
<li> It helps with the oily spots and doesn&#x27;t look flaky or caked on the dry spots.</li>
<li> I will not use any other make up product.</li>
<li> I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t come with the twist-lock top as described</li>
<li> Lasts a long time as you use very little each day.</li>
<li> and I can&#x27;t close it tight.</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s a mess to open and difficult to get just a bit of the powder in the cap.</li>
<li> I love the product but the packaging is awful!  </li>

    <li> Pay close attention to the size of the item before you make a purchase.</li>
    <li> I will not use any other make up product.</li>
    <li> I love the BE product line, it&#x27;s the only makeup that I trust for my sensitive skin! It helps with the oily spots and doesn&#x27;t look flaky or caked on the dry spots.

    <li> Have used this product for years. Goes on with a soft brush and good coverage. So light you won&#x27;t know your wearing foundation at all. Seems to help smooth out wrinkles to some extent. Lasts a long time as you use very little each day.</li>
    <li> I tried 6 of these colors and even went back and forth and could never find a shade that blended. Meanwhile, I have never had any problem with any other brand or type of foundation getting a good color. The powder also doen&#x27;t blend in too well. You can definately see chalky like flakes on people&#x27;s skin, I guess that&#x27;s the minerals. And it doesn&#x27;t hide pores. I&#x27;d love to be able to use this for the natural benefit but just not working out.</li>
    <li> Bare escentuals is really a great product.  It hides the blemishes without the cake-y feeling on my face.  I prefer not to wear make-up but when I do this is my go-to brand</li>
    <li> Made my daughter breakout and so I tried it and it did the same to me.  My face got itchy and bumpy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Bare Minerals Foundation.  I love the lightweight feel and how easily it blends with your natural skin tone.  After applying the foundation, it appears as though you aren&#x27;t wearing any makeup at all!</li>
    <li> The best foundation I have used so far!</li>
    <li> I love the product but the packaging is awful!  The top gets breaks in it and I can&#x27;t close it tight. I have to put a rubber band around so it won&#x27;t spill all over.&lt;br /&gt;Keep the product - fix the cheap packaging.!!!</li>
    <li> I used to purchase this product from the manufacturer. When I found it available at Amazon for more than a 50% savings I immediately placed an order. I thought it might be outdated packaging, but it was perfect with the twist closure which is such an improvement from the original containers. Also, my package was received in 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;5 star service!!</li>
    <li> I thought the package was much smaller that I bought at Sephora but otherwise the product was the same</li>
    <li> Very dissatisfied with the size.  I can get a better deal on amazon.</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping and she was happy</li>
    <li> Even though it&#x27;s not a larger amount it goes a long way. It really prevents sun damage on my face when I ride my Harley. My face never burns!!!!!</li>
    <li> i love this stuff! Thank you</li>
    <li> Still reordering this after 10 years. Love it!</li>
