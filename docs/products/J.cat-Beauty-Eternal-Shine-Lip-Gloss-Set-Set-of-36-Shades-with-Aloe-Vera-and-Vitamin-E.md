      <li>We really liked them and took the extras home to use.</li>
      <li>The pigmented glosses are my favorite, and if you put on two layers it looks even better!</li>
      <li>I have to talk to a lot of people at my job too) and it goes on very smooth, no streaks.</li>
      <li>These are fabulous!</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be buying lip stuff for a while! :)</li>
      <li>Still love the colors though</li>
      <li>I love the colors and the gloss</li>
      <li>I love lip gloss</li>
      <li>They are cruelty free!</li>
      <li>I find every color matches tube, and so many color choices.</li>
      <li>Totally fabulous colors and pigmentation!  </li>
      <li>The colors were all different and so nice and the gloss was actually good feeling and lasted.</li>
      <li>Got it earlier than said it would be here lots of beautiful colors haven&#x27;t used yet waiting for the rest of my stuff to come in</li>
      <li>it would maybe look fine for an hour (that is being somewhat generous).  </li>
      <li>Nice colors, super creamy and most colors are highly pigmented!</li>
      <li>Enjoy the variety of colors.</li>
      <li>Overall it was a great buy.</li>
      <li>but some are better than the others but other than that there great</li>
      <li>so I was excited to try this collection.  </li>
      <li>My absolute favorite set of lip gloss and colors</li>
      <li>its somewhat sheer, but also gives good color.</li>
      <li>Overall, i loved it.</li>
      <li>Love the selection, super fast shipping</li>
      <li>I have fair skin and thin lips so &amp;#34;bold&amp;#34; lips don&#x27;t look to good on me</li>
      <li>This did arrive quickly and was packaged well - this is a side note</li>
      <li>Great for the price but some of the lip glosses are very light and don&#x27;t last long</li>
      <li>The application instrument is the foam brush, where I would prefer a different applicator (the kind that resembles the nail polish brush-</li>
      <li>Worth buying</li>
      <li>but the colors don&#x27;t come out right</li>
      <li>where some of the colors are highly pigmented, some go on kind of sheer, it is the color of the bottle</li>
      <li>I dont think im buying more because with this set i have 36 lipglosses that will last like...</li>
      <li>but most can last all day</li>
      <li>Almost all of the colors are pretty sheer (even the dark reds, bright pinks and purple).</li>
      <li>They are smooth without being sticky and last!</li>
      <li>I  did not realize how much lip gloss you get with this set.</li>
      <li>Very pigmented and the color lasts for hours.</li>
      <li>On me, the color looks much lighter than it does in the tube.</li>
      <li>Whereas you can go to walmart/ulta/bath &amp; body works &amp; spend $10 or more on just ONE lipgloss, some of the colors are very pigmented, these glosses are also long lasting (wore it for 6hrs</li>
      <li>And you do really need to reapply frequently.  </li>
      <li>There are some colors that are just weird to me, but those could look great on someone else.</li>
      <li>Pretty colors but not long wearing.</li>
      <li>For the shear amount of different colors you get, I really can&#x27;t complain about the price.</li>
      <li>The lipgloss size isnt sample size or full size either, but big enough to where you can wear that color multiple times and still not run out.  </li>
      <li>These glosses are very, very sheer nearly clear 98% of them</li>
      <li>I guess these are smaller tubes than i thought they would be - although the size is clearly listed in the description.  </li>
      <li>Many of the tube openings have broken.</li>
      <li>To note- some colors are very very similar - even when put right next to each other</li>
      <li>but when I opened these my immediate thought went to that these would be fantastic to divide up and give as little gifts with some other girly stuff to female friends or family members.</li>

<li> We put them with Mini Salon Board Nail Files and Burt&#x27;s Bee lip balm in small boxes for gifts to attendees at our baby shower.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Dose not stay for long time</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite set of lip gloss and colors I have ever owned. I read the other reviews about the colors not having color and they are just a glos,I do not find that to be the case at all. I find every color matches tube, and so many color choices. I love the colors and the gloss, I do not need any lipsticks with this product. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Love them, good selection of colors to choose from, nice smell and love their texture, is not greasy nor sticky, just perfect to wear by themselves or with lipstick under! And the best of this product? They are cruelty free! I dont think im buying more because with this set i have 36 lipglosses that will last like... Forever! But i would buy them again! I totally recomend them! Great for presents too, but if i could change anything, it would be the packaging... Not surprised at all, They come in 6 little boxes with 6 lipglosses each,  i wish they came in a nice box or bag, but they all came in perfect shape so i guess it does the job...</li>
    <li> These are fabulous! They are smooth without being sticky and last!</li>
    <li> Totally fabulous colors and pigmentation!  I am truly impressed!</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! Great product and value for the cost</li>
    <li> Pretty colors but not long wearing.</li>
    <li> Enjoy the variety of colors. They are lighter than I expected and I had to reapply them often. Still love the colors though</li>
    <li> Okay these are AMAZING!! Very pigmented and the color lasts for hours.</li>
    <li> Got it earlier than said it would be here lots of beautiful colors haven&#x27;t used yet waiting for the rest of my stuff to come in so I can use</li>
    <li> These glosses are very nice.  Some of the caps weren&#x27;t screwed on very tightly and they don&#x27;t have a safety/security seal which bothers me a bit.  It doesn&#x27;t seem like they were used (the inside lip/edge that wipes off excess color wasn&#x27;t touched with color, so the wand was never pulled out of the tube).  There is a wide variety of colors (no repeats).  Almost all of the colors are pretty sheer (even the dark reds, bright pinks and purple). If you want opaque color, you&#x27;ll need to use a lipstick under the gloss.</li>
    <li> its great and the coloring package I got fits from day to evening. wonderful</li>
    <li> Overall it was a great buy. Pros- you get SO SO many lipglosses for an unbeatable price! Whereas you can go to walmart/ulta/bath &amp; body works &amp; spend $10 or more on just ONE lipgloss, some of the colors are very pigmented, these glosses are also long lasting (wore it for 6hrs and it still looked great &amp; i didnt even touch up! I have to talk to a lot of people at my job too) and it goes on very smooth, no streaks. Some are shimmery and some arent. A lot are almost the same color just different shades  Cons- where some of the colors are highly pigmented, some go on kind of sheer, it is the color of the bottle but some are a bit sheer with a sort of &amp;#34;hue&amp;#34; of whatever the color is. The lipgloss size isnt sample size or full size either, but big enough to where you can wear that color multiple times and still not run out.  Overall, i loved it. I would definitely purchase again. You get a lot for your money! The pigmented glosses are my favorite, and if you put on two layers it looks even better! I really love the nude colors as well, they go very good with my caramel complexion.</li>
    <li> Love the selection, super fast shipping</li>
    <li> I love lip gloss so I was excited to try this collection.  Feels nice on my lips and looks great. I won&#x27;t be buying lip stuff for a while! :)</li>
    <li> Worth buying but the colors don&#x27;t come out right</li>
    <li> For the shear amount of different colors you get, I really can&#x27;t complain about the price. However, this is still somewhat different than I expected.  I guess these are smaller tubes than i thought they would be - although the size is clearly listed in the description.  At a glance, I do like the majority of the colors as they are in the tube. There are some colors that are just weird to me, but those could look great on someone else. To note- some colors are very very similar - even when put right next to each other the difference is minimal - i don&#x27;t know if you could tell the difference when on.  I have only tried about three different colors. On me, the color looks much lighter than it does in the tube. The application instrument is the foam brush, where I would prefer a different applicator (the kind that resembles the nail polish brush- I don&#x27;t know the name of this).  I will say this gloss does feel a bit tacky/sticky when put on.  And you do really need to reapply frequently.  I would say if you just had this on and did not drink/eat anything etc.. it would maybe look fine for an hour (that is being somewhat generous).  With that said, for the price, you can afford to reapply.  I can&#x27;t really say I&#x27;m thrilled with this purchase, but I&#x27;m not super disappointed either.  This did arrive quickly and was packaged well - this is a side note but when I opened these my immediate thought went to that these would be fantastic to divide up and give as little gifts with some other girly stuff to female friends or family members.</li>

    <li> I  did not realize how much lip gloss you get with this set. I will never need to buy more! its somewhat sheer, but also gives good color. I have fair skin and thin lips so &amp;#34;bold&amp;#34; lips don&#x27;t look to good on me but these are perfect. not too sticky. perfect for gifts... I have them as party favors for a bridal shower and the ladies LOVED them!. I would recommend these if you just want a small pop of color</li>
    <li> Great colors,stays on but not to sticky!</li>
    <li> Nice colors, super creamy and most colors are highly pigmented!</li>
    <li> great price and quality</li>
    <li> They are great. We put them with Mini Salon Board Nail Files and Burt&#x27;s Bee lip balm in small boxes for gifts to attendees at our baby shower. The colors were all different and so nice and the gloss was actually good feeling and lasted. So many for a great price. We really liked them and took the extras home to use.</li>
    <li> Only had this product for a week but it does appear to be very good. I would recommend it to others.</li>
