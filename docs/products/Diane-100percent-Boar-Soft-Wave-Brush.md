<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Size selection is not clear.  The values provided do not tell you the size of the brush.</li>
    <li> OMG it works so great on my clear hair!  I&#x27;ve had the hardest time finding a brush that is gentle enough not to remove too many of my clear hairs from my balding pate and this is it!!  You will NEVER find a hair in this brush after using it!  It could also be used to keep wild air hairs in order - as long as you don&#x27;t have any!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously - this should not be called a brush, and I have yet to meet a boar with bristles this wimpy.  What are they feeding them these days?</li>
    <li> If you can get this a a bargain price, buy it. I have thin hair and this is just the thing. I have been doing a no-&amp;#34;Poo&amp;#34; regime for the past few months. My head feels great; scalp and hair feel better than they have for years. I have had more than fifty years of living and can&#x27;t believe I never used a boar bristle brush before now. I always just picked up whatever nylon bristle brush was laying around. Never again, it is boar bristle from here on out. Boar bristle, baking soda and apple cider vinegar; you will feel like you have gone to a fancy spa, yet spent only pennies.</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical about this brush, but I&#x27;ve wanted to try a soft bristle brush for a long time. My hair is extremely curly and dry, and my regular brush and even wide tooth combs tug painfully at my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this one before I go to bed to distribute natural oil and take out some of my less messy bits, and I&#x27;ve already noticed a huge difference combing my hair in the morning. My knots are easier to detangle and my hair feels less brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything that makes my hair easier to manage is a win in my book, so this brush is a definite win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, if you&#x27;re buying this brush to replace a regular one ... don&#x27;t. It won&#x27;t pull knots out of your hair. That isn&#x27;t what it&#x27;s for.</li>
    <li> Its true to its softness. I have 4b/c hair and when I use a leave in with some coconut oil and use this brush on my edges just to smooth the hair out, it works every time. Also use it on my little sister with 4a hair and it works like a charm for her flyaways.</li>
    <li> This brush is good for smoothing without adding static electricity.  It really doesn&#x27;t do anything for removing tangles. It is a good sized brush and works well with my long hair.</li>
    <li> I had been using a boar&#x27;s bristle brush for I forget how long, but it was ready for retirement. When I searched Amazon, I decided on this one because the description and reviews said it would smooth the hair and give it a sheen. I have fine hair that tends to frizz up and fly all over my face when wind or fan is on it. The problem with this brush is the bristles are not suited for digging deep into my hair and getting out mats formed by the wind. It does give my hair a nice finish, but I find problems in the back of my neck where the bristles cannot reach no matter how hard I push while brushing. It has done so-so for a year or so but I do need to get busy and choose a brush at Amazon or a local grocery store that will work out better for me than this one, and it will likely have wild boar bristles as all my older ones did.</li>
    <li> Too soft. Had to give it away!!!!</li>
    <li> I thought hair was falling in the sink, but it was brush bristles.</li>
    <li> This brush is cute- bought for my 5-year old- but it&#x27;s so soft that the bristles only brush the surface of her hair, leaving many knots underneath that never get touched.</li>
    <li> The Blacker the Berry the sweeter the juice...This applies to women, fruit, and This applies to Brushes as well. This brush is the ish, it&#x27;s deff my new fav brush.. I see why everybody be going crazy over them Dirty Diana&#x27;s... This brush is deff good for them connections and and laying the hair down.. It feel so good on your head that it makes you wanna brush even more... I&#x27;m thinkin about getting the palm brush version of the 8169 and the medium (I believe the 8157 it is), cause now i&#x27;m on week 6 of wolfin and i need to get that extra lay-down if you know what I mean. Also I recieved the brush in the mail fairly quick, and in good condition.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t on my hair (thick and wavy) but my boss asked me for it (short and ethnic) and he loves it.</li>
    <li> The bristles keep falling out</li>
    <li> This did absolutely nothing to my hair (no matter how small I section it, it is too soft to brush through).  I have long hair and I was looking for a brush to shine my hair with by brushing it softly every night before bed (I&#x27;ve been reading a lot of fantasy novels lately and wanted to feel like a fair maiden brushing my hair out, haha!)</li>
    <li> I was shocked to find the sea of little black boar hairs after I tried brushing my hair. The bristles are falling out every time I use it! I thought maybe it&#x27;s an initial loose bristles but it looks like it&#x27;s continuous as it happens each time I go over it with my hand. The only thing these bristles could withstand is perhaps brushing a very weak air current. I have been using the Mason Pearson mixture brush and I wanted to try 100% boar bristle brush at a lower cost since I have thick hair and the mixture brush is my main anyway. As I stated before, the bristles fall out even when I just sweep over with it with my hand so it&#x27;s not because of my thick hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a massage brush for skin brushing and it could not be a better brush. The bristles are strong enough to give you a great massage but not so hard that it is uncomfortable if you want to really put some pressure on for therapeutic scrubbing and circulation stimulation.  It also works really well on fine hair and scalp massage.</li>
    <li> Too soft for me to use, and I have rather thin hair. I think it would be better for a toddler or child with very thin hair. However, it does appear to be well-made, and the price couldn&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Like other reviews, the brush hairs are too soft, and can&#x27;t function as a normal brush to make your hair look good in the morning.  I&#x27;m not sure how people use it to distribute oil to the end of the hair, as it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair together.</li>
    <li> Great quality and size for our Yorkie.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this brush are way too soft. I could not actually brush it through my hair. Went to a store and bought one that had stiffer bristles for 2 1/2 times the price as this one but it works. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this brush again.</li>
    <li> This brushes down the frizz, but doesn&#x27;t untangle anything</li>
    <li> It supossed to be like the photo? All the bristles came down!!!! Is this normal?</li>
    <li> I am not happy with this brush I&#x27;ve had better in the past bristles are too soft doesn&#x27;t do anything for my 3b curly hair.</li>
    <li> spreads the oils down my hair for the last several months. i wash my hair once a month or less. i have long thick wavy-curly hair.</li>
    <li> My favorite all around wave brush for maintaining 360 waves.  This is a must have for wavers maintaing 360 waves.</li>
    <li> I have super straight semi thick hair and this brush really does make it super shiny! It won&#x27;t help with tangles at all but if you just use it to massage your scalp then gently bring it down your hair it makes it sooo shiny and healthy!</li>
    <li> This brush is great. It&#x27;s much more gentle than my other BBB.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 5 year old granddaughter, who at the time had long hair.  It worked very well to smooth and untangle her hair without splitting it as nylon bristles will do.  Since she decided to cut her hair to chin length while I thought she was taking a nap it&#x27;s now too wide, so I use it on the cat.  Makes a great cat brush!  I intend to buy one for the dogs and one for my horses. The narrower handle will make it easier to use on the horses than the usual type of natural bristle brush.  I will be looking for a Diane round brush for my granddaughter now!</li>
    <li> I guess I was looking for a different brush, too soft for my hair.  But my husband loves it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good brush for my waves, it&#x27;s not to hard or to soft fix in my hand perfect. Great Price!</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a spare brush to carry in my backpack for winter days where I wear a hat to work and I need to make it not stand up when I get there. This was excellent!</li>
    <li> Brush was a little bigger then I expected and the bristles are extremely soft, I&#x27;ll keep the brush though, might come in handy one day.</li>
    <li> This is a good brush, but has very soft bristles. So if you have normal to coarse hair, this prob won&#x27;t be much help. Thin hair would work perfect with this brush.</li>
    <li> This brush is very soft and will not go through my hair so for me its not good but I do have thick hair. The brush also seems to be losing a lot of its bristles but it does make my hair shiny.</li>
    <li> This brush is incredibly soft and gives a nice smooth finish to my hair. I can&#x27;t believe the quality that I received for the low price that I paid! One or two bristles fall out of the brush, each time I use it, but I think that is to be expected.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would untangle knots in my long hair but... I feel like it don&#x27;t do anything for me . anyways I think this is a great brush for older people and for those who have short hair like men do  or elder men or women .</li>
    <li> Great brush for my boys .</li>
    <li> I should have read the reviews before purchasing this hair brush.  I took it out of the carton and rubbed my hand against the brush and it started to lose bristles.  I continued to rub and it just continued to lose bristles.  I showed my wife and she was not impressed.  It still continues to lose bristles and I now have a nice pile of little black bristles.  Poor brush and poor choice on my part!</li>
    <li> If your looking to enhance your waves this is one of the brushes of the series that you will definitely.</li>
    <li> This brush has soft bristles, it smooths hair nicely without destroying waves, it nicely distributes hair oils, the wooden handle is easy to hold while styling and will not cause static that could lead to dry or frizzy hair, it&#x27;s affordable. A very nice brush.</li>
    <li> Way too soft.  My hair isn&#x27;t even that thick, but this didn&#x27;t brush through it very well.  The bristles seemed like they might fall out.</li>
    <li> This brush is a nice quality brush, but unfortunately it is too soft to brush my hair. Like another reviewer said, this brush would be good for a child or an adult with very fine hair.   Laura</li>
    <li> The brush is okay. I have my doubts as to whether it&#x27;s 100% boar, especially at this price point. Some of the bristles look like nylon--they have an evenness to them and the tips are rounded in a  way that makes me think they were manufactured. It&#x27;s also not super soft as advertised. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a medium to medium soft brush. For the price it&#x27;s definitely worth trying.</li>
    <li> My son has short hair, but doesn&#x27;t like to use my boar bristle brush because it is too hard.  He likes this brush because it is much softer on his head.</li>
    <li> He has short hair. Not sure how it would work on mine, mine is a lot longer. But my husband uses it every day and likes how &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; and smooth it makes his hair. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST BRUSH, FOR  FINE  HAIR ITS A  GREAT BRUSH ,  GOOD QUALITY...!GREAT PRICE  AND  FAST SHIPPING...!!!  ; )  THANKS...!!!!!  IM  VERY HAPPY....!!!AND THIS BRUSH  AND IS  KIND TO MY HAIR ...! THATS THE BEST PART...!!!</li>
    <li> A prior purchase that I used quite a bit.  Another brush was ordered because someone else wanted to use it.</li>
    <li> If you have thick, unruly hair, this is not the brush for getting it laid down or styled. Use this bruSh after detangling and product application if you need to smooth it or brush out curls. Or if you tend to be rough, this will minimize damaging and breakage on fragile strands or tender scalps.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ price&lt;br /&gt;+ great for smoothing&lt;br /&gt;+ helps prevent split ends&lt;br /&gt;+ works well as a brush for small children and babies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- definitely doesn&#x27;t seem like 100% boar bristle&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t brush hair; doesn&#x27;t rid hair of tangles (although that&#x27;s not really the purpose of this brush according to my research)&lt;br /&gt;- soft to a fault; wouldn&#x27;t recommend to someone with exceedingly thick hair</li>
    <li> This brush is excellent.  It is super soft and nicely smooths my wavy/ curly hair when I style it.  It is also gentle on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for anyone with wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a good brush for my cats and I found it. Wouldn&#x27;t use it for myself but a huge hit with my felines.</li>
    <li> I bought this while in search of a good boar-bristle brush to use while going pooless.  While the quality of the brush seems decent, it doesn&#x27;t perform as I need it to.  I have very thin hair that I keep around 1-2 inches long and I can&#x27;t reach my scalp at all with this brush.  I think the description should more adequately define the purpose of such a brush, which I can only guess is to achieve the &amp;#34;wave&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;360 wave&amp;#34; style on very short hair (should have Googled &amp;#34;wave brush&amp;#34; before buying).  This brush only slides along the surface of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the quality is very good for such a cheap brush.  I don&#x27;t have many bristles falling out and the bristles seem to be good quality.  It&#x27;s a shame that Diane doesn&#x27;t make 100% boar brushes with firmer bristles to act as a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; brush (they only have &amp;#34;reinforced&amp;#34; brushes with mostly synthetic bristles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an actual (regular) brush I HIGHLY recommend the Bass brush men&#x27;s club style 100% wild boar bristle ($12 at time of this review).  It has much longer and firmer bristles and does exactly what I need.</li>
    <li> Complete trash. This brush is terrible and breaks/pulls out my hair. I do not understand why this got good reviews. It is super cheap for a reason. When I opened my product some of the bristles look mashed, wirey, and used.</li>
    <li> Its too soft. Doesn&#x27;t brush my hair. I have thick hair an was looking for a brush similar to the Avon classic one, that I recently lost. Didn&#x27;t work out at all.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  The bristles as medium soft, not too firm/scratchy and not too soft.  The handle appears to be wood, painted black and the brush is larger than I expected.  Good for short hair, maybe short wavy hair you want to brush straighter (?)  Probably wouldn&#x27;t be effective on long/thick hair.  Good for fine hair.  Excellent product for the price.</li>
    <li> Great brush, very soft.</li>
    <li> The brush was softer than I anticipated. It&#x27;s really more for redistributing oil than for actual hair styling. That&#x27;s fine. I just didn&#x27;t know how soft they meant. However, the bristles fall off, which means one of their stars falls off the review. The wooden handle is good quality.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;Diane\\&quot; 100% boar bristles hair brush makes a great clothes brush....or a baby hair brush. Someone who is bald and wants a scalp massage would enjoy this hairbrush. Also, this is a great product if you want to brush your skin to slough off old cells before you take a shower.The boar bristles do not...I repeat, they do not penetrate the hair....it just sort of slides over your hair. Very frustrating. Bristles are SHORT. I was disappointed, but hey! I only paid $3.99 for it. You will be disappointed if you want this hairbrush to penetrate even a sparse head of hair. I shop \\&quot;Amazon\\&quot; regularly and I&#x27;m pleased with everything I&#x27;ve ordered, except one or two items...and this is one of them.</li>
    <li> I cannot use this, and I&#x27;m terribly disappointed. I wanted soft boar bristles, but not so soft it can&#x27;t get through my hair.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Does the trick. I use this brush to go over those pesky fly away hairs when putting my hair up.</li>
    <li> This brush does not even go through thick hair.  I think I will need to pass it on to someone with real thin hair</li>
    <li> best brush I ever had</li>
    <li> Great. The bristles were so fresh it was like receiving it straight from the assembly line. You don&#x27;t even get that freshness in stores. It even had that &amp;#34;new car smell&amp;#34; without being a car. 8169 is an essential for wavers and if you are going to get an 8169, I suggest you get it from this type of seller.</li>
    <li> I needed a good brush that will make my hair smooth once I comb it, this one works pretty well it is soft and never so abrasive as other brushes...</li>
    <li> Good, sturdy handle and very soft bristles although we needed something a bit more firm. True to look and softness described.</li>
    <li> Product as advertised....seems to be made well and I&#x27;m happy iwth it thus far.</li>
    <li> Good for short, thin hair, not for long or thick hair. Bristles feel great, but won&#x27;t go through hair longer than couple inches.</li>
    <li> Good brush.  It has held up well.  It was larger and honestly better than I thought it would be for the price so I bought a 2nd one for work.</li>
    <li> I have very thin curly soft hair and the bristles aren&#x27;t strong enough to brush through it. Good for cats though</li>
    <li> The brush works fine but is not as pictured. It&#x27;s mallet and squarer, just like one I already have. I bought this wanting a different one, and got the same thing. It is not as pictured.</li>
    <li> This brush does the job of brushing my hair well. Only problem is that it tends to really force the hair down flat. Good if that is your intention, but it is usually not my intention.</li>
    <li> This is a great soft brush for people with soft/fine hair, I have a lot of brushes from different companies , at different prices....this however is my favorite brush for the first week and a half after I get a low cut.</li>
    <li> I use on my dogs. They enjoy the soft feel.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Diane brushes. The saying you get what you pay for doesn&#x27;t apply to these brushes at all, you&#x27;re getting 15-25 dollar quality for a few bucks! First let me start with the benefits of the 100% boar bristles. This brush will make you hair extremely soft and shiny. I didn&#x27;t see it the first time I used it like some people but I&#x27;ve had this brush for about a month now and I can definitely tell a major difference when using it. I brush with my Diane hard brush 8159, then my Diane 8119, and I finish with this 8169. When I run my hand through my hair after using this brush it feels silky smooth, it lays my hair down, and I see some added shine! If you&#x27;re trying to get waves you HAVE to get this brush, besides all the benefits I&#x27;ve already mentioned it will help to connect your waves so you can get 360s. Another thing I like about this brush is that it&#x27;s a softee but the bristles are placed firmly in the wood so it feels soft but sturdy at the same time, it&#x27;s hard to explain but it feels great on your head. Some of the bristles may fall out the first couple of days you use it but that has been the case for almost every brush I&#x27;ve ever purchased. After the first couple of days though the shedding stops completely. This is the perfect soft brush BUY IT!</li>
    <li> I had red a lot of reviews about this brush, many of which compared it to Bass Boar Brush. Everyone has different tastes, but I can tell you that the brush I got had a black wooden handle, as opposed to the grey plastic one shown, as well as having very short and soft bristles. I found that for my medium length wavy man mane, this brush could hardly even manage my morning mange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this brush after taking a shower to shape, style and control my wavy locks, while volumizing a bit. For a stronger more aggressive brush, I use the Bass Club style brush. The Diane brush is ok, but Bass is far superior in quality and firmness.</li>
    <li> Some bristle lose, but a good price, i needed a little to push for free shipping so i got this. and i use this as a body brush (energy healing) and not on my hair so the bristle spillage isn&#x27;t that big of a deal (especially for the $$).</li>
    <li> I used this on a elderly family member, and she loves it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this brush, it suits my hair well and it&#x27;s pretty much everything i expected. I&#x27;d buy it again if i had to :)</li>
    <li> I got this item last week and was ver anxious to use it. Unfortunately I&#x27;m very disappointed with the quality, every time I use it it leaves my hair freeze and the bristles keep coming off the brush.</li>
    <li> The bristles are so flimsy they can&#x27;t even brush hair.</li>
    <li> This is a good brush and meets it description for soft hair.  I thought it was a quality product for the price.</li>
    <li> Very soft bristles, but too soft to go through thick hair. I use it to brush my clothes and jackets instead. The bristles haven&#x27;t started to fall out, and I&#x27;ve had it for a year. A good purchase if you want a brush for baby-fine hair.</li>
    <li> This brush loses so many bristles it clogged our sink really badly.  Horribly manufacturer.</li>
    <li> This is a Greg brush for those individuals who have just had a fresh cut and are looking for a brush to use while waving up...</li>
    <li> The bristles just keep falling out. very very soft</li>
    <li> The bristles are soft enough to not hurt my skin but are also stiff enough to brush out my beard well.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a brush to touch/massage your scalp, this is NOT the brush. If you&#x27;re wanting a brush that will go between the strands of your hair, this is NOT the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you want an EXTRA brush to put sheen in your hair, to glide OVER your hair rather than brush it, then this is your brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reviewers, the ones who gave this brush 5 stars, are right. This will not get tangles out. I personally don&#x27;t understand why a person needs 2 or 3 different hair brushes that do different things but that&#x27;s just not my style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, though, that is is very good quality. The bristles are soft and the handle feels like substantial wood.  But I really want a brush I can feel on my scalp, so this just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Very soft bristles .. too soft to even comb the hair</li>
    <li> The brush is just okay. I like the look and the soft bristles but the bristles are falling out.</li>
    <li> enjoy using it, whatever dandruff there is  it is gone after brushing with this fine brush..The handle could be a bit larger.</li>
    <li> it says 100% bbb but it doest feel like my other bbb. also the bristles are varied length and a few have fallen out before i even used it. the size is great. just hoping the quality is good too.</li>
    <li> The bristles are slightly softer than I would prefer, but they still get the job done.  My hair looks really lovely after using this brush.</li>
    <li> These brushes are hard to find anymore. I was thankful when I found this on Amazon. It is smooth and brushes through the hair softly. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Kelly</li>
    <li> It is a very soft brush.  It is well made and the bristles do not come out.  It is a good brush.</li>
    <li> It is plenty soft and works well, but I see an occasional bristle coming out; will wait a bit longer and report back if I remember.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair at all and what I do have is thin and fine.  That being said, this brush couldn&#x27;t even get past the top layer to brush my hair.  It just sort of bent over the top layer and smoothed it out.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Initial impression:  Meh.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is exactly as pictured - trouble is that the description doesn&#x27;t match.  It says there are soft bristles on one side and firm on the other - this is not true.  This brush is all soft.  I was looking for something that had both.  I&#x27;ll try this out to see if it works for what I need and update later.</li>
    <li> This is a SOFT BRUSH, I think meant for smoothing short hair. It did not work for me, but my husband will be able to use it. ;-)</li>
    <li> I like this, it works and especially soft on relaxed hair with gel. Very good product. One for life - perfect.</li>
    <li> The brush arrived promptly, well packaged, in perfect condition. I like the brush. It is a soft brush as I wished. It&#x27;s just the thing for my rapidly thinning hair. It removed unattached hair without pulling at hairs still growing on my head.</li>
    <li> This brush was far too soft like a baby brush, I expected boar bristles to be more firm and would penetrate through my hair, massaging my scalp when brushing.</li>
    <li> In addition to the uses stated, I find the brush good for gentle dermabrasion to exfolioate skin and help encourage growth of new skin cells.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for my kids! They use it to brush their hair and I finish and style with it as it catches all the hair and helps me to stye their hair.</li>
    <li> Sounds weird, but I bought this to clean leather products.  I have a boar bristle brush for applying shaving cream to my face, so my simpleton logic thought it&#x27;&#x27;d be ok to use this on everything from leather car seats, furniture, shoes, etc.  I love it and its fairly easy to clean.  It does a better job of using a leather cleaner and creating suds, from which I can wipe up the suds instead of pushing them further into the pores.  Or so I assume?</li>
    <li> I brought this for myself after chemo and my hair is just starting to grow back. Very nice hair brush and it feels great.</li>
    <li> too soft for long hair.  It felt like it was not grabbing my hair at all.  It might be good for very short hair.</li>
    <li> Great brush for the price. Larger than I even expected, if you are looking for a good boar bristle brush, this is the one for you!</li>
    <li> I like this brush alot. No complaints it gets the job done. I was debating between this and the crown, I feel I made the right decision.</li>
    <li> Love the brush. very soft and gives my hair the coiffed look without product. quite happy with it</li>
    <li> The bristles are so soft I can&#x27;t imagine who can use this as a brush. Though as a smoothing tool it works just fine if your hair is straight..</li>
    <li> The brush hairs coming off. A men&#x27;s brush but not good</li>
    <li> great brush use it all the time works good tyvm good item to get easy to clean easy to use</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how soft this brush was really going to be when I purchased it. It doesn&#x27;t even brush the outer part of my hair, and my hair is soft &amp; fine. Might be okay for a baby&#x27;s semi-bald head.. but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> If u want a soft Boar Bristle brush, then this is the one to get.</li>
    <li> Love this brush because it doesn&#x27;t tear through my tangled wavy hair, but instead it smooths and softens my hair. This is a great add-on item for those needing a new brush!</li>
    <li> Bought three of them. One for myself and one for each of our grand daughters. Leaves you hair feeling smooth and untangled. Get yours soon. You will be happy!!</li>
    <li> I assume it&#x27;s real boar bristle, you never know these days with &#x27;Made in China&#x27; but ... it&#x27;s a good brush.  Shed a lot the first few uses but then it settled down.  They clearly didn&#x27;t put it through a rigorous wash after making it, but that&#x27;s fine.  Does the job.</li>
    <li> First of all, if you&#x27;re looking for a brush to detangle your hair this is not it. That&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s intended for. This is for smoothing your hair and distributing your natural oil from your scalp to your hair. And it works great for that!  A must if you&#x27;re attempting the no-poo method (like me).&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick and wavy hair and I usually pin the top layer of my hair up and brush the bottom layer first and then let down the the top layer and brush that next.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you clean the brush weekly because it will collect your natural oil!</li>
    <li> Diane Wave Brush, 100% Soft Boar Bristles- I use to be a hair dresser and a Barber.  This is a very soft brush and very durable.  If you have sensitive skin and hair especially men, buy one, try it, write your review.</li>
    <li> This brush feels great on your head. Soft brush that you can brush with for hours if you wanted to.</li>
    <li> I would not buy this brush again.  The soft bristles are too soft, but if you are using this on a child&#x27;s hair it would work well I imagine. The bristles also come out very easily and each time I clean it or just try to brush my hair with it, I get about half a dozen or so bristles that fall out.  At this rate there eventually won&#x27;t be any left and you kind of need bristles for a brush to work.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I am an African-American female with natural hair: I wanted a brush to brush the strays on the perimeter of my head without pulling hair; this brush works perfect. My hair can break easily sometimes, especially when brushed with hard bristle brushes. A while ago I realized I needed to change what I brush my hair with--not just the hair products I use.  the soft bristles on the brush are really soft [though, not to soft] and tames my hair. This brush is pretty large (medium-sized) fits fine in my hand [from the picture I actually that it would be smaller]. I have the #D8169 model.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this brush makes my hair frizz, not smooth. If I spray Static Guard on it, then it does a nice job. I do use it to smooth out pony tails, etc. and it works well.</li>
    <li> The brush really a medium soft, but keeps my hair wavey and spinning.  This Lady Diane gives better than excellent head.</li>
    <li> I have curly, thick and found that this created more flyaway hair because I could only brush with a very light touch, the bristles collapsed with any amount of pressure.  I am much happier with the other low cost boar bristle brush I bought, Spornette Deville Cushion Boar Bristle Brush.  While neither are appropriate for styling the Spornette will go through all layers of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found this brush to be useful for my black labs as it is now the dog&#x27;s brush.</li>
    <li> This brush does what it is intended to do (and nothing more) for a great price! I see most of the negative reviews are based on people buying a soft brush and then complaining that it is too soft. Don&#x27;t rate items down just because you can&#x27;t read a description! This is just what a soft brush should be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, thick but fine curly hair which I only wash once or twice a week. It gets damaged very easily, so for the sake of keeping it long but manageable, I have to take certain steps. I use a comb to detangle it. THEN I use this soft brush to either smooth down flyaways when I put it up (it&#x27;s great for that) or to redistribute oils from my scalp to the ends of my hair before I go to sleep at night. It feels great on my scalp, too! Again, this is NOT a brush for getting tangles out, unless you are using it on an infant who doesn&#x27;t have that much hair. It is very good at what it is supposed to do, though.</li>
    <li> Fine quality with a nicely finished wood handle. Bristles are soft &amp; comfortable on my thinning hair. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent value brush. Good quality at a low price. Important: it is extremely soft. Think toothbrush bristles for comparison. This is the soft version. For most people, this brush is probably a poor choice. However, if you have very short or fine hair, it works great. It can be pressed against the scalp without discomfort and it pulls considerably less hair out than other brushes. Of course, the main reason to use a boar bristle brush is its ability to pull our natural oils from the scalp through our hair. Works great.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a brush I could use to brush oils from my scalp down through my hair. I didn&#x27;t expect something that would let me untangle my hair, just care for already untangled hair. Unfortunately, the bristles are so soft they bend. They won&#x27;t go through my (very fine, though medium-thick) hair down to even near the scalp. They do fine for running over the top of my hair and I suppose it would catch flyaway strands and pull them back in, but it won&#x27;t do for my purposes.</li>
    <li> Nice for my grand-baby hair</li>
    <li> Really nice brush, I use it to finish up after curling my hair. It gives it a natural looking beautiful look. This brush is amazing!</li>
    <li> Transitioning to natural, and this brush was highly recommended.  I love how soft it is and it gives me a piece of mind that I&#x27;m not damaging my hair when I brush through with it.  Because of the soft bristols it allows the oils, moisturizer, etc to get pulled through your strands evenly. Healthy hair at its finest.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it works for my hair. It made my hair look even frizzier than before. I use it on my infant. He seems to enjoy the massage.&lt;br /&gt;The softness is over rated. It feels like a scrub.</li>
    <li> Very good gentle hairbrush for your hair-especially if you have long hair and you do not want to harm your hair. It seems superior quality. I very much like this product. Not sure it is real boars hair. It is decent quality, however, it could be a bit better.</li>
    <li> Too soft for brushing my hair.</li>
    <li> it works&lt;br /&gt;its thin&lt;br /&gt;its small&lt;br /&gt;its strong&lt;br /&gt;and darn it it makes me look good&lt;br /&gt;ha ha ha ha</li>
    <li> if you in the wave game go ahead and buy now great product must have brush</li>
    <li> comfortable, durable, and great on thinning hair.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the comb I&#x27;d had for the past 8 years broke and I was looking for something natural. I haven&#x27;t used a brush in ages, but what this doesn&#x27;t go through my hair as I remembered. In fact, at first I thought it wasn&#x27;t working well because I felt like it wasn&#x27;t getting to all of my hair, just the top layer. So I was surprised when I glanced in the mirror after brushing it to see my hair looked so silky! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and I&#x27;m starting to get used to how it feels when brushing. And I&#x27;m shocked at how great it looks!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying the no-poo method of cleaning hair for a couple of years now and loved it. Anyone familiar with this knows that the idea is your hair oils balance out over time and you are able to leave more time between your baking soda rinses. After a while though, my hair sort of stalled and I had to wash with the baking soda once a week. But in the few weeks I&#x27;ve had this brush, I&#x27;ve noticed I can go longer. Once my hair starts to look a bit toward the oily side, I brush it for a few minutes and it suddenly looks better. I&#x27;m not sure if the boar bristles absorb the oil or redistribute it or exactly what it happening. But after a year of needing to use the baking soda rinse one per week, for the first time I have gone two weeks (rinsing daily with water in between). So if you are trying no-poo, this brush comes highly recommended from a fellow no-pooer.</li>
    <li> Half the bristles fell out as I was removing brush from the package.</li>
    <li> The very second I took this out of the shipping box it began shedding, I figured it was just a few from the manufacturing process and ran my hand along the bristles and it continued to shed with each pass.. Until I had quite the pile of bristles in front of me. Additionally the finish began to chip immediately and top top all this off, this all happened within one minute of pulling this from the box. Not worth the shipping to return it, but my money won&#x27;t have been wasted if it saves more of you the dissapointment of purchasing this thing.</li>
    <li> Bristles are too short - will use it as dog groomer.</li>
    <li> smaller than I expected</li>
    <li> did not function well, and bristles came out all over my hair when I brushed  :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what possessed me to buy a hair brush. I haven&#x27;t owned one in about 5 years, yet something was telling me to buy a hair brush for my 1/2&amp;#34; long hair. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a product I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d even use, so cut to this $4 hair brush. The bristles fall out at the slightest touch and just feels cheap. Oh well, at least it was less than $10.00 out of my pocket.</li>
    <li> I like when a seller describes the item fully and the details match what you get.  It&#x27;s a hairbrush.  Nice bristles, very smooth, and strong sturdy frame.  What&#x27;s not to like?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> way too soft. fine for my granddaughter though.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair brush I should have gone one step higher to the medium brush but it is well made and does the job.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
    <li> This only brushes the top layer of my thick hair.</li>
    <li> Men&#x27;s hair brushes with softer bristles are hard to find. These are perfect and well priced.</li>
    <li> Very good soft brush.  The only thing the bristles come out every now nthen.</li>
    <li> Gave it to my sister to use on her infant. It just didn&#x27;t cut it for my thick hair:( I wouldnt recommend it for anyone with normal hair.</li>
    <li> The product is exactly as described. The bristles are soft/medium which is how I like it. My husband uses it daily and his waves never looked better and I use it on my hair because it helps pull the hair back nice and tight. This is a perfect brush for both man or woman.</li>
    <li> I bought this for use on my long-haired dog. No, it doesn&#x27;t penetrate his hair - but I didn&#x27;t really expect it to. The bristles are very soft, which makes it perfect for brushing loose hair off his face after I trim around his eyes and mouth. And, he loves it! I think it must feel good to him because he really seems to enjoy when I use it on him, and it is a little fun between us after I have trimmed him up, which he doesn&#x27;t like. I am satisfied with my purchase and happy to have a natural bristle brush that is less likely to pull or damage his hair.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my brush.  I have to admit, my hair is starting to thin... and the soft bristles feel very very good on my hair. I always felt it was important to brush your hair often... to massage your scalp and move essential oils about. The generous size of this brush does an excellent job.  You do lose a few bristles at first... but that stops happening very quickly. Very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was packed well... and sent out quickly after I ordered it. The postal service took nine days to get it to my house. With the Amazon Prime 2 day shipping promise... that was a little disappointing.</li>
    <li> got the wrong item but was in good condition and if your hair easily breaks this is for you</li>
    <li> Brought it for a gift. ...they loved it and it arrived quickly</li>
    <li> I use this brush for my four-year-old&#x27;s super fine hair. Like the other reviewers note, this is not a brush to get out knots (even for fine hair) but it does a great job of making it shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> bristles. The brush is is nice size and weight in the hand.  The bristles are firmly attached.  This is a great deal for a boar hair brush.</li>
    <li> This brush help me make my waves look better and connect faster than the other brushes i was using. And the bristle hardly did fall out like the other brushes.I could still use this brush after 8 weeks of wolfing.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed, I use it for dry brushing my skin to prevent lose skin from weight loss. Seems to work.  First boat bristle brush I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite brushes. A great finisher for a good brush session. Every waver needs this in their arsenal</li>
    <li> The moment I pulled my new brush out of the package and felt how soft the bristles was when I knew this product would work great on my natural curly hair (4c-4b texture). I use it to spread oil from my scalp to the ends of my hair, brushing very slowly. It is incredibly gentle on my fragile hair and leaves my hair wonderfully soft. I&#x27;m going to get one for my little girl as well since it is so gentle.</li>
    <li> I needed replacements for my old natural bristle brushes and found this one.  This is a very soft brush so you need to use a little more power, which is good for stimulating the scalp.  The big thing for me is that this is a very kind brush to my fragile thinning hair.  My old brushes pulled out a lot of hair where this one doesn&#x27;t.  I love it so much I&#x27;ve ordered two additional brushes - one for travel.  I did notice that there were some individual bristles that came out during the first week, which is common to most of the brushes I&#x27;ve used, and this appears to have subsided.</li>
    <li> I would have given 5 stars but the brush did not work for me. That said, this is a great brush for the price. My hair is fine, but too thick for the bristles to penetrate to the scalp. This would be a wonderful brush for a young child or someone with thinning hair.</li>
    <li> the reason why i like this product is because it shows the compression of my waves and its right for me</li>
    <li> I used to have a perfect bristle brush, but the handle was chewed up by a puppy a long time ago.  After 20 years, my spouse grew tired of me using an unsightly chewed-up brush and bought me a new one.  But -ouch!- the bristles were stiff and painful on my scalp.  So I bought this nice soft one here. But I find this is SO soft it seems to just ride on top of my 1&amp;#34; long thinning hair, without even touching my scalp.  So I am left with Goldilock&#x27;s Dilemma:  This is TOO SOFT, my other brush is TOO HARD, but where, oh where, is the brush that is JUST RIGHT?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the quality of this brush is very high, and is perhaps useful for some applications.</li>
    <li> upon reading many other reviews, I&#x27;m writing this review to set them all (who don&#x27;t know) straight. This is NOT a standard hair brush, its NOT ment to un Knott your tangles. Its a smoothing brush, its ment to help smooth out kinks in the hair when styling it, its also been used for centres as a night brush. Woman (including my self) would use this brush at night to pull the natural conditioning oils down from the scalp to the ends of the hair, thus reducing an oily scalp, and reducing split ends, and damaged hair. This is good for your hair, and helps make your hair beautiful and shinny. The boar hair Bristles are best when they are soft, makes it easy to brush against the skin, its a wonderful brush to use on your baby&#x27;s and kids tender heads and hair. I use this brush 2 times a day, the bristles are strong and has never fallen out, the brush has been built good. I love this brush, and have told my besties about this brush.</li>
    <li> For the price, a great value. It&#x27;s a boar bristle brush, it doesn&#x27;t need to be fancy.  Some bristles fall out, especially on the first use, but it does its job.</li>
    <li> Soft lovely brush for my baby fine hair. If you have thick hair not sure if this brush will get to the root. Great for smoothing and nightly brushing x 100 just as we were taught to bring out the natural oil and shine. Nice brush for thinner hair or  for people who have gone through chemo and need a gentle product.</li>
    <li> This brush is well made and very soft and gentle.  Our son is bi racial and he has curly hair.  He hates to have his hair combed but with this brush he does not mind.  A good brush.</li>
    <li> Works well but painted black and made in China. Would look for a brush for a better handle next time.</li>
    <li> This brush is really lame, it barely did anything to help me get any waves. Just get crown brushes they are A LOT better than this bulls***</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful hair brush.  It has soft bristles, which are top quality.  Therefore, I would highly recommend the purchase of this product.  DAME HILDA VAN WINKLE.</li>
    <li> This brush is very good.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t tangle up my hair like most brushes so, and no static involved with this.</li>
    <li> I have very fine and thin hair, it has always been like that since I was a kid (so it&#x27;s not from age). I bought this to stimulate my scalp and brush the oils away and stimulate faster growth. I had to be careful with which brush I chose because I didn&#x27;t want to rip my hair out or damage it.&lt;br /&gt;It kind of freaked me out a little because the bristles wouldn&#x27;t even reach my scalp through my fine/thin hair! I had to lift segment by segment working my way to the nape to feel like I got all of my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I gave up after a few nights..but I am keeping it just because it was cheap and it seems to be made well.&lt;br /&gt;It kind of reminds me of those body circulation brushes!&lt;br /&gt;I can see how this would be AWESOME for a little girl or boy with fine thin hair that gets tangles easy, this will take the fear out of you brushing it since it doesn&#x27;t rip through the hair but merely brushes over it. You would have to use a different one to get severe tangles out for sure or do like my dad when I was little and just brush up to the knot and then continue under the knot. hee hee&lt;br /&gt;Also, my hair frizzed / got static-y a little when I used this... but no biggie.</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Exactly as described. Bought it on special request due to the non scratch natural bristles. And sure enough. It does not scratch</li>
    <li> The brush is smooth to use and it does make hair softer and shinier. The only problem I&#x27;ve encountered is the horrendous industrial smell it came with and has retained. I would avoid this if you&#x27;re sensitive to odors, but otherwise it&#x27;s really very nice for a simple tool.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work on my hair or anyone else&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I love it, works great</li>
    <li> The bristles are very soft and luxurious. I got this for my wife who loves it, and I&#x27;ve used it on my beard. For my face it was soft enough to use and made my beard look even better than normal. I want to order a second one for other places I don&#x27;t want to overlapping with my face.</li>
    <li> When it comes to personal grooming you can&#x27;t take short cuts. It&#x27;s all or nothing. And this brush is a winner and excellent performer. Would definately recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I use this soft Diane to lay down my hairs that stick up before I put on my durag. This is a great brush if you&#x27;re trying to get full 360 waves!</li>
    <li> over all it was a very nice brush. All black sleek looking, comfort grip on handle, and proper texture bristles. I had purchased this to assist with my connections and it really does help with doing so. The only con on the product will have to be that it was poorly made and the bristles tend to fall out. Over all good brush though for the price.</li>
    <li> I gave this 5 stars. I absolutely love this brush, and so do my sisters. We use it every night. Best way to use it is brush with regular brush, then use this for shiny and soft hair. I already see an improvement and this definitely beats store bought 8 dollar brushes.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get it through my hair at all. Guess my hair is to thick.</li>
    <li> I love this hair brush. It gets out tangles and keeps hair smooth and silky. It is very versatile and does not in any way damage hair.</li>
    <li> This brush didn&#x27;t work for me.  It is a very soft brush.  I think it would be best for people who have very thinning hair, or to use on scalp or if you have a sensitive scalp or head injury.  It is very soft and would be ideal for those situations.  It is not for fine hair, as it is too soft to brush through.</li>
    <li> A bit disillusioned after buying this brush (D8119) and the 8167. Was looking to buy medium brush and have purchased many of these over the years... The difference here is that I usually purchase from my local barber/beauty supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These items arrived on time and were seemingly fine until I began using the brushes. From day one, first use, bristles began falling out. I thought perhaps it was because the brush was new; but then I don&#x27;t recall this occurring in the past. After the bristles continued to fall out; I looked at the brush closer and the handle reads &#x27;diane #8119 FROMM CHINA&#x27; [sic].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the typo is an indication of quality here. I&#x27;m pretty frustrated about it too. Since this is a health and beauty product; there is likely nothing I can do but eat the cost. That&#x27;ll learn me. Its totally worth the trip to my local Sally&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let the buyer beware.</li>
    <li> A good buy for a brush that is soft but effective on one&#x27;s hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> I need a strong brush because I have long hair.  In all fairness the brush is strudy, but the bristels are so soft they don&#x27;t even go through my hair.  It&#x27;s like it slides down instead of through.</li>
    <li> I wanted a high quality brush because I grow my hair out and donate it. My hair is super thick, naturally spirally curly, and &#x27;unruly&#x27; at that. I use this brush twice a week or so after letting it air dry, when there is NO product in it. Smooth and silky, and the curls are tamed... I use it from the scalp to the ends, very gently, to help distribute those precious natural oils the scalp produces! I really thought I was going out on a limb with this brush, having curly hair and &#x27;coarse&#x27; hair at that; but it works super well, I can&#x27;t wait until my hair gets to donation length (to the point I can sit on it) and the curls relax even more, this brush will be just the thing to keep the locks shiny and distribute the natural oils from root to tip. Great price too, and 100% boar bristles, not half boar and half plastic!</li>
    <li> First off, I like this brush and will definitely keep it. I was looking for an inexpensive boar bristle brush to help distribute oils throughout my hair at night. I think this does the trick, though only time will tell. The process is more labor intensive than I had hoped though, as the bristles are SO soft that they only really brush through the very top layer of my (thin, fine) hair. I have to lift up my hair and get the under layers separately. That being said, I bought a soft brush because I was afraid of damaging my already damaged hair, and so I will sacrifice easy of use for less damage.</li>
    <li> works fine nice and soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen</li>
    <li> I was not a fan of this brush!  I am a woman with longer than shoulder length hair and thought I could use this as a smoothing brush for when I put my hair into a pony tail.  I was very wrong!  This is probably only good for really short hair!</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It is super soft and perfect for smoothing and finishing a style. Works great for kids and their tender heads!</li>
    <li> this brush is a lot darker in person and it&#x27;s really soft,&lt;br /&gt;however you could get this at a cheap Oriental store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> It states that it is soft, it that is no lie. To soft for me, but, still a nice brush for someone else.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this brush are so short that it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me.  I tried to use it a few times and then just got rid of it.</li>
    <li> This is great for what I wanted it for. No more crazy scraggly out of control beard for this guy!</li>
    <li> Was told that brushing my hair with a brush that had boar bristles would help my flyaway hair.Was disappointed, it made my hair more flyaway. It was my fault though I think, I should of got the hard bristles maybe instead of the soft. As usual Amazon got it to me quick. Love amazon</li>
    <li> Grandmother wanted a soft bristle brush for her hair. This is the perfect balance for her thinning hair - stiff enough to brush with, but soft enough to not hurt her head. She likes it.</li>
    <li> This brush is soooo nice I have pretty curly hair and it smoothed out the oils pretty well my roots are looking stronger</li>
    <li> This brush is now a dog brush. Would not go through my hair.</li>
    <li> Great value.  If you have a semi bald head, its perfect.  For the negative comments:  What did you expect for $4.00&lt;br /&gt;?</li>
    <li> great price.  nice brush</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for women&#x27;s hair at a great price! I realize that it is designed for men, but I love the way it feels on my mid-length tresses. It massages the scalp beautiful and smooths flyaways. I will definetly order more of these brushes for my children!</li>
    <li> Complete garbage.  The paint has all peeled off after a few used.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the quality of this brush, for the price that I paid! It is so soft and works well with my hair. A friend owns a salon and he said that I got an amazing deal on this!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good hair brush and found this on Amazon.  The brush bristles are a little to soft for my liking but it works fine.  I bought two and use the second to groom my Boxer.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> Very convenient. Too harsh? Turn it around?</li>
    <li> This worked great for my child&#x27;s sensitive head. I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores so I ordered it and it got here before the date.</li>
    <li> I have long hair, and this is clearly the wrong brush for me.  I try to brush and my hair gets all static-y and frizzy and just plain hilarious looking.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  The bristles are very soft and flexible for my hair, mustache and sideburns.  It is very comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> size and feel are ok. initially lots of bristles falling out. but this has seemed to stop.</li>
    <li> Great Brush...not to firm and not soft but just right.</li>
    <li> This is not a stiff-bristled brush, this is a brush for making your hair and scalp healthy and shiny.  And I love it.  It reminds me of the brushes my mom used to use back in the 60&#x27;s when she would brush my hair and my sisters about a 100 times.  Great for my scalp.  I have hair just past shoulder, and I spend time brushing it before bed as a ritual now.  We need scalp oil passed gently into the hair.  This brush does that.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush for my daughter - she HATES when I brush her hair usually. She is four years old. She says it hurts and it was driving me nuts trying to find a brush that would not hurt her. This is the one that works for us!!! HOWEVER, she has thin hair so if you have thick hair or very curly, don&#x27;t even bother. Because of the kind of bristles, it doesn&#x27;t go down deep into the hair, which is why it doesn&#x27;t hurt her either. It&#x27;s very soft. It does take longer to brush it because it doesn&#x27;t get a lot of hair at one time. But the extra time is worth it since I don&#x27;t hear screaming the entire time! She actually likes when I brush her hair now :)</li>
    <li> well not too good for my curly hair, smells bad. well i dont think its bad but its too soft for my hair</li>
    <li> Great product and the quality of these brushes are excellent. Head and shoulders better than any other brush that I have used over the years. I highly recommend using these as I will for years to come.</li>
    <li> I mean really, These boar bristles dont do anything magical. Better to rely on products and beauty routine to prevent static</li>
    <li> My son loves this brush.  Very soft bristles.  Good design.  Easy to hold.  If you sensitive skin this brush is for you.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair so even though I read the bad reviews, I thought my hair would be ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong. You can&#x27;t use this to brush hair. The bristles on this Diane Wave Brush are as soft as those on a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t use a toothbrush hair to brush hair; and you can&#x27;t use Diane Wave Brush to brush hair!</li>
    <li> Very soft. Can&#x27;t use it on my long hair, but it makes a nice bath brush.</li>
    <li> I have fine long hair and this brush just didn&#x27;t go through my hair and do anything. It was like making brushing motions with nothing happening. Gave this to Goodwill and bought a different style brush that works great. Give it 2 stars as it seems well-made.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, no damage. Well made. Finally found a brush that doesn&#x27;t bring my granddaughter, who has thick, tangled, curly hair, to tears when brushing her hair. Bristles are tightly gathered together.</li>
    <li> would not even brush my hair.  I have long, naturally wavy hair and this brush would only get maybe the top layer.  Either the bristles are too soft or there are too many of them but i can&#x27;t see how anyone would be able to use this</li>
    <li> Neither my daughter nor my husband liked this brush. It just didn&#x27;t work for our hair type I guess, and the bristles fall out very easily.</li>
    <li> Nice brush, and the bristles are soft, but they are too soft for long hair.  Might be a good brush for someone with short hair, or maybe even as brush for a short-haired pet, such as a cat, dog, or rabbit?</li>
    <li> Nice brush if you have very very fine hair....doesn&#x27;t work quite right for me, I&#x27;d try this brand again if there are more choices on the type of bristles.</li>
    <li> This brush is soft and the bristles are short . . . definitely intended as a &#x27;smoothing&#x27; brush! The black plastic handle is comfortable and easy to hold . . . 68 years old with medium length thinning hair, here! Perfect for what I need and certainly inexpensive. I may not be using the brush &#x27;as intended&#x27; but the brush accomplish exactly what I want!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a brush to use for my sensitive scalp. I have a sensitive scalp which also tends to have a decent amount of dandruff. Which is going away using Nizoral A-D Anti-Dandruff Shampoo. I wanted a brush to use that would straighten out my short hair. I also wanted to brush away any dandruff on my scalp so my scalp can breath grow healthy hair. This does the job for me. One thing though and not really a big deal to me. Is that always a few strands of the brush tend to come out when pulled. This doesn&#x27;t bother me as I dont see a need to pull on them. However if I suppose I want to clean off any of my hair strands from the brush I can see this becoming a problem over time but there&#x27;s so many strands on the brush it would take a while. I recommend this if you have fine/short hair and a sensitive scalp. If you also want to brush off any dandruff clean your scalp.</li>
    <li> Bristles are not strong. It&#x27;s like brushing your hair with a soft toothbrush...pointless.</li>
    <li> Good Price and great quality. a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p</li>
    <li> This brush is great quality.  I love to use it at night to evenly distribute the oil in my hair before bed.  This brush is not intended for detangling, but I knew that.</li>
    <li> The brush is nice and has held up well but it is much too rough to use on my toddlers hair.  It is not soft at all.  My husband likes it though.</li>
    <li> Nice soft brush that will help you when you take your doo-rag off, it is a good brush that will help you lay down loose hairs and keep your wave pattern going</li>
    <li> i need this for my daughters&#x27; edges, especially when they have cornrows that are gettng a bit frizzy near the hairline. it is soft enough to not hurt their skin and to do a great job. i even use it on their braids to smooth them out without any snagging.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a soft brush.  So many brushes today are very hard and can cause damage to your scalp.  This brush is soft and livens up your scalp as you brush.  It is perfect for anyone.  I have given it as a gift to friends and they love it too.</li>
    <li> Nice brush soft bristles but not too soft gets the job done I am very pleased with the item and its price</li>
    <li> This brush is so soft, definitely not meant for styling thick hair like mine. I will use on my puppy.</li>
    <li> A firm soft brush but I still like it</li>
    <li> Purchased for &amp;#34;chemo&amp;#34; hair. &amp;#34;Extremely&amp;#34; soft bristled - not sure what good this would be for any other purpose.</li>
    <li> Awful... Bought for my daughter. While I parted her hair I let her hold the brush, when I was ready for the brush I noticed MANY bristles all over the bed. I threw it straight into the garbage. Never even used it.</li>
    <li> some of the bristles are too long and had to be trimmed.  The carving inn the wood handle could use another sanding.</li>
    <li> I find this brush very hard to use.  It&#x27;s not very good at getting into my hair so I have to lift my hair and brush it in sections in order to use it.  I know it isn&#x27;t meant for detangling and I don&#x27;t use it as such - I use it to help distribute the oils of my scalp to keep my hair healthier - but it&#x27;s time consuming to part my hair so much to use it that I don&#x27;t use it much.</li>
    <li> Cons&lt;br /&gt;*Doesn&#x27;t penetrate scalp well&lt;br /&gt;*Not good for thick hair. You have to separate your hair into sections in order to brush effectively&lt;br /&gt;*Makes hair static&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Makes my hair softer&lt;br /&gt;*Would be great for animals! (I might buy one for my cat)</li>
    <li> Solidly made, but the bristles are too soft to part hair easily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m by far not a hairstylist or a beauty queen but this brush couldn&#x27;t even brush my hair, i have thick brown wavy hair, maybe its only supposed to be used to polish or finish hair???</li>
    <li> Worked well at first.&lt;br /&gt;But even being gentle with it, bristles got kind of mashed down.&lt;br /&gt;Had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> The write up about this brush says soft bristles on one side and firm bristles on the other.  Not so.  Is all soft bristles so doesn&#x27;t work if you need something firmer.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine hair that&#x27;s prone to oiliness at the scalp, but the rest of my hair will dry out if I wash it every day. I bought this brush to help distribute the oil throughout my hair on days when I don&#x27;t wash it. It works perfectly for this. I just separate my hair into multiple small sections, brush each section a few times, and I&#x27;m done. There has been a noticeable difference in the health of my hair. Areas where my hair was brittle and damaged have started to repair, and overall my hair is much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price of the brush, it&#x27;s excellent quality. Some bristles fell out for about the first week of using it, but now the brush has stopped shedding. The handle and back of the brush are solid and smooth, and very comfortable for me to grip.</li>
    <li> This brush has a great size and bristle texture (medium). Provides me with great coverage and a nice result brushing down my waves.</li>
    <li> Perfect, just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I had heard of the many virtues of boar bristle brushes and have used similar ones in the past, so I thought this would be a great purchase. Unfortunately, the bristles are far too soft - like silk strands, really. They just glide over my hair; they don&#x27;t get between the strands to actually brush them out.</li>
    <li> So I wanted a boar bristle brush that would effectively comb my medium length hair and provide some shine benefits. I find that this brush is a little too gentle on my hair and instead of combing through my hair it just flattens it when I pass it through. The bristles are also packed together too tightly and I find it hard to separate the strands of my hair with it. I usually just use it to smooth my hair out when I do a ponytail or bun. It&#x27;s also great for getting the oils to your ends. I would have liked it better if it wasn&#x27;t so soft.  The bristles bend too much and doesn&#x27;t hold on to my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  I used to have occasional dandruff that would show when I wore dark clothing. I wasn&#x27;t sure what was causing it and vaguely remember a dermatologist from way back when saying that it was a fungal thing rather than just plain ole dry skin.  Regardless, I thought it was something I would just have to manage when it showed up, but not any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realized that one thing I wasn&#x27;t doing was brushing my hair enough, I would just dry it after showers and be done with it.  Even when i would brush it, it wasn&#x27;t with a bristle brush.  Now I brush my hair with this brush after every time I shower and have absolutely no flakes.  Another thing was that when I used to sweat, my scalp would become itchy all over.  This no longer happens and it&#x27;s a great feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is a great tool that&#x27;s easy for me to help maintain a head of hair I&#x27;m proud of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Sidenote: I guess the way the brush is angled in the picture, it looks grayish, but it&#x27;s actually glossy black)</li>
    <li> I know I ordered it in february and it is now may... This was the first Diane brush I have ever had... But doing my research later... This isn&#x27;t the original one or the same as the photo you have for it... The brush is smaller and the word Diane is in the wrong area of the brush... I purchashed a different number Diane and compared the two... they are totally different... Even comparing the one sent to your photo here it ain&#x27;t the same... I&#x27;m dissapointed about that... Good price wrong/copy brush...</li>
    <li> This brush can&#x27;t comb through your hair. If you want a brush for getting out tangles or getting from scalp to ends, this is not a good brush for you. This is a brush for the final stages of styling. It makes your hair sleek and shiny and helps smooth down flyaways. It&#x27;s very good for distributing oil or product throughout the top layer of hair.</li>
    <li> This wouldn&#x27;t brush anything. It&#x27;s so soft it won&#x27;t even brush soft bangs. Worthless to us. I can&#x27;t see how it got good reviews unless you were brushing a bald head!</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing for the price, however I wish it was a bit wider.  I use baking soda and apple cider vinegar to wash my hair, and if you are going to go &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34;, this is a great starter Boar-Bristle brush.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like brushes that are hard or acts like a comb. This one is soft and gentle. I use it on myself and the kids</li>
    <li> I dont know why but it just has a fabiously feel to it, a nice sturdy wood. The brush is definetly soft and I bought it for one reason only, to brush my hair after I put it in a pony tail so I dont get those streaky marks, and it does exactly that! This brush isnt much for lets say detangling your hair at all, at least my thick hair, and after reading a review I have also gotten intot eh habit of first combing through my hair with a detangle brush THEN brushing through with this one, from the root all the way to the tip, every night. Ive noticed a lot of shine to my ends now! It has that classic look to it, its just a nice looking brush too. The 1 down fall and nuisance is it creates static for sure, and thats pretty annoying seeing your hair look like a mad scientist.</li>
    <li> Softer than I expected.</li>
    <li> 100% what? Soft? Not 100% boar. I tested the suspicious looking bristles and they melted and infused the air with the wonderful aroma of burning plastic.  Whoever runs this store needs to change the description or title of this product. They are lying and I&#x27;m sure by now (benefit of the doubt) they know it.</li>
    <li> This takes me back to my childhood when people would want to brush your hair&lt;br /&gt;because it ends up like a bunch of silk in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;It does not break your hair but invigorates your scalp somehow.&lt;br /&gt;I brush my hair in all directions as it is thick, and it looks incredible.</li>
    <li> The brush seems to be a good quality product, however, it didn&#x27;t work well for me. I have long hair that is a bit thicker than the average. The bristles were so soft and tightly packed that it just seemed to skim over the top of my hair. I couldn&#x27;t get it to grab and sink into my hair to effectively brush it without a lot of effort. I even tried using another comb just to try to keep this brush against my hair while brushing. I recommend a brush with stiffer bristles and maybe more space between the bristles if you have long and/or thick hair.</li>
    <li> My mother in law has very little hair and other brushes (especially plastic ones) were painful for her to use. Other boar bristle brushes were too hard on her scalp. This one is soft and leaves her hair looking cared for. We would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> too soft to even penetrate my hair and I don&#x27;t have thick hair</li>
    <li> Love the Diane Wave Brush, that is soft.  My husband has baby fine hair and its excellent for him...</li>
    <li> when they said Soft bristles they weren&#x27;t lying lol.  they are super soft and flexible, and don&#x27;t really get down between the hair as much as it glides over the top.  It feels really good, and my cats are crazy over it. but it&#x27;s a little too soft for me i believe.  definitely not like the one i had growing up. but i still like it for things.</li>
    <li> Bristles come out... like 20 at a time. The first 2 times brushing, my shirt was covered in bristles.</li>
    <li> Great brush! I usually use a regular hairbrush after taking a shower and then use this brush when my hair is try. It really seems to soften my hair and make it look more natural! I love it!</li>
    <li> I needed a new hair brush because my old one was nearly 20 years old and the bristles began to fall out.  I bought this one and share the following observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The bristles began falling out before it arrived - yes, there were loose bristles in the package.  The process continues without letup.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The brush is confortable to hold and use.  It is a little larger than most hair brushes, and I like it.  This saved the product from receiving the minimum 1 star from me.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The black paint is OK, but already is chipping.  Should be left natural wood color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended for anyone.</li>
    <li> This brush isn&#x27;t rounded at all, and the photo doesn&#x27;t really show that. I guess I&#x27;ll use it on my cat instead of on myself.</li>
    <li> Lol dont buy it i think its not for humain hair , 000000</li>
    <li> I bought it for my 27 month old. she has fine hair and not much of it :)&lt;br /&gt;This brush is soft and light, easy to hold. she likes it and it brushes her hair well.&lt;br /&gt;my dad, 61 yrs old, wants one and I am about to order another one.&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> This is my go to hair brush. It is very soft which means that it won&#x27;t tug or pull hard on your hair. It is a great brush for thin hair and delicate or sensitive scalp. I still have it. I simply sanitize it and clean it up and put it in boiling water to make sure it is thoroughly clean. It is a great brush.  I totally recommend it.  I hope you found my review helpful.</li>
    <li> I would think of this item more as a tool to make your hair smooth and shiny and less as a &amp;#34;brush.&amp;#34; As other reviews have stated, the brush does not penetrate your hair, it simply glides over the surface. I like that it smooths the hair near my part that tends to stick up.</li>
    <li> Very very good quality and the bristles are really real.  If anything can get a wave in my straight hair, this will.  It is great for distributing the hair&#x27;s natural oils and therefore making the hair glow healthier and give it a great cared-for sheen.  I like it a great deal.</li>
