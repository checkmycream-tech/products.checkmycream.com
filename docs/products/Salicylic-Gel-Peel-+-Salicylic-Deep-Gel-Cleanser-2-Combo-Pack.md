      <li>THIS CLEANSER IS AWESOME.</li>
      <li>My skin looks flawless!</li>
      <li>thing I do recommend is getting a VERY good moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the Perfect Image</li>
      <li>These products have done a great job clearing up acne blemishes and smoothing out my skin.  </li>
      <li>These products are a great combination.  </li>
      <li>I use many Perfect Image products &amp; this is a great addition to my beauty regimen.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t going to splurge for the perfect image cream and just continue using the brand I have, but I may change my mind as I&#x27;m sure the peel will leave my skin dryer than the cleanser</li>
      <li>i just turned 29 and my skin does not look as bright as it used to.</li>
      <li>Loved this product, it works well and the gel formula does not drip/run.  </li>
      <li>Also, this stuff will ruin a good gel manicure so it also helps avoid getting this stuff on your hands or nails.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, this works great and keeps that &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t wear good clothes or have anything that you don&#x27;t want ruined around just in case you drip some of this stuff...</li>

      <li>The cleanser does a great job of keeping my clean as well as prepping for the peel.</li>
      <li>Everything we go through to be beautiful has a level of pain (even plucking your eyebrows), but it&#x27;s up to you to determine what level you&#x27;re willing to take it to.  </li>
      <li>and although I need more help than that but refuse to go to someone else</li>

      <li>I personally love the Salicylic Gel alot.</li>
      <li>It does a much better job than those multi step (cleanser, toner, lotions, etc).</li>
      <li>I will say that I didn&#x27;t use the gel cleanser more than once</li>
      <li>I use this product 2x per week, but never leave it on more than 30 to 45 seconds.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many peelings for my acne prone skin</li>
      <li>I give myself a chemical peel and also follow it with the same perfect image wrinkle</li>
      <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do--can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
      <li>More than satisfied.  </li>
      <li>I am totally amazed at the wonderful changes in my skin.  </li>
      <li>OK, let me start out with the fact that i am a 44 yo</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I don&#x27;t want to put foundation all the time.</li>
      <li>I Love it&lt;</li>
      <li>love this product and the price is not bad , my skin is very fresh and clean and im 40 i take good care of my skin just do not over do it .</li>
      <li>directions are easy.  </li>
      <li>I received my cleanser and peel combo pack very quickly.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>I will do another pass and possibly write another review in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the amazing product! :)</li>
      <li>Shipping was quick as well!</li>
      <li>It also has kept me from getting any blemishes which is a huge plus.</li>
      <li>i recently purchased the peel and cleanser combo pack and have to say that the combination of the cleanser and peel have done a great job of keeping my skin refreshed.</li>
      <li>The peel is fabulous.  </li>
      <li>I get all I need between seeing my facialist, with fantastic results at a bargain</li>
      <li>One thing I was very happy about was the shipping price; even though this product didn&#x27;t qualify for the free super saver shipping it costed less than $2 which is wonderful.&lt;br</li>
      <li>the first treatment I could able to see results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>most important thing is I can see it&#x27;s working on my post acne marks which were really visible on my face.&lt;br /&gt;after</li>
      <li>I like it the face wash, makes  my face feel clean and refresh.</li>
      <li>It helped clean up the dermatitis on my nose without over drying my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Adding the gel peel keeps  our skin looking fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using the Perfect Image products I have gotten many compliments on how good my skin looks  As a 54 year old, I never get tired of hearing it!</li>
      <li>Easy right.  </li>
      <li>It does a very good job of removing dead skin on my forehead, nose and chin.</li>
      <li>my face wash it off with cool water,</li>
      <li>havent used this produc tlong enoug to see full results yet</li>
      <li>I am thanking my lucky stars I found this product.  </li>
      <li>Also I keep baking soda and water nearby for quick neutralization if I need it.</li>
      <li>The cleanser has a cool refreshing tingle that leaves your skin feeling squeaky clean but not tight.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very happy so far and very optimistic for the peel later on this week.</li>
      <li>I have purchased many perfect image products over the last few years and have always been pleased to get professional results at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
      <li>so there are not to many face products I feel are strong enough for my skin.</li>
      <li>left.the peel wasnt as exciting</li>
      <li>I did it right</li>
      <li>I would very much advice</li>
      <li>I cannot begin to explain how pleased I am with the Salicylic Gel Peel and Deep Gel Cleanser.</li>
      <li>and I can definitely say that it worked better than the one I paid $90 for at the salon.</li>
      <li>This was my first at home chemical peel</li>
      <li>This is my first purchasing a salicylic peel product for use at home.  </li>
      <li>Although it does burn slightly, fanning it works great and the cool water neutralizes the sting almost instantly.</li>
      <li>Its clear, smooth, has a more even tone, and the black heads on my nose are disappearing for the first time ever!  </li>
      <li>i love how easy the gel is to use compared to the liquid products i have tried in the past.</li>
      <li>Lol, this is one of those products that definitely makes it worse before it makes it better.</li>
      <li>Skin on my face feels kind of tight after, but it will take few days,most important have a good moisturize and sunscreen if u going outside.</li>
      <li>Might be too strong for regular use but did what I wanted it too which was get rid of that surface bacteria.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t do whole face in summer.</li>
      <li>Really controls the oil.</li>
      <li>and I really like the cleanser.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have any peeling and my face was only red and warm feeling for about 30 minutes or so after the treatment.</li>
      <li>I purchased these items and after several months of use have seen significant improvements in my skin.  </li>
      <li>Definitely better than other products I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>The peel keeps my skin clear and bright and is not too harsh even though I&#x27;m 66 years old with the corresponding thinning skin.  </li>
      <li>I have spent so much money trying to keep my skin clear, heal/lighten acne scars, and start an age appropriate anti aging routine.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I totally love the cleanser and use it every other day in conjunction with cetaphil in between!  </li>
      <li>I also haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts!</li>
      <li>I had used the peel previously and bought the combo to see if the cleanser could make it even better.  </li>
      <li>As I got older I realized the value in these things.  </li>
      <li>I am now only able to get back &amp;#34;home&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>and it has really help fade some marks, and as completely cleared all my stubborn blackheads!</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend doing a patch test to see how your skin reacts as well as follow the directions exactly!</li>
      <li>After a few weeks my face was sooooo much better.</li>
      <li>if you have very sensitive skin like me, this product is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>I have so far used it two times, two weeks apart</li>
      <li>My skin feels so soft afterwards.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this product!  The peel keeps my skin clear and bright and is not too harsh even though I&#x27;m 66 years old with the corresponding thinning skin.  I use the peel about once a week in conjunction with daily use of the cleanser.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and it burned my face and now i have burn marks where i applied it. It only to seconds for it to do damage to my face. I would very much advice if you have very sensitive skin like me, this product is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> love this product and the price is not bad , my skin is very fresh and clean and im 40 i take good care of my skin just do not over do it .</li>
    <li> I purchased these items and after several months of use have seen significant improvements in my skin.  The items arrived as promised and on time.  I will definitely repurchase without hesitation.</li>
    <li> I personally love the Salicylic Gel alot. It does a very good job of removing dead skin on my forehead, nose and chin. I have normal-dry-slightly sensitive skin so i only let it on my face for 30-50 sec. If you have sensitive skin please avoid the cheek and nostril areas. The face wash is a little too drying for me though, i would recommended something less consistent if you have dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many perfect image products over the last few years and have always been pleased to get professional results at a fraction of the cost.  Just remember if you are new to gel peels, start off with a very brief period of time ( &amp;#60; 1 min ) and work your way up as your skin becomes accustomed to the products ingredients.</li>
    <li> OK, let me start out with the fact that i am a 44 yo and i&#x27;ve been getting regular facials since I can remember.  In recent years I have started to get peels (ie hibiscus peels, obagi blue peels and a variety of acid peels).  As I got older I realized the value in these things.  Most were painful and had a dramatic &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; period after that took up to 7 days.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it was usually worth it as peeling back dead layers of skin always look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I moved away from my long trust facialist she recommended this product.  I am now only able to get back &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; once a quarter and although I need more help than that but refuse to go to someone else (i&#x27;m a creature of habit).  If you are like me you are skeptical about any product like this, but her recommendation was taken very seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let me say that you need to buy a fan brush in conjunction with this purchuse in order to get an even application.  Also, this stuff will ruin a good gel manicure so it also helps avoid getting this stuff on your hands or nails.  If you don&#x27;t like pain then resign to being ugly for the rest of your life.  Everything we go through to be beautiful has a level of pain (even plucking your eyebrows), but it&#x27;s up to you to determine what level you&#x27;re willing to take it to.  Don&#x27;t wear good clothes or have anything that you don&#x27;t want ruined around just in case you drip some of this stuff...remember,it&#x27;s acid!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions are easy.  Put it on with the brush, wait a few minutes and use warm to cold water to get it off.  Easy right.  I use this product 2x per week, but never leave it on more than 30 to 45 seconds.  This is a personal preference as I just want to stimulate the skin to shed not burn things off.  Honestly, this works great and keeps that &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; look at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 75 per facial I am thanking my lucky stars I found this product.  I get all I need between seeing my facialist, with fantastic results at a bargain price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who doesn&#x27;t like that??</li>
    <li> I am 30 years old.  I have never had acne until I hit my late 20&#x27;s.  I have tried everything; multiple prescriptions, proactive, acne free, various facial scrubs and cleansers, over night treatments, AHA....  I could go on forever.  I have spent so much money trying to keep my skin clear, heal/lighten acne scars, and start an age appropriate anti aging routine.&lt;br /&gt;About me;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is not overly dry or oily.  I am Caucasian, dark hair, medium skin tone, my problem area is my chin and around my mouth but, I have always had tiny blackheads on my nose (not very visible and I thought I was stuck with them)&lt;br /&gt;This product is WONDERFUL!  I use the deep gel cleanser multiple times a week (not just as a chemical peel prep).  I also use the hydrating repair peptide wrinkle cream post using the salicylic deep gel cleanser.  2-4 times a month I give myself a chemical peel and also follow it with the same perfect image wrinkle cream.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is beautiful!  Its clear, smooth, has a more even tone, and the black heads on my nose are disappearing for the first time ever!  I love this product and think anyone considering it should give it a shot!</li>
    <li> These products are a great combination.  The prewash does its jobs by preparing the skin for the treatment.  The peel is fabulous.  It does sting, but that is expected.  My skin feels so soft afterwards.  I can see some improvements and its only been a month.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product once a werk for Six weeks Just once a yr..... I Love it&lt;br /&gt;It is lughtening the spots. I leave it on for 2 min and I fan my face wash it off with cool water, omg&lt;br /&gt;Every one has complimented my skin&lt;br /&gt;I def recommend this once a week for ONLY 6 weeks&lt;br /&gt;Love results</li>
    <li> my sister told me to try a salicylic peel so i just decided to get the combo.I loved and still love this cleanser.you can feel the indredients on your face tighten and cleanse your skin.and this was a week of washing before the peel.still have plenty cleanser left.the peel wasnt as exciting but it did dry up visiable acne bumps overnight.slight peeling next morning but nothing major.still using cleasnser and i think that is the key both of them together.please read the instructions folks .i will use this product again</li>
    <li> I have tan skin and when I get breakouts they leave terrible hyper pigmentation scars! :| I was contemplating getting a peel and since I have acne prone skin I chose this one. I have so far used it two times, two weeks apart and it has really help fade some marks, and as completely cleared all my stubborn blackheads! I totally love the cleanser and use it every other day in conjunction with cetaphil in between!  My skin does peel while using this treatment but nothing too extreme. I also haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts! Do not forget to pile on the sunscreen and some good quality moisturiser :)</li>
    <li> perfect condition and packaging. havent used this produc tlong enoug to see full results yet but i can say day one of using the cleanser showed an improvement.</li>
    <li> I use many Perfect Image products &amp; this is a great addition to my beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> It does what it says - peels. You just have to be careful how long you keep it on your face.My skin is rough so I had no problem with it. I put it 3-4 days every 6-8 weeks and it clears my face nice.</li>
    <li> Being a big do it yourself person, I decided to try skin peels. I have not used this, but once as I am doing alot of other things as well and dont want to kill my skin. This is nice because it comes with a good prep cleanser than gets the peeling process going and then is finished off with the salicylic acid. I recommend gel form or buffered form. I think it hurts less and gel is easier to handle. Just read the instructions and be cautious. Also I keep baking soda and water nearby for quick neutralization if I need it.</li>
    <li> I received my cleanser and peel combo pack very quickly. One thing I was very happy about was the shipping price; even though this product didn&#x27;t qualify for the free super saver shipping it costed less than $2 which is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the cleanser once a day for three days now in preparation for the peel. I am already noticing a difference in my skin tone. My acne is drying up slowly, but I haven&#x27;t had any new pimples since starting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do recommend is getting a VERY good moisturizer. I wasn&#x27;t going to splurge for the perfect image cream and just continue using the brand I have, but I may change my mind as I&#x27;m sure the peel will leave my skin dryer than the cleanser has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy so far and very optimistic for the peel later on this week. Will update this review afterwards.</li>
    <li> I use the cleanser 1-2 times a week and do the peel just before my &amp;#34;monthly visitor&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t have those silly monthly breakouts anymore! I will keep using this as long as they sell it!!</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do--can&#x27;t ask for more than that. Definitely better than other products I&#x27;ve tried and I really like the cleanser.</li>
    <li> I have had acne since a very young age and have tried all kinda of over the counter and medical remedies, including creams, lotions, antibiotics, a combination of all of these. I even tried the most severe option of doing a single 6 month accutane regimen (scary and dangerous). All of these only products only temporarily cleared my skin. I have only used this product once so far, but I could immediately feel that my skin was more tight with less redness than before. I didn&#x27;t have any peeling and my face was only red and warm feeling for about 30 minutes or so after the treatment. I would definitely recommend doing a patch test to see how your skin reacts as well as follow the directions exactly! I left the product on for about two and a half minutes on my first pass. Although it does burn slightly, fanning it works great and the cool water neutralizes the sting almost instantly. This was my first at home chemical peel and I can definitely say that it worked better than the one I paid $90 for at the salon. I will do another pass and possibly write another review in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the amazing product! :)</li>
    <li> I have tried many peelings for my acne prone skin but this one does wonders.&lt;br /&gt;from the first treatment I could able to see results.&lt;br /&gt;the most important thing is I can see it&#x27;s working on my post acne marks which were really visible on my face.&lt;br /&gt;after three treatments those marks have become less visible and I&#x27;m glad that I don&#x27;t want to put foundation all the time.</li>
    <li> This is my first purchasing a salicylic peel product for use at home.  Loved this product, it works well and the gel formula does not drip/run.  Shipping was quick as well!</li>
    <li> i recently purchased the peel and cleanser combo pack and have to say that the combination of the cleanser and peel have done a great job of keeping my skin refreshed.I use the cleanser twice a week and do a peel every 3 weeks. i love how easy the gel is to use compared to the liquid products i have tried in the past. The cleanser does a great job of keeping my clean as well as prepping for the peel.I highly recommend the combo as they do compliment each other.</li>
    <li> I feel like it&#x27;s kind of working but not really?&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really get down into the blackheads, on my nose, and I haven&#x27;t noticed it making my pores smaller. I&#x27;ve also had this for a few months now and the gel stuff also has white crystal stuck to the bottom of the container- is that bad?</li>
    <li> After going off bc pill at 36 my face was horrible. Dr wanted me to try antibiotics. I tried this instead. After a few weeks my face was sooooo much better. I was no longer embarrassed. I even go out without makeup now. I&#x27;m 37 and still get a few pimples but use this as a spot treatment.  Just don&#x27;t forget sunblock. I don&#x27;t do whole face in summer. Really controls the oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with the Perfect Image Salicylic Deep Gel Cleanser and Salicylic 20% Gel Peel.  These products have done a great job clearing up acne blemishes and smoothing out my skin.  I use the cleanser twice per week and the peel once or twice per month.  I&#x27;ve been leaving the peel on for 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, and I have tried just about every acne and skin product there is. i just turned 29 and my skin does not look as bright as it used to. I am a male so there are not to many face products I feel are strong enough for my skin. Then I accidently found this, I bet it took ten years of damage off my skin that was from using tanning beds and acne scarring in High school. It also has kept me from getting any blemishes which is a huge plus. I quit using all my acne products and benzo&#x27;s and just use this face wash every other day.</li>
    <li> this is an amazing product line. My skin looks flawless!</li>
    <li> I tried only once on my delicate skin, could hold it only for about 3minutes for the first time, it burns, no kidding, but the next day can see a little light up on my pigments.Skin on my face feels kind of tight after, but it will take few days,most important have a good moisturize and sunscreen if u going outside.I like it the face wash, makes  my face feel clean and refresh.I&#x27;lll continue to use this product for now :)</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product and have been using the cleanser for a little over 2 weeks and have applied 2 peels. I am totally amazed at the wonderful changes in my skin.  I&#x27;ve had acne for 30 years and the cleanser and peel have already cleared my skin and the dark spots have lightened considerably.  I cannot begin to explain how pleased I am with the Salicylic Gel Peel and Deep Gel Cleanser. I can&#x27;t wait to do another peel.</li>
    <li> More than satisfied.  Does what it says.  Have already recommended this peel to friends.  Will definitley be purchasing again. Gel stays where you put it.  Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I really like the tea tree oil and green tea extract in the salicylic peel.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to sting as much as other salicylic peels I have tried.  The cleanser has a cool refreshing tingle that leaves your skin feeling squeaky clean but not tight.  These are quality products.</li>
    <li> I had used the peel previously and bought the combo to see if the cleanser could make it even better.  THIS CLEANSER IS AWESOME. I&#x27;ve used it on my skin and it looks amazing after using just the cleanser.  It helped clean up the dermatitis on my nose without over drying my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought some for my acne prone daughter and it cleaned up her blackheads and breakout.  She is hooked on the cleanser.  It does a much better job than those multi step (cleanser, toner, lotions, etc). Adding the gel peel keeps  our skin looking fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using the Perfect Image products I have gotten many compliments on how good my skin looks  As a 54 year old, I never get tired of hearing it!</li>
    <li> It works. I had a strange fungus growing on my face after moving to an island, this burned it away. When I use on entire face I break out, but made my nose smooth from all those little pores. Might be too strong for regular use but did what I wanted it too which was get rid of that surface bacteria.</li>
    <li> SO I had dark knees from playing sports in high school, I also had like acne scars on my face and chest. When I started using this stuff it made my scars darker &#x3D;/. Then it made my scars look really dark and kind of like crinkley &#x3D;(. Then, my skin started to peel and.... The scars were lighter! Lol, this is one of those products that definitely makes it worse before it makes it better. The darkness on my knees is almost the same color of the rest of my leg and some of the acne scars are completely gone. One thing I will say is don&#x27;t over do it. I left it on too long and used it too often and ended up getting like a chemical burn; however, once it healed I did it right and the chemical burn scar went away too. I will say that I didn&#x27;t use the gel cleanser more than once so if you do buy this, buy the one without the gel cleanser, it was pointless.</li>
