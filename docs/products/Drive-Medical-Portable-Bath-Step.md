      <li>and they work great because they make me feel safe as I get into tub.</li>
      <li>This is a great song and I am glad that Alan is getting into bluegrass.</li>
      <li>I just wish they were more attractive.</li>
      <li>Have not done this but in looking at the design/construction of the step, it looks sturdy and very safe.  </li>
      <li>My elderly mother-in-law liked using this getting in and out of our claw foot bathtub.</li>

      <li>so I feel safe using them.</li>

      <li>Bought 2 of these and love them.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps we are more abusive than others?</li>
      <li>Great product very well made slip resistant made with seniors in mind.</li>

      <li>and you can add too this and have more steps.</li>
      <li>I have no strength in my left leg and have blood clots on both knees from an car injury 2 yrs ago, that is not healing,But this step is AWESOME!!!</li>

      <li>Since they are not bulky they are easy to store when not in use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sturdy, lightweight and easily rinsed off in mud season.  </li>
      <li>These break too easily.</li>
      <li>It has no moving parts and works just fine.</li>
      <li>but it works just fine.  </li>
      <li>You will need to buy more if you want a higher step, or one step on each side of the bath tub.  </li>
      <li>This is a good product, but I had to return it because it was too big to fit where it was needed.</li>
      <li>Good solid product.</li>
      <li>This really helps &amp; am so glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>It would have been better if all sides were straight.  </li>
      <li>Thank you very much!</li>
      <li>Safe for bath use, great for older or disabled</li>
      <li>It works really well and is easy to lift up on its side out of the way when I&#x27;m making the bed.</li>
      <li>Nice wide step that makes you feel secure.</li>
      <li>, I bought 2-more and stacked one more high and one alone and now just have to step up 2 inches, then 6 inches and seems like I am walking straight into tub..</li>
      <li>(I push them to the right side of the step).  </li>
      <li>JUST RIGHT.  </li>
      <li>She just used it for the first time today and loved it - having that extra 4\\&quot; boost before having to hoist her weak leg over the tub rim was great.</li>
      <li>I need a little extra height boost getting into my SUV and this has been perfect.  </li>
      <li>Just the right height to reach the above items and more.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise I like it very much</li>
      <li>I may order the 2&amp;#34; one to make it higher if needed.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So, buying another one! ;-)</li>
      <li>I bought this step to help me to get to level of my premiere tub, When I first got my tub</li>
      <li>Very sturdy &amp; non-slip!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t even get to the first step of a step stool without using some elevation (book).  </li>
      <li>Too big for my space but fine product for the need it is designed for</li>
      <li>I really like these</li>
      <li>These have been very helpful for my disability.</li>
      <li>It has really helped me to do these things.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It can be stored upright when not used and does not take up much space.  </li>
      <li>It assists me so much to climb into a high tub.  </li>
      <li>Exactly the right height not too tall or short just what she needed to get in and out of the tub easier.</li>
      <li>This is an adequate bath step and I especially like the way they stack.</li>
      <li>I use it for my Mom - her shower chair is too high for her</li>
      <li>I have a high desk that requires my chair at max height.</li>
      <li>The stop is strong and stable and makes getting into a high sided tub much easier for my little wife.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light enough to walk over to the gym so overall it works for what I&#x27;m using it for.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also pretty convenient to keep in place next to the tub -</li>
      <li>I can then get from the floor to the first step, then step on the book to get to the next step, etc.  </li>
      <li>Now I use this to get to the first step of a 3-step stool and use smaller books on the remaining 2 steps</li>
      <li>I had one on the outside of the tub and the other inside so the step up height was reduced and easily allowed me to access the shower.</li>
      <li>This is essential for someone who has difficulty lifting their leg high enough to reach the first step on a vehicle.</li>
      <li>Got this for my 91 year old mother for getting in the shower.  </li>
      <li>only quibble I have with this product is the photo the vendor chose to use - it&#x27;s very misleading.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a short gal with mobility issues and steps are a particular problem.  </li>
      <li>it leans straight up against it with no danger of it tipping over as long as it&#x27;s undisturbed.</li>
      <li>Initially, I feared it would take up too much space, but it fits between the toilet and tub without problem.</li>
      <li>It is small enough to carry around (in a bag), and light weight.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product and service!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my 91 year old mother for getting in the shower.  Even though her shower if for elderly, this still come in handy ..every little bit helps</li>
    <li> So easy to get into the tub for my shower now with this step.  I have sciatica and wasn&#x27;t able to step in and out very easily.  Thank goodness for aids like these.</li>
    <li> My mother recently (within the last 3 weeks) had hip replacement surgery and came home a few days ago. Her hospital OT showed her how to get in and out of the bathtub using a U-bar, but I was concerned about the height of the tub rim, so I bought this bath step. She just used it for the first time today and loved it - having that extra 4\\&quot; boost before having to hoist her weak leg over the tub rim was great. It&#x27;s also pretty convenient to keep in place next to the tub - I just wipe it dry and then stand it up on its rim against the tub. The platform is weighted, so when it&#x27;s upright against the tub it leans straight up against it with no danger of it tipping over as long as it&#x27;s undisturbed. (Of course, the cat might knock it over or someone might kick it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only quibble I have with this product is the photo the vendor chose to use - it&#x27;s very misleading. Before I purchased it, I knew that it was only a single step, not the double step that they have pictured, but only because I read the product description carefully. If they sell a single step, the accompanying picture should show a single step, with additional pictures of how steps can be added on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product, but, as always, CAVEAT EMPTOR!</li>
    <li> This small step has made getting into a garden tub easier for my elderly mother.  The step feels secure and the top is non-slip.&lt;br /&gt;It can be stored upright when not used and does not take up much space.  My mother loves it.</li>
    <li> I got this step to put by the tub to step out on. Got a shower put in.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use so I donated to Animal Thrift shop. I always donate to&lt;br /&gt;them, it helps the animals.</li>
    <li> I use the portable step on the side of my bed as I have a high mattress which made getting in bed difficult before the step.  It works really well and is easy to lift up on its side out of the way when I&#x27;m making the bed.</li>
    <li> This really helps &amp; am so glad I bought it. Very sturdy &amp; non-slip!</li>
    <li> It would have been better if all sides were straight.  Otherwise I like it very much</li>
    <li> the bath step.  I have one for the bath but I needed something to step onto the treadmill.  I wish it were smaller but it works just fine.  It&#x27;s light enough to walk over to the gym so overall it works for what I&#x27;m using it for.  Both the ones I have stay in place so I feel safe using them.</li>
    <li> my son can now pee on his own - he was just a little too short before to get himself up and over the toilet but this step is the perfect height.  other stills were all too tall and pee would end up everywhere!</li>
    <li> I am handicapped and needed something to allow me to reach cabinets, step into the tub and in other ways. It has really helped me to do these things. Nice wide step that makes you feel secure.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to help in climbing in and out of bed after having a bad back and a new, high mattress. The step works well enough, but I didn&#x27;t need them for the shower.</li>
    <li> Did not appear to be very sturdy at all, but I wouldn&#x27;t know, because when I received it, it was broken in several places. Big pieces broken off! I returned it for refund... not taking any chances!</li>
    <li> Safe for bath use, great for older or disabled</li>
    <li> This step is sturdy and arrived in a timely manner. It is great for my needs. I may order the 2&amp;#34; one to make it higher if needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not using it as a bath step. I have a high desk that requires my chair at max height. I use this as a foot rest. It has no moving parts and works just fine. Recommended.</li>
    <li> My elderly mother-in-law liked using this getting in and out of our claw foot bathtub.</li>
    <li> I recently had total hip replacement surgery and was told the bathtub-shower in my home was a little high to step into with the limitations of my surgery. I bought two of these steps and voila!! perfect! I had one on the outside of the tub and the other inside so the step up height was reduced and easily allowed me to access the shower. These are sturdy and slip-proof so they can be used for a multitude of other needs, down the line.</li>
    <li> Needed a light portable water proof step to help me vet in &amp; out of my very small shower stall since I have become severely disabled. These have proven to be perfect &amp; flexible enough to allow me to continue to shower in my home.</li>
    <li> It assists me so much to climb into a high tub.  I wish I knew about this product long before this.  It is great.</li>
    <li> I need a little extra height boost getting into my SUV and this has been perfect.  It&#x27;s sturdy, lightweight and easily rinsed off in mud season.  I drilled a hole and ran a piece of rope so I could pull it in after me.  Works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...except today when I was just going to be backing up the car, so I left the step lying on the ground. All would have been well if I hadn&#x27;t accidentally closed the door on the rope and then driven over the step and totally crunched it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, buying another one! ;-)</li>
    <li> This is a great song and I am glad that Alan is getting into bluegrass. The melody stays with you.</li>
    <li> If you need help with getting up into the bath tub this may be what you need. It did help me get over into the tub better and you can add too this and have more steps.</li>
    <li> Too big for my space but fine product for the need it is designed for</li>
    <li> These break too easily. They work, but would be better if they were made from a plastic that isn&#x27;t so brittle.</li>
    <li> the photo of the product makes the viewer believe two of these as steps will create two steps. not so. i ordered two expecting a step effect, but, just two one-step items that do not work together to create what is in the advert image.</li>
    <li> I use it for my Mom - her shower chair is too high for her - so we place the step under her feet and my husband picks her up and I can than position her on the chair.  Also Amazon offered this at a less expensive price.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my dad to get into and out of the tub to take a shower. He uses them every time and said they are a great help. I like how when you buy several they connect together so they will not come apart. Since they are not bulky they are easy to store when not in use.I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> You did an outstanding job!! I am very happy!!! Thank you very much! Now my husband can get out of the shower eay and&lt;br /&gt;without worry!</li>
    <li> Exactly the right height not too tall or short just what she needed to get in and out of the tub easier. She had been having trouble stepping into the tub this solved that problem for her. I had ordered two thinking I would have to stack them we ended up only needing the one but she has a very low tub to begin with. Great product very well made slip resistant made with seniors in mind.</li>
    <li> Perfect to help Mom get in the car.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s plastic construction has not been able to stand up to our handling.  Chunks of It&#x27;s outer perimeter have broken off.  Perhaps we are more abusive than others?</li>
    <li> Product works wonderful is very helpful for my mother to enter our whirl pool tub and get out of wonderful</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a short gal with mobility issues and steps are a particular problem.  I can&#x27;t reach the second shelf of my kitchen cupboards and needed help with the big step from my family room (formerly a carport) into the hallway.  I was using a book for that.  I have under shelf fluorescent lights in the kitchen but could not reach them to change bulbs.  Can&#x27;t even get to the first step of a step stool without using some elevation (book).  Now I use this to get to the first step of a 3-step stool and use smaller books on the remaining 2 steps (I push them to the right side of the step).  I can then get from the floor to the first step, then step on the book to get to the next step, etc.  Bought 2 of these and love them.  They are lightweight and easily portable.  Just the right height to reach the above items and more.  Even use one to use with my step exercises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing not mentioned in the description was how to stack them.  You have to remove the 4 round white pegs pictured in the photo.  If you turn the step over, you will see the 4 stacking pegs which were designed into the mold - they slip into the slots opened once the pegs are removed.  Have not done this but in looking at the design/construction of the step, it looks sturdy and very safe.  I really like these and Amazon had the best price and qualified for the free shipping.</li>
    <li> The stop is strong and stable and makes getting into a high sided tub much easier for my little wife.  Good solid product.</li>
    <li> Works well as a step. However, there is only one step per package. You will need to buy more if you want a higher step, or one step on each side of the bath tub.  The add could be misunderstood  if you want a multiple step. Good product, has many uses.</li>
    <li> JUST RIGHT.  FEEL SAVE.  KNOW SLIPPING.  JUST HAD MY TUB/SHOWER  CUT INTO  A BIG &amp;#62; U &amp;#60; SHAPE ON THE SIDE.&lt;br /&gt;  BATH STEP  HELPS WITH THAT LAST LITTLE STEP UP.</li>
    <li> it is perfect for my purposes</li>
    <li> I have a gardne tub that is a bit of a step up and down--particularly for shorter people. This step has helped unbelievably. Frankly, I&#x27;m not sure how we got along without it. I&#x27;m not short, but even I find it easier stepping out of the tub and onto this step. Initially, I feared it would take up too much space, but it fits between the toilet and tub without problem.</li>
    <li> I bought this step to help me to get to level of my premiere tub, When I first got my tub I didn&#x27;t have hard time raising feet to the 6 in height to get in it..but now I am having trouble, in fact fell 2 times in bathroom trying to get in tub, had to call 911 to get help to get up.  I have no strength in my left leg and have blood clots on both knees from an car injury 2 yrs ago, that is not healing,But this step is AWESOME!!! I bought 2 to stack up against the tub, and that was good but needed help even to step on that, I bought 2-more and stacked one more high and one alone and now just have to step up 2 inches, then 6 inches and seems like I am walking straight into tub..They are also great because I do weigh over 300 lbs and they work great because they make me feel safe as I get into tub.</li>
    <li> This is an adequate bath step and I especially like the way they stack. These have been very helpful for my disability. I just wish they were more attractive. Electric blue color screams disability.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, but I had to return it because it was too big to fit where it was needed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this step to assist my spouse in getting on tour buses while we vacation. It is small enough to carry around (in a bag), and light weight.  This is essential for someone who has difficulty lifting their leg high enough to reach the first step on a vehicle.</li>
    <li> These are just what I was looking for. I need that extra security to get my self in and out of the tub.&lt;br /&gt; I have problem lifting leg&#x27;s up and this takes pressure off my hip&#x27;s and let&#x27;s me get in and out with&lt;br /&gt;the feeling of safety.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 2 due to I travel for work and family and I am always in Hotel&#x27;s that you run into the handicap&lt;br /&gt;room&#x27;s are gone.&lt;br /&gt;These are a wonderful size and give you the comfort of knowing your stable.&lt;br /&gt;A total 10 and I will recommend to other&#x27;s I know who may need help.</li>
