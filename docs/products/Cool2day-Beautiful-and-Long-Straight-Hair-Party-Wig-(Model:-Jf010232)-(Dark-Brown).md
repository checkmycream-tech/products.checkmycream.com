      <li>Love this wig!</li>
      <li>but my mom looks so cute with it!</li>
      <li>NIce brown color as well.</li>
      <li>Looks exactly like the picture, seems very good quality, and is thicker than a lot of wigs, which makes it really nice to work with and looks more convincing, too.</li>
      <li>I had to miss a very important event</li>
      <li>My Grand daughter loves the wig.</li>
      <li>my mom looks so cute in it</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s for sure</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Dark Brown&amp;#34; is more like a copper colour.</li>
      <li>So hair looks healthy.</li>
      <li>I love cool2day wigs.</li>
      <li>Considering I didn&#x27;t pay more than $8 for this wig (including shipping and handling)</li>
      <li>this is 4 my grand daughter</li>
      <li>Def glad I got this to use on days when I feel like a change or don&#x27;t wanna do my hair :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay for a costume wig.</li>
      <li>This wig is simply beautiful, and it comes with a wig cap (but different than others I have received with their wigs before -</li>
      <li>it actually turned out great</li>
      <li>The wig is so smooth too.</li>
      <li>not all American wigs ain&#x27;t great research and find a wig that suits ur frame</li>
      <li>IT WAS CHEAP</li>
      <li>Though the wig tangled easily, it was brushable and survived a mild storm.</li>
      <li>My lovely Grand daughter is to young to need a wig in this way.</li>
      <li>Very nice and long.</li>
      <li>It even handled me brushing it hahahaha :)</li>
      <li>It also arrived in great condition, no horrid tangles, just a few stray strands here and there.</li>
      <li>Costume store wigs are rarely sufficiently accurate for cosplay, and can still cost as much as twenty dollars.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to have to wear a hat with this wig if I&#x27;m going to go outside with it on, but it looks nice if you can make it work with you.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth trying to either wear as is or re-color.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t a hair quality wig by any means, but the wig was adequate for my cosplay and came at a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>some people just wont look right in it</li>
      <li>but hey for $7.00 buy cheap get cheap stick with American style wigs but</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more from this seller.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m working on taking the shine out right now, but straight out of the bag it won&#x27;t pass for hair at all.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the rich dark brown color.</li>
      <li>it is very smooth long</li>
      <li>however, the different shades of brown make it look more realistic, and the fibers have a slight reddish tint that I really liked.</li>
      <li>ooooone thing is that the &amp;#34;dark brown&amp;#34; is a little bit reddish but I personally like that even more :)</li>
      <li>The wig is much shorter than it appears in the picture, and the color is a bit lighter.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much for the price, but I purchased it to wear as a costume</li>
      <li>The wig only cost about $7 with free shipping, so I wasn&#x27;t really expecting that much.</li>
      <li>I recommend this wig highly!</li>
      <li>Since I (and many others) cannot afford costly professional-grade wigs, generally the budget option is a generic costume store wig.</li>
      <li>They are always gorgeous with very natural and subtle highlights.</li>
      <li>But I must say I was pleasantly surprised!!</li>
      <li>I think I definitely got my moneys worth.</li>
      <li>Very low maintenance compared to my other more pricey wigs.</li>
      <li>The hair was very pretty longer than i expected.</li>
      <li>Upon removing the wig from the package, I noticed how smooth it was, and it was just a little shiny.</li>
      <li>A pretty high quality wig for such a low price.</li>
      <li>I use mane n tail detangler spray to keep it from tangling and this has worked quite well so far, so I recommend this.</li>
      <li>This wig feels natural and looks natural.  </li>
      <li>Hair is soft silky and has a sheen as though there is a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>, I would not wear it in public due to the fit.</li>
      <li>but hey its a wig lol And not at all as fake looking as I expected.</li>
      <li>It also tangles quite a bit, but that&#x27;s expected of a straight hair .</li>
      <li>I will order another in the near future.</li>
      <li>The wig is a bit on the thin side though (just a bit!), and the bangs had to be trimmed a little bit to match the picture, but for less than $10.00, I am more than satisfied with this purchase.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re cut choppy, nothing at all like the picture, could care less about how shiny it is, because that&#x27;s easily fixable, basically get to cut the wig myself to make it look like the picture.</li>

<li> The bangs are actually quite long, I sweep them to the side and spray it with a little Paula Young wig spray to help keep it in place.</li>
<li> It took quite a while for it to finally ship to me, but it finally arrived after a month and a half (the very last day of the estimated delivery time).</li>
<li> IT CAME AFTER 30 DAYS, I WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS WIG..</li>
<li> The bangs however are too long</li>
<li> Came earlier than expected.</li>

<li> The bangs came a little bit uneven, so I had to cut them straight myself.</li>
<li> Can say I&#x27;m very fond of this wig it tangles in minutes the way it is cut is not good</li>
<li> I ordered 3 dark brown wigs and got 2 orange looking wigs and 1 blonde wig.</li>
<li> I had really hoped that there was a mistake &amp; was a little annoyed.</li>
<li> just need to be trimmed slightly to your liking.</li>
<li> What a waste and the bangs aren&#x27;t even symmetrical.</li>
<li> I never write bad reviews, but this one really pissed me off</li>
<li> So I was totally a bit skeptical about buying this wig.</li>
<li> The cap is quite rough, and sometimes peeks through the hair fibers, which I found to be quite thin.</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t brush it too hard though, but for the price its a steal.  </li>
<li> Wig is a little bit thin but it works for my purposes.</li>
<li> The real problem, though, was that it&#x27;s hORRIBLY shiny.</li>
<li> Then I contacted Amazon via chat and the agent made it worse.</li>
<li> I would recommend this wig to anyone looking to casually cosplay and/or for a Halloween party.</li>
<li> Otherwise it&#x27;s not too bad for the price.</li>
<li> and I am very disappointed.</li>
<li> THIS WIG WAS TERRIBLE.</li>

    <li> This wig feels natural and looks natural.  You can&#x27;t brush it too hard though, but for the price its a steal.  I recommend this wig highly!</li>
    <li> Came earlier than expected. Wig is a little bit thin but it works for my purposes. Bangs are long too but that can be cut back. Otherwise it&#x27;s not too bad for the price.</li>
    <li> this is 4 my grand daughter she wanted this wig 2 wear 4 school it is still at my house she will get it when i go over there 4 thanksgiving  i have seen it i like it is very smooth long i try it on so i can tell her how it looks</li>
    <li> Can say I&#x27;m very fond of this wig it tangles in minutes the way it is cut is not good but hey for $7.00 buy cheap get cheap stick with American style wigs but not all American wigs ain&#x27;t great research and find a wig that suits ur frame</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 dark brown wigs and got 2 orange looking wigs and 1 blonde wig. Then I contacted Amazon via chat and the agent made it worse. I had to miss a very important event and she didn&#x27;t care about that. The wigs are nothing like they look on the photo and I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The wig only cost about $7 with free shipping, so I wasn&#x27;t really expecting that much. It took quite a while for it to finally ship to me, but it finally arrived after a month and a half (the very last day of the estimated delivery time). The cap is quite rough, and sometimes peeks through the hair fibers, which I found to be quite thin. The bangs came a little bit uneven, so I had to cut them straight myself. It also tangles quite a bit, but that&#x27;s expected of a straight hair . The color is very nice however, the different shades of brown make it look more realistic, and the fibers have a slight reddish tint that I really liked. I&#x27;m going to have to wear a hat with this wig if I&#x27;m going to go outside with it on, but it looks nice if you can make it work with you.</li>
    <li> The wig is much shorter than it appears in the picture, and the color is a bit lighter. The real problem, though, was that it&#x27;s hORRIBLY shiny. I&#x27;m working on taking the shine out right now, but straight out of the bag it won&#x27;t pass for hair at all. It&#x27;s also a pain to brush out because it sheds so easily.&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t a hair quality wig by any means, but the wig was adequate for my cosplay and came at a very reasonable price. Since I (and many others) cannot afford costly professional-grade wigs, generally the budget option is a generic costume store wig.

    <li> Wig just as beautiful as in the picture. Perfect fit. Hair is soft silky and has a sheen as though there is a moisturizer. So hair looks healthy.</li>
    <li> OMG I love this wig!! It&#x27;s not itchy or anything and it came with the wig cap so that&#x27;s good too. I needed to trim the bangs a liiiiiittle bit cause they were in my eyes but otherwise it&#x27;s very good quality! It even handled me brushing it hahahaha :)&lt;br /&gt;Just ooooone thing is that the &amp;#34;dark brown&amp;#34; is a little bit reddish but I personally like that even more :)&lt;br /&gt;All in all, great wig :)</li>
    <li> This brown in person is lighter than I&#x27;d hoped for but for the price it&#x27;s worth trying to either wear as is or re-color.</li>
    <li> Considering I didn&#x27;t pay more than $8 for this wig (including shipping and handling) I think I definitely got my moneys worth. As long as you take care of it and don&#x27;t wear it constantly it should last a bit. I got it for work since I have short purple hair and corporate doesn&#x27;t like it. I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more from this seller.</li>
    <li> I love cool2day wigs. They are always gorgeous with very natural and subtle highlights. This wig is simply beautiful, and it comes with a wig cap (but different than others I have received with their wigs before - still, it does its job). The bangs are actually quite long, I sweep them to the side and spray it with a little Paula Young wig spray to help keep it in place. The hair has long layers. I absolutely love the rich dark brown color. The wig is so smooth too. I use mane n tail detangler spray to keep it from tangling and this has worked quite well so far, so I recommend this. Love this wig!</li>
    <li> So I was totally a bit skeptical about buying this wig. Especially for the price it was at. But I must say I was pleasantly surprised!! Very nice and long. Bangs are great just need to be trimmed slightly to your liking. NIce brown color as well. A lil shiny but hey its a wig lol And not at all as fake looking as I expected. Def glad I got this to use on days when I feel like a change or don&#x27;t wanna do my hair :)</li>
    <li> This wig arrived about a week earlier than the estimated shipping date, which is a plus. It also arrived in great condition, no horrid tangles, just a few stray strands here and there. Upon removing the wig from the package, I noticed how smooth it was, and it was just a little shiny. The wig is a bit on the thin side though (just a bit!), and the bangs had to be trimmed a little bit to match the picture, but for less than $10.00, I am more than satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> THIS WIG WAS TERRIBLE. IT CAME AFTER 30 DAYS, I WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS WIG..IT WAS CHEAP, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. I WENT AND BOUGHT ONE CLOSER TO MY AREA AND THREW THIS IN THE TRASH...WILL NOT EVER BUY FROM THIS PERSON AGAIN.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for a costume wig. It doesn&#x27;t stay on too well. I didn&#x27;t expect much for the price, but I purchased it to wear as a costume so it serves it&#x27;s purpose, I would not wear it in public due to the fit.</li>
    <li> The hair was very pretty longer than i expected. The bangs however are too long and when i try to sweep it to the side it shows the cap.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t have a choice but to use it. I had really hoped that there was a mistake &amp; was a little annoyed.</li>
    <li> This was one of my favorite wigs from Amazon and a great buy. I will order another in the near future.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t leave home without it. A pretty high quality wig for such a low price. Serves me well on night&#x27;s out on the town with my friends. Very low maintenance compared to my other more pricey wigs.</li>
    <li> My Grand daughter loves the wig. It looks really good on her. The only con to this order is why we had to order it. My lovely Grand daughter is to young to need a wig in this way. The pros: Looks very nice, price was excellent, delivery and packaging was excellent also.</li>
    <li> Looks exactly like the picture, seems very good quality, and is thicker than a lot of wigs, which makes it really nice to work with and looks more convincing, too.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Dark Brown&amp;#34; is more like a copper colour. What a waste and the bangs aren&#x27;t even symmetrical. They&#x27;re cut choppy, nothing at all like the picture, could care less about how shiny it is, because that&#x27;s easily fixable, basically get to cut the wig myself to make it look like the picture. I never write bad reviews, but this one really pissed me off, you definitely get what you pay for. Not buying from here again.</li>
    <li> my mom looks so cute in it it actually turned out great some people just wont look right in it that&#x27;s for sure but my mom looks so cute with it! it is what it says it is no fakes here!!!</li>
