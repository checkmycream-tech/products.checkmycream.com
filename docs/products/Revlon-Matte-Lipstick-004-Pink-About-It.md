      <li>This is a great coral color if you have cool toned skin.</li>
      <li>This Colour is Beautiful, It has the right tone of colour.</li>
      <li>The color isn&#x27;t quite true on the picture, but it&#x27;s gorgeous nonetheless.</li>
      <li>Very vibrant great for darker skin tones doesn&#x27;t have that ashy look to it.</li>
      <li>This is now my favorite matte lipstick.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed how silky it feels compared to most matte lipsticks.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m In love with this colour.</li>
      <li>I love this color.</li>
      <li>A perfect velvet pink, I love it.</li>
      <li>it clutters &amp; it doesnt easily blend.</li>
      <li>Luckily I&#x27;ve just found it at amazon and am so glad.</li>
      <li>The color is perfect and it is the most astonishing matte finish I have found even with more expensive brands like Chanel and MAC.</li>
      <li>Too light.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a very bright pink!</li>
      <li>I have bought many other colors and none were as good as this one.</li>
      <li>I like to wear it with just one light coat for minimal coverage, or two very light coats for something more opaque.</li>
      <li>Goes on really smooth not dry like most matte lipsticks though you do need to moisturize your lips before putting it on.</li>
      <li>Best red shade lipstick I have bought hands down...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice product, but be careful about color choice.</li>
      <li>Its more of a bright PINK pink but its so pretty.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t pull off orange-y corals but this has just enough pink that it looks great on me.</li>
      <li>I recommend anyone who wants to make their lips look irresistible.</li>
      <li>I have very pigmented lips though so that could be the problem.</li>
      <li>seller was very prompt.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just mad Revlon Matte lipstic, they&#x27;re the perfect matte lip.</li>
      <li>Although the color is not true to the picture, this lipstick is a great pink.</li>
      <li>This is a great red based pink without too much red.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, it is a very pale peach (in the orange range) and not a color that many people would wear.</li>
      <li>The color is slightly lighter than what Iwas hoping for (still a pretty color though) and the matte finish is exactly what I was hoping for</li>
      <li>the difference is that pink about it is softer with more pink, almost coral like.</li>
      <li>Okay, I usually wear a lot of lipstick, mostly dark colors, and I was trying to achieve a certain look.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more pink and less reddish brown.</li>
      <li>When I bought it I was looking for more of a deep drownish pink or even a purplely pink.</li>
      <li>My Mom was having a hard time finding this color, which had been a favorite for a long time.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this item. Will buy again from this seller.</li>
    <li> Best red shade lipstick I have bought hands down...its really superb</li>
    <li> The photo does not do justice to the actual color. It&#x27;s more pink and less reddish brown. It&#x27;s a color similar to strawberry suede by revlon..the difference is that pink about it is softer with more pink, almost coral like.</li>
    <li> This is a great red based pink without too much red. Very vibrant great for darker skin tones doesn&#x27;t have that ashy look to it. Goes on really smooth not dry like most matte lipsticks though you do need to moisturize your lips before putting it on.</li>
    <li> Got this lipstick about three years ago and loved it! I went to buy a second tube at the store and they told me they didn&#x27;t carry Revlon matte lipsticks anymore. Luckily I&#x27;ve just found it at amazon and am so glad. The color is perfect and it is the most astonishing matte finish I have found even with more expensive brands like Chanel and MAC. Recommended!</li>
    <li> Although the color is not true to the picture, this lipstick is a great pink. I enjoyed how silky it feels compared to most matte lipsticks. Great buy</li>
    <li> I love this color. seller was very prompt.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I thought it would be the color in the picture.... it isn&#x27;t. it&#x27;s a very bright pink! ew. it is matte though.</li>
    <li> This is now my favorite matte lipstick. When I bought it I was looking for more of a deep drownish pink or even a purplely pink. Its more of a bright PINK pink but its so pretty.</li>
    <li> Beautiful Color &amp; Perfect &amp; Fast</li>
    <li> This is a great coral color if you have cool toned skin. I can&#x27;t pull off orange-y corals but this has just enough pink that it looks great on me. I wore it a lot over the summer. I took away one star because if I apply it 2-3 coats I think it gets a bit... heavy. I like to wear it with just one light coat for minimal coverage, or two very light coats for something more opaque. I have very pigmented lips though so that could be the problem. Revlon&#x27;s mattes are always perfect and this is no exception. Sad they have discontinued it.</li>
    <li> My lips are pigmented, gives a purple hint on my NC 30 skin (medium beige, yellow undertones). Besides several swatches are needed for the color to pay off.</li>
    <li> Okay, I usually wear a lot of lipstick, mostly dark colors, and I was trying to achieve a certain look. I have bought many other colors and none were as good as this one. I recommend anyone who wants to make their lips look irresistible. I have fair skin and it looks awesome.</li>
    <li> Color didn&#x27;t match picture. Too light.</li>
    <li> This is terrible, it looks like crayon on lips.</li>
    <li> its not as matte as i thought! it clutters &amp; it doesnt easily blend. im havin a hard time applying it;)</li>
    <li> The lipstick was dry. Would recommend just going to your local walgreens.</li>
    <li> I just got this lipstick in the mail and was very disappointed with the color. It has the word &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; in the title and online it looks like a strawberry pink, rather dark.  Unfortunately, it is a very pale peach (in the orange range) and not a color that many people would wear.</li>
    <li> This Colour is Beautiful, It has the right tone of colour. I&#x27;m In love with this colour. Been using it for over 2 years now!!!!</li>
    <li> The color is slightly lighter than what Iwas hoping for (still a pretty color though) and the matte finish is exactly what I was hoping for</li>
    <li> My Mom was having a hard time finding this color, which had been a favorite for a long time.  She was very happy to&lt;br /&gt;once again have it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just mad Revlon Matte lipstic, they&#x27;re the perfect matte lip. I&#x27;m obsessed, constantly looking for them at my local drugstore. This is one that evaded me for a long while, until it occured to me to purchase on-line. The color isn&#x27;t quite true on the picture, but it&#x27;s gorgeous nonetheless.
