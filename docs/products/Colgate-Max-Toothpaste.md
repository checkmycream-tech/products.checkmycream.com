    <li> Not as good as its counter parts but sure leaves me feeling refreshed for a longer time.</li>
    <li> I really like the mint.  I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Love how it makes my mouth feel so fresh and clean. I use this along with the Optic White (both in rotation). Not a bad price either buying with prime savings.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpaste.  I love how fresh my mouth is after using this.  And I love that Colgate uses the flip top. I buy this with Subscribe and Save and have it delivered monthly.</li>
    <li> Good toothpaste, not my favorite compare to some other Colgate paste.</li>
    <li> Good price, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This is great! Not only does it help clean the teeth, it also acts as a mouth wash!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve come to realize that this is my favorite toothpaste and that I shouldn&#x27;t leave it ever again. It leaves a nice minty feeling and I like the way it foams. Also, one of the things I really like is how my mouth still feels normal the next day (coz you know how others leave a weird scent or taste). This is my go to flavor because spearmint is awesome</li>
    <li> I thought I ordered the 24 pack and only got one tube of toothpaste. I have the picture from where I ordered the toothpaste and if clearly states it is a 24 pack. Disappointed in the false advertising.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a toothpaste connoisseur, and this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t promise a whole lot (pretty sure &amp;#34;clean teeth&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;fresh breath&amp;#34; are standard toothpaste features). On that front, it works well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one caveat: I like stand-up caps, because then you have an option to put the tube in a medicine cabinet or stand it on the counter... or you can lay it in a drawer or wherever else you like to store your toothpaste. This product doesn&#x27;t come with one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, it was easy enough to unscrew the stand-up cap from the tube we had just finished and put it on this one. We&#x27;re resourceful like that. ;)</li>

    <li> Love the flavor of this classic toothpaste and it offers great value.</li>

    <li> Then this came along. Great taste, clean feeling.  Amazing.</li>
    <li> I really like this brand and fresh flavor of toothpaste and I can purchase and have delivered from Amazon right to my door cheaper than going to town.</li>
    <li> Good, but doesn&#x27;t pack as much of a mint kick as I was hoping</li>
    <li> I purchase this toothpaste through my subscribe and save and I am so glad I added it to be delivered monthly. No longer do I have to worry about forgetting to buy it at the grocery store. I like the smell of this toothpaste, its very clean and refreshing smelling. The texture is nice. The flip cap is so much easier to use than having to screw off a top and worry about dropping or losing the top. The taste is nice too, minty but not too minty.</li>
    <li> This is of a review for subscribe &amp; Save. I love the Amazon Subscribe and Save program! The things we constantly ran out of we now have all the time!</li>
    <li> very convenient! good quality, good price.</li>
    <li> this item tends to make my teeth clean.  if you want to save money on dental bills please brush twice a day, whether you use the Crest item, the Colgate item or any other competitor!  don&#x27;t ever pay more than $0.50 per ounce for toothpaste.  enjoy!</li>
