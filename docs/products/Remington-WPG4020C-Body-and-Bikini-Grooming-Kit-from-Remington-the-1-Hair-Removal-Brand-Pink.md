      <li>The foil shaver does not do as impressive a job with surface shaving.  </li>
      <li>Very happy about that.</li>
      <li>Excellent product!</li>
      <li>Trust me it is the best.</li>
      <li>I cannot find the perfect shave until now..</li>
      <li>This is the best trimmer I have found.</li>
      <li>The function is excellent.</li>
      <li>in that it is NOT even good at being a body hair trimmer!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very, VERY pleased!  </li>
      <li>size is great.</li>
      <li>The price was great, but the product?</li>
      <li>/&gt;Conceptually great idea .The</li>
      <li>But because it is so great otherwise</li>
      <li>This product is great in theory...</li>
      <li>but thats where it stops being great for me.</li>
      <li>A great value @ $10.000.</li>
      <li>My gf is happy with the product.</li>
      <li>I used the trim setting and that worked great every time for my bikini area.</li>
      <li>That makes me happy.</li>
      <li>I think this is a great product.</li>
      <li>and it did a good job and came with a travel case.</li>
      <li>pin.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it is a good set.</li>
      <li>I LOVED this while it worked.</li>
      <li>It does a good cleanup job but keep in mind</li>
      <li>Good close shave.</li>
      <li>Good luck ladies.  </li>
      <li>the bikini attachment does a good job with trimming and shaping.  </li>
      <li>but it worked out good for me.</li>
      <li>The attachments are good idea.</li>
      <li>It does a fairly good job of trimming inside the bikini area (as well as out)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many hair removals products over the years and find that a good razor and soap does the best job for a close shave, yet takes more time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I still have the receipt,</li>
      <li>Well, I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s wireless too!</li>
      <li>Love this thing!</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>Rating went from a 2 to a 4 and will go to 5 if I get more than a cpl of uses out of it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Absolutely does NOT work!!!!!</li>
      <li>Great battery life; close, smooth shave; all the attachments work as advertised.</li>
      <li>and I liked the exfoliator for soothing my face after using.</li>
      <li>It comes with a nice matching color pouch that fits everything including all the attachments.</li>
      <li>exfoliating brush is a nice addition and works well.</li>
      <li>So given that out of the five leg/bikini shavers that I&#x27;ve had, I&#x27;ve never had a foil shaver I liked, so I&#x27;m not even going to review</li>
      <li>It is not as good as a wax, but with the bikini trimmer followed by the foil shaver I am satisfied with the shave for my bikini area and under arms, which lasts about a week before I need to touch it up again.</li>
      <li>I liked the idea of this product.  </li>
      <li>It worked well in the shower, and the hanging hole is quite handy.  </li>
      <li>I really liked the look of this product in Target.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and it fits nicely in your hand.</li>
      <li>but honestly it didn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>I was using this for &amp;#34;personal grooming&amp;#34; and I liked it</li>
      <li>but once it did it was nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nothing spectacular, but what do you expect for $20?</li>
      <li>I got a handy dandy mirror and looked.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very light machine, and very easy to hold.</li>
      <li>Just as good as the original I purchased.  </li>
      <li>It works well and gives a good clean shave.</li>
      <li>Thanks it is good and fits good</li>
      <li>While this is a nice idea, I refer to use a razor where I have a bit more control and more to work with.</li>
      <li>This is for on the go, quick hair removal and works just as good as the more pricey models.</li>
      <li>I would love to know how this passed the testing phase at the company.</li>
      <li>The trimmer worked okay, but didn&#x27;t get a close shave like</li>
      <li>Too many ends-</li>
      <li>I had a Remington Bikini Grooming Kit that I used for many years.  </li>
      <li>experimented many brands</li>
      <li>The shaver itself did an okay job on my armpit areas</li>
      <li>It is absolutely my favorite razor.</li>
      <li>I love the spinning exfoliator brush</li>
      <li>There has to be better products out there.</li>
      <li>and glad I did not even a pay a cent for it.</li>
      <li>I would have been better off buying a men&#x27;s electric razor and something like the Olay Pro exfoliating brysh system.</li>
      <li>Truthfully, it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
      <li>If you want the top layer of your hmmm..</li>
      <li>so I have not put more strength into it.</li>
      <li>Not my favorite</li>
      <li>This razor is ok.</li>
      <li>read all of the instructions to make sure and it still didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>This is the latest model</li>
      <li>The shaver head does not pick up the hair, no matter how many times you go over it.</li>
      <li>This is just okay.  </li>
      <li>When I first got this product I liked it!</li>
      <li>My favorite attachments were the bikini trimmer and the adjustable length guide.</li>
      <li>I bought this for her, but have found that it works better than what I&#x27;d been using for my eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>It says shower safe</li>
      <li>I could never get more than 2 uses out of each battery</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I love this razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This thing was ok as a trimmer but</li>
      <li>For the money it does an okay job</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>It has to be better, since I&#x27;m gicing close to 20, right?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The trimmer is OK for light use and the shaver is best for maneuvering more smaller places.</li>
      <li>It is alright Pretty good price.</li>
      <li>I have very, very fine light hair on my legs almost to the point that I would not have to shave unless I wanted to.</li>
      <li>I mostly use the trimmer with the clear guide and without and it works great both ways.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;it gives a great result for those of us whose skin is to sensitive to&lt;br /&gt;wax.</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love it but it didnt come with attachments or a carrying case</li>
    <li> It chopped me up and made my lady bits bleed! Ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that! It&#x27;s not like I have a saggy JJ either, this thing just is pure torture. Don&#x27;t do it!</li>
    <li> Foil shaver really doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> The foil head did not take off a single hair. The buffer thing did nothing. The trimmer worked okay, but didn&#x27;t get a close shave like the foil thing was supposed to do and it cut the hell out of my vag. I was as gentle as I could possibly be and still it looks like I shaved with a broken piece of glass. This thing is a total POS. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> three weeks after bought it stopped working consistently.  Sometimes it turns on and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> I had a Remington Bikini Grooming Kit that I used for many years.  It recently died on me and I really wanted to purchase the same kit, however, it is no longer in production.  This is the latest model and I&#x27;m very, VERY pleased!  Just as good as the original I purchased.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Very poor quality!  I purchased this item for my bikini area and the product does not give a smooth shave. It was uncomfortable to use and my skin was pulled and the shaver left red marks on my skin.. I used it only a few times and then the vibrating blade came loose and then it was completely useless. Threw it away. Honestly, this is one time that it is worth it to pay attention to the negative reviews or you will waste your money.</li>
    <li> It stopped working after a month. And I used it only thrice mostly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m shock. Was scared to get it but it worked out good for me.</li>
    <li> the guide is flimsy and there is only one guide to choose from for trimming, the foil head that comes with it is useless</li>
    <li> This really does not shave much of the hair, it shaves a bit its a waste of money, I even thought it would work but honestly it didn&#x27;t, I have had this for a while now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big electric razor fan, but thought I would try this one out. I really like the bikini trimmer and that is by far my favorite part about this kit. The razor is good, but doesn&#x27;t compare to a regular blade as I feel I still get a closer shave with those. But I do like this and it is small enough to take when I travel, which is nice. I also like the fact that if I just need a quick touch up I can just pull this out, instead of jumping into the shower, etc.</li>
    <li> In one word, useless. I have very, very fine light hair on my legs almost to the point that I would not have to shave unless I wanted to. The first leg did okay but on the second leg, the shaver stopped working. Completely stopped for no reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could understand if I was shaving coarse, thick hair like a man&#x27;s beard but this was the easiest hair to shave. I threw it away and used the trusty disposable Bic.</li>
    <li> Might die after 3 months, and yes it can be a butcher 😫. Now it doesn&#x27;t even work.  Now am tired of trying female trimmers am heading on the men&#x27;s aisle.</li>
    <li> I started out with a Clio shaver and took it back the same day because it broke after five minutes of use. I used my return money to get this and, while it&#x27;s not perfect, it is SIGNIFICANTLY better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews said that the foil shaver didn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s definitely not great, but I&#x27;ve never had a foil shaver that was worth anything. They always pull my hair. So given that out of the five leg/bikini shavers that I&#x27;ve had, I&#x27;ve never had a foil shaver I liked, so I&#x27;m not even going to review that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliating brush is a nice addition and works well. The shaver/trimmer head also works and doesn&#x27;t pull, although it doesn&#x27;t get very very close to the skin, so you may have to use a regular razor to smooth things over in a few spots.</li>
    <li> This items work very well. It does everything it says it does. Does not look cheap. Batteries come with the kit.</li>
    <li> This shaver works really well and is easy to handle.</li>
    <li> This  tool is my miracle worker! I never felt so human before! Using this is bliss!</li>
    <li> Great battery life; close, smooth shave; all the attachments work as advertised.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does. The thing doesn&#x27;t really vibrate at all and the face cleaner head doesn&#x27;t move. The razor doesn&#x27;t do any better than a regular one and it says it&#x27;s waterproof but it quick working in the shower. Not worth the extra money, just buy a regular bikini shaver.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with an electric shaver. It does a fairly good job of trimming inside the bikini area (as well as out) but I just did not feel comfortable with it. You have to hold it at an angle if you want it to trim properly and I could feel it puling at my hairs. The shaver itself did an okay job on my armpit areas but I honestly don&#x27;t think this shaver is worth the money. I am much more comfortable using a regular razor. If you are experienced with using an electric razor you may feel differently.</li>
    <li> I have been very displeased with this product. The device is not very effective at hair removal. You have to work very hard to get the results you want. Although this factor of it makes it annoying, I would say the worst part about this product is that when I tried to use the foil shaver, it cut me several times. And where it didn&#x27;t cut me, it left a terrible razor burn. It didn&#x27;t even get rid of the hair I was trying to remove. I would only recommend this product to someone who enjoys getting cut and burned by their razors. Thanks to this product I now look worse than I thought I did when I chose to remove the hair.</li>
    <li> This is a waste of money and does absolutely nothing, the foil shaver doesn&#x27;t work at all, the exfoliater is to sensitive to use, and the trimmer does absolutely nothing with the guide on it, only works with it off and with it off its VERY EASY to cut yourself with</li>
    <li> It works well for the job it is supposed to do, however I wish the cutting edge was wider.</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting. The hair trimmer doesn&#x27;t work. But I just use the exfoliating brush</li>
    <li> Such a good product. I&#x27;ve had mine for about a month or two and so far its been great. No nicks or cuts.</li>
    <li> I definitely don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews that say they got cut up by this! It&#x27;s SOOO gentle! It works though! The electric file isn&#x27;t super effective without a fair amount of pressure (which was scary at first given the area I was taking it to!) but it does the job. The razor and exfoliator are fantastic. Overall, it&#x27;s WAY better than shaving with a regular razor, and you can do it out of the shower.</li>
    <li> Poor quality! Doesnt take the hairs off .I&#x27;ve experimented many brands I cannot find the perfect shave until now..</li>
    <li> This product is great in theory...but thats where it stops being great for me. Not very powerful at all. The only part I can use with any success is the brush head, but $15 to use only a 1/4 of the product &amp;#34;features&amp;#34; leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I would have been better off buying a men&#x27;s electric razor and something like the Olay Pro exfoliating brysh system. I would have spent more money, but would have been happier with the products.</li>
    <li> It works well but still pulls/snags a hair around my bikini line and that always throws me off.</li>
    <li> great product, actually removed hair, be careful with it though.....can cut you</li>
    <li> I used it 2 times and it died. I changed the battery a few times but that didn&#x27;t fix the problem. I should have stuck with a cheaper product.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite but it does the job.</li>
    <li> This razor is ok. I never used the attachment because it didn&#x27;t work well and would clog easily. It stopped working after a year of use. I will try a different brand that is a little wider and see if it lasts.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read the reviews before ordering this item. The shaver head does not pick up the hair, no matter how many times you go over it. I don&#x27;t understand why someone said in their review that this is just a trimmer and not a shaver. It comes with both the trimmer head and the shaver head. I will update my review after trying the trimmer head and see if it is any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything else about it seems fine, it has a hook so that you can hang it in the shower and a little travel bag.</li>
    <li> After reading all the negative reviews, I was not expecting much frankly when I gave this to my wife.  However, we were a little surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was decent and fairly easy to remove the product.  The shaver comes with a decent bag that will work for travel. A single AA battery is included. Product build was OK, about what was expected for a product of this type and in this price range.  I doubt it will take more than a few drops on a hard tile bathroom floor.  The design leaves a lot to be desired.  For example, it simply does not work with the guide on the trimmer- or at least, we could not figure out how to get it to work.  We had to revert to no guide, and the trimmer did a decent job of getting hair down to a point where it made sense to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in short, using it as a trimmer (without guide) to get hair down to a length where a razor is better suited is perhaps the best application of this product.  It is not a &amp;#34;finishing&amp;#34; razor by any means in my opinion.  If you get it at a good price point of $15 or less, I opine it may be worth it for you depending on how you use it.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my two girls and they absolutely loved it!!  It works everywhere.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Usually small shavers like this one are rechargeable. This product is not and loses its charge fast. For the money it does an okay job but I think next time I&#x27;ll buy something a little more expensive that works better. I&#x27;m not very impressed.</li>
    <li> C&#x27;mon People! If it&#x27;s $15.00 or less, you should know what&#x27;s coming. Don&#x27;t buy! It gives a tiny trim and that&#x27;s all. Am I the only one who wants NO hair on my legs from this?</li>
    <li> bought it at target. it worked okay at first, then decided to stop working. I&#x27;ve had it for less than a month.</li>
    <li> Yeah so I got this at walmart thinking \\&quot;Oooooooooo 19.99, what a deal!\\&quot;  I was way excited to try it... but as others have said, the foil does absolutely nothing, neither does the trimmer head.  The only thing that does anything is the teeth one.  Holy Crap do you need to be careful using that lol  I&#x27;m normally a shaver, i just shave once a week but I saw this thinking it would be nice to save some time, but it took the same amount of time.  The only difference is I&#x27;m happier with the shaving results.  I&#x27;ll probably keep it, since I dont like to return beauty products, but I wont use it religiously.</li>
    <li> I bought it from Walmart....it didnt even last two months. It says shower safe but then it slipped out of my hands and the teeth broke but I didnt notice until the next shave and I cut up myself. I was using this for &amp;#34;personal grooming&amp;#34; and I liked it but it took so long to get through my thick coarse hair but once it did it was nice. But some of the attachments had no purpose. Like the so called clear trimmer attachment, that did nothing and the little exfoliating brush just got tangled. It was only good when I was bald and by then..smh. I used shaving cream with it but it seemed to get in the way. It was faster to do dry but then hair gets everywhere. There was no way to rinse the hairs out the blade; no way to clean inside. There was just a buildup of hairs inside the mechanism. Disappointed. Also, the |&amp;#34;|foiler&amp;#34; didnt help to smooth much down for me eihter</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this several times in at Walmart or CVS as I&#x27;ve yet to see them carry anything else. It will make you nick you to the point of bloodshed, especially if you are in a hurry and as stated in other reviews certain parts of it don&#x27;t function well or at all. That being said it is a lot easier to get at least a rough shave with it than it is to do with a regular razor. If you wish to avoid bloodshed down below you are going to have to take your time.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My wife used this product and these are basically her thoughts. I played around with it on myself too, outside of the \\&quot;bikini zone\\&quot; though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit comes with an AA battery, which is necessary for use. The unit seems sturdy and decently made, and it comes with a bag for easy carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the shaving experience, it is decent. The trimmer attachment with length-guide worked well for her. The hair had to be decently long for the length-guide to work. The trimmer alone worked well, with a few pulls. While some reviews have stated that it pulls all the time, her experience was only an occasional pull, which didn&#x27;t really bother her. The fact that the head is pretty small meant the process took a while, but the small head is necessary because of the size of the bikini line. The exfoliation attachment is a nice addition, because it gets rid of dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback for her was that the foil shaver attachment didn&#x27;t work at all while wet. And it barely seemed to work while dry. It doesn&#x27;t seem to run across the skin like a blade. If she practically set it directly on the hair, so the hairs get in the holes in the shaver, it kind of worked. So... basically, the foil shaver is pointless. Because the foil shaver doesn&#x27;t work well, you won&#x27;t get a super close shave with this unit, like you would with a wet razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a decent trimmer for the low price, if you know its limitations and don&#x27;t come with expectations of getting an experience identical to a wet razor or waxing.</li>
    <li> The directions included with this small groomer are relatively clear.  The included battery really helped my testing because it was testable right out of the box though the battery signs inside the device were not clear so I had to try it a few times to get it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could use it on the most obvious parts of my body and I used it in the shower where it was simply to rinse off.  The empty space at the end of the device isn&#x27;t large enough to really hang in the shower so I&#x27;m not sure what is it is for, it seems pointless.  I wasn&#x27;t worried at all about water getting into the battery because it all snaps closed if you follow the directions. The razor cut off hair quickly, without cuts, and easily with just one pass.  It took perhaps half the time compared to other razors I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is lightweight and easy to use but it has the same problem of any bikini area razor -- basically physical difficulty in seeing everywhere you may wish to trim or shave.  If you have a partner you can trust to help you, my partner found using this very easy, much easier than the previous electric razor, for several reasons -- small head and body allows for easy access to more areas plus you can see around it very well and light weight means it less wear on the wrist and arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box was very difficult to open so don&#x27;t worry about parts falling out in transport to your home.</li>
    <li> This is a very handy multi-use personal trimmer. It comes with a nice matching color pouch that fits everything including all the attachments. The exfoliator is a welcomed attachment that is not available on other trimmer sets. You also get a trimmer, and a foil shaver as well as trimmer guide with adjustable to 4 lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It includes an alkaline Rayovac double A battery. The exfoliator is used everyday in our house but the attachment has a very small surface area compared to what we are using. The trimmer is OK for light use and the shaver is best for maneuvering more smaller places.</li>
    <li> I mostly use the trimmer with the clear guide and without and it works great both ways. The battery life is very good; I&#x27;ve only charged it once and have used it several times for several minutes each time. It&#x27;s easy to remove the head in case you want to use the others. It&#x27;s a little hard to figure out how to put the clear guide on for certain hair lengths, so I had to kind of use trial and error, so it&#x27;s not ideal but it works.</li>
    <li> This shaver is pretty decent as a bikini groomer and allows you to get into tough spots. It can be used both dry and wet if needed, which is nice as it can be potentially used in the shower. It comes with several shaving heads, the narrow design makes it much better for bikini grooming than anything else. It does not snag or hurt like some other bikini groomers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a body shaver it wouldn&#x27;t even get 2 stars! The foil head shaver is not good and can even cause a shaving burn. The exfoliating head is a joke really. that&#x27;s why some reviewers have given it very low ratings. But for the price point I am happy with just the trimming head and for that function only I&#x27;d give it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a decent bikini trimmer, I have used a Philips bikini set and the ever popular Panasonic bikini trimmer before this one and think it&#x27;s performance is comparable to Panasonic but it&#x27;s more ergonomic due to it&#x27;s longer handle. I prefer it to the Philips.</li>
    <li> I bought this for her, but have found that it works better than what I&#x27;d been using for my eyebrows.  A great value @ $10.000.</li>
    <li> ugghhhh.  This has to be one of the worst shavers out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First getting the battery in was a challenge. Maybe I have no strength or something.  I could pop the end off, which was no problem but trying to get it back on was a bit tedious.  And then when I did get the battery in the machine it didn&#x27;t work very well. Truthfully, it didn&#x27;t work at all. I tried the different heads that came with it, but didn&#x27;t see any results. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this. There has to be better products out there.</li>
    <li> Frankly, I am not sure why this device was created. It runs on a single AA battery, so it obviously lacks enough power to do much of anything. I tried it on my legs (which the directions say flat out it can&#x27;t handle) and around the panty line. Even with multiple passes, it doesn&#x27;t really cut well. The size of the head also means the trimming area is not very wide, so many passes over the area are required. The various attachments do not help either. About the only positive aspect about this trimmer is its feminine appearance. It&#x27;s lightweight and it fits nicely in your hand.</li>
    <li> I bought this since my old trimmer was 10$ and this was 17$ I thought hey! It has to be better, since I&#x27;m gicing close to 20, right?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have to take off the guard in order to just GET the hairs. But it left me irritated and well... The regrowth proccess is not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured though, that since I used it wet, maybe I&#x27;lll have a better luck with it being dry?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... This will have to be update.</li>
    <li> it worked just one day</li>
    <li> Works just fine on dry and wet land xD</li>
    <li> This is pretty easy to use... the bikini attachment does a good job with trimming and shaping.  The foil shaver does not do as impressive a job with surface shaving.  I tried it on underarms and bikini line, but preferred the closeness of my disposable razor.  It worked well in the shower, and the hanging hole is quite handy.  The heads are really easy to change, and the battery compartment is easy to use.  It is comfortable in the hand.  I haven&#x27;t really tried the exfoliator, as I don&#x27;t have much need for it.  I&#x27;m not sure I will really use this all the time, but for occasional grooming, it is handy to have.</li>
    <li> Great grooming kit that gets those hard to reach places and is especially great for sensitive skin, much better than similar products on the markets that cause small rashes or shaving bumps for the first day or two after grooming down there.  Definitely an improvement over other kits but could still be better.  All in all, a good grooming kit for those of us with sensitive skin who like to keep things well kept.</li>
    <li> I love this little razor, well, as much as one can really love a razor.  First off, it&#x27;s battery powered and safe to use in the shower.  Second, it&#x27;s very gentle which is great for anyone who deals with foliculitis.  Third, it&#x27;s very easy to change the heads.  I primarily use this as a trimmer, without any guard, for the bikini area.  I don&#x27;t really see a use for the guard unless you have really long hair.  yikes.&lt;br /&gt;I use the foil on my legs and armipits.  I get a decent gentle shave, but nothing like I would get with a handheld razor. The exfoliator is a nice option that I have used just a few times.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a bag so everything can be stored and kept together.  This does everything I expected it to and I have found it to be very handy.</li>
    <li> Love this thing! Eyebrows, face and bikini BOOM! All done with one tool! The battery last forever to!</li>
    <li> Not perfect but works as good as&lt;br /&gt;the others that are more expensive</li>
    <li> I never tried the exfoliating attachment, but all of the other attachments that come with this thing belong in the trash because they just don’t work. Don’t even waste your money.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these at Walmart and figured a shaver&#x27;s a shaver: WRONG. This thing was ok as a trimmer but as somebody else noted, the other attachments don&#x27;t do anything. I overlooked that and kept the trimmer. It worked for about 5 weeks then decided yesterday it didn&#x27;t want to turn on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have returned it after trying the crappy attachments...</li>
    <li> This is the best thing a women could buy for feminine hygiene.  If you are dick and tired of annoying razor bumps, I suggest all women to get a bikini trimmer. I literally, I had no irritation after using this a long my bikini line.</li>
    <li> For approximately  $17.00 the Remington WPG4020 Body and Bikini Grooming Kit is okay for the price and for traveling. Since it works on one AA battery (also included), I would not recommend using it in the shower. The groomer works all right and I liked the exfoliator for soothing my face after using. The mini-shaver did a decent job removing hair. The Pink bag is nice for traveling. A few years back, I bought the Remington rechargeable approximately $20 and it did a good job and came with a travel case. It holds a charge for several weeks and still works today. It&#x27;s now $20. I&#x27;ve tried so many hair removals products over the years and find that a good razor and soap does the best job for a close shave, yet takes more time. This is for on the go, quick hair removal and works just as good as the more pricey models. It beats waxing any day of the week.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my previous Remington bikini groomer---the one that lasted me 18 years.  First, I am disappointed with the size of the thing. My previous one was small, compact, and could easily &amp;#34;hide&amp;#34; in bathroom cabinet or travel bag. This one is HUGE in comparison. It&#x27;s about twice the size of my previous one.  And, it does a pretty poor job in comparison as well.  Just about every time I use this one, it leaves stragglers. I never feel completely groomed.  Total disappointment.</li>
    <li> Results were not sexy.  This thing is not going to groom your private area well and it could cause some serious damage.  The price point should have been my first clue.  So your start with the trimmer, it kept snagging my hair and at one point cut my skin.  It did not matter the angle, the speed, the freshness of the battery, the trimmer was a disaster in the making.  I should have stopped here, but apparently I like it rough. So I moved onto the foil trimmer.  It did nothing during my first pass, so I tried again with a touch more pressure.  Bad idea, more skin damage.  At this point I gave up and found some antibacterial cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found to work was the Philips Narelco Bodygrommer 7100.  The kicker is it is made for men and there is not product similar marketed to women.  WHY!  I mean we are the ones wearing bikinis and in need of effective ways to remove that hair without getting razor burn that looks like we have chicken pox in a very unfortunate place.  Do not be fooled by the black and chrome, or the fact that you find it in the mens shaving section, it is the perfect bikini area maintenance item.  Bonus, because it is not pink your husband/ boyfriend might use it as well.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product. It did what I wanted it to do.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t cut or nick me at all. Just be careful when using any&lt;br /&gt;razor or trimmer in sensitive areas and it will work fine.&lt;br /&gt;Its not going to give the results of waxing, nothing will, but&lt;br /&gt;it gives a great result for those of us whose skin is to sensitive to&lt;br /&gt;wax. I just got mine and used it for the first time, so If it lasts its&lt;br /&gt;worth every cent.</li>
    <li> 5/5 stars for this little trimmer by Remington. It comes with a pink pouch that you can store the trimmer and the accessories in. It also has 3 different attachments that you can use for multiple purposes when grooming body hair. The product is easy to use and clean. This is my first Remington product, but not my last! 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I refuse to believe that the bikini trimmer can not be opened and cleaned. If you can open your bikini head to clean hair please let me know so that I can know if I have a defective one or not. I had a Conair bikini trimmer that cost $11 and it&#x27;s head opened for cleaning but it doesn&#x27;t seem that this Remington opens. I tried to open it and it comes apart slightly but pulls together fast and catches my fingernail, I don&#x27;t want to break it so I have not put more strength into it. I have been using safety pins to dig the remnant hair clippings out because it&#x27;s just not sanitary to have the build up in there of wet hair ( I shave in the shower). I will hate to have to throw it away just because I can&#x27;t clean the hair out or stand looking at the hair inside the head where I can reach with the safety pin.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it is a good set. It is not as good as a wax, but with the bikini trimmer followed by the foil shaver I am satisfied with the shave for my bikini area and under arms, which lasts about a week before I need to touch it up again. Good value for the money if the bikini trimmer could be opened for cleaning, it would get at least 4 stars by me. Otherwise it is a waste because it may as well be disposable if I can&#x27;t clean the bikini head which I use the most. It seems that I can&#x27;t which is why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Finally found something close to what I was looking for...I have veryyyy sensitive skin and exsema, and get ingrown hairs/irritation easily. The exfoliator is amazing, I use it with a gentle &#x27;scrub&#x27; wash. The trimmee works great and attachment head is good but the different levels are a little weird. If you have crazy long hair maybe it would be useful, but I&#x27;m just fine using the lowest (closet) adjustment for trimmimg. As for the foil shaver thing... never used one... and not sure if I ever will again. I dont see the point to having it, but who knows I could just be weirs.That thing was terrifying and basically ineffective, except I did somehow manage to get a cut of some sort from it. It felt almost like an epilator...not cool. But because it is so great otherwise and I can stop stealing my husban&#x27;s trimmer, I still give this 4 stars, especially for being water proof for shower use.</li>
    <li> Thanks it is good and fits good</li>
    <li> When I first got this product I liked it! I used the trim setting and that worked great every time for my bikini area. The foil attachment is awful and doesn&#x27;t shave, only snags hair! The problem is mine died after quite a few weeks. I figured it was just a glitch or something, so I got another. It died in a much shorter period of time! (2 weeks). Not a problem with batteries or anything.. just stopped working. Waste of money to keep replacing.</li>
    <li> The trimmer comes with a few adapters for different hair lengths/uses. However the main use as a trimmer is the only apparent use I can decipher as useful and in that it is NOT even good at being a body hair trimmer! For female areas it pinches gouges and makes you bleed. Its rough under the arm and does not get close enough and you will lose a layer of skin if you try the trimmer on your legs as it drags and is very rough. I HAVE BOUGHT TWO OF SAME STYLE and one lasted 8 months the second just recently only 4 months and thats using it once a week! BAD design bad quality. Thought the first was a fluke but not after two died on me after leaving their mark as it were.....do not waste your money and time......reccomend the shick quatro trimmer/regular razor combo(battery trimmer on one end and regular blade razor on other...see my review...so far so good)</li>
    <li> This trimmer is supposed to be waterproof. Basically, it was not. The battery area constantly got wet and corroded the battery. I could never get more than 2 uses out of each battery I put in, and eventually it just stopped working. I probably used it no more than 20 times before it died.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this little gadget. The trimmer works well without the guide which is why it gets two stars. Put the guide on and it&#x27;s laughable. the shaver is a joke. It truly cut nothing. I thought I was doing something wrong. read all of the instructions to make sure and it still didn&#x27;t work.  I would  not recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> While the Remington Body and Bikini shaver is convenient, I didn&#x27;t like using it with the guide on it because it was too rough for the area I was using it in.  With the shaving head on it, the shaver worked fine, though not nearly as well as a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a small, soft brush that fits on the shaver to exfoliate, which I use for my face, which is why this relatively inexpensive little device is worth the money.  You can pay ten times as much for an exfoliator that&#x27;s meant to be used for the face, and not have ended up with a handy little raise for emergency shaves, when you don&#x27;t have time for shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device takes one AA battery and mine worked just fine once I popped the battery in.</li>
    <li> I found it on sale for $19.99 &amp; thought I would try it.&lt;br /&gt;It worked just fine, no issues with any attachments nor did I have any battery troubles.  Time will tell. . .</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the bikini grooming option on this shaver/groomer yet, but I have used it on my face for peach fuzz.  It comes with a foil attachment just for that purpose.  It gets really hot, and I only had it on for two or three minutes.  It also isn&#x27;t the best at getting all the little tiny hairs without going over and over the area.  It is really loud, don&#x27;t expect to do it and not wake everyone in the house.  I think that could get a little awkward.  &amp;#34;You woke me up, what are you doing in the bathroom that&#x27;s so loud?&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;Grooming my bikini line and shaving my peach fuzz, if you must know!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> We all know it&#x27;s a jungle out there and controlling the foliage is important, so I had high hopes that Remington would tame the wilderness into a nice manicured suburb.&lt;br /&gt;Everything was fine at first. Wet or dry, like a seasoned guide, the bikini trimmer leveled the forest, leaving only stumps in it&#x27;s wake. But that, unfortunately, was where the journey ended. The foil shaver lacked the finesse of an expert landscaper and was utterly unable to provide me with a lawn worth of Better Homes and Gardens. So I gave up and went back to my cheap, but effective, dime-store razor.&lt;br /&gt;I did try out the exfoliator to brush away any remaining debris, but it is very sensitive. If you apply it with any pressure at all, it stops spinning, making it utterly useless.&lt;br /&gt;If all you are looking for is a coarse leveling of the jungle, this is the tool for you. Just realize you won&#x27;t get any awards for the finished product unless you employ additional landscaping tools.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try the Remington smooth and silky grooming tool, but after initial happiness with the product I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the tool I used the trimmer on dry hair. It worked well and provided a close trim. I attempted to use the foil shaver for a closer shave but did not see any difference. I tried using it on a different section of body hair and again did not notice that it actually removed any hair. The length guard was not useful to me and with my hair provided the same result as using the trimmer alone without the guard. The next time i used the tool I tried using it in the shower and this time used the exfoliator It worked well and the exfoliate tool provided a gentle hair removal without being too abrasive. The bristles were soft and gentle on my skin and did not produce any irritation. The very next time I used the tool, however, it felt as though it was ripping the hair out of my body! I tried using it in the shower, out of the shower, with shaving cream, bath gel, without anything, and each time it hurt terribly so I just gave up. I will continue to use the  exfoliator  but am going to be forced to buy a new product or go back to my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will say, the tool was lightweight and easy to grip and maneuver. The bristle head did not spin particularly fast but seemed adequate. I would not recommend this product to those looking for a body grooming tool</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced the same as some of the other reviewers... I use mine every other day, seems to work fine. It&#x27;s nothing spectacular, but what do you expect for $20?</li>
    <li> It&#x27; so-so. Nothing overwhelmingly good about it and nothing overwhelmingly bad about it.</li>
    <li> I like this product and have used this for over 5 years ( This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve bought in the 5 years of use). It does a good cleanup job but keep in mind it&#x27;s not an epilator or waxing product so it won&#x27;t pull hair out from the shaft. It&#x27;s just your typical little grooming shaver but small and powerful enough to get the bikini area. I love the spinning exfoliator brush it comes with though because it helps fight ingrowns. It&#x27;s not the strongest option out there but it&#x27;s enough for my. I love that it&#x27;s wireless too!</li>
    <li> Good close shave. Been waxing for a while but this is so much easier and painless.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I&#x27;ve had this for about 3 months. It&#x27;s been used 3 times and it no longer works. Didn&#x27;t drop it, it didn&#x27;t get wet, battery is new. It&#x27;s junk!</li>
    <li> I love this razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with several different grooming apparatus, including an exfoliator (very important for me, as I have extremely dry skin). It never catches on my skin or pulls. It&#x27;s a very light machine, and very easy to hold. It even comes with a handy little bag to hold all of the equipment. I have no complaints about this product. It is absolutely my favorite razor. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Absolutely terrible! I would have bleed less had I used a chainsaw.</li>
    <li> It did not meet my expectations at all. It&#x27;s not as efficient as it claims to be, a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I liked the idea of this product.  It&#x27;s small and compact and is able to be used in the shower with no problem.  However, I found the shave heads to be small and the grooming process took a lot longer than it normally does with a simple razor.  While this is a nice idea, I refer to use a razor where I have a bit more control and more to work with.</li>
    <li> The function is excellent. The trim was even and hassle-free. However, I only used it twice over the course of 6 months and it is already broken. I tried changing the batteries, and it won&#x27;t turn on anymore. I left it at home in my closet, so there was no dropping or moving it around.</li>
    <li> I LOVED this while it worked. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve only used it twice, and it no longer works. I&#x27;ve contacted the seller.    1.19.15    The seller did replace the unit free of charge. Very happy about that. I&#x27;ve only used it once though. Hopefully this one will last longer. I will follow up after a few  uses. Rating went from a 2 to a 4 and will go to 5 if I get more than a cpl of uses out of it!</li>
    <li> I love the narrow head of this shaver and the pink body is nice looking. It works well and gives a good clean shave. It comes with several attachments as well as a bag to store it in. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I got this from Walmart.  Too many ends- the foil end doesn&#x27;t work at all, I even tried it on my arm with no luck.  Not sure what kind of exfoliating they expect you to get from that end either, it is a really soft bristle and doesn&#x27;t move quickly.  But I do like this with just the plain end.  Will give a close trim with no bumps or cuts (if you hold it right). I also like that it can be used wet or dry, so I feel comfortable running it under water after use.</li>
    <li> This razer is horrible!!! The description says &amp;#34;smooth shave&amp;#34; that is a total lie. I used this razer then had to go over the area with a disposable razor. This product also scratches you really bad. This was a waste of money and I wish I never bought it!!! If I could I would give this product negative stars!!!</li>
    <li> IT WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every woman should have this! Smooth shaving tip and it doesn&#x27;t hurt. Trust me it is the best.</li>
    <li> not worth one penny. what a piece of junk. this was via the amazon vine program so it did not cost me anything and glad I did not even a pay a cent for it. does absolutely nothing. the other reviews are dead on. I would love to know how this passed the testing phase at the company.</li>
    <li> I waited to post a review.  I wanted to try it out for awhile.  Well girls, it works and doesn&#x27;t hurt.  You can shape, get rid of hair, whatever you choose.  No pain.</li>
    <li> This is the best trimmer I have found. It nearly shaves you without the razor burn. It can also stand to get wet. Other trimmers I have had have grabbed at the skin (never fun) or just didn&#x27;t do a good job. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> it works really well and I was kind of surprised how quiet it was also! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a bikini trimmer</li>
    <li> If you want the top layer of your hmmm.. hmm... peeled off like a carrot this is the tool for you.  I have a million cuts.  First one I thought was my imagination.  Second swipe I nearly fainted after humerous screaming.  It is beyond razor sharp.  Im thinking it was really made for the military or something.  I cant believe how sharp and awful that was.  Seriously.  I got a handy dandy mirror and looked.  Bloody cuts everywhere!!!  Ill be sitting here waiting for my swollen vajaja to calm down.  Good luck ladies.  Dont say you werent warned!!!!!!!!!  Sorry for being so graphic but its the truth!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut well and it cuts into the skin.</li>
    <li> My gf is happy with the product. That makes me happy.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these the other day and I love it! Aside from the foil attachment, everything worked great and was as comfortable as shaving down south can be</li>
    <li> Absolutely does NOT work!!!!! I&#x27;ve tried every angle, every possible way with every head and I was lucky if a few stray hairs came out!!! I am absolutely sickened that a company could produce a product as disgraceful as this one!!!</li>
    <li> Terrible product and waste of money.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for!! Nice and quiet. I don&#x27;t use the screened trimmer head because I have sensitive skin and those don&#x27;t do well with me. The other attachments work great.</li>
    <li> Another product that is a great idea, but is so cheaply made that it only performs mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;I wish some company would get this necessity right.&lt;br /&gt;Conceptually great idea .The size is great. The attachments are good idea. You can shave down with gauge to get stubble, but the foil blade for close to skin smooth, nope. It worked on a few hairs, but miseed a lot in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would of taken way too long to cover the needed bikini lines areas. The hair would of grown back on one side by the time I had finished the other side. One day someone will design this functionally correct. And hopefully will be rechargeable,too. Waste of time an $.</li>
    <li> I really liked the look of this product in Target. It seemed like a good design at a reasonable price. So I get it home and while getting ready to take a shower, I put a battery in it. Nothing! It won&#x27;t even turn on. I tried the battery in the other way, just in case (there is no symbol telling you which end to put in first) but it didn&#x27;t work that way either. The cap seemed to go on fine... but it just refused to turn on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I still have the receipt, and I will be returning it tomorrow. I suppose this is what I get for an impulse buy--if I had researched it online first, I would have known what a terrible product this is.</li>
    <li> This is just okay.  It would work fine for some very basic trimming of an already trimmed area.  Other than that, it&#x27;s not worth much.  The exfoliating feature doesn&#x27;t do anything at all.  You&#x27;d be better off spending a little more money and buying something that will work better than this will.  I didn&#x27;t return mine as I felt weird returning something that had been used for that purpose, but I will definitely not use it again.</li>
    <li> The product does what it says! I am very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Wow, I sure wish I&#x27;d done a little research before picking this up at a big box store a few days ago. The price was great, but the product? Not worth a single penny. I used it after a bath, so the hair-down-there was still damp. It&#x27;s a wet/dry trimmer, so I eagerly started to trim. And trim. And TRIM. The results? NOTHING! How on earth could a trimmer manage to do absolutely nothing??? I even used it on its shortest setting, but no dice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could return it, I would. It&#x27;s a piece of junk. I even cut my finger somehow during the act of futility. Run, do not walk, away from this trimmer!</li>
    <li> I was really afraid to try this based on some of the negative reviews on here, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.  First of all, I&#x27;m a latina with coarse vaginal hair and yes, this was the main reason that I purchased this for. Let me say that every single attachment worked exactly as it was supposed to, even the ones that some people said didn&#x27;t work in the reviews, worked perfectly on me. My favorite attachments were the bikini trimmer and the adjustable length guide. With the adjustable guide, I didn&#x27;t even have to scissor trim first. I wasn&#x27;t interested in a completely shaved look, I just wanted to do a trim and a shape up.  Well, I am very satisfied with the results. Now the real test will be to see if the regrowth comes back without ingrown hairs. I found that it worked both in the shower and completely dry. I would definitely recommend this, and I&#x27;m purchasing this again for each of my daughters.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money! Does not work well</li>
    <li> It is alright Pretty good price.</li>
    <li> Poor quality!&lt;br /&gt;Doesnt take the hairs off and leaves you wondering why would this maker sell it.</li>
