<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am a mixed woman (half black, half white), and my whole life I have always struggled with unruly curly hair. It was always so dry, damaged, and just terrible looking. However, when I bought this product it truly changed my hair! For years I was straightening my hair everyday because I couldn&#x27;t bare the look of it curly. But when I started using this, I spent 6 months not straightening in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use this, it really defines your curls and removes all frizz. I recommend you use this with the oil, because it will give your hair definition and softness. Otherwise if you use this by itself, you will get definition and no frizz, but it won&#x27;t be soft.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my frizzy curls smooth and gives me more of a long wavy look. I have tried everything. This is the best thing I have encountered and will always use.</li>
    <li> i love this product.  My hair is difficult to maintain even short, but this product always works well.  It&#x27;s expensive, but works wonders.</li>
    <li> This product left my hair silky and frizz-free!  I would recommend using it right after you wash your hair and towel dry it.</li>
    <li> A huge disappointment.  I had used the original moroccanoil oil for straightening my hair, and was so impressed that I decided to give this a try for when I wear my hair curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad idea. Completely ineffective.  It feels like paste going on, makes your hair look dull and greasy, and really does not smell good at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed, total waste of money.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product everyday to help maintain curls without frizzing. I got this for her as a christmas gift after the salon she goes to recommended it. I would highly recommend this for anyone with curls who hates frizzing and wants to keep tighter curls!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and I use this to scrunch my hair after shampooing.  It curls up nice with no frizz.  Smells wonderful too!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really notice anything spectacular going on with my hair after using this cream, and the smell is not great, in my opinion anyway. It doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than the $6 stuff I&#x27;d been using from the drugstore. I use it on wet hair, just like they show in the demonstration video on the MoroccanOil website. My hair is curly on humid days, wavy on non-humid days, medium thickness, and tends to frizz. Not going to throw the stuff out, but I&#x27;m a little underwhelmed.</li>
    <li> It helps to make my naturally wavy hair more curly and it also makes my hair a bit more manageable. This is my second bottle and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I have thick, naturally curly/wavy hair that is color treated. I also have A LOT of hair. I have used many hair products before for curly hair and I have never had one yet that&#x27;s made the curl come OUT of my hair! until I used this stuff. What the heck?! I had hopes for this cream after reading all the positive and happy reviews, but sadly, this stuff did nothing for me. It actually left my hair flat, kinky instead of curly, and other places straight? I also used a very minimal amount because I was avoiding the greasy hair look. The smell is also overwhelming. It smells like cheap perfume. I am so disappointed because this stuff is expensive! now I have to package it back up and send it back. Don&#x27;t let all the reviews fool you, your hair will NOT look like the advertisements on the MoroccanOil website. You will not be left with bouncy, hydrated shiny curls. You will be left with limp frizz! One reviewer described her hair looking like a &#x27;bad 80s perm&#x27; after using this. Exactly! my hair ended up looking like I crimped it! not the look I was trying to achieve. If you want a great hair product for curly hair, try DevaCurl for curly hair. Now that stuff really works! I have no clue why I ever strayed, but I will only use DevaCurl from now on.</li>
    <li> I have heavy hair and usually have to use a curl cream that is stiff and crunchy in order to keep my natural curl.  Moraccan is soft and not crunchy but does a great job of enhancing my curls!</li>
    <li> I love moroccan oil products, so when I saw this curl cream I bought it immediately. BEST CHOICE EVER. Not only does this product add shine and softness, It also combats the humidity. I purchased it to use on days I am full curl, however, my boyfriend who has a thick head of dark curls, is OBSESSED and uses it daily. He says it is the best product he has ever put in his hair. I agree! HIs hair benefits from this product far more than my hair does. WORTH TRYING!</li>
    <li> This product leaves naturally curly hair manageable soft and under control.  Better price than the salons and more convenient.  Love it</li>
    <li> By now the phrase \\&quot;curly hair problems\\&quot; has expanded into the American language and even has its own cartoons. It&#x27;s true because there really are problems curly haired girls go through. I am one of these lucky girls.  Throughout the years I have spent my time and money looking to find the product that will, in my words, tame the beast. A year ago I was having no luck that is, until I found Moroccan Oil intense curl cream. This Moroccan Oil product has made my hair more defined, hydrated, full, and manageable than all the other products I have tried.&lt;br /&gt; Moroccan Oil Intense Curl Cream is a hair product made especially for curly hair. Although this is not the only product in this specific hair care line, this is the one that helps curly hair the best. It helps define and hydrate the hair to keep it full and luscious throughout each use for long periods of time. It is sold in select salons and online, and recommended as one of the top hair products by cosmetologists all over.&lt;br /&gt;One of the main problems that most people have with curly hair is frizziness, which is caused by humidity and dryness. Frizziness actually makes a person&#x27;s hair look like she has stuck her finger in an electrical socket. With Moroccan Oil Intense Curl Cream, it rehydrates your hair with a leave in conditioner, vitamins and argon oil. The company has spent money and time to prepare the perfect mixture that gives the hair just the right amount of oils and vitamins that keeps it fresh and full without the greasy and oily look. This will leave one&#x27;s hair with defined curls and nourishment all day long. Giving the impression of full and bouncy hair with little to no frizz. I have been practically wrestling with my hair for years wanting it to stay defined, without using pounds of conditioner, gel and/or mousse. With this curl cream I use half the product I used too, and I worry less about my hair throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt; Comparing this product to others, I rate Moroccan Oil as one of the top curl controllers in hair care. The only downfall is price. Moroccan Oil Intense Curl Cream is expensive per bottle, so when competition is biting at the heels, price would be a huge factor in sales.  Even though this product is expensive it has all the traits that Treseme, Bed Head, and Aussie have put together. Therefore, when using smaller amounts of product when styling the bottle tends to last longer than store bought brands. Inexpensive brands don&#x27;t always keep your hair moisturized and defined all day long. Instead around that mid afternoon time, hair starts to frizz out and loose its texture. Going the cheap route does not mean it has the same quality, even if it says on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt; I have not tried all hair care products out on the market, but a good majority of them such as Treseme, Aussie, and Pantene. As of right now this is the best that I have found, and I recommend this to anyone having frizzy, dry, and out of control curly hair.</li>
    <li> I know that argan oil is pricey, but what mostly comprises this product is water, mineral oil, petrolatum, and dimethicone. Common hair products that are found in many other hair products for styling curls will contain similar and do similar. Argan oil is hardly the main player here. Nevertheless, this is priced really high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it has that lovely Moroccan Oil scent and it does do a very nice job of giving form to natural curls without adding sticky-stiffness, like some other \\&quot;curly hair\\&quot; products I&#x27;ve tried. My hair normally is VERY VERY curly and tends to frizz, so I need stuff to tame it. I experimented (semi-successfully) with various products, and in the end, I just end up blowdrying it straight, cause i hate the tangle of curls after a few days. But when I want to go curly (cause my hubby loves my curls), lately I&#x27;ve tried this cream with the argan oil for polishing. It works okay. My curls are better defined without a &#x27;tacky-sticky&#x27; feel, and there is softness...and that lovely scent I&#x27;m addicted to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a useful, good product, pleasant even, but be careful of quantity. Too little and you won&#x27;t get good formation of curls and control of frizz. Too much and your hair will look dirty. Find your own balance and you will see good results. Frankly, it&#x27;s the price that&#x27;s indecent and made me take off stars.</li>
    <li> This item is great for people w curly unruly hair. I have fine curly hair, just a lot of it - so sometimes products for curly thick (the folicle itself) do not give achieve the results I want for my hair.  The great thing is you only need a couple of pumps (too much can make your hair kind of hard - as if you were using a gel) and give you super defined curls w/o using gels, hairsprays, individually twisting your curls, etc... It just gives you what you hope nature intended your hair to look like, w/o looking like you have a product in your hair - It has a nice mild smell and gives you soft and bouncy curls - I use it to style and comb my hair (when wet) and then finish with a bit of MoroccanOil and have hair that looks great all day long</li>
    <li> thought i had ordered the oil,but like the cream just as well. i find israel produces high quality personal products-be it for hair, face or body.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great Product. I have a curl Hair. Do not leave hair oily. The hair is loose, with brightness, silky. So I recommend this product</li>
    <li> I starting using this oil when I colored my hair at the recommendation of my hairdresser because my hair sometimes felt limp and lifeless.  I still use it now that I&#x27;ve let my gray grow out.  It makes my hair feel and smell great.  I found that I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day; I just spread some Curl Cream on my hands and scrunch it through my hair and it works out the \\&quot;bedhead\\&quot; look.  I don&#x27;t have super curly hair; in fact, when I wash it, it looks straight.  My hairdress is the one who showed me, using the Curl Cream, that my hair is actually naturally curly..not just wavy.  I love it and use it nearly every day.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It smells good and helps my curls firm perfectly!</li>
    <li> I like this curl cream until I bought Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Hydrocream. I have thick coarse curly hair and I can leave it curly or do straight with that stuff.</li>
    <li> The pump doesn&#x27;t pump!</li>
    <li> When I received this, the pump was broken which was unfortunate. However, I love this product for my extremely curly hair. Don&#x27;t use too much or your hair looks greasy.</li>
    <li> So far I am LOVING this product!!!!  My hair is super dry, frizzy, and curly. I will try ANYTHING to tame my hair!  I love the smell, it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a year - I LOVE IT - for my short hair, it works.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have tried several other curly serums, frizz stuff but this product is by far the best. I have very thick curly hair and this product not only smells good but also is non-greasy and lightweight. It is a thick, pinkish in color cream. I apply about 2 pumps of the cream into my hand and work it through my wet hair after a shower. I am a wash n&#x27; go type person so I needed to make sure the product worked- and it does! But make sure you wash your hair after 2 days or else it&#x27;ll build up (if you apply everyday) and your hair starts to look greasy.   Once my hair is dry my curls are defined and are not frizzy! My hair stays soft and has a nice bounce. I would recommend it- well worth it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. 2nd bottle.  Lasts almost a year. It helps my curls be smooth and not frizzy.</li>
    <li> I was dissapointed with this product.  I expected it to smell like the oil (which I LOVE), but it doesn&#x27;t.  The cream will give you waves, and it does help keep them from frizzing as much, but be careful not to use too much or your hair feels greasy.  On the plus side, it does not leave your hair feeling stiff or sticky, the bad part is you usually have to add hairspray or some other sticky substance if you want to make it curl and not just wavy.</li>
    <li> Moroccan oil Intense Curl Cream is an excellent product. I love it, my hair is manageable and so soft. it is not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Finally found a product that keeps my waves intact without \\&quot;crunch\\&quot;.  Don&#x27;t need much product and it can be used on wet or dry hair.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Used the product at my hairdressers and thought it was amazing but when used at home just not as good.  Much too expensive to purchase again.  In addition, when pumping, the product did not come out correctly and would be released in clumps or not at all.</li>
    <li> In addition to providing some oil for dry hair, which is essential for my hair, this has a wonderful, clean, scent that I adore. It is not overpowering, that scent. One has to be very close to smell it ... I know because people tell me.</li>
    <li> The vendor was great, the product is as promised and delivered in a timely manner.  It just doesn&#x27;t work as well for my new chemo curls as some other products have.</li>
    <li> This product is okay. I didn&#x27;t notice some huge advantage over other products I have used like Mixed chicks Leave in conditioner but both product seem way over priced.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Not only does it define your curls, it has a light but lovely fragrance</li>
    <li> This stuff was great and probably still is,except that I got a really limp perm so this time around,it&#x27;s not very helpful.It&#x27;s great for great curls,but if you&#x27;re in my situation,don&#x27;t expect it to pump your curls up.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly hair. I used to use a mousse or a curl gel, then I tried a new salon and they used this. My hair looked amazing! No frizz just curls. I use it right out of the shower and then seperate my hair out into curls and leave it. It ends up in beautiful ringlets. This also have a wonderful smell that my husband loves. I got the shampoo and conditioner but they were not worth it. Just get this if you have curly hair and need help with frizz.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really a fan of the Moroccan Oil products. I find that they dry out my hair and don&#x27;t hold my curls. I have very thick hair, but I have other products that work better. It does smell great though!</li>
    <li> Amazing product, defines curls/waves... but smells like baby powder.  I used this a few times, and few and far between, but finally just resold it.</li>
    <li> I first tried this product when visiting in Portland and mistakenly assumed this product left my hair so nice-to-the-touch because the Oregon water was so soft.  Not so.  Using it in my own hometown, I have had the same results -- soft, natural curls.  Too many styling products on the market leave hair stiff and crinkly.  Moroccan Oil Intense Curl Cream is well worth the cost.  Be advised that only a dime-size amount is necessary to great results.[[ASIN:B002CMLS46 MoroccanOil Intense Curl Cream, 10.2-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair, especially in the humid summers.  I use a heavy leave-in conditioner when I wash my hair, but need something lighter to tidy up my curls on the days I don&#x27;t wash.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of products, all of which left my hair sticky or crunchy.  I was given a 4 oz sample of this Moroccan Oil Intense Curl Cream and was initially sceptical, but tried it.  Smooth and SOFT curls, with a lovely fragrance... wow!  When I ran out I shopped around, tried a number of other (cheaper) products, and finally came back here today to buy this.  It may not work so well for everyone, but for me it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have thick naturally curly hair. I think the smell is too strong &amp; more age appropriate for someone older but finding a product that has everything good/ideal has been impossible. Quite expensive so if you can get a deal then it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I heard so much about Moroccan Oil and I wanted to give this a try  The price is high but you don&#x27;t use very much so the value is ok.  there are just other product on the market that are better</li>
    <li> I have curly/wavy hair and love using traditional Moroccan Oil on my hair. Though this product doesn&#x27;t have the traditional scent of Moroccan Oil products, it still smells good. This curl cream lets my hair stay beautiful and bouncy throughout the day - I don&#x27;t have to worry about a frizzy mess.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle and I swear by morrocanoil products. I have wavy/curly hair and my type of hair gets very very very dry, I used mouse before and that made my dryness even worse, with this product my hair has changed so much. The only this is that the product was not from a store, it had a sticker that said it was for promotional use by professionals and that was not specified before purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in Puerto Rico home of hurricanes and humidity.  I have long curly frizzy hair that can dry fluff out to 12-18\\&quot; around my head.  My husband and children have been able to locate me in any size crowd whether we&#x27;re at Disneyland or the World&#x27;s Fair. (I have a lot of hair!)    I use the product as directed, but generously after washing my hair.  I then either blow dry or let it air dry depending on my time constraints.  When completely dry, I use a slim curling iron that gets to 400 + degrees to straighten and curl the ends. The effect is great.  Makes my hair long and lustrous.      I have tried many products from many different curly hair websites, but this is the best for me.</li>
    <li> Great!  Makes my wavy hair into curls when I keep scrunching it.  Make sure you add a little at a time.  Too much weighs down hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lifelong battle of the frizzies. This is the most expensive product I&#x27;ve ever used...and aside from the wonderful smell...it&#x27;s no different than a .97 cent bottle of cheap hair cream.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money!  It&#x27;s thick and leaves a residue. It doesn&#x27;t take very much product. If you use too much it makes your hair feel sticky.</li>
    <li> Great for my fine hair - Keeps the frizzes away</li>
    <li> Very strong repellent smell. makes your hair reek of product for hours.</li>
    <li> Curls curls curls. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t give me the results I expected. I used it along with the oil. However the oil is a good product, it definetly made my hair softer. I usually use and love Kinky Curly Custard and wanted to try something else. After applying the Curl Cream i knew immediately the results were going to be different.The curl cream didn&#x27;t help activate my curls, its was moisterized but dry,smelled great but it looked frizzy and huge of course. Honestly I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product for extremly frizzy unless you don&#x27;t mind puffy hair. If you have soft and thin hair this product might work best for you. Hoped this helped :)</li>
    <li> I love this product my very good friend who is a hairstylist recommended this to me and I have loved it. It&#x27;s a great product. I have always had naturally curly hair and frizzy when I have dried to round brush it straight. With 1-2 pumps my hair is silky smooth! The smell also is very nice! I always hated stinky hair products and this one I do not mind at all smelling. It has been a wonderful product for me so far.  I&#x27;ve had it now for about 2 weeks now.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday.  I have full body hair with natural curl.  Since using this product and getting a new hairstyle I continue to get compliments about my hair even 1 year after the change.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a hair stylist to style curly hair. It works very well and does not leave a greasy look or feel.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product because I have curly hair and wanted a product that would make my curls more defined and less frizzy, this product did the exact opposite. My hair turned into a frizzy mess. I am so disappointed.</li>
    <li> Best product for making curles. I&#x27;m Very satisfied</li>
    <li> Used a different type of Moroccan Oil product but went with this one because it seemed targeted to people with curly hair.  It leaves hair dry.  Disappointed that the pump didn&#x27;t work but made do with switching the pump from an old container cause didn&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle of a return.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair that can sometimes get very frizzy and look disastrous! Very few products show lasting results, but this is one of them. MoroccanOil makes my hair looks less frizzy and feels softer to the touch. This definitely helps tame my mane!</li>
    <li> I have only used this product one time since I purchased it.  I purchased it specifically for a special occasion where I would have my hair down.  I have tight curly hair gets very big and frizzy as it dries.  The product did define the curls and they did not frizz after they dried.  I have not used it regularly because I usually keep my hair pulled back in a twist.  I am satisfied with the product, but I prefer to use the Moroccanoil oil for daily use.</li>
    <li> This product is NOT for fine curly hair.  I just had a straight (weighted down) greasy mess, no matter how little I used.  Something in it (possibly the mineral oil) caused me to break out terribly as well. Pretty expensive disappointment here. Better luck to everyone else.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product to enhance curls in hair that is slightly curly and wavy. Gives nice body and volume.</li>
    <li> I have medium-thick, wavy hair that is very sensitive to any chemicals, sun and heating products.  My hair gets damaged very easily, it only takes a week of using the wrong product to define my natural waves and my hair will be dried out and frizzy.  This product is different, I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and the first week I did not see a significant result...it was still dried out and bit frizzy from my other products.  But this week I am seeing a difference, it&#x27;s shiny, soft and a lot less frizzy.  I&#x27;ve been shampooing/conditioning my hair and then applying a little bit of the product and letting my hair dry.  I have been pretty happy with the results.  I have also purchased the Moroccan Oil and are applying to my ends in the evening before going to sleep.  Although not every product is right for every hair type.  This one works for me</li>
    <li> Bought this cream at my beauty salon, after being recommended by my hair stylish. I have to admit I first thought it was kinda expensive, however this product is sure worth the price. Yes it may be expensive but it last forever since you only need to use a small amount of product; my hair looks fantastic, bright, shiny and not frizzy at all. Not sticky, my curls look fantastic.  I will never use a different product for my curls. I LOVE IT!!! Thanks Moroccanoil!!!</li>
    <li> Love the product but pump doesnt work so dissppointed in supplier</li>
    <li> This smelled nothing like the product my hair dresser used on me in the salon. I threw it out without using.</li>
    <li> This product leaves your hair feeling dry and smells like baby powder for some reason.</li>
    <li> I have had such trouble finding a product for my wavy/curly hair.  I have tried everything, and while some products worked fine, Moroccan Oil is the best. It works in all climates, which is great for me since I travel a lot.  I live mostly in a humid costal climate, and my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz ar fall flat since I started using this product.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I love the Moroccan oil curl cream!  Smells great and leaves my curls soft but does not weigh them down.</li>
    <li> I have the oil and I love it mainly bc of the scent and the softness I am left with.  I recently ordered the curl intensifier and I am very disappointed in the scent. I got it  from an online beauty store and I almost feel as if I got tricked bc the product doesn&#x27;t  smell anything like the oil.  I may try going to a salon and just smelling the product   to see if I have been dupped.  I will say the it hasn&#x27;t tackled the frizz like other   products so I won&#x27;t be buying this again unless I find out I was suckered into a fake  product.</li>
    <li> used this only a couple of times since purchasing. I Ptrfer other products.</li>
    <li> The oil and curl cream absorb right away and leave the hair looking shiny. The only problem is you have to use more than the bottle says, and it is pretty pricey for a hair product.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because I&#x27;ve seen it advertised in Harpers Bazaar and thought it would be good...real dissappointment!  I&#x27;ll just stay with my Biolage.  This Moroccan Oil curl cream was really expensive, didn&#x27;t have the great smell like others have mentioned, and just plain didn&#x27;t work as well, and I have very curly hair, so it&#x27;s not like it takes a lot to hold my curl.  I was just looking for something new and different that may hold my curl without leaving that \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; feel, and would look natural.  I&#x27;ve found that a little Silk Therapy and using Biolage products works best...</li>
    <li> I recenlty had a keratin hair treatment which smoothed and relaxed my hair to a fairly straight style. On days when I want a bit more body and bounce, I add this to my style products and love the outcome.  A great way to change my style with little or no fuss.</li>
    <li> I am ethnically mixed and have trouble finding products to handle all the different textures of my hair.  My hair is light in color (coppery red) with varied textures throughout, and quite thick with moderately tight curls.  So far, this product has given me the best curl/frizz control without feeling too heavy or leaving my hair looking like a wet terrier.  Holds even in extreme tornado-weather humidity.  However, it is quite expensive for the amount of product you receive.  I&#x27;m still looking for a healthier, less expensive alternative.  Tried Mixed Chicks with moderate success, BioSilk with moderate success, on to DevaCurl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not for followers of CurlyGirl, as this product is full of parabens and alcohols.</li>
    <li> This product is great, and I found it here at a much better price compared to a hair salon. It shipped quickly too.</li>
    <li> I love Moroccan oil, but the reasons why I gave it three stars are as follow:    1- It&#x27;s expensive comparing to similar products  2- You can&#x27;t find it in any stores, you have to order it online  3- It has strong smell and I don&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> I have been searching for the perfect curl cream for most of my 33 year lifespan and I believe I have found it in this product! I have a lot of fine naturally curly hair and this cream is great. Keep in mind, however, that a little goes a LONG way! For example, my hair is down past the middle of my back and I use approximately 2 teaspoons.  I apply it when my hair is wet, right out of the shower, and then just scrunch with a towel and that is all the product I need! It is a little costly, but this bottle lasts me about 4 months.</li>
    <li> Love..love...LOVE this product. Makes your curls soft and bouncy and not crunchy. I will say it took a couple weeks for the product to really take and create amazing curls. Could be because this was a very different type of hair product than the mousses or hair gels I used to use.</li>
    <li> This product is great for curly hair it brings out the natural curl.  It does not control the frizz but there are other products to help with that.</li>
    <li> I use this product every time I wash my hair....there is no need for conditioner. It makes my curls really manageable.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for anyone with curly, wavy, or frizzy hair, it works wonders!! my hair is like all three and its AMAZING! my hair is soo shiny and there is no frizz at all! My waves look gorgeous :) and it has a great hold but it doesnt weigh your hair down or anything! Its soo touchable and beautiful!! A MUST-HAVE!! :) :) :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, it really works wonders on my curly hair.  It smells amazing and keeps the curls intact without being too heavy--how does it do that?  I get out of the shower, scrunch 2 pumps through my hair, air dry, and I&#x27;m good to go.  It doesn&#x27;t get better than this!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s necessary for me to preface this review by saying that this might very well NOT be a genuine MoroccanOil product (and I will review the retailer to reflect this) but if I am going on the assumption that I was actually shipped the product that I ordered, as it is shown here, then it&#x27;s a really terrible product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so thick that it&#x27;s difficult to apply it evenly (even on wet hair) and it dries with a gross texture, isn&#x27;t moisturizing at all, and smells really terrible. (I love the smell of MorrocanOil products generally.) I have long, thick, coarse hair that is fairly curly and using this product is worse than using no product at all. As an alternative, I HIGHLY recommend Kenra Curl Defining Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: I am just realizing that Amazon is the retailer. I trust Amazon and buy directly from Amazon whenever possible but, for this product, I would question their distributor.</li>
    <li> Big fan of this product.  I have been using for about 2 years, keeps hair frizz free and soft.</li>
    <li> Excellent product . Service was super.</li>
    <li> No more frizz - just lustrous, soft curls! This product seems expensive, but goes a long way. Keeps hair healthy and able to avoid flat irons.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t purchase through the internet too many counterfeits. My wife uses this chemical concoction to help tame those beastly curls. Works for her.</li>
    <li> I have fine, curly hair that wilts when there&#x27;s too much &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; on it. A dab of this eliminates the need for conditioner in the shower, and makes my hair curl enthusiastically. Many have complimented me on how shiny my hair is (rare in gray hair), and it helps tame the frizz.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 years +. I love it! It conditions, controls, and styles all in one. I introduced it to my sister in UK and she has also become a fan.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot.  It smells wonderful, leaves my hair smooth and with defined curls.  The trick is using the right amount for your type hair.  My hair is fine, so I need only about 1/4-1/2 teaspoon rubbed into palms and distributed throughout my hair.  I let it air dry, so I can&#x27;t address how a dryer affects the result.  I&#x27;m very pleased with how it works for me.</li>
    <li> This is my all in one curly girl product! I co-wash, then put some in my hair after I&#x27;ve run my fingers through. Then I twirl (I&#x27;m a twirly girl rather than a scrunching girl) sections of my hair, then let it air dry &amp; I get long lovely curls. Since I live in a very humid climate if it&#x27;s going to be super humid I&#x27;ll scrunch a tiny bit of mousse in afterwards. No more frizz! Love my hair with this! I&#x27;ve gone 2 or 3 days without having to do anything else. Amazing!</li>
    <li> product is ok but the pump dose not work.  When you spend $30 on a product you expect a little bit more than what i received.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried different products for my real tight frizzy curls and this is the best. Its a little pricey but you will not find anything like it. Just add a little bit to your damp or dry hair and it works great. You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I.have been using for many years. My hair is thick, and using this product leaves my hair soft and curly. Best hair cream for me!</li>
    <li> I like this product but it is VERY strong; not much is needed.  I have super thick wavy hair and just a bit really does a lot; it&#x27;s easy to use too much and look greasy.  It does make my hair totally soft though and retain moisture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly the smell isn&#x27;t like the aerosol products (which is my favorite smelling hair stuff ever.)</li>
    <li> I have used this product before.  Curly hair is unruly and changes daily.  This stuff seems to make it look the best, considering what you are working with.  I received the product I thought I was purchasing and I received it in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I would recoment to evertbody.actually my wife bought it n she is not here for a month so she approves the product r I be hearing a complaint.</li>
    <li> Best product out there for curly hair. Not gelly. Doens&#x27;t make hair hard/crusty. Stays smooth/controlled. Also - shipped right on time</li>
    <li> My hair has never felt so soft and bouncy since I started using this product. I love the stuff. The only thing that took away from it was that part of the label on the front of the bottle had been cut away, making me question the integrity of the contents. This is my second bottle so I haven&#x27;t started using from this bottle. It looks and smells legit. This did not come from Amazon; it came from an outside seller.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Received on time!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and live in an area where my hair gets really freeze. This product works great in keeping my curls really nice and curly with volume. It is easier to maintain my curls too!</li>
    <li> The best curl cream that I&#x27;ve used since going natural.  My hair is soft and not brittle after using it.</li>
    <li> I went through an entire bottle of this stuff trying to make it work, and it was just not worth it.  The price in itself is too much for a product that you have to combine with several other products in order to get a great result.  If I didn&#x27;t use enough, my hair was still frizzy.  If I used enough, my hair was too heavy and my curls sagged.  Just not worth it.  I&#x27;ve also tried to moroccan oil serum.  I&#x27;ve gotten better results from an $8 bottle of serum.  This brand is over hyped and over priced.</li>
    <li> It gave me the softness and curl I was looking for after using it consistently for over 10 days. I like that it was somewhat odorless also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too impressed. I like using the original oil better. This cream is very thick and only takes a tiny bit, but I find it hard to work evenly through my hair (much like the shampoo - if you&#x27;ve ever used it, I&#x27;m sure you know what I&#x27;m talking about). But beware, if you use too much, your hair will look really greasy.</li>
    <li> I have wild &amp;#34;gypsy&amp;#34; hair - dry, thick with a mind of its own. The smallest dab of this in my hair after washing (and still wet) calms everything right down. It smells wonderful, not heavy or greasy and let the curl come through naturally. And it does take the littlest bit, so this bottle goes a LONG way. I don&#x27;t know what I did without it!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and this product adds moisture and control to my curls! Can&#x27;t believe how manageable my hair is without being stiff or too oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review for a beauty product before, but I had to say how impressed I was with this cream. I&#x27;ve used the MorocanOil for several years and it did wonders when I wore my hair straight. I live in a dry climate with that doesn&#x27;t enhance my curly hair the way CA did. There&#x27;s very little humidity here, so I have an easy time drying my hair straight with boar bristle brushes. However, it&#x27;s faster to get ready when I let my hair go curly. I was skeptical about this product just because I know how easy it is to end up with dirty looking hair with any botanical or natural oils. However, this worked amazing!! I&#x27;ve never had my hair curly and yet so soft. It&#x27;s way above the other brand name gels and mousses I was using. The next morning my hair was still curly/wavy but not the way it was the day before. The best part is though, my hair was super soft and didn&#x27;t get tangled in th shower when I washed it. That was a first for me. Usually I have to be very careful when I&#x27;m washing my hair after having gel in it because it tangles like crazy after I get out of the shower. This did not have that problem at all. I&#x27;m super having with the product, I just hope my first usage wasn&#x27;t a fluke!</li>
    <li> I put this on when my hair is still soak and wet. I don&#x27;t towel dry may hair since it is naturally curly and I don&#x27;t want to make it frizzy. Love the way my hair smells.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time. The bottle was not filled completely and the color of the cream was different than my previous bottle. I will purchase in person next time.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Smell is no so good, but after using ir my hair is soft, shinny and curls are domesticated</li>
    <li> By far the best product for curly hair I am so glad I purchased this. No frizz and hair looks amazing</li>
    <li> It is amazing!!!  I don&#x27;t like to flat iron my hair all the time.  I sometimes like to do something easy with it since I have long and wavy hair.  I use this product on my hair when it is still damp, press the curls with my hands and let it air dry.  It feels very soft and looks shiny.  I ask my daughter to allow me to apply it on her long hair too and she was amazed by it.  It is a great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s possible the bottle is old, but nothing will come out using the pump, I need to unscrew the bottle cap every time I want to use the products and it feels rather thick.</li>
    <li> I have used this product with the oil hair treatment, I mix both, don&#x27;t need too much, it lasts a long time. It makes my curls soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Impressive anti-oxidants and intensive hydration capabilities, this breakthrough styling product is used to enhance and define curly hair.  Curly Curly</li>
    <li> I have annoying hair that half of it is curly and half of it is straight. THis is great stuff since it helps that half that is straight be curly when I want it to be. The bottle lasts a long time. I love just being able to put a squirt of this in and a dob of gel and be ready for the day.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this Moroccanoil Intense Curl Cream.  I have type 3a curly hair that is fine.  Caution: a little bit goes a long way.  I can tell it is moisturizing, my hair feels extremely soft and appears very shiny when I use it.  This just isn&#x27;t meant for fine hair and/or curly hair that needs help with defining curls.  It weighs down my hair, and makes my hair appear less curly and more wavy with no body or volume.  It smells great though!</li>
    <li> It does nothing. It was a waste of money. It was also heavy which would not help in keeping curl. It left my hair coated to where the next day I couldn&#x27;t stand it and got up and washed it off. Thats not good.</li>
    <li> I first bought this item from my hairstylist who recommended I try.  This leaves no crunchy feel and you do not have to worry about it drying out your hair.  Like all of the MoroccanOil products the smell is wonderful!  I run through my hair and let my hair dry naturally and it leaves my curly hair soft yet shows curl definition.  Well worth the money!  This is the best hair cream for curly hair that I have ever found.</li>
    <li> When my hair stylist pulled this product out for use on my very fine, very damaged, very frizzy, slightly wavy hair, I was quite surprised.  While my hair has definite waves (that does form some actual curls if allowed to full air dry without brushing), I wouldn&#x27;t consider my hair &amp;#34;curly,&amp;#34; and the label of this product clearly reads, &#x27;For Curly Hair.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the stylist applied this cream, and then used a diffuser to gently dry my hair, while using only her fingers to separate my hair, I saw how fabulous this product is.  My waves never looked better, my frizz was almost non-existent, and my hair was shiny.  It was amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is not too thick or sticky, so it works on hair that is fine and/or only wavy.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair too much, nor does it leave the hair with that &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look that some curl enhancers do.  Instead, it lightly coats the hair and leaves it soft, controlled, and pretty.  It doesn&#x27;t leave hair looking overly styled at all (which is a good thing, in my not-so-humble opinion!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing how fabulous this product was in the salon, I bought a bottle for home.  It works well there, too, but without the top-of-the-line blowdryers and the professional expertise, I cannot get my hair to look as great as it did in the salon.  It still looks good, though, when I use the MoroccanOil Curl Cream!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Have been using it for months and will not use anything else. My hair has never felt better. Soft and smooth. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for my extremely curly hair. Can&#x27;t say enough about how well it softens, moisturizes, and relaxes my curls.  Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> this is my second container to order.  I have dry, course, wavy to curly hair (the very curly area caused by medication, and it appears to be permanent, but that&#x27;s okay.  This probuct was first used on my hair in the hair salon when they saw that my hair needed help.  I now wash my hair at home...very long, and I just wring out excess water, use a few pumps in palm of hand, warm it up a but in hand and run it through my hair to make the hair softer with the curls, courseness, and moisture.  The smell is wonderful.  You will think that you are on a tropical island.  Because I  have trouble letting my hair dry naturally right now in cold weather, I  rewrap with towel and let product rest within hair a few minutes before I dry it and set it.  It lasts a very long time!</li>
    <li> I bought this product on the recommendation of a friend.  She uses it to enhance her naturally wavy hair. I tried it but it really didn&#x27;t make my hair look that great.  But in trying it, I learned that it did condition my hair.  I use WEN products to wash/condition my hair every other day.  On the off days, I use a tiny drop of Moroccan Oil on the bottom half of my hair, work it thru very well and wow!  Great soft, shiny and silky hair.  So I gave this product 4 stars because it does not work as intended for me, but the conditioning is worth the price!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  It&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my hair from frizzing out.  I recommend this product highly.  I love the scent as well.</li>
    <li> My picky husband...I mean my darling husband loves this stuff.  It doesn&#x27;t smell, isn&#x27;t greasy and it&#x27;s very effective.  I use it too.. and I wear my hair straight...but I find that it makes my hair glossy.  It is expensive, but you use very little and it lasts quite a long time so I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am loving this leave in cream. The fragrance is like some really awesome incense and it does exactly what it says. Pumps up the curls, cuts the frizz..and it doesn&#x27;t bog the hair down. Often times I&#x27;ve used products and my hair looks horribly wet all the time. Not with this stuff. My hair looks normal, but curly!!  And did I mention that I LOVE the fragrance?</li>
    <li> One of my favorite to go curling products. Smells and works great! I have long thick, wavy to curly hair and it gives my curls nice definition and shine.</li>
    <li> I use this for a looser curl and it works well. I like Moroccan Oil products and this is a solid one.  It hasn&#x27;t been life changing and I haven&#x27;t used it alone to really see what it does but it works well with the David Babaii Bohemian Beach Spray for nice loose curl.</li>
    <li> This styling cream is everything I&#x27;ve been looking for.  Gels usually leave my curls crunchy and dry, and most creams just don&#x27;t define my curls.  But Moroccan Oil curl cream gives me really pretty definition, at the same time giving my hair shine and softness.  I use the Moroccon Oil leave-in first, then the curl cream.  I haven&#x27;t loved my hair this much in years!  It is pricey but well worth it.  I used to use Biosilk products, but over the years Biosilk&#x27;s quality has gone downhill, and to me it smells mostly like alcohol now.  Moroccan Oil smells delicious... another plus :)</li>
    <li> ok.. I have been trying many curl cream and lotions for a while in the search for the one that defines your curls without causing frizz, afro, oily, hair loss because it is heavy, and curls that last for a day.. so I tried many products and this is one of them    Pros  - does not have the sticky feeling of so may others like \\&quot;bed head, Oreal..\\&quot;  - keeps hair shiny and soft    Cons  - use it alone after shower, hair did not curl, it gave me a puffy wavy hair, not curly.. smooth and not sticky  -used \\&quot;coconut organix split end mender before\\&quot; and little of this, got curls.. but flattened out by end of day  -if you put more of it.. hair becomes oily and greasy    so far, I like the Sephora \\&quot;living proof no frizz\\&quot;, the curls hold for the day and still use the coconut organix cream before some times to tame it..    the next product to try is the bumble and bumble curl defining one.. will see</li>
    <li> This really helps soften and define my natural wavy hair.  I love the scent and the feel.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this from my barber, but he ran out. So, I got it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I like this as it is not greasy, keeps my hair moisturized, and smells kinda nice.&lt;br /&gt;It works well on my curly locks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this one star even though I love this product and have used it for many years, I am not happy with the seller as I received the product with a faulty pump, making it so I cannot get the oil out of the bottle. I notified the seller as soon as I discovered this problem, who told me they would take care of it. Heard nothing for a month and now was just told they are unable to help me.</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant about buying this product at first because I am Caucasian with extremely dry and frizzy hair and nothing ever worked! I decided to give it a try and I must say...THIS IS A MIRACLE PRODUCT! IT WORKED BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS! My hair was immediately shiny, frizz free, curly, and best of all...LASTED ALL DAY! This is the only product that has given me the results I have looking for in years! It is pricey but it is 100% worth it! Try it and you will not be disappointed! I will be using this forever from now, so glad I bought it!!</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally curly but does become frizzy without this cream.  I have been using this cream for about 3 years and I love it.  Just use small amount, (dime size for long hair) working it in from ends to scalp. Does not weigh hair down. Use sparingly!! For me this size lasts 6-8 months.  Highly recommend for curly heads!!!</li>
    <li> did not like at all, hair feel dry and loose shinning</li>
    <li> This product was originally recommended by my salon to put body and curl in my hair. It was time to reploace, so I ordered it on line.</li>
    <li> Great for thick hair. Recommend: Lightly spray hair with water then massage a small amount of this product to get the best result.</li>
    <li> love this stuff. my hair is growing so much more by using it</li>
    <li> Bought this after reading several great reviews. Maybe it&#x27;s just how difficult my hair is, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again. Too thick and leaves my hair feeling sticky. It makes my hair more voluminous instead of holding my natural curl. Could be a better product.</li>
    <li> My beautician used this product on my hair and I love it.  My hair is very soft and curly.  During the humid weather it gets real frizzy.  What I love about this product the most is it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair stiff, like some other products I have tried.  My hair looks great and is nice and soft.  I would recommend this product.  I also use the oil.  Wonderful product. 20 stars!</li>
    <li> I actually liked the lighter version of this product better. This one is a bit heavier and greasier for my type of hair. However, I do love the quality of Moroccan oil products. It is amazing and I am totally hooked. I have relatively wavy hair but not coarse and these products bring amazing frizz control to my hair unlike any product out there. In order to make this product lighter I  add a bit of water when applying to my damp hair and it works well.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this on me several times and I fell in love with it then.  I have naturally curly hair so this is a great product for that!  Leaves it soft, silky, smooth but with good curl.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of good reviews about this hair creme and that&#x27;s why I bought it. First off, saying it smells good is wishful thinking. This stuff smells pretty bad. However, it does hold my curls pretty well and does decently containing the frizz. I&#x27;m biracial and got my dad&#x27;s Cambodian hair, meaning its frizzy, course, and curly, so the fact that it can contain my curls at all is impressive. Still you really have to be careful with the amount you use. Just a little too much and your hair looks greasy and crunchy. Overall, not terrible but pretty expensive for just okay results.</li>
    <li> it makes my hair amazing, absolutely love it.  my hair is really wavy and curly and it just makes it so much more beautiful</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for my curly hair. It leaves it looking beautiful w/o being crunchy. I live in a very humid place and I&#x27;ve finally got my go-to product. It&#x27;s taken me years to find something this good!</li>
    <li> Great for curly hair ! I love it</li>
    <li> Nice product, good for my hair</li>
    <li> very functional and nicer</li>
    <li> I mix this with Moroccanoil Oil and love how hydrated my hair is and how great my curls look&lt;br /&gt;when they are not dry</li>
    <li> Finally found a product that makes my curls feel soft and keeps the frizz out. No flakiness. My hairdresser calls it &amp;#34;curl crack&amp;#34; and she&#x27;s not kidding. This stuff is awesome and I hope to never go without!!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and have been on a mission to find a product that would help control my hair.  This product is great!!!</li>
    <li> Great product - arrived as expected.</li>
    <li> This product was ok.  It left my hair soft but didn&#x27;t do much to activate the curl like other products usually do.  Also, I have some frizz in my hair.  Usually other curl creams manage some frizz and activate curls simultaneously.</li>
    <li> Love this product to tame my curls. It combats frizz very nicely and the bottle lasts quite a while. Fantastic stuff</li>
    <li> I have very oily hair, but the ends get dry from winter and coloring.  I use this every day on the ends and it makes such a positive difference.</li>
    <li> I have tried every product that is supposed to be great for curly hair. This Moroccan Oil  hair line is the best I have ever tried. I have paid for inexpensive products to very expensive products and this is the VERY BEST I have ever tried in my life, and I am in my 50&#x27;s. It makes my hair soft, shiny, bouncy, and easy to manage. My hair is shoulder length. No frizzies or heavyness. I get so many compliments and people just wanting to touch my hair. I am okay with the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I think these products like many are a little overrated. ..I mean using this felt like I was using garner or some treseme cream. It didn&#x27;t do much for me...maybe if the price was lower.</li>
    <li> I love this product -- the feel, the smell, the way it makes your curls feel.   I still need to follow the Morrocan oil (which leaves hair very soft) with a light gel to hold my curls better. It&#x27;s pricey, but you don&#x27;t have to use a lot with each application so a bottle lasts quite a while. I found a number of Amazon sellers offering this product at a better price than I can buy it at local salons, even with shipping!</li>
    <li> I use this stuff on my thick, curly, frizzy hair religiously. A bottle last me about 4-6 months, so it&#x27;s worth it. I have hair down to my mid back.</li>
    <li> If you have thick curly hair there is no better product in the market! The smell is a little &amp;#34;musky&amp;#34; which isn&#x27;t my favorite but the result are worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have curly, wavy hair.  I can apply this to wet hair and blow dry my hair.  Very easy and reliable.</li>
    <li> Makes my curly hair a little frizzy, but it works really great on my friend&#x27;s naturally-curly hair. I like it, regardless of my frizz. A dab of something else to control it a bit does the trick, and my hair stays really soft. The pump is convenient.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that is adversely affected by humidity. This product gave my hair the shine, shape and texture that I wanted. Two thumbs up! I would definitely buy and use this product again.</li>
    <li> A MUST have for curly hair girls like me. This stuff is like magic. Works wonders. Definitely comes highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave hair crunchy or oily</li>
    <li> I was very excited to start using Moroccan Oil Curl Cream based on its many positive reviews. A week into using the product my hair felt and looked 50x healthier, however my skin also started breaking out. I originally thought my new acne was due to the hot summer heat/sunblock but I knew it had to be something else (I had never had such terrible skin since puberty and usually have clear skin). My skin progressively grew worse -particularly on the far sides of my face, even though I was exfoliating constantly and getting facials. I eventually realized that it could be due to the oil and stopped using the product and my skin instantly got better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it undoubtedly made my hair healthier it in no way was worth bad skin. However, I do have friends who use the product and have not had such negative reactions. I would say it depends on skin type and if your hair touches your face often.</li>
    <li> I have natural ethnic hair (very curly and thick, but not course).  I transitioned from braids to a natural style using Moroccan Oil Intense Curl Creme.  I love this product.  My hair stays very hydrated, and I can create a variety of natural styles using the Intense Curl.  I also take my product to my hair stylist.  She also loves the product.  There are no artificial chemicals, and is very safe on natural hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little late with my review, but better than never. Great pricing for this product. It&#x27;s over $30 no matter what store u go into in my area. Therefore, it&#x27;s def worth the online purchase and shipment wait. The shipping was fast by the way. Product is great for curly hair and smells phenomenal. People always compliment me on the smell. I&#x27;ve even had strangers sniff my hair :/</li>
    <li> I have natural curly hair and it worked ok.  It definitely leaves hair soft, which is nice, but didn&#x27;t control the curl much.  All hair is different and I can see it working on some, just didn&#x27;t do well on mine.  I do love it for when I straighten my hair, leaves it soft and shining and not frizzy - can last for days.</li>
    <li> I have used Moroccan Oil for years, and Amazon always has better prices on it than I can get anywhere else.</li>
    <li> love this stuff works awesome</li>
    <li> Love this!!! So glad I found it</li>
    <li> For my naturally curly hair, this is a great product. Use one squirt!</li>
    <li> Amazing for curly hair! Incredible hold, but also not crunchy or greasy. I have tried everything in my hair and this is my favorite curl cream</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase. I have thick, dry, long hair and this product helps hydrate my hair.  I use this product along with Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling Cream.  They work very well together.</li>
    <li> Good product and recived quick, satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have very long, very curly, very dry frizzy hair. I have not found a product that makes my hair soft and not greasy looking or feeling. I have used a variety of products and have not yet found any that gave me such great results as this product has. After only one use my hair was virtually frizz free and super soft. It made my curls look fabulous also! I used it after I had showered and then again the next day (avoiding my scalp, even though it doesnt make my hair seem oily, I have a naturally oily scalp and thus avoid using product on my dry hair) I applied it from around 2 inches from my scalp and it even helped my curls out that had been in a bun all day from work. Yes the price is steep, but you only need a pea sized amount for your entire head, therefore $30 for a product that will last you months is well worth it I feel. Like I said a pea sized amount is all you need, rub it through your hands and you can get all of your hair. I have super thick hair that is past my back and I only use a pea sized amount for all of it. Great product, helped out my dry frizzy hair and made it look and feel healthy. I will most certainly continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> The product itself is perfect, but my case is broken and it&#x27;s impossible to get the cream out without opening it</li>
    <li> Unlike many users I didn&#x27;t like what this product did for my hair. In all fairness I should say that there are very few hair finishing products that I do like. My hair just doesn&#x27;t respond well and tends to look unnatural. I&#x27;ve noticed this appearance in some other people&#x27;s hair, but they seem to be satisfied and that&#x27;s all that counts. I have, by the way, tried using varying amounts and followed the directions. I gave it to my hairdresser who actually recommended it to me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products with Argan oil but this one has just what it takes for my curly, kinky, out of control hair.  After drying my hair with a towel, I apply the indicated amount and just let it air dry.  My hair feels softer and my hair has more curls instead of just frizz.  I can wear my hair short or semi short and still get the results I want.  Since I also have thin hair, the product has just enought weight to keep it from flying but not too much that it looks matted down.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Have naturally curly hair with frizz.  This product works very good with controlling frizz and taming curls. Note: Just a little dab will do and work it through the hair real well.</li>
    <li> This is the next best thing to Davines molding putty.  Put this in my hair after washing and let air dry for a bit then hit it with dryer and my curls look great!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  I apply this product when my hair is towel-dried as directed, then follow up with the MoroccanOil Curl Defining Mousse and my hair looks MUCH MORE healthy and tame.  My natural curl is more a wavey curl, but these two products define the curls and manage everything really well.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love the Moroccan Oil In tense Curl Cream! It leaves my hair curly without the crunch! Silky soft, touchable hair! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Just one &#x27;press&#x27; of the pump is plenty to work through hair and leave it soft and manageable. Curls are easily &#x27;scrunched&#x27;, even the next day with a spray of water if you have dry hair like mine that won&#x27;t tolerate daily shampooing. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> Ok, so I am a hair conscious gay guy.  I have very thick and course wavy/sometimes curly red hair.  This product amplifies my natural wave and curl.  It is not consistent, as weather does change, but after towel drying, I throw a couple squirts in my almost shoulder length hair and rub it in very well.  MUST BE PUT IN AFTER WASHING HAIR.  If you add this product to dry hair, especially dirty hair, it just gets all greasy.  So apply right after showering.  It conditions the hair while also enhancing natural curl.  Lifetime customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRIME shopper</li>
    <li> I bought this product (recommended by my hair dresser) to help tame my very wavy, fine hair.  I live in a high humidity region and my hair tends to frizz and expand on a daily basis.  For me, the intense curl cream works ok by itself, better when mixed with the hydrating cream, but the hydrating cream by itself works best.  May be different for different hair types.</li>
    <li> I returned because it made my fine hair a bit stiff.</li>
    <li> good style for curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;Decrease freezing hair.&lt;br /&gt;I personnaly prefer oily products, difficult for handling.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I recommend this brand to anyone with curly hair. I don&#x27;t put any harsh chemicals into my curls, like mouse and hairspray; they&#x27;re like curly hair suicide. this brand is amazing and this creme is so hydrating. my curls are left revitalized and shiny. love love love</li>
    <li> I got this for my 4 year old.  She has medium length, medium, curly hair, but it&#x27;s also very fine.  We typically don&#x27;t put product in it, since she&#x27;s only 4, but there are occasions where we like to try to make it look a little more tame.  This product was recommended to me from a stylist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general it works great if applied after a hair washing.  We only need to use a tiny bit, probalby size of a dime.  It makes the curls bouncy and light with no frizz.  I also love how the hair isn&#x27;t crunchy or stiff.  Also it smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to people with thin, curly hair. Not sure how it would work on thick curly hair.  It is expensive, but you use so little, the bottle will last quite a long time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite sticky, so the day after you apply it your hair looses all shine, and looks like it hasn&#x27;t been washed in a while. I would also rate the curl hold capacity of this product average. Your curls start to fizz out in a day.</li>
    <li> I have been using MoroccanOil Intense Curl Cream for over a year and I cannot say enough good things about it!  I have a lot of fine, very curly hair and it leaves my curls well defined.  A little of the product goes a long way so, I don&#x27;t mind the price.  A bottle of it lasts me a couple of months.</li>
    <li> I have very curly, somewhat fine hair. This works great and smells fantastic. Quick delivery, well-packaged.</li>
    <li> Work great on my VERY curly and usually dry hair!</li>
    <li> This works great on my curly hair. It is light and doesn&#x27;t make my curls stiff or heavy!  Great product!</li>
    <li> what can I say, it softens, smells great...wonderful product</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in my curls.</li>
    <li> Great product and much less expensive here than at salon.</li>
    <li> nao sei o que dizer. eh muito diferente dos outros produtos da linha. eh muito grosso e deixou o cabelo um pouco oleoso... acho que prefiro usar o oleo apos a lavagem</li>
    <li> The product seems to be okay. However, the pumping function is not working when it shipped. So, whenever I use it, I need to open the top and take the cream out, which makes it quite inconvenient.  I used morrocco oil for several times; and this was the first time I am unhappy with the product.</li>
    <li> This is so good for your hair. My husband loves it and he is very picky. It is especially good for summer when curly hair goes a little crazy. Will buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> Just a little bit of this helps my hair curl without leaving it sticky or crispy. My hair looks and feels shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> Moroccan Oil Curl Cream did not disappoint.  I have cut my hair very close and it tends to be out of sorts.  This curl cream give my hair body, shine and holds curls without being stiff.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have very thick coarse hair!! I call it horse hair! This stuff tames it down makes it shinny and doesn&#x27;t leave a build up!, I can straighten it, curl it  and it looks awesome!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product while on vacation because I forgot my anti-frizz product.  I was told this product was extremely popular and sold out frequently.  I bought the line&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner and was very pleased but the curl cream was truly a 1-star product.  Not only did my hair look greasy but it was frizzy and felt so thin.  How can my thick, curly hair not be full of body after putting this in my hair?  So I decided to put my hair in a ponytail and even that looked awful.  I never have fly-aways when I pull my  hair back but this day was meant to be a bad hair day.  It looked as I rubbed a balloon over my head and several hairs where sticking here and there.  I am stuck with this entire bottle...any takers? Seriously.</li>
    <li> for kimberly schlapman, it&#x27;s good enough for me!  it&#x27;s very smooth and light on my kinky blonde hair.  it arrived quickly and shipped very safely.  i&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times so far, but so far so good!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy but it works well. Recently my hair got damaged from a &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; colorist not doing it right -- as a result I have all broken ends all over me hair, like a halo.  This product helps as it absorbs into the hair whereas the oil just sits on top of the hair.  Any help I can get for this hair problem, which I&#x27;ve never encountered before, I will take.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> I have really curly hair and this works great by itself or paired with other products.</li>
    <li> The only product i have found that helps my frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I just received Moroccan Oil Intense Curl Cream.  This is not a Moroccan product!!! My stylist has been using this on my hair for months... I know what the product is and what it smells like.  This is some type of nasty lotion.  The pump was up which I thought was OK that can happen....  Then I noticed the QR symbol was careful cut off the package, and then a huge sticker covered the back stating it is a new product.  It is a new product... some type of cheap lotion.  Never again, Amazon will ever order any beautiful products from you.</li>
    <li> This product is great for naturally curly hair. It defines the curl well, but may not be moisturising enough for my hair. I always end up having to add another product for my hair to look shiny.</li>
    <li> My hair is thick, and puffy without product. I rub a tiny dime size amount to my wet hair and then style it. It smells SO good and leaves my hair feeling soft and tamed. The bottle lasts me six month or more.</li>
    <li> Best hair product for mixed girls that have curly hair and want to keep that frizz down or those baby hairs under control. The only product I use and like, I have tried many many different products.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that keeps my frizzies at bay...plus it smells awesome and reminds me if the beach</li>
    <li> Love this cream because it does not leave the curls hard at all.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it does not smell like all the Moroccanoil products but other than that it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I love it. Soo nice and smell great</li>
    <li> my daughter uses it, and she loves the way it keeps her curls in place, she like the smell of it and the fact that it moisturizes her hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter has naturally curly hair. The salon we frequent used this product in her hair and she loved it, however, I was NOT prepared the $50 that the salon was charging for it. This is a great product at an excellent price.</li>
    <li> Use two small pumps for medium length hair. Gives great body and shine!&lt;br /&gt;Best hair product ever.</li>
    <li> This product is great it gives your curls really tight which I like.  Only thing I found this product less expensive in a beauty salon in Greenpoint</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, coarse, natural wavy hair but this didn&#x27;t work.  I wish it did!  It left residue &amp; didn&#x27;t hold the wave/curl.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product for someone who has ultra dry hair, which, mine is not. Originally purchased it because I thought it would get rid of frizz, but it&#x27;s too heavy for all around use.  I can only use it on the tips of my long hair</li>
    <li> I love this product for my curly hair</li>
    <li> Pretty heavy and doesnt smell good like others in this product line. Overall ok</li>
    <li> I tried this instead of the regular hair cream. It is a little thicker, but I don&#x27;t see a difference in the hold. I prefer the fragrance of the regular cream .</li>
    <li> I really like how it helps with the frizz in my hair but for my hair I have to use more than recommended as I have long, thick hair.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to women who have hair like mine, often straight and stringy.  It works for me and my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Moroccan Oil products for about nine months now and it has done wonders for my hair. Couldn&#x27;t be happier! As far as I know, this is a legitimate Moroccan Oil product. It smells like my salon bought stuff, and works great in my hair. Would recommend to anyone with curly hair!</li>
    <li> I love this product so much that I ordered the shampoo and conditioner recently. I usually will brush my hair, apply some moose, and then take some of this cream, put it between my hands and scrunch it on my bottoms ends of my hair. I love how it comes out, it loosens the curls (kind of gives you a little bit of a surfer curl look) and I have been getting so many compliments that even my guy friends are noticing and guys don&#x27;t usually notice things like that. I love it because it feels light, and it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have all this junk in your hair. I also like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope I have as much luck with their shampoo and conditioner! Just ordered it and should be arriving soon.</li>
    <li> This cream is the best treatment for straight hair and when you need to do any serious styling.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I use this product everyday. I find it a little heavy and sticky after a few days. It does provide great curls. I have another product that is a little lighter. Not sure if I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed, I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference in curls. To me it functions just as well as cheaper products</li>
    <li> I like this product. But by the end of the day my hair feels griss. alright but i am not blown away</li>
    <li> Excellent product for my coarse, curly hair. It helps tame frizz, smells great and does a fantastic job on my hair.</li>
    <li> I have very thick coarse curly hair - I have tried tons of products and nothing works as well as this Intense Curl Cream. A little goes a long way - well worth every penny. It also smells great!</li>
    <li> Last time I had my hair cut the hair dresser used this stuff and it made my hair look so nice. I use it daily now and I&#x27;m very happy with how it&#x27;s working. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> i love this product it really helped activate my curls. Im honestly obsessed with it, I had heat damage and recently did a big cut to get my curls back  and the curl cream helped shape my curls and give me a soft curly short mini fro (&#x3D;</li>
    <li> All curly hair hotties MUST have this STASHED :)  A bit pricey but totally fabulous, washing your hair &amp; simply applying this cream.  Wrapping my hair in a towel with the product makes my curls look WONDERFUL.  Soft &amp; bouncy, shiny &amp; perfect.</li>
    <li> Anyone with curly hair, this is one of the best products out there. It will make your your hair so soft, it is unbelievable!</li>
    <li> Excellent result. My wife love It!</li>
    <li> It really works in my curly Hair!!! Love it, and want to buy another cream bottle. my hair is shining a lot</li>
    <li> This product leaves you hair feeling soft and healthy. I put it in right after a shower and let it dry naturally. Curls look great!</li>
    <li> Everyone one in the family loves this product and it smells great!!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter swims a lot so her hair get very dry and damaged, after appling the oil it&#x27;s been so much better and has a wonderful shine</li>
    <li> Pros: Moroccan Oil Intense Curl Cream, 300ml Bottle is the best curl cream I have ever bought!!! I have tried ever curl product out there and this is the only one that really helps my hair curl and tame frizz. It&#x27;s not greasy, not oily, doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, it&#x27;s perfect. The product really works! You only use about a dime size each time so it can last up to 6 months or longer depending on how many times you use it in a day. It smells good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It&#x27;s kind of expensive but it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Product was recommended by hair stylist.  I was hesitant since it was &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; but wow, what an amazing product!  It provides the necessary moisture naturally curly hair needs and great control.</li>
    <li> gives your hair extra bounce and real ringlets without the stiffness.</li>
    <li> This product earns five stars because it made my frizzy, dry looking, extremely curly hair manageable and shiny. It is a bit pricey, but one pump dispensed onto your palm and massaged into your hair is all you need. A little goes a long way. If too much product is used, your hair will look oily and weighted down. I would recommend this product to anyone that is trying to tame a head of wild, curly locks.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as smooth coming out the bottle as other MoroccanOil products. Doesn&#x27;t give great hold. Would recommend MoroccanOil Hydrating Styling Cream over this product.</li>
    <li> After years of searching for a hair product good for curly hair, I found the Moroccan line.  I love the way it makes my hair feel, healthy with a rich clean scent. The Curl Cream&#x27;s perfect for removing the frizz and getting your curls to corkscrew.  The trick, don&#x27;t comb your hair after you wash it.  Just run your fingers through and remove any excess hair.  Towel dry and put the cream in whilst your hair is still a little damp, including the top of your head, scrunch your hair in your hands to define the curls.  I let my hair dry under a fitted knit or ski hat.</li>
    <li> Love this! Makes your hair feel great, not sticky or oily!</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  I don&#x27;t use anything else when I want my hair to have a curlier look.  I have wavy mid-length hair, that usually blah, flat waves when I air dry.  I use just a little bit to rub through my hair after using a pick to get out the knots (not a comb!) and then &amp;#34;crimp&amp;#34; my hair with my fingers and air dry.  I have nice curls without loss or frizz</li>
    <li> I found this oily in my hair and it did not manage frizz,  not at all satisfactory especially considering how expensive it is.  I disliked it so much that I returned it.Bed head&#x27;s curl cream is MUCH better.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cream for curly hair. It is just heavy enough to cover the strands of my hair and maintain my curls while also keeping the moisture. I find other creams either too heavy or too light- this is a great balance.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe there are even good reviews for this product. I have been using Moroccan oil for about a year now and I can completely tell that the bottle I have has been tampered with.</li>
    <li> Doesnt keep your hair curly. Not worthed for the high price. I wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> Best product for curly hair worth the price</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I have curly, frizzy hair and it truly helps in taming it and making it softer.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Great non greasy product!</li>
    <li> Curly hair and humid climates do not go hand in hand. This has been the best product for me. It does not keep it frizz free, but it does keep it much less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;This will only make sense to you if you have fine, long, very curly hair that reacts immediately to humid climes!</li>
    <li> I love this product and can&#x27;t live with out it! I use it after using an all in one shampoo and conditioner. I apply a small amount to my palms and then rub it through my hair. Next I scrunch my hair with a paper towel or my hands. After I literally have soft springy frizz free ringlets.</li>
    <li> If you have curly hair that frizzes, this product is great to use.  It softens the hair without weighing it down and makes it look shiny.</li>
    <li> This product is great for curly hair! A little goes a long way and its good for smoothing frizz and finger styling!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product. It came as described in the description and it works amazingy well with my hair. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My course, thick curls felt great after using this product, but the frizz control just wasn&#x27;t strong enough, especially on the second or third day. The curls didn&#x27;t spiral the way I wanted them too either. I think this would be a great product to use in conjunction with something tougher. It gets rid of snags and mini-dreads that my hair likes to form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also giving it three stars because the pump doesn&#x27;t work on mine - I have to unscrew it and use it as a scoop. Annoying, but I can still use the product.</li>
    <li> This product works as advertised, but it is too heavy for my wavy hair.  This is meant for one with extremely curly hair.  If that&#x27;s you, you should try it.</li>
    <li> Smells so strong (not like Moroccan oil).  It&#x27;s just a thick lotion paste!  Dries out my hair!  Not like regular Salon purchased Moroccan Oil products!!!</li>
    <li> I like this product, it makes my hair look and feel healthy. It&#x27;s great for highlighted hair that often gets dry and frizzy...this takes all that away... I recommend Moroccan Oil Intense Curl Cream.</li>
    <li> It was not what I thought I was ordering. I actually wanted the Hydrating Styling Cream. This product is much thicker and weighted my hair down. Did not attempt to return as it was my mistake.</li>
    <li> Great product but the dispenser did not work. Had to use a different one from an old bottle.</li>
    <li> I naturally have wavy hair. I used a small amount of the Moroccan curl cream works great, didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like other curling mouse or creams I have used before. Leaves my hair looking healthy. The only problem was when I received my bottle&lt;br /&gt;the pump doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.</li>
    <li> iT KEEPS MY HAIR CONDITIONED, FRIZZY FREE, and shiny curly.  I WOULD PURCHASE THIS AGAIN.  the SIZE WILL GO A LONG WAY!!!!</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair and this works better than nything I&#x27;ve tried!! I will be buying again and again!</li>
    <li> This a fabulous product and a little goes a long way.  My hair is soft, movable and shiny.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot because the product is very thick.  It tames the frizzies and smells good too.  I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> For starters, this smelled like an old hair salon....like stale or rancid aerosol hairspray....and the smell didn&#x27;t go away till it was washed out.  I received a bottle with the pump still down and the bottle full....I have to think it was an unopened product, but....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fine potentially wavy hair seemed to be weighed down...unlike how regular Moroccan oil leaves it.  And it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect frizz or tangling as well, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to stick to the oil.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product, price and shipping</li>
    <li> I like the product but the pump doesn&#x27;t work which is very frustrating. For the cost of the product, the pump should work so I don&#x27;t have to dig out the product with the straw part of the pump.  I would give the product 4 stars otherwise (I have 3 daughters with curly hair, all with a different texture.  This product is great for keeping the frizz under control, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crunchy, and holds the curl.)</li>
    <li> Just OK, does not seem to enhance curl tho it does have a conditioning effect, almost over-conditioning.  I use sparingly on wet hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many curl products, I can&#x27;t even tell you.  Gels work best to hold my curl but I can&#x27;t stand the crunch.  Creams usually make my hair soft, but they don&#x27;t hold curl. This product holds my curls perfectly with no crunch!  My hair, which can get puffy and frizzy, lays softly on my shoulders and the curls hold up even in humidity. I can&#x27;t say enough. The oil also conditions, so my hair feels silky without being heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, frizzy hair (but curly).  This product works best when it&#x27;s slightly damp.  It helps hold the curl and takes away some of the frizz.  I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different products, but this is one of the better ones.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have curly hair that gets all out of sorts during humid weather.  This product helps keep it smooth and helps create nice curls.</li>
    <li> a great product for curly hair. Dryer or air dry. I love how this works with my hair which is soft curls not very tight ones.</li>
    <li> I bought this due to the glowing reviews, but after a few tries, I know this isn&#x27;t for me. It makes my hair look greasy but doesn&#x27;t define or moisturize my waves.  I am Asian with unstereotypical course, wavy black hair.</li>
