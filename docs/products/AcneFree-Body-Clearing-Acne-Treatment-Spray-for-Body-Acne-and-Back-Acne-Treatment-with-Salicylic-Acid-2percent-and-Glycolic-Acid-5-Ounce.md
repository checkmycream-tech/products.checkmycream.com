      <li>I never saw a drastic difference, I just liked using it knowing</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work and has very strong fumes when you spray it on.</li>
      <li>There is a very strong odor so hold a cloth over your nose when you apply and be in a well ventilated area.</li>
      <li>/hives I&#x27;ve had in my life, and I&#x27;ve had more than my share of allergic reactions.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s better than scarring acne.</li>
      <li>Pretty nice once you learn how to control the spray!</li>
      <li>Make sure to use sunscreen when using this product.</li>
      <li>They do have a body wash, very large bottle with squirt top that works good.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Once you are used to it, though, it&#x27;s quite easy to use; just like applying sunscreen to yourself in summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product has a strong alcohol smell that will make your nostrils burn when you use it.</li>
      <li>Love it and really helped but the smell is very strong.</li>
      <li>and it leaves a fine mist.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to apply as you just spray it on the area and dries very fast.</li>
      <li>And now we noticed a huge difference when he didn&#x27;t use it while we were on a one-week vacation.</li>
      <li>But I say it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
      <li>and it can get a bit overwhelming at first.</li>
      <li>(I cough if I don&#x27;t cover up my mouth and face with my free hand, it&#x27;s quite potent), but it dries quite fast.</li>
      <li>I love that I can spray my own back and not have to have hubby do it.  </li>
      <li>I always have to stand awkwardly near some kind of ventilation.</li>
      <li>I used Neutrogena&#x27;s version of this product before and liked it, but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in stores near me.</li>
      <li>It can be applied in seconds and dries quickly.  </li>
      <li>It really does a good job of getting to one&#x27;s back.</li>
      <li>This product has great range and dries pretty quickly, less than a minute.  </li>
      <li>good rival to pro active...</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t live without this spray never ever again!!!</li>
      <li>It works pretty good for body acne, you can spray upside down or sideways.</li>
      <li>could compare it to others,  but the fact that I can actually put it where I need it makes it automatically better than the rest.</li>
      <li>back before with no issues, but this seemed to cause more breakouts.</li>
      <li>You also have to hold your breath for about 20 seconds after you spay it (or run into a different room) because the most lingers in the air and burns when you breathe it in.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say my back is 95% better and almost all</li>
      <li>I bought this from Walgreens in August and in the first week noticed my acne had started to subside.  </li>
      <li>Very drying!</li>
      <li>I saw results in the first week.</li>
      <li>Now I can wear my cute tops without having to worry about acne on my back.  </li>
      <li>This product is very sticky compared to Nuterogeana!</li>
      <li>First time using this</li>
      <li>Works pretty well.</li>
      <li>the big question here: which is better?</li>
      <li>Also remember that this is causing your skin to become sensitive to UV rays, so if you are using it and plan on being outside shirtless often (like I am) do not forget your sunscreen on top of this!</li>
      <li>In only 3 days using it, I could already see a huge difference, I&#x27;d say 75% better in 3 days, today I&#x27;ve been only using this spray for a week now (yes 7 days)</li>
      <li>but I discovered that rubbing a towel over the area pretty much solved that issue.</li>
      <li>The ability to spray upside down and from and angle is nice, but it leaves a sticky film on your skin.</li>
      <li>an Acne clearing product, I haven&#x27;t been this satisfied in a very long time.</li>
      <li>Its so easy to apply to me back and helps a lot...</li>
      <li>it is such a fine mist</li>
      <li>Worked very well for me.</li>
      <li>I actually really like this product</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a miracle for having great results in such a short time!</li>
      <li>and it really did help my complexion.</li>
      <li>didnt really work for me</li>
      <li>Much cheaper</li>
      <li>clear!!!</li>
      <li>I purchased this for the first time a few months back and loved it.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this product at the store I usually go to, but I use this after the soap I use and it works great, it keeps my back from breaking out.</li>
      <li>Over the years I visited several dermatologists about the problem and they would prescribe medicine that did absolutely nothing (or even made the condition worse) or tried to sell me their own &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; that they created (which was always some BS product that was nothing more than unscented skin lotion).</li>
      <li>This is actually probably more of a 4, but I&#x27;m feeling generous because a product actually does what it says it does.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if it works or not, but I do love the spray bottle, much better than other brands.</li>
      <li>I thought I would give this a shot since it had more Salycic Acid but defenitley not worth it for the amount of stickiness!</li>
      <li>I usually apply this after the shower (after dry) and the smell is quite strong, but make sure you&#x27;re in a well ventilated room.</li>
      <li>I like the continuous spray better than the neutrogena spray which doesn&#x27;t always work at strange angles on the back.</li>
      <li>This definitely helps clear up the break outs and quick.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and clears up minor to moderate skin issues.  </li>
      <li>Within the first month my back was 80% improved and within two months I saw 95% improvement.  </li>
      <li>This is an amazing product!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been fighting in the past year w acne on my back, I&#x27;ve tried everything I could and</li>
      <li>My husband is back and chest were pretty clear after a month of use.</li>
      <li>I switched back to the Neutrogena version because it works better, doesn&#x27;t make the skin feel tight and doesn&#x27;t set my lungs on fire.</li>
      <li>Also, it is effective in reducing my bacne (if you can get someone to help you spray tough spots).</li>
      <li>Neutrogena&#x27;s product (Body Clear Body Spray</li>
      <li>this product is not for sensitive skin it does cause some dryness</li>
      <li>I saw a marked improvement in my skin</li>
      <li>my chest acne is nearly cleared up.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and the Neutrogena spray doesn&#x27;t seem to help in terms of acne, so I was hoping this would.</li>
      <li>Nearly gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Put it on straight out of shower and try to let dry/soak in as much as possible before dressing (a fan speeds the process up).  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my 16 year old son.</li>
      <li>worth the money spent.</li>
      <li>The only thing it helped with was putting my normal skin complexion in perspective!</li>
      <li>Yes, it is a bit sticky at first, but give it 5-10 minutes to dry before you put your shirt on</li>
      <li>I would probably buy this over the neutrogena product again as the spray system is better and a little less sticky, also it dries faster which is very convenient.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my son who is retinal sensitive and after trying every prescription product out there and numerous antibiotics his back is beyond broke out to the point it&#x27;s leaving dark purple scarring , so we gave this a shot when I apply it from a distance he doesn&#x27;t complain of the stickiness so that may come from  not being able to get far enough away from the skin when self applying.</li>
      <li>Wish it was more of a directional spray too because it got in my hair a bit while spraying my upper back and dried out my hair a bit.</li>
      <li>Slight stickiness is worth the results.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this for the first time a few months back and loved it. I reordered it and noticed it now leaves a sticky film. The previous one I had purchased did not do this at all. I&#x27;m going to keep using it, but if the next one I order still leaves a sticky film, I&#x27;ll be returning it.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been fighting in the past year w acne on my back, I&#x27;ve tried everything I could and nothing worked, until I try this amazing Spray from Acne Free!!! In only 3 days using it, I could already see a huge difference, I&#x27;d say 75% better in 3 days, today I&#x27;ve been only using this spray for a week now (yes 7 days) and I can see even better results! I&#x27;d say my back is 95% better and almost all clear!!! It&#x27;s such a miracle for having great results in such a short time! I won&#x27;t live without this spray never ever again!!! Can&#x27;t wait to try more products of this brand!!!</li>
    <li> Love it and really helped but the smell is very strong. Wish it was more of a directional spray too because it got in my hair a bit while spraying my upper back and dried out my hair a bit. But definitely helped my acne!!</li>
    <li> I bought this at a CVS nearby. It works pretty good for body acne, you can spray upside down or sideways. I saw a marked improvement in my skin but I would not get this product again. This product has a strong alcohol smell that will make your nostrils burn when you use it. I always have to stand awkwardly near some kind of ventilation.</li>
    <li> the only thing that works for my buttne!!! it&#x27;s wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> Worked very well for me. Yes, it is a bit sticky at first, but give it 5-10 minutes to dry before you put your shirt on and it&#x27;s fine. Works extremely well, cleans up all acne within a few weeks. Slight stickiness is worth the results.</li>
    <li> I have tried Neutrogena Ance Bodywash before with no success but this product actually works. I didn&#x27;t remember to use it every day but the days I did use it were very effective. The bottle didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected so next time I&#x27;ll just order the 3 pack. Easy to use. It does leave a bit of a filmy feel on your skin but I discovered that rubbing a towel over the area pretty much solved that issue. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works well.  My only complaint is that it makes my skin sticky until it dries completely--which takes a while.</li>
    <li> My skin is oily and acne prone.&lt;br /&gt;This makes it worse and its sticky</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. I like the continuous spray better than the neutrogena spray which doesn&#x27;t always work at strange angles on the back. It claims to be &amp;#34;not sticky&amp;#34; but I found it to be slightly sticky, but I didn&#x27;t have an issue with it, I almost expected it. I would probably buy this over the neutrogena product again as the spray system is better and a little less sticky, also it dries faster which is very convenient.</li>
    <li> It really does a good job of getting to one&#x27;s back. Used in combination with a good cleanser it is a very good treatment option if you don&#x27;t want/can&#x27;t spend a fortune for prescription stuff.</li>
    <li> Quite simply, this product works.</li>
    <li> I only used this for a few days because it leaves my skin feeling tacky all day. I&#x27;d put it on in the morning after I shower and I still feel gross by the end of the day. I&#x27;ve used both Salicylic acid and Glycolic acid on my arms/back before with no issues, but this seemed to cause more breakouts. Probably because of how sticky it is.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product at the store I usually go to, but I use this after the soap I use and it works great, it keeps my back from breaking out. I ran out once and my back slowly started to break out again. Thats how I know the combination of this and the soap I use work great together.</li>
    <li> This did not work at all for me, though I know it worked well for others. My skin had a rash type reaction and looked much, much worse. The only thing it helped with was putting my normal skin complexion in perspective! Before using this product my skin was way clearer than after!</li>
    <li> This is actually works you can spray in any direction and it leaves a fine mist. You may have to walk around for a few minutes so it dries. My husband is back and chest were pretty clear after a month of use. And now we noticed a huge difference when he didn&#x27;t use it while we were on a one-week vacation.</li>
    <li> Burns burns burns burns. You can&#x27;t target your acne areas with a spray and it felt like my skin was peeling after a sunburn. Acne did not improve</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if it works or not, but I do love the spray bottle, much better than other brands. However it does dry pretty slowly in comparison to others, but that&#x27;s not that big of a problem.</li>
    <li> This is actually probably more of a 4, but I&#x27;m feeling generous because a product actually does what it says it does. Ever since I was a teenager I&#x27;ve had a small spot of trouble area on my chest, and a few here and there on my back. I used Neutrogena&#x27;s version of this product before and liked it, but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in stores near me. At my local Target, I found this and decided to give it a shot. First of all, this isn&#x27;t a little spritz can like Neutrogena&#x27;s, this is a full-on sunscreen-style spray can and it can get a bit overwhelming at first. Once you are used to it, though, it&#x27;s quite easy to use; just like applying sunscreen to yourself in summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the big question here: which is better? Neutrogena&#x27;s product (Body Clear Body Spray, I think it&#x27;s called) worked... alright. I never saw a drastic difference, I just liked using it knowing I was doing something to combat my torso acne. But AcneFree&#x27;s Spray? It&#x27;s a monster. A day after I bought it I saw a difference, and now (about a week and a half later) my chest acne is nearly cleared up. Now, remember, I was never breaking out truly badly. It&#x27;s just summer and my family almost lives at the beach and I don&#x27;t have any chest hair to cover it up. But the small problem areas I had? Nearly gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels elastic-y for a bit after I spray it on, and you have to be VERY careful not to spray this stuff on your face (I cough if I don&#x27;t cover up my mouth and face with my free hand, it&#x27;s quite potent), but it dries quite fast. Also remember that this is causing your skin to become sensitive to UV rays, so if you are using it and plan on being outside shirtless often (like I am) do not forget your sunscreen on top of this! I do this at night after a shower, and sunscreen before the beach in the morning and I haven&#x27;t felt any drastic sunburns or discomfort because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an Acne clearing product, I haven&#x27;t been this satisfied in a very long time.</li>
    <li> Occasionally I will get break outs on my back due to sweating and laying on surfaces at the gym. This definitely helps clear up the break outs and quick. It is very easy to apply as you just spray it on the area and dries very fast.</li>
    <li> didnt really work for me</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my back as it is difficult to reach with other topical treatments.  This product has great range and dries pretty quickly, less than a minute.  I have noticed improvement since I began using it and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Worst product ever!  Very sticky even if you use a thin layer.  Also, it made my acne worse!  I thought maybe it would get worse before better but after 3 weeks of everyday use I had to trash this product.  I recommend Neutrogena Body Spray....much better!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week and my skin has cleared up a bit. I actually really like this product (I was very skeptical at first) the only down side is that when you spray it and you try to breath it&#x27;s very hard and feel like you&#x27;re choking. Probably a comparison to pepper spray but not even close to those effects. I also find that it is sticky on my skin. But I say it&#x27;s worth a try! It works!</li>
    <li> Hard to find aerosol &amp;#34;astringent&amp;#34; spray for back-ne, etc.  This is the only one I&#x27;ve found.  I&#x27;ve even used this to prevent ingrown hairs and razor burn as well.  Put it on straight out of shower and try to let dry/soak in as much as possible before dressing (a fan speeds the process up).  Has helped to clear up skin over the pas few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By only complaint is that it is a small volume of spray for somewhat larger and extensive coverage--5-10 applications for your back.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say whether or not this spray was effective for me, because the only thing it did was give me a HORRIBLE reaction. I have sensitive skin and the Neutrogena spray doesn&#x27;t seem to help in terms of acne, so I was hoping this would. Unfortunately I must be allergic to something in it, because it gave me the worst rash/hives I&#x27;ve had in my life, and I&#x27;ve had more than my share of allergic reactions.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work and has very strong fumes when you spray it on.</li>
    <li> good rival to pro active... Much cheaper</li>
    <li> For years and years I suffered with body acne a month of using this I was cured! I was I&#x27;m disbelief I hate the smell and hard to breath everytime I spray it I had mild to bad bode acne so I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This spray has helped with my ingrown hairs as well as the scars left behind from ingrowns. I usually apply this after the shower (after dry) and the smell is quite strong, but make sure you&#x27;re in a well ventilated room. It has great ingredients with AHA and BHA, so it is bound to help with exfoliation. Also, it is effective in reducing my bacne (if you can get someone to help you spray tough spots). Make sure to use sunscreen when using this product.</li>
    <li> Helpful to skin breakouts but the spray gets inhaled if not careful.</li>
    <li> worth the money spent. cleared my bacne up in no time. Very drying!</li>
    <li> Pretty nice once you learn how to control the spray! Cleared my skin up.</li>
    <li> I bought this from Walgreens and this stuff is amazing! Its so easy to apply to me back and helps a lot... May not be a wonder product of I could compare it to others,  but the fact that I can actually put it where I need it makes it automatically better than the rest. Awesome stuff.</li>
    <li> This product is very sticky compared to Nuterogeana! I thought I would give this a shot since it had more Salycic Acid but defenitley not worth it for the amount of stickiness! After looking at the ingredients it&#x27;s oblivious why it&#x27;s sticky! Too many oils!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who is retinal sensitive and after trying every prescription product out there and numerous antibiotics his back is beyond broke out to the point it&#x27;s leaving dark purple scarring , so we gave this a shot when I apply it from a distance he doesn&#x27;t complain of the stickiness so that may come from  not being able to get far enough away from the skin when self applying. The fumes are bad it is such a fine mist it&#x27;s like fogging yourself, but with 2% salicylic acid this product is not for sensitive skin it does cause some dryness but that&#x27;s better than scarring acne.</li>
    <li> I recently started to use this on my upper back and arms where I have had breakouts my whole life. I saw results in the first week. Over the years I visited several dermatologists about the problem and they would prescribe medicine that did absolutely nothing (or even made the condition worse) or tried to sell me their own &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; that they created (which was always some BS product that was nothing more than unscented skin lotion). This has been the only thing that has worked and I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> The ability to spray upside down and from and angle is nice, but it leaves a sticky film on your skin. You also have to hold your breath for about 20 seconds after you spay it (or run into a different room) because the most lingers in the air and burns when you breathe it in. I switched back to the Neutrogena version because it works better, doesn&#x27;t make the skin feel tight and doesn&#x27;t set my lungs on fire.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this from Amazon but thought I should write a review about it.  Since my 20&#x27;s I have struggle with acne on my back...sometimes so bad it kept me from wearing cute halter tops, bathing suites, or anything where my back would be exposed.  I tried everything including glycolic acid peels which were painful and only worked if I did them daily.  It took 24 years for me to finally find a product that worked!!!  I bought this from Walgreens in August and in the first week noticed my acne had started to subside.  Within the first month my back was 80% improved and within two months I saw 95% improvement.  I have been faithfully using it after I get out of the shower and before I get dressed, giving myself a minute or two before it dries.  The other comments about the fumes are right, but I just hold my breath before I spray, a small price to pay for the results I&#x27;ve gotten.  Now I can wear my cute tops without having to worry about acne on my back.  I am so glad I found this product!</li>
    <li> I love that I can spray my own back and not have to have hubby do it.  Works as well as proactive.  Haven&#x27;t used the other products, I use proactive for other items.  They do have a body wash, very large bottle with squirt top that works good.  This is great for the cystic type of acne....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this only about a week and though I didn&#x27;t have bad acne to begin with, this greatly improved the spots that seemed to never go away. There is a very strong odor so hold a cloth over your nose when you apply and be in a well ventilated area. I think the smell is a small price to pay for the results.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 16 year old son. He&#x27;s been using it for about 2 weeks and has seen no results. I also bought him the AcneFree Sever Acne Treatment System and that worked wonders for him. Unfortunately, this spray has done absolutely nothing for him.</li>
    <li> Longtime sufferer from acne and decided to give this spray a try. I have moderate acne on my back and chest. I had great results with it and it really did help my complexion. Sprayed all over my back and chest. I would not recommend using this on your face as it tends to run a little. One complaint is that it ran out so quickly but I couldn&#x27;t justify taking a star off for that.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and clears up minor to moderate skin issues.  I like this because of the convenience. It can be applied in seconds and dries quickly.  However, the smell is not pleasant and you don&#x27;t want to breathe it in when it is first sprayed.  Also, depending on how much you put on, it can leave a slightly sticky feeling.  It&#x27;s not especially noticeable unless someone touches the skin that has been treated.</li>
    <li> First time using this but it works.</li>
