    <li> Great flask, worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Looks to be very well constructed, no plastic parts that I could see.  Box has Made in China sticker, too bad about that.  Will be &amp;#34;testing&amp;#34; frequently over holiday, no leaks upon initial use.</li>
    <li> This flask started leaking only after a couple of uses.</li>
    <li> The build quality on this flask is as excellent as others have noted. Don&#x27;t buy a cheaper flask that leaks or gives a bad flavor. Do rinse well with soap and water before use.</li>
    <li> This flask leaks through the seams on the bottom of the flask.  My scotch got all over my clothes.  HORRIBLE!!</li>
    <li> I found no leaks or other issues to fret about, EXCEPT:  I do not understand the reason for the warning that alcoholic beverages should not be left in the flask for more than three (3) days!  What?!  If the darn thing is made of any 300 series stainless steel, one should be able to leave any drinkable beverage in there for months.</li>
    <li> This flask seems to be solid (judging by the weight and the way the bottom part is welded in). It is not too heavy. It looks elegant and has good esthetics. I like the color, the design and the feel of it. It has a place to engrave it at the bottom. However, it will take a long time to see if this one stands the test of time. I&#x27;ll keep you posted.</li>
    <li> I love this flask for a few reasons, one it holds more liquid than the average flask so it makes for a better night. That said it is still easy to hide and great for just about any event. I also appreciate the look of it, sleek but different from usual flasks and not tacky like a lot f the decorated ones. It has also held up well.</li>
    <li> The is great quality and true stainless steel. Just right size for your pocket. Does not leak as so many other cheap flask. The right amount liquor for you to enjoy yourself responsibly. Would not hesitate to buy this flask, you will be very pleased with the quality and look of this item. Enjoy!!!!</li>
    <li> Shopped around quite a bit for a flask and in terms of &amp;#34;bang for the buck,&amp;#34; this was the best deal going.  We&#x27;ll made, seals tight and holds a couple of days of booze!</li>
    <li> Received my flask and immediately realized that it had already been used.  The metal etching had dirt built up in it and there were very slight signs of wear on the sides where the etching was smoothed from use.  The inside of the cap was dirty and foreign materials had built up inside the threads for the screw on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very nearly sent it back for a replacement but decided that functionality was more important than looks, so i cleaned it up myself and went on to testing it.  I filled it with water and placed it upside down to check for the cap leaking.  Miraculously, i only got a drop (maybe 2) to leak out in an eight hour period.  Since i don&#x27;t usually stand on my head for 8 hours i assumed i was in clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big night arrived that i had bought it for (Frank Sinatra&#x27;s birthday). I proceeded to fill it with my libation of choice, placed in my chest pocket, and away i went.  It took about 2 hours, but then it became obvious that the flask was leaking from the seam where the bottom plate meets the walls.  My (white) shirt now had obvious whiskey stains and my suit smelled like i was coming off a 4-day bender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angrily, i removed the flask and set it (upright) on the bar.  By the end of the night, the cocktail napkin i had set it on was soaked.  Without ever taking a pull from it, it lost approximately 1/4 of its volume.  That&#x27;s ~2oz in 5hrs..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this pile.  It may seem like a value, but now i realize why nice flasks are priced at a premium.</li>
    <li> Great flask.  At first I regretted having to buy this one.  I had originally wanted the 6oz one, because I thought that was the size I wanted.  But this flask fits perfectly into the back pocket of my slim fit pants.  So, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Bought for my boyfriend for Christmas.  He loves it, stylish, good sealing on the cap.  Bottoms up!</li>
    <li> Nice, high quality flask.  I brought this with me to Montana hunting and it worked great, not leaking a drop and surviving hours of horseback riding in a pack.</li>
    <li> Paid extra to have next days shipping and it arrived in less the 12 hours..  Could not believe it came so early as i had ordered after 5:00 pm est..  The flask is very nice look and did not spill; at all.  It would be nice if it came with a funnel but I made due.  Kept my favorite beverage handy while we walked around and looked at \\&quot;art\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a comfortable affordable flask this is the answer. It is just the right size to fit in the back pocket. It is just the right amount of liquid. I tried their larger one, and it was too large for the back pocket. Beware of the 8 ounce model: it is too big for your back pocket. This one fits just fine. And 8 ounces is more than enough to get \\&quot;the job\\&quot; done.</li>
    <li> Was looming for a last minute gift for groomsmen. Good price quality product.  Easy to mongram.  I would purchase again</li>
    <li> Beautiful, and no leaks</li>
    <li> Looks like something at a SKA show, but it is the best ive seen in accordance with others for sale on amazon. I suggest this to anyone looking for a flask! Cheers!</li>
    <li> Having been looking at flasks for awhile this was recommended to me and I&#x27;m very pleased.  It feels sturdy and the finish and construction is excellent.  I like the quality of the flip cap attachment and the appearance of that of a much more expensive flask.  The Colonel has many options but I really like the patterned finish on this one.  I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 10/15 I&#x27;ve had the flask for a while now and it has been regularly used.  I&#x27;m still very happy with the flask and it has been holding up perfectly.  Not a complaint from me at all.</li>
    <li> This was just what I expected and wanted.  The pattern is unique which makes it easy to identify.  Secure tight lid and no leaks.  This would make a great gift for any gender and/or occasion of just for yourself.</li>
    <li> Does what it is intended to do! My only gripe is that the cap is plastic and seems a bit cheap. However, unless you are pretty tough on it, it should be sturdy enough.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect flask to take with you at night. Easy to fill and also holds a good amount</li>
    <li> Not some cheap junk. Very solid flask not like others made with thin stainless steel. The cap is also metal which I notice some flask are made of plastic with a chrome paint job. The only plastic piece is the piece that holds the cap and hinged to the flask.</li>
    <li> I needed a reasonably priced flask and this was the one. It came and appeared as described on amazon. I was very happy with my selection. I do suggest you buy a funnel for a little bit more to make filling the flask easier.</li>
