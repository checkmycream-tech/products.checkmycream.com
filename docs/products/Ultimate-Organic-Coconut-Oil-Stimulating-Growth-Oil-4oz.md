      <li>I like that it isn&#x27;t super oily and seems to give my hair a healthy shine.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t real sure how to use it but as a hot oil treatment it&#x27;s good but better if used lightly on damp hair after your out of the shower my hair was over processed and this helped to make it a little more manageable</li>

      <li>It makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>

      <li>Smells good not too oily, havn&#x27;t been using it long</li>
      <li>I like this product because it is easy to apply, but I think solid coconut oil works better than this.</li>
      <li>I had perfect curls, no frizz, the volume of my hair reduced to a more normal and acceptable degree, and left it looking shiny, feeling soft and natural, and smelling like coconut.</li>
      <li>Has a nice light scent, not a high coconut smell.</li>
      <li>I just started using this product, but so far I enjoy it!</li>
      <li>I love this natural product for my nails, it seemed to soak right in and help my nails to grow even stronger.</li>
      <li>As an African American woman having healthy, long, shiny hair is a great thing!</li>

      <li>Its perfect for wet or dry hair.</li>
      <li>Smelled great, not overwhelmingly coconut.  </li>
      <li>It went very fast.  </li>
      <li>It has a pleasant smell and isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff.</li>
      <li>Why cant it be unscented or something pleasant and not strong at all?</li>
      <li>I like to use some for a hot oil treatment and after doing this for about 2 months</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>It took me 3 shampoos that evening and 2 more the next morning just so my hair did not look like a grease trap.  </li>
      <li>The 1st time I used it, I put quite a bit from root to tip and left in for most of the day.  </li>
      <li>Firstly, I think the company needs to know what the definition of \\&quot;organic\\&quot; means.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smells good and is supposed to keep hair moisturized, but it actually dried out my scalp.</li>
      <li>I use it in my hair, and my hair hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy in a long time.</li>
      <li>Not sure if my hair has grown any, but it is good at conditioning the ends.</li>
      <li>Its good on skin and hair, just not sure about the &amp;#34;hair growth&amp;#34; part.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, it lingers all day long!</li>
      <li>I really preferred the cream</li>
      <li>My family uses the proudce also Thanks</li>
      <li>Highly recomenned!</li>
      <li>It made it grow so fast</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m using too much.</li>
      <li>was very oily and runny</li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t really see any difference in hair</li>
      <li>my hair was destroyed to a point it would no longer grow but thanks to this</li>
      <li>It organic, and I love mixing it with other oils for my hair.  </li>
      <li>I will continue use really like the results so far.</li>
      <li>, It got here a day early, too soon to tell if it really works.</li>
      <li>I am a white woman with very very curly hair that I am trying to grow out long before I get married.</li>
      <li>It obviously makes you hair a little greasy too, especially if you have naturally straight hair, but it also makes it really healthy and I even noticed some growth.</li>
      <li>IT STILL TO EARLY TO TELL HOW IT WORKS.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fantastic  and is not smell bad at all</li>
    <li> The skin loves it and I love the way it feels</li>
    <li> very happy with the product and very happy with the del.</li>
    <li> I really preferred the cream but this was the only option.</li>
    <li> Ultimately it&#x27;s SOY BEAN OIL. The description is entirely misleading. It&#x27;s also NOT ORGANIC.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve recently started wearing my hair natural, i have 3B type curls and have been trying to repair the damages i&#x27;ve done in the past (i.e. relaxers, flat ironing on a daily basis, bad haircuts, bad highlights), and i bought this product because i needed coconut oil for my hot hair oil treatment. So I combined this with African Royale Hot Six Oil, heated it, and applied it generously through my hair and left it in for about 20 minutes. After i rinsed my hair out i was amazed at the results! I had perfect curls, no frizz, the volume of my hair reduced to a more normal and acceptable degree, and left it looking shiny, feeling soft and natural, and smelling like coconut. So in conclusion, i like this oil for a hot hair oil treatment combined with Hot Six Oil, but i think the bottle is too small, especially if you have an abundant amount of thick curly hair like me, and what&#x27;s with some of the ingredients? for a product that claims to be organic it has a lot of ingredients i&#x27;m pretty sure i wouldn&#x27;t find in nature. Other than that it did the job i bought it for, so i&#x27;m content with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Product came as promised.  Smelled very nice and beachy.  I felt like I was on the beach.  Will be ordering it again soon</li>
    <li> I use this in my hair for treatments.. works perfect and smells awesome! Would recommend to anyone looking to take care of their dead or thin hair!</li>
    <li> Item just as I expected.</li>
    <li> Good oil for your natural hair</li>
    <li> I really like it, It got here a day early, too soon to tell if it really works.</li>
    <li> I really love this product BETTER that EVOO. It makes my hair shiny, soft and smelling good. A little goes a long way; this is definitely a staple for me. I have dry hair issues but using this in combination with ORS Olive Oil Lotion my hair is doing 100% better!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome hands down came on time item was as described I highly recommend and will buy again</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is easy to apply, but I think solid coconut oil works better than this.</li>
    <li> Was definitely disappointed with the  consistency of this product, it&#x27;s super runny. I&#x27;m used  to coconut oils more oil like, not water base feel. It also leaves my hair looking and feeling so greasy, I had to wash it every time I used it. I put coconut oil on my lashes at night, so I tried it with this product  the next morning while  curling my eyelashes they were falling out! No thank you.. sad to say I had to go purchase a different brand and this one&#x27;s just with the other products that I really don&#x27;t care for.</li>
    <li> Feels good on my scalp and it seems to be helping my hair to grow in my bald spots.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it says organic! But it has BHA AND BHT in this product . That&#x27;s why people but organic so we don&#x27;t have to eat the chemicals ..what makes you think we would wear them?!!!!will not purchase again</li>
    <li> Good product but not overly impressed. Its good on skin and hair, just not sure about the &amp;#34;hair growth&amp;#34; part.</li>
    <li> love this coconut oil, a little does go a long way. i noticed growth and it made my hair feel healthier. the only downside is that i do think it&#x27;s a bit cheaper at the beauty supply, so i&#x27;d try there before buying here. save your coins if you can. but this is a great product and i love it</li>
    <li> Very good stuff works for me love the smell</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for this product it is to greassy for me</li>
    <li> This product had a great smell to it and I used it for my entire body as well as my daughter.  I&#x27;m needing to replace my bottle that I&#x27;ve already used this product was really great everyone should give it a try.</li>
    <li> Firstly, I think the company needs to know what the definition of \\&quot;organic\\&quot; means.  Just because you use real coconut oil, doesn&#x27;t mean you can call a product organic.  When you add things like parfum, BHA, BHT, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, benzophenone-4, t-butyl hydroquinone, phenyl trimethicone and propylPARABEN, it not only makes it unorganic, but toxic and cancerous.  The company should be banned for false advertisement.</li>
    <li> It went very fast.  Just wish it came in a larger size.  It has a very light and pleasing fragrance.</li>
    <li> very good herb aND SERVICE</li>
    <li> I had really soft skin for a few days, then I woke up one morning with swollen eyelids from an allergic reaction!</li>
    <li> was very oily and runny</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smells good and is supposed to keep hair moisturized, but it actually dried out my scalp. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought it was.</li>
    <li> Smells nice but it&#x27;s a little too greasy for my liking. I prefer something that adds moisture to hair without giving it a wet look. I only use a very small amount so it&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m using too much.</li>
    <li> I have blonde fine hair and was not sure this would work for me.  I do like it, but be careful.  The 1st time I used it, I put quite a bit from root to tip and left in for most of the day.  It took me 3 shampoos that evening and 2 more the next morning just so my hair did not look like a grease trap.  I now just put on the ends of my hair.  I also use it on my nails and skin and love it for that purpose.  Not sure if my hair has grown any, but it is good at conditioning the ends.</li>
    <li> Bought this to make my hair grow, have had it a couple months no growth at all.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product!!! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I GOT THIS TO PROMOTE HATR GROWTH IT STILL TO EARLY TO TELL HOW IT WORKS.</li>
    <li> Great price, makes hair shiny and smell good.</li>
    <li> Though it may not be 100% organic, this product is beyond amazing. It makes my hair smooth and shiny. It also smells so good that I have people asking me what I use to make my hair smell so good! Its perfect for wet or dry hair. I like to use some for a hot oil treatment and after doing this for about 2 months (on the same bottle) I can say my hair is saved! I went from black hair to blonde, then to brown... my hair was destroyed to a point it would no longer grow but thanks to this...in the last 2 months alone my hair has grown a good 4 inches.</li>
    <li> have not used it long enough to see any results, but looking forward to it. I love the smell, it lingers all day long!</li>
    <li> Smelled great, not overwhelmingly coconut.  I could see results quickly. I would order this again.</li>
    <li> Smells good not too oily, havn&#x27;t been using it long but hair feels better, looks better. I would recommend this product.  I will continue use really like the results so far.</li>
    <li> I like that it isn&#x27;t super oily and seems to give my hair a healthy shine. Put on the roots before washing hair too.</li>
    <li> This is so good for your hair makes it soft too</li>
    <li> I like this oil.  It makes my hair soft and shiny I would buy it again and also recommend it.  It is costly but you only have to use a small amount..</li>
    <li> I love my coconut oil! I am a white woman with very very curly hair that I am trying to grow out long before I get married. This oil makes my hair SOOO soft, it is amazing. I recommend this to anyone. It obviously makes you hair a little greasy too, especially if you have naturally straight hair, but it also makes it really healthy and I even noticed some growth. I had my fiancé feel my hair and he couldn&#x27;t stop playing with it. I love this product and will be getting it again!</li>
    <li> Very good product lite don&#x27;t weigh hair down</li>
    <li> Great product keeps hair shiny not to oily &amp; helps the hair grow!!!! love it</li>
    <li> Love this oil for my hair</li>
    <li> Use this in my hair too.</li>
    <li> My hair is amazingly soft after application and lasts until my next wash which is usually every other week and has grown about 2 1/2 ( two and a half) inches by using this full bottle of oil. It has a pleasant smell and isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff. As an African American woman having healthy, long, shiny hair is a great thing! I am very satisfied and I recommend this product. Also organic grape seed oils.</li>
    <li> Keeps hair nice and soft.  Growth has been good.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product, but so far I enjoy it! Hoping it will help my hair grow!</li>
    <li> will purchase this again...</li>
    <li> Great, thanks for the quick delivery!</li>
    <li> This coconut oil is the best! I use it for a hot oil treatment to my fine thin hair. It works great for me, i love it!</li>
    <li> Love this product! A little goes a long way. I use it in my hair, and my hair hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy in a long time. Has a nice light scent, not a high coconut smell. Almost feel like my hair has grown, and only started using it 3 weeks ago. Been also using it on my skin and helps with rough feet. Highly recomenned!</li>
    <li> It is a very good oil</li>
    <li> The smell of it gives me headache and makes me nausea, although it is really good for my hair. I just hate the smell of it. Why cant it be unscented or something pleasant and not strong at all?</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t real sure how to use it but as a hot oil treatment it&#x27;s good but better if used lightly on damp hair after your out of the shower my hair was over processed and this helped to make it a little more manageable</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase</li>
    <li> love my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was dry from chemical use and since using this product I have noticed a big change.</li>
    <li> I have been reading a lot about the uses of coconut oil for hair and skin. This comes in a 2 bottle pack and convenient squeeze bottle!</li>
    <li> Made my skin and nail look so great... very nice on the nails. My family uses the proudce also Thanks</li>
    <li> Great product but you can buy this at your local beauty supply store for like 2.99.</li>
    <li> Great for my hair and skin.. Love this!!</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, curly hair (black/white/PR) and it unfortunately did not work well with my hair type. Too bad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short period of time. So, I am not sure if my hair has started growing yet. But, its definitely a heavier oil, and it keeps my hair and scalp moisturized!</li>
    <li> smells nice don&#x27;t really see any difference in hair</li>
    <li> I rated this product five stars because it delivered what it promised.  A little goes a long way so go easy on it.</li>
