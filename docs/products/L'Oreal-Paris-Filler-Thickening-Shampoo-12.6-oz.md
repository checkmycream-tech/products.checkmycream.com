      <li>I liked this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine hair that lacks volume.</li>
      <li>It is an ok shampoo, but it didn&#x27;t do much for my baby fine silky hair, :D ...</li>
      <li>It adds a nice amount of volume, has pleasant odor and is reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>While it didn&#x27;t do what it promised, I still enjoyed the shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I would expect better from this company.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use this and will probably order more.</li>
      <li>Think it will just take time to be able to see it.</li>
      <li>I love this product and everything about it.</li>
      <li>If your hair is kinky, you may have to use more Castor Oil and perhaps a wee bit more</li>
      <li>As the day went on I found myself touching my hair and liking the way it felt.</li>
      <li>Gotta love THAT.</li>
      <li>the better my hair looks and feels.</li>
      <li>Combined, they made my hair appear even thicker and fuller, with more body.</li>
      <li>Gotta love THAT.</li>
      <li>This shampoo performs better than $49-per-liter shampoos that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: The longer I use this shampoo and its companion products the better my hair looks and feels.</li>
      <li>I like the bottle shape, makes it easy to use in shower.</li>
      <li>My hair has always been baby fine</li>
      <li>It has a really nice smell and my hair feels thicker and looks so much nicer.</li>
      <li>It lathered well, left my hair squeaky clean and had a pleasant mild fragrance.  </li>
      <li>this one by far is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I have very straight hair with no body.</li>
      <li>I used the conditioner and the 3 week treatment along with this and will most likely be buying another set when I run out.  </li>
      <li>My hair definitely looks and feels thicker and softer, and it has more body.</li>
      <li>this shampoo works,  I noticed the difference after the first use.  </li>
      <li>thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>This shampoo leaves hair very soft and full.</li>
      <li>leaves my hair shiny, soft, thicker appearing and full of body.</li>
      <li>My only positive point to make is that it has a pleasant smell akin to and expected of the L&#x27;Oreal brand.</li>
      <li>This product really works</li>
      <li>and I feel absolutely bamboozled.</li>
      <li>this really does make you feel and look like if your hair was thicker</li>
      <li>I will probably just throw the rest out since it doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
      <li>I really hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this product.</li>
      <li>After I tried it , I noticed right after drying my hair that it was so soft and felt thicker with just that one shampoo.</li>
      <li>On another note In past reviews I&#x27;ve seen on YouTube and read I noticed most ppl who mixed this with a different brand did not have good results.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair so it must be rough or drying to make my hair feel dry!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how much thicker it actually makes the hair strands, but it does definitely add volume to fine hair.</li>
      <li>It is typically straight and fairly shiny, but with this, it was frizzy and even difficult to brush through.</li>
      <li>At $6 for the big daddy bottle, that only positive isn&#x27;t worth the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>From the first shampoo to after 3 wks of use I can see an overall improvement on my hair.</li>
      <li>As far as claims of adding volume to fine/thin hair over time, don&#x27;t hold your breath.</li>
      <li>Now, as far as a cleansing shampoo goes, yes, that it does.</li>
      <li>I was very sadly surprised that this shampoo would do this.</li>
      <li>Later I purchased the shampoo and WOW!</li>
      <li>If anything, it made it look even more thin.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much of the gel; it will only dry out your hair and leave it dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Leaves hair too soft and flat.  </li>

<li> I then mix a tiny bit of d:fi heavy wax and a small amount of Hollywood Beauty Castor Oil in my hand and work it through my hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> this shampoo works,  I noticed the difference after the first use.  I am very happy with this transaction .  Thank you.</li>
    <li> it gives volume to your hair!  it is a bit drying why i dont know but u need to use  a conditioner&lt;br /&gt;with it to soften the hair.  I have fine hair so it must be rough or drying to make my hair feel dry!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like it but wish it was not so drying</li>
    <li> Makes thin hair feel fuller.  Can snarl hair.</li>
    <li> As far as claims of adding volume to fine/thin hair over time, don&#x27;t hold your breath. This shampoo falls short of producing any thickening/volumizing results period. I&#x27;ve been using this product in hopes of the slightest result for 7 months and I feel absolutely bamboozled. I find it extremely hard to believe that other reviewers are stating it does. Calling BS on that one. Now, as far as a cleansing shampoo goes, yes, that it does. In fact, it cleans hair so well, it dries out your scalp to the point of creating that unsightly flaky stuff called dandruff. My only positive point to make is that it has a pleasant smell akin to and expected of the L&#x27;Oreal brand. At $6 for the big daddy bottle, that only positive isn&#x27;t worth the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 star rating for lack of results and deceptive advertising.</li>
    <li> The price is great and the fragrance is okay so I deicded to take a break from Bumble and Bumble Thickening Shampoo to try this. It is awful. My hair felt greasy and tangled. It is typically straight and fairly shiny, but with this, it was frizzy and even difficult to brush through.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different volume shampoo&#x27;s this one by far is my favorite. It has a really nice smell and my hair feels thicker and looks so much nicer. I used it a few times before I started to see real results. I really hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this product.</li>
    <li> This product did not work well. My hair looked the same as always. I also happened to find it at cvs for one third of the price--thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> My hair looked to be in good condition although thinning.  But once I tried this?  It sucked all the life out of my hair and left it dry and so horribly damaged that I am still trying to make it look better.  I only used it twice and that was a few weeks ago.  Now my hair just sticks out all over and is a dry, horrible mess.  It didn&#x27;t add a lick of volume either.  If anything, it made it look even more thin.</li>
    <li> I liked this shampoo.  My hair felt thick and soft and fluffy. It seemed to add volume to my hair.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that lacks volume. I purchased this shampoo with the conditioner and used for a few weeks. I found that the shampoo and conditioner actually left my hair looking flatter than before. So then I purchased the 3 week volume filler product to see if that made a difference. I used it for three weeks and only saw a minimal difference in volume. After about 4 weeks of using all three of the products, I have to say there is absolutely no point to this shampoo and conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t have the slightest difference on your hair unless you use the other products with it. And even then, the results were not at all impressive. So what is even the point of this product if you have to use all of its counterparts to even see a difference?? I will probably just throw the rest out since it doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> this really does make you feel and look like if your hair was thicker</li>
    <li> Huge disappointment.  Does nothing to add volume.  Leaves hair too soft and flat.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Have only used this about  4 times, but I can tell a slight difference in the thickness of my hair. Think it will just take time to be able to see it. I will continue to use this and will probably order more.</li>
    <li> It is an ok shampoo, but it didn&#x27;t do much for my baby fine silky hair, :D ... However, if you get it in your eyes, it HURTs like heck! I was very sadly surprised that this shampoo would do this. If you use it be very careful NOT to get any in your eyes. I would NOT recommend this for use on children! I would expect better from this company.</li>
    <li> Nothing to brag about. A bit too moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This shampoo did not change the appearance or texture of our hair.  My hair has always been baby fine and my husband is losing a bit of hair as he ages.  While it didn&#x27;t do what it promised, I still enjoyed the shampoo.  It lathered well, left my hair squeaky clean and had a pleasant mild fragrance.  Since the price was about the same as I would normally pay, I can&#x27;t feel too disappointed.  Too bad it didn&#x27;t seem to thicken our hair, but I would probably buy it again anyway. I&#x27;d give it three and one-half stars if I could.</li>
    <li> This shampoo performs better than $49-per-liter shampoos that I&#x27;ve used. It definitely makes my hair appear thicker -- even if used by itself -- without the companion gel and conditioner. I&#x27;m basing that on the fact that when I began using it along with the conditioner and the gel, it made my hair appear even thicker than when I used just the conditioner and the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using just the gel, which works great. And then I began using the conditioner, too. Combined, they made my hair appear even thicker and fuller, with more body. Later I purchased the shampoo and WOW! Go, Granny! (I&#x27;m almost 70.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t be without ANY of these products. My hair definitely looks and feels thicker and softer, and it has more body. Plus the overall health of my hair has undoubtedly improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION: Don&#x27;t use heavy hair dressings when using these products. They will only weigh your hair down, cancelling the thickening effects of these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I do to get great results:&lt;br /&gt;I shampoo, condition, and towel dry my hair. Then I work a small amount of Loreal&#x27;s thickening gel through the thinnest areas of my hair and comb through. You don&#x27;t need much of the gel; it will only dry out your hair and leave it dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then massage Hollywood Beauty Olive Oil into my scalp. I then mix a tiny bit of d:fi heavy wax and a small amount of Hollywood Beauty Castor Oil in my hand and work it through my hair. Then I blow dry my hair using a wide-tooth comb. Then I use the flat iron and I&#x27;m done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leaves my hair shiny, soft, thicker appearing and full of body. I am very happy with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: My background is mixed (African-American, Irish, and Indian). My hair is curly but not kinky. If your hair is kinky, you may have to use more Castor Oil and perhaps a wee bit more d:fi hair wax. But don&#x27;t overdo either; it will have negative effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Buy this great thickening shampoo. It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found -- at ANY price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The longer I use this shampoo and its companion products the better my hair looks and feels. Gotta love THAT.

    <li> I love this product and everything about it. From the first shampoo to after 3 wks of use I can see an overall improvement on my hair. It feels healthier, looks shinier, and fluffier (I have wavy curly red dyed hair. ) I used the conditioner and the 3 week treatment along with this and will most likely be buying another set when I run out.  It does increase volume and smells amazing! I highly recommend to use these products in tandem because you will not be disappointed. On another note In past reviews I&#x27;ve seen on YouTube and read I noticed most ppl who mixed this with a different brand did not have good results. Use all 3! Shampoo, conditioner, and 3 week treatment.</li>
    <li> This product really works</li>
    <li> I was not happy when I got it in my eyes, it HURT! Terribly! for a  long time.... also. I have used Aussie Volume and it does work, great! It thickens my hair and it stays hat way until I wash it again. So buy Aussie instead!</li>
    <li> I was amazed at the size of this product. I saw the ad on tv and thought I would try it as I like L&#x27;oreal hair products and make-up. My hair is getting thin and this was advertised as doubling the hair volume. After I tried it , I noticed right after drying my hair that it was so soft and felt thicker with just that one shampoo. As the day went on I found myself touching my hair and liking the way it felt. I am very happy that I decided to buy this product! My hair has never felt this good before or been so manageable. L&#x27;oreal has got a winner with this one!</li>
    <li> Other shampoo dried out hair. This shampoo leaves hair very soft and full. I have very straight hair with no body. Very good price.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase from Amazon of this shampoo. It adds a nice amount of volume, has pleasant odor and is reasonably priced.  I like the bottle shape, makes it easy to use in shower. I don&#x27;t know how much thicker it actually makes the hair strands, but it does definitely add volume to fine hair.</li>
