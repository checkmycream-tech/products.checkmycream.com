      <li>I just wished it got the finer hairs more often.</li>
      <li>i kinda felt though that because it was more of a \\&quot;softer\\&quot; wax that i had to keep applying, and applying it to get all the hairs.</li>
      <li>I bought this mostly as a test to see if I could wax myself.</li>
      <li>So glad I got this kit</li>
      <li>I love this kit save you tons of $$$$ doing it yourself</li>
      <li>Product arrived fast and it works great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to use and works great.  </li>
      <li>My skin comes out nice and clean.</li>
      <li>i felt comfortable handling it and felt it to be more comparable to the salon experience.</li>

      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>

      <li>I recommend using the strip type of wax or sugar wax that you can wash off easily.  </li>
      <li>I waxed my legs, thought I got off most of the wax, took a quick shower, then put on jeans to go somewhere.  </li>
      <li>If you want this product, just get the wax and cheap application sticks.  </li>

      <li>I did some research before buying this product and was pretty confident about it.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this product...</li>
      <li>The upside of THIS strip free wax however, is that it is more gentle to use.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it for my legs because it would run of quickly then</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s a lot more steady than I am and uses it for her eyebrows.  </li>
      <li>The jar for the wax was open, as in off the container and no seal of any kind.</li>
      <li>I applied the layer, no burn or sting, temp was just right.</li>
      <li>I read some reviews to try to get hints of how to do this right.</li>
      <li>It takes quite a bit of practice to get this right.  </li>
      <li>You also have to practice to get the right amount on</li>
      <li>so my body hair tends to be pretty light and not very thick.</li>
      <li>It was my first time waxing and everything went well</li>
      <li>The first place I tried this was the inside of my thigh where there was just a sparse patch of hair.</li>
      <li>so the process was pretty painless for me.</li>
      <li>I really love it for is the upper lip.  </li>
      <li>and i&#x27;m sure will last me 6 months.  </li>
      <li>The best part is that, after five years of using this wax every other week, my lip hair is much finer and there&#x27;s a lot less of</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t seem strong enough to try with bikini area</li>
      <li>/&gt;The extra bottles are not needed as you can easily take off any remaining wax with baby oil and get off as much as you can with the strips.</li>
      <li>The wax is also a reasonable size.</li>
      <li>but since I don&#x27;t want to pay exorbitant amounts of money to wax my legs, I&#x27;m going to try some cloth free systems for next time.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to buy a whole home waxing system with the warmer and whatnot</li>
      <li>This kit has saved me so much money</li>
      <li>My face looks clean and I only need to utilize the wax once every 3 or 4 weeks.</li>
      <li>but this makes it more possible because it only pulls the hair.</li>
      <li>This was my first time waxing at home and my second wax altogether (first was a Brazilian)</li>
      <li>Wonderful product....a little messy but what can you expect from wax!!</li>
      <li>I mainly use this for my lip and eyebrow</li>
      <li>it dries almost immediately after putting it on the skin, doesn&#x27;t mess much, and the pull off is quite easy.  </li>
      <li>This kit comes with a pre cleaner for the skin (liked it), an after wax cleaner for excess wax, a skin concealer &amp; a slow hair growth cream/serum.</li>
      <li>Clean up is super easy, no more sticky strips and even if the wax drips on me after a few moments for drying I can just peel it off.</li>
      <li>First hair had to be really long.</li>
      <li>I use it for that about once a month to keep things neat between professional waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but amazon fixed that for me.</li>
      <li>I tried a few more edges and the same thing.</li>
      <li>I personally prefer the other, its a thicker wax and uses strips...and because i feel comfortable waxing myself</li>
      <li>We tried the special lotion made for this product, don&#x27;t waste money, it&#x27;s just lotion.  </li>
      <li>I have course hair and very little plucking required for clean</li>
      <li>I am a natural blonde</li>

<li> I have course hair and very little plucking required for clean</li>
<li> I am a natural blonde</li>
<li> Only complaint is that it&#x27;s sticky and sticks very well to you.</li>
<li> but that&#x27;s to be expected especially since those hairs were short.</li>
<li> to dry then found and egde (strip-less) and ripped.</li>
<li> I ripped it off and it came off in bigger pieces but still pieces and left a few hairs behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> By the end of the day I noticed the little bits of wax actually left oil spots on my jeans.  </li>
<li> The tiny bits of wax left over are really hard to get off.  </li>
<li> When I got this two of the bottles inside had leaked everywhere and the lids were very loose.</li>
<li> and this gets almost all the hair, with me only having to tweeze a few.</li>
<li> not really.</li>
<li> hair removal is minimal... not buying again...</li>
<li> But after a few tries i learned to press down as much as possible with the stick as you apply it so that it can latch to the hairs.</li>
<li> We tried other kinds of lotion.  </li>
<li> The extra bottles are pointless.  </li>
<li> I would use this for small areas only.</li>
<li> I also had to microwave the wax for 15 seconds 5 other times because it kept hardening</li>
<li> It came when expected and works well!</li>
<li> A couple of the bottles were half empty.</li>
<li> With this hard wax, essentially any angle you start to peel from, you will always grab hair!</li>
<li> I have coarse thick hair I have to wax</li>
<li> This was a just mess.</li>
<li> Maybe once or twice did I actually mumble an &amp;#34;ow&amp;#34; but that was towards the end when I was getting lazy and applying the wax on too thick.</li>
<li> If you dribble it anywhere, it becomes one of those little bits of wax that stay on for days.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just a little to &#x27;liquid&#x27; for me to control.</li>
<li> It took me 30 min with their wax off wash to pick little pieces of gummy wax off my leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> 3 days later, the area that I did waxing on started to have small pimples!!</li>
<li> in all, the process was just too messy to ever do again at home</li>
<li> thought it was messy</li>
<li> We used witch hazel as an antiseptic (don&#x27;t waste money on the &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; prep), then dusted with baby powder before waxing.  </li>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy a whole home waxing system with the warmer and whatnot so I thought this kit would be great to try first. This was my first time waxing at home and my second wax altogether (first was a Brazilian) and I&#x27;d say it worked okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process of waxing both my legs took about 2 1/2 hours and I did it on my own. My pain threshold to waxing seems to be rather low so the process was pretty painless for me. Maybe once or twice did I actually mumble an &amp;#34;ow&amp;#34; but that was towards the end when I was getting lazy and applying the wax on too thick. I had to go over a few spots at least one more time towards the end to get all the hair off but that&#x27;s to be expected especially since those hairs were short. I also had to microwave the wax for 15 seconds 5 other times because it kept hardening and I figured I would need to since I didn&#x27;t have a warmer to keep it a stable temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra bottles are not needed as you can easily take off any remaining wax with baby oil and get off as much as you can with the strips. I&#x27;d say go for the wax only and buy some wax sticks and cloth elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the process was just too messy to ever do again at home but since I don&#x27;t want to pay exorbitant amounts of money to wax my legs, I&#x27;m going to try some cloth free systems for next time.</li>
    <li> I love this kit! It&#x27;s so easy to wax. I used to use the strip wax for my under arms &amp; I always had the issue of pulling the strip &amp; risking not grabbing any hair if I didn&#x27;t hold my skin taut. With this hard wax, essentially any angle you start to peel from, you will always grab hair! Clean up is super easy, no more sticky strips and even if the wax drips on me after a few moments for drying I can just peel it off. This kit comes with a pre cleaner for the skin (liked it), an after wax cleaner for excess wax, a skin concealer &amp; a slow hair growth cream/serum. The skin concealer is best suited for fair skin for redness. Definitely recommend for anyone who is tired of strip wax. So glad I got this kit, I&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
    <li> I ordered this wax after trying out my roommates gigi wax kit. Hers is with the strips, this one is \\&quot;strip free\\&quot; .  I personally prefer the other, its a thicker wax and uses strips...and because i feel comfortable waxing myself i felt comfortable handling it and felt it to be more comparable to the salon experience. The upside of THIS strip free wax however, is that it is more gentle to use. it dries almost immediately after putting it on the skin, doesn&#x27;t mess much, and the pull off is quite easy.  i kinda felt though that because it was more of a \\&quot;softer\\&quot; wax that i had to keep applying, and applying it to get all the hairs. WHere as with the strip kit you get one shot and you&#x27;re done.  But after a few tries i learned to press down as much as possible with the stick as you apply it so that it can latch to the hairs. I mainly use this for my lip and eyebrow and i&#x27;m sure will last me 6 months.  it doesn&#x27;t seem strong enough to try with bikini area but i will try that in the future.</li>
    <li> I probably won&#x27;t buy again. It hurts a ton and it was&lt;br /&gt;REALLY difficult to get off your legs. Use lots of baby oil to get it off after a couple days. Price was good though.</li>
    <li> This is probably one of my favorite things I have ever purchased off of Amazon. This kit has saved me so much money and it&#x27;s easy to use. My face looks clean and I only need to utilize the wax once every 3 or 4 weeks. I was so pleased I even bought one for my friend who has to wax every week and she loved it.</li>
    <li> I hate giving bad reviews but for this I just needed to let people know. I bought this mostly as a test to see if I could wax myself. This product was packaged very nice and the smell is of honey. The first place I tried this was the inside of my thigh where there was just a sparse patch of hair. NOTE: I am a natural blonde so my body hair tends to be pretty light and not very thick. I microwaved the wax according to directions and had no problems until application. I applied the layer, no burn or sting, temp was just right. I waited a min to dry then found and egde (strip-less) and ripped. Instead of the wax ripping off like it should, the wax was actually VERRY GUMMY. I tried a few more edges and the same thing. It took me 30 min with their wax off wash to pick little pieces of gummy wax off my leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I though &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; I did something wrong. I read some reviews to try to get hints of how to do this right. the next night, i applied some baby powder thinking it may help release the wax and I tried a tiny very thin layer to my arm. I ripped it off and it came off in bigger pieces but still pieces and left a few hairs behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third times a charm? not really. the next night after my shower i used the pre cleanser and then patted some baby powder on my armpits, cut up some strips because i read worked with those as well and I ripped! Nothin stuck to the strip and the wax gummed up like crazy and again, I sat in the bathroom pulling pieces of wax off hair. it was like plucking at that point because every piece only pulled up a couple hairs if at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong here, but overall this product is not for me and I won&#x27;t be purchasing strip-less was again!</li>
    <li> I always hate walking in to a nail salon to get my brows and chin waxed, no I can do it at home without the embarrassment.  And, you don&#x27;t need strips.  I&#x27;ve used this before and it works great.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product... when i did however it was a blah for me... it&#x27;s very messy... hair removal is minimal... not buying again...</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a stripless product. This was a just mess. The when I opened the box things seemed hinky from the get go. The jar for the wax was open, as in off the container and no seal of any kind. A couple of the bottles were half empty. When I tried to melt the wax it seemed to not want to melt. Solid as a rock when I poked it after heating it up as directed. I got frustrated and stabbed it with one of the application sticks and come to find out there was about a centimeter of hard wax and then the rest below had melted. I followed all the directions and it got to the point where I gave up and threw it out. Wasted money.</li>
    <li> It came when expected and works well!</li>
    <li> I love this kit save you tons of $$$$ doing it yourself</li>
    <li> Teenage daughter wanted it, she thought it was great .it thought it was messy</li>
    <li> I like it, keeps the unibrow gone for more than an week at a time!</li>
    <li> I did some research before buying this product and was pretty confident about it. It was my first time waxing and everything went well I guess. I did it on my face with some eyebrow area and my chin. It hurt a lot but not too bad. 3 days later, the area that I did waxing on started to have small pimples!! My face was a disaster.  It took 1 week for them to go down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if it&#x27;s the waxing or he post-waxing gel thing that came with the kit caused the problem. But I won&#x27;t try it again at all.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product....a little messy but what can you expect from wax!! Heats to the perfect consistancy and removes hair well without strips. I have course hair and very little plucking required for clean</li>
    <li> The extra bottles are pointless.  If you want this product, just get the wax and cheap application sticks.  It takes quite a bit of practice to get this right.  I recommend using the strip type of wax or sugar wax that you can wash off easily.  The tiny bits of wax left over are really hard to get off.  We tried the special lotion made for this product, don&#x27;t waste money, it&#x27;s just lotion.  We tried baby oil.  We tried other kinds of lotion.  We used witch hazel as an antiseptic (don&#x27;t waste money on the &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; prep), then dusted with baby powder before waxing.  The baby powder helps some, but the bits of wax left over stay on for days and stick to your clothing.  I waxed my legs, thought I got off most of the wax, took a quick shower, then put on jeans to go somewhere.  By the end of the day I noticed the little bits of wax actually left oil spots on my jeans.  This stuff does not dissolve with soap and water.  You also have to practice to get the right amount on so you do not cake it on and do not put too thin of a layer.  If you dribble it anywhere, it becomes one of those little bits of wax that stay on for days. You can get this product at Sally Beauty Supply for around the same price, and you can select from a variety of products to try out before you buy it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this wax! I was skeptical at first because I read some bad reviews but it worked perfectly for me.I did have some issues with the concealer being exploded when I got it but amazon fixed that for me. I have coarse thick hair I have to wax and this gets almost all the hair, with me only having to tweeze a few. It heats up easy and is a nice texture. The wax off isn&#x27;t the greatest for getting any extra residue off but everything else is great. I use to shave where there was hair but now I never will again. The wax is also a reasonable size. I wouldn&#x27;t use it for my legs because it would run of quickly then but for face it is perfect!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have been using this for about five years now and we both keep it on hand.  She&#x27;s a lot more steady than I am and uses it for her eyebrows.  I use it for that about once a month to keep things neat between professional waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really love it for is the upper lip.  It&#x27;s pretty easy to use and works great.  The best part is that, after five years of using this wax every other week, my lip hair is much finer and there&#x27;s a lot less of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s less painful than tweezers and faster.  It does take practice though, and I&#x27;ve never gotten the hang of the eyebrow sculpting.  It&#x27;s just a little to &#x27;liquid&#x27; for me to control.</li>
    <li> I just bought this and it worked well. Only complaint is that it&#x27;s sticky and sticks very well to you. Did the job though. I would use this for small areas only. But stronger wax for tougher jobs.</li>
    <li> I was not pleased with this item. First hair had to be really long. The hair I would have pulled with a homemade wax and strip was left when I used this product. I also had to reheat it twice during my initial use. I had some left wax so I saved it. In a couple of days I had more free time and decided to use it on the axillary area. Boy was that a mistake!!!! The wax did NOT harden on my armpit so I was left with all this wax that I could not remove!!! the wax remover did not help! I did not overheat the item any of the times I heated it...so beware! I&#x27;m not buying again, waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Product arrived fast and it works great. I know it&#x27;s bad to wax in the same place twice but this makes it more possible because it only pulls the hair. My skin comes out nice and clean. I just wished it got the finer hairs more often.</li>
    <li> When I got this two of the bottles inside had leaked everywhere and the lids were very loose.</li>
