      <li>Loved this one just as much.</li>
      <li>Goes on easily, and you don&#x27;t need to worry about it melting in your purse in warmer weather.</li>
      <li>Formula is fine, but I CANNOT stand the smell.</li>
      <li>This is a smooth application and helps keep your lips moist and free from chapping.  </li>
      <li>Palmer&#x27;s lip butter is a fantastic product.</li>
      <li>This stuff does a great job moisturizing my lips and has a nice chocolatey-minty flavor that is not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>Okay, so it is my own fault for not reading more carefully..</li>
      <li>IMO this is the greatest lip butter ever, especially for sensitive lips.</li>
      <li>It gives a nice clear gloss to your lips either by itself or over lipstick.  </li>
      <li>up,it is useful and cheap.</li>
      <li>Leaves my lips feeling smooth and takes care of dryness right away.</li>
      <li>Lucky for me.</li>
      <li>Super.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of this lip butter and it makes my lips very soft.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments about having pretty lips, &amp; what I use to keep them so soft &amp; moist!</li>
      <li>It has just the right amount of gloss.</li>
      <li>I had bought the Dark Chocolate &amp; Cherry Lip Butter flavor and loved it, so I thought I would try this flavor.  </li>
      <li>Palmer&#x27;s lip butter feels very light on the skin and has a nice subtle scent.</li>
      <li>Good Quality, smells just like dark choc and peppermint and really makes your lips shine.</li>
      <li>I will say that this particular application is definitely geared towards the more feminine as it&#x27;s glossy.</li>
      <li>Love this for dry lips.  </li>
      <li>But beware, the constant scent of peppermint patties might make you a little hungry lol</li>
      <li>Really like this lip butter.  </li>
      <li>Wish it was available locally</li>
      <li>It really stops the chapping.</li>
      <li>It is the real deal.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I have used everything under the sun to help prevent chapped lips - ever since using this stuff, my lips have never been so soft &amp; NO CHAPPING!!</li>
      <li>It gives a nice gloss without being too thick or shiny.</li>
      <li>It was everything I expected, kept my lips soft and moisturized throughout the day with a light scent.</li>
      <li>I love this product so much, that although I&#x27;m not able to find it in any of the drugstores around here anymore, that I&#x27;m about to order some from the internet!</li>
      <li>I applied the stuff liberally and my lips were super dry and flakey!</li>
      <li>Most lip balms or moisturizers just coat the lips and feel very heavy and sticky and they don&#x27;t stop the chapping or peeling.</li>
      <li>And it so hard to find I&#x27;m glad that I found it</li>
      <li>It goes on clear and the gloss isn&#x27;t overly shiny</li>
      <li>I wear it all the time and my lips are soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;fantastic product.</li>
      <li>Keeps lips moisturized a pretty long time.  </li>
      <li>When I put it on in the car my 3 year old will always say \\&quot;mmmm, I smell chocolate, mama!\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>Instead, I got one lonely tube in a large box.</li>
      <li>taste is lacking compared to dollar general brand</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried every lip product you can imagine and so far this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t hurt my lips and keeps them from getting chapped.  </li>
      <li>The shine doesn&#x27;t have that sticky pork chop grease appearance, it&#x27;s quite smooth and subtle.  </li>

    <li> Bets lip moisturizer there is out there.</li>
    <li> Very good product, have several times.</li>
    <li> I love this!! It has just the right amount of gloss. Palmer&#x27;s does not test on animals,and as an animal owner,this makes me very happy.The smell is wonderful,and is a perfect gift for my mom (who is very picky about what goes into the things she puts on her body, she researches everything) she had not one bad thing to say!!</li>
    <li> it tastes and smells like chocolate cocoa butter yumminess. I love kissing with this on. I wear it all the time and my lips are soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;fantastic product.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying your lip balm with this product.  Keeps lips moisturized a pretty long time.  Plus it has a little bit of shine to it.  Excellent price, excellent product!</li>
    <li> This lip butter is great!! I have used everything under the sun to help prevent chapped lips - ever since using this stuff, my lips have never been so soft &amp; NO CHAPPING!! I would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve tried. And I&#x27;ve tried plenty since I was a kid. Palmer&#x27;s lip butter is better than petrolium jelly, burt&#x27;s bees, chap stick, etc. It&#x27;s even better than the organic Badger balm.    Most lip balms or moisturizers just coat the lips and feel very heavy and sticky and they don&#x27;t stop the chapping or peeling. Palmer&#x27;s lip butter feels very light on the skin and has a nice subtle scent. It really stops the chapping.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for several years.  It gives a nice clear gloss to your lips either by itself or over lipstick.  Cannot find it in stores so am really glad to see it on Amazon.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My husband lives by this stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every lip product you can imagine and so far this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t hurt my lips and keeps them from getting chapped.  The shine doesn&#x27;t have that sticky pork chop grease appearance, it&#x27;s quite smooth and subtle.  IMO this is the greatest lip butter ever, especially for sensitive lips.</li>
    <li> This is the only lip balm that doesn&#x27;t give me an allergic reaction. I love it! It smells great and goes on smooth!</li>
    <li> Good degree of moisture，but smell a little terrible.I&#x27;d rather it has no smell.&lt;br /&gt;Sum up,it is useful and cheap.I can use it all winter.</li>
    <li> It is a clear gloss that smells delicious and feels great.  I am very impressed.  Definitely helped my dry cracked lips.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Thin and protective. Glides on easily and smells / tastes amazing. I will say that this particular application is definitely geared towards the more feminine as it&#x27;s glossy. Not just a sheen, but it is decidedly a gloss. Tingles a bit and lasts a long time. Buy a bunch so you always have one handy. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> My new favorite lip gloss!!  This stuff does a great job moisturizing my lips and has a nice chocolatey-minty flavor that is not overwhelming.  It&#x27;s just as nice to wear under lipstick as it is to wear alone.  It gives a nice gloss without being too thick or shiny.</li>
    <li> I was one of those poor souls who was addicted to the medicated lip balms because of severely dry and chapped lips. I decided it was time to wean myself off of the medicated addicting stuff, and I finally hit the jack pot when I found Palmer&#x27;s lip butter in chocolate peppermint. The peppermint added the little bit of coolness that I need to feel like it&#x27;s medicated, but not really medicated, you know? My husband and son love the scent of it! When I put it on in the car my 3 year old will always say \\&quot;mmmm, I smell chocolate, mama!\\&quot;  I love this product so much, that although I&#x27;m not able to find it in any of the drugstores around here anymore, that I&#x27;m about to order some from the internet!</li>
    <li> Formula is fine, but I CANNOT stand the smell. It gives me headache now.</li>
    <li> Palmer&#x27;s lip butter is a fantastic product. I get so many compliments about having pretty lips, &amp; what I use to keep them so soft &amp; moist! When the Walgreens in my area had they were closing out on this product, I purchased every tube they had!! I keep one in the car, my purse, &amp; at work!</li>
    <li> Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Lip Butter-Dark Chocolate &amp; Peppermint&lt;br /&gt;I love this And it so hard to find I&#x27;m glad that I found it hear.&lt;br /&gt;Thxs</li>
    <li> AWFUL! Smells rancid, is super greasy and tastes bad. Very fake choco mint. Take a pass.</li>
    <li> Super.  Tastes like I&#x27;ve just been eating chocolate, but without the calories.</li>
    <li> Best balm ever! Leaves my lips feeling smooth and takes care of dryness right away. Added bonus is the chocolate scent with just a hint of peppermint. Has a balm texture with just a hint of a glossy look.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and so easy to carry anywhere.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read the details closely (\\&quot;adds a subtle gloss\\&quot;) and ordered this for my husband&#x27;s stocking.  He&#x27;s a York Pppermint Patty addict. Lucky for me. It arrived, I realized I had goofed.  Yippeeee!  Great stuff, tasty, not greasy or waxy/</li>
    <li> Wish it was available locally but I guess I&#x27;ll just order as needed.  Love this product.  Hope it isn&#x27;t discontinued now that I&#x27;ve found it.</li>
    <li> Love this for dry lips.  Goes on easily, and you don&#x27;t need to worry about it melting in your purse in warmer weather.</li>
    <li> Such a great product, everything from Palmer&#x27;s is great. Good Quality, smells just like dark choc and peppermint and really makes your lips shine. You don&#x27;t need to glob it on, a little goes a LONG WAY. I wear it alone or over tinted lip balm. I WILL buy this again!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product but not anymore! I have been addicted to Chapstick for years but they all started to feel very heavy. I decided to give this a try and I am so happy I did. I absolutely love it. It is light, moisturizing, and the smell is amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a big fan of Palmer&#x27;s for years.  Nothing comes close to their quality, so now I can have the same for my lips.  The mild flavor of the chocolate and mint is amazing.  It goes on silky and truly conditions your lips.  Who wouldn&#x27;t want to kiss that?</li>
    <li> taste is lacking compared to dollar general brand</li>
    <li> Great product Great smell shine is awesome</li>
    <li> I love this product. It was everything I expected, kept my lips soft and moisturized throughout the day with a light scent. But beware, the constant scent of peppermint patties might make you a little hungry lol</li>
    <li> I had bought the Dark Chocolate &amp; Cherry Lip Butter flavor and loved it, so I thought I would try this flavor.  Loved this one just as much.</li>
    <li> Really like this lip butter.  The dark chocolate + peppermint is a subtle flavor and not artificial or overpowering.  This is a smooth application and helps keep your lips moist and free from chapping.  Would recommend!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great! It goes on clear and the gloss isn&#x27;t overly shiny, it looks very nice with or without lipstick. I don&#x27;t wear lipstick so I just go with it. It&#x27;s not too greasy or slimey or anything.</li>
    <li> Okay, so it is my own fault for not reading more carefully.. But I thought there were two of these guys like how the picture shows! Instead, I got one lonely tube in a large box. Sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, it is very great! I used this on a nightly basis, ran out, and bought some Carmex as a replacement since I couldn&#x27;t find Palmer&#x27;s at the store. Boy did I do wrong because it dried my lips out even MORE. I applied the stuff liberally and my lips were super dry and flakey! I had to come back to Palmer&#x27;s... It is the real deal. Smells delicious too :)</li>
    <li> My wife is allergic to lanolin, this works well without the lanolin</li>
    <li> I seriously stopped using lipstick now and just apply this gloss. It not over the top but still very sexy. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells and tasted great. Moisturizes lips vey well. And, I can leave it in my car without fear of it melting and leaking all over! I would give 5 stars, but they use some artificial ingredients I don&#x27;t like. But I knew that before purchasing...</li>
    <li> I used to be a fan of lip gloss years ago and I love palmers cocoa butter products so I decided to give this a try. It kinda dried my lips out and made them sticky so I only use it if I wear makeup...</li>
    <li> It is simply an amazing product. Will buy again! I use it all the time, nice smell to it too.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lip butter and it makes my lips very soft. I will defnitely buy this again. It&#x27;s like putting on a peppermint patty!</li>
