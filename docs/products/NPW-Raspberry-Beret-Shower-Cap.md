      <li>I bought the first one about five years ago at a book store, and it still works and looks great!</li>
      <li>but I could have kept it in better condition by not plucking it off her head from the stem!</li>
      <li>She is even able to get the stray hairs around her neck in the cap because is it a good size for her.  </li>

      <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>This is cute.</li>
      <li>Satisfied customer.</li>
      <li>I would playfully take this beret off my daughters head by lifting from the stem on top.</li>
      <li>My daughter will love it.</li>
      <li>Most importantly, it fit nicely on my four-year-olds head.</li>
      <li>It can make it challenging to outfit her sometimes.</li>
      <li>It is cute, but not as functional as I had hoped.</li>
      <li>My daughter liked it very much</li>
      <li>It looks very cute and works very well.</li>
      <li>Equally as important, she looks</li>
      <li>Never-the-less, I had a need to buy her a shower cap that would fit her head</li>
      <li>so it is more decor than useful for showers.</li>
      <li>Fits her comfortably.</li>
      <li>the way it should seems durable and not made of light cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>When I presented it to her she was extremely excited to have an opportunity to wear it.</li>
      <li>My daughter is so excited to wear it.</li>
      <li>It is manufactured with good materials and it has a solid construction.</li>
      <li>But for a quick shower, it does the trick.</li>
      <li>It is super durable.</li>
      <li>This item is very durable and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>most importantly, it fits head of child (4yr old)</li>
      <li>The second one is the same quality as the first, and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
      <li>Worked great on my daughters little head.</li>
      <li>I have a 4 year old daughter with better fashion sense than I have.</li>
      <li>My 19 month old daughter started to ask to wear it, and I was able to find it here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
      <li>I love the little raspberry stem on top and so does my husband.  </li>
      <li>My younger kids love this cap and it is not size restrictive.  </li>
      <li>Exactly.  </li>
      <li>Her grandchildren really got a kick out of this shower cap on their grandma!</li>
      <li>The top piece broke off after several use.</li>
      <li>I bought it for my 5 year old, who is more like a 6 year old in height/weight.</li>
      <li>Great quality, fits an adult head even though I don&#x27;t have a small head.</li>
      <li>If she were to only wear it around the hairline, it would be fine.  </li>
      <li>She always wants to put it on when she takes her bath or shower.</li>
      <li>I plan on buying more to keep on hand for a quick non expensive gift that everyone would love to use and get a laugh at the same time!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this cap as it is well constructed and very durable.  </li>
      <li>It says one size fits most and I have a pretty small head</li>
      <li>colour is vibrant.</li>
      <li>This cap is too large for 5 year old kid</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a small female adult,(with a small head) and this is the only shower cap I&#x27;ve ever had that fit my head perfectly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick and does the trick.</li>
      <li>It looks adorable, but I wish it weren&#x27;t so stiff.</li>
      <li>We wash her hair every other day, and this cap does a great job of keeping her hair dry, and therefore, less frizzy after her shower.    </li>
      <li>I bought this for my 4 yr old daughter.</li>
      <li>My 5 year old daughter loves it.</li>
      <li>An adult could wear it not that I ever have.</li>
      <li>How many pink raspberries with black seeds</li>
      <li>and she still uses it new (2 years later)</li>
      <li>as the title says, you will get your desired objective here but due to the smallish nature of it, it will be a tight fit for anyone older then a young toddler</li>
      <li>I can easily see this lasting for a few years and I strongly recommend it for any other parents looking to purchase a shower cap for their little girl!  </li>
      <li>Bought for my tiny 4 year old.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty tight.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick enough that you can clean it with a scrubber brush and soap when it needs to be freshened up.</li>
      <li>but it is tight &amp; certainly keeps the water off my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As mentioned in other reviews, the very nicely applied elastic is a little tight, but then, I have a small head.  </li>

<li> The elastic is very thick/too tight (I have an average size head)</li>

<li> It protects her long hair in the shower.</li>

<li> This one  stays on without being too tight, or too loose.</li>
<li> All others I&#x27;ve bought in the past were too big, and would slide down over my eyebrows.</li>
<li> The elastic is too tight on her.</li>
<li> Kid loves it and it hasn&#x27;t become moldy like previous caps after a few months of use.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s a little snug.</li>
<li> After a few times of doing that it came off.</li>
<li> And it is too small on her.</li>
<li> However, it seems to run small.</li>
<li> recommend this for people with small heads.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I needed a shower cap that wasn&#x27;t really expensive. This is cute. It says one size fits most and I have a pretty small head and it&#x27;s a little snug. But for a quick shower, it does the trick.</li>
    <li> Nice, durable quality. However, it seems to run small. I bought it for my 5 year old, who is more like a 6 year old in height/weight. If she were to only wear it around the hairline, it would be fine.  But it is a stretch to have it cover her ears and she doesn&#x27;t like it.  It&#x27;s pretty tight.  I&#x27;m trying to stretch it out.</li>
    <li> Bought for my tiny 4 year old. It looks big on her but is the only one we&#x27;ve found that actually keeps her hair dry! Good quality and fun design that my daughter loves!</li>
    <li> So cute!! Daughter loves it!!!</li>
    <li> Although the cap is a bit bigger for my 3 y.o daughter, it serves the purpose. It protects her long hair in the shower.</li>
    <li> Um, hello? Who ever named this cap must go back to kindergarten and learn their fruits.  This shower cap is OBVIOUSLY a strawberry.  How many pink raspberries with black seeds do you know? Exactly.  Other than that, I like it.  I have a small head and it does the trick.  I feel that it will also stretch with time.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected.  I bought it for an average size domed adult friend and it was too small.  Great for kids though!</li>
    <li> This shower cap is REALLY thick, and smells like factory plastic. But it is really cute, and fairly functional. Because it&#x27;s so thick though, it sits kind of uncomfortable and loose on my head. So beware of that.</li>
    <li> This items fits my 2 year old daughter&#x27;s head perfectly. Good quality and very cute. She really liked it. Satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a small female adult,(with a small head) and this is the only shower cap I&#x27;ve ever had that fit my head perfectly. All others I&#x27;ve bought in the past were too big, and would slide down over my eyebrows. This one  stays on without being too tight, or too loose.</li>
    <li> The elastic is very thick/too tight (I have an average size head) and it is impossible for me to cover all of my hair. It is cute, but not as functional as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> I have a 4 year old daughter with better fashion sense than I have. It can make it challenging to outfit her sometimes. Never-the-less, I had a need to buy her a shower cap that would fit her head and I immediately was drawn to this one. When I presented it to her she was extremely excited to have an opportunity to wear it. It is manufactured with good materials and it has a solid construction. Nothing flimsy here. Most importantly, it fit nicely on my four-year-olds head. Very important for bath time. I can easily see this lasting for a few years and I strongly recommend it for any other parents looking to purchase a shower cap for their little girl!  One note on this product. I would playfully take this beret off my daughters head by lifting from the stem on top. After a few times of doing that it came off. There weren&#x27;t any holes or anything and she still uses it new (2 years later) but I could have kept it in better condition by not plucking it off her head from the stem!</li>
    <li> It looks very cute and works very well. My daughter is so excited to wear it. It&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
    <li> It got thight at my daughter&#x27;s head but she lives it anyway.</li>
    <li> as the title says, you will get your desired objective here but due to the smallish nature of it, it will be a tight fit for anyone older then a young toddler</li>
    <li> My younger kids love this cap and it is not size restrictive.  An adult could wear it not that I ever have.</li>
    <li> It looks adorable, but I wish it weren&#x27;t so stiff. My child wouldn&#x27;t wear it after a couple of times.</li>
    <li> most importantly, it fits head of child (4yr old) the way it should seems durable and not made of light cheap plastic. colour is vibrant.</li>
    <li> I am finally throwing this away after over 4 years of use! It is super durable. The elastic finally gave out. It&#x27;s thick enough that you can clean it with a scrubber brush and soap when it needs to be freshened up.</li>
    <li> Great shower cap. My 5 year old daughter loves it. Fits her comfortably.</li>
    <li> This shower cap fits my head...it indeed looks like a strawberry so it is more decor than useful for showers. The reason for that is the material of the shower cap. It is very thick &amp; stiff. It is very hard to get the ears out....but it is tight &amp; certainly keeps the water off my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for people with small heads.</li>
    <li> Love the shower cap!! I plan on buying more to keep on hand for a quick non expensive gift that everyone would love to use and get a laugh at the same time!</li>
    <li> LOVE this cap. It&#x27;s nice and thick and does the trick. Worked great on my daughters little head.</li>
    <li> My daughter liked it very much</li>
    <li> Our daughter loves it. We ordered another one for gift. This item is very durable and easy to clean. Works well in shower.</li>
    <li> I know this shower cap is for children, but I have a small head, so I bought it for myself.  It is the sturdiest, most well made shower cap I have ever seen.  As mentioned in other reviews, the very nicely applied elastic is a little tight, but then, I have a small head.  I love the little raspberry stem on top and so does my husband.  It cracks him up when I wear it.</li>
    <li> This cap is too large for 5 year old kid and I think the cap is good for adults. The top piece broke off after several use.</li>
    <li> Kid loves it and it hasn&#x27;t become moldy like previous caps after a few months of use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for our son to use when he wanted to take a shower so he doesn&#x27;t get his hair all wet.  The shower cap is very thick and sturdy.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I got this shower cap for my daughter and she loves it. She always wants to put it on when she takes her bath or shower. It holds up well as I have used it daily for the past several months.</li>
    <li> I now own two of these shower caps! I bought the first one about five years ago at a book store, and it still works and looks great! My 19 month old daughter started to ask to wear it, and I was able to find it here on Amazon. The second one is the same quality as the first, and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This shower cap is sooooooo cute. I bought it for my sister but of course I tried it on before I gave it to her. It was for her 70th birthday. Her grandchildren really got a kick out of this shower cap on their grandma! Very cute and good quality! Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this cap as it is well constructed and very durable.  My 2nd grade daughter loves wearing this cap in the shower.  We wash her hair every other day, and this cap does a great job of keeping her hair dry, and therefore, less frizzy after her shower.    She is able to and enjoys putting the cap on by herself.  She is even able to get the stray hairs around her neck in the cap because is it a good size for her.  Equally as important, she looks oh so cute cute wearing the cap (I still need to take the Show-Your-Friends-When-You-Are-a-Teenager photo).</li>
    <li> Very cute. My daughter will love it. The packaging was a mess and missing parts, but since it is going in a stocking, that is not too critical.</li>
    <li> Great quality, fits an adult head even though I don&#x27;t have a small head. I just love it, perfect!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 4 yr old daughter. And it is too small on her. The elastic is too tight on her.</li>
