      <li>Sometime, when I use separate moisturizers, I&#x27;ve noticed that they seem to irritate my eyes significantly, which makes me think that my customers/teammates think I&#x27;m on drugs.</li>

      <li>While I really like these makeup remover wipes and couldn&#x27;t tell a huge difference between them and neutragena wipes for the price.</li>
      <li>They work ok in removing make up, but they are not as soft.  </li>
      <li>I keep a packet in my makeup bag if I&#x27;m feeling grimy and want to start fresh, but don&#x27;t have time to go home.</li>

      <li>Really works well...</li>
      <li>You can really tell the difference.  </li>
      <li>Fast forward to the post purchase of these wipes - which by the way were an impulse purchase.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t very moist.</li>
      <li>In combination with the other Boots products that I am using (the Intense Serum, the tinted moisturizer and the foaming cleanser), I now have skin that I love.</li>
      <li>have to be super careful about what products I use as I have mild adult acne and super sensitive skin around my eyes.</li>
      <li>Although, it&#x27;s suppose to be fragrance free, there is a slight fresh scent.</li>
      <li>Just okay, wipes are a bit on the dry side, so I have to wipe a bit firmer than I&#x27;d like on my sensitive face.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re more than enough moisture and my pores seems smaller on my nose.</li>
      <li>While on the road recently, out of desperation the other day I grabbed another kind of wipe</li>
      <li>They are strong and don&#x27;t rip like the other ones.</li>
      <li>I like Make up remover products that are gentle because I have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Not the case with these lovely little clothes!   </li>
      <li>Using these wipes, my skin tone improved, it really faded some of my more epic acne scars, I still get random spots but don&#x27;t really full on break out, and my face just looks brighter and healthier.</li>
      <li>I mean a 4 in 1 for someone with an admittedly lazy pre-bedtime facial routine just seemed perfect.</li>
      <li>I also use these for a little light moisture all over my body</li>
      <li>handy to have around, but a little rough on sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I travel a lot for work and have olive toned, combination skin that isn&#x27;t sensitive or acne prone.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin refreshed and soft and removes all make-up from the day.</li>
      <li>My skin is fairly sensitive and</li>
      <li>Will not irritate and will hydrate enough that you won&#x27;t harm combination skin or risk drying out too much that you&#x27;ll encourage wrinkles.</li>
      <li>Or if I&#x27;m pulling an unexpected overnighter and am not prepared.</li>
      <li>An adult like me with acne?</li>
      <li>I broke out even though this brand was recommended for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It is good for nights that you are too tired to play around your face!</li>
      <li>With these wipes my skin is very lightly moisturized after use and doesn&#x27;t have that tight and dry feeling.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> takes makeup off fast and leaves your skin feeling clean and soft</li>
    <li> After hearing so many rave reviews about Boots products, I bought a few things from their line when I hit up a Target about a month and a half ago. My skin is fairly sensitive and many products I&#x27;ve bought have either ended up in the back of the cabinet or in the trash. I&#x27;ve had some other facial wipes that I&#x27;ve used - but I&#x27;ve always felt with either their fragrance or the actual cleanser on them that I&#x27;ve had to wash my face or rinse it after using them. Not the case with these lovely little clothes!   I wear makeup everyday. I wear eyeliner and mascara - blush, lipstick, the whole nine. But I was never very good about taking it off at night time. I would sleep with it all on and deal with it in the morning. I would occasionally have a few breakouts around the time of my period or one or two here or there. After time, I was noticing that I had some small (very small) blackheads around the sides of my nose or some small bumps on my chin area.   Fast forward to the post purchase of these wipes - which by the way were an impulse purchase. I started using them without thinking that I would see any difference  - because I had them I thought that I should start to use them. After a few weeks, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! The clarity of my skin is remarkable. All of those little spots are gone and my skin is amazing! I could easily go without any makeup.   In combination with the other Boots products that I am using (the Intense Serum, the tinted moisturizer and the foaming cleanser), I now have skin that I love. My struggle to bring myself to wash my face at the end of the day is now \\&quot;A Must Do.\\&quot;    Love, love, love these!</li>
    <li> I randomly picked up a pack or these late 2009 instead of my regular Olay ones out of curiosity. I mean a 4 in 1 for someone with an admittedly lazy pre-bedtime facial routine just seemed perfect. And it was. And it has continued to be. I was only just beginning to escape and win the acne battle brought on by puberty and battling oily skin in my T Zone. Using these wipes, my skin tone improved, it really faded some of my more epic acne scars, I still get random spots but don&#x27;t really full on break out, and my face just looks brighter and healthier. Pair this with a good face scrub for mornings and I&#x27;ve essentially stopped wearing make up to hide my face, because there&#x27;s nothing to hide.</li>
    <li> As good as any of the higher priced brands and leaves your face fresh and clean. Good value.</li>
    <li> handy to have around, but a little rough on sensitive skin.  I would not recommend for removing eye makeup.</li>
    <li> I purchased these at a big red MN-based bullseye retailer for around $5. I&#x27;m reviewing for only the product, which is spectacular! I travel a lot for work and have olive toned, combination skin that isn&#x27;t sensitive or acne prone. Sometime, when I use separate moisturizers, I&#x27;ve noticed that they seem to irritate my eyes significantly, which makes me think that my customers/teammates think I&#x27;m on drugs. When on the road, I wash/use product only before bed. In the AM, I shower, shave, rinse and then use these. They&#x27;re more than enough moisture and my pores seems smaller on my nose. I also use these for a little light moisture all over my body bc the cloth is wet enough for face, neck, back, elbows, knees, etc. I really do like these a lot and would gladly recommend to others, especially for men who want something super quick and easy!!</li>
    <li> Really works well...even with waterproof mascara!  Glad I tried it!</li>
    <li> These wipettes are my favorite. They&#x27;re gentle but they remove all makeup and my skin does not feel dried out after using them. I keep a packet in my makeup bag if I&#x27;m feeling grimy and want to start fresh, but don&#x27;t have time to go home. Or if I&#x27;m pulling an unexpected overnighter and am not prepared. They&#x27;re a great little resource. I used to use Neutrogena facial wipes but they always left my skin sticky and extremely dry, which caused little patches of breakouts overnight. I have no problems with these at all.     A hint, though - if you just remember to pick them up at Ulta or Target, it will cost you five dollars. If you order it online, it by itself will be ten dollars plus shipping. Not worth ordering unless you don&#x27;t have access to them at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> Always in my gym bag. Removes everything and not drying.</li>
    <li> Face feels really clean.  Does what it says.</li>
    <li> Just okay, wipes are a bit on the dry side, so I have to wipe a bit firmer than I&#x27;d like on my sensitive face. Will use them to wipe my sink in between cleaning days instead.</li>
    <li> Target no longer carried these wipes (their package was blue but the same description) so I got these. They work ok in removing make up, but they are not as soft.  Guess they changed the formula for some reason, but I used about 5 and then tossed them.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the only one of these sorts of products you should ever use, and I&#x27;ve used some pretty impressive Japanese Biore. Rub it on your eyes and marvel as you do not flinch! Remove makeup in a flash! On a plane and feeling a little dry, dirty and oily? Wipe this on your face and feel rejuvenated. Someone spilled something on their clothes? This is wetter than most of these sorts of products, and you can hand them with confidence something better than a wet-nap. Feeling a little uncomfortable and less than fresh during your time of the month in a bathroom stall? It&#x27;s sensitive enough to even take care of that. An adult like me with acne? No problem. Will not irritate and will hydrate enough that you won&#x27;t harm combination skin or risk drying out too much that you&#x27;ll encourage wrinkles. Need to pack a small back for an overnight at a hotel? This should be just fine as your sole cleaner for the trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How could you ever use anything else?</li>
    <li> You can really tell the difference.  For aging boomers, this is a great skin product.  You will see the difference after a week or so.</li>
    <li> Took off all makeup including waterproof mascara quickly</li>
    <li> I love these wipes. They are gentle but do a good job of removing make up.</li>
    <li> It is an easy to use product and cleans as they promise, but when gets to cleaning the mascara from lashes, I lose too many lashes and pimples here and there. It is good for nights that you are too tired to play around your face!</li>
    <li> These are the BEST makeup remover wipes out there. Seriously. They are strong and don&#x27;t rip like the other ones. They take off waterproof mascara no problem and lip stains. It also moisturizes your face! BEST EVER. HOWEVER, they are cheaper at target.</li>
    <li> These are great for taking makeup off at the end of the day. No strong smell, not oily. Removes even waterproof makeup. Good price too. Love them!</li>
    <li> I love  Boots and # 7 Products!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Very quick and easy especially when in a hurry.  Leaves skin refreshed and soft and removes all make-up from the day.</li>
    <li> item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
    <li> These leave my skin feeling clean and not sticky.  Very handy when out late and can&#x27;t wait to get makeup off.</li>
    <li> Not fit for my face. I broke out even though this brand was recommended for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great product. Very effective in clearing away makeup, especially at night when I don&#x27;t feel like using my&lt;br /&gt;Clearisonic. Also, no worries about waterproof makeup. No more racoon eyes in the morning. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great makup remover wipes. Easy to carry and no yucky film on your face.</li>
    <li> These wipes are fabulous!  They are nice and soft and soothing.  I buy several packs at a time so I don&#x27;t run out.  They work well, are moisturizing, and don&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out or dry out.  My face doesn&#x27;t sting like it does when I use the Neutrogena wipes.  My daughter loves them too.  They are great to clean your face when you don&#x27;t feel like making a mess of your clothing with soap or cleanser and water.  They remove what little makeup I wear fairly well, although mascara takes a bit of effort.  Boots is a well-known pharmacy chain in Britain.  I use their Protect and Defend line as well.</li>
    <li> this is about the only cleaner that I have found that actually does what it says.</li>
    <li> These are really good facial wipes and not expensive. Wish Walmart had them because we don&#x27;t have a Target close to us. Kathy</li>
    <li> Best makeup wipes on the market</li>
    <li> Love these for when I&#x27;m in a hurry or traveling.</li>
    <li> Have been using these for years.  They are easy on the face and great for removing make-up.</li>
    <li> These wipes are miraculous! Off in a flash.....</li>
    <li> I bought these as soon as CVS started carrying Boots products. I read about them in a magazine and thought what a great idea to have a 4-in-1 product. The cloths are soft and moist enough to do a thorough job of removing makeup. The only gripe I have with this wipe and all wipes  I&#x27;ve tried that claim they remove waterproof mascara is that it doesn&#x27;t take it off, at least not easily or completely. Maybe with one coat of mascara but not 2 coats. So I still buy a separate mascara remover. OTherwise regular mascara comes off like magic. In the winter I sometimes have to dab some moisturizer on my dry spots during the day, and I use a night cream at night. But the fact that there is no fragrance means most people won&#x27;t have a problem with dry skin. Quite frankly, I don&#x27;t think there should be fragrance in any facial product. I love the Boots line, and this is now one of my staples.</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t very moist. I still have to use a wet washcloth to finish getting my makeup off.</li>
    <li> I like Make up remover products that are gentle because I have sensitive skin.  This was nice and did the job&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping great product I am very happy thank you Joanann</li>
    <li> I CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE I FOUND SOMETHING THAT IS GETTING RID OF MY BLACK HEADS .. AFTER TRYING EVERYTHING !! AND I DO MEAN EVERYTHING !! FROM $80 STUFF TO $5 STUFF AND THIS IS JUST THE BEST .. OTHER WIPES GAVE ME EVEN MORE BLACK HEADS ..NOT THIS ONE .. SLOWLY BUT SURLEY MY FACE IS CLEARING UP AND SMOOTHING OUT ... I GOT THIS AS A LAST MINUTE AFTER THE SALES MAN RAVED ABOUT IT .. I WAS SKEPTICAL BUT THEN FOR $10 FOR 2 I COULD NOT GO WRONG .. AND I CAN&#x27;T EVEN BELIEVE HOW WELL THEY ARE WORKING FOR ME .. I HAVE A SUPER LAZY NIGHT RITUAL.. IM IN MY LATE 20&#x27;S AND I KNOW I NEED TO WASH MY FACE BETTER AS WELL AS USE THE NIGHT CREAM THIS TAKES CARE OF IT ALL .. I EVEN TRIED A TONER THAT WAS A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE AND PEOPLE RAVED ABOUT WITH OUT ANY RESULTS .. THIS IS THE BEST .. COMBINE THIS WITH THE DAY OR NIGHT CREME AND YOUR SET !!!</li>
    <li> While I really like these makeup remover wipes and couldn&#x27;t tell a huge difference between them and neutragena wipes for the price.</li>
    <li> This wipes are fragrance free and do a great job removing my makeup.</li>
    <li> They do a very good job getting all my make up off</li>
    <li> These wipes are great!! Although, it&#x27;s suppose to be fragrance free, there is a slight fresh scent. Most wipes only come in 25 per package. There are 30 with these which I think is a better deal!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Review by Tom&#x27;s Chu&#x27;s wife.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s and have combination skin I am often guilty of trying to make excuses at night why I &#x27;can&#x27;t&#x27; wash my face before bed. But I love these wipes. I keep a pack in my nightstand and a pack in the bathroom. They&#x27;re effective and truly an all-in-one product. I recommend these to everyone, especially those who have bouts of laziness or are just busy in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to be super careful about what products I use as I have mild adult acne and super sensitive skin around my eyes. This product does not irritate my skin or cause break-outs like some other all-in-one wipes. It doesn&#x27;t have any actual anti-acne properties in it, but I definitely have noticed that my breakouts are less since I&#x27;ve started using the wipes; which I think just comes from having clean and lightly moisturized skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With other products, usually my eyes hurt after using them to remove make-up but not with the No. 7 wipes, I&#x27;ve even accidentally gotten the wipes in my eye and it didn&#x27;t even hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a littler leery to try the No. 7 wipes since I figured they would just be a more expensive version of the wipes I had tried before. But now that I&#x27;ve started using them, I don&#x27;t want to switch back. While on the road recently, out of desperation the other day I grabbed another kind of wipe (Say Yes To Soothing Cucumber) that was similarly priced, I could tell instantly that they weren&#x27;t the quality of the No. 7 wipes as they left my skin tight, dry and a little sticky. With these wipes my skin is very lightly moisturized after use and doesn&#x27;t have that tight and dry feeling. I have never had to use more than one wipe no matter how much make-up I have caked on. I feel silly raving about a make-up wipe, but I LOVE THESE 4-in-1 wipes!</li>
