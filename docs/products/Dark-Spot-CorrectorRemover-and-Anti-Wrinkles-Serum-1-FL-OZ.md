      <li>I had been using this serum for over 2 months (I bought 2 bottles as the reviews were very good), but no changes at all that I can see on my skin.</li>
      <li>Thank you for this great product.</li>

      <li>I usually prefer to use the most popular products to attain the most flawless results.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, a serum is the most important part of any skincare regime.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I received a complimentary Wonderpiel Vitamin C Serum in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I strongly suggest being diligent about sun screen.</li>
      <li>I saw no difference in my complexion, fine lines, etc.</li>
      <li>and I got it with a huge discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I loved the soft touch of my face which the Vitamin C extracts gave me.</li>
      <li>but so worth it!</li>
      <li>Love it my skin looks so much brighter and smoother!</li>
      <li>With aging we must take steps to revive the skin and looking a great as we can afford the Dark Sport Corrector is great and can bring the look that you wish with regular use for that result.&lt;br</li>
      <li>me know that the company has spent time to give you a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>C is a tried and true skin rejuvenator.</li>
      <li>I also have sensitive skin, easily developing reactions to many products.</li>
      <li>Since most day creams have sun protection of 15% or above, using your favorite day cream after the serum is fine.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>It is pricey but so worth it.</li>
      <li>When I ran out, I tried to use up my old serum before replacing with more Wonderpiel.  </li>
      <li>Recently someone told me that I look really good and that I&#x27;m even looking younger!!!  :-)  </li>
      <li>The company stays in touch if you have any questions they are right there to guide you.</li>
      <li>I honestly recommend it to all women who wants to feel younger skin on their face again!</li>
      <li>Thanks for the product; by the way the price is very reasonable too!</li>
      <li>I will most definitely share mine once there is something to share.</li>
      <li>The age spots have lightened and I can only hope that with longer and continued use, it will all even out giving a lovely, youthful glow.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product; it truly does as promised!  </li>
      <li>I can apply makeup within 4 min, which I really like!  </li>
      <li>I have spent so much money on skincare products and most did nothing spectacular to make my skin feel or appear any younger.</li>
      <li>It was good, but I wanted something different; something that could also give my face a younger look.</li>
      <li>This product works amazing at getting out dark spots.</li>
      <li>Wonderpiel serum is a very promising new product in the skin care market and I look forward to writing an update on how it is keeping its promise to me!</li>
      <li>I used the whole bottle before I decided to write a review.</li>
      <li>Luckily enough, I was given a chance to try Wonderpiel for free.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week, but my skin feels sooo smooth.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>Thanks Jill</li>
      <li>I put off writing a review for almost a month because I really wanted a chance to try this product out.</li>
      <li>I really like this and will purchase again.</li>
      <li>and I am really seeing a difference.  </li>
      <li>I was using some other serum for many months.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a new product for me, I purchased it based on the positive comments.</li>
      <li>The seller is so sweet and helpful for questions I had about my order and went above and beyond my expectation!!  </li>
      <li>But after the first day yet alone the first week of using this product I&#x27;m simply amazed!</li>
      <li>I will most likely order something comparable next time and will not be ordering this product again.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it</li>
      <li>I had high expectations, I guess, but it did not work for me.</li>
      <li>I have been looking forward to trying a hyaluronic serum and have set my expectations high.  </li>
      <li>In fact I wear sunscreen on my face every day and even noticed a few more spots showing up on my face.</li>
      <li>But this serum is a nice thick serum that goes on without any stickiness and residue.</li>
      <li>skin seems more healthy and toned, and the small lines around eyes and mouth are beginning to disappear after a few days of using it twice a day.</li>
      <li>In fact, this new bottle looks and feels like cloudy water.  </li>
      <li>I have been disappointed by claims from other manufacturers that theirs is the best anti-wrinkle serum that reduces fine lines, blah-blah-blah…they were not.  </li>
      <li>The fine lines and dark spots started to reduce.</li>
      <li>Not pleased with this finding at all and will be returning this latest purchase.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t my first experience on amazon, but this serum totally changed my skin.</li>
      <li>Will review later if they continue to fad towards the end of my first bottle.</li>
      <li>I compared the list of ingredients on the first bottle to the one I currently have.</li>
      <li>It takes a while to be thoroughly absorbed so allow ample time for it to dry before applying moisturizer or make up.  </li>
      <li>I live in an area with sunny weather most of the year, and well into the 100&#x27;s for at least 4 months.</li>
      <li>and it really helped to smooth out a slight blotchy area left by the peel.</li>
      <li>It did clear my face up</li>
      <li>I AM A 58YR OLD WOMEN OF COLOR.  </li>
      <li>I like this product so far.</li>
      <li>I was very spectacle when deciding on whether or not to purchase this, especially for the price!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have only used this for about three days and I am really seeing a difference.  I also use it on the backs of my hands.  I had a medium peel awhile back and it really helped to smooth out a slight blotchy area left by the peel. Love this product and the results are amazing. The company stays in touch if you have any questions they are right there to guide you.</li>
    <li> I am using as advised for a month for dark spots but no improvement at all...I do not recommend this product...</li>
    <li> I give it only 3 until I see the results...will &#x27;repost after I use it for an extended period.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t do anything at all !! Dissatisfied !!</li>
    <li> So far no visible results</li>
    <li> I was very spectacle when deciding on whether or not to purchase this, especially for the price! But oh my am I glad I did! I&#x27;ve suffered from acne and the hideous scars and dark spots that it left me with. Oh the feeling of not wanting to be seen without makeup on. But after the first day yet alone the first week of using this product I&#x27;m simply amazed! My face evened out and I no longer have dark spots! My scars are fading away like crazy and I have a few zits here and there but so worth it! I&#x27;ve never seen this great of results with ANYTHING I&#x27;ve ever used. I will definitely be making my next purchase as soon as I run out! Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Works well on African American skin!</li>
    <li> Reduces brown spots!!!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I AM A 58YR OLD WOMEN OF COLOR.  THIS PRODUCT DID ABSOUTLEY NOTHING FOR ME.  I WANTED IT MAINLY FOR THE DARK SPOTS. NO CHANGE IN SPOTS OR WRINKLES.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a new product for me, I purchased it based on the positive comments. I will most definitely share mine once there is something to share.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I must admit I have a huge serum obsession! I am seriously addicted to Vitamin C serums &amp; the Wonderpiel Vitamin C serum was just added to my list of favorites. I just love how refreshed my skin feels after each use. Plus I tend to drench myself, from head to toe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary Wonderpiel Vitamin C Serum in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;XOXO&lt;br /&gt;Chelsie Fletcher&lt;br /&gt;Product Review Blogger</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference on my skin so far. My skin was not so bad to start with, I&#x27;m mostly looking for to get help with the sun spots.</li>
    <li> Another Vitamin C but this one is for dark spots-- I am not a doctor or a dermatologist but if you have dark spots on your face I think you need to see a doc not just put a serum on it and ignore the issue. Please go check out your skin for skin cancer it is very important. I have known four people in my life have skin cancer and one of those four lost their lives due to skin cancer. So please keep an eye on your moles, skin and anything abnormal on your skin should be checked out by a doc with some letters after their names.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when it comes to just a Vitamin C serums this one is great. I just hate seeing that statement &amp;#34;dark spot corrector&amp;#34; maybe I am thinking of these words differently. But this serum is a nice thick serum that goes on without any stickiness and residue. I like how my face feels after I put it on and I look at pictures in my June/July files for my blog and I am honestly say that the serums are making a difference. I know this facial expression is sad (actually I am in pain in the pic) but this pic is completely untouched.  I am #hippiehappy even if the picture seems otherwise-- that is due to a pinched nerve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free for my unbiased honest  #hippiehappy or #nothippiehappy opinion.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I had brown spots that appeared on my hands, they looked like freckles! A nurse told me it was probably sun spots. I&#x27;ve been applying this serum on the back on my hands for 3 weeks now, followed by sunscreen and the spots are almost gone! It&#x27;s simply amazing. It is pricey but so worth it. Now my hands are almost back to normal 😊. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> I been using it for a few months now and I definitely notice a diffence in my face. However, a about two weeks ago I accidentally got some in my eye and got a terrible eye infection. I had to pay my doctor a visit and get medication.</li>
    <li> I have spent so much money on skincare products and most did nothing spectacular to make my skin feel or appear any younger. Until I found this serum on Internet. It was a promotion on their website and I got it with a huge discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin seems more healthy and toned, and the small lines around eyes and mouth are beginning to disappear after a few days of using it twice a day. I honestly recommend it to all women who wants to feel younger skin on their face again!</li>
    <li> This product works amazing at getting out dark spots. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles so I couldn&#x27;t see if it worked for that but I put it on at night and I noticed that my skin was firmer. Overall, for your skin care needs I would recommend this product and I also suffer from dry skin and this product did not dry out my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week, but my skin feels sooo smooth. May be my imagination, but I think I am seeing the red lines and age spots fading. It&#x27;s a small bottle, but it takes such a small amount, it should last for a long time.</li>
    <li> Ok. been using this for 2 weeks and have noticed my dark spots are not so present.  Will review later if they continue to fad towards the end of my first bottle.</li>
    <li> Maybe it works for others , but not for me.  Too expensive to try again on a &amp;#34;just in case it works&amp;#34; basis.</li>
    <li> I usually prefer to use the most popular products to attain the most flawless results. I was using some other serum for many months. It was good, but I wanted something different; something that could also give my face a younger look. I bought it few weeks ago to test it out from amazon and started using from the day i received it. It wasn&#x27;t my first experience on amazon, but this serum totally changed my skin. I was really impressed and thought about buying some more bottles in the future. The first thing that I noticed was that my skin didn&#x27;t feel dry anymore. I loved the soft touch of my face which the Vitamin C extracts gave me. The fine lines and dark spots started to reduce.</li>
    <li> So far have not seen any difference in dark spots but my skin seems somewhat brighter. Will give it more time. The picture shows dark spots gone after one application but that was not so for me.</li>
    <li> Amazing is all I can say about this serum!</li>
    <li> No breakouts and really seems to be helping even skin tone after just a little over a week!</li>
    <li> In my opinion, a serum is the most important part of any skincare regime. Most good serums contain vitamin C, and with good reason. C is a tried and true skin rejuvenator. This product, used regularly, can help with the exfoliation process, leaving you with baby-soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;Cleanse your face and throat, and blot your face gently. If you have any stinging, wait a moment, and then apply the serum.&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution, when using any product with hyaluronic acid, you must use a sunscreen. Since most day creams have sun protection of 15% or above, using your favorite day cream after the serum is fine.&lt;br /&gt;This is not a quick fix, it can take a few weeks to notice big changes, but after about 10 days I noticed my skin looked more refreshed with a more even tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample size to test, and after using it I can recommend this product.</li>
    <li> WARNING. FAKE REVIEWS&lt;br /&gt;Do they think we&#x27;re that stupid? Click on the names of the 5 star reviewers and look at their other reviews. They are all the same...reviews for iPhone battery, slimming tea, children&#x27;s books about horses. Chances are that the few 1 star reviews are the only ones that are genuine. I&#x27;m losing faith in Amazon because of all the phony, paid reviews everywhere.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week.  My skin soaks it up but no oily residue!  I can apply makeup within 4 min, which I really like!  I am already noticing softer skin with a more even tone. I am quite sure I have an awesome product.  The seller is so sweet and helpful for questions I had about my order and went above and beyond my expectation!!  I am totally satisfied with this product</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money. I have used daily for a month, no change at all.</li>
    <li> This product was really good , made my face really smooth. My dark sport started going away but accidentally spilled a whole chunck of it. Am ordering some more soon.</li>
    <li> I put off writing a review for almost a month because I really wanted a chance to try this product out. I am in my 60&#x27;s and have probably tried just about every product I could to take care of my skin. I also have sensitive skin, easily developing reactions to many products. This is a wonderful product. Oh, I still have wrinkles, and given the fact I am very facially expressive I probably always will. But my skin is smoother and more radiant. What wrinkles I do have are much less noticeable. I strongly suggest being diligent about sun screen. I live in an area with sunny weather most of the year, and well into the 100&#x27;s for at least 4 months. Nothing will correct excessive sun damage in this environment, but I will say that Wonderpiel has already lessened much of the uneven tone that so much sun caused, even with SPF 55 and up.</li>
    <li> I used the serum as suggested.  Cut down on the coffee,increased my daily consumption of water, used the recommended  sunscreen,applied the serum at night and in the morning four five weeks and have not seen any difference in the tone,texture of the skin on my face or in the reduction of discolored portions of my facial skin.</li>
    <li> I was hoping that it would help with the dark spots on my face but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t. It did clear my face up</li>
    <li> This product did work in the beginning.  I am revising my review.  I have since purchased a second bottle (in December 2014) and noticed that the formula ingredients are not the same. In fact, this new bottle looks and feels like cloudy water.  I compared the list of ingredients on the first bottle to the one I currently have. Not pleased with this finding at all and will be returning this latest purchase.</li>
    <li> I see it working as a regular serum. Does it provide the miraculous results it claims to? Not in my book! It&#x27;s relatively affordable but I had to W A I T for this product _ well over 2 weeks! I am not pleased about that. I also don&#x27;t like that there are very few ways to communicate with the company that makes it.</li>
    <li> I had been using this serum for over 2 months (I bought 2 bottles as the reviews were very good), but no changes at all that I can see on my skin. The dark spots, the superficial wrinkles are the same. I had high expectations, I guess, but it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I &#x27;ve tried several serums and this one is the best!</li>
    <li> I have not noticed a difference at all with my dark spots. Nor with firmer skin. Would not probably order again. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am blown away by the way my skin looks and feels after only 2 days of using this product. My dark spots are already lighter, and fine lines are less noticable...in 2 days thats amazing. And my skin feels so soft, its unbelievable. I can&#x27;t wait to see what using it for a few weeks will do. Thank you for this great product.</li>
    <li> I really like this and will purchase again. Even my husband noticed a difference!</li>
    <li> This product stimulated sloughing off of old dead skin.  My friend noticed saying, &amp;#34;You have a &#x27;peaches and cream&#x27; look&amp;#34;.  Enough said.</li>
    <li> Is three weeks that I been used, I don&#x27;t see any changes.</li>
    <li> I like this product so far. I just started a week ago. Thanks so much for sending the tips on an everyday basis on how to use WONDERPIEL skin care. That shows me you care about your product and that show me you care about me. Thanks Jill</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have time to write reviews often but making time for this serum....it does all it claims and more.  Best ever.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works. I&#x27;m going to order more.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product daily for the last month and did not notice any improvement in my skin (such as lightening of sun spots and wrinkle reduction). Since this serum is quite expensive  I will most likely order something comparable next time and will not be ordering this product again. I do notice a little bit of orange tinge to my skin color after applying this. Which may be due to the color of the serum.</li>
    <li> Love it my skin looks so much brighter and smoother!</li>
    <li> Spots are still there!</li>
    <li> At first I was a little leery of this serum because it was so thin and watery.  But I tried it and am very happy with the results.  When I ran out, I tried to use up my old serum before replacing with more Wonderpiel.  Brown spots reappeared.  Got more Wonderpiel, tossed the old serum and am happy again!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product; it truly does as promised!  Recently someone told me that I look really good and that I&#x27;m even looking younger!!!  :-)  Can&#x27;t beat that!  Thanks for the product; by the way the price is very reasonable too!</li>
    <li> It works.give it a try.i got a good glow</li>
    <li> I have been looking forward to trying a hyaluronic serum and have set my expectations high.  Luckily enough, I was given a chance to try Wonderpiel for free.  I have been disappointed by claims from other manufacturers that theirs is the best anti-wrinkle serum that reduces fine lines, blah-blah-blah…they were not.  This, WONDERPIEL LUXURY EVEN GLOW SERUM, shows A LOT OF PROMISE.  I have been using it for a few days now (less than a week) and I have honestly noticed my skin smoothening and my skin tone has begun to even.  The age spots have lightened and I can only hope that with longer and continued use, it will all even out giving a lovely, youthful glow.  I love the subtle hint of citrus and its non-greasy formula.  It takes a while to be thoroughly absorbed so allow ample time for it to dry before applying moisturizer or make up.  Wonderpiel serum is a very promising new product in the skin care market and I look forward to writing an update on how it is keeping its promise to me!</li>
    <li> I waited until the one bottle was used up to judge fairly. I didn&#x27;t see much difference sadly but also there was no new damage.</li>
    <li> I bought this to remove the dark spots on my face. I used the whole bottle before I decided to write a review. This product did nothing for me. I used twice a day for over a month and nothing. In fact I wear sunscreen on my face every day and even noticed a few more spots showing up on my face. I saw no difference in my complexion, fine lines, etc. like this product claims to help. I would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> With aging we must take steps to revive the skin and looking a great as we can afford the Dark Sport Corrector is great and can bring the look that you wish with regular use for that result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For several weeks I have been using the Dark Spot Corrector/Remover to see that change within the skin since using I have notice that my face right below my eyes which is the cheeks is looking less bloated and my freckles are noticeable as wee. This product has hyaluronic acid and does help with the process for a glowing look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Package well and to me presentation is key it let’s me know that the company has spent time to give you a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gave me this product for free for an honest #review of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WONDERPIEL Skin Care gave me this product for free for an honest #review of the product.</li>
    <li> The dark spots were on my face they seem lighter since use.</li>
    <li> After about 10 days of faithful use, I did notice about a 50%  lightening of the worst  freckles or age spots--whatever you would call them.  [They look like freckles but were in  a dark line going across the side  of my face, looking like a freckle tattoo.]  If it were cheaper, I would probably give it more stars, since they are not gone, but lighter.</li>
