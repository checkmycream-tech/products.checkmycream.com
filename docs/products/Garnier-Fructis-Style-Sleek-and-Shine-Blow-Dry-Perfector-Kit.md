      <li>I did write to Garnier who responded and requested I contact customer service to \\&quot;determine how best to assist me\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Best of luck!!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>This is negligent at best because it is a chemical that is not regulated...relaxers.  </li>
      <li>Then i waited the 20 minutes and put in the heat activated perfect</li>
      <li>Made my unmanagable hair great!</li>
      <li>Nothing to do w the packaging or time of arrival,  which btw was great!</li>
      <li>My hair WAS in perfect condition.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s probably best to skip it.  </li>
      <li>admit, I shampooed and conditioned before using step 1, and I think this contributed to my wonderful results.</li>
      <li>This product worked great on my hair!</li>
      <li>The best way to describe the smell is rotten, fermented eggs with a hint of paint thinner.</li>
      <li>No matter how damp from rain or humidity, my hair retained its perfect, blow-dried look.  </li>
      <li>Also you must follow the instructions perfectly for application, timing, rinsing.</li>

      <li>I NOW know that this product isn&#x27;t to be used on highlighted hair, even if it&#x27;s in EXCELLENT condition.</li>
      <li>Then I ran my straightener through and sprayed my hairbrush with my anti-humidity spray (Garnier&#x27;s is the best) and ran that through.</li>
      <li>My best friend just revealed to me that she&#x27;s gotten needles of Botox in her crows feet at 31.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ladies no one should use this especially on treated hair.  Colored, permed etc. and leaving anything in that smells and you have to wear gloves is a huge red flag and 20 minutes.  Try Carols Daughter products - Minoi  or Wen o get your hair back.</li>
    <li> This stuff works, but smells SO BAD.  made me want to throw up.. smels sooo bad, be prepared</li>
    <li> I wish I read reviews b/f I used this product.... It is completely awful and damaged my hair beyond repair.  It is so damaged and fried that it won&#x27;t even dry.  I am left with an entire head of clumps of hair that look like fried wet cotton balls.  I have cut as much as I can off it however, it is damaged less from a 1/4 inch from the roots and downward.  If that wasn&#x27;t bad enough, it stripped my blonde hair and I have streaks of copper and orange from a color change.  I bet pure BLEACH and Gasoline would have done less damage than this did to my hair.    AWFUL!</li>
    <li> I like the results that I got from this product for the most part but wow does it ever smell terrible. I got a hint of a hair remover scent when I opened it &amp; was hesitant. I am a BzzAgent &amp; was provided the product or else I might have just returned it from that alone. The smoothing results were quite good. It is a little bitr damaging &amp; drying though. I guess its a trade off.</li>
    <li> A few things about this terrible product.    1. It seriously damages your hair. It even smells like the horrendous perm my mom used to get in the early 80s that permanently damaged her hair. Fortunately, I tried the product only on a small part of my hair and realized the damage it would do to the rest of my mane early on.    2. It doesn&#x27;t work. While it does \\&quot;relax\\&quot; hair a little bit and makes it a tad straighter, it doesn&#x27;t do what it promised to do, mainly reduce frizz.     It is such a waste of money and will destroy your hair. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> im acctually sitting at the computer with the 20 minute solution in my hair, let me tell you, it smells SO BAD. when i was applying it, i would put the serum in my hair, then run and stick my head outside of my window so i could breathe, because it smelled up my whole bathroom! i would have to get some pretty amazing results to make me like this product after the horrible experience with the smell, i really almost threw up.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible and the only reason it even has 1 star is so that I could write the review to warn others. First of all, the Step 1 solution stinks and even now, three shampoos after completion, I still smell the rotten egg smell. Now on to the results... my hair... oh, my once-gorgeous hair... FRIED, DRIED, FRIZZY. All the ailments that were supposed to be CURED by the god-awful product were only made worse.  In hindsight, I suppose I&#x27;m the true idiot because did I really think, after years of perfecting blow-drying my curly hair, that a $10 product would be the cure-all?    Garnier, you should be ashamed of yourselves.</li>
    <li> This product is a waste of money.  Not only did it not \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; my blow dry, but it dried out my hair so severely that I&#x27;ve had to use deep conditioners for a week after to get it back to semi-normal. I don&#x27;t know if this product works on thin, straight hair, but it is NOT meant for thick and wavy/curly hair.  I am completely dissatisfied with this.</li>
    <li> Frankly I can&#x27;t believe all of the bad reviews. One thing I noticed, most of the people trying out this product are not used to using a relaxer.  As far as relaxers go ...this is a good one at a low cost!  It is even on par with some of the most expensive so-called Japanese relaxers which I have received at exclusive salons.    Things you must know when using relaxers:   * Have really frizzy hair to begin with  * Do not brush your hair until you have used the follow-up Smoother  * After blow dry you must flat iron your hair    The results are very adequate and worth the bit of damage if you truly have frizzy hair (especially genetically frizzy hair like mine)</li>
    <li> Really a zero star product.  Product packaging stated it was safe for color treated hair.  As I rinsed the first step out of my hair,  I watched my color run down the drain.   This product stripped my color and fried my hair.  I have had 2 cuts since I used this,  and think I still need one more before all the damage is gone.   Teriible terrible product.</li>
    <li> I love garnier products but this is a mess. I now have dry frizz and broken \\&quot;baby hairs\\&quot;. Dull, lifeless and fried. My hair has not been chemically treated in 10 years and I turned it into cotton candy in 10 minutes. I  hoped that this product would give me a salon blowout effect...do NOT do it.  Consider this a public service announcement!</li>
    <li> Wow, I wish I had read the reviews before buying this.  It smells horrible, not conditioning, damaging, etc.  Although my hair does not seem to be too much worse than it was originally I would not use this again.  I was hoping this would be like a conditioning treatment I had gotten at the salon.  Not so.</li>
    <li> Yea it smells bad, but it&#x27;s totally worth it. My hair feels so much better, definitely not ruined as everyone else&#x27;s reviews state. My hair is not curly, but normally dries with weird waves and I always end up putting it in a ponytail. Also usually when I dry it, it looks good for about 15 minutes and then falls flat and no longer straight. This product prevented that from happening. Will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and it ruined my hair.  I called the company and they sent me back a refund check.  Not nearly enough to go to professional salon, $115.00 later, and get my hair back to normal.</li>
    <li> this product ruined my hair. the box is very missleading, it says it only lasts 7 washes and is NOT a perm or relaxor. yet it smells exactly like perm and is VERY strong. you would never know from what the box says! it claims to make your hair shiny and silky but it does the opposite! DO NOT USE THIS! it literly fryed my hair off! my hair is currently in terrible condition after using this, id compair it too the texture of an afro ( i am white by the way)! it is dry, frizzy and falls out in clumps when i pull the ends, i cant even brush it anymore! this ruined my hair! i cannot belive this product is allowed on shelves! my hair is currently frizzy-ier and dryer then its ever been in my life! i need to keep it in a ponytail or else it looks werid! ive been crying for a whole day after using this! this is by far the worst product ive ever tryed and i highly recomnd to NOT use it. I WOULD COMPARE THIS TO PUTTING A JAR OF &#x27;VEET&#x27; OR &#x27;NAIR&#x27; ON YOUR HEAD!  UPDATE!: its been serveral months sense ive used this and i cut all of that damaged hair from this product off slowly so i wouldnt be bald sense i had short hair to begin with. i just cut off inch by inch as my hair grew. my hair is now back to its normal texture and just a &#x27;bob&#x27; thats above my sholders. i still have breakage at the ends i think it might be still the hair that was damaged by this. i might still have to cut off a few inches after my hair grows some. i now take better care of my hair. i dont use random products like this, i condition about 5 times a week, i dont dye my hair as much.  ive descovered some good proucts over this journey. i really like john frieda full repair shampoo and conditionar. i also like the full repair serum. the aussie 3 minute miracle, and the aussie hair insurance leave in conditionar.  nexxus is also pretty good. i defently learned my lesson to not use harsh at home products like this! i only shampoo and condition now! and i only dye my roots insteed of my intire head.  BOTTOM LINE DONT USE THIS! NOT WORTH THE RISK! HARSH CHEMICAL! TAKE THE REVIEWS SERIOUSLY!</li>
    <li> Please, please, PLEASE do not buy this product. I followed the directions to a T. It did NOT make my mildly wavy hair less frizzy, even after flat ironing, but did leave it with an unpleasant odor and a waxy feeling that has persisted. The smell was bad enough to literally trigger my gag reflex. It was horrendous and I could only describe it as akin to rotting garbage.     Do not waste your money or your time.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few weeks and now I just wish I never bought it. This product did nothing to my hair even though I used it exactly as instructed. My hair still look curly and even more frizzy. It seems like my hair are standing on my head and flying around like crazy. I don&#x27;t like this product. It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible!!! It has been two months and my hair has not gone back to normal. It feels dry like straw and is falling out big time. Not to mention I have broken hair everywhere! When I wet my hair I used to have pretty curls now I just have the top half of my hair straight and the bottom tips curly..not a pretty sight. I am so upset about this product and what it did to my hair. The chemicals are way to strong and was more a relaxer than a frizz reducer. And the worst part is that I have washed my hair so many times afterwards trying to get it out and its still not gone! 7 shampoos my a$$!</li>
    <li> I did not see on the box that they don&#x27;t recommend for use on high&#x3D;lighted hair....I no longer have the box to check what it says or doesn&#x27;t say. It does say it on their web-site.  I used it and my hair was pretty nice after.  3 days later when I washed it for the 1st time, my hair where there are highlights is like dry straw.  Terrible!  I just got a hair cut, so I really can&#x27;t get it trim....and it&#x27;s not just the ends anyway.  Just loaded it up with a flat iron conditioning oil &amp; used a large curling iron on low to set the oil in.  Looks nice after spending an hour on it, but lord knows what I am going to have when I wash it again.  My fault for not fully checking out this product before using.  I may need to go to my hairdresser for salon deep conditioning treatment.  Hope it doesn&#x27;t starting falling out like other people have said.  If I had read the reviews, I would have never used it!  I would not recommend this product to anyone, even if you don&#x27;t have high-lighted hair, the chemicals are strong &amp; can&#x27;t be good for any hair!  Hope my comments save someone from the mistake I made.  :-)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I fell for that! That thing fried my hair!!! When I applied the first stinky product on my hair I saw it was doing something wrong! My hair was melting! Literally melting! so I immediately rinsed it off but it was too late! my hair was falling while I was rinsing it! i shampooed to get that thing off and deep conditioned, used tons of oils like argan oil and avocado oil. So when I was first blow drying it after the horrible episode, I could even comb it, my hair was totally destroyed, my hair is shoulder length and it was ruined from root to tip!!! So what could I do? Just trim it wouldn&#x27;t work, i would have to shave it!!!! And that idea was just too awful! So i cried, yelled and was soaking my hair with argan oil, to the point it was really greasy and my hair after 10 minutes had just absorbed it completely! So i flat ironed it! It made it straight, but my hair was just falling out as i was doing it, Thank God I have a lot of hair!!! My ends are breaking off like crazy. if i pull my ends a little bit it breaks on my hand! So now i found out the Fekkai Line. And I just ordered it! I&#x27;m using argan oil on my hair 3 times a day, and i&#x27;m washing it less bc my hairstylist said the natural oils would restore the nutrients the stupid product removed! So the first week I went 1 week without washing it! Keeping my hair on a ponytail, doing everything everyone was saying it was good so I wouldn&#x27;t have to shave my head!!! So now, my hair is a little bit better. still breaking off, I&#x27;m afraid i&#x27;m gonna have to cut i shorter bc it&#x27;s uneven now from all the breaking and falling! I wanna sue that stupid garnier for having a product like that! I could have gone bald!! It&#x27;s so sad to say but i&#x27;m thankful my hair was only breaking off and fried, destroyed but i still have it on me! I spent sooo much money trying to repair this mistake! That i could have done a really expensive treatment at first, to straighten my hair and avoid going through this nightmare!  Please ladies a few more minutes getting your hair done won&#x27;t kill, but this product might!!!</li>
    <li> The first time you use this product it leaves your hair feeling greasy. I didn&#x27;t notice that straightening my hair was any easier even after only one wash.</li>
    <li> I bought this product like six months ago and once I read the directions I was scared to try it by myself.  My best friend is a hair stylist and asked her what she thought about me using this product.  I told her it has gloves and crazy instructions and I didn&#x27;t want to attempt it myself.  My hair is pretty straight already but I have some annoying wave in the back of it.  I took this in to the salon and we did exactly what the instructions stated.  The first step smelled horrible.  My friend said she doesn&#x27;t know how this is a \\&quot;non\\&quot; permenent serum when it smelled just like it stated it wasn&#x27;t, a perm.  She did her professional clipping and combing.  Also I did notice she didn&#x27;t use even close to the whole bottle. And she didn&#x27;t touch my scalp with it.  After both steps were completed she trimmed my hair and blew it out.  So far so good.  I will NOT use it again just in case it does what everyone else is stating.  My hair is pin straight and that little wave in the back is gone.  But I would definitly be careful using this product.  Anything with gloves and a huge list of instructions should be a red flag.  For everyone else that has horribly damaged hair I would suggest getting a professional brand shampoo &amp; conditioner system.  Also try BIOSILK oil.  It works wonders.</li>
    <li> Bought this at the pharmacy looking for a good serum to smooth out frizzes after I blow out my hair. Oh no, I should have read the instructions before I purchased. I thought this was a conditioner &amp; serum duo. What it smells like is a relaxer, and much like a relaxer, you leave it in for 20 minutes while the smell permeates your whole house. What it smells like after you wash it is still a relaxer (chemically enhanced rotten eggs) but what it does to you hair is worse.  This product will shorten the time it takes to blow out your hair in about half. Bonus. The non-bonus? Is that your hair will LOOK dry. And stiff. And, yes, frizzy.  Must have been irony day at the plant when they made and labeled this stuff.  I bet this was originally made to clean leather shoes or something but they decided to sell it as a hair product to see how sales would do.  At 200+ reviews, most of which are shite, the executives at Garnier are high-fiving their marketers for another ingenious and dubious marketing campaign.  Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> I,like another reader, just saw this one day at Target and tried it (w/o ever having read a single review).  It worked very, very well and didn&#x27;t dry my hair out.  Yes, after you do the first rinse (where you can&#x27;t add conditioner) it appears dry but I think that&#x27;s just the chemical sitting on top of the hair shaft not yet infused by the heat/flat iron (just a guess). Next you blow dry then flat iron.  When I flat ironed, my ends seemed a little dry so I just did a quick trim with each section I went along with the flat iron(but I do that anyways every few weeks when I&#x27;m not even using the product). Once I finished flat ironing...my hair was beautiful and silky, unlike what I&#x27;ve been able to get with any other hair product.  When I came back to order more through Amazon I was completely shocked at the reviews and baffled...and scared to order again.  But I did, and the second time I got the same results.  As time goes on I can tell when I need to do it again...like now...my hair takes longer to blow dry, longer to flat iron, and doesn&#x27;t get as sleek and straight as when I have the product in my hair shaft.  I feel bad others have had such a bad experience and also feel bad the product...which has been heaven sent for me (at such a great price)...is getting such a bad rap. I&#x27;m not paid to write reviews...just a mom of 3 kids with curly, kinky, mixed hair that was looking for an easier way to keep my hair straight more easily without black hair straightners I&#x27;ve used in the past.  Those caused true damage.  This did nothing for me but improve my hair issues...glad to have it. Maybe try a strand test....it is really worth the try...so cheap.  Just a note...I have no hair color, highlights, or chemicals in my hair and blow dry and flat iron regularly.  So maybe that makes the difference...if your hair is previously treated with chemicals it could dry it, mine isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I have the kind of hair that is in between...not straight, not curly, a mass of waves!! I usually either blow dry and use a straightener; or leave wet and get a mass of waves that tend to frizz!&lt;br /&gt;My local salon was advertising a Brazilian blow dry for super straight hair but the $350 price tag and the fact that my almost daily swims would lessen the longevity of the effects, put me off. So when I saw this, boy, was I excited!&lt;br /&gt;Lets begin with the smell, its far worse than hair dye - my kids ran away holding their noses (and no this was real not their usual drama - it stinks)  and it reminded me of the harsh perm type smell of hair salons in the late 80s, early 90s - and folks, this smell lasts a day or so - not as harsh as during the application, but it it still there a day or so later!&lt;br /&gt;After using, blow drying and straightening...yes...my hair was poker straight and shiny. Even better, I woke the next morning and did not have to run the straighteners through - still straight and no frizz - I thought I was hooked! And for a fraction of the cost of the salon treatment&lt;br /&gt;A week later - less so! My hair feels odd. Not sure how best to describe it, but I guess the best description is as though I have taken gallons of some kind of styling aid and left it on my hair. It feels thick and coated, I have to wear it straight as anything else looks limp and odd! My hair does not have much frizz which is amazing, as its 103 outside as I write, and in this weather my hair tends to be a fuzzy mess - but on the other hand it just hangs there as this straight, limp mess! It does kink and does need additional straightening which rally defeats the object - I can achieve the same results without this product and get a lot more shine! I cannot wait for this stuff to be out of my hair!&lt;br /&gt;If this was a one application thing - great, it does what is intends to do - but after a wash or so, your hair is in limbo - limp not shiny, and heavily coated!&lt;br /&gt;Bases on my use, I will neither use this again nor try the salon treatment which sounds as though it works in much the same wayagain nor try the salon treatment which sounds as though it works in much the same way</li>
    <li> I am a BzzAgent and received this product to try. The smell is gross like perm solution. I still have to blow dry and iron my hair as usual and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s much faster. The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that the crease I get after wearing a pony tail is not as severe. After reading the ingredients, there is some pretty harsh stuff in this solution that will burn your hair if it stays on too long, hence the numerous warnings on the box. There are not benefits to this product that justify applying chemicals to your hair.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product after I saw a commercial for it! I have mostly straight hair with some terribly placed waves and fly-aways, so I was hopeful about what this stuff would do for me.     I looked everywhere and finally found it at a CVS and bought it immediately. The process of using the product was easy and although the first solution smelled a little yucky, the reviews from people saying they almost threw up seem quite exaggerated.     However, in the end the whole thing was pointless because it only made my hair worse! I was horrifed to find all my little fly-aways had turned into tight, cork-screw curls, which I promptly ripped out because I didn&#x27;t know what else to do! Even after blow drying/ flat ironing it straight, as they direct you to do, my annoying waves remained the same.     When I asked my bf if he noticed a difference, he said yes: that my hair was super dried out.     DON&#x27;T BOTHER!</li>
    <li> with normal shampooing and washing my hair is wavy and a bit frizzy but nothing a little texturizing creme can&#x27;t handle. introduce the garnier blow dry perfector and my hair turned into an unmanagable frizz ball. after the 20 minute 1st step i could not get my fingers through my hair, much less a comb. i added the heat activated 2nd step and blew dry and wound up looking like i stuck my finger in a socket. even when i DON&#x27;T blow dry my hair it never looked this bad.  it feels disgusting and was a total waste of $12 and an hour of my life.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give NEGATIVE ratings on this.    I have had alot of clients asking about this product.  Since I am not one to bash or recommend products I set out to try it on my own hair...  I have medium thickness, brown, wavy and very healthy hair and ALWAYS use professional products to keep it strong.     I found NO difference in the straighting aspect of this product than when I use a round brush without it!  Most people cannot use a round brush properly OR have the time for it...I was quite surprised to see it was one of the steps to getting it \\&quot;straight\\&quot; in the end.  My hair IS dry from the product and I already have put on some protein and moisture  packs on my hair to repair any damage, hopefully that will help.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t see why this product is even marketed!  Everything could have been done with just some styling aids and the right blowdry.  If you can&#x27;t do either....don&#x27;t bother with THIS product either.    What a joke.</li>
    <li> i feel that this product was great for me, i first saw the commercial a few weeks back and i thought to myself...there is a way to get frizz free relaxed looking hair for cheap... Now i read the reviews on various sites and a lot of them were mixed. I am a biracial teenager mixed with African American and Caucasian. I think this product has a lot to do with hair texture. Those whos hair is not course and not thick the product seemed to mess their hair up. Most of the Ethnic women who have interviewed this product have had success with it... This product also seems to work if ur hair is curly and it is heavy. if u have tight curls but there is a thickness to it this product will work for you. about the smell....get over it... anyone who uses nair will understand that nair smells a gabigillion times worse. hair dye smells worse. this is a pretty good product...a little too costly because i find out the serum is only a one time usage thing. i also was very happy because it left my hair easy to do, shiny smooth and smelling good. very very very pleased!</li>
    <li> I moved to humid Florida 6 months ago and can&#x27;t afford a Brazilian blowout so I decided to try this product. The smell is absolutely awful. I had to rinse it out for about 10 minutes before my hair felt half way normal and it did not clump together. I was happy with it after the first blow out. It was not frizzy straight and it did stay longer, but it seemed to wear off after only a few washes and in the end my hair was extremely dry and brittle. I ended up having to go to my hairdresser and get a deep conditioning treatment and a trim because my ends were breaking off. I DO NOT recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this before I read the reviews on here and was really leery about trying it.  I decided to test in on a patch of hidden hair in case it came out badly.  My test patch went beautifully and I then did my entire head.  I am very happy with the results.  I will say that the smell is really awful during the process, but the smell rinsed out with the perfecting cream rinse. I can&#x27;t help but think that there are some user errors in all of the bad reviews.  This product does recommended certain hair types and maybe people are using it on hair that it&#x27;s not intended for?  I plan to update my review after the 7th shampoo.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I am reserving that judgement to see how well it lasts.    If you  have coarse, thick, curly hair as pictured on the package, I recommend doing a test first.  It certainly adds to an already time-consuming process, but well worth the effort, I think.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d seen this in the store and for once I didn&#x27;t do any research on a product before buying as my girls and I like the Fructis products. My teenage daughter was having picture day at school and wanted her naturally wavy and unruly hair straight. We followed the directions to the letter.   I will agree, it does smell like rotten eggs. However, when it came time to blow dry her hair, we could not believe the difference.   Her normally tangle wavy mess was almost pin straight without me having to do a thing. She still had her little bump where her ponytail usually is. I also flat ironed as suggested. She went to school and people commented and were touching her hair all day. Even her dad came home from work and started playing with her hair! Day two, I did a quick flat iron touch up. Day three, nothing! Her hair is still straight and looking amazing.   Now, it is not as shiny as the box shows or claims it will be, but she does not care. Her hair is not too fluffy or getting tangled every two minutes AND it is staying straight even after dance and gym! VERY, very happy.</li>
    <li> OK...  So my issue is with the advertising of this product, if it is a relaxer for curly hair call IT THAT!!!  I was going to get a protein treatment like VO5 and saw this, I read the box and looked at the pictures and though ya, that is what I want.  My hair is healthy, I haven&#x27;t dyed it in the last three months, but three months ago I had put in lighter ends (so mild bleaching).  My ends were OK, not split, not too damaged, definately not as damaged as the hair samples shown on the the box.  I use a good shampoo and conditioner and treat my hair well.    I got home and opened the box, I saw the gloves and was leery, why would I need gloves?  I re-read the instructions and again read safe for colour treated hair.  I opened the 1st tube, this is what I really regret, I smelt it and it smelled like perm, I should have junked it.... :(  I read again the instructions and thought it will be OK...  I applied it and after about 8 minutes I kind of freaked out and decided to rinse it out early.  Right away I could tell my hair was wrecked.  Chuncks of my lighter ends came out while I was rinsing.  Then when I applied product No 2, I couldn&#x27;t get my fingers through my hair.  The ends that were lightened, split and cracked, chunks of hair came out and all of the remaining ends scrunched up and looked awful.  My hair was completely wrecked.  I had to cut off over 2 inches of hair.  I am pretty bitter.    This product is not a smoother, it is a chemical relaxer and if it had been advertised as such I would have stuck with my VO5 treatment...  Very very angry...</li>
    <li> I just had the bulk of my hair chopped off today thanks to using this product two weeks ago. For starters, the first product in the kit smells horrible. The best way to describe the smell is rotten, fermented eggs with a hint of paint thinner. I couldn&#x27;t keep the product in for more than 15 minutes (the directions are to leave it in for 20) because of the smell and it started to burn a little. The second item is just a leave in conditioner, nothing special. In the end, my hair was severely damaged, brittle, dry and falling out in chunks. My advice is, if you have curly hair, suck it up and deal with the frizz......do not use this product!!!!!!! Otherwise, you&#x27;ll be spending the next couple of months repairing the damage this product will cause......like me.</li>
    <li> This product ruined my hair, which I tried to cut off to fix but the damage is so far down.  On one part on the very top of my head all that is left is only a few short, wiry, 1/2 centimeter long hairs.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t done this just looking at the ad!  Take these reviews seriously, unless you want to look like you have a Kate Goslin Hairdo for the next few months.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product - had a very similar experience to \\&quot;Patent Mom\\&quot; - read her review to understand what to expect.  I wanted to help clarify some things about the product that could help you decide if this product is right for you.      No, I don&#x27;t work for the company.  I really liked this product, but the chemical smells made me nervous, so I asked my stylist about it.  She had some interesting info - I thought it might be helpful to others, as well.    This product is similar to home perms from the 80s.  The thiol breaks the protein bonds in your hair, and then you use heat to essentially \\&quot;re-set\\&quot; them into the style you want.  So, YES - it is a chemical, it does smell, and you need to be careful if you do other things to your hair on a regular basis - it could cause damage.  You are essentially \\&quot;perming\\&quot; your hair to be straight.      Some suggested things to consider before you buy:  1) How often you do other chemical processes to your hair, and how extreme they are.  If you regularly bleach your hair (i.e. you maintain blonde but are naturally a brunette) it&#x27;s probably best to skip it.  If you regularly highlight your hair, you probably want to wait a few weeks before you use this... and then wait a few more weeks before you highlight again.  2) Given that it&#x27;s a chemical process, consider it a \\&quot;once every 6 months\\&quot; kind of thing, not a \\&quot;once every 6 weeks\\&quot; kind of thing.    3) How prone your hair is to damage, anyway.  If you would never chemically straighten your hair, this isn&#x27;t for you.      For best results... PLAN to spend a lot of time on the final step - blowdry and straightening.  This is the part where you are telling your hair how you want it to \\&quot;re-set\\&quot; (heat activates the thiol).  The more thorough you are in getting your hair perfectly smooth, the better results you will have.      I hope that helps!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use this product! First of all, it didn&#x27;t really doing anything to straighten my hair-I still had to go through my regular time consuming routine of blowdrying and iron, but the worst part was that about 2 weeks after using (according to instructions) my hair started to break and fall out in huge clumps, I felt like a chemo patient. If I hadn&#x27;t read the reviews warning of this I would have completely freaked out. This stuff should be taken off the market!</li>
    <li> My hair is long and wavy, sometimes I flat iron it to make it sleek and I thought this would be a great solution for frizzies. After using this product, my hair felt like I had soaked it in glue for 20 minutes. I could not comb through it, and when I finally managed to get it dry it looked frazzled like a troll doll. It has been 3 washes and the ends look ravaged, my hair is stiff and feels like straw. It is not smooth at all and was actually 10 times more difficult to style. I will NEVER use this product again and would not recommend it at all. Please do not try this at home, save yourself the grief. I want my hair back!</li>
    <li> I used this horrible, awful product and I should have known better when i opened it and smelled perm solution. However, Garnier is such a big name I didn&#x27;t think they&#x27;d put out such a terrible, misleading product. Anyway, I used the product and washed my hair, and could immediately tell that something was wrong. Clumps of my hair were falling out, it felt so terrible, dry, disgusting. Needless to say, I was infuriated. I couldn&#x27;t even comb through my hair to dry it... I immediately grabbed a shower cap and a deep conditioner and completely soaked my hair &amp; left it on all night. The next morning, I rushed to wash my hair to see if there was any improvement. None. My hair looked awful, it felt horrible, and major, major amounts of it were coming out in the shower, when i brushed it, etc. I wanted to cry.      I jumped online to see if anyone else had gone through this problem, and that&#x27;s when I found the reviews, forums, complaints about girls who ruined their hair thinking it would actually make it BETTER. I was angry. I tried to find a solution anyone had come up with, so i could fix my poor hair. No one had found one yet. Plenty of people commenting that they bought super expensive conditioners, leave-in treatments, ANYTHING that could help, and still, their hair was in the worst shape. Bummed out, I simply decided i was going to have to chop it all off if I was to have any hope in seeing hair that I could even wear down again.    First though, I went to Walmart to see if they had any deep conditioners I could try. I bought everything I could find- hot oil treatments, hair mayonnaise; you name it, I bought it.  I tried all of the conditioners, and nothing. Still hair that I couldn&#x27;t comb through. I&#x27;m not saying these conditioners don&#x27;t work, but I feel like my hair was so irreparable that they didn&#x27;t stand a chance.... however, ONE product DID finally help.      It&#x27;s called Hask Placenta Oil. Now, I know what you&#x27;re thinking- \\&quot;GROSS.\\&quot; That&#x27;s exactly what I thoughtwhen I saw it, and I couldn&#x27;t imagine putting PLACENTA oil on my HEAD. But, I bought it and decided to look up the reviews on it to see. Hey, I was desperate. I used everything I could before getting to the placenta oil... I wanted anything else to work. Anyway, none of them did. So, I looked online to read the reviews on this disgusting stuff. And to my surprise, people were RAVING about it. My first thought was, \\&quot;Crazy hippies!\\&quot; :P but, as i read through the reviews, i realized that they were girls, just like me- that damaged their hair, had tried everything, and resorted to this product(and fell in LOVE with it.)    Now, I am not being paid to promote for any company, and I can&#x27;t STAND illegitimate reviews... so please don&#x27;t think this is some paid ad. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s just a girl who found something that finally fixed my hair from the EVIL blow dry smoothing kit. I wish I had found this as soon as it happened.    Things you should know: it is not human placenta, it is goat placenta OIL- as in, not the actual THING- the nutrients from it. This eased my mind (and my gag reflex) enough to be able to use it. Also, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and you will THANK me for pointing you to it. I had to use it 2-3 times, but then I could finally WEAR MY HAIR DOWN AGAIN! It&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s been about a month since I started using this product, and my hair is back to the way it was- healthier even! :)      So really, if this product ruined your life as much as it did mine, go grab some of this stuff at walmart and give it a try. It&#x27;s CHEAP! And good luck!    Oh, and i&#x27;m never trusting this company (Garnier) with my hair again.</li>
    <li> I have very damaged hair curly hair, and i bought this product thinking it would help cut down my blow dry/straightening time. That definitely didn&#x27;t happen. My hair is now extremely dry and breaks off when anything pulls on it. Take it from me, do NOT try this on your hair.</li>
    <li> FOLLOW UP - after 7 washes -    I posted my first review below after just a few washes.  I&#x27;ve now completed the full seven washes and also tried air drying a few times.  I&#x27;ve dropped by one star mainly b/c no matter what I did, I did not see much of a reduction in blow dry time, which was a promised effect.  However, even at 7 washes, air drying on a humid day, and exposure to rain, there is still NO FRIZZ and my straightening, when coupled with a flatiron, lasts with no frizz until my next wash (I wash every 2-3 days).  I think this product should be relabeled as a frizz reducing treatment, not as reducing blow dry time.    One important thing I&#x27;ve noticed upon air drying today (7th wash day) is that my hair is not as curly as it was. It&#x27;s merely wavy.  Frankly, it does not look as good as it does when I blow it straight.  Still no frizz -- but not really the nice curl that was there.  I don&#x27;t like this.  I saw a review of this product in this month&#x27;s IN STYLE magazine, and it said that this product contains a moderate (mild?) straightener -- perhaps the thiol?  I think that review is accurate, at least for me - my hair is not as curly, but the in-between state is blah.  I guess I need to straighten it.    I&#x27;m really surprised that the reviews are so extreme and all the damage people report.  Maybe Garnier really needs to emphasize a strand test with this, so that you can see if the ingredients will cause breakage.  I&#x27;m lucky in that my hair actually looks better &amp; more shiny (b/c it holds the straightening, which reflects light).    Hope this and the text below is helpful!     this portion below is my first review  I wish I&#x27;d discovered this product earlier in the summer! It is timesaving for me in that it allows me to remain frizz free, straight, and smooth for far longer than my regular hair routine, even in humid conditions. I&#x27;d contemplated the so-called \\&quot;brazilian blowout\\&quot; many times this summer--my stylist has really been pushing it--but I was put off by thechemicals, the cost, the time commitment to do it, the special shampoos, the fact that salt water could deactivate it, etc.  For me, this product, at this cost and short time, with great results, seems to be a wonderful, affordable substitute.   More below.    I tried this product for 1st time on 8/15/2010.  In case this is helpful in evaluating it, here is what I started with:  collarbone length, dark brown very thick, curly hair that is both colored (to cover gray) and highlighted (partial foil). Normally, it takes me about 20 minutes to blow dry, using KMS straightening cream and Morrocan oil, and this will still frizz up a bit if it&#x27;s really humid that day. On subsequent days it might stay sort of straight, depending on the weather, but it generally does not even straighten from blowdrying on really humid days.   My hair prior to treatment (and after treatment) is in great condition, if a bit dry. I had refreshed/toned my highlights previously on 8/1/2010 with an application of Natural instincts, so I had let the 2 weeks elapse between coloring and trying this product.    I agree the smell of the 1st step was truly yucky - reminds me of a home perm from the 80&#x27;s. I was very worried at first b/c of this. My hair did feel a bit rough at first after rinsing it, probably because I one cannot use conditioner.  It felt better when the 2nd product was applied before blowdrying, although my hair felt \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; and a bit \\&quot;sticky\\&quot;.  My blow dry time was not shortened dramatically - perhaps 15 minutes instead of 20 to straighten my hair.  I did not follow up with flatiron until a few hours later.  What I noticed during blow dry is that it was much easier to straighten; even without the large round brush I use, I could pull my hair straight with my hands as I got most of the water out, and got it fairly smooth, straight, and dry within 1st 5 minutes of blow dry. I probably could have stopped there &amp; been pretty straight, but I went for the full straightening routine, with round brush &amp; concentrator, to see how good it would look.  It looked as straight as my stylist gets it pre-flatiron.    The real best part of this product is in the days following blow dry. Each day, even the humid ones, I would wake up up with my hair just as smooth and frizz free as it was when I dried it.  I normally wash my hair every 2-3 days, so as of today (8/24), I&#x27;ve washed it twice since applying the product 9 days ago (thus I&#x27;ve not reached 7 shampoos yet) -- am due to wash it today, but it still looks quite nice, honestly.  My hair still remains very frizz free and my straightening \\&quot;holds up\\&quot; as well as a salon blow dry.  I&#x27;ve gone to the beach, walked in drizzle for a few minutes, been exposed to 100% humidity for past three days - still ZERO frizz since washing it two days ago on a rainy day (followed by blow dry and flatiron).  I&#x27;ve been accidentally squirted with water, which normally would cause that section to curl right up, but not after using this product. It still takes nearly 15 minutes to blow dry (using my usual KMS and morrocan oil products), but the results are far straighter, smoother, and shinier than I ever got before.  I almost don&#x27;t need the flatiron.  Also, I can get my hair mostly very straight within my initial 5 minutes of blow drying (where I get hair to 80% dry) just by pulling my hair up and out with my hands and moving the dryer nozzle around it.  For the last 10 minutes, I use a dryer with a concentrator &amp; round brush, and the results look almost as good as a salon blowout (to me at least).  My hair does not feel \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; as it did when I initially applied the 2nd step of this product.    I don&#x27;t understand the comments about this product causing damage.  I have processed hair and have seen no damage whatsoever.  In fact, my hair seems to look healthier, because it is so frizz free.  What I want to know is how frequently I can use it.  I definitely plan to use it again.   I will post again after I&#x27;ve reached the 7 shampoos, to report on how well the product lasts.</li>
    <li> I bought and used this product without researching-BIG MISTAKE!  I have long, thick, course, healthy hair that does get frizzy in humid weather.  I saw this product advertised in a magazine, went to the store, bought it &amp; used it when I returned home.  First off-the smell!  My kids came into my room &amp; asked me if someone died in there.  Second-when I was blow drying my hair, it was breaking off.  I was staring in disbelief that I was so stupid as to use this without doing research.  I even tried a really good deep conditioner since this junk dried my once beautiful hair out so badly.  Didn&#x27;t work.  I hope I can save another poor soul from using this horrible product.  If I could give it no stars, I would.  DO NOT USE!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am a BzzAgent and was given a full size product of Garnier Sleek &amp; Shine Blow Dry Perfector to try. I was excited to think that I might find something to tame my frizz! Texas humidity really does a number on my hair so I was determined to find something to smooth it and make it look nice and sleek. Unfortunately, this was not the product to do that.    After following the instructions exactly, I still ended up with horribly dry hair with the texture of an animal&#x27;s. I did not save time and feel like I would even like some of the time I spent trying it repeatedly back. I still had to use a flat iron just to get it to look halfway smooth. The product instructions even mention using a flat iron, so doesn&#x27;t that defeat the purpose of a multi-step straightener when you still end up using a flat iron? I use other Garnier Fructis products with success, but this product did not work at all. The smell was overwhelming strong and grotesque. I have used hair straighteners (like a perm solution but to make the hair straight) without concern for the odor, but this one was beyond anything I have smelled. Couple that with the fact that after I rinsed out the product, my hair felt like a Halloween wig made of straw or plastic! I couldn&#x27;t even get a brush through it. The cream to use for the 2nd step allowed me to finish the task, but it wasn&#x27;t long standing. As soon as heat was applied, that straw-type texture was back and it felt like a brillo pad. My hair is extremely dry. As a professional, I can&#x27;t even stand to go out in public and feel like it has taken countless products to try and revive it.    There are many products out there, and I appreciate I was able to try mine for free as a BzzAgent, but it doesn&#x27;t excuse the horrible condition it left my hair in.</li>
    <li> First of all, I didn&#x27;t have the issues and damage described by most people.  I do get my hair professionally highlighted and decided to go the cautious route and wait 4 weeks rather than 2 (like the box suggested) before I used this the first time.  I received this product for free from a promotional campaign and was excited to see how it would work on my wavy, frizzy hair.    Application of this product was not fun.  It was really smelly the the provided gloves were very oversized.  It did seem to make my hair blow dry faster but necessarily easier.  I did notice less frizzies when I dried my hair naturally but not so few that I thought I could leave my hair natural.  I still preferred to wear it straight.</li>
    <li> I bought this product, not on Amazon, but at Walgreens on a whim. Once I got home, I read the reviews and was terrified. However, I didn&#x27;t want to waste it, and there were a few favorable reviews, so I tested it first on a small piece of hair from the bottom layers of the back. My hair seemed to be smoother, so I used the treatment on all of my hair. I was shocked at how well it worked. I just completed the treatment, so I will write later how it was after each washing.    Pros:  Hair is softer, shinier and smoother  Blow dried faster  No frizz    Cons:  Sulfur smell, though this is not as bad as described by some other reviewers, and does not linger on hair after rinsed.  Some lightening of color, though nothing more than would be expected after several shampooings (I color my hair)    Verdict: I would buy this product and test a small patch first, as I did. It&#x27;s worth it to know if you can use this much cheaper alternative to the Brazilian Blowout. My hair is curly-wavy and healthy, though somewhat coarse. It may not work for all hair types (as evidenced by the plethora of negative reviews).</li>
    <li> Well I have to say Im glad I caved in and tried it out after all the negative feedback I read on here.  Im beginning to wonder if the bad reviews are from companies that make there money off of salon brizilian blowouts!  To scare women off from trying this product.     I gave it 4 stars because it did exactly as it said.  I did many perms in the 80&#x27;s and the smell is nothing compared to the 2hr wait with curlers and permeating smell of a perm that last for days on end.  The bad smell disappeared after applying the 2nd bottle of cream.    There was very little hair breakage.  I had highlights done 3wks ago and the color was not tampered.  The drying time was just the same (reason not 5 stars), but the flat ironing was twice as fast.  The out come so far( i just did it today) shiny, soft, straight, but not like picture on box. But Im happy with the result!    I used just 1/2 of the serum and 3/4 of the cream.  Love the outcome. Higly recommended. Will deffinitely do again!</li>
    <li> I received this product for free to try as a BzzAgent. My hair is pretty difficult to dry because I have a lot of it and it holds a lot of water. After applying the contents, I was very happy with the result. My hair was not only easier to dry but definitely straighter as well. I noticed a lot less frizz today, and everyone has asked me if I gotten a blow-out. The only downside is the smell of the 20 min application. It smells a little different than hair dye, but the directions clearly state that this is normal. Very pleased. Would purchase.</li>
    <li> As a BzzAgent, I received a free sample of this product to try and review. I was initially very excited to try this product. I have frizzy, wavy hair and I usually straighten my hair daily with a blow dryer and a hair straightener. After I applied the serum to my hair, the awful smell was almost unbearable. Though I have morning sickness right now, I almost threw up when the serum was in my hair! It smells like something rotten and even after the serum was rinsed out of my hair, my hair still smelled until about 2 shampoos later. I didn&#x27;t even see any results when I straightened my hair. My hair required the same amount of work as it normally did to get it straight, and it did not appear any shinier or healthier. I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> I used the product two days ago and my hair is ruined. It left my hair feeling like I had super glue in it. It is dry, damaged and sticky feeling. I cant even comb it without it ripping my hair out because it is all matted together. I am furious! I will never buy another garnier product again! My hair is still frizzy too! If you use this product, it will ruin your hair. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> BAD BAD product.  It trashed my ends and I still have to use the flat iron everytime.  I missed the point.  What was this product supposed to do? (Other than drying and damaging my hair?)  DO NOT USE!!!!</li>
    <li> Talk about false advertising!  The package says it lasts for \\&quot;up to 7 shampoos.\\&quot;  Well, it took that long to get the stink out of my hair.  The instructions claim you can wear your hear in its usually curly/wavy style at any time.  Good luck with that.  My hair has been limp and feels like straw since using this product about six weeks ago.  I can no longer style it without ironing it, which is leaving it even less healthy.  I went to the salon for a deep conditioning treatment and had several inches cut off, but it will be a couple of years before my long hair is completely grown out and back to normal.  It&#x27;s just awful.</li>
    <li> First of all, the serum smells horrible. The 20 minutes were really bad. Then secondly, this does not make your effort in blow drying and flat ironing any less. Hair appears to be much drier than if you had done blow dry/ flat ironing after a regular wash and conditioning. And even after the wash heat etc, I am still getting the putrid smell of the serum. I didnt like it.</li>
    <li> I read about this product in a magazine and decided to try it. I have really thick hair and I straighten it almost everyday. I admit- the smell is awful- but that&#x27;s what you get when you&#x27;re working with chemicals. I used a little more than half the bottle on the first step and let it sit for 20 minutes. I rinsed in warm water for a good 2-3 minutes. When I went to comb it out- I did notice it was a little more tangled than usual- but not enough that I worried about it.   I applied the second step when my hair was towel dried and let it sit for a couple of minutes before blow drying. It did dry faster than usual, but I didn&#x27;t notice any real change on the waviness of my hair. Its really thick and the sections close to my scalp are kind of kinky curly. No change there. However, it was a lot easier to straighten. Instead of going over a section 4-5 times, I was able to straighten in 1-2 times with the hot iron.  I probably won&#x27;t use the product again- but only because it&#x27;s pretty spendy for what it is. I paid $10.99 for it at Target and to do that every 7 washes seems a little pricey for me.</li>
    <li> I also wish I would have read the reviews before buying and using this product.  I have shoulder length fine hair, but it can be a little curly and frizzy.  I thought this product would make it smoother.  It broke tons of my hair off and has left the texture like straw.  My hair only grows around 1/2 inch a month.  I used this product  4 months ago and at the front of my hair I have 4 inch pieces that stick straight up now.  My husband keeps saying what is wrong with your hair it looks so unhealthy.  It is even thinner then ever due to so much breakage.  I look horrible in short hair or I would cut if all off.  This is going to take years to recover from.</li>
    <li> Do Not buy!!!! I like Garnier, but this is wrong in every way. Just to be clear, I have long curly hair and I like to straighten every time I wash, and I did follow direction, this is not my first time buying a product, ok? So if you want your hair ruined and burned to death, if you want to damage it to no way out, use it! Bad, bad stuff....  It took me so long to get my hair back to normal, it takes lots of deep conditioning, I used Deeeep by Bumble and Bumble and its getting there slowly, I wish they would stop selling it....It smells like very strong perm chemicals and it tangles your hair....I cant go on, it makes me mad.... Do yourself a favor...Dont buy!</li>
    <li> Just a fore-warning. Don&#x27;t use this product if you&#x27;ve had your hair relaxed with no-lye or lye product in the past year. If your hair is not healthy (and not according to YOUR standard, ask your stylist), don&#x27;t use this product. If you have wavy hair, don&#x27;t use product. There&#x27;s a picture on the back of the box stating what hair you can use it on. USE THIS AS A GUIDE. Wavy hair could possibly be damaged using this. Picture Hallie Berry hair and you&#x27;re fine.     Usually, I don&#x27;t write Amazon reviews, because the products I buy on here are ones that I don&#x27;t want to pay a ton of $$ for in stores. I bought this at my local Shaws at 50% off, so around $5.     I used this last night and decided, while I was waiting for my hair to dry after I washed the serum out of my hair, to take a look at reviews.     I was immediately scared. I read all these reviews about how bad it was for your hair, how damaged it made seemingly healthy hair and I was immediately worried. I have healthy hair, my stylist often says she wishes people took care of my hair as I do. But, I figured, there&#x27;s no turning back. So I completed all the steps and was pleasantly surprised at how NICE my hair looks.     First, a few facts about my hair. I have type 3B curly hair, dark brunette that lightens when in sunshine for a couple hours. It&#x27;s a long-layered reverse bob. My hair is frizzy during the summer, no matter what Ouidad I buy. I treat my hair as if it was a child, a very stubborn child. I use little to no products in my hair and only use products formulated specifically for curly hair. This includes, but is not limited to, the Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine line, Tresemme foam-activated dry shampoo, Ouidad products and Dove Intense Moisture.     My hair&#x27;s drying time didn&#x27;t die down a whole ton, maybe five or more minutes. But the time it took to regularly straighten my hair was practically cut in half. As I said, I did it last night, so I basically fell asleep a little afterwards and woke up late. LATE and I had to straighten? Usually, I&#x27;d just throw it up in a ponytail, but as I ran my straightener through my hair, I was relieved (and surprised) to find that it didn&#x27;t take long at all. I usually don&#x27;t straighten my hair, not on a regular basis anyway (the last time I did was in early May). So, I decided to tell you all how I used this product:    1.) Shampooed my hair, didn&#x27;t condition. Threw it into a turbi-towel but didn&#x27;t actually towel-dry (as that is HORRIBLE for curly hair). Instead, I left in my turbi-towel while I brushed my teeth/got dressed, etc. then I took it out and let it air dry.     2.) Put on those gloves and carefully put the serum into my hair. I practically got none on the scalp, I used the ponytail method to distribute it, then while I had little to no serum in my hair, would rake my hair back with my fingers. I definitely didn&#x27;t use all the serum, maybe 3/4 of the bottle (I have very thick hair).     3.) Rinsed my hair out with lukewarm to warm water for a good ten minutes. Threw it up in another turbi-towel and took it down ten minutes later to air dry. BONE DRY is how you want it.      4.) Ran the lock-in moisture serum throughout my hair. It says to lightly coat it, so I did. I definitely only used a little less than half the bottle. Wondering if I could use it again after a couple washes. DO NOT use any other product with this. Don&#x27;t use a heat-tamer spray or anything else. IT WILL RUIN YOUR HAIR. This product is made to act like all these.     5.) MOST IMPORTANT: You have to dry your hair before straightening. If you don&#x27;t own a straightening attachment already, go out and buy one. I got mine with my Conair hair-dryer along with the diffuser. It directs the airflow into a vertical rectangle. That&#x27;s what you want. You wont&#x27; get the same results without this attachment.     6.) After you blow-dry your hair completely, take your trusty flat-iron to it. As always, run it through small sections from top to bottom, not moving too quickly.it took me 1-2 tries on each section to get it to the desired &#x27;straightness.&#x27;     Poof, you&#x27;re done! If you don&#x27;t want to &#x27;poo&#x27; your hair the next day, use some skinny serum (aka: Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Skinny Serum, a must have for any curly-girl&#x27;s shelf) and run it through your hair. I used two pumps of it each for the right side, left side, and back. Then I ran my straightener through and sprayed my hairbrush with my anti-humidity spray (Garnier&#x27;s is the best) and ran that through. Again, very straight and manageable. No more of this having to practically re-straighten my  hair mid-day through to get it sleek.     My hair isn&#x27;t damage, it&#x27;s smooth and soft. My mother&#x27;s already commented on how much better it looks compared to the regular straightening.     The reason I give this four stars? The serum STINKS and it&#x27;s a bit of a long process. (You figure 20 minutes for the serum, 20 for blow-dry, and 30-45 for straightening tacks it to about 1.5 hours thereabouts).     Otherwise, i really like it. I might buy one more and keep it around until the holidays. But, so long as you stick to directions you should have no problem. :)</li>
    <li> First off, I feel really bad for the people that had their hair damaged from this product. I&#x27;m actually now amazed (and thankful) that my hair DIDN&#x27;T get damagaged.   I have medium length, fine-textured, medium-density, naturally wavy hair that is prone to damage because my hair is naturally dark blonde which I lighten to light-medium blonde.   After I shower, it usually takes me about 5-10 minutes to blowdry and then 25 minutes to straighten and seal the cuticle. My hair (after years of coloring and straightening) is still moderately damaged and can never seem to be perfectly smooth and glossy after straighteing so I decided to try this product. The first step smells really bad, I must say, sort of like a mix between perm and eggs. The second part, the blow dry cream, smelled much better. I did spray a little bit of leave in conditioner so that I could get a comb through, since you aren&#x27;t supposed to condition it while using the product. I let my hair air-dry till it was 50% dry and it was so soft and the wave was undeniably relaxed. I then finished blowdrying and then used my straightener, to basically \\&quot;seal the deal\\&quot;. It only took about 10-15 to straighten and it was so sleek, smooth, soft and glossy. I was amazed. The next morning, I woke up and instead of having to run the straighening iron through it, like usual, it was already good to go and pin straight. I only wash my hair every 2-3 days (using a shower cap when I shower) so this product worked about 3 weeks saving me lots of time getting ready each day. To me, that was worth the first day or 2 smelling like eggs, lol, which I masked with a touch of perfume (do not spray directly on hair, the alcohol content is way too high, I spray high above my head and let the mist fall onto hair). I use moraccan oil, which smells amazing and helped with the awful but temporary bad smell, before I blow dry normally and continued to use during the 3 weeks of using this product. Another reviewer stated that using a straighter and products defeats the point of this product but that is how it is intended to be used. For me, it worked exactly the way I hoped and exactly the way it said it would on the box. I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t read the reviews before using it, I might have been scared off.   I last used it about 5 weeks ago and am planning on using it again in the near future. I guess people just have different hair types and textures so while this may work for some, it may not work for others.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally review things on Amazon but I kinda felt like I should stick up for this product since it worked fine for me. It&#x27;s been about a week since I&#x27;ve used it in my hair and I haven&#x27;t really noticed anything bad. The box says that it&#x27;s one application but I only used the half the bottle, maybe that was why I didn&#x27;t have a negative reaction? I live in Hawaii and humidity is always a problem but after I put this in my hair, it was pretty smooth and shiny, looking even better after I flat-ironed it. I went to the beach twice and it didn&#x27;t turn my hair green or dry it out, I even let it air dry (which I almost never do) and my hair was much more tamer than usual.     The obvious downside is the stench, it smells SO BAD...like an old lady perm. Definitely taking away a star for that! The smell lingers a little bit but after two or three washes, it went away. I also noticed that it didn&#x27;t cut back my drying time, like it claims it does. I&#x27;m taking away another star because based on the other reviews, I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend this product to my friends. It seems like it has varied results and I wouldn&#x27;t want to take the risk. Do a strand test before applying!</li>
    <li> Thinking this was a temporary product (since it washes out in 7 washes according to the package), and already very impressed with Garnier&#x27;s other products from the Triple Nutrition line, I purchased the Blow Dry Perfector Kit and followed the instructions to the &#x27;T&#x27;. Did notice it smelled very much like the \\&quot;real\\&quot; chemicals used during perming/japanese straightening but assumed it couldn&#x27;t really be anything drastic, since again, it&#x27;s supposed to wash out...right? First signs of something going terribly wrong was after I washed out the Step 1 liquid after 20 mins. My hair, which was previously wavy and soft, had become extremely frizzy, very dry to the touch and was breaking off about half an inch from the ends. Tried not to panic and continued with the Step 2 lotion and realised that my hair had become really damaged, almost impossible to comb through without breaking off more ends and it took me almost an hour to blow dry somewhat straight. Previously it would take me 10 minutes max. My hair was now almost the same texture as a bristles on a brush. I was running late for an important meeting and despite being almost in tears, went ahead still hoping that my hair would anyway return to its normal state in 7 washes. Tried washing the next day and realised the damage was really severe. I have shoulder length hair and the worst damaged areas go up almost 5 inches from the ends, which is almost 75% of my hair. Decided to check Amazon reviews to see if anyone else had experienced this and was absolutely shocked to see how more than 85 people had had similar experiences with this product....and that it was PERMANENT!!! I cannot understand how a company like Garnier, whose tag line says \\&quot;Take Care\\&quot; and markets itself as a company producing products that are better for your hair would not just sell a product like this but CONTINUE to do so, despite all the negative experiences people have had with it. If the product simply didn&#x27;t work, and consumers didn&#x27;t experience any improvement after using it, I could still understand. But selling something which has irrepairably damaged hair....I cannot fathom why this is being sold at all. I am still not sure what I should do with my hair. Whether to chop it all off or continue to tie it in a bun for the next year till it grows out again. I do feel that Garnier should come back with a public apology and explanation, not to mention compensation for those of us who bought this product out of pure trust and have now had to deal with the emotional trauma and embarassement for months going forward.    Update: 5/16/2011  It&#x27;s been over a week now and despite buying Moroccan Oil as well as Nexxus Pro-Mend products (have now spent about $150 dollars), my hair is an explosion of dry, brittle, frizzy strands which needs to be blow dried and then flat ironed to look less unruly. Not to mention all the breakage that happens during this process. I have to do this almost every day now since by Day 2 post shampoo, it becomes a knotted mess. I think I might just have to chop it all off and I&#x27;m terrified since I&#x27;ve had long hair for more than 20 years now....I did write to Garnier who responded and requested I contact customer service to \\&quot;determine how best to assist me\\&quot;. I shall make that call today but quite frankly, am not sure how they can sufficiently address something as traumatic as this...</li>
    <li> I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this product. I have wavy hair, but it doesn&#x27;t look very good if I don&#x27;t style it. This product smells really bad, almost as bad as the chemical straightening stuff I used two years ago. When I was doing it, my boyfriend knocked the door to check in, and sprang away when I opened the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, it does not work that well. I thought I did not have to do anything for my hair for the next 7 shampoos, but well, I was wrong. I still have to blow dry and style my hair, but what is the point of using this product since I can already achieve great hair simply blowing dry my hair without using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it damages your hair. But again, all chemical styling products do.</li>
    <li> I was given this product thru BzzAgent to test. First off this product has the most awful smell to it, it is enough to make you sick at your stomach! Yes it is that bad. The product worked so-so to straighten my hair but now my hair feels like straw it seems really dry and it also seems a lot more \\&quot;fly away\\&quot;. I was really excited to try this product but it is just not worth the money or the smell. I cannot express how much this stuff just plain stinks!!</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!  I used it last night and it completely damaged my hair - I was left with extra dry hair that look so over processed that I can not even wear a pony tail. I need to go to the salon now and see if they can do anything to save my hair.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product, and I liked it. The smell was not good, that&#x27;s for sure, but there are plenty of beauty products that smell horrible but work. My hair is definitely smoother, and it has been 4 days since I used the product and I am still seeing the results.</li>
    <li> I received this to try as a bzz agent. My kit came and I was sooooo excited to try it. I have extremely long, wavy, thick hair. I live in a part of the country that uses evaporative coolers instead of central air conditioning. This method puts moisture in the air and therefore pooofs up my hair to high heaven in the summer time. This stuff smelled AWFUL but after the stench.... sleek, shiny, beautiful hair. I LOVED the result the first two days. I gave it 4 stars because it only lasted about 3 shampoos not the advertised 7 but while it lasted it was fantastic. My hair was manageable, shiny, bouncy, and it really felt great to the touch. I would buy it regularly if it were cheaper since you have to use it at least once every week.</li>
    <li> Like most other reviewers I wish I had checked the amazon reviews before purchasing this product. I have long, slightly wavy, healthy hair, and this ravaged it completely. I have to cut at least 5 inches off if not more to remove the brillo pad hair matt that this product morphed my hair into becoming. It not only smells horrible, but completely destroys your hair. I&#x27;m beyond disappointed in the product, I&#x27;m devastated. I thought this product would make my hair shiny, not turn my hair into a hay bale with split ends. It is unbelievable how horrible this product is. It should be taken off the market immediately. Save yourself the money, heartache and time spend getting an immediate haircut and trying to regrow and restore your ruined hair into something presentable. horrible horrible horrible. I wish I had a rewind button and never bought this evil junk.</li>
    <li> I have seen all of the horrible reviews, so I can only tell you my story.  I found this product in the clearance isle in Walgreens one day when i was just browsing.  I am of african american/ italien decent and my hair is very long, very very thick, course and hard to tame so I usually just wear my curls.  i decided to try this product because I thought it would be better than a relaxer.  I must admit, IT SMELLS AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!! the initial serum that is supposed to sit in your hair has a terrible stinch like nothing you&#x27;ve ever sniffed, But i noticed in the other reviews that I actually didnt follow instructions, I left the stinky serum in 30 minutes, then rinsed it out, and at that point, it absolutely feels like you have done nothing but stripped it of moisture so, i then put in a deep conditioner let that sit for about 15-20 mins, rinsed that out, added the blow drying cream, blew it dry and straightened it, and it stayed completely straight in 90 degree weather with high humididy all day long, it lasted sleek about 4 washes before it started to show signes or waywordness again... for me it lasted about 6 washes, but I used a deep penetrating conditioner with it, no breakage, my tips are colored and the color didnt change or fall out. so i gave it 4 stars because the smell is almost so bad that I wouldnt want to buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have no idea how this product got onto the shelves. I used it on my damaged hair, hoping it would help it look silkier. Basically my hair now looks like dreadlocks. Big bushy straw, it doesn&#x27;t even lay down. Its kinky, split ends, an absolute disaster. It also stripped out my color. BEWARE!</li>
    <li> This product will ruin your hair.  I used this product 3 months ago in hopes it would lessen the frizz in my naturally wavy/curly hair.  The first warning sign i should have heeded was the horrible smell, this is not a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product, this is a major chemical smell!  This is a perm or relaxer smell!  ANd let me tell you the smell does not go away, the second step smells better but the bad smell comes back and lingers for days.....in your house, your towels, your hair and your bathroom!  This product has ruined my hair.  I purchased this to help with frizz, never did it say it was a chemical long lasting relaxer, but that is EXACTLY what it has done and harshly too!  3 months now and I still have none of my natural wavy/curly back AT ALL, my hjair is dull, lifeless and looks like it has been stripped completely.  I have had to cut off 3 plus inches to try and get the most damaged ends off.  The rest I just have to deal with un til it grows back.  Please DO NOT TAKE THE RISK!!  It seems there are just too many horror stories about this product to take them lightly!  Garnier really needs to take another look at this product!!!!</li>
    <li> My hair WAS healthy.  All of hair is ruined and I have never experienced this sort of damage in my life. This product is irresponsible in the way it is being marketed to the public and defective as it does not wash out after shampooing -reason being, it&#x27;s basically a perm.     I have so far spent 1000 dollars trying to undo some of the trauma that this 10 dollar product has caused... An entire day at a salon to have basically all of my hair cut off and my stylist recommended that I get a wig.   When your stylist recommends a wig you know you are done.. There is no hope of recovering (in terms of hair).  Anyway, needless to say I have a wig for work.  The real issue is that I am now a recluse; I don&#x27;t want to go anywhere other than work and home, I feel unattractive and I am embarrassed!  I have a buzz cut and a wig - not sure what is worse!</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading about it in a magazine. As I was waiting the 20 min before rinsing I decided to look up reviews and got really scared when I saw all the horror stories. I thought about rinsing it out right then to try to undo the damage. But I decided they wouldn&#x27;t put a product out on the market if it made everyone&#x27;s hair fall out. That would ruin their company&#x27;s reputation.    and everything turned out fine!! My hair was definately less frizzy and less poufy after blow drying it. It doesn&#x27;t look damaged. My hair looks shiny and sleek. It didn&#x27;t take less time to dry but I hardly had to use the straightener at all so overall it was a much quicker process.    I think the bad reviews might be planted by salon owners or someone else with an ulterior motive. Or maybe these people didn&#x27;t read the warnings and had recently colored their hair. I don&#x27;t know. But I didn&#x27;t want everyone to miss out on this product. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t have bought it if I read the reviews first.</li>
    <li> IF you value your hair and sanity-please do not use this horrible misleading product. Can be used after waiting 2 weeks from the day of coloring,bleaching..etc. I think not. This stuff seems simple to use, and it is. Simple to get rid of...no! How can a \\&quot;relaxer\\&quot;, if you will, wash out!? It doesn&#x27;t. You are stuck with dry, fraying ends and an all over \\&quot;weird\\&quot; feeling.By weird feeling I mean this: When the hair is dry it feels \\&quot;bloated\\&quot;...very fat and heavy-why? Because its ruined!! It does feel like silk..until you attempt to blow dry. YOU CAN&#x27;T BLOW DRY IT!! IT takes forever and feels like its going to snap-and does. If you take a strand while wet and start to dry it...you will actually see it stretch out then..SNAP!! There&#x27;s the frizzed end. Imagine that on every.single.strand.of hair. True. I&#x27;ve used garnier products and like them so I&#x27;m not on a &#x27;smear campaign&#x27;,this product is just lethal. I have thick curly/wavy hair. I just wanted some relief from the humidity and the frizzing and a rest from using the straightener or curling iron. What I got was a damaged head of hair with no relief in sight. I can&#x27;t even go to the salon to get it cut yet!! ITs clearly full of the \\&quot;chemical&#x27;s\\&quot;, it feels sticky and thick and coated when it is dry! I mean frizzing and cotton ball like!!!! I need to wait until the \\&quot;7 Shampoos\\&quot; as if. Its going to take time and time only to get this stuff out. I have washed and washed and conditioned and deep conditioned to no avail. As I type I am setting here with a towel on my hair waiting to see if the latest concotion has worked-DOve Intensive Treatment shampoo and cond. plus Aussie 3 min miralce...PLUS John Feida-full Repair Deep Infusion. *fingers crossed* something comes from it! I haven&#x27;t had the horrible smells most people have commented about-(oh wow..a bonus:P )it smelled bad going on-think perm solution-I should of known! I have my 20 yr high school reunion in..3 days. What now? I loved my hair before, I just wanted what was shown on the box...a sleek and shiny do for the next 7 days. Couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong. I may have to go to my reunion with some crazy up do and sprayed to my head so the ends dont stick up like fuzzy slippers! No point in contacting garnier-I know the drill.... send this and complete this and sorry, read the box and blah blah blah. I can tell you this, I will make it known to Every last person I talk to that this product is life changing crap. I will probably never use a garnier product ever as of now on either. why? why not!? I get the warning labels and such on hair products, but seriously-its a lie. I do have highlighted hair-Its been months!! It fried the highlighted hair...and the untouched, non color treated hair. EVERY STRAND WAS RUINED. Well, that being said and I could go on about how terrible this is but I wont. Instead I have to go and check what&#x27;s under the towel this trial run!!!  If anything works I will post!!! Good luck to any and all that have been duped by the so called product.</li>
    <li> This product worked great on my hair! I usually have some frizz and wave to my hair and after I blow dried my hair with this product in it, I didn&#x27;t even need to straighten it! It was shinny and straight and I got so many compliments! I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t read the reviews until after i used the product.  i will warn that the 20 minute serum really smells AWFUL.  like REALLY bad.  I have coarse, thick, curley hair so I somehow survived leaving the serum in for 25 minutes.  I have a wet-dry flat iron so I just used that because I dont use a hair dryer when i straighten my hair.  at first i was not happy, my hair was coarse and looked bad.  then i put some frizz-ease finishing creme in, slept on it, and the next morning it looked great!  i just shampooed it for the first time after doing the treatment and then just flat-ironed it and it looks even better this time.  easier to do and much shinier and nicer looking.</li>
    <li> I have been using Garnier products for years and have never been disappointed. So I purchased the Garnier Blow Dry Prefector hoping for positive results. BEWARE! It is the worst hair product on the market! Save your money and your hair and do not purchase it! I cannot believe this even passed R&amp;D without red flags everywhere. I tried it a week ago hoping to tame my frizzy, course and thick hair. It left my hair with severe breakage at the ends, stripped my expensive color, and worst of all, it left this repulsive smell in my hair that will not come out despite the numerous times I&#x27;ve washed it. Honestly, it&#x27;s really embarresing! I had a close friend of mine tell me it smelled like urine and another friend told me it smells like bad peanut butter. Jeez! To all women out there: KEEP AWAY!!!!</li>
    <li> I soooooooo hate this product. I bought it almost 8 month ago. It so fried my hair and after all care and nurturing it never came back in its beauty.   I was so mad. Wish I had read the reviews before I bought this in a grocery store.  It stunk ( foul eggs), yes, you get over that little issue. Second product made it a little better feeling ( so I thought). Nothing was sleek and shine. Mu hair was one wool ball, mushy, and thin. I touched it and had a bushel hair in my hand.  I had so long hair. Needed to get rid of some waves. Was just tired to blow dry and flat iron it.  Could have never damaged my hair with life long daily flat ironing like this product did.  No star if I could!</li>
    <li> I bought this product on impulse but then read the insert and directions. The warning about not using it on highlights, relaxed hair, within 2 weeks of hair coloring, scared me to death. It reminded me of a product my sister bought at CVS 2 years ago, same type of hype, can&#x27;t remember the company and it RUINED her hair...was like straw and she followed the directions. For her it took a few days to really dry out and she had to cut 2 inches off.  I thought it was more like a \\&quot;frizz-ez\\&quot; product and will trust the reviews here and \\&quot;eat the 10.00\\&quot;.     Thank you for backing up what I already surmised from the directions...a waste of time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product LAST Feb. (2011) in hopes that it would tame my hair and make it less wavy &amp; more straight. I applied the product just as the directions stated to and dried my hair &amp; as I was drying it, I noticed my hair felt almost gummy...and that every single strand was FRIED. I just sat there crying because it had ruined my hair. It was the longest that it had been in a long time and I was so sad that I had to go get it cut off... there was no other choice other than to walk around with fried nasty looking hair. Even 6 months later My hair was STILL not grown out all the way and the texture and split/dry ends were still happening. What a horrible product. Almost a year later and my hair is FINALLLY growing back and growing healthy. I really do not understand how a product like this is still on shelfs. It is literally the worst hair product I ever used in my life and I wish that I had never ever ever bought it!</li>
    <li> I just read the reviews and OMG. If I read these before I started using it before I bought it when it first came out I would have never tried it.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it on and off since it first came out. My hair is long, thick, and slightly wavy. It&#x27;s no where near damaged like all the other reviews say. I just did it yesterday, and yes I will say the smell is HORRIBLE. but my hair smells like my conditioner now and it&#x27;s non frizzy and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also haven&#x27;t died my hair in almost 4 months. the directions say don&#x27;t dye your hair within 14 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am unsure why so many people have been having problems because I haven&#x27;t and I don&#x27;t use a extra conditioner or anything unusual to make my hair healthier.</li>
    <li> Actually, it is beyond garbage because applying blended up trash would not destroy your hair like this horrible product did.  I do not know how this is on the shelf anymore.  The texture of my hair USED to be soft and manageable and now it is brittle, breaking off constantly, and becomes gummy when trying to blow dry it.  I attempt to blow dry it once a week to see if anything has changed and nada. I went to my stylist and he did what he could but told me that once the hair gets to a rubber band stage, there isn&#x27;t much to be done.  I air dry it now but it get HUGE and the ends look like each individual one was fried with a match. I will probably have to cut several inches off  and even then , it won&#x27;t be back to normal.  I truly believe the only real solution is to cut it off a couple of inches from the root and start over.... but I am way too insecure for that!</li>
    <li> This product seriously damaged my hair. It has been breaking off constantly... It made my hair feel terrible, and it looks greasy. The product made it horribly frizzy! It absolutely did not help to make it smoother or straighter in ANY way! I wish I would&#x27;ve never tried this awful product!</li>
    <li> When I saw this product I thought it would be great, boy was I wrong. Never ever buy this product it smells like a piece of poop dipped in amonia. It made my hair harder to straighten, super frizzy, and unbelievebly dry. I wasted my money on this stupid thing and want my money back. No where on the packaging or on the Amazon discription does it warn you of the smell. It stunk up my whole bathroom and my hair feels terrible! I will never buy any Garnier Fructies ever again, and I will only purchase books on Amazon from now on. I thought Amazon was supposed to help you, not sell you products that ruin your hair. I&#x27;m very very dissapointed in you Amazon!</li>
    <li> This product did exactly what I wanted - Smoothed the outer layer of my hair to tame frizz. My hair is curly and I always wanted to keep my curl without frizz.  This product is not a \\&quot;straightener\\&quot;  and does not claim to be - If you expect it to smooth and straighten, you will be dissapointed.  Now, when I style my hair, it is sleek, shiny curls.  I paid $100 to have a salon treatment with the same results, however that treatment lasted 8 weeks.  My beautician said it is absolutely necessary to use a shampoo and conditioner which are sodium and sulfate free because regular shampoos will strip product right away.  I am on my 6th day using the right shampoo and the product is still in my hair - I believe it will last twice as long - I will update you.</li>
    <li> The scent of the product is unbelievable FOUL!!  It smells like rotten eggs.  I put the product in to process then looked up reviews online.  I ran straight back to the shower to wash it out after only ten minutes due to the numerous bad reviews.  When I applied step 2, I could barely get a comb through my hair.  I was hoping the sweet scent of step 2 would take care of the horrific scent, but it did not.  It took me so long to dry my hair.  Using the flat iron was essentially the same without the product.    I will say that I do not appear to have the frizzy hairs at my scalp/part after using this product.  However, it&#x27;s 3 hours later and I still cannot stand the scent.  It makes my stomach turn.  I&#x27;ve tried putting scented lotion on my hair, but the rotten egg smell is just too strong.  I had to open my bathroom window to air out the room.    I would NEVER waste my money on this product again.</li>
    <li> I wanted to have an easier time straightening my hair. I followed the directions. It did stink but the directions warned about it so no big deal. I actually put rollers in my hair and then I used a blow dryer to straighten. The results were lack luster hair that was very dry and poofy. It wasn&#x27;t until a week later that I felt the bald spots... It was upsetting. My hair grows fairly quickly and the bald spots are still there. I had mostly 3c/3b- which to me means fine hair with tight coils. And I have a lot of hair. Its been a month since the discovery of the bald spots and they havent gone away and are in fact spreading wider.  My curls feel looser and my hair feels fragile and LESS. I am now afraid to put anything in my hair. I really wished I read these reviews before I purchased. Everyone is telling me I should sue the company but who knows how to do that? I just want my hair back the way it was before. Whats ironic about this whole experience was I was trying to tame my wild mane. Instead I think I broke it. :(</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe this!! I bought this at the store the other day because it was on sale. My hair has a natural wave to it, and I spend a lot of time blow drying and straightening it every day. Well, this product says it helps stubborn hair straighten easier.. I figured, why not!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had even a SINGLE split end for YEARS. In that time I&#x27;ve bleached, dyed, blow dried, flat ironed, and all out abused my hair. BUT, I always take good care of it. Even years ago when I&#x27;d bleach it once a month, for extended periods of time, I&#x27;d still walk away with 100%, healthy, shiny, soft, silky, split-end proof hair. I take SOOO much pride in my hair, its not even funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair went from super soft, shiny, silky, healthy, and amazingly awesome, to completely fried. I mean stretchy, breaking, horribly fried. Instantly. I&#x27;m honestly sitting here having a panic attack over how damaged my hair is after this treatment. I have a short A-line cut, the back ending just past the nape of my neck. I&#x27;m going to have to chop it WAY off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have checked the reviews on here first... no words can describe the horror I&#x27;m feeling right now. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!! Any amount of hair I had bleached before has grown out, and been cut off. It has been 3 weeks since I dyed my hair. I followed the directions exactly. I&#x27;m now looking at months of babying my hair, cutting it off,  and getting it back to the health that it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stop crying over my hair. I know it sounds petty, but I&#x27;ve always had perfect hair, I&#x27;m a horrible tomboy and my hair is my ONE girly thing that I take pride in and its gone. This is the worst product ever. There is not enough animosity in the world!! Don&#x27;t do it people! Just don&#x27;t do it!</li>
    <li> I have healthy hair and don&#x27;t sue products as a rule.  I have a lot of new hair growth that tends to be unruly and I had hoped this product would help.  I wish I had looked at the reviews here before buying it.     I recognized the ammonia smell as activator lotion (girls who were around in the 80s - you know what I&#x27;m talking about).  Since I don&#x27;t use product, I decided to leave it on only 10 minutes just to be sure it wasn&#x27;t too strong for my fine, dense, healthy hair.  That was a good decision.     As it turns out, when I rinsed my hair, about 1/4 of my total hair went down the drain.  It was awful.  When I part my hair now, instead of a thin line where the hair part lies, I have a strip of bare scalp - no matter where I part it.      So, it looks like I&#x27;ll be going to get my hair cut off.  Ladies, don&#x27;t listen to the 4 &amp; 5 star blatantly paid reviewers... unless you have too much hair and need to lose some, stay away from this product.</li>
    <li> Sadly there are a lot of upset hairdressers writing reviews.  I have never been so scared in my life.  I bought the product then read the reviews.  While I am so sorry about what other people say happened, I myself couldn&#x27;t be happier!  I have color treated, fine to medium hair down to my bra strap.  I used probably 1/3 of the nasty smelling step 1 stuff, it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as many described it, but definitely rotten eggy.  After ten minutes I went through it with a plastic comb to make sure it was even, then sat the other ten minutes.  I avoided anywhere within an inch of my scalp and rinsed for probably close to ten minutes, warm then hot and finished with cold.  I have never rinsed so long in my life but I tried to listen to what people it worked for said.  I used about 1/2 of step 2 and it definitely took way longer to blow dry, about 10-15 minutes.  I then flat ironed by small section first, then did larger sections, and went back one more time, something I never normally do, for a final style.  My hair naturally is straight, wave, curl, straight, wave, curl. It does nothing on it own.  I normally iron it straight and pray, occasionally curling it but it does nothing exciting on it&#x27;s own.  From one hour start to finish!  I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled with the result and plan on glossing spray to get rid of the final vestiges of the fragance.  It is a chemical process, so less is more, rinse until you can&#x27;t anymore, and what you put into it is what you will get out of it.  THIS IS THE HAIR I ALWAYS WANTED. Soft silky and manageable.  I will keep you posted as to what happens.  Thank you Garnier!!! muah!</li>
    <li> I really am wishing I would have looked online before I put this on my hair :( I put the step one on and it stripped part of my color out right off the bat. there is a place right in the front of my hair that is PURE WHITE. Aside from the color being all patchy now, I could feel my hair being really tangled and feeling really really dry even before rinsing out the step one, and then when I tried to comb it out, chunks of my hair broke off. There are awful looking places broken off about halfway up the length of my hair. After the step two part, it took an even longer time to blow dry, and it looks like hell because it&#x27;s frizzier than it was and broken. Thank God I have shorter hair, but I&#x27;m going to have to cut it shorter than I&#x27;d like to because of the mess this stuff made my hair into.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally review stuff - - I&#x27;m trying to WARN YOU OFF from making my mistake.  I followed the directions to the letter and my hair is completely and utterly damaged, and impossible to comb through...which, as a sidebar, makes it only more frizzy and unmanageable than before.  Garnier should pull this from the shelves and should be ASHAMED of themselves for all the heads they&#x27;ve ruined.</li>
    <li> So I tried this product thinking it would deep condition my hair and make it sleek and soft.... What a mess! I have naturally big wavy hair, and it turn it into a ratty mess. So after crying about it and hiding my hair for two days I finally discovered on a random blog how to get it out. I should have known, because I have done this a million times to tone down dyed hair. Go to your local health food store or GNC and pick up apricot and jojoba oil. The first night I put them in my hair for two hours and washed with a dandruff shampoo, and it softened it up a ton. Then second time I left in over night, and washed it out in the morning once again washing with a dandruff shampoo and deep conditioning. Voila! Soft and wavy :) I&#x27;m not sure if it all came out, but I know if I do it one more time it should take whatever is left.... WHAT A RELIEF!!!! DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!</li>
    <li> This product caused massive breakage at my hairline and my overall hair thickness is reduced by 50%. It has been over a month, and my hair continues to break off close to the roots. I can not even wear it up due to the amount of damage and the frizzy short pieces that now stick out. I had thick curly hair prior to using this product. I have had such extensive damage that I had to cut over 12 inches off. It still looks horrible and will take a very long time to grow back. Do not risk using this prduct. Also, the customer service continues to refer me to a toll free number that does not accept calls, so I can&#x27;t even make a complaint to the company.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but I need to warn everyone against this product...its awful! I put it on my hair and immediately there was a terrible smell, my entire house smelled and people wouldn&#x27;t even come near me it smelled so bad. My hair started to fall out a lot, it was weighed down and did nothing for my hair as far as straightening. I tried tomato juice, baby powder, baking soda, everything to get the smell out...4 days after i used it it still smells awful and my hair is ruined. Save your money and your hair. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
    <li> NEGATIVE 58 STARS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do youself and your hair a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I have no idea where these people came from that gave such great reviews, but my experience was horrible and so was my daughter&#x27;s, as well as 2 other friends who tried this product. OMG my hair is RAVAGED! The texture is awful, it is extrememly dry, it is not sleek ad smooth at all. It looks and feels like crap. Drying time is not reduced and you still have to use your normal products that you use when you straighten your hair and you still have to use a straightening iron. This product is a complete waste of money and an utter failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product as instructed. Washed, but didn&#x27;t condition my hair and then applied the \\&quot;20 Minute Serum.\\&quot;  The serum stinks!! It smells just like a perm or relaxer, only stronger! I rinsed it out after 20 minutes without shampooing or conditioning as instructed. My hair felt totally damaged at this point. As soon as I rinsed the serum I could tell an absolute and total change in the texture of my hair and it was not good at all! It was almost impossible to comb out, so I added in some of the 2nd step cream hoping it would make a difference and make it easier to comb out. It did. At first I thought \\&quot;Ah, that&#x27;s much better\\&quot; because it did actually make a difference - my hair felt much better and I could comb through it now. My hair also smelled much better after applying the 2nd step cream, thank goodness! Well, as soon as I started blow drying my hair I could tell the damage was still totally present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had so much broken hair and hair falling out it wasn&#x27;t even funny. I was really really p*ssed off. My hair is long - almost to my butt, wavy and very healthy. I have done perms in the past and even chemical/permanent straighteners and I have never ever experienced this much damage and my hair has never felt this bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to blow dry your hair straight and then use a straightening iron to get it totally straight. Well that right there defeats the purpose of the product! Anyway, I did this as instructed without using any of my other usual products. Ugh, it was horrible. I decided to use one of my favorite products for straightening my hair in hopes that I could get better results. I used Matrix Gold Heat spray which normally makes my hair so silky soft and smooth. Well not this time! My hair feels almost frizzy.. like each individual strand seems damaged. It is so dry. I have these little 1-2 inch pieces of broken hair that stick up everywhere now. I have fly aways like crazy. I am so mad right now just thinking about it! My Gold Heat helped a little, but not much. My hair still feels horrible. Also, as I was straightening with the iron, some sort of gunky build up was accruing on the plates of my iron. Of course my hair would stick to it and break off. I had to scrub it off of the plates. I have never had that happen with any other hair products! This Garnier has been a total nightmare. I soo wish I never tried it! My hair feels over processed, rough, dry and generally awful. I know several people who have tried this product and they all had the same results. That is too much of a coincidence. This product is totally pointless. It is supposed to cut drying time, smooth your hair, make it sleeker and straighten it. Umm, if you still have to use a straightening iron and your usual products, why bother to spend MORE on the Garnier and add yet another product?? Omgosh I am soo upset with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to follow up with a good conditioning treatment (Pureology brand) and I guess I will have to go for a trim now too to get the dry dead ends off. Have I mentioned how mad this product has me?! Ughhhhh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10/21/2010 -  It is now OVER A MONTH since using this product and my hair is still NOT back to normal. Despite using various deep conditioning treatments which were expensive and time consuming, I am still experiencing alot of breakage daily. My hair is still dry and the curl/waves have not yet come back to the way they were before using this product. Several nights I have shampooed and then applied conditioner and left it in my hair overnight and rinsed it in the morning. I believe that until my hair fully grows out, it is going to be in horrid condition. It is so upsetting. It took me YEARS to grow my hair this long and I have always received many compliments on it. Amazing how one product can ruin all that! I mean, this is my hair, a part of me, part of my identity. So very upsetting. This product needs pulled from the shelves. Even after getting my hair trimmed, it is only a matter of days until my ends are back in horrible shape again and that is not how my hair was previously. I  now have \\&quot;thin\\&quot; hair since it keeps breaking off and falling out every day. I am afraid one day I will end up bald. This is ridiculous. I&#x27;d love to know how they tested this product before placing it on the shelves and selling it to the public. How could they not know this would happen??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, please do not try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1/23/2011  So it is now January and my curls are back to normal FINALLY! My hair is still dry though. I have to keep using heavy conditioners, leave in conditioners and conditioning treatments. I still experience ALOT of breakage as well. I am happy that my curls did finally return to normal for the most part, but I am disappointed that my hair is still so darn dry. I guess I will have to keep getting it cut more often in order to get ALL the hair cut off that had the product on it. My new growth seems to be ok, but all else is drier than it has ever been. Ugh, one day it will be back to normal, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS POSTED ON THIS REVIEW - ALOT OF PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED GREAT ALTERNATIVES AND GREAT PRODUCTS THAT WORKED TO HELP REPAIR THEIR HAIR AFTER USING THE GARNIER BLOW DRY PERFECTOR.

    <li> I am only posting my review after reading all the negative reviews. I used this about a week ago and couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked just wished it was permament.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was in good shape to start with and is not colored. I did not notice a negative difference in the condition of my hair. My hair still feels silky smooth. If you read the instructions it clearly says do not use this if you relaxed or colored your hair less than 2 weeks ago &amp; do not color your hair within 2 weeks of using. My hair for once blowed out like a dream. So smooth and straight. I love it!!!! But the negative I did notice was the strong smell it does smell like a perm. And after washing out it lasts a day or two.</li>
    <li> I wish that I&#x27;d read these reviews before I bought this product.  It RUINED my hair...My first warning should have been the horrible chemical smell of the product.  But I soldiered on...and wound up with dry, brittle hair. Its been six months and my hair is just starting to recover. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> This product has ruined my hair.  I followed instuctions exactly as they were and my hair is completely dry and damaged now.  I called Garnier and they&#x27;re refunding the price I paid in product coupons and they recommended one of their conditioners.  They need to pull this product from store shelves.  I wish I had read all the reviews before buying.</li>
    <li> Wow - miracle product for me!!!  It did EVERYTHING it claimed, including dramatically reducing blow-out time.  I have to say, though that my hair is very thick, medium-coarse texture, wavy and generally unruly.  Drying and blowing out my hair (section by section) generally takes almost an hour, but was about 2/3 that with this product (yes my hair is thick).      However - I think Garnier really spent more time and money on marketing than on customer focus.  The box says that it is for the following hair types and shows straight/frizzy hair, wavy hair and curly hair.  Nothing at all about texture/volume.  The model on the front has thin-medium hair.  In contrast, my hair was about 5x her volume when blown out and still about 2-3 times as volumous when flat-ironed.    Bottom line - this is a GREAT product for women with very thick/coarse hair but should clearly be stated as such.  Now I will have to run out and stock up as I fear this product will fall flat due to mislabeling/mismarketing.</li>
    <li> Positives:&lt;br /&gt;allows hair to dry more quickly&lt;br /&gt;easier to blow dry straight&lt;br /&gt;easier to flat iron&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;causes hair breakage&lt;br /&gt;removes curl&lt;br /&gt;odor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened? I used the product as required and had good immediate results. My hair was much straighter when I blow dried it but it did require a flat iron for the look I was after. After the first washing I noticed some minor hair breakage around the crown and every hair-wash thereafter more breakage occurred. I have had very little hair breakage before and there was nothing new in my regime except this product. The hair breakage was middle of the road on the finer hairs near the crown and not on the thicker or more sturdy hair on the rest of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get many compliments on my hair while the product was active (about 3 weeks.) My hair stayed straighter longer and required minor touch ups from overnight sleeping rather than a full flat iron the next morning. The humidity affected my hair less but then again it was winter and much cooler outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did NOT like the way my hair looked unless it was straight. The curl was removed and the extremely small wave I was left with was very difficult to work out. Now that the product is gone completely my curl is coming back but slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not use this product again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at Walgreens for about $13.00.  I didn&#x27;t realize that I had to wait 2 weeks after having my hair colored to use this product, so it sat on my counter for a week or so.  I tried the product on the 14th day.  I have shoulder length, fine and frizzy hair.  No matter what I do, I can&#x27;t \\&quot;blow-out\\&quot; my hair like the do in the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first serum you have to apply smells pretty bad, but I wouldn&#x27;t let that affect my decision.... it is a chemial solution after all.  The second tube smelled GREAT!  It made up for the smelly first tube.  After rinsing and blow drying my hair was PIN straight.  I also flat ironed it to \\&quot;lock in\\&quot; the straightening effect.  I have never been able to get my hair that striaght myself before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has now been two and a half weeks, and my hair is just now getting frizzy again.  The product did seem to dry my hair out, but just at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely use this product agian!  I hope it hold up as well during the humid Louisiana heat as it does in the relatively dry air.</li>
    <li> Please do not use this product.  I never write reviews but I am hoping I will be able to save someone out there from having the unbelievably aweful experience I have had with this Garnier Fructis Blow Dry Perfector Kit.  It absolutely ruined my hair.  I had to have all of my hair cut off and it is still unmanageable.  I am 45 years old and have done many things to my hair over the years, but have never had an experience that  compares to this one. It will most likeley take a year or more for my hair to come back......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly hope this will help someone NOT to use this product!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> 0 stars! This is the worst smelling thing I have ever smelt and it gave me a headache. It smells like nair mixed with rotten eggs. The smell was left in my hair and in my room for 3 days. When I washed it out my hair felt heavy and stiff. After I blow dried it I noticed my hair was much shorter than before from breakage. My hair was stretchy when wet, and when dried it felt like cotton balls. It broke off more and more each day. I was too scared to wash it or put it up, so I made an appointment with my hair dresser. When I first called her, she asked what I used. When I told her it was the blow dry perfector, she already knew what it was. She said a lot of girls have came in with ruined hair after using this. She dyed my hair from blonde to very dark brown to hide the damage, I&#x27;m now on a treatment plan of deep conditioning every day, no heated styling tools, and a weekly cut. I wish I would have read reviews on this before I bought it...I used this about 2 months ago and since I did it, my hair has been cut 10 inches shorter, and one side is cut to the top. I plan on getting a wig until it grows back and is healthy. I wish this would be taken out off the shelves, I don&#x27;t want anyone to go through what I went through. PLEASE, do not buy this product unless you want to be in a wig too!</li>
    <li> BEWARE OF THIS PRODUCT.....I, like so many others on this list, destroyed my hair from root to tip by using this product.  It doesn&#x27;t just dry out the ends. It literally destroys your hair.  I had long, semi thick hair and now I have mid-length, straw like hair that it extremely thin and brittle.  It will take years for my hair to recover from using this product just once.  There seem to be a few positive reviews....all I can say is, \\&quot;just wait\\&quot;.....it takes time for this product to truly destroy your hair.  You&#x27;ll probably notice your hair getting dryer and thinner over the next few months.  I am very, very upset because of what this has done to my hair.....VERY UPSET![[ASIN:B003QUHWT8 Garnier Sleek &amp; Shine Blow Dry Perfector]]</li>
    <li> Just wanted to reiterate the previous reviews...  terrible product, completely destroyed my hair. It has been six months since I used this product and I am still contending with the damage it did, the \\&quot;chemical layers\\&quot; that were the result of using this product. My stylist will attest to the terrible damage it did. If there is a class action suit regarding this product, I want to be informed because at the very least, it needs to be pulled from the shelf.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Target a few weeks ago and tried it. I already have dry hair so I only used half of the serum and cream (making 2 applications from the box instead of the intended 1). My hair was still dry but it was much easier to straighten and about 90% less frizzy when air dried than prior to using the product.&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion is not to use the entire application, only half and see what results you get.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done Japanese hair straightening at salons for years. Every six months, for around $400. I have very tight curls, ringlets really. My hair texture is fine and it&#x27;s never been colored. I followed the process the way that my hairdresser does the straightening process at the salon, which is... I applied the product uniformly, in sections, starting at the places that have the tightest most resistant curls. For me that&#x27;s around the crown of my head. I applied just enough to coat the hair, which in the end meant I only used about 1/3 of the bottle for my hair length (which is below my shoulders). I combed it through and then waited 15minutes, because it took about five to get it on. Then I rinsed it VIGOROUSLY in the shower. Really let the water rinse it out for about 10 minutes all while shaking the hair at the roots. I could tell an improvement in texture right away. Then I put the second solution (probably used about 1/3 the tube. I blow-dried with a round boar bristle brush in sections and used a flat iron over each small piece to smooth. This is critical, because it&#x27;s this step that straightens the hair. This process is JUST LIKE the salon straightening treatments. The result was AS good as the $400 treatment. I think that the bad reviews are technique related. You cannot just put the product on your head, with more in some areas and less in others. You have to apply the same amount to each strand. This is an AWESOME option, if you take your time and want to save a ton of money. Yes, it&#x27;s stinky. Not nearly as bad as people make it out to be. I never would have bought it if I had read the reviews, but I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t. I feel lucky that a home option for heat-activated, thiol straightening has finally come out.</li>
    <li> I received this product from [..] and had put off using it after reading some of the reviews on it. When I poured the first bottle of product in my hand, I thought I would throw up from the stench--seriously--it smelled my entire home up! Even after rinsing it out my hair is awful smelling.&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to cause a lot of my hair to fall out or break off as well while I was rinsing it. Not sure why since I had JUST washed it. Applied second product as directed and blow dried. I didn&#x27;t notice any shortening in drying time whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Did it straighten my hair? Definitely. Will I buy this product again? I highly doubt it. The smell alone was more than enough to turn me off of any positive result that I received. If I desire to get a straightening treatment again I will go with the salon!&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and buy hair oils, serums, etc rather than this product...</li>
    <li> I want to say typically I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything without checking reviews- but when I saw this at my Target and I read that it had natural ingredients and that it wasn&#x27;t permanent, I just thought it was a new natural frizz product and threw it in my basket.  If I had read the reviews here...OMG-  I NEVER would have purchased it.  Not even a chance.      I twice now have gone through the professional Keratin Complex Smoothing  anti frizz treatment which is a bit costly but doesn&#x27;t straighten the hair -just makes it softer and takes away the frizz.  I live in Florida and have to say I planned on continuing to get the Keratin treatments every few months as I love that I can air dry my wavy hair-  without any frizz.  I&#x27;m one of those people that doesn&#x27;t always like my hair to be poker straight but if I wanted to straighten it took no time at all.  It was about time for me to have another treatment -that&#x27;s when I bought this stuff.     When I read how to use this product it seemed so much like the professional keratin smoothing version I followed what my hair dresser typically would do.  I knew to make sure while doing this process that my hair was 100 percent blow dried dry- and then used a flat iron to straighten everything.  You need to do this during this process even if most of the rest of the time you want to let your hair dry with a wave.  So that&#x27;s the way I dried my hair.      Nobody is kidding at all about the smell of this product.  The smell..my husband is still complaining about the smell of this product and that I made the entire house smell like \\&quot;sulfur\\&quot; and it&#x27;s been a few days..  I would suggest to use this product outside if at all possible!!!!  I would have lowered the amount of stars due to the smell -but honestly with the horrific reviews this product has here I gave it the extra pity points I would have taken off for wretched smell.    Here is a step by step of how I used it.  It was a huge amount of work and terrible smell -but it did what it said as far as no more frizz...    I shampooed with Lavera Shampoo (organic -also can be found at Target) dried my hair with a towel and then put the disgusting smelling cream on my head.  I covered my head with a plastic cap and waited the 20 minutes and washed it out per directions with no shampoo.  I also didn&#x27;t at this point add any conditioner as the directions said not to -dried my hair off and my hair felt strange --kind of dry.  I then added the blow dry cream.  I sat in front of the TV with my blow drier and it seemed had to blow dry my hair forever to get it dry one hundred percent.  The ends of my hair didn&#x27;t look super healthy at this point as many pointed out- and I did have a quick flash of panic...but when I get the professional treatments it never looked good at this stage either -this is when the flat iron comes in.  I made sure my hair was 100 percent flat ironed.  The ends still didn&#x27;t look silky enough to me- so I put the following on my hair on the ends.  A mixture of Avalon Organics Lavender conditioner,  few drops of Frizz ease and a drop of Fekkai glossing cream (the Avalon Organics is the only thing you can&#x27;t buy at Target)  I then smoothed that over the ends and my whole head looked smooth, shiny and poker straight.  Just like when I get my hair done at the salon -my husband who doesn&#x27;t typically notice things even pointed that out and if I didn&#x27;t stink up the house he would have thought I has just went to the salon to have this done.   Just like when I got the keritin complex smoothing treatment I didn&#x27;t wash or put any hair ties in my hair for the first 2 days -but I did smooth it each morning with the flat iron and if needed used the mix of creams for my ends.   It was at this point I came here to read how long this would last and was completely shocked by the horrible reviews!!!  I again never would have even tried it if I read these reviews.  I know fried hair and this did not fry my hair. But I wanted to wait until I washed it out prior tosubmitting my review -just to make sure.    To me the real test was when I washed it out on the third day which was yesterday.  Instead of blow drying it l - I let it air dry which I also read you can&#x27;t do -no issue here...and the real test.... then I brushed it.  Anyone with wavy hair knows the way to make frizz is to let your hair air dry and then brush it!!!  No frizz.  It just needed some smoothing on the ends (used same creams as I mention above plus I also used at times some Nexxus humectress).  Even though I brushed it when dry -my hair went into awesome smooth frizzless waves- looks super healthy.       This product does have the smoothing effects many of us want without hundreds of dollars to a salon.  It is a bit frightening to know however that I used this without checking to see and thank goodness it didn&#x27;t damage my hair!!!  Bottom line -outside of extreme smell and work - end result based on the smoothing aspect is 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s a good thing I did not read the reviews before I tried this product!  My hair is chemically colored, blonde, midlength and thin &amp; tends to break somewhat easily. (I am 55 years old).  I am on my third washing and my hair is soft, silky and straight WITHOUT using the flat iron. (I try to avoid heat on my hair as much as I can). We wash with (non-softened) well-water and usually my hair is dry and frizzy after washing! Now my hair feels thicker and reminds me of my 19 year old daughter&#x27;s hair after she returns from the salon.  However, I did NOT use the entire contents of the first tube (the directions did not say to use the entire tube) so I used just enough to saturate my hair (about 1/2).  It was smelly but not unbearable. The second tube seemed to \\&quot;neutralize\\&quot; the odor and then my hair smelled pretty good.     I would definately buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I tried this about a month ago. I hadn&#x27;t read any reviews, but it was recommended in a popular ladies mag as a alternative to the formaldehyde laced brazillian hair treatments. Here&#x27;s my experience:    My hair has a medium curl to it so frizz starts when my hair is only an inch long. I don&#x27;t dye my hair, wash it only 2-3 three times a week, and Aussie 3 Minute Miracle conditioner is a staple in my hair washing routine. My hair is complicated by the fact that it has many different hair types to it- there are coarse tightly curled hairs like black people hair, blond baby fine if-you-look-at-it-wrong-it-will-break hair and everything in between. For my hair to be completely straight I have to use a flat iron, period. I have a shorter cut so for the past few months I have had to flat iron it every time I wash it.    I used it after my morning shower following the instructions for application to the letter. I rinsed a minute or two earlier than the instructions said because the smell is absolutely nauseating (the unmistakable smell of sulfur, rotten eggs). I had to actually put a shower cap over my hair while waiting or I would have thrown up. Even if it had worked out perfectly I wouldn&#x27;t have used it again for this very reason. After rinsing I could still smell it on my hair and, while the conditioner/neutralizer provided helps, nothing gets that smell out but a lot of shampooing. After rinsing out the conditioner/neutralizer I started my normal styling process. Normally, since I have to use the flat iron regardless, I just blow dry my hair willynilly and let it be as big as it wants to be. With this I went all out and did the slow process of using a brush to blow it somewhat straight in small patches at a time. While I was flat ironing the vaopors that rose (there&#x27;s normally some vapor rise when I flat iron so that wasn&#x27;t worrisome)  smelled like rotten eggs which made me worry since that&#x27;s part of the issues with the brazzilian treatment (aside from formaldehyde being a carcinogen). This is when I really noticed the change in the condition of my hair.   It felt more coarse than usual, appeared very brittle, and certainlly wasn&#x27;t any more shiny (it was actually less shiny after this process). I started to panic at that point thinking that my hair would spend the next few weeks breaking off completely so I decided NOT to wash my hair for as long as I could possible stand. I don&#x27;t actually know anything about chemical hair processing, but I have heard that if you wash your hair too soon after some processes your hair will break off. I ended up waiting about 4 days to wash my hair again. I probably could have waited a little longer since my hair hadn&#x27;t built up much oil (which is saying a lot because my hair gets greasy quickly this time of year), but I couldn&#x27;t stand the rotten egg smell any longer. Thankfully, my hair didn&#x27;t break of after that wash or any of the washes since then. Today is the first time since I did it that a semblance of the pre-process shine has been back. The normal texture of my hair returned after the first wash and never has there been a time after using it that I didn&#x27;t have to flat iron my hair. My ends did get pretty brutalized, but because of the regular straightening I get monthly hair cuts anyway and I can&#x27;t say the flat iron didn&#x27;t contribute to the damage. One of the most distressing after effects was that about 24-36 hours after I used it, although there was never any burning, discomfort, or itching before or after the treatment, my entire scalp peeled off. It wasn&#x27;t dandruff. I have an ongoing battle with dandruff and these flakes were slightly smaller than a #2 pencil eraser, much too large for dandruff flakes, more like a peeling sunburn.     &lt;note: sulfur is used in processes like this to break the bonds in the building blocks of protein, this includes the ones found in your DNA&gt;    Bottom line if you feel like you have a professional hand at this type of thing you could give it a shot, but the smell alone is the biggest deterent. Unless you like your head to smell like rotten eggs for a week or two and a peeling scalp.</li>
    <li> I gave this a 1 star only because you have to give something, however, this product is a disaster in a bottle.  Both my daughter and I tried this product last night.  The smell is very strong and smells like rotten egg.  When you wet your hair to wash it, it re-activates the smell.  I&#x27;m not sure what Fructice was hoping to accomplish with this product.  It DOES NOT leave your hair sleek and shiney. It left our hair tangled, the ends frayed and sticking out, and our hair feeling very dry and rough. It did NOT cut down drying time nor frizz.  My daughter has fine curly hair and I have thick wavy hair. My and my daughters hair feels damamged after using this product.  We have appts tomorrow to trim our end to remove the damage from this product. I&#x27;m hoping the trim and a good hair mask will repair what has been done! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product today and I was very excited to try out. I have shoulder-length hair that is very thick and has tons of body. After using 1/2 of each bottle (i didnt need the full contents), I already saw a huge difference. The product made my hair a little less curly (i still have to straighten) but the amazing thing was that there was absolutely NO frizz at all!!!  ( &amp;&amp; my hair is much more shiny) Would definitely buy again!!</li>
    <li> I read in InStyle magazine and in Women&#x27;s Day that this product is \\&quot;the best and greatest\\&quot; product available to treat coarse, dry and finer hair. Supposedly it was going to make your hair sleek and pretty. Not so much. Not so much it all. I WISH I had Googled it before and read the posts below. :(   I have very curly hair that&#x27;s on the dry side. This product completely fried my hair, damaged it, burned my scalp and I reek of the smell of the 20-min Smooth it serum. It was the most horrible experience in my life and I have done salon relaxers, straighteners, at-home-kits, used many companies and I am very disappointed. At least it was only $10! This product is a two-step system, where after you shampoo and towel-dry your hair, you put the 20-min serum all over your hair (with gloves!) and then wait for 20 mins for it to soak in. Then rinse and put in the cream. After which, you blow dry. When I was rinsing off the serum, my hair felt heavy, thick and all in one glob, so I thought maybe something worked. After I towel-dried my hair, it was lifeless, sticky and even noticed one strand was slightly a different color (lighter). I don&#x27;t have highlights or colored hair, either (and have never done either). I thought the \\&quot;perfect it\\&quot; cream (step 2) would work. It smelled MUCH better than the serum, but it did absolutely nothing. When I blow dried my hair it wouldn&#x27;t dry at all. It&#x27;s been 10 hours and it&#x27;s still wet! My hair has more frizz in it now than I ever have had.   The worst part of the whole thing was that my scalp was completely burnt. I reeked of the pungent serum smell and itched all over my scalp and my shoulders. I had to take another shower and re-wash my hair and super conditioned it with my normal conditioner. My hair is not any better but at least I don&#x27;t stink and my head doesn&#x27;t itch as much.   I would wish this product on my worst enemy. Don&#x27;t recommend it at all. :(</li>
    <li> I unfortunately tried this product and it ruined my hair.  I had also purchased the Organix Brazilian Keratin hair straightener but used the Garnier first because it seemed like a quicker simpler task and thought if I didn&#x27;t like it, well it would at least wash out in 7 washes.  It does NOT WASH OUT.  I threw out the box and don&#x27;t know what harsh ingredients are in it but it fried my hair.  I look as if I am some white trash woman who has over processed her hair to be white blonde so it looks cheap, dry, thin, just plain nasty.    I have to cut at least 3 inches off now as the ends are permanently stuck on this frizz condition.  No amount of straightening, professional conditioning, curling, blow-drying, or humidity level will change the state.  It just has to be cut off.    I researched the active ingredient in Step 1 CYSTEINE and this is what I found-  Applications     Cysteine, mainly the L-enantiomer, is a precursor in the food, pharmaceutical, and personal care industries.      In the field of personal care, cysteine is used for permanent wave applications predominantly in Asia. Again the cysteine is used for breaking up the disulfide bonds in the hair&#x27;s keratin.  BREAKS UP HAIR&#x27;S KERATIN!  Please spread the word, text your friends.  Put this on Facebook.  Don&#x27;t let anyone use this if you care about them.  You might as well just put NAIR ON YOUR HEAD as you will get the same result and it is a little cheaper!</li>
    <li> I already posted a review but had to come back to share more bad news about it.  I tried to wash this product off and my hair was still in horrible shape.  I bought an expensive conditioner and still no help, after crying and not going to work I made the drastic decision of cutting it all off so I can restart with a healthy head of hair.  I feel like suing the manufacturer of this company.  This product needs to be taken off the shelves.</li>
    <li> I found this product to do exactly what it says and was gentle on my hair. My hair is thick and wavy and I live in Florida. My hair looks SOO much better with 1/2 the effort. I dont agree with the other reviews. It did smell bad but i used 1/2 the serum and then 1/2 the blowdry cream. It wasnt a big deal. The results were silky hair with less density. My hair was a little dry by shampoo 7, but that could have been for other reasons too. A deep conditioner and air dry restored my hair.  Try it its great!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, I have thick dry hair and it worked like a charm. I had no issues with drying out my hair and it may or may not hav shortened my styling time but the result was much nicer.</li>
    <li> Words cannot describe how terrible this product is. I have never written a review before, but this is a special situation. I have (or should I say HAD) long, healthy, non color treated hair. I bought this because my hair is kinda wavy... the kind that makes it look beach-messy, but I wanted to be straight and sleek for a change. I followed the directions EXACTLY. When I began to blow dry &amp; comb my hair, I realized that pieces had drawn up into these kinky, brittle, frizzy pieces. OH MY GOSH!!! Well, long story short this crap totally fried my hair. It feels awful and looks like a dry mess. I am terrified on what the longer results will be. I had to cut bangs to even make it presentable!!! Oh my I wish I had read the reviews beforehand. It is hard to believe a smoothing product could wreck one&#x27;s hair so badly.</li>
    <li> I have color-treated hair. Two weeks ago I used this product, using it more than 14 days after color as the instructions indicated. I applied the straightener for 20 minutes, rinsed, applied the sealer, and did not rinse or use styling products after sealer/before blow drying - all exactly as instructed. It took about 25 minutes to dry my hair during the treatment to activate the straightener. I used a large barrel curling iron to set the straightening with soft, natural looking ends; I did not use a flat iron because I do not want a stick-straight style. There is a smell to the straightener that hangs around for a day or so, but it&#x27;s not strong and is to be expected since this is essentially a semi-perm - instead of using curlers for permanent wave, we let the hair straighten, but the process is pretty similar.  I love the result. My hair was not dry before and is not dry after this treatment. The result lasted longer than 7 shampoos, even after another color treatment. I use the Garnier Sleek &amp; Shine shampoo and conditioner, apply L&#x27;anza Trauma Treatment to the ends to protect them as I&#x27;ve done for years, and use Sleek &amp; Shine styling serum with argan oil, which I&#x27;ve been using for several months. My daily blow drying was shortened by at least 5 minutes, down from 15, and my hair style looks great. The result is nice, sophisticated-looking straight hair that holds a very soft style with no frizz and my bangs laying exactly as I like them to look. I choose not to style it stick-straight, so I use only a blow dryer.  I don&#x27;t agree at all with any of the negative comments. I am very impressed with this product and will probably use it again.</li>
    <li> I did not read the reviews before I used this product, or I wouldn&#x27;t have tried it.  Fortunately this product seems to have worked for me.  I did it today, and I have not washed it yet, so I am not sure how it will hold up.  For now though, it is very straight and frizz free.   I took me a full hour to complete the process.  It seems like a lot of work for it to only last 7 washes.  First I washed my hair and did not condition.  Then I applied the serum.  It smells like rotten eggs.  I combed it through and left it in for 25 minutes.  I believe the serum opens the hair folicles (not sure of the technical terminology) so that the hair will absorb the cream.  This process does make the hair extremely course and nearly impossible to comb. My hair has a slight wave.  I can see how if someone has very curly hair how it would be very damaging to attempt to comb through it at this point.  I could hear hairs popping as they broke, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it was too bad.  It did make me nervous though. Once I applied the cream, it was much easier to comb.   My hair has highlights and low lights.  I read in a review for a similar product that if you have your flat iron too hot it will make highlights brassy.  It said to keep it under 400 degrees.  I had mine set at about 380, and my color is fine. Also, the creme seems to neutralize or cover up the rotten egg smell.  Thank goodness!  I am not sure that I would do this again.  Especially after reading the other reviews.  I feel like maybe I got lucky this time.  Also, like I said before, it is a lot of work.  There are other products that follow the same steps but claim to last longer.    I can get the same results using over the counter products.  They wash out everytime I shampoo though, so I have to start all over.  I am hoping that this product stays in so that it will shorten style time.  I will update if something drastic happens to my hair, but for now, so far so good.</li>
    <li> I bought this at my local Walgreens without reading the reviews first.  I used it and my hair hasn&#x27;t felt this soft since I was 8 years old.  JEEZZZ I can&#x27;t belive all the awful reviews!  I have hair to my shoulders that is extremely coarse and brittle due to constant color treatments.  Also I&#x27;m part Native American and mostly Caucasion so I suppose my hair&#x27;s texture could be a little bit different than most caucasion women.  My advice is to not use this product unless you have thick damaged hair, since that&#x27;s what its meant for and says so on the box.  Some of the one star reviews came from people who said they&#x27;re hair was perfect beforehand and damaged afterwards.  Also some of them said that they have thin hair.  Only use this if your hair is thicker in body or coarser.   The other trick is that you have to blow-dry it for a loooooooooong time.  When you think you&#x27;re done blow drying...keep going.  Most women only blow-dry their hair until is is reasonably dry.  With this product you have to blow-dry it about twice as long as you normally would.  Then flat iron it until it is perfectly straight.   I put the serum on for thirty minutes (as directed if you have stubborn hair) and followed the rest of the directions to the tee.  IT REALLY REALLY WORKS to soften your hair and make it way more manageable but it takes a lot of work (still easier than coloring your hair though).  For people who should be using this product, it works fantastically.  I worked at a salon for a while and nothing is this cheap and effective.   As most people mentioned, the serum does smell.  I wouldn&#x27;t do this before company was going to come over because it did linger in my house for a few hours.  But it&#x27;s really not unbearable, just unpleasant.  Also nothing in this kit stains which is great for clumsy people like me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m thankful for all the reviews here because I got this close to buying this and ruining my hair. I saw the Nexxus shampoo &amp; conditioner at a drugstore the other day and it looked good, so I tried it. WOW. Seriously. WOW. Frizz: gone for 4 days (and I washed because it was getting dirty, not to get rid of returning frizz). Hair is super soft, bouncy and shiny again. Get the Nexxus instead, totally worth the $$!</li>
    <li> First of all, there really needs to be some kind of warning on the OUTSIDE of the box about the absolutely FOUL odor that this stuff has. It smells like rotten eggs, mixed with burnt feathers and hot glue, and that stench stays in your hair after shampooing.   Second, this stuff doesn&#x27;t even work. I followed the directions EXACTLY, and even left the solution in for 30 minutes instead of 20. I blow dried my hair after the entire process was finished, and my hair came out dry, fluffy, wavy, and of course, smelly.  I&#x27;m extremely disappointed. I bought this kit because I have a 3 week old baby and am struggling to find time to style my very curly hair every morning. I knew that this would not make my hair perfectly straight, but I hoped that it would at least cut my flat ironing time in half, and it hasn&#x27;t. This is not the first time that I&#x27;ve been disappointed with the Garnier Fructis brand, and I think I&#x27;ll stay away from it for good.</li>
    <li> I had the worst experience.    My hair WAS in perfect condition.  This product caused so much damage I don&#x27;t even know where to start.  Just during the shampoo phase my hair was falling out in chunks ~ I really didn&#x27;t think I was going to have any hair left.  And during the blow out phase their was SOOO much breakage.  My pants were covered in my hair and my brush was packed full of my hair that fell out.  This product is not safe.  Do not use it.  It will ruin your hair.</li>
    <li> I finally have hair I can run my fingers through! My hair is shiny, it&#x27;s soft, and it&#x27;s beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I can see how this may not work for some people. Though I think it&#x27;s not as bad as everyone is saying. If you have fine hair, DON&#x27;T use this product. It says this on the box. Don&#x27;t use a product not designed for you and expect it to work. Use your heads, people.&lt;br /&gt;I admit, I shampooed and conditioned before using step 1, and I think this contributed to my wonderful results. Step 1 smells, which was my only con. The rest are all pros!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with troublesome THICK hair.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> I think the problem is Garnier has advertised this as being safe, non relaxer, non formaldehyde, etc.; however, there are real chemicals in this stuff.   The problem with using chemicals is if a person doesn&#x27;t take care of their hair during/after chemical treatment, it will feel like straw, and that person will lose their hair. By take care of it, I mean step up the conditioners: maybe a deep conditioner, maybe a leave in conditioner, maybe a bit of keratin protein, etc. It&#x27;s best to continue the extra conditioning for a while after the chemical treatment, and not just on the day of.  The Garnier works, and it lasts, but the only thing is, in all my years of hair straightening, and even relaxers experiments, I have never come across anything that smelled as bad as this stuff.   When I read the instructions, I knew they would dry my hair out; I knew it was bogus, so here&#x27;s how I did it without drying my hair out.  1. Put on dry unwashed hair for 20 minutes  2. rinse out  3. deep conditioner in the shower  4. rinse out  5. leave in conditioner  6. put on the perfect it serum and let it air dry  7. flat iron  I have a combination of dry and fine hair, and it easily breaks off. That&#x27;s why I use the conditioners, but if someone has oily hair, they may want to skip the leave in conditioner. Also, if someone&#x27;s hair is pretty responsive to hair dryers, then they may just do that, too. My hair takes a little work, being that I&#x27;m of sicilian descent, and my curls are stubborn, so I just go straight for the flat iron.  When I was done, I looked like a hair model. The effect lasted nearly two weeks (with a regimen of dry wash one day, wet wash the next). The size of these are enough to last, maybe, 6 more treatments. My hair middle of my shoulder blades, so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this stuff. Well, I guess how much a person needs to use depends on the texture, but mine didn&#x27;t need that much.  Also, when I woke up the next morning, my curls were in a lovely light curl orwave. It was impressive. The stuff works, it&#x27;s just Garnier didn&#x27;t market it properly, and they have to do something about the smell. It doesn&#x27;t go away easy; it smells just the stink bombs I got for Halloween, which is like someone leaked an SBD, a sulfuric singe your nose hairs fart on your head.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say it has ruined my hair at all, but the overall effect is not worth the horrendous smell. I notice the smell mostly when I am sleeping (yes, it&#x27;s strong enough to wake me up) and I might try a few extra shampoos today just to get the stupid smell out. It made my hair a tiny bit shinier, blowdrying was about as fast as usual. Overall, not much good to say about this. I&#x27;d try some other less stinky products if I were you.</li>
    <li> First of all, upon opening the package there is a warning that says, if you have ever blow-dried, used a flat iron, colored/highlighted your hair or have damage such as split-ends to not use this product. So basically 90% of the female population should steer clear of this based on THEIR own warning label!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have frizzy/wavy thick hair and I was excited to find a product to help cut down my 1 hour hair routine! BIG MISTAKE!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 4 days &amp; I have washed my hair twice now and my hair STILL smells like rotten-eggs! One time I had just finished up in the shower, when my 6 year old daughter came into the bathroom. Her first reaction was, \\&quot;ewwww mommy, what&#x27;s that smell!? It stinks!\\&quot;. Great!, I thought I just finished cleaning myself and I stink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is even worse when your hair is wet! I was in the mall the other day running errands, it was awful hot in the mall and I started sweating a little bit behind my neck where my hair was...my hair got a little bit wet because of sweating and released a monsterous smell of rotting eggs. How embarressed I was when I was talking to the sales clerk and I knew I was reeking of rotten eggs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only left the product on for about 18 minutes because the smell was so bad, I couldn&#x27;t tak it anymore. The product doesn&#x27;t cut down on dry time, I still have to dry and then use a flat iron on my hair. The texture of my hair seems a bit dryer than normal, but no visible damage, just the rotting egg smell, which makes my sick &amp; gives me a headache!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only positive I see is that my hair seems to stay straight until I shampoo my hair next, before using this my hair would always be a bit wavy by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, my opionion is....DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT....it&#x27;s horrible! I can&#x27;t believe they are selling this nasty, horrible, stinky stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It&#x27;s been about 6-weeks since my original review. The smell is finally gone. It took about 3 full weeks before the smell went away. But my hair did get pretty damaged. It is dry and brittle. The damage done to my hair was so not worth this horrible product! DO NOT BUY!ll went away. But my hair did get pretty damaged. It is dry and brittle. The damage done to my hair was so not worth this horrible product! DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> I was in the middle of step 1 (which does have a horrible, rancid smell) when I thought I&#x27;d check product reviews online.  After reading the terrible reviews I ran to the bathroom and immediately washed out rotten egg serum using two shampoos and then 20 minutes of conditioner.  I only had it in for maybe 12 minutes but my hair still ended up dull, dry, and my Natural Instincts temp color for grays is gone.  Curly hair is hard enough to manage and it&#x27;s terrible that so many people put their faith and money in this product only to have their hair RUINED.  Garnier should take this off the market immediately and offer refunds!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use over the Christmas break because I knew it would be humid, and snowing, and we&#x27;d be staying inside a lot and the air would be very dry, and my hair would be super frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I bought the kit, washed my hair (did not use conditioner), towel dried it, ran a big comb through it to get out all the tangles, and did Step 1.  The people complaining about the smell are exaggerating.  I&#x27;ve used self-tanners that smelled worse.  It is nowhere near the smell of my hair color. Anyway, I used just enough product in Step 1 to lightly coat all of my hair.  My hair is one length and falls to the middle of my back.  It is fine, but thick and I used roughly 1/2 of the bottle. Then I came out of the bathroom to surf the web for 20 minutes.  I got here and read all the negative reviews and was scared to death.  All I could think was \\&quot;what if my hair falls out, what if it strips my color, what if I have a big greasy mess?\\&quot;  I&#x27;d already began the process, so when my 20 minutes was up I went into the shower and thoroughly rinsed my hair with warm water.  I towel dried it and to my delight, my hair was not falling out and my color did not wash out.  My hair did feel \\&quot;too clean\\&quot; though.  Like when you wash with a clarifying shampoo and forget to use conditioner.  So then I moved on to Step 2. Again, combed the tangles out of my hair and only used enough product to lightly coat my hair.  I would use an amount of the creme similar to the amount of lotion you&#x27;d use on your hands, and I did this about 5 times.  I have a little more than 1/2 of that bottle left, also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, I blow dried my hair.  It was super soft and super straight.  No excess breakage, no greasy mess, and no color loss with gray hair showing.  I then flat ironed it and applied a dab of Frizz-Ease and took off.  I&#x27;m on day 3 now and I can tell you the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. My hair is still straight, soft, and frizz-free&lt;br /&gt;2. My hair is sort of shiny and not greasy&lt;br /&gt;3.

I color my hair every other month with the Clairol Nice N&#x27; Easy hair color (I get Perfect 10 if it&#x27;s on sale).  My hair is fine, but there is a lot of it.

    <li> I received a free sample of this from Allure and didn&#x27;t end up trying it until last night.  I followed the directions to a T.  I washed my hair with shampoo and no conditioner.  I then put on the serum for 20 minutes.  Other reviews are NOT joking about the smell.  It is AWFUL.  So terrible.  My roommate thought something died.  I had to apply the serum in the hallway with the window open so I wouldn&#x27;t gag.  I accidentally got a little bit on my scalp and it burned and stung - not good.  But I kept it on for all 20 minutes.  This is when I decided it would be a good time to go online and check out the reviews.  I was terrified, but figured I already had it on for 10 minutes, might as well do the rest and give it my own try (and I&#x27;m glad I did).    I rinsed out all of the serum and like another poster said, my hair felt \\&quot;too clean\\&quot;, like you used shampoo without conditioner and it stripped the hair.  My hair still smelled awful, like the serum.  I then put the protector cream on it that actually smelled pretty good.  I put a ton of it on and then blow dried my hair.  That part took forever.  You think you&#x27;re kind of done, but no, not really.  The protector cream leaves a film on your hair that makes it feel heavy.  After blow drying, I used a flat iron.     Results: it looks like I just got a blowout, really!  I have really thick long hair and it&#x27;s always kind of \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; after I blow dry it... Not this time!  It looks great!  I&#x27;m glad I tried this out on my own without reading the reviews first!    However, I&#x27;m not sure I would buy it because of the awful serum smell and the amount of chemicals - stinging and burning my scalp?  No thanks.  Woke up this morning and my hair still smelled terrible.  It&#x27;s not as bad as last night and you can&#x27;t really smell it unless you actually put your hair in your face, but bleh.</li>
    <li> Seriously, Who came with such a stupid Idea? Please Read Ms. MYPENNAME review she explains with details what exactly whappened to her, same thing happened to me... It&#x27;s been 4 Almost 5 months and my hair still such a mess... Plese make yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy this product!... WE SHOULD LAWSUIT THIS COMPANY...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review because this product has so many bad reviews that I feel like I need to stand up for it! I absolutely loved this product. I have naturally wavy/frizzy hair that is really difficult to straighten, and even once it&#x27;s straight, it will revert to wavy and frizzy at the slightest provocation. I used this product before spending a week in Florida, and my hair was so easy to manage I was shocked. I blew it dry multiple days in a row, and it stayed mostly straight even after sleeping with it in a bun. I actually got complimented a few times on how not frizzy my hair was, especially in the Florida humidity.     I do agree with the other reviewers that it stinks, I had to open all my windows while it was in my hair, but that seems to be a small price to pay for straight, shiny, manageable, not frizzy hair. It felt like hay while I was washing out the first step, but I put the second step in and blew it dry, and it was soft and silky as ever. Every time I washed it again I noticed the smell, it was as if the water reactivated it, but as soon as I put a nice smelling shampoo in my hair, the smell was gone again.    For the price and the time, this is an amazing product. Maybe it reacts differently with different people&#x27;s hair, but I&#x27;ve already bought three more boxes and intend to use it again.    And, for the record, I colored my hair two days before I used it the first time, and it didn&#x27;t affect the color at all.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read the previous reviews befrore trying this stupid wothless products that absolutely ruin not only my long hair that took me years to grow but, the curls that I naturally had never came back. MY HAIR BREAKS OFF EVERYDAY! DO NOT TRY THIS PRODUCT! STATY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT! IT&#x27;S GARBAGE!!!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I did not see the other reviews here until after I purchased this product at the drugstore and used it. I only found these reviews after complaining to a friend who told me about them. Some of you have said it&#x27;s only bad for fine or damaged hair, but that&#x27;s definitely not true. I have THICK, COARSE hair that&#x27;s normally very healthy and shiny. It just gets frizzy in the humidity of summer, so I decided to try this product. I thought it was some kind of conditioning treatment. That&#x27;s how it&#x27;s presented in its packaging. NOWHERE on the package does it say this is a perm or any kind of chemical treatment. In fact, it says, \\&quot;This is a non-permanent styling aid. It is not a relaxer or straightener.\\&quot; They say it&#x27;s \\&quot;formulated with a protein building block found naturally in hair.\\&quot; Well, that&#x27;s baloney. It is not a \\&quot;styling aid,\\&quot; or a \\&quot;blow-dry perfector,\\&quot; or a \\&quot;smoothing kit,\\&quot; or any kind of conditioning treatment. It is a hair ruiner. My once beautiful hair is TOTALLY RUINED. It feels like straw, it&#x27;s not smooth, and it&#x27;s NOT SHINY. It&#x27;s now got this horrendous dull, dried-out look to it, like it was stripped of its outer coating or something. I will be talking to a lawyer to find out what I can do. If anything comes of that, I&#x27;ll come back with an update. Whatever the outcome, this company is on my schitt list, and will be publicly, FOREVER. I will be VERY VOCAL.</li>
    <li> This product does the opposite of what it promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed instructions perfectly and now my hair is drier and more damaged that ever imaginable. It has been months and even with twice-weekly deep conditioning treatments and trims, my hair still breaks off at an incredible rate. On top of all this, it now takes LONGER to style my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy this product!</li>
    <li> The company definately gives false advertising.  The problem is the misleading ideas and words on the box.  If your hair is color treated, it will destroy your hair! It is not fine for color treated hair like the box says and your hair will be like a rubber band.  Used this product thinking ohh I will have nice straight hair on July 4th 2011.  Still on Jan 15, 2012 my hair is a complete mess!  Damaged, broken, falling out, no shine and terrible. What misleading advertising, its junk and im still mad as hell. They dont care when you call, they lie, and they wont take any responsibility.  Basically your screwed. Dont be fooled this is a strong chemical.  This is no basic little styling gel blow dry treatment.  DONT USE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It now August almost September 2012 so over one year since I used this crap and damage is still there!!  Yes I have new growth however I had very long hard and you can see clearly where the old damage is and the nice new growth.  Its going to be another 2 more years until all damage is finished so three years of my life with crappy terrible hair unless I cut it super short and I refuse.  Thanks for all the trouble you terrible people and corp!  SCREW YOU!</li>
    <li> I hope NO ONE uses this product!  I followed the instructions to a TEE and I ended up with extremely dry hair that is SEVERELY damaged!  During the 2nd step, my hair started coming out in CHUNKS!  I ended up going in a shower and shampooing it out (so I didnt finish the 2nd step) and I had to immediately go to my salon and get an expensive protein treatment done on my hair and I bought Redken Extreme Anti-Snap that I use daily now.  My hair looks awful and feels awful.  I am going to try using Chaz Dean WEN shampoo this week to see if it helps, but I am extremely upset that this happened. I contacted Garnier, and it took a week for them to get back to me, but they said if I send them the receipts for all my expenses, they would reimburse me.  Also, I have to send them before/ after pics.  The lady on the phone acted so surprised that this happened, yet on their menu of their phone tree, it says \\&quot; If you are calling about our 2 step Blow Out serum, press 2\\&quot;  Gee, really???? You&#x27;ve had SOOO many complaints that your product needs it&#x27;s own button on your phone tree?  Something is terribly wrong at this company that they haven&#x27;t pulled it from the shelves yet.  I am asaking EVERYONE who reads this to boycott ALL Garnier products.  They obviously don&#x27;t test their products well, or if they do, they they just lie about the results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 49 years old and, previous to using this product, I had shiny but naturally wavy shoulder-length hair. I NOW know that this product isn&#x27;t to be used on highlighted hair, even if it&#x27;s in EXCELLENT condition. It&#x27;s MY fault that I didn&#x27;t completely read the instructions and I can only say that when I saw that it was a product that only lasted up to seven shampoos, I assumed (wrongly) that it wouldn&#x27;t do anything permanent to my hair. It said it was okay for colored hair and I failed to consider that&#x27;s different than highlighted hair.    Long story short, it absolutely FRIED my hair. It&#x27;s now like a blonde, trashy broken mess of hair. I conditioned and reconditioned and conditioned again and it is simply breaking off by the handfuls when I try to blow dry it. I will try tomorow to let it air dry to see if that&#x27;s any better, but I doubt it. I seriously think that I&#x27;ll have to go get my hair cut short this week and that almost makes me cry because I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out for years.    Words can&#x27;t describe what this product did to my hair, but trust me when I say that if you saw my hair now, you wouldn&#x27;t use it if they paid you $1,000. Save yourself the misery and grief caused by this terrible product and don&#x27;t use it!!! And spare your friends the destruction of their hair and tell them to NOT use this product!!</li>
    <li> I tried this product about two weeks ago. I wanted to give it time to see how it really affected my hair before I posted a review. I have, in the past, used over the counter straighteners on my curly hair, so I&#x27;m somewhat familiar with the whole routine. However, it has been about 2 years since I last used one. My hair has been recently cut and conditioned, so it was in really good condition and not chemically processed at all before I tried this product. I wash my hair every other to every 3rd day because it&#x27;s naturally very dry.    I did not experience any of the nightmarish problems other people have with it ruining their hair. My hair is a tiny bit softer and straighter than it was before (they say it isn&#x27;t a straightener, but it smells like one, and my hair did absolutely lost some of it&#x27;s curl). The smell is AWFUL, and my husband just commented yesterday that he can still smell it in my hair. It might take slightly less time to straighten my hair, but it&#x27;s not enough to make this a worthwhile product.     Based on what I&#x27;ve read, this product worked exactly the way it was supposed to on my hair. And that being the case, the impact on my hair was not worth the smell, the risk it would destroy my hair, that I&#x27;d have an allergic reaction on my scalp, or the ten bucks I spent.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use it!!!  It dried my hair beyond repair, I don&#x27;t know what to do now to get it back, keep trying all kinds of conditioning treatment. Its been 2 months now and its still bad. Even when I straighten the hair it looks like straw.   I wish I read the reviews before.  To clarify: I never used a relaxer in my hair, just have colored hair and the damage that comes from that. I am white, with medium thickness hair and shoulder length. The hair has awful texture and it lost the waves.</li>
    <li> I bought this a year ago when it was new. I heat style my hair often, and this is made to look like a really nice conditioning treatment. IT IS NOT! I followed the instructions, and left it on for the required amount of time. During the process, my mom commented how much it smelled like perm fluid. The instructions said that some odor was normal, so I trudged on. BIG MISTAKE. When I rinsed, it looked as though I had treated my hair with NAIR - it was completely destroyed - shriveled up, frizzy and burnt. I had only gotten it cut a few days before, and it was healthy before I did the treatment. The box says it&#x27;s safe for color treated hair - it&#x27;s not safe for anyone&#x27;s! I had to cut it then and twice since, up to my chin, but I think that FINALLY after a year, I am free of the damage this product did to my hair. DON&#x27;T RISK IT!!</li>
    <li> I thought I would join the choir with my opinion on this product. I too fell victim to the deceptive advertising and marketing lure in hopes to tame my frizz. Yes, the first step of the process was torturous with the same smell as a bad perm. Now I know that this is the same ingredient used in perms and relaxers!!! I am pretty sure I read something about it being made out of a all natural rice product when I was sitting there with something that smelled like sulfur on my head wondering if I just ****** up.. Really Garnier??? Why not call it a relaxer IF that is what it is. Oh yeah that&#x27;s right....since the Brazilian Blow Drys are popular and expensive you are trying to capitalize on this craze to make LOTS of profit. Never mind that you are actually victimizing millions of women as evident of the reviews all over the web.    So I noticed that my hair was not it&#x27;s normal texture after the treatment. I chalked it up to a crappy product that I wouldn&#x27;t try again. My hair was difficult to manage BUT over time I started noticing that my right side of my head was a lot thinner then the left. My hair would shed more normal and I went to the doctor thinking that my thyroid was out of wack. My blood tests and hormone tests came back normal. I was so freaked out that I bought the Men&#x27;s strength rogaine foam. Then I remembered that I used Sleek and Shine blow dry and started looking at the reviews online. Call me stupid but as harsh as Sleek and Shine was on my hair at the time...I didn&#x27;t think an over the counter product could cause this much damage over time. The good news is that at least I know I don&#x27;t have a life threatening disease that is causing my hair to FALL OUT! The bad news is this product ruined my hair causing it to break off and fall out over time (it&#x27;s now 3 months post)The right side of my head has lost more than 50% of its volume and the left side about 20%.    I read that Morroccon Restorative Mask helps and I went down to Sally&#x27;s yesterday and used it lastnight and this morning. The brand is Argan. It does help tremendously!! This morning is the very first day in 3 months I did not have a hand full of hair after combing it with a wide tooth comb. I also use Paul Mitchel super skinny smoothing serum to improve the texture and make it more manageable to style.    I went on ripoffreport.com and was surprised that no one has complained there. At least when I searched Garnier....there was nothing. I am going to do this today!! I have experienced in the past that this is a great way to get a company&#x27;s attention because the search results are so good on this web site it will pop up anytime you post a complaint. If you have had a bad experience with \\&quot;Sleek and Shine Blow Dry Perfector Kit\\&quot; (BS name) please, please make a complaint on ripoffreport.com . This toxic product with the pretty packaging needs to be pulled off the market!    and beware of the positive reports....either they work for Garnier, have something to do with the patent, OR have not YET experienced noticeable hair loss  but the will over time. If it&#x27;s the latter....they will be back to eat their words.     -Hairless in Ventura</li>
    <li> ZERO STARS.   Please, for the love of God, do not buy this product. After using the product in March of 2011 and having my hair fall out of my head in clumps as a result, I read the reviews on Amazon and just cried. My hair is just as everyone else has said: dry, brittle, and falling out. I was unable to run my fingers through my hair and blow drying only made my hair fall out more. I got a protein treatment the following weak which did not help - the next day I had to just go to my hair stylist to chop off my hair. She chopped off as much as she could, but my hair is damaged all the way to the roots. I also have not been able to color my hair ever since due to the existing damage this product caused (dying my hair will only make it more damaged), so not only have I had a horrible, short haircut for the past 7 months, I also have two-toned hair and am not able to fix either. I am no longer able to blow dry, flat iron, or curl my hair. I am disappointed that this product remains on the shelves and I feel so bad for the women who buy this product as I did without reading these reviews. Please, please do not take a chance with this product and think that what happened to me and the rest of these reviewers won&#x27;t happen to you - it will. Worse product ever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done this twice now and my hair has never been so easy to manage. I&#x27;m a black woman with naturally kinky hair with no color and no previous relaxer who just needed a change. I had very healthy hair going in. I saw the commercial and then did some research online and decided to give it a try since I didn&#x27;t think it would be very strong since the target market was white women&#x27;s hair. I don&#x27;t like really strong relaxers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions to the tee and have what I describe as hair that is straight, not straightened. If you&#x27;re black, you know what I mean. When we straighten our hair with a hot comb or flat iron, it tends to be stiff and sticking out and not very touchable. After using this product, my hair was truly straight and feels very silky. I can&#x27;t stop touching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news is that I did definitely have some breakage. I know it was from making my flat iron too hot. Before using this I would just flat iron my hair if I wanted it straight, and it needed to be much hotter, around 410-430. After this treatment, I did need to turn down the heat to around 390 and the breakage stopped. I also use a spray protectant before blow drying or flat ironing that is designed to protect hair from the heat. I think that has helped also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also stinks very badly until a few washes, but I find that a small price to pay for such manageable hair.  I&#x27;ll go back to my afro some day but it&#x27;s been fun playing with my hair for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the other reviews I would say do a test swatch before putting this all over your hair. It obviously doesn&#x27;t work as well for everyone as it did for me. I love it.</li>
    <li> I tried tried this because I flat iron all they time and have not quite gotten the hang of doing a good blow blow out so I thought this would help with that.  My hair is very curly and thick.  I haven&#x27;t had it cut in a long time so it is damaged and I color it.  It says it is safe for color treated hair but as soon as I noticed that it smelled like a perm I figured it would strip my color.  I used a reverse perm (also \\&quot;safe for colored hair\\&quot; many years ago which took out a lot of my color.  Sure enough, I saw the color come out when I rinsed and I don&#x27;t mean a little tint in the water, I mean a decent amount of color.  I still have enough color in my hair so it doesn&#x27;t look bad but it is noticeable that it&#x27;s faded some.  Besides that I didn&#x27;t see any difference when I blow dried my hair.  Keep in mind that I do not have a nozzle so that may be due to my equipment and technique rather than the product.  I did not see any extra damage or anything like that so it didn&#x27;t make my hair worse, I just didn&#x27;t see any improvement. My main issue is that if you want to keep your color, don&#x27;t bother. I red other reviews on here in which the ladies say it stropped their color and I am definitely backing them up on that one.</li>
    <li> Like most everyone else here who has used this product, end results are disaster! A month after using this product my hair is still very dry and frizzier than it was prior to me using it. I have large clumps of hair falling out everytime I brush my hair or shower.  DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> This Garnier Fructis Blow Dry Perfector System didn&#x27;t work at all.  I thought it was just my type of hair, but now I know different.  I wish I had read these reviews before I used this product.  This didn&#x27;t even hold for one day.  I worked out in the evening after using this kit and following the steps exactly.  My hair felt sticky, stiff and dry.  I managed to use a flat iron to straighten it, but my hair really wasn&#x27;t happy at all. I worked out in the evening, producing the same frizzy hair I always get.  So, I saw no benefit to this product at all and it actually made my hair worse.  The Sleek and Shine Sheer Conditioning Glaze also made my hair (and my daughters&#x27; hair) feel like straw and very sticky and dry.  I have tried the Brilliante Shine Glassing Spray which I like and I&#x27;m going to try the Anti Frizz Serum.  I have to say, I did call the company to let them know that this product was very frustrating and didn&#x27;t work at all and they had excellent customer service.  I do love their shampoo and conditioners and I&#x27;m looking forward to trying some of their skincare products.</li>
    <li> Do NOT purchase this!!! I have NEVER smelled anything quite like this! When they say \\&quot;lasts up to 7 shampoos,\\&quot; they are talking about the smell, not the results! I put this in my hair last night, and the sealing cream left my hair all heavy and kinda greasy (I may have used too much), but the worst part was the smell! After blow drying it and straightening it like the instructions said, I washed it FIVE TIMES. Then I washed it first thing this morning, and it STILL stinks! I have wavy, thick hair, and if I blow dry/straighten my hair after using this product, it is definitely straighter and smoother, but it looks and feels a whole lot less healthy.  After washing it all night last night, I didn&#x27;t bother with drying it because I knew I would wash it again this morning, and with no blow drying/straightening, it looked MUCH frizzier than it usually does...probably because it fried and/or dried out my hair.  DO NOT USE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I just moved to Florida, and wanted something to seal the humidity out.  I have very thick, somewhat wavy hair that&#x27;s normally easy to style, and has a lot of body.  I just wanted to avoid frizz.    Those who say that it smells bad aren&#x27;t kidding - rotten eggs.  I should have just washed it back out again, but I was afraid that the following cream might have a neutralizer that it needed. I noticed when I was rinsing it out in the shower that some of my HAIR DYE was coming out with it - not a good sign.     Washed it out, and my hair felt gummy, even after I shampooed.  It is totally limp, and I can&#x27;t even style it with a curling iron - it won&#x27;t hold a curl. Feels like it takes LONGER to blow dry, not shorter, and it won&#x27;t let me style it as I dry - just comes out flat. Body or bounce?  Forget about it!!!  I now shampoo twice every time I shower, it&#x27;s been more than a week, and no improvement. I have never had any problems with my hair - I&#x27;m devastated.  Worst thing that I ever did to my hair, and that includes the too-curly perms that I had in the past - at least I could smooth those out with hot rollers or a curling iron!!!  Update:  I got an email from Garnier to call them after I posted this review.  I called the number that they gave me, and interestingly enough, \\&quot;if you are calling about the blow dry perfector\\&quot; has its own prompt, so they must be receiving a number of calls.  The person on the phone was very defensive, to the point of being rude.  I told her that I shampooed my hair twice a day for a week, so if the product was temporary, it should be gone. She said that 14 shampoos were not the same as 14 days. I pointed out that the box says that it only lasts for SEVEN shampoos. She said that people don&#x27;t wash their hair every day, so it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean seven days.  Huh?  Anyway, it&#x27;s still limp as ever, won&#x27;t curl at all, and now I have breakage at the ends that I didn&#x27;t have before.  So after being snotty to me, the rep said that they will send mecoupons for more Garnier products.  Terrific.  There&#x27;s a class action suit right now for Garnier Sleek and Shine, because it&#x27;s FLAMMABLE.  I guess I should be glad that this one didn&#x27;t set my head on fire!!!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m not a chemist, but i&#x27;m telling you that this product has a chemical relaxer in it and, if you have a perm in your hair, it will remove it.  the first part of the treatment is a product that smells like a perm. you leave it on for 20 min.  (now i know that was a chemical relaxer). then you put on what must be a keratin treatment that you have to seal onto the hair with a flat iron.  it works pretty well if you want straight hair, but if you want to keep your curls, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  i read the entire box and it said nothing about straightening hair.  it shows pictures of curly hair, it says it lasts up to 7 washes (suggesting that it will completely wash out if you don&#x27;t like it), it says it&#x27;s ok to use on permed hair, and it says that if you want to wear your hair curly, just not to blowdry it.  it says nowhere that this product will reverse a perm, which is exactly what it did.  if you have a perm you don&#x27;t like, what you&#x27;re supposed to do is run another perm through your hair for a few minutes without rolling it, and it will relax the perm.  that&#x27;s exactly what this product did to my hair. so, i recommend it if you want straight hair, but not if you like your perm.</li>
    <li> This stuff has a worse sulfur smell than a perm!! Stay away!!! my red hair color is stripped as well. this stuff is absolutely awful.</li>
    <li> This is the worst mistake I ever made. I followed the directions and like others noticed the solution has a sulfuric smell similar to a perm solution. After rinsing my hair felt dry. The product also pulled most of my professional colir out, even though I waited more than 14 days to use this let directions.  I used step two and dried my hair and noticed it was heavy and lifeless. That night my roots were super greasy and I had to wash my hair. Two weeks later and my hair is still lifeless and heavy with greasy roots hours after washing. Do not biy.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews while the product was on my head. I was nervous but it was too late. Rinsed. Applied step two. Blow dry and flat iron and my hair was definitely easier to manage. I&#x27;ll update in a few days... But so far I&#x27;m impressed with the ease of styling and the sikyness of my hair. I left the product on for exactly 17 min because my hair isn&#x27;t super curly... Maybe this is the key??</li>
    <li> My hair is thick and wavy.  I live in an area with dry heat so humidity wasn&#x27;t the issue but blow-drying my hair always left it looking like a frizz ball. I strayed away from the Brazilian blow-out because of the chemicals and the cost.  For me this product was just O.K.  I&#x27;m on the fence about whether I&#x27;ll use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down-side:&lt;br /&gt;*Smell of the relaxer is pretty bad.  And wasn&#x27;t really helped by the conditioning cream&lt;br /&gt;*It should only be used by people with certain hair textures&lt;br /&gt;*I noticed some dryness after blow-drying that couldn&#x27;t be helped with other products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up-side:&lt;br /&gt;*Blow drying produced much less frizz&lt;br /&gt;*Cost is reasonable&lt;br /&gt;*And my hair is straight but still has the body it always had</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product to try out -- well, let me tell you, it smells soooo bad that I couldn&#x27;t even get past that! It is so chemical smelling and it literally stinks to high heaven. I was afraid of burning my scalp and after seeing so many other reviews about damaged hair, I feared trying it any further!</li>
    <li> I have hair like the 2nd picture on the back of the product package. Defintely not worth what I paid; they should be paying me for trying it. I&#x27;ve had curly-wavy hair all my life.     Used as directed. Shampooed, towel dried, and then added the product, combed it through. Kept the step 1 rinse on 25 minutes and rinsed it out and toweled dry. UGH! My hair has never been so tangled - it was truly horrid.  The detangling experience was akin to washing my hair in Irish Spring bar soap without conditioner. Took me 7 minutes to comb out - and broke a lot of hair off.     After blow drying and using the flat iron, it&#x27;s still frizzy. No change. Plus the product leaves a heavy yucky coat over the hair - and a lot of broken hair. If you have curly-wavy frizzy hair, buy a good conditioner and leave it in for 20 minutes -- and skip this product.</li>
    <li> Be careful.  It was very strange, but this product really damaged my hair.  I have Japanese Straightening so my best guess is that it was a bad reaction with that.  I would definitely tell anyone with their hair chemically straightened to steer clear.  I really do a lot to maintain the health of my hair, so this experience was pretty devastating.</li>
    <li> I also received this product as a BzzAgent.  I was excited to try it as I flat iron my hair everyday.  I was hoping that my hair would stay smoother longer and I wouldn&#x27;t need to flat iron my whole head as often.  The first thing I noticed was the horrible smell.  I kept the product on my head the entire time, but I was tempted to wash it out early just to get rid of the smell.  The smell was better after I washed, but every time you blow dry for the first 2-3 days, the smell comes back.  If that wasn&#x27;t bad enough, after my hair was dry it felt like straw.  It was actually harder to flat iron with this coarse, dry texture I was left with.  The good news is that after washing again, the straw-like feeling was gone.  I did not see any improvement in the speed of blow drying or flat ironing and I didn&#x27;t notice any improvements in the appearance of my hair.  I would definitely not recommed this product.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this product from bzzagent.com to try and comment.  Just to warn everyone, this stuff smells awful.  It is supposed to last for 7 washes, so to make it last I didn&#x27;t wash every day, so I was stuck with awful smelling hair for two days.  As for the straighting ease, it worked ok.  It made my hair pretty straight with just the blow dryer for a couple days, but then I traveled to Florida, where no amount of any product could help the frizziness the humidity caused.  My hair looked like a birds&#x27; nest there.  Anyway, this stuff worked ok back in the dry climate, but I don&#x27;t think I will ever use it again.  As for the other reviews that say it fried their hair, I didn&#x27;t get that, but the texture did feel different for a day or two after, but went back to normal after a few washes.  Its not supposed to be permanent anyway.</li>
    <li> If you want yet another item to add to your beauty product dud graveyard, this is the product for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, wavy/soft curls, and blow dry my hair often. It is not very difficult for me to blow dry my hair straight, but I figured anything that makes it a little easier might be worth a try. This product simply does nothing except damage your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the \\&quot;solution\\&quot; smells revolting. There is no way this stuff isn&#x27;t totally toxic and awful for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the \\&quot;heat-activated straightening creme\\&quot; actually made blow drying more difficult. My hair was tangly and stinky and almost immediately started to curl and frizz after drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, its promise to \\&quot;last up to 7 shampoos\\&quot; is a joke! It didn&#x27;t even help keep hair straight through the first application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, please don&#x27;t waste your time. If it doesn&#x27;t work for women like me who have easy-to-straighten hair, there is no way this will work for women with curlier hair. We don&#x27;t need yet another junk beauty product that promises more than it can deliver. I wish I could give this zero stars.</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping that it would help keep my hair smooth and tangle free.  The 20min serum smells like nair (so like dead fish) and I was worried it would have the same effect! Thankfully my hair wasn&#x27;t damaged but I felt like I could still smell the serum even after the heat activated cream. My boyfriend and roommate said they didn&#x27;t smell the fishy smell after I used the creme but I felt like I could still smell it. My hair did seem smoother and didn&#x27;t get tangled as easily but it defiantly doesn&#x27;t last 7 shampoos like it says it will. I used it Saturday and by today (Monday) my hair is like it used to be. I could not waste your money (or time) on this product.</li>
    <li> I was leary about trying this product especially since it is sold over the counter, but I am so very glad I did.  I have very baby fine hair and even though my hair style is supposed to be sleek and smooth, and I use salon products to manage my hair, NOTHING worked.    Tried this product last week, and not only is my hair not frizzy or fly away, but I don&#x27;t have to flatiron my hair after blow drying.  It looks great after the blow dry!!!!!    TRY THIS!!!!</li>
    <li> I had not even heard about this product until last week when I saw it in Allure&#x27;s Best of Beauty 2010 app. As someone who flat irons every day I though this might help save some time. I have thick wavy hair and lots of it. I followed the instructions to the letter. While I had the product in my hair I googled it to see how other people&#x27;s hair had turned out and was horrified to read the reviews! Breakage, damage, etc. I was so scared but finished the process and was pleasantly surprised when, as I was drying and flat ironing It was super shiny and straighter than it had ever been.   I started thinking that the negative reviewers were crazy and didn&#x27;t follow directions properly. Well that was until I did my first shampoo!  All the luster and shininess was gone.  It&#x27;s now day 4 since I applied it and I&#x27;ve washed my hair 3 times. It feels horrible and dry. My hair was naturally shiny and soft before. I see a lot of little hairs at the top of my head standing straight up which means it&#x27;s broken. My hair was healthy before. I hadn&#x27;t colored in over 3 years and although I flat iron every day I always use an iron guard and good shampoos and conditioners.  I wish I had investigated this product before I bought it.  I&#x27;m going to contact Garnier and complain although from what I read they won&#x27;t do anything. I&#x27;m just lucky it didn&#x27;t break off completely. And I&#x27;ll stress again I FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS TO THE LETTER and MY HAIR WAS HEALTHY!</li>
    <li> I cant believe so many people hate this product. It made my hair VERY soft and silky. I have very course thick curly hair so maybe its ment just for hair like mine (it says that right on the box btw)I will be using this again Ive never had hair so soft and under control. My husband loved it. My only complaint is that its VERY smelly right after you use it and it feel like theres a thick coat of crap on your hair. But it goes away after the first wash. I was scared and super bummed at first but like I said after you wash again WOW!</li>
    <li> This product was the worst mistake I made! My long hair (once down my back ) is gone. Cut into a short pixie cut and still braking off. I am going in for another hair trim next week to try to even out the breakage once again. My hair had to be cut 2 inches from my scalp because of this product. I feel bad for anyone who has gone through what I went through. As I read the other posts It is like the words are coming out of my mouth. I am wondering why the news hasn&#x27;t done a story on this product and how many woman have lost there hair due to this product,</li>
    <li> All of hair is distroyed, I have never experenced this sort of damagehrough in my life and my hair is pretty durable, I&#x27;m sure there will be a class action law suit as this product is irresponsible and defective.  I just spent 500 dollars and all day at a salon to have 9 inches of my hair chopped and I was told to consider wearing a wig.  I never want to go in public again.</li>
    <li> DO NOT GET THIS!!!! I had purple hair that was about an inch from my shoulders... i decided to use this to maybe shine it up a bit... i followed the directions, and after i did the last step, my hair BROKE OFF about three inches!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT USE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought a couple packs of this product without reading any reviews.  I have fairly straight hair that&#x27;s prone to fizzing, and thought this would keep the frizzies at bay during an upcoming family reunion/beach vacation.  I was going to do a test run tonight, and figured I would read some reviews for a helpful hint or two.  WOW!  Looks like the best helpful hint is to throw the product right into the trash - which is what I did.  Thank you to everyone who posted about the long-lasting damage this product did to their hair....thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> Not a bad price, but doesn&#x27;t actually do any straightening, nor does it keep it straight once you have ironed it.  It did get rid of the frizzies fairly well. (I have very thick hair.) And as promised it lasted about 7 washes.  Disappointed that it didn&#x27;t stay straight, but c&#x27;est la vie.</li>
    <li> I have always had really nice and shiny/bouncy hair, even with highlighting and color treating it...Because of all of the humidity and the tendency for my hair to get really wavy I thought I&#x27;d try this product to give my hair a \\&quot;boost\\&quot;.  WELL..Never in my life have I ever had my hair so damaged as it has after using this product.  The box says to not use on DAMAGED highlighted hair but it&#x27;s SAFE to use on highlighted color-treated hair.  My hair is highlighted/color treated and while anyone who colors there hair knows that unless your hair is virgin it&#x27;s not completely healthy, it still was not damaged in any way before I used this product!!  It COMPLETELY FRIED my hair!! My hair strands look \\&quot;frizzled\\&quot; and break off constantly and I&#x27;ve had to constantly snip away hoping to salvage as much as I can. Sadly, the only remedy is to cut off as much of my hair as possible or wait for this mess to grow out.       DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I am quite surprised at the negative reviews about this product.  I have used it three or four times over two years!  It lasts longer than the advertised seven shampoos -- in fact, the first time I used it it kept my hair frizz-free for nearly a year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair -- colored blonde for thirty years, quite curly and the first time I used the product I had walked three blocks in DC humidity and it had frizzed badly.  So I was delighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I did not rinse the solution out completely and I could smell a mild \\&quot;permanent\\&quot; smell until I washed it again.  After that, I have been careful to rinse the solution thoroughly and all has been good.  I did experience a little bit of breakage but not enough to prevent me from using this product.</li>
    <li> Let me begin by saying that Garnier Fructis is the only shampoo and conditioner that both my boyfriend and I use. We love the way their products work, as well as the wonderful way they smell!  I followed the directions exactly and unfortunately, I was disappointed with the Sleek and Shine Blow Dry Perfector Kit. The directions mentioned that you might notice a smell with the Smooth-It Serum, but I was not expecting a very strong perm scent. Luckily the Heat-Activated Perfect-It Cream had a nice, familiar Garnier smell. Initially, the kit worked to straighten my hair, but it definitely did not last the seven shampoos that I was hoping for. In addition, my hair is much drier and more brittle than before and even after several shampoos, still has a faint smell of perm. I regret to say that I cannot recommend this product. However I do still love Garnier products and from now on will stick to the Straightening Balm and Mist.</li>
    <li> This is the worst product I have ever used! I used this back in July 2011 thinking it would be an easy fix for a boating/camping weekend. Here it is March 2012 and I&#x27;m still dealing with the MAJOR damage. If you love your hair, or even like it a little bit, DO NOT USE! I have had to cut so much of my hair it&#x27;s ridiculous. I don&#x27;t know how anyone could in good faith give this horrible product a good review. Must be a Garnier employee or something. If you like having hair, do not even attempt this.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I go to walgreens and purchse this stuff, suave also has the same product, why not I say...I&#x27;ll give it a try, the lady said it&#x27;s not a chemical, won&#x27;t damage your hair.... WRONG!  obviously she didn&#x27;t know what she is talking about, just another sales person working in the cosmetic dept, not a real beautician.  That being said, I followed the instructions to the letter, my hair is almost to my shoulders, wavy hair naturally, the product is very much a chemical processor, it first is opening up the cutical on the hair shaft ( just like a perm )than the second product is almost like liquid hair spray that is going to penatrate those open hair shafts, this is where the heat comes in play, you apply heat to make the product you just put on a solid not a liquid anymore. You will get the same results by putting a real good leave in conditioner in your hair, blow it out or iron it and then spray your head with a real good hair spray.  DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT OR THE ONE FROM SUAVE.  THEY WILL DAMAGE YOUR HAIR.  Wait at least one day and put on a real good intensive moisturizer hair pack on your hair if you have used this product.  Do Not use this product if you die your hair blond, this peroxide solution in blond hair die is too high and this product will fry your hair.</li>
    <li> Interesting that Amazon have reduced the price to $4.49. They must be aware of the terrible reviews and should remove this product from their site!  My local CVS won&#x27;t sell this product or the very similar Suave product because of all the complaints they have been receiving.  A number of local hair salons have put warning notices in their windows about both products because they have seen so many clients come in asking them to fix the damage.</li>
    <li> Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for still selling this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal USA Inc. is entangled in a consumer fraud lawsuit filed by disgruntled consumers who claim one of its hair products damaged their tresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Law360 (subscription required) reports that the class-action lawsuit, filed in California Superior Court in Los Angeles, claims that the cosmetics giant continues to sell and market its Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine Blow Dry Perfector as leaving hair \\&quot;silky smooth\\&quot; and \\&quot;frizz resistant,\\&quot; despite the company&#x27;s knowledge that the product may cause users to experience hair loss and other damage. Plaintiffs claim that they experienced irreversible hair breakage and loss or have seen their hair become dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The complaint states: \\&quot;Defendants have knowledge that the Blow Dry Perfector damages consumers&#x27; hair, but continue to sell the product without warning the public of the potential risk of harm, all for defendants&#x27; profit and to the detriment of unsuspecting consumers.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal warns visitors to its website to test the product on a section of the hair before applying it to the entire head, but this warning does not on the product&#x27;s box, according to the lawsuit. Nor is there a warning anywhere that the use of the product as directed could cause hair breakage and loss, contend the plaintiffs.</li>
    <li> I have used blow dry perfector for the past 2 years just to loosen my curls.  It really makes a difference for my course thick hair that sucks up moisture all day long.  I have used a rolling blow dryer on flat iron on my hair with this product, but with the humidity being so high, I only flat iron it during the winter months.  This product helps to elongate my natural curls without over straightening them.  I will apply blow dry perfector for the maximum amount of time, then rinse, blow dry with diffuser, then rinse again to remove any buildup from product and it helps with the smell as well.  Then I use my other moisturizers to create the desired look I am going for when were my hair naturally curly.  I would recommend this product for anyone whom like to were their hair naturally curly, but want them to loosen up.</li>
    <li> This stuff ruined my hair!  I caused breakage and continues to break as a result of using it.  It creates a film on your hair and every time I comb my hair after (it&#x27;s been 2 weeks) more falls out.  Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> My daughter is mixed and has very curly, very course hair. This stuff worked like a charm!!! Her hair has never turned out so good! I will say that she did wash it AND condition it first, then we put on the serum for 20 minutes. We rinsed, blow dryed with a straightening brush, then flat ironed. Her hair is so soft and just looks awesome! I&#x27;m guessing with all the negative reviews tho, they will discontinue the product, which would really suck :(</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews of this product. I imagine it depends on the texture of your hair, but for me, someone with lots of body who fights humidity and frizz on a daily basis, this product is a Godsend.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it a number of times and it really is the only product I have tried that has made a significant impact in my ability to style my hair and tame my frizz. My styling routine is exactly the same - it doesn&#x27;t diminish the time I spend under the blow dryer and I still flat iron every time I dry my hair - but the result is a smoother, sleeker style than what I get without the product.</li>
    <li> I received this product from Bzzagent to try, i was really excited to try something that would save time and make my hair look nice.Well the product didn&#x27;t work for me as i though it would.I followed the instructions but got no real results!My hair has no shine and is dry now.I have wavy hair and was hoping for an easy fix through this product but it did not happen.I&#x27;m glad i got to try it before i purchased it.</li>
    <li> I thought my tresses were beyond repair.  Too many years of coloring; blow drying; curling irons and electric rollers left my hair greatly damaged and super dry.  As a member of Bzz Agent, I was given the wonderful opportunity to try this new product by Garnier Fructis.  I really didn&#x27;t expect much of a change because nothing seemed to work for any length of time in the past.  I seen some change after the first application and by the fifth I was in total amazement.  My hair was smooth and silky again.  It could hold a style and I did not have to worry about \\&quot;curls falling out\\&quot;.  Yes, Garnier Fructis Blow Dry Perfector really does an awesome job and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My hair is normally curly to wavy and I like to wear it straight in the fall and winter so I decided to give the blow dry perfector a try, just so I could cut down on blow drying time in the morning. My mom is a beautician and told me it would be a bad idea to do this. I should have listened. The first cream that you have to leave in your hair for 20 minutes had me gagging. One can not BEGIN to explain how horrible it smells and the worst part is, you CAN&#x27;T shampoo your hair after the 20 minutes are up; you can just rinse it out. Although the heat activated conditioning cream smells better, its not enough to over power the first so the chemical oder lingers.     The stuff lightened my hair color A LOT. My hair is a chestnut color and now it looks almost red. The last time I had colored my hair before the blow dry perfector was about a month ago, so there should have been no kind of chemical reaction. Although my hair doesn&#x27;t look any worse, it doesn&#x27;t look any better either. My scalp is a whole lot drier, though. I get the same results when I just wash, condition and blow it out. I just spent an extra $10 for added agrivation. Also lost about 3 pounds, throwing up for 2 days. Even though I washed my hair the second day cause I couldn&#x27;t stand the stench, I could swear that I could still smell it!! Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
    <li> My hair is thick and wavy/super frizzy. I also color my hair. I was so hopeful this product would work! I should have looked here first for a review and would have saved me from some serious repair work on my hair.  I agree with other reviewers, it did strip color from my hair and left it with a bad brassy/orangey color. Can&#x27;t believe I have to wait two weeks now to fix my color! It also didn&#x27;t help my hair at all to be \\&quot;sleeker\\&quot; and \\&quot;shinier\\&quot;. It is now very coarse and looks horrible due to the color change/ texture change. Even two rounds with my flat iron can&#x27;t tame this beast I now have! Oh, and the smell! If you read this and don&#x27;t believe us not to use it, and you do try it; be sure to do it in a room with a window that opens! The directions should have read Step 1- open window, Step 2, direct a fan to blow the horrible odor out that open window. I had high hopes for this product. Sadly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I did not read any reviews before buying this product, and if I did I would have missed out. I spontaneously purchased this after talking about making my hair more smooth. As it says on the directions, the step 1 cream does stink. After rinsing my hair it felt a bit tangled, but once using step 2 it was perfect. My hair felt great, I locked in the treatment by blowdrying it. I have really curly hair so I did not see much of a difference here. However, my hair blowdried straight much easier and it took me 17 minutes to straighten my hair which is a new record. It normally takes me about 25-30. I will definately use this product again.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product.  I was really looking forward to having smooth sleek shiny hair.  My hair was in pretty good condition prior to using this junk.  I used it exactly as stated and  I could tell before I even started up the blow dryer that my hair was damaged it felt terrible even wet. After I blew it dry and flat ironed it my hair looks so damaged.    It has almost been a week since I used it &amp; I was in a hurry this morning and thought that I would give my hair a rest and let it dry naturally. OMG!!! My once curly hair looks like a fuzz ball I just want to cry.   Now have to get take a vacation day off from work and spend my hard earned money to get several inches of my hair cut off &amp; I am not happy at all with this.    If you do decide to use this just make sure you have the extra cash set aside for an emergency haircut.</li>
    <li> This is the biggest product regret I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.  It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks since I used this product and I followed it to a T.  I&#x27;m so disgusted by it.  My hair was long and wavy and I sometimes had frizz, so I thought this product seemed like a dream solution, but from the moment I rinsed it out of my hair and couldn&#x27;t comb through my hair, I knew I was in trouble.  My hair is completely fried and damaged.  It is still difficult to comb through out of the shower and while blow drying, and that is even after I&#x27;ve done a deep conditioning treatment.  I&#x27;m going to a stylist soon to see if there is any hope of fixing it. I&#x27;ll never complain about my hair again if only I could get my old hair back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product it works wonders</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews for this product before purchasing it and was nervous as lots of people seemed to strongly dislike it.  I have thick, wavy, dry hair that gets frizzy in the summer from the humidity.  I wanted something that would help keep my hair smooth and this product works like a charm (I ordered four more boxes in case Garnier discontinues it).  The treatment doesn&#x27;t smell good, but it doesn&#x27;t linger once you rinse it out.  I can go natural or straight now without the frizz and my hair has more movement and body because I&#x27;m not torching it with a flatiron/curling iron as much.</li>
    <li> this is a really bad product, it does the opposite to your hair - dries it out and makes it even more frizzy. wish i read the reviews&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> Same story as everyone else on here. I used the product per the instructions, the smell was terrible and half my hair went down the drain when I was combing it out. I nearly cried. I am so disgusted with myself for even picking up this product. I plan to spend the next few days doing coconut oil treatments and praying for the best. This product needs to be discontinued.</li>
    <li> I bought this through a local Ulta store but since I live on Amazon I wanted to see others peoples review of this product.  I have to say I freaked out a bit because as I was reading the other reviews I had the smelly serum on my hair.  I have to say it does smell as bad as or worse as a home perm.  I don&#x27;t think any of the other reviews indicated if they used the whole bottle or not but I have to say I am pleased with the results I obtained.  My hair is shoulder length and fine but I still have a hard time getting a sleek look with a flat iron.  I chose to only use about 1/4 of the bottle of serum...and now am thankful I did as based on the other reviews had I used more it might have turned out bad.  I kept hearing that age old advice \\&quot;less is more\\&quot; so proceeded with caution.  My advice to anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried it yet but would like to..start out with less product and see how that turns out.    Update:  5/21/11  I just used this product again and I like it.  It works for me, makes my hair straighter, more manageable, shiny and soft.  I feel really bad for all the ladies that are having problems.  I can say I still won&#x27;t use the whole bottle on my hair.  I only use about 1/4 to 1/3 and that works for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and was really anxious to see the results. I have curly hair and I blow dry my hair straight all the time. Unfortunately, this product was nothing what I expected. After rinsing it off, it was almost impossible to brush my hair and it really seemed damaged. I was not too worried because I thought that the step 2 crème will make it better. Well, it didn&#x27;t. I have to say hair is really straight, even without using iron, but it does appear damaged. Just to be clear, my hair did not look damaged or dry before using this product. I am not sure if the overall effect is really worth it.</li>
    <li> This product will ruin the most healthy hair out there. Please do not buy it! It was worse drying time, my hair has horrible split ends, and there is no shine at all. Don&#x27;t risk your hair on this product, I would rather have colored my hair orange than have to repair the damage here!    GARNIER- TAKE THIS OFF THE MARKET NOW!</li>
    <li> I tried this stuff and HATE IT! I followed the directions to a T. My hair waS falling out in clumps then it was left brittal and hay like. Yes it was very straight 10 Days later my hair is still bone straight and dead feeling. It took all of the moister out of my hair. I tried to curl my hair with a curling iron and it wont budge. I would love for this to be out of my hair. I suggest YOU DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
    <li> Update: here is how I got my hair back to healthy. It is still thinner than befor and I can&#x27;t pull my hair back without seein scalp. There is hope!!! See my pics for what this did to my hair.  [...]  I wish I had read reviews before buying this product. I have beautiful naturally curly hair and alwas have.....well until now. It has been MONThS since I&#x27;ve used this product and my hair is still damaged and I wonder if it will ever be repaired. My ends are fried. I had my hair cut just weeks ago to get rid of all the damage from this poduct and the ends re split!!! I&#x27;ve already spent over $100 to try to ge my hair back to healthy including buying expensive salon products including s factor serious conditioner morocan oil and other tigi and bed head products. I have bald patches that you can see when I tie my hair back. My hair use to beshiny curly and full of life and now it is dry damaged and limp. I hope and pray the damage is not permanent although I can&#x27;t think of much more to do besides cutting all my hair off and DO NOT buy. Garnier/loreal should be sued for all the damage and destruction the have caused.</li>
    <li> My hair is very straight and fine, and in the humidity it turns wavy and looks just awful, even though I have a short hair style.  I tried this and it&#x27;s made all the difference.  I was even able to grow my hair longer (until I got tired of it!) -- something I was never able to do because once summer came it looked terrible, no matter how much work I put into blow drying, moussing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product two years ago and it made all the difference.  For about two weeks (I wash my hair every other day) my hair looked great!  No matter how damp from rain or humidity, my hair retained its perfect, blow-dried look.  It does smell pretty nasty, but once you&#x27;ve rinsed it out the odor is gone within minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me, and for anyone else who came to rely on this, it looks as though it&#x27;s been discontinued.  Therefore, I&#x27;m snapping it up everywhere I can find it!  I can&#x27;t tell you how it will work for thick, coarse or very curly hair, but if your hair is (supposed to be) straight, and it has a very fine texture, this works like a charm.</li>
    <li> This damaged my hair very badly.  It is now thin and frizzy and the split ends are worse than ever.  I cannot believe this product is still on the market after all of these horrible reviews.  please don&#x27;t buy this product</li>
    <li> I bought this product back in early October.  I parted off my bangs and used just a tiny bit of product on them.  Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t put it on my entire head.  My bangs have almost entirely broken off.  I look rediculous.  My hair is color treated but it usually looked pretty shiny and healthy.  Now my bangs are very short and I look rediculous!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of fine straightish hair. I get weird bumps and waves. I use a heat protexx by nexxus and CHI shampoo, conditioner and Serum occasionally. My hair is in decent condition, not too dry, but it is deposit colored with a semi permanent color every 4-6 weeks. (at home) My hair is usually very easy to blow out, but gets some frizz if I Don&#x27;t blow it completely dry.     I bought this about a month ago, and since I was coloring my hair, I couldn&#x27;t do both at the same time. I like what the color does to my hair&#x27;s texture, so I figured I could use this between colors to extend that feeling.     I followed the instructions completely. SPECIFICALLY, the first step solution is not to go all the way to the roots. (and to be fair, my hair may have been wetter than towel dried) It only goes from somewhere in the middle to the ends. I combed it through and it smelled AWFUL! I mean, awful... (I use this natural spray on my plants made from putrescent eggs and garlic to keep the rabbits away, and this smelled that bad)    Then waiting, I pulled up the reviews and kind of freaked, (and the smell was awful) but I was still gonna give it a try... I rinsed it out VERY WELL. My hair&#x27;s texture seemed a bit stiff, but this also happens when I use my semipermanent hair color, and resolves itself with the conditioner so I wasn&#x27;t panicked.    I put the second step on my hair, on every strand. I am not an expert, but I think it may have to work with the first step, so I made sure to get it from roots to tip as explained in the instructions. The second step did not get the entire awful smell out of my hair, but it was a huge improvement.     I started blowdrying right away, which is a hard judgement, since I typically wait until my hair is nearly dry before I blow it out. My hair was STRAIGHT, I mean STRAIGHT, and the comb went straight through it... It felt a little dried out, but as I applied the heat, it seemed to smooth out. I loved the effect once I &#x27;thought&#x27; it was dry. I flatironed it and it got smoother. When I realized that it wasn&#x27;t COMPLETELY DRY, I dried it some more. the more I dried and flat ironed, the smoother and shinier it became. This stuff is truly heat activated. My hair is now looking like a million bucks, and I am not great at blowouts at all!!    I noticed a very slight lift to my hair color. I typically dye it a shade darker than it is, with a semi-permanent color, so it lightens as I shampoo anyway, so this wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me. I use brass free hair color, so it didn&#x27;t lighten brassy at all, but I suppose it could, if the color I use didn&#x27;t have that much toning shade in it. I did seem to have a few more grays peeking out, but I hope the additional shine will hide it.     Admittedly, my color does give me an &#x27;artifical&#x27; shine and sleekness that I like. If you want a natural smooth conditioning treatment, THIS is not for you. It is a chemical. It smells like perm solution and frankly, if I recall, works the same way (the solution then the other stuff that neutralizes the solution)    I doubt that I will get a huge time savings in drying my hair, but I do like how it looks now. I have seen this compared to a straightener and I would agree that it seems to have the same effect.    I lost more hair with my color than I did with this stuff. I am giving it 3 stars because I think the instructions are not clear enough to ensure that the solution is appropriately applied, the second solution must be applied well, and HEAT will make it work better. And the smell was awful.     I am not sure if I&#x27;d use it again, but that is just the smell and the potential damage it may be causing long term.    12/31/2010: I am following up to my intial review after two weeks and a color treatment (Semi permanent)  My hair is much sleeker than it was the last time I colored. It still has maintained some of the nice shiny straight effect from the past two weeks.     My color seemed to grab my gray hairs better, which was a nice bonus. Ihave just a few split ends, but I am overdue for a trim, (It&#x27;s been over two months) so this could be expected.     I did notice a significant reduction in the time it takes my hair to dry. Usually I can go an hour until I have to blowdry, and now my hair is almost dry at 45 minutes. My hair does dry quickly and it dries straighter and shinier and way softer than it used to. I only have to touch it up lightly with the iron in the morning and I am good to go. I have recieved a fair amount of compliments on my hair in the past two weeks, so I am pleased with the product.      The smell did remain in my hair when it was wet for a few shampoos, but it goes away when my hair dried.     My advice is to remember to rinse out step one VERY WELL, and make sure step two coats the entire hair shaft completely, from root to tip. When drying/ironing your hair the first time, make sure to keep going until it is bone dry, and do it again.</li>
    <li> This product smells like perm water because it probably is perm water with ammonia. It will fry your hair and you will end up having to cut it. DO NOT USE!!!! I normally give 5 stars to good products, this is a terrible product!!</li>
    <li> Ok, here&#x27;s the deal.  People seem to either LOVE or HATE this product and after reading the reviews and trying it for myself, I&#x27;m beginning to get a sense that it works better on people that already had damaged, frizzy hair.  Those that reviewed it negatively typically mention that they once had \\&quot;gorgeous\\&quot; hair that is now \\&quot;ruined\\&quot;.  I am the total opposite.  After years of brittle, damaged hair and trying EVERYTHING on the market ($1 to $500 dollars!) to fix it, this is the FIRST THING THAT&#x27;S WORKED FOR ME!  I know the package says NOT to use it on damaged hair but I tend to experiment a lot and figured \\&quot;what else do I have to lose- it cant get much worse at this point!\\&quot;  I have to say, for me the product did everything it promised and more.  My once \\&quot;Weird Al Yankovic\\&quot; looking hair is now straight, shiny and getting lots of positive attention from those that know my hair woes well.  It&#x27;s even become healthier and stronger  This is coming from a girl so obsessed with curing her damaged hair that she clips split ends before bed at night- I know what my hair looks like up close! :) The catch is that my hair was NEVER HEALTHY TO BEGIN WITH and this IMPROVED ITS HEALTH AND TEXTURE.  From reading other people&#x27;s reviews, this product doesnt seem ideal if you have healthy hair already.  So please read my review with that in mind...good luck!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I did this to my hair.  I always go to a salon for color or any treatment.  I never do \\&quot;home\\&quot; products.  I thought this was a sleeking and conditioning product.  NO NO NO.  My hair is fried and falling out in clumps.  I have highlighted hair that WAS in great condition.  Not anymore.  I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do.  I hope there is a class action suit for this product.  If you read the reviews, you know why.  I didn&#x27;t read them before hand.  The instructions do not say do a test strand (web site does).  It says ok to use on highlighted hair in good condition 2 weeks before or after.  It had been a month since I had color.  It is now many shades and stripped.  Website says they do not recommend it for hightlighted.  Whats up with that.  I  am going to call them and see what they suggest (after I air out my house from the smell.  This is just bizarre.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to use this product after I read everything posted about it. I was out shopping one day and say this blowdry perfecter and thought it sounded awesome so i bought it. I just so happened to be on amazon later that night, buying some makeup, when i saw it and the feedback it was getting. I almost didn&#x27;t even use it because of all the people saying it damaged their hair, ect.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I sucked it up and went for it. Yes, step one smells AWFUL. But it&#x27;s no worse than all those old school perm and relaxants. It didn&#x27;t burn me, it didn&#x27;t ruin my hair, I&#x27;m not having to sue people...&lt;br /&gt;It actually worked alright, made my hair straighter and shiner, and even seemed to boost my color! Now about the lasting for seven washes...that&#x27;s not totally true in my case. It lasted about 4 for me. I&#x27;ll totally use this again...but at $11 for one use, I think it&#x27;ll be for special occasions.</li>
    <li> I use their shampoo and conditioner, but I am very disappointed with their sleek and shine product.  Following the instructions exactly, my hair ended up LESS smooth than before.  It is now very dry and damaged.  I will not be using this product EVER again.</li>
    <li> I just used this product to help straighten hair that is too wavy to dry straight but not curly. I had long shiny healthy hair until Sunday when I used this product and now it is like every other hair is split. And not just split but shredded! And there are splits all the way up the hair shaft! DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!! I have been growing my hair for my upcoming wedding and it is past my bra line and now I think I am going to have to cut at least 8 inches off!!! SO DEVASTATED!!!!</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE WORST THING I HAVE EVER DONE TO MY HAIR.  Immediately after following the directions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot;, the ends of my hair, about 5 inches of, felt and sounded like crackling dry leaves.  It was horrific.  They frizzed out,(SO MUCH FOR SLEEKNESS AND SHINE) and had to get 5 inches cut off my hair!!  It was destroyed.  I buy Garnier and love their products, their shampoos and conditioners, sprays and gels are all top notch.  I am shocked at them and just how terrible this product was.  I followed it to a T, and would caution anyone curious not to buy this product.  I started getting suspicious when the gel you apply smelled like rancid eggs, it reeked throughout the house!  Just a horrorshow, beginning to end.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read these reviews before using this product. Fortunately, unlike many others, the worst effect I had was that my scalp was suuuuper irritated after usage. I followed the instructions faithfully and didn&#x27;t rub the product in, but goodness my head was so itchy, it was really embarrassing. My hair was also quite oily for a week or two, the feeling you get if you don&#x27;t get all the shampoo out, but you do? It was awful.    Long story short, the worst part of this product is that it doesn&#x27;t work. I have curly frizzy hair, and I&#x27;m used to blow drying my hair and straightening. I was hoping that this product would at the very least cut down on my prep time. It did the opposite. The oily texture and irritation really prevented me from styling it in a way that I liked and it took so much longer in the shower to get it clearn.    Bottom line: just don&#x27;t do it. I wish I could get back my $10 and the three weeks I wasted on bad hair.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product elsewhere, but decided to look on Amazon for it and was surprised by all the negative reviews.  I have thick, wavy hair that either curls beautifully on its own with the humidity or completely frizzes out, which is more common.  If it frizzes, this product does a great job of smoothing it out.  My hair looks healthy and shiny after I use it.  In fact, I just used it mere hours after coloring my hair (with ammonia-free Garnier Olia) and it worked just fine for me. The only negative I have experienced is that it does not last for 7 shampoos, and so I use it only a couple of times per summer as using it more often seems cost-prohibitive. When I don&#x27;t use this product, I wash, comb, apply some sort of anti-frizz product and go.  Perhaps if I colored with an ammonia-based product, used this product more often, or used a heat appliance every day, I would have had different results, but as it stands, I can only recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Giving 5 stars for price &amp; results.&lt;br /&gt;I mainly used this to smooth my hair. My hair is thick, naturally wavy &amp; big in the worst places! I followed the instructions. I washed my hair prior to putting the product in, towel dried it a bit then used the entire bottle, waited 20 minutes. then rinsed it out with cool water. I used the entire bottle of the heat activated cream &amp; comb through it first taking out excess before blow drying with a rotating brush. My hair feels great! I will say, I have an ombre and my natural hair feels a lot better. Some parts of the blonde didn&#x27;t take the product well, but majority of my hair did. I think if you focus a little extra cream on the ends it will help.</li>
    <li> I put in on my hair. It works beautifully. Don&#x27;t know why there are so many complaints. It is exactly what it states it is, I straightens my hair for a much longer that is states it does.</li>
    <li> This stuff is horrible. It completely fried my hair. I have to get it cut short because there is no repairing this type of damage. Bleach does less damage to your hair! I can barely  brush through it, forget about blow drying it. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!</li>
    <li> All of these negative reviews are very suspicious to me.  I have a feeling either people are not following the directions at all, or someone had a bad experience and is launching an attack against this product.  You&#x27;ll notice a lot of the negative reviews use similar or the exact same wording, so.....    Anyway, I used the product about a week ago, and my hair is not damaged AT ALL.  However, it is no miracle product and didn&#x27;t do much to make my hair any different from how it usually is.  The first time straightening it after applying the product took as long as it usually does, and it wasn&#x27;t really anymore \\&quot;sleek\\&quot; looking or anything.  And it does smell pretty bad, but as others have said - similar to a perm or hair color.  After this, I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for two days because I wanted to see if that would help the product \\&quot;set\\&quot; more or something.  It didn&#x27;t really - the next time I washed my hair, I didn&#x27;t straighten it and was hoping that my curls would be a little more relaxed than usual, but the difference was minimal.    The next time I did straighten it, it did seem to be a tiny bit easier than it usually is, but it wasn&#x27;t a big enough difference.  I haven&#x27;t gotten through the seven washes yet, and haven&#x27;t been straightening it - my hair seems to be less poofy than it normally is, so that&#x27;s nice.    So anyway, my hair didn&#x27;t fall out or get damaged, but I don&#x27;t think this is worth the trouble.</li>
    <li> Please add me to the growing list of victims of this hair destroyer! I liked the results for the first 24 hrs. Then I began to notice that I couldn&#x27;t get a brush through my hair, it was really drying out, and big knots and tangles started forming in the back. My hair was (and I say \\&quot;was\\&quot; for a reason) about 3 inches below my shoulders, lengthwise. After pulling out and cutting out knot after knot of tangled up &amp; dried out hair, I went to my hairdresser and had a special condtioner put on($$$) and several inches cut off of my hair. If you see a box of this stuff on the drugstore or grocery store shelf, run like heck in the other direction.DON&#x27;T BUY IT!!</li>
    <li> Actually I was somewhat surprised. It worked fairly well considering the price. I didn&#x27;t have the major damage and dryness others experienced.  My hair felt weird and sticky after the initial rinsing out the product and not being able to apply conditioner...so I was concerned at first.  But then added the serum stuff and blew out then flat ironed.  My ends seemed a little thicker/puffier than usual but I don&#x27;t trim my hair often enough so I didn&#x27;t worry about it much...and just trimmed an 1/8 of an inch off myself as I flat ironed pieces straight.  The product has been great since.  I&#x27;ve done about 5 washes since. Blow dry time was faster for me and flat ironing is faster and easier. I saved the leftover serum to use after other the shampoos but am out now.  My hair is normally very thick and tight curls so this has been great...it keeps it straight and smooth much longer.  I&#x27;m curious how it will be in the humid summer months as it is now winter and very dry.  But maybe the key is getting it really straight with a very hot iron to seal it properly with the right smoothness and then maybe doing a light trim afterwards.  But I haven&#x27;t had any problems and was quite surprised at the issues others have had...I feel lucky.  Prior I wanted to try more professional keratin products but have been scared off due to the price and the formaldehyde issues, etc...so thought this was a safe, easy bet...so far I&#x27;m happy and will be doing a 2nd treatment soon.  I just wish it lasted longer...but no biggee for the price.</li>
    <li> I have curly, but not corse hair. The product did cut down on blow drying time, and it maybe made my hair get a little bit straighter (though it could be that I just paid more attention to blow drying correctly...), but both affects were so slight I just wasn&#x27;t impressed. The effects did last for 7 washes. My hair still started to curl mid-day like it always does when I straighten it. It didn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
    <li> I am SO upset that I used this product. I have put my hair through a lot over the years (dyed black hair to blonde etc) but this product by far is the worst thing that has ever happened to my hair. I regret using this product and wish I had read the reviews first before I did anything. I can&#x27;t even express to you how much of a mistake this **** is. I was hoping that this would help me have nice hair for my wedding in less than two months but instead I think I am going to have to chop off a lot of my hair for it to look nice or somewhat healthy looking for the bigday. As soon as I rinsed out the 20 min serum I could tell that the texture of my hair had drastically changed and possibly melted a bit. I put in the next product in the step in hopes of rescuing my hair but as I brushed it clumps came out and my ends started breaking very easily. I can&#x27;t believe that Garnier would put something like this on the shelves. Do they know that they are ruining peoples&#x27; hair?</li>
    <li> By Cassie from El Paso, TX on 4/21/2011    Hair Type: Wavy HairPros: Easy To Use, Second step smells great, Strong Hold, IT WORKS, Now i LOVE my hair, Controls FrizzCons: First step STINKS, A little heavyBest Uses: Look great all week, Before vacation, Thicker Hair, TravelDescribe Yourself: Beauty ConsciousBottom Line:Yes, I would recommend this to a friend  THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT. IM so glad garnier did this. I read Many reviews before i used this product so i was worried my hair my fall out if i used it. So i tested a lock of hair in the back of my head first and followed the directions. Everything was OK so the next day i used it like this:    put lotion on my forehead, temples, ears, and neck so the stink and harshness would not soak into my skin.  also lotioned my scalp. i dont need straightener there.  put on the gloves.  applied the STEP 1 to my hair avoiding roots and scalp.  left it on 20-25 min.  rinsed it well.  applied STEP 2.  combed it thru.  blow dried and styled.  my hair stayed as styled with body bounce but straight and shiney. NO fly aways NO frizz!!!!  the only improvement i can think of would be to  find a way to make it a little more lightweight.  but i will use it as is for now!  LOVE IT!!    it has a real bad stink.  the stink goes away.  but while working with STEP 1 it is just BAD!  a little more lightweight.</li>
    <li> First of all I have been a pro in the hair industry and I am shocked that these types of products on the market. The active ingredient is cyctein. It is used in perms, straightners, relaxers to some degree. That being said the \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; does the same thing no matter how this company spins how gentle it is. It smells because cystien reacts and smells like Sulfer (rotten egg smell, if you don&#x27;t rinse it out long enough the smell with lock into your hair) It&#x27;s what breaks down your hairs structure. That is why is feels mushy,( Its supposed to) For lack of better word melting the hair so when you put on the second step it neutralized the reaction (re-hardens). Locking in the new straighter smoother structure.     As a pro I have been trained with the chemical and technical knowledge of how to apply chemical product properly. Garnier has no liability to the consumer who does not follow the instructions completely. It states that your hair MUST NOT BE DAMAGED BEFORE you apply it. OR BLEACHED that includes highlights. The chemicals in bleach are not compatible with the product and will cause breakage. Also you must follow the instructions perfectly for application, timing, rinsing. If you mess up anything it will mess up your hair. PERIOD. Honestly, Its not worth messing with your hair like this. Just go get it done if you must. I think this whole Brazilian blow out, Keratin thing is a fad. Do some research online before you apply any chemicals to yourself. Including the ingredients. You may get damaged hair, scalp or allergies for these products. I see countless people who have tried to do colour, straighnter, bleach, themselves and have messed it up as they have no idea how these chemicals actually work.</li>
    <li> Well, I read the reviews and then went out and bought the product.  I following the instructions given by one reviewer who said to apply step 1 of the product in sections and comb through thoroughly.  I left it on for 30 minutes, and rinsed for 10 full minutes making sure to rinse real well.  I then followed the rest of the instructions.  Wow.  My hair turned out great.  It is soft, shiny and STRAIGHT.  I just finished, so I will post again in a few days to update on progress.    My hair is portuguese bushy hair.  It is past my shoulders and is a combination of bushy and wavy and thick and thin in different spots.  Oddly, my hair loves straightening treatments.  I have tried Chi, brazilian blowout and relaxing perms.  My hair loves them all.      With the Garnier treatment, I only used about half of the product.  The other reviewer was right. When you do it in sections and comb it through, you don&#x27;t need as much product.  I think I have enough left over for a second treatment when the time comes.    I&#x27;m not saying that everyone is going to have the results I had.  Everyone&#x27;s hair is different.  But mine turned out great.  I think this product thus far is very underrated.</li>
    <li> I could not believe how bad the smell of Garnier products are! I bought both the Volume-inject Mousse and Wonderwaves and I can&#x27;t use them without gagging. I would not have bought these had I known it smelled like industrial waste.</li>
    <li> This was on special at my local Target (which should have been a warning sign) and I decided I&#x27;d try it. I wish I&#x27;d thought to look up product reviews first! It has dried out my hair, especially the ends, which look fried no matter how long I leave conditioner in. It also lightened my red hair to a weird orange color - not happy! The smell is disgusting (thiol is a sulfur product) and it has left my hair coated in this thick gunk that I can&#x27;t wash off. WORST HAIR PRODUCT I&#x27;ve EVER used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 9/22/2012: I called Garnier a week or so after I used the product to complain. After being passed around a few customer service reps, I ended up with a service manager. I explained what had happened and, to my surprise, she volunteered to pay for restorative treatment and deep conditioner. My reimbursement check came today. I won&#x27;t ever use this product again, and I&#x27;m still leery of Garnier now, but it&#x27;s good to know they will make things right if you ask.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a huge fan of anything Garnier... I have to say how absolutely devastated I am by the damage this has done to my hair. I didn&#x27;t even think go read reviews online because all of the products I&#x27;ve ever used from this company (smoothing milk, sleek and shine, etc) have been top notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just had my hair done a week ago and my brand new hair cut is RUINED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> This product makes me so sad. I used this product in March of 2011. Now, a year and a half later my hair is still destroyed. After this product made my hair  fall out in clumps, I chopped off as much of the damage as I could, in hopes that my hair would grow back strong and healthy. However, the damage was so horrific that I am to this day still dealing with frizzled, dead, brittle hair. I have stick-straight hair that has always been strong and healthy, and no amount of expensive products or salon treatments have helped to bring my hair back to its healthy state. I can&#x27;t even properly describe how damaged my hair STILL is. My hairdresser was horrified when I went to her in tears to ask if she could fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is disappointing to see that a product like this is still on the market shelves - there should really be a class-action lawsuit against Garnier. How this product is still being distributed is beyond me. Please, please believe these reviews and do not buy this product! I wish I could go back in time and read the Amazon reviews before I used it.</li>
    <li> This is the worst hair product ever.  It will ruin your hair.  The damage cannot be reversed and you will have to cut it off.  I&#x27;m not kidding.  I used this product 2 years ago and my hair is just now starting to look decent.  It smells awful.  Your hair will be gummy and broken and your color uneven.  No stars for this evil stuff!  I will never purchase another product from Garnier again!!!</li>
    <li> I cannot believe I see so many negative reviews for this product because I absolutely love it.  No you cannot expect to use this and NEVER have to flat iron again but then when I spent hundreds of dollars on a salon brazillian straightner, not only did I lose hair, I still had to flat iron each and every day to style my hair!  I have naturally wavy hair, not course or curly but still very wavy.  I have found what this product does do for me is it decreases the amount of time a flat iron has to be on my hair, therefore, decreases the damage to my hair.  I have such dry hair from coloring, etc that I only shampoo my hair twice a week so this product will last for me easily a month or longer.  No it&#x27;s not a perfect cure for curly/wavy hair, but then I have not found anthing that is.  It does smell horrible when you apply it, the same smell as a permanent, but that is temporary.  I buy this now on a regular basis at my local Walgreens, often find it on sale and double up when it is on sale.  All I can say is every person will always have their own experience with any product, and you will have to try it for yourself.  The good news is, that for me anyway, my hair has NEVER been damaged from using this, unlike other hair relaxers and straighening products I have used.</li>
    <li> Well, no one will ever read this review with so many already posted, but I just wanted to add my low star rating to make sure the average stays low. This product is extremely damaging. I shoud have known by the smell, like a relaxer, which is what this is really, that it would be bad. Please, do not use this product. It did make my hair nice and straight and smooth for a few days after using. Then, after the next shampoo, the damage was clear. Horrible, horrible product! I wish Amazon didn&#x27;t make us give at least one star because this product deserves none.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product. It will ruin your hair. It does not make it shiny or sleek or frizz free - it damages your hair and will make it fall out.  I have been growing my hair out for 5 years to donate and bought this product to help with frizz and cut back on blow dry time.   The product smells terrible and when you rinse it out, it feels like your hair is straw. I had just gotten a hair cut and had zero split ends, now my ends are all split and my hair is breaking like crazy.   I filed a complaint with the BBB, it is irresponsible for Garnier to keep this product on the shelf.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read the reviews before destroying my hair with this product. I recently had a cut and the stylist had recommended a Keratin treatment to help keep a smooth blowdried look. I bought this product after reading it was safe for color treated hair. I was concerned as soon as I applied it because it smelled like a perm which I would never apply to my processed hair. I rinsed if out after 15 minutes instead of 20. I knew I was in trouble as soon as I pulled the towel off. My hair was gummy, overprocessed and lighter. Do not be fooled, this does not wash out after 7 shampoos like some sort of silicone treatment. It is harsh chemicals that destroy hair. You will have to cut your hair off.   I just filed a BBB complaint. L&#x27;Oreal only has 8 complaints for the past 3 years. If you want something done about this, you&#x27;ll need to do more than post bad reviews on Amazon.  This product needs to be pulled off shelves NOW!  UPDATE: It has now been 2 weeks since I destroyed my hair with this product. I put shea butter in my hair for 2 days and that did nothing. I then went to a salon and had a $70 hot oil treatment but they said nothing can be done to save the hair and it all has to be cut off. The more it washes out, the more damage you will see. I now have a head full of hair that looks like pipe cleaners. It is so weak that it breaks off when I touch it.  I did hear from L&#x27;Oreal as per my BBB complaint. They refunded 11.99 of the 12.99 plus tax I paid for it and offerred to pay for the deep conditioning treatment which did not help.</li>
    <li> Okay ladies, I used this Blow Dry mess about a week ago, and had the same damage experience many of you describe in your reviews.  Because I remembered that the product box or insert said that it works by altering protein in hair structure and because the texture of my hair felt like the product had left the cuticle of each hair strand open or partially open, I got the idea to try Color Essentials Allerga Natural Keratine treatment on it.  This is a protein treatment that says that it works while the cuticle is open (to be used while coloring, bleaching or perming the hair).  Since Garnier&#x27;s Blow Dry product smells and acts like a reverse perm, I thought this fix might work.  So, I took two pkgs for my medium long hair (almost to upper waist area) and drenched my hair with them.  Then, I added a polisher in order to more easily brush through.  I brushed all this carefully through for even distribution, put my hair in a loose ponytail and left it until night.  I took out the ponytail so as to not pull my hair during the night.  (You should never sleep in a ponytail...especially if you have curly hair which is the most delicate hair type.  This is because it pulls and breaks off hair during the night.  Over time, you will end up with layers you never meant to have.)  My hair is fairly thick and still wasn&#x27;t dry by evening from all the treatment I had put on it.  In the morning, the texture of my hair was almost back to normal after one treatment!!  Mind you, I still have broken hairs from this terrible Blow Dry stuff.  The treatment can&#x27;t fix that, but it does appear to be normalizing texture VERY QUICKLY compared to anything else I have tried or have read about on this site.&lt;br /&gt;You can find the Allerga treatment online.  I don&#x27;t know where to get it in stores, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s available.  I get mine from hello-gorgeous.net for $1.75 per package.  I will continue to to use the protein treatment for the next little while in order to make sure I don&#x27;t lose any groundwith the texture improvement.  But I am very encouraged at the immediate results.  Truly, my hair texture is almost normal again.  Please comment on my review and let me know if it works for you too.  I would love to be able to help all of the unhappy women on this product site (or coming to this site in the future) correct their sad hair as quickly as possible.  It&#x27;s an easy and inexpensive repair.  Best of luck!!&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have washed my hair after my \\&quot;fix it\\&quot; treatment, not using shampoo, just rinsing conditioner through it.  I did find that I lost some of my improved texture again.  Not nearly as bad as before, though.  I put more of Allerga&#x27;s product on and brushed through.  I am thinking that a cuticle restoration product would help close the cuticle and keep the Allerga product within the cuticle better.  I am looking at one on Amazon that has rave reviews.  Senscience CPR Cuticle Porosity Reconstructor.  Found the 2 item set for a cheaper price on sleekhair.com.  I&#x27;ll update my review on how it works.  This one is pricey.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry! NOTHING I have tried could repair the damage this caused.  One year later, I can hold out a handful of hair and see the exact point of growth I had when I put this terrible stuff on my hair. From that area to the ends (which I have continually been cutting several inches off at a time in order to remove damage) there is a sudden decrease in volume of hair by almost half!  This product truly broke off much of my hair. Additionally, although the product description says the change to your hair is temporary, and will wear off after several weeks, one year later, the hair I used this on has a very different curl appearance and texture...NOT pretty!</li>
    <li> This past weekend I was sick. Really sick. Like head-on-the-bathroom-tiles, wish-I-was-dead-because-dead-people-can&#x27;t-puke sick. So Monday morning, when I finally felt better enough to not cry at the concept of eating a water cracker, I decided to perk myself up and beautify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily (although later it would turn out to be UNLUCKILY, like cursed-for-100 years-after-breaking-77-mirrors-and-crossing-paths-with-1,000-black-cats-while-walking-under-endless-ladders unluckily), I had purchased a product that promised a \\&quot;perfect blow dry.\\&quot; The vials of \\&quot;Garnier Fructis Style Sleek &amp; Shine Blow Dry Perfector\\&quot; were sitting on my shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had left them there. Instead, I put on the plastic gloves, which really should have been the first red flag -- what kind of hair sleek-ening product promises such silky softness and sensual smoothness that it requires you to protect your hands from it? Did I take the hint and run the other way like I should have?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blame the virus I just battled, or maybe blame the fact that I&#x27;ve been programmed to accept and submit to preposterous products and processes in the name of \\&quot;beauty.\\&quot; A stranger seeing my butthole before ripping out its innocent protective hairs? Yeah, sounds okay. Strapping talons to my feet? No prob! I even have friends who wear suffocating Spanx every day \\&quot;because I feel more, well, me!\\&quot; What?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I read the instructions, which include a disclaimer along the lines of \\&quot;it&#x27;s natural for this product to have an odor.\\&quot; I highlight my hair (another concession to beauty at the price of health and sanity -- put a zillion chemicals near my brain? Okay!) and I figured I&#x27;m used to the smell of hair products. No prob, I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the vial of serum (it&#x27;s a two-step process: serum and then some other goo). Words cannot describe. But for you, I&#x27;ll try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was like being slapped by an egg salad as it sat, vomiting, on a turd. It was like being hugged by a sea-cucumber excreting maggots who were each suffering from dysentery. It was like dying, then having your corpse worn as a corpse-hat by a haberdasher who&#x27;s into that sort of thing, then having him die, and his corpse-hat-corpse being worn as a hat by his apprentice who takes over the millinery shop. It was like gout. It was like Bambi&#x27;s mother&#x27;s death. And then her zombie. Snacking on that skunk Flower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so, I put it all over my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY DID I DO THIS? I don&#x27;t know! Wait, I do know! Because of the above-mentioned insanity of thinking femininity somehow requires suffering, pain, and horrible, fetid, noxious smells. My best friend just revealed to me that she&#x27;s gotten needles of Botox in her crows feet at 31. Crows feet she got from a teenhood addiction to tanning beds. Pain on pain, and potentially, even deeper pain from cancerous disease and disaster. But boy do the corners of her eyes look like a baby&#x27;s bottom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one point, my cat came into the bathroom, where I was standing with a towel draped around my neck, because the package advised that I might not want to let this stuff touch my skin. (Another red flag I insanely did not recognize.) Mind you, he&#x27;s a vocal cat, and sensitive to smells -- like when he smells salad dressing, his blue eyes close up like he&#x27;s a furry little feline stoner -- but he shot out of the bathroom yowling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yowling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon, I would be too. As I dipped into the shower after sitting for 20 minutes with the stuff -- because, I figured, once I had this regurgitated-egg-yolk, fish feces, goat entrails potion on my head, I might as well grit and bear it for the recommended time -- I touched, at last, my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It felt like the sun bleached hayfields of a Monet painting. It felt like the Brillo pad that&#x27;s been crusting and rusting to the edge of my sink. It felt like Garth Algar&#x27;s coif after a trip through the Serengeti. It felt like pain. No, wrath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actuallyscreamed \\&quot;What have I done?\\&quot; to no one, while bent over the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed it out again, and still my head stank. I opened the windows. I moaned like Ludo in Labyrinth, my favorite movie, when he gets sent to the Bog of Eternal Stench and has to step over the rocks that jut up out of the murk, and every time he treads on one it emits wild, popping farts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only the bog was my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the Garnier website, there are a number of positive reviews for this product, presumably from people who a) hate themselves, b) hate other people, c) are insane, d) cannot smell, e) cannot feel texture, or f) all of the above, in which case, I really do forgive them for writing those reviews, because that sounds like a tough life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But below the handful of positive reviews from insane-os are scores of real reviews. A sampling:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  SaraW: \\&quot;The instructions warn there will be an odor but the smell was so much worse than I ever thought it would be.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;  Maki418: \\&quot;The smell is horrible and it will not go away. I&#x27;ve washed my hair over and over and it still smells. Now my hair is like rubber.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;  KimMie88: \\&quot;It smells so bad my husband had to leave the house.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;  KimV: \\&quot;The only way I can describe it is like if you put NAIR on it and washed it out before it completely melted it\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;  MAD1: \\&quot;can&#x27;t even comb my hair it looks like and old piece of carpet!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s on the company website! Amazon has more horror stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I sprayed a billion spritzes of perfume into my hair while I styled it with a blowdyer and a straightening iron, and in the end it looked exactly like it always does after I blow-dry and straighten it, with the main difference being that it feels one zillion times worse and smells like death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To top if off, my eyes sting from where I spritzed them (the instructions say to go to the hospital if you get it in your eyes, FYI, but the funny thing is that your hair is right next to your eyes), and I now have old woman fingers where I accidentally got some on me. Like crone-style, which kind of matches my odor, so at least I have consistency going for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I a victim of my own vanity? Hells yes. But are the people at Garnier at least partially responsible for marketing a product like this to women under such a fuzzy name as \\&quot;blow-dry perfector\\&quot; rather than the chemical slop of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  water, Cysteine, Ethanolamine*, PEG-14 Dimethicone, Hexadimethrine Chloride, Aminomethyl Propanol, Polysorbate 20, Oleth-20, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Hydroxypropyl Guar, Cetrimonium Chloride, Dimethicone PEG-7 Phosphate, Parfum/Fragrance, Pentasodium Pentetate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(*Ethanolamine, by the by, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States Department of Labor, causes \\&quot;central nervous system depression in exposed animals\\&quot; at certain levels, and don&#x27;t even get me started on Hexadimethrine Chloride.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a more appropriate point of blame would be assenting to the notion held by many -- myself included -- that beauty is pain, pain beauty. (Note they never say that about \\&quot;handsomeness.\\&quot;) That concept is what allowed this disgusting product to exist, and what made me slather it on my head. Even my already brutalized stomach flipped and flopped a resounding \\&quot;don&#x27;t do it! Please dear God don&#x27;t do it!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair -- and the colleagues who sit by my cubicle and have been hit by its wafting stench with the ferocity of a cartoon hand symbolizing \\&quot;stink\\&quot; every few minutes -- are the worse for this morning&#x27;s mistake. But I think, maybe, I&#x27;m for the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]ank. I opened the windows. I moaned like Ludo in Labyrinth, my favorite movie, when he gets sent to the Bog of Eternal Stench and has to step over the rocks that jut up out of the murk, and every time he treads on one it emits wild, popping farts.    Only the bog was my hair.    On the Garnier website, there are a number of positive reviews for this product, presumably from people who a) hate themselves, b) hate other people, c) are insane, d) cannot smell, e) cannot feel texture, or f) all of the above, in which case, I really do forgive them for writing those reviews, because that sounds like a tough life.

To top if off, my eyes sting from where I spritzed them (the instructions say to go to the hospital if you get it in your eyes, FYI, but the funny thing is that your hair is right next to your eyes), and I now have old woman fingers where I accidentally got some on me. Like crone-style, which kind of matches my odor, so at least I have consistency going for me.    Am I a victim of my own vanity? Hells yes. But are the people at Garnier at least partially responsible for marketing a product like this to women under such a fuzzy name as \\&quot;blow-dry perfector\\&quot; rather than the chemical slop of      water, Cysteine, Ethanolamine*, PEG-14 Dimethicone, Hexadimethrine Chloride, Aminomethyl Propanol, Polysorbate 20, Oleth-20, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Hydroxypropyl Guar, Cetrimonium Chloride, Dimethicone PEG-7 Phosphate, Parfum/Fragrance, Pentasodium Pentetate.    (*Ethanolamine, by the by, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States Department of Labor, causes \\&quot;central nervous system depression in exposed animals\\&quot; at certain levels, and don&#x27;t even get me started on Hexadimethrine Chloride.)    But a more appropriate point of blame would be assenting to the notion held by many -- myself included -- that beauty is pain, pain beauty. (Note they never say that about \\&quot;handsomeness.\\&quot;) That concept is what allowed this disgusting product to exist, and what made me slather it on my head. Even my already brutalized stomach flipped and flopped a resounding \\&quot;don&#x27;t do it! Please dear God don&#x27;t do it!\\&quot;    My hair -- and the colleagues who sit by my cubicle and have been hit by its wafting stench with the ferocity of a cartoon hand symbolizing \\&quot;stink\\&quot; every few minutes -- are the worse for this morning&#x27;s mistake. But I think, maybe, I&#x27;m for the better.    [...]</li>
    <li> Got my kits without a hitch.  Works great as usual! and my kinky. curly, frizzy, hair is now managable, and it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;poof&#x27; and curl by the end of the day anymore due to the humidity of summer.</li>
    <li> I have destroyed my hair it won&#x27;t stop breaking of can&#x27;t brush it its all melted ruined. Why are they allowed to keep this on the shelf.</li>
    <li> I figured out this product.  This is a relaxer.  Look up the main ingredient Cysteine and you will see it contains sulfur.  It is part of the Thiol group.  So what you are experiencing is the chemical break down of your hair.  The effect would be less if there were a neutralizer as a product sold as a relaxer does.  However not only are you putting a chemical that breaks down the bond of your hair without neutralization, but then you apply heat to it another process that breaks the chemical bond of your hair.  This is negligent at best because it is a chemical that is not regulated...relaxers.  The &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; community has been subjected to these damaging products and no one regulates them.  I doubt anyone ever will regulate it because they make too much money.  It now has crossed over into an industry that promotes &amp;#34;managing&amp;#34; curly hair and relentless advertising to straighten hair.  Two solutions for those with damage.  Cut off the ends and apply raw shea butter.  Buy some shea butter from an African food store.  Shea butter has healing properties.  Also for the hair broken at the root continue to apply the shea butter and trim it as is grows out.  Be patient.  Your hair will grow back.  A second solution for the brave would be to shave your head or buzz cut it and wear a wig.  This would be faster in that it would get rid of all the chemical damage.  This is what women in the Natural Hair Movement have been doing.  My African sisters and/or curly hair sisters have been doing this to return to natural after relaxing their hair for years (decades).  Peace!</li>
    <li> MOST DEFINITELY NOT SLEEK AND SMOOTH!!! I AM SO FURIOUS RIGHT NOW.. it fried my hair.. and on here it says dont use on colored hair but according to the package after 2 weeks you can.. SO I waited a month and its still fried.. awesome... NOT. I have been trying to take care of my hair and was getting to a point where it was manageable and when I was drying it, it felt sticky, as well as pulled out A LOT MORE HAIR THAN NORMAL COMBING.. The picture on the front of the box is obviously false advertising and someone who didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I am currently 14 years old, and I have really healthy hair. That is because I have only switched to Suave and Nexxus products only. I have literally tried EVERY Garnier Fructis hair care product on the market today, from their Sleek and Shine line, Body Boost, Length and Strength, Daily Care, Fall Fight, Moisture Works, Triple Nutrition, Hydra Recharge, and all of their other products such as their hair serums, hairsprays, mousses etc....yep, you name it, Iv&#x27;e tried it. All of my attempts to try Garnier products have all resulted in greasy, grimy, dull, flat, and damaged messes, that, thankfully, I was able to fix without trouble. When I saw this \\&quot;Sleek and Shine Blow Dry Perfector\\&quot;, on television, and in my Seventeen magazine, I decided to give the Garnier company another chance to prove itself useful. This was the most stupidest,  and unnecessary decision that I have ever made in my life. Perfector??..haha!..you must work for the company iself, as this was FAR from perfection. Number one, the serum and cream in this set smells like a burnt rubber car tire that has skidded on the ground....oh my god, even my dog ran out of the bathroom, because, she happily wanted to observe what I was up to, but, then caught a whiff of that....stuff, and hightailed it out of there at full breakneck speed. This made my normally straight, thick hair a frizzy, matted, horrid, tangled mess. It actually looked like I got struck by a huge lightning bolt. Even worse, the next day, I had to go to school! The kids in my class threw snooty remarks and taunts at me the whole school day. Here is what my best friend said to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Using Garnier again, I see.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I know...I tried that Sleek Blow Dry Perfector Kit thing...\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;You WHAT?!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Yes, yes, I did.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;What sick, twisted soul made you try that?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The crummy infomercial on TV\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;You are so gullable, It amazes me\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Please, don&#x27;t remind me...\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me A WEEK AND A HALF to get my hair back into its normal, healthy state again. It only took what...seven deep conditioning treatments, two oil treatments, and three visits to my hairstylist during that time to repair my hair. And, the worse part is, that, I did a little research on this product, and I am not the only person that had this problem. Here are some reviews from Makeupalley.com:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; christinaking on 9/2/2012 6:49:00 PM More reviews by christinaking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Age: 36-43 Skin: Acne-prone, Tan, Cool Hair: Brown, Straight, Medium Eyes: Brown&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is def the worst product I have ever used! It is funny how some reviewers are repeating what the box states...It says to wait 2 weeks after coloring your hair, then elsewhere it says that if your hair is treated in any way, to not use it! It does no good to repeat the same bs twice, it doesn&#x27;t make sense the 2nd time either.&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my hair a few months ago which happened to be just before my wedding. For the first time ever, the ends of my hair were just breaking off. I would brush my hair and have all these short pieces of hair all over my clothes....and this is still happening, even after a trim. My hair became dry and thin as well. Now it is almost back to normal but the people producing this stuff should spend more energy on taking it off the market and less on writing phoney reviews that just sound ridiculous....ps: it does not make it more believable to write \\&quot;like\\&quot; in a review to make it sound as if as 18 year old wrote it. Like, you know what I mean??&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 out of 1 people found this review helpful.

My hair completely changed after using this product. I tried so many treatments for a few weeks to try to restore my hair but nothing worked. So yesterday I had to get 7 inches cut off because of what this product did to my hair! I am completely disappointed with Garnier and I will honestly think TWICE before I buy another product of theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 out of 3 people found this review helpful.

Did this treatment a year ago and completely ruined the ends of my hair, turned the ends into a frizzy kinky mess that I couldn&#x27;t even get to straighten and look normal. My ends began to fall off.. I was forced to cut a few inches off my hair that was already shoulder length.. My hair is still not the same.. I regret using this so much..

DO NOT USE! I used it before reading reviews and it made my beautiful, thick, long hair extremely dry and thin/stringy. I had to cut some of it off and use a lot of repair treatments in the salon and at home. It&#x27;s been a year and a half and my hair is still not the same. I can&#x27;t wait for all of it to grow out. This product really needs to be taken off the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 out of 5 people found this review helpful.

With as bad as all of these are, I&#x27;m sooooooo glad I read the reviews first.

DO NOT BUY THIS!&lt;br /&gt;I started out really excited to use the product. If you read the box it sounds like it would be perfect for someone who has thick wavy frizzy hair like myself. I opened up the package and put in the 20 min smooth it serum, it smelled horrible. it made my whole bathroom and parts of my other house reek. After i opened it and smelled it, i should have stopped myself but the directions stated that it was going to smell. Then i waited the 20 minutes and put in the heat activated perfect it cream and i thought well at least it smells better and i was happy again. Then I started to blow dry it, my hair felt horrible. It wasn&#x27;t smooth or silky like they said it was going to be. It was kind of ruff and it still smelled. I ended up just finishing it and then i straightened it with a flat iron. It still smelled and I was not happy. I did this all last night, this morning I washed my hair today and it still smells. I can&#x27;t wait for these 7 washes to happen ASAP! Total waste of money and my time. I should have came on a website and read reviews. It seems everyone is hating it. They need to take it off the shelves. My hair wasn&#x27;t ruined, at least not yet &#x3D;/ I hope everyone who reads this, I change there minds about buying this. Just using good shampoo and conditioner and a hair protection serum is the best. I am never trying another product like this. I just bought this because i thought it would be more manageable for my hair and i wouldn&#x27;t have to spend over an hour doing my hair. This product is crap.&lt;br /&gt;JUST DONT BUY IT! SAVE YOUR MONEY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hahaha! Smoothing kit??..More like Frizzing kit!&lt;br /&gt;Please, I beg you, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.

    <li> Nothing to do w the packaging or time of arrival,  which btw was great! I have really thick hair and this product didn&#x27;t really help me. Next time I&#x27;ll have to spend the extra money to get what I need.</li>
    <li> Just bought this product on sale, didn&#x27;t read the reviews until after using it but I loved it. Made my unmanagable hair great! I&#x27;m not sure why so many negative reviews, other than possibly blow drying time or they didn&#x27;t read all of the warnings on the side to not use for certain types. I loved it though would def. give it a try!</li>
    <li> My hair started breaking off and falling out. Do not use this product. It is awful. I couldn&#x27;t even comb through my hair. It felt like elastic.</li>
    <li> Once you return this product you will never receive your refund-I have been working on this for months and they confirm receipt of the return and have never issued a credit-beware this entire organization is a skam! Do not buy it does not work in any regard and the company and 7 of their representatives have told me I would receive a credit and nothing, after each call. The agents all claim they will take care of it and don&#x27;t. Each time I&#x27;m assured the credit has taken place and each time it hasn&#x27;t-so frustratrating.</li>
    <li> This is easily the worst smelling hair product I have ever had the misfortune of using. The instruction say that the product will smell as it has active ingredients... but the instructions do not prepare you for being hit by a school bus filled with quickly rotting garbage. I hoped the smell would leave after I rinsed my hair (it did not). The smell lingered for hours, it gave me a headache, I thought I was going to vomit. I couldn&#x27;t take anymore of the smell (or the straw like feeling that my hair had adopted after using this product) and washed and conditioned my hair as usual. I let my hair air dry and used coconut oil to return it&#x27;s usual shine.&lt;br /&gt;I put this Garnier product in my hair hoping that it would look less frizzy when I bike to and from work on hot days but I will never find out... I&#x27;ll just tie my hair in a braid and spare myself the retching. Blow dry perfection and sleek frizz-free hair be damned! DO NOT USE IF YOU VALUE YOUR HAIR OR YOUR SENSE OF SMELL!!!!</li>
    <li> just like everyone else giving this product high ratings, I&#x27;m sad to hear so many negative experiences with this product. bought it at longs drugstore on a whim and a few nights later I used it. yeah, the serum smells bad, someone else said sulfur and that is exactly how I would describe it too. lol. so I just worked quickly to get it all in my hair. as I was waiting the 20 min I started to read the reviews and I almost cried. the positive ones were very reassuring though, I could tell they weren&#x27;t people that were working for garnier or anything. (maybe im a bit paranoid lol) :p rinsed very thoroughly and wrapped it in a towel for a little while. it took me quite a while to dry and straighten it but I was also really taking my time. I did small sections at a time and was very controlled with the blow dryer (not just shaking it around) my hair feels wonderful. the results are similar to a brazillian blowout, more or less, but for that price, you gotta atleast try it. my hair has very little damage to begin with (just a little frizzy and wavy) and the last time I had colored it was about a year ago and I dyed it black (my hair is naturally dark brown anyway so you can hardly see the difference when it grows in) and that was a little less then a year ago. the strands feel sealed and thicker/stronger than normal and it is very shiny. for this price I know I will get this again. if the product doesn&#x27;t work for you it&#x27;s not because the product itself is bad, it just simply doesn&#x27;t suit all hair types. I do think that the company should put a disclaimer on the box or instructions and mention the hair types that get the best results so you can make a more informed choice. if you want to give it a try, I say go for it. if you are really nervous about it, try a strand test. if you are lucky enough to have it work for you then it will work wonderfully. :) I also put a little argon oil in it after and yeah, I&#x27;m really greatful for this product :)</li>
    <li> So my boyfriend bought me this on his military base after I pointed it out in a magazine a while back. I decided to do it tonight so my hair would be silky and amazing when he comes home from annual training on Saturday. So as I was sitting with the stinky stuff in my hair and my four year old was telling me it smelled like gas, I started looking up reviews. Then. I.  Panicked. Ran into the bathroom and rinsed it out all while having a mild panic attack envisioning myself with broken dead hair. My hair is already dry and not shiny....what did I do?! I should have left it curly! Or so I thought. My hair came out AWESOME. It&#x27;s straight (normally huge and curly and frizzy) and shiny. I almost lost my mind after reading the reviews, I&#x27;m glad I gave it a shot. By the way, i work for a bank, not Garnier or any affiliated business. I just thought I would save some other poor sap the trouble of having palpitations while reading. Don&#x27;t use it if you have highlights I think. That seems to be a common trend in the reviews.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in the close out section. That should have been my first indication that something might be wrong  Unfortunately, the desire to have soft, straight hair at a discount price took over.  Big Mistake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been 4 days and my hair is so brittle and damaged I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever get it back to normal.  Not only did it fry my hair, but it also stripped it of the color. I&#x27;m so disappointed and embarrassed of my appearance right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only I had read the reviews first. I&#x27;m going to try to condition my hair over night with Infusium and pray it helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garnier should be ashamed of themselves for destroying the lives of so many!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this item not realizing it was a chemical hair treatment. I thought it was styling products. The box doesn&#x27;t really give you a good indication of what it is. After reading all of the reviews, this product went directly to my trash can. Thank you to all the ladies who posted reviews for saving my hair!</li>
    <li> This is possibly the worst product my wife EVER USED!  I will let her describe.  We bought this product for me and my daughter who was away at college. My hair is dry and medium golden brown.  I read the box in the store and it sounded so good.  7 washes and it promises that your hair will dry faster and smoother and is also acceptable for flat-iron use. The first and only time I used it, following the directions exactly it did dry faster but when I looked up into the mirror to my horror my hair was an now a really ugly red on the top and where I had just got highlights in.  I couldn&#x27;&#x27;t believe my eyes!  No where in the instructions or on the box does it say that it will change your hair color.  The other box I was going to send to my daughter and I threw it away even though her hair is a very blonde.  It promises so much but delivers nothing!  Even the second time I washed it, nothing had changed.  It wasn&#x27;t smooth, even with a straight iron which usually smooths it.  I don&#x27;t use a straight iron often, just when its really humid out.  My daughter lives in Charleston, SC and it&#x27;s humid there all the time. If you look on the Garnier website, they don&#x27;t even sell it anymore!  Don&#x27;t buy it here or anywhere.  If it sounds to good to be true, it probably isn&#x27;t. When I called the company they said that that could happen but it doesn&#x27;t say anything on the box. They said if you have a little red in your hair it could happen.</li>
    <li> This product just ruined my hair. I take really good care of my hair. I have curly hair and usually can straighten it to look very nice. Not this time! This product left it with a horrible texture that made it almost impossible to comb it. My hair started to fall off. I will have to cut off several inches to make it look semi presentable.</li>
    <li> This product is advertised as a seven day blow dry treatment, but it actually contains irreversible harsh chemicals. It smelled like rotten eggs (which should have been a clue for me to throw it away) that permeated the entire house. It was so bad my boyfriend actually threw up and had to leave.&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t the worst part, though. The aftermath is. My hair actually melted and got extremely kinky. The individual strands look like they were stretched and are bunched up into a thin, frizzy mess. My hair had a slight wave prior to the treatment, but now what is left of the hair is a fried mess.&lt;br /&gt;It is damaged from root to tip (half way down my back). My only hope for avoiding a buzz cut is to wear it in a bun until it grows a few inches and I can get a pixie cut (NOT what I want), as every restoring product I have tried has failed to this point.&lt;br /&gt;A final note - even with my hair being extremely dry and damaged, it is not easier to blow dry, and actually takes longer.&lt;br /&gt;This product is horrific and has ruined my hair and caused me a lot of anguish. Please do yourself a favor and use anything else but this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update 3/13/13: Garnier did send me a reimbursement check for a haircut and deep conditioning treatment. For that, I am grateful. However, it is a few months later, and my hair is still a frizzy mess if I don&#x27;t ever-so-carefully blow dry it with a lot of Keratin or Moroccan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update 8/21/13: Hair is still breaking and falling out in the places I haven&#x27;t been able to cut off yet. Talk about long term damage.</li>
    <li> Pros:Works as promised, leaves hair shiny, resists humidity.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:Only lasted 2 days for me and smelled quite strong of sulphur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very damaged hair.  My hair is also color treated so dry, dull, frizziness is real problem for me.  Desperate for some shine I have tried many, many products usually ending in disappointment but it was quite different when I purchased Garneir Sleek &amp; Shine Blow Dry Perfector for about $11.99 from a local pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in a package with two tubes, gloves for application and easy to follow instructions.  Basically how it works is first, wash your hair but don&#x27;t apply any conditioner.  Use the gloves provided and apply tube #1 which is a &amp;#34;20 minute Smooth-It Serum&amp;#34;, and keep hair as straight as you can while it&#x27;s processing.  The product in this tube smells like sulphur to a pretty profound degree, enough to be bothersome for some people I am sure, however, you need not worry, you won&#x27;t smell it in your hair after completion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next you are going to rinse the 20 minute Smooth-It Serum with warm water and apply tube #2 &amp;#34;Heat Activated Perfect-It Cream&amp;#34; which acts as a sort of sealer.  This application doesn&#x27;t get rinsed out, it stays in, you then blow dry and flat iron and you&#x27;re done!  This tube has a pleasant scent to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you follow these steps to completion be prepared to love your hair!  Your hair will feel so soft and wonderful and even my extremely damaged and frizzy hair was super shiny and pretty after using this product, an effect I haven&#x27;t achieved with anything else I&#x27;ve tried so far.  I would like to advise that the directions do state not to use this product if your hair is damaged, but I went out on a limb and tried it anyway. You may want to use caution and your own judgement at whether or not you want to take that chance.  It didn&#x27;t cause me any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product states that your hair will resist humidity and stay shiny for up to 7 days but in my experience I had super shiny, soft hair that resisted humidity for only 2 days making it a bit expensive for me for such a short term effect.  The way I see it is, it&#x27;s perfect if you have a very special occasion coming up or as a special treat but I don&#x27;t personally use it on a regular basis.  I&#x27;d like to add that I live in Florida where the humidity is always high and frizz is a problem and Garnier Sleek &amp; Shine Blow Dry Perfector blocked out even the Florida humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try and enjoy a couple days away from frizz!!ys but in my experience I had super shiny, soft hair that resisted humidity for only 2 days making it a bit expensive for me for such a short term effect.

    <li> I also agree with all the other reviews,  this is not good for your hair, my hair is now damanage and I have to go in to get it cut and get a salon deep conditioner.  I could not even get a comb through my hair and it has no body or texture at all, this stuff has stripped it all out and it smells like a perm. Don&#x27;t use it</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product because what woman out there doesn&#x27;t like the sound of something that is going to take away from the time spent getting ready, am I right? Unfortunately, this was a terrible idea. I had recently colored my hair a dark burgundy and was in love with the color and the way that my hair was looking, but my local Walmart had the blow dry perfecter on sell and I  just had to try it. I eagerly went home and opened the box up and began to read the instructions. I was a little thrown off by the fact that you had to wear gloves to put this on your hair and that there was, as the booklet stated, \\&quot;an odor\\&quot; that was more like a stench than anything. I ended up shrugging off these thoughts as I began to imagine not having to re-straighten my hair regularly and applied the first tube to my hair. Twenty minutes later I rinsed it out, while doing so I noticed color was washing out of my hair as well, but I told myself it was only because I had recently colored my hair and it was no big deal so I applied the second tube and I thought everything was just fine. After everything was in I blow dried my hair only to find small pieces of my hair breaking off in the major side bang area of my hair as I brushed it out. This scared the life out of me. I finished it only to find my hair completely fried and the ends. Not only that, my hair color has almost completely left my hair in the area it was fried in, so I don&#x27;t only have crispy ends, but it is also multicolored and ridiculous and since my hair is in such bad shape I cannot color it again in fear of causing more damage or it simply washing out as it did before. I would never recommend this product to anyone I liked. It is terrible and will do little to nothing for you besides ruin your hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this on sale at a local pharmacy chain. I am African American, but have a long history of exotic mixes. If you look at the back of the box, it says if your hair looks like \\&quot;this\\&quot; , then use the product. Well, my hair looked like that so I tried it. Let me say the smell is horrible, but I have smelled worse in salons. After carefully following the directions, I blow dried my hair and was amazed at how beautiful it was with just the blow drying. I normally have about an hour of straightening with a curling iron to get my hair to look that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this product isn&#x27;t for everyone but it worked beautifully for me. I am on my seventh wash and it is still working off of the first treatment. I did not use all of the treatment from the first use, so I am looking forward to another seven weeks after I do it today.</li>
    <li> Luckily, this product left no visible signs of damage to my hair- but I have also not noticed any sort of change at all.</li>
    <li> This really gets your hair straight and easy to blow dry for weeks!</li>
    <li> After reading all of the reviews posted here, I was so scared to use this product. By the time I read the reviews it was too late; I had already applied the serum to my hair and was waiting for it to process. Thankfully, I was very surprised by the results. After blowing out my hair, it was smooth and shiny. I could not stop running my hands through my hair, it was so soft! The blowdry was also super fast and easy. It only took one or two runs of the blowdryer through each section for it to dry. I&#x27;m so happy with the results and will definitely use it again. The only reason why I did not give 5 stars is because I have not tested it in the rain or humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that I did not leave the serum on for 20 min as instructed. I left it in for 17 min. Also, I did not use all of the serum provided. I have naturally wavy shoulder length hair. In order to keep it straight, I have to blowout my hair daily. Normally, I do not need to flat iron my hair.</li>
