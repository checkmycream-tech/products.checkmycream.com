      <li>My hair is soft..shiny...and best twistout yet!!</li>
      <li>This product has great slip!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!!!</li>
      <li>and it smells really great.</li>
      <li>but it smells great</li>
      <li>I think it may not be good for my type of curls</li>
      <li>It did give me good curl definition and moisture.</li>
      <li>After using this product, my hair felt great and was easy to style.  </li>
      <li>I would maybe use this stuff for cream to put my hair up in a bun or some kind of updo.</li>
      <li>my curls is gorgeous ,love this product</li>
      <li>It has a nice affect on my hair and smells really good  :-).</li>
      <li>So, like I said, it&#x27;s good for updos, but since I already have a moisturizer that I like better</li>
      <li>It smells delicious, works very well.</li>
      <li>use it when performing a twist out - awesome product, provides curls and not hard on hair or to touch.</li>
      <li>And I like to try new products for curls in my hair to see what works best.</li>
      <li>After all the hype and you tube reviews I as expecting a better outcome on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
      <li>My twist outs are phenomenal as well...</li>
      <li>I like this curl cream better than....</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>But I like it better than Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl Enhancing Smoothie.</li>
      <li>this has to be my favorite by far!!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s allowed my hair to be more manageable</li>
      <li>I get nice frizz free</li>
      <li>I have tried many many hair care products for my curly hair-</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fine for my hair to be a bit exotic, but this was just unprofessional.)</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t foresee this ever becoming my go-to product.</li>
      <li>I have read that shrinkage is primarily caused by the texture of your hair, so that is something else to consider.</li>
      <li>stays all day, gives my curl definition, lift, and a smooth look.  </li>
      <li>I used it on wet and blown out hair to creat a beautiful twist out.</li>
      <li>great for natural drying or diffuse drying-I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>and when I used this product directly after co-washing my hair, the back of my hair (4a) exhibited shrinkage to my neck (yes, that many inches!!!).</li>
      <li>/&gt;First, the smell is sickly sweet, like cake or pastries.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it in my sons&#x27; very short hair and it&#x27;s definitely made a difference when I brush their hair each morning before school besides the very delicious scent.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s perfect for my my short curly hair,I always work it in wet hair</li>
      <li>Its my new holy grail!!!</li>
      <li>The souffle did exactly what it said it would do.</li>
      <li>, I most likely won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
      <li>I experience most shrinkage in the back of my hair that is 4a.</li>
      <li>It smells fabulous, made of natural ingredients</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t mind it that much.</li>
      <li>This product did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
      <li>I applied it to my damp hair and my hair became very sticky, which I did not like at all.</li>
      <li>I lucked upon this product when I first went natural and have used it since.</li>
      <li>Was hesitant to buy it because I thought it would be like the kinky curly product but was pleasantly surprised to see that it had POSITIVE results on my hair.</li>
      <li>I would have been MUCH better off leaving in a little bit of my conditioner.</li>
      <li>and I think I fall into one of the 4 types of hair (can&#x27;t really tell which yet, it&#x27;s been over 20 yrs since I&#x27;ve seen my natural hair).</li>
      <li>curls with shine and no hard hold.</li>
      <li>The next day, my hair was even more of a disaster and extremely dry to the touch, as though I had just been to the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Used this product for the first time last week.</li>
      <li>It has a lot of moisture, so it is good for that, but not for everyday curls with your hair down.</li>
      <li>Ive just reached my 7 month natural mark</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t sing this products praises enough.</li>
      <li>The only issue is that it doesn&#x27;t provide much of a hold.</li>
      <li>I use it to twist my freshly washed and wet hair.</li>
      <li>And at $16/8oz, Souffle is a lot less expensive and a lot more \\&quot;organic\\&quot; than some other very popular products out there that I won&#x27;t name...</li>
      <li>However, the shrinkage is not nearly that much when I use this product on my twist outs.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t find it at my local Target store, accessibility would be nice.</li>
      <li>especially the new growth</li>
      <li>and it kept my hair really soft while allowing it to lengthen at the same time.</li>
      <li>Second, on Day 2, my hair fell apart completely that it was a disaster.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am currently 7 weeks in my transition from relaxed hair to natural</li>
      <li>The ingredients are so pure that my hands aren&#x27;t sticky at all after I apply it, like other products I have used.</li>
      <li>I probably won&#x27;t purchase the souffle again, only because my hair is very fine and the souffle was a little too heavy.</li>

<li> It has a sweet/pastry smell to it, but it is just so strong that it smells so bad.</li>

<li> I have long 3C hair and usually use Carol&#x27;s Daughter products.</li>
<li> (just don&#x27;t lay down on them).</li>
<li> I kinda like that the cream smells like icing and would like if my hair kept that smell after the cream has dried.</li>

<li> My only fear is that one day, the product will just stop working for me, I&#x27;ve heard other ladies mention this problem with other products :(</li>
<li> First off, the smell of this stuff is disgusting.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the product it didn&#x27;t perform as expected.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> After using this product, my hair felt great and was easy to style.  I Will use and purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I use it to twist my freshly washed and wet hair. My twists were never so springy and bouncy before I started using the Souffle! My twist outs are phenomenal as well...I really can&#x27;t sing this products praises enough. My only fear is that one day, the product will just stop working for me, I&#x27;ve heard other ladies mention this problem with other products :( Well, for now I&#x27;ve found my Holy Grail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Different products work differently on every head of hair regardless of hair texture. You&#x27;ll never know how something works fot you until you try it! And at $16/8oz, Souffle is a lot less expensive and a lot more \\&quot;organic\\&quot; than some other very popular products out there that I won&#x27;t name...rhymes with Kiss Bessie&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> After all the hype and you tube reviews I as expecting a better outcome on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It can leave a flaky film the next day when combined with the daily leave in moisturizer by curls.</li>
    <li> I am currently 7 weeks in my transition from relaxed hair to natural and I think I fall into one of the 4 types of hair (can&#x27;t really tell which yet, it&#x27;s been over 20 yrs since I&#x27;ve seen my natural hair). I have been using the Curl Souffle daily for over a week after I take out my satin covered sponge rollers each morning and it&#x27;s allowed my hair to be more manageable especially the new growth and it smells really great. I&#x27;ve been using it in my sons&#x27; very short hair and it&#x27;s definitely made a difference when I brush their hair each morning before school besides the very delicious scent.</li>
    <li> I lucked upon this product when I first went natural and have used it since. I tried other natural/curl products, but none of them have done as well as this one does. I kinda like that the cream smells like icing and would like if my hair kept that smell after the cream has dried. I get nice frizz free (frizz is a big problem for me) curls with shine and no hard hold. I can actually touch my hair and scrunch the curls with that straw feeling and the curls bounce back (just don&#x27;t lay down on them).</li>
    <li> I have several textures in my hair (3b, 3c, 4a).  This product works well for twist outs, as well as wet styling.  The reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star is that I does not prevent shrinkage that well.  I have read that shrinkage is primarily caused by the texture of your hair, so that is something else to consider. I experience most shrinkage in the back of my hair that is 4a. My hair is to the middle of my back and when I used this product directly after co-washing my hair, the back of my hair (4a) exhibited shrinkage to my neck (yes, that many inches!!!). However, the shrinkage is not nearly that much when I use this product on my twist outs. It smells fabulous, made of natural ingredients and I probably will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Used this product for the first time last week. Was hesitant to buy it because I thought it would be like the kinky curly product but was pleasantly surprised to see that it had POSITIVE results on my hair. I added the cream to my hair after letting it air dry (and adding my leave-in conditioner -[[ASIN:B000BH92J2 Shea Moisture Shea Butter Leave in Conditioner 8oz]]) and it kept my hair really soft while allowing it to lengthen at the same time. It has a nice affect on my hair and smells really good  :-). It&#x27;s pricey so I don&#x27;t use it that often.</li>
    <li> I could not stand this stuff. I just got this as a recommendation from a fellow curly girl. And I like to try new products for curls in my hair to see what works best. So I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. First off, the smell of this stuff is disgusting. I cannot stand the smell. I swear every time I breathe it in, I gag. It has a sweet/pastry smell to it, but it is just so strong that it smells so bad. Second, on Day 2, my hair fell apart completely that it was a disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t stay at all. I would maybe use this stuff for cream to put my hair up in a bun or some kind of updo. It has a lot of moisture, so it is good for that, but not for everyday curls with your hair down. I think it may not be good for my type of curls I have, so it didn&#x27;t work for me. So, like I said, it&#x27;s good for updos, but since I already have a moisturizer that I like better and I cannot stand the smell of this stuff, I most likely won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this product since it has all natural ingredients; usually when I purchase a beauty produce that is \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; the quality may suffer. This was not the case with the styling cream. It smells delicious, works very well. The ingredients are so pure that my hands aren&#x27;t sticky at all after I apply it, like other products I have used. In fact,  the left over product on my hands works well as a moisturizer! I do not even need to wash them after I apply it! I have tried multiple different curling products from low-end to high-end, but they all end up sticky or make my hair look crispy or wet. I will buy this product for as long as they supply it!</li>
    <li> This product has great slip! I used it on wet and blown out hair to creat a beautiful twist out. Curls Soufflé will stay in my product rotation. My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t find it at my local Target store, accessibility would be nice.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s perfect for my my short curly hair,I always work it in wet hair my curls is gorgeous ,love this product</li>
    <li> The souffle did exactly what it said it would do. It did give me good curl definition and moisture. I probably won&#x27;t purchase the souffle again, only because my hair is very fine and the souffle was a little too heavy. My 2nd day hair felt gummy.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! use it when performing a twist out - awesome product, provides curls and not hard on hair or to touch.</li>
    <li> I like this curl cream better than....dare I say it.....Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl Enhancing Smoothie.  The Curl Enhancing smoothie leaves the hair feeling strange to me.  This product leaves the hair feeling moist. And afterwards, the hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry or coated.  The only issue is that it doesn&#x27;t provide much of a hold. But I like it better than Shea Moisture&#x27;s Curl Enhancing Smoothie.</li>
    <li> I have tried many many hair care products for my curly hair- this has to be my favorite by far!!&lt;br /&gt;It stays all day, gives my curl definition, lift, and a smooth look.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a build up like a lot of creams do nor does it leave a sticky residue on your hands if you touch your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Its great for natural drying or diffuse drying-I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product did absolutely nothing for my hair. I have long 3C hair and usually use Carol&#x27;s Daughter products. When I ran out of the Hair Milk that I usually use I decided to try something new-this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the smell is sickly sweet, like cake or pastries. If you don&#x27;t want your head to smell like a bakery or candy shop, do not get this product. I didn&#x27;t mind it that much. I applied it to my damp hair and my hair became very sticky, which I did not like at all. By the time my hair had dried, it was as if I hadn&#x27;t put any product in my hair at all-it was poofy, unruly, and dry. (I work in a corporate environment-it&#x27;s fine for my hair to be a bit exotic, but this was just unprofessional.) I would have been MUCH better off leaving in a little bit of my conditioner. The next day, my hair was even more of a disaster and extremely dry to the touch, as though I had just been to the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this product works for some people. And I will try it out again-maybe on a long weekend when it doesn&#x27;t matter what my hair looks like-but I don&#x27;t foresee this ever becoming my go-to product.</li>
    <li> This product will take your curls to another level. It will hold your moisture as well as giving a fragrance envious by other products.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t define my curls or anything but it smells great and I use it when twisting my hair. I say try it out</li>
    <li> Ooooooooh! Ooh ooh ooh! Ive just reached my 7 month natural mark and I just got to the point that I can twist my hair. Ive tried...she moisture curl enhance smoothie...left too much white residue on my hair..use eco styler..it was ok...used softee mango butter..not enough hold...but this!!!!!! My hair is soft..shiny...and best twistout yet!! My curls are moisturized and defined!! Its my new holy grail!!!</li>
