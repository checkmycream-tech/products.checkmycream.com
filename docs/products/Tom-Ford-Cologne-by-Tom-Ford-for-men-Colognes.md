      <li>it takes a couple of hours for it to really smell good.  </li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this cologne as I had tried it at sephora and liked it.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t pleased with this fragrance I thought it would have a nice lasting scent</li>
      <li>so only my hubby smells this good...</li>
      <li>not bad .</li>
      <li>my brother loved his christmas present and I would have had to travel a great distance to get if I was not able to get on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Smells really masculine and not over powering like others and my wife really love the smell</li>
      <li>Subtle, not too strong, great scent.</li>

      <li>future classic...</li>
      <li>The cologne profile on him is masculine and long lasting, a very mature scent.  </li>

    <li> I had high hopes for this cologne as I had tried it at sephora and liked it. The fragrance is very nice. My only criticism would be that it does not last long or the whole day. I still do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Smells really masculine and not over powering like others and my wife really love the smell</li>
    <li> Tom Ford by Tom Ford is my partners favorite cologne.  The cologne profile on him is masculine and long lasting, a very mature scent.  He receives many complements.  The reviews for this product are a bit unfair it is always wise to see how a cologne is going to react with your body chemistry before purchasing.</li>
    <li> My go to...future classic...haha..but it is for what it is...</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT BUT STAINS WHITE CLOTHES.</li>
    <li> This was gift for my son. He first heard about the brand from a Jayz song. He was so happy Christmas to get a bottle. All his buddies are envy of his cologne. ( All in fun).</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t pleased with this fragrance I thought it would have a nice lasting scent but it did not stay on for a long time!!! Save your chips!</li>
    <li> not bad . it takes a couple of hours for it to really smell good.  does not seem to last long. you have to be close to someone for them to smell it on you. i think that was tom ford&#x27;s intention. its not over exagerated. very classy a great for summer nights.</li>
    <li> got it for my son&#x27;s birthday, he said it is his favorite.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband. He&#x27;s a regular user of this cologne so I got nothing bad to say about it. Smells wonderful. I guess the only bad thing I have to say is that the box was damaged on one of the corners. This is my third box I&#x27;ve ordered online and never had any issues with damaged boxes. I personally don&#x27;t care because the bottle was intact but I know a lot of people do so I figured I would note that in here.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my BF for VDay, his first impression was it had that old man smell. Lol old school. But he loves it, not over powering but just right..</li>
    <li> Bought this item as a birthday gift- smells quite nice, but packaging was dodgy; brown box. Not impressed as I then had to result to buying a separate gift bag as it was too late to return.</li>
    <li> I love this on my husband!!!</li>
    <li> Good scent. Smells very traditional yet with a modern sophistication that attracts the classier, more mature ladies.  The scent does not stay on too long which can be bad, however good enough to get the job done.</li>
    <li> I want to say this is bad so only my hubby smells this good... Great producer and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if the cologne is 100% real, but the packaging looked original (both the box and the bottle) and the smell is consistent with what I&#x27;ve bought at department stores. So it&#x27;s real enough to fool me.  Glad I got it.</li>
    <li> Subtle, not too strong, great scent. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This was a requested gift for my son.  The package came as promised and in good condition.</li>
    <li> my brother loved his christmas present and I would have had to travel a great distance to get if I was not able to get on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of Tom Ford for men, but the one I got doesn&#x27;t seem to smell what I have used in the past. Not sure if its just me or the bottle.</li>
