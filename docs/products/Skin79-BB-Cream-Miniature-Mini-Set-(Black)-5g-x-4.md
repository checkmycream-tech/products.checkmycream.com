<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Too light for a tan skin person. Leave a white cast.</li>
    <li> The package looks exactly like the photo what they showed on the picture. I purchased this one to decide which full size I should get, and it really helped. Here is how I feel , hope it will help others to make the decision. The dark pink package and Gold one are both having whitening and wrinkle improvement effect , and these two also have SPF25 in it. For the sun protection reason , you should get these two. The color of the dark pink package is a little lighter(It has a pink tone in it.) than the Gold package(It has a yellow tone in it), because of this the coverage is better than the Gold package. Just as you know, the coverage of these B.B cream can not compete with other foundation or concealer, but it&#x27;s nice to make my make up more flawless and keep my foundation longer to the end of the day. The lighter pink package and the silver package don&#x27;t have any SPF in it, the color are similar to the dark pink package, but not as light as the dark pink one. I can not tell the difference. But the silver package has shimmer in it, so it will have sparkles on the face after you put it on. I am not a fun of that , so I won&#x27;t purchase that one. And only the texture of  this silver package has watery feeling, the rest of them are a little oily feeling to me. But it won&#x27;t feel that bad, because after few hours you can not tell the oily anymore.  I have a sensitive combination skin with little yellow tone, I don&#x27;t know because of the shimmery or texture, the silver one dries my skin out a little bit, the other three does not irritate my skin at all. After I tried them all, in summer , my choice is the Gold one. It definitely whitening my skin color a little bit, but still looks normal if I did not put too much on it. In winter , I probably will pick the lighter pink without the SPF。</li>
    <li> Enjoy it every much and gave one as a gift to a friend. They enjoyed the BB cream as well.</li>
    <li> I mainly use it for highlighting and contouring because the color and texture isn&#x27;t that great for a full face coverage.</li>
    <li> I have never found anything that works this well.  I have a very fair complexion with freckles, very blonde hair, and blue eyes.  I sunburn easily and my skin is blotchy and patchy and I have very dark circles under my eyes.  I also have since I turned 30 had acne which is something I never had even as a teenager.  I have tried every makeup I can find and they either wash me out if they are as pale as my skin tone or look orange or cakey if I try to go a bit darker.  I just got this product in the mail yesterday and I tried the hot pink tube all over my face with a little of the silver diamond tube just around my eyes as a highlighter.  My skin feels and looks amazing.  Just a tiny pat of product and my dark under eye circles are gone, my pimples are concealed and my skin looks even and fresh.  I even put this on my dry flaky spots like my chin and between my eyes and it doesn&#x27;t look flaky any more!!  My husband says that it looks like I&#x27;m not wearing makeup and that my skin just looks really amazing.  It feels very light weight and breathable.  I was afraid it would break me out because I have super sensitive skin, but it did not irritate my skin at all.  It also seems to stay put and not rub off on clothes or sweat off.  It would probably be good for the beach or the pool.  I live in Texas and part of the difficulty of wearing makeup is that it will melt off and I will sunburn when it&#x27;s 110 degrees outside but this stay put.  I love love love it and will be buying more.  I bought from Katie the Babe seller and my shipping was super fast and I&#x27;m super happy!</li>
    <li> too small for what i expect but it okay to use and see what kind of brand the best for you...</li>
    <li> For girls who want palefaces. The product names are idiotic and useless; I can&#x27;t tell one from the other. Clearly made for Asians who like white skin. Glad I only bought a sample kit to try it.</li>
    <li> Should have a bit more coverage; I may as well be using nothing, lol.  I can&#x27;t cover red spots with this, plus I find it irksome that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; because I&#x27;m a blonde who likes to have a tan!! I like that it has sunscreen, though.</li>
    <li> Ok I&#x27;m fairly new to BB cream, I own an awesome one from The Face Shop-and I&#x27;ve tried the new ones in Sephora from Dr. Jart and wasn&#x27;t impressed--I bought this set expecting to maybe find one bb cream that I liked and ended up liking them all  The hot pink and the gold are very similar actually, the hot pink has a bit less coverage and is slightly more mattifying but I had a hard time distinguishing them. I bought the gold rather than the hot pink even though I have slightly oily skin because the finish was a bit better---kind of like a dewy matte, not an obvious i-have-makeup-on matte    The diamond prestige (light pink) is great too, it&#x27;s next on my list to buy--it has more of a dewy/slight shimmer finish that makes you glow a bit--oil control isn&#x27;t as good as the first 2 though so I had to blot--but it&#x27;s worth it because my skin looks amazing in it    Right off the bat I thought I was going to hate the diamond pearl bb cream because it is super shimmery and has little coverage--in fact I was prepared to give it away--but then I put it on just on a whim before a  night out and wow--it made my skin look great--yeah it doesn&#x27;t look the most natural but it still doesn&#x27;t look &#x27;makeupy&#x27; -Because of my skin type I probably wouldn&#x27;t wear this all over my face during the summer, especially if I&#x27;m going to be outside. But when I checked out skin79&#x27;s us website, I saw that this particular bb comes with an attached brush applicator and is intended more as a highlighter so makes perfect sense    So I&#x27;m probably going to purchase 3 out of the 4 bbs, and the only reason why I&#x27;m  not getting all 4 is because the first 2 were similar and because I would probably be forced to admit that I have a makeup addiction lol    If you have a fair to medium skin tone without major blemishes, buy the set-it&#x27;s worth it</li>
    <li> I bought it from Seoulglamour, looking to purchase bigger sizes of the VIP gold &amp; the hot pink one. It got shipped pretty fast, and came in a nice purple package (my fav color!). I love the way they smell, and both feel very soft on my skin. I havent tried the other two in the pack yet though.. Although they don&#x27;t offer very full coverage like my foundation I am pleased with bb cream! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to try. Also came with two free samples of bb cream &amp; a bb cream base.</li>
    <li> Loved it! Great sample set. My favorite was the hot pink. I have fair skin and it looks very nice on me. It&#x27;s bit as much coverage as a foundation and won&#x27;t work as a concealer but it makes my skin feel and look awesome. My skin actually feels refreshed after using it. Looking forward to getting the full size product.&lt;br /&gt;The greyish tint disappears once you use powder to set.</li>
    <li> Have only used the product for one day so far. Looked light when first put on but blended nicely w my skin after a minute. As for the seller...... Great seller fast shipping! Will definitely purchase from this seller again</li>
    <li> If you are familiar at all with You Tube make up guru&#x27;s and their reviews you would have run across the term BB cream.  What is is?  Well is stands for blemish balm.  It&#x27;s claim is that it is like a tinted moisturizer, and foundation that has multifunctional properties.  Typically they have a SPF, whittening, moisturizing, and anti aging abilities and to make things even better it pretty affordable.  Sounds almost to good to be true.  I mean why even use foundation?  Right? I absolutely had to give this a try.  This set was a perfect price (thank you Amazon) and perfect size.  Here is a picture [...]  sorry about the dry hands it is winter... from left to right Super BB triple function, BB Diamond Pearl, Super Beblesh Balm, BB Diamond Collection.  I&#x27;ve tried all 4 and well, I broke out right away.  The consistency is thick. Thicker than a foundation which makes blending a little harder.  I&#x27;ve heard that some people thin it out with a moisturizer or foundation to better color match but I&#x27;ve never tried this before.  It does give the face a nice canvas for applying make up but here is the main reason why I would not buy this product for me again.  Color options are limited.  Enough said.  It is hard to find a true match and I broke out.  Does it do everything else that it says that it does?  Well, it is moisturizing, my acne scars did seem to fade, but I felt like I had a mask on. It is pretty water proof by the way. I had to remove with a make up remover.  I do suggest that if you are interested in trying BB creams to give this little set a try. It may work for you even though it did not work for me.  Do your research.  There are a ton of You Tube reviews on this stuff. By the way my favorite of the 4 was the BB diamond in the light pink bottle.  It was the easiest to put on and not as thick and therefore although the color match is not perfect it was not Bozo the clow obvious. Oh one more thing. I agree with the other reviewers about the BB diamond tube being filled more with air than with product, . . .I guess I&#x27;m not surprised since this is the one that I like.  Hope this helps.more with air than with product, . . .I guess I&#x27;m not surprised since this is the one that I like.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I bought this sample kit to see which one is my shade. Non of them matched my skin color. The sample kit served its purpose and helped me save both time and $. This is why i cannot love it and give it a 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> These haven&#x27;t been getting great reviews, so i was a little hesitant to buy them, but I did and I&#x27;m glad. I have used up the pink one already and it lasted me about two weeks (this is th eone that had the least amount of product in it) and It has made a difference in the feel and look of my skin... The only thing that bugs me is that I can&#x27;t figure out what shades they are (if they have a shade) so I could repurchase when I&#x27;m though with them. Great size for traveling and enough to let you figure out if you like it without wasting too much product if you don&#x27;t. Great deal.</li>
    <li> Too oily for my skin.</li>
    <li> I just got this stuff and i must say it is amazing!!!! I noticed my skin is much smoother and my blemishes have diminished as well! while i don&#x27;t need the whitening  aspect of this product ( I&#x27;m already very white lol) the improvements have been great! I didn&#x27;t have any problem with there being less product in some tubes then the others but i do know that so far i like the gold tube the best!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try the BB Creams of legend, but was overwhelmed with the options. This was an economical way to try them out. Beware the Diamond Pearl: it&#x27;s just BB cream with glitter in it.</li>
    <li> It does its job :)  Good price, my skin has cleared up dramatically.  My favorite one is the diamond.  Came well packaged :D</li>
    <li> These worked very well for me. Great way of sampling the product before investing in something untried. Love that it contains high degree of sunscreen (25) but was non-irritating. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> First off, be very, very careful of fake products on here because they will make you think this amazing product isn&#x27;t great like it really is if it&#x27;s a cheap fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Anyway, on-to the review. I am amazed by this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it for two years now and have obviously purchased full sizes by now. These feel soo lightweight, like you have absolutely nothing on your skin after it dries. It matches my skin perfectly, which I can never find anything to match me. I had trouble with acne scarring and was forced to wear heavy foundation and after a month of wearing this.. the scars were gone! My face was all even, glowy, and gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had anything help me with my skin like this did and still, the best part is, you can&#x27;t tell you have anything on. It blends so easily into your skin - it&#x27;s like nothing is there. I just use two small dabs and blends over the entire face. No more using pump after pump, after pump like I did with foundations. This stuff goes a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coverage is a light-medium, even though it feels super light. I was used to heavy coverage, so I had started by doing half and half with my foundation and this. Eventually, after my scars faded, I was able to use just this alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps control my oily areas, it helps with acne, it fades scars, evens skin tone, protects from sunburns.. what can&#x27;t this stuff do!? Oh, and I also have very sensitive and this does nothing to irritate it, another bonus. My favorite one is the hotpink tube.  (Just as a bonus guide.. to tell if you purchased a fake your product will end up looking blotchy, won&#x27;t spread, won&#x27;t wash off very well and have a weird smell and color. And the larger sizes come with a special silver label on the bottom that the fakes won&#x27;t have or the label will be damaged with like a watermark coming through it.)</li>
    <li> Thought this would be a nice way to try BB creams after all the hype they have been getting. I honestly wasn&#x27;t impressed with any of them, although at this price it&#x27;s a nice way to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, while looking through Skin79&#x27;s products, I found their Crystal Peeling Gel. Wow. Try it. You&#x27;ll be amazed.</li>
    <li> Great way to try different finishes without having to buy a large tube. Also great for travel.</li>
    <li> This is a review of the Skin79 BB cream mini-set on (Asian)Indian origin skin,I happen to be in the medium-fair spectrum of  complexion and here is what I found :&lt;br /&gt;BB creams DO match Indian skin tone,so if you want to try the 4 types of BB cream that this brand carries,this mini package is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Description of each&lt;br /&gt;Super BB triple function(hot pink tube) :This seems to be my fav. so far.The cream is thick and greyish looking and needs a little more effort to blend in compared to the light-pink-tube.It has a full coverage and matches my skin tone well.In my opinion it does looks like I have make-up on but I don&#x27;t mind that too much since I use bronzer and blush to create a natural look.I used only a peanut size drop for my entire face,so that says a lot.&lt;br /&gt;BB Diamond Pearl(white tube): Like other reviews mentions,it does have quite a bit of shimmer.I used it as a highlighter and it blends well. May not use it as a true BB cream on my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;Super Beblesh Balm(gold tube):Again matches my Indian skin tone,it has medium to low coverage depending on how much you use. Used peanut size drop to get a sheer-looking low coverage.&lt;br /&gt;BB Diamond Collection(light pink):Blends well,but I would say this is my least favorite since it left a whitish looking skin that did not go well with me .BB cream is supposed to match the skin tone but I would say this did not.I could probably use it as a concealer or mix match with the hot-pink tube to get a combination but not a fan of this particular tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Like another reviewer mention,I too received my sampler with one of the tube just half full (the hot-pink-tube) I sure hope this wasn&#x27;t a used product :-/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I hope the seller looks into this.&lt;br /&gt;BTW the 3 stars is due to the fact there is very little in the tube&lt;br /&gt;As far as the BB cream is concerned its a 4.5 star :)</li>
    <li> This four pack of bb creams is a great option for someone who is new to bb creams and is not sure of what to get.  I ended up liking all four of them and am currently waiting for full sizes of the hot pink and gold to arrive. When I ordered this sample pack I also ordered a missha bb cream and found that the tone of the skin 79 creams matched my skin much better. Although a bit grey, it really does blend in well with my pale pinkish skin tone.  I think it works to camouflage the redness.</li>
    <li> I ordered this sampler just to see what all the hype was about the BB creams.  The sampler is the way to go to sample this popular brands variety.  As a bonus the seller also threw in a small sample of one of the creams, nice.  If you use a tinted moisturizer then you should love these.  The colors are initially grey hued but blend nicely (I have fair but not pale skin.) The coverage is very light but they spread on well and feel nice.  Personally, these aren&#x27;t for me, I prefer a bit more coverage. The diamond one actually has glitter in it, which is a bit odd.  Could be good on collar bone/shoulders in the summer maybe? As for the long term anti-aging affects, I can&#x27;t say.  But like I said, these would be great if you want a tinted moisturizer with SPF, anti-aging and whitening effects.</li>
    <li> I got this to help me decide which Skin79 BB cream I should get. I wound up deciding to get the Vip Gold and the Hot pink, but it&#x27;s given me the opportunity to try two (the Light Pink and Pearl) that I wouldn&#x27;t have normally tried. Quicker shipping than I expected and the product is great.</li>
    <li> First of all, I am not of Asian descent, and I have porcelain skin with golden undertones. I also have sensitive, combination skin.I only wash my face with Philosophy&#x27;s Purity before applying these BB creams. The Hot Pink Super is great for combination/oily skin.It gives a natural,healthy pink glow to your skin.Good coverage. I like to wear it on hot summer days since it has a matte finish and controls oil.I put a light dusting of Bare Escentuals mineral makeup in Golden Fair on top to set it. My teen daughter puts this on when she has a breakout and it gives good coverage and her skin looks better when she takes it off.Great for teen skin. The Diamond in the light pink bottle seems thinner than the others and it just does not seem to go with my skin tone.I know that it is the shade most recommended for non Asian skin tones.It just wasn&#x27;t for me.It also came off quickly on me.So I have only worn it once. It has a more natural finish to it.The Super Gold is my favorite. It gives a natural finish, covers well (think dark under eye circles,age spots)and does not get cakey when I apply Bare Escentuals mineral makeup on top.It also controls oil.Great for combination/drier skin tones and fall/winter weather when it is drier. The Diamond Pearl is meant more as a highlighter so I use it on my eyelids-really opens up the eyes and wherever you would put highlighter-inner eye,etc. This kit is a great introduction to BB creams since you get to try 4. You only need to apply a tiny pea size amount to your entire face to get good coverage so the little bottle lasts a long time.My skin looks better since I&#x27;ve been using the Skin 79 BB creams. My pores are smaller, my sensitive skin is not as irritated and red as it was. I love what a time saver this is! One product&#x3D;primer,moisturizer,treatment,and spf. I have been getting a lot of compliments on my skin too.</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous trying out BB creams, especially since some of them have bleaching agents. Not knowing where to start, I thought I should pick this sampler set and I was not disappointed! I actually fell in love with all four (and each cream had a special property that I loved).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone else considering this product, don&#x27;t be afraid of the fact that it has bleaching product. I have semi-sensitive skin and had no adverse reaction. I also found that the bleaching didn&#x27;t make my skin look bad, it only helped with the evening out. The only problem I had with this product is that it was slightly lighter than my skintone (I have a more medium tone). I do love these though and this kit was a great value for the price. Now I feel better about buying a full-sized BB Cream :-)</li>
    <li> So I heard about this product blowing up in Asia.  I decided to try the mini set.  There are so many bb creams out there that I was overwhelmed.  I am asian but have tan and oily skin.  The best one for me was the hott pink bb cream.  It was mattifying and kept my makeup fresh.  I have to wear my foundation over it because it was a bit grey for my skin tone.  Not recomended for anyone tan or dark unless you are wearing your foundation over it.  My concern was to prevent future breakouts and lighten up my old acne scars.  Which it did!!!!!  SO IF YOU CAN&#x27;T DECIDE.....  *The gold label is more moisturizing for dryer skin types.  Keeps makeup fresh.   *The Diamond Pearl is very shimmery. I&#x27;m 39 so it&#x27;s not for me.  It would look good on younger skin  *The light pink label feels not as thick.  It glides on smoothly and more transparent than the others.   *The hott pink label.  Great for oily or t-zone skin.  A little thicker in texture. Keeps makeup fresh.  A bit  grey but I use foundation anyway.    I hope this helps in choosing which one is right for you! I think it&#x27;s fabulous!!!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed it to be. I wanted an easy way to test out BB Creams without committing to tons of some product I didn&#x27;t end up liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is four different BB Creams from Skin79 packaged in a box. None of the tubes are all that full, so really it is enough product just to get an idea of what you like or dislike about each of the different creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty fair skin (caucasian) and normally buy if not the palest foundation the next shade up (when I bought that stuff, which is almost never).  They all blended into my skin tone with no problem, and judging from the tint of the cream, they would work on people with darker toned skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What appealed to me about the idea of BB Cream was that it had SPF in it (all four in this set are SPF 25) and from other reviews I read it was a good by itself bit of makeup. I am pretty lazy when it comes to a beauty routine (that is possibly the first time I have typed that phrase).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found I could wear most of these without anything else and feel pretty comfortable, and washing my face at night, I could tell from the wash cloth that it stayed on pretty well during the day. It felt light and unlike when I&#x27;ve worn liquid foundation it didn&#x27;t feel like some painted on mask. It really felt like I had just put on some light cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)Gold (VIP Gold Collection)-- I read was better for older skin. It is the thickest of the creams and is meant to cover more fine wrinkles. It was probably my second favorite of the batch, I actually almost bought it before I saw this tester pack, because from reading online it seemed like the best match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)Hot Pink (Super Beblish Balm Triple Function) -- My favorite of the four. It covered really well and I was the most comfortable wearing it by itself. I liked it not being as thick as Gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)Light Pink (Diamond The Prestige)-- still less thick thank Hot Pink. I found this one worked best when I put a powder on top of it. It really held the powder in place during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Pearl (Pearl Diamond Collection)-- the least useful of the four. It is best probably if you only use it on say your cheeks. It has a shimmer to it, so putting it on say, your forehead..it made me look greasy. However, it would be great as something to put on your cheeks or under your eyes from some fun going out make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put all of these on by themselves and also with a layer of powder (Sephora) and blush to test them as stand alone makes ups and foundations. All of them held the other make up in place really well and helped that make up have a really finished look. None of them gave me the cake face I associate with foundation. Overall a worthwhile buy to find the right cream for me.arl (Pearl Diamond Collection)-- the least useful of the four. It is best probably if you only use it on say your cheeks. It has a shimmer to it, so putting it on say, your forehead..it made me look greasy. However, it would be great as something to put on your cheeks or under your eyes from some fun going out make up.

All of them held the other make up in place really well and helped that make up have a really finished look. None of them gave me the cake face I associate with foundation. Overall a worthwhile buy to find the right cream for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using BB Cream for a while, but only the Missha M Perfect Cover no.13. Otherwise I&#x27;ve used standard foundation (Vichy, Rimmel, etc) on and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin type - I have skin that becomes oily over the day, no matter which makeup/powder I use. (Later in the day if I poke my nose with my finger I can actually just smear most makeup off. God forbid if I got a hug or a kiss at that time). I do have dry flakey spots and do get blemishes often and never have perfect skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty pasty as far as things go, with freckles and a semi-uneven skin tone. I usually have trouble finding makeup that doesn&#x27;t turn me stupidly orange - even in the &#x27;lightest&#x27; tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard a lot about the pink Skin79 BB Cream and thought this $5 pack would be a great way to try it and their other BB Creams. I&#x27;m wearing it now and quite like it so far. Right now I&#x27;m trying the pink stuff. This morning I applied Skinfood Sparkling Apple Pore Serim, then the Skin 79 BB Cream liberally on my face, blended and waited a bit and set it with powder (Marcell translucent loose powder). It looks really natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m VERY surprised. I don&#x27;t look cakey or like I&#x27;m wearing tons of foundation but you can&#x27;t really see my blemishes and how red they are. I was also very surprised at how light it felt, it didn&#x27;t make my skin shiney and tacky after application and how good it overall feels. I don&#x27;t feel slimey yet lol! It has very good coverage but doesn&#x27;t completely destroy my freckles, so that&#x27;s neat. I used to have to set my BB Cream with lots of powder because of how tacky it was and with this I had to use almost nothing! Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already purchased an entire bottle of the pink stuff and am waiting for it to arrive. The prices you pay for Missha and Skin79 BB Cream is FANTASTIC because it&#x27;s better than most $25+ Canadian/American foundation. Plus it helps heal skin, even skin tone, etc. It really is the magic you hear about online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say ifyou haven&#x27;t tried this stuff, get it so you can try the different kinds. I&#x27;ve only swatched the three others and they&#x27;re exactly what everyone else says about them. The sparkly stuff you could probably use around your eyes to kind of give them a more lively look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:D Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a very good set. All 4 creams are pretty good. There was one that had glitters in it. The third tube, that is the Diamond perfect one was almost empty. That is why only 3 stars for this. The creams themselves were of good quality.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me - left my skin looking pale and made me break out</li>
    <li> Love the small size so can try different ones. The Pink was the best for my normal slightly oily T-zone skin.  Wanted to love the Gold since it had \\&quot;caviar\\&quot; but it was a little too shiny for my T-zone. Would have given Skin79 BB creams 5 stars if they didn&#x27;t contain Parabens.</li>
    <li> Package came much earlier than I expected. I was very excited to recieve this, but I was dissapointed that 3 of the four werent even half way full. I read the reviews and knew that there was a possibility of this happening, but not to this extent. I shoul have bought the full size hot pink, since that a much better value. But nonetheless, Its nice to try them all out, and Im really happy I now get to try bb creams for the first time.</li>
    <li> I got this sample set hoping to find a BB cream that worked for me and my skin. I knew that the creams may be too light for my skin but thought it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried all 4 that came in and didn&#x27;t like any. Most broke me out and made my skin feel greasy. Overall, I wasn&#x27;t too happy with what they did to my skin. I can&#x27;t comment on how well they work as BB creams though because I don&#x27;t think they are suitable for my lightly tan skin.</li>
    <li> Good for getting a sample of different BB creams but honestly, only used about 1 tube all the way through</li>
    <li> it was not what i was expecting. i have a combinated skin and i makes me very oily. does not make whats its says.</li>
    <li> I loved them all. Each one fit for different events and were really nice. The shimmery one brightened up my face. I didn&#x27;t even feel like I was wearing makeup. Here&#x27;s a tip though. Don&#x27;t forget to apply all over and evenly. I forgot my forehead and pictures were disastrous.</li>
    <li> Since it is my first time buying BB cream i&#x27;m glad i found this package because it lets you try out different type of BB cream without having so much that if it doesn&#x27;t fit your skin tone that you have to throw a lot away. I&#x27;m very happy with the product!</li>
    <li> I am so glad to get to try different BB creams for cheap.  There are so many varieties and I get first hand.  GREAT shipping. great travel sizes.  Thank you</li>
    <li> Although very small they are amazing there are many to pick from, i use the glitery one at night which is the pearl one, and my favorites are the original pink and vip one which work amazingly on my skin. These are great to try out before actually purchasing the product, changed my makeup skills forever. :)</li>
    <li> Love this product. The coverage is great  and the samples are are almost large enough to call full size.  I  will order again</li>
    <li> I was super excited to get this product, and I was kinda bummed that I would have to wait until mid-July for it to come. However, this product came long before the other things that I ordered from America! Buy buy buy it&#x27;s totally worth it :) All of them oxidize to match your skintone, its kinda magical, actually. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the shimmer in the Luminous Pearl one, but that&#x27;s just a matter of personal preference. SEOUL GLAMOUR!</li>
    <li> Asian bb creams are so extremely different from Western bb creams and I&#x27;m totally hooked! I&#x27;m pretty light though with yellow undertones and these are just the right shade for me. They cover a lot of imperfections and wear them alone without foundation a lot of the time! And a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I only liked one of the 4 tubes. The other 3 did not suit me well. For the price though, it&#x27;s a good kit.</li>
    <li> None of the colors match my skin,although I have yellowish skin.much like asian peole.but these have pink undertones,i used them as primers,i am very happy with my physicians formula BB cream,But its good if you want to try these BB creams before spending money on them</li>
    <li> I got this item in a timely manner, I was very pleased with the delivery. Getting 4 tubes for 5 dollars was a great deal! I have tried all of them and I really like all of them. I have problem skin ever since my second child and this product although doesn&#x27;t really cover for me it does make my pores seem smaller, tone is better and the texture is much better. I use it as a primer and it works pretty well.</li>
    <li> Great set to test out the different products. Even though it&#x27;s a small amount each tube lasts a while. The hot pink one is the best! Fast shipping. Great service</li>
    <li> Good Morning fellow amazon shoppers!! :)Mama,mary here ,and boy do I need sleep!! But you&#x27;d never guess because I&#x27;m wearing my new B-B Diamond collection!!

Even at my age!!!!:)[[ASIN:B002HPBF32 Skin79 BB Cream Miniature Mini Set (Black) 5g x 4]]</li>
    <li> The BB cream is not anything for us with darker teint. I presume it is ok. for asians.  For me it did not cover a thing.</li>
    <li> Thank You SEOULGLAMOUR! I received my  Skin79 BB Cream Miniature Mini Set in good condition.  Thank you also because i received the package earlier than the scheduled arrival of this product.  I&#x27;m glad :) Even though i don&#x27;t know how to check on the authenticity ... To start off, I&#x27;m Asian and lives here in east coast USA.  I&#x27;m trying out different BB creams here, but unfortunately American BB cream are not made for Asian skin.  I felt so frustrated because i had so much break outs just by trying out those products.  I can&#x27;t find any Etude shops here coz I&#x27;ve been using their BB cream for the past years and such a hassle to buy back home and ship it here .  So i searched online and decided to try new BB&#x27;s... stumbled on this Skin79, and i said to myself &amp;#34;why not&amp;#34; no harm trying it, what can be worst than this disgusting pimples... I&#x27;m so happy that you have these miniature trial set to try on before purchasing the Full product.  I guess you&#x27;ll be hearing from me soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oily combination skin&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;Breaks out immediately&lt;br /&gt;Big pores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Skin79 VIP Gold for winter, then Prestige for summer time.&lt;br /&gt;No break outs after trial of the four products.</li>
    <li> These are pretty thick, a little light for my skintone (medium) but blend in pretty well. good coverage. overall really satisfied.</li>
    <li> This set is a great intro to BB cream.They seem to be mostly popular among the breakout/acne/younger ladies, but as a mature lady, I&#x27;m finding that they do even out skin tone. Also spf 2o, which is very good. A little bit goes a long way. May have to buy the pink label to use as tinted moisturizer.There is a language problem-the labels are in Korean,so you have to read reviews and guess about what each tube is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Ok, wouldn&#x27;t purchase full size of any of these</li>
    <li> Not enough coverage for what I needed but passed it along to others in my family who are younger and loved it.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what BB cream to buy so I bought this set to try as a tester to see if I even liked BB cream at all. It was perfect. The Pink and Gold label are my favorite and I ended up buying a full size right away. They are great for travel size too.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes in that product.Sadly it made me more oily and barely covered my acne.I will keep looking for something else.</li>
    <li> I have already left a review here a few months ago.  In summary, it was a Thank you for the fast shipment and quality of care regarding the packaging.  I had the chance to use all the samples.  I have a simple, very-quick-to-none skin regimen.  I just want clean, moisturized, &amp; even-toned skin.  Not too much to ask for but takes research and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have olive-toned skin and I was worried that these would not be the right shade or healthy. I know that having clear skin in the far East is crucial. Sometimes, skin whitening is even more important.  I love my olive-toned skin and I love the glow that appears when I have done the right thing with diet and product usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only 2 out of the 4 samples really worked well for me. The BB VIP Gold Collection and the BB Pink Label.  They blended well with my skin, protected, and required little makeup --IF I EVER USED MAKE-UP. I do have to put some moisturizer on before applying, but only on occasion. The consistency makes it easy to massage around the face, i find it best to use my fingers. Once it is on, I have not had to do touch-ups, check to see if my face is runny or the color has bled on my collar.  Quick note though, along with these samples, I also use the SKIN79 BB Cleanser with Skin Detox. Together, the products work great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the The Prestige Blemish Balm (lavender tube) the consistency is slightly thicker, but still greatly manageable. If do use it, its only for spots around light acne before putting on either of my 2 favorite BB creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Luminous Pearl Blemish Balm (silver tube) is too bright for my skin tone for full coverage so i use is on occasion, when I go out at night, under my eyelids, but just a dab of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products are worth your purchase.  Since using them (July 2012), my skin tone appears more even (even w/o it), and has saved me money. A little goes a long way with them.</li>
    <li> Terrible, chalky, white-ish cream . Save your money and buy even a drugstore BB cream like Garnier. These went straight to the trash.</li>
    <li> I bought these before jumping in and ordering the full size.  There probably isn&#x27;t more then 3-4 applications in each tube, but they give you an excellent introduction to each type and allowed me to decide that I liked the hotpink and that I was getting the gold for my mom.  I&#x27;ve spend a fortune at Sephora over the years (I&#x27;m one of the highest level VIB&#x27;s) and nothing that I have ever bought there or at Macy&#x27;s or Nordstroms has been half as effective or natural as this product.  Beautiful, glowing, natural skin.  One of my students said &amp;#34;Wow, you look really pretty today!&amp;#34;  The diamond was okay (I didn&#x27;t noticed any real difference between that and the hot pink) and I loved the very subtle sparkle in the pearl (I&#x27;m going to get a full size of this for the summer).</li>
    <li> This is a great little set to try out a few different BB creams. I liked them all except the glittery one was just too sparkly for my face-I may mix it into some body lotion instead.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to sample bb creams without having to buy the full size only to realize, you don&#x27;t like it. Loved this set and now I&#x27;ve decided on the gold.</li>
    <li> It is a good set.  I am new to BB creams and this set allowed me to try out their skin79 creams.  I am yet to make my decision.</li>
    <li> the best BB cream I&#x27;ve ever used, only the quantity inside the tube is not filled well, its like it filled only the half of the tube..&lt;br /&gt;but i really like it and I&#x27;m planning to buy more.</li>
    <li> This product wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected, just because I searched BB cream, instead of what I SHOULD have searched which was &amp;#34;Beauty Balm&amp;#34;. This is Beblesh Balm, which is Korean. The product is Korean, which I did not pay attention to. The BB cream works well. It says &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; on two of the bottles, not sure what that means, or if it is lightening my skin... BUT the colors/shades are very pretty. I can&#x27;t tell much of a difference between the American Beauty Balm, and the Korean Beblesh Balm. I am not complaining about the product, it is my fault that I didn&#x27;t read where it was coming from, or the difference. BUT overall I like it, and used it several times since it came in almost two weeks ago! :)</li>
    <li> I am already a fan of the hot pink version.  These are great for travel and to sample the different collections.</li>
    <li> there are four types but each of them does not differ greately from the others. Also the quantity is soooooo little</li>
    <li> I admit, I mostly got this for the hot pink tube since I&#x27;ve heard rave reviews. I have slightly dehydrated skin, sensitive, acne-prone, and I&#x27;m VERY fair (NC15 or so). Korean and Japanese BBs have been my skin saviours for some time, and I&#x27;ve been shopping around for some new ones.&lt;br /&gt;The hot pink is definitely my favorite, the little tube was enough for about a week of daily wear when applied as moderate-full coverage. It feels moist on the skin but doesn&#x27;t look greasy, is just enough tint to make skin look smooth and naturally flawless (not mask-like). The color was light enough for me, and that&#x27;s great. If you have deeper skin, you can use this more as a sheer brightening coverage or just in spots where needed like around the nose and under eyes without it looking unnatural.&lt;br /&gt;The light pink tube was lighter texture, more dewy finish, and sheerer color. It didn&#x27;t do a whole lot for me but I imagine it would add a really healthy finish (and feels nice, too) on someone with already fairly good skin.&lt;br /&gt;The gold tube&#x27;s color was noticeably darker, too dark for me to use, but it has a very creamy, moisturizing feel to it. It seemed a little thicker than the hot pink.&lt;br /&gt;The silver tube was a bit of a puzzle to me. It is FULL of glitter! I suppose if someone was going for the Twilight look it might be okay, it does look very pretty just... not at all natural. Maybe for photography? Oh well.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t know which tones match your skin color, you want to try this mini set first, because after using, I only liked one of them (the bright pink one). Other samples were too shiney (really) or too thick. Glad I didn&#x27;t buy any in full size.</li>
    <li> I liked all of these BB creams, and this set was helpful in finding the right one for me without spending the full price on each.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll write a quick review on each, starting with my least favorite to my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super Plus(the gold tube): I like the coverage, but it was a little dark for my fair (but olive-toned) skin. It was also very thick in texture. It was similar to Missha&#x27;s Perfect Cover, which I didn&#x27;t really like because both feel a bit heavy on my face. However, this bb cream has a more natural finish than Missha&#x27;s. It lasts maybe 6 hours or more. Overall I&#x27;d rate this one 7/10. I would recommend it to someone who prefers more coverage and has skin that isn&#x27;t super fair. It&#x27;s good for oily/combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super plus triple function (hot pink tube): Really good BB cream. It has good, buildable coverage and doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy on my face, although you can kind of feel it sitting there. It also has a very natural finish. My only problem with it is that it is a little too dark for me. I like that it lasts all day. Great for oily/combination skin. I&#x27;d rate it 9/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luminous Pearl(white tube): I love this bb cream so much. It&#x27;s very sheer, so the coverage isn&#x27;t great.. It has enough coverage to hide minor discolorations, but not blemishes. But, it has a natural-looking, luminous sheen that looks beautiful on cheekbones, the bridge of your nose, and other places you&#x27;d like highlighted. If you have very dry skin, you could probably get away with using it all over your face, but otherwise, it would look kind of silly as it is very shiny, although not in an oily or glittery way. It has glitter particles, but they&#x27;re too small to notice on your face. This is also the lightest of all the BB creams in the set. As a BB cream, I rate this 6.5/10, but as a highlighter, I rate it 10/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Prestige (light pink tube): My favorite! I love this one. It has semi-sheer, buildable coverage, perfect for someone like me whoseskin is fine except for dark circles and a few acne scars. It lasts a long time, like the rest of the bb creams here. It has glitter particles in it like the luminous pearl, but they do not make your face shimmery as much as give it more of a naturally dewy look. This is lighter than the super plus and super plus triple function BB creams, but darker than the luminous pearl. It is similar to the finish and color of Etude House&#x27;s Precious Minerals Bright finish BB Cream, but has a sheerer coverage and feels much, much lighter on your skin. I would recommend this for anyone with dry or dull skin, or anyone who wants a bit of an extra glow to their face, and also to those who seek very natural-looking coverage. It&#x27;s also great for people who don&#x27;t necessarily like wearing makeup because it looks and feels like you&#x27;re wearing nothing, except a lot better of course. I give this 10/10. It suits my needs perfectly, although I recognize that someone might rate this the lowest and the super plus the highest according to what their skin needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up  purchasing the Prestige bb cream. I can see myself using it every day. I may buy the luminous pearl as a highlighter in the future, but I&#x27;m unsure if it&#x27;s worth it to buy the full sized tube for that purpose. I&#x27;m glad I bought this set because I would have bought the Super plus triple function based on all the hype from youtube gurus, and it just wasn&#x27;t right for me. I definitely recommend buying this set if you&#x27;re interested in skin79&#x27;s bb creams, but unsure of which one will work for you.</li>
    <li> My skin: I&#x27;m Caucasian, quite pale, acne prone with yellow undertones, and it&#x27;s dry.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this because I&#x27;ve only ever tried Missha Perfect Cover BB cream. I LOVE Perfect Cover, but wanted to experiment. My experience with American BB cream is like comparing a house cat (American BB) with a leopard (Korean BB); it just doesn&#x27;t cut it. Anyways, I tried each of the Skin79 BBs and found them lacking in comparison to Perfect Cover. If I recall correctly, they seem to have rosier undertones. However, I found that the gold bottle (V.I.P Gold Collection) and the hot pink one (Triple Functions) worked better than the other two in covering imperfections. The other two didn&#x27;t last very well throughout the day either.</li>
    <li> This kit helped me choose the BB Cream that was right for me. You get a few face&#x27;s worth of cream in each tube- enough to decide which one, if any, is right for you. This saved me from buying the wrong one because if I had chosen based on the description alone, I would not have picked the one that actually looks best on me.</li>
    <li> I got the same problem with the previous. The pink diamond one was almost empty. It seems every set has the same problem. But the creams were good, though.</li>
    <li> Took a while for my item to arrived. Roughly about 3 weeks. But the product is worth the wait, and it made my oily face so matte and soft. Couldn&#x27;t really feel that I have BB cream on.</li>
    <li> This is a good trial set for the price.  I tried everything already and it was good. I like the pink,hot pink and gold. The pearl is too shimmery. I use that for highlight instead .</li>
    <li> If this is what Korean bb creams are like, it is going to be disappointing to try others. It&#x27;s very greasy, like it must have mineral oil or glycerin in it. It doesn&#x27;t cover well. But it doesn&#x27;t block my pores and break me out. Nice texture. Shipping was quick. Packaging was nice.</li>
    <li> Love being able to try this out for a super reasonable awesome price loved it so much!! I bought the purple one! Same color as the pink but it&#x27;s moisturizing!</li>
    <li> Would not recommend it if you&#x27;re an oily person. I tried these and the staying power sucks as well as the coverage.</li>
    <li> Like a lot of the reviewers, I bought this set to test the different products before purchasing one. I recommend anyone do this before purchasing a larger version, because this cream does contain some chemicals that could irritate your skin, especially if you have sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;That said, I plan to buy at least one of the full-sized versions. In my case, I found the Gold to suit my needs best- I want a natural finish and with some coverage for fine lines. I didn&#x27;t like the light-pink one very much- it made me look very shiny, but that might just be my skin tone.</li>
    <li> All of them cover differently, thank goodness it meets my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this a as gift for someone who&#x27;s before 30.</li>
    <li> Small sample sizes are cute and all. They&#x27;re sample sizes, so I can&#x27;t comment on the amount. Makes for a good gift!</li>
    <li> Shipping was a little longer than I expected. This doesnt work for me but I like being able to try 4 different ones to see what would work for me.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled to have found Skin79 samples for such a great price!!! Their BB creams get RAVE on many beauty websites but I hated to spend $$$ on a full size not knowing which one I should get so being able to get these nice sized samples at such a great price was awesome!! Shipping said would take a month coming from Korea but they were here within a week and did actually come from Korea...great service. I haven&#x27;t been able to try them enough yet to rate them but if you are wanting to try them definitely order these and you will not be disappointed...it includes all the ones I have heard great things about.</li>
    <li> These creams are okay, but I don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re any better than what I can buy in Target. Not really worth ordering from so far away, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I found all four BBs oily.  There was something wrong with each formula.  They were too thin, too shiny, or too light.  If I&#x27;d not tried other brands I liked a lot better (Heynature, Holika Holika, Dr. Jart) I probably would have been more impressed.  They&#x27;re definitely better than all the western BBs I&#x27;ve tried.  However, they&#x27;re just not that good which was disappointing considering all the good things I&#x27;d heard about Skin79.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do appreciate the sample pack.  Trying 4 different ones from the same company does tell me that I just don&#x27;t like the brand.  I&#x27;ve had the experience of hating the black label of a brand but then trying the silver label and loving it.  If they&#x27;d not done the mini set, I&#x27;d probably have wasted money on a couple different varieties to find out the same thing.</li>
    <li> This is a good starter kit the will help you find the rigth bb cream for your skin type. I wish they will offer a kit that includes all their bb creams (this one include only four of the many they offer) I&#x27;m sad to report that none of these four worked for my skin tone and type but the bright pink one worked for my teenage daughter and I will be ordering the full size soon.</li>
    <li> Great idea of a product, but it comes in very light colors. Now it&#x27;s summer, I&#x27;m tan and I look like a ghost.  It evens out skin tone and coverage is medium to full.  Out of the 4 tubes I liked light pink the most (half empty though), dark pink and gold are all right too.    The weirdest thing is that I can not find a full ingredient list-on the package and online. Maybe is in Korean, but if they sell it online in English the ingredient list would be nice.    I received a free sample with the purchase, the only thing in English was the name of the brand Missha, and it is even more light than Skin 79 BB creams, I threw it away.</li>
    <li> not meant for oily skin and was too light for me.</li>
    <li> Too light for me. I will stick w/ US brand BB Creams</li>
    <li> I loved this sampler because it helped me decide which one would work best for me.</li>
    <li> The product arrived, and the box seem like it was opened before. The content in the tube also empty. I able to squeeze two time per each tube, and the content finish. It less than a sample size. This is not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I always like to try new cosmetics, especially foundation, so was intrigued by the Skin 79 BB Cream mini set.  Four trial sized tubes of product are included in the set, each with a short description of the cream and its special qualities.  I have a mostly clear complexion, with some small wrinkles and other age related blemishes –and believe the two anti wrinkle creams are my favorites.  Both were very light in hue, with a consistency thick enough to provide good coverage.  I’ve used all four as a base coat under my regular foundation and am very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> Best BB creat I ever used. Theven drugstore bb creams don&#x27;t compare at all. It went on silky smooth and gave me an even complexion</li>
    <li> There are much better BB creams out there.&lt;br /&gt;Just not enough coverage for me. I&#x27;m glad I got the sample ones instead of full size.</li>
    <li> In love with skin 79 bb creams. The hot pink is my favorite. These would not work on darker skin tones. I have VERY sensitive skin and this does not break me out out irritate my super sensitive eyes which is surprising since it does contain fragrance. But I do apply an emollient cream before to protect. All 4 off my samples contained the same amount of product so maybe they fixed the problem with the emptier tube</li>
    <li> I have used Garnier BB Cream and Urban Decay BB Cream. Garnier was good for the price but it was too greasy. The Urban Decay BB Cream was too thick and didn&#x27;t blend well. I decided to try the samples of Skin79 and I LOVE IT! The pearl one has glitter in it and is not for me but hot pink one is perfect and the gold one is good too. It stays on all day especially if you use primer. It takes about 30 minutes to oxidize to your skin color but it is totally worth it. I will be purchasing a full size bottle of the hot pink SKin79 BB cream.</li>
    <li> with this kit, I can try each kind before making the final decision. besides, it is also good for traveling. love it.</li>
    <li> When I&#x27;m interested in a product, I read millions of reviews and try to find all the information available. After my sister introduced me to bb creams, believe me, I went into information overload mode. My conclusion? This Skin79 mini set is the perfect sampler for the bb cream novitiate.  The hot pink bb cream has the thickest coverage, and I found the Pearl to have the thinnest. I liked the coverage of the hot pink, but adored the shimmeriness of the Pearl, so I blended both together. Voila! Dewy skin + less imperfections. Of course, everyone has their own distinct preference, so this four-piece kit can&#x27;t really do you wrong, since there&#x27;s something for everyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much good about it, and it feels great on the skin but its just too light of a color for me and I have pretty fair skin. Great product I wish it came in more skin colors</li>
    <li> The BB creams did not have coverage. I was looking for coverage but I will use them any way because I think they will be good for my skin and one of them has lots of shimmer in it so it may be good for special occasions . And at least I tried them so I know not to waste money on large ones</li>
    <li> great try-it pack. I love the different options. BB cream is the best make-up product I&#x27;ve worn in my life.</li>
    <li> These are awesome!!!  Now I understand the hype.  They a bit sheer and won&#x27;t cover a lot but it&#x27;s ok.  I&#x27;m not lookin for heavy coverage anyways bc I have huge gaping pores and too much coverage will look gross but the sheerness of these are perfect.</li>
    <li> I wanted to purchase the Skin79 BB cream but wasn&#x27;t sure if it would match my skin tone, so I bought this, hoping that it would give me an idea of how the creams would look like on my skin tone. It took about 10 days for it to arrive from Korea to California.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hot pink is excellent! It blends very well to my skin and does not leave a grey color too. But everything else does. It makes you look like a ghost. Some of them have shimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with the product is the fact that the samples are so small. :(</li>
    <li> I really like these samples. They all pull a bit grey on the skin, but it evens out. The diamond is a little too sparkly for me, but they all are fun to work with. I will use them more in the fall and winter when my skin isn&#x27;t so oily as the shimmer can intensify the problem. I&#x27;m excited to try these in the colder climate.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best way to try out the 4 bb creams!! I have finished all but one of these four tubes. I had already gotten the BB+ (dark pink) in the full size version twice and used it all but I got curious about the other Skin79&#x27;s Bb creams so I decided to get this and try them out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super+ BB Triple Functions:&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Works well with my dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Blends to match skin&lt;br /&gt;Thick so there&#x27;s medium coverage&lt;br /&gt;Spf25&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It&#x27;s like half a shade too dark for me&lt;br /&gt;The smell could be a con (I kind of like it but a lot complain)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bb Diamond Collection The Prestige BB Cream:&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Light weight&lt;br /&gt;Pale enough for me&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Glittery (I know that&#x27;s the point)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super+ Bb VIP (Gold):&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Thick (medium coverage)&lt;br /&gt;Will blend to match skin&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;Cons: A little too dark for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bb Diamond Collection Pearl Luminous Bb Balm:&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Very Light weight&lt;br /&gt;Does make face look brighter&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Insanely glittery&lt;br /&gt;Super runny&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m tempted to buy the full size of the Super+ BBcream (pink) for the third time but I might try out some other bb creams too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to bb creams or new to Skin79 I 100% recommend getting this sample set! (It also lasts a long time)</li>
    <li> It is just okay, its very light. Some of them are shimmery which i dont like, but not worth it</li>
    <li> I really like this set. The product is great. however 90% of the information is in Korean. i wish i could have used the product more but i think it has cocoa products in it, which i am allergic to. other than those two small things the product is great.</li>
    <li> Not bad creams.  They go on a lot thinner than others I&#x27;ve tried, but if you&#x27;re not looking much coverage, that&#x27;s fine.  The gold and light pink cremes are really similar.  They probably have the best coverage of the four.  The dark pink one is thinner and smells nice.  The white one has sparkles in it, but I imagine it could be a lot of fun as a highlighter on special occasions.  Definitely don&#x27;t put the white one all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;This seller is really great, the package got here a a little over a week before Amazon&#x27;s estimate and they included free samples.  Definitely would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> They were definitely creating a nice finish, but after a while, the product would be cakey on the skin. This may be because I have combination skin, so the product does get cakey where I&#x27;m most oily (T-zone). Overall, I would not repurchase it.</li>
    <li> Exellent way to try Skin 79 BBs. They are good BB creams, but I prefer MIssha.</li>
    <li> I like that they are sample sizes and that they shipped significantly quicker than expected. However, on the back of the tube there is a print that reads &amp;#34;201305&amp;#34; and I can only pray that doesn&#x27;t mean they expired more than a year ago...</li>
    <li> Just ok.  Smoothes skin quite well and gives a younger appearance. I fell asleep in it once night and didn&#x27;t wake up to 10 new pimples which was great.  Very light weight with lots of coverage but has a greyish tone that I don&#x27;t much care for.  The shimmering BB cream is too iridescent and should be used just as a highlighter, not on the whole face. Product came quickly and in great shape.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me through the great vines. I was kind of skeptical due to my ultra sensitive skin. So I decided to try the mini set. I am a medium dark complication but have oily skin. The best one for me was the hott pink bb cream. It was mattifying and kept my makeup fresh. I have to wear a tad of my foundation over it because it was a bit offtone for my skin tone. Not recomended for anyone tan or dark unless you are wearing your foundation over it. My concern was to prevent future breakouts and lighten up my old acne scars. Which it did!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;SO IF YOU CAN&#x27;T DECIDE.....&lt;br /&gt;*The gold label is more moisturizing for dryer skin types. Keeps makeup fresh.&lt;br /&gt;*The Diamond Pearl is very shimmery. I&#x27;m 39 so it&#x27;s not for me. It would look good on younger skin&lt;br /&gt;*The light pink label feels not as thick. It glides on smoothly and more transparent than the others.&lt;br /&gt;*The hott pink label. Great for oily or t-zone skin. A little thicker in texture. Keeps makeup fresh. A bit grey but I use foundation anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps in choosing which one is right for you! I think it&#x27;s fabulous!!!</li>
    <li> May very well become my new favorite BB cream. I love Dr Jart but this is too good a price with great quality to not switch. This is perfect to try before you buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure these were fake, every single one looked the same on the skin. I had a full size of one of the minis and it didn&#x27;t look anything like it should have</li>
    <li> This is a great starter kit for anyone who is new to bb creams. I purchased the black kit from Seoul Glamour. It was shipped to me fast. It came 2 weeks before EDD. My favorite one is the hot pink one the \\&quot;triple function\\&quot; bb cream. The coverage is moderate and the finish is satiny. My second favorite is the gold tube \\&quot;super bb\\&quot; I think this one is good for people with oily skin. The coverage is a little heavier and it has more of a matte finish. The light pink tube \\&quot;Diamond the prestige\\&quot; has light coverage with a dewy slightly pearl finsh probably good for someone with dry skin. the silver tube \\&quot;pearl luminous\\&quot; is great to use with the other bb creams as a highlighter for cheekbones,lip bow,and under your eyebrows for a nice healthy glow. The silver should not be used alone it works best as a highlighter. I read other reviews saying that the tubes where not completely full. I suggest to order from seoul glamour. I recieved a set that all tubes were full. I also ordered the pink set from neverprice with half empty tubes. The difference between the two sets is that the black set has the diamond prestige bb cream it&#x27;s in a light pink bottle. The pink set has a lavendar tube of the \\&quot; oriental gold\\&quot; bb cream. So the two sets are similiar. I also want to add that since I&#x27;ve been using skin 79 bb creams my skin has actually improved. Pores look tighter and wrinkles softened and dark spots are begining to fade.</li>
    <li> I love BB creams and travel a lot so I  wanted to try a few.  One tube was half empty but I feel like I got my monies worth,  the seller was prompt and left a nice note, will order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried American-branded BB creams, and they don&#x27;t even come close to the quality of these. Each tube has enough in it to get at least 2-3 full uses out of them. They&#x27;re moisturizing, so if you have oily skin I advise you to set it with a powder after applying. The only thing I wish was different was the packaging - only the front of the box it came in was written in English. The back is in Korean...Shipping was fast, which was great because I was anxious to try these out. I&#x27;m so glad I did. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering a full size BB cream in the near future!</li>
    <li> This set is a great way to try a BB cream without spending a lot of money. I tried these on clean, bare skin to test for moisturizing qualities, as I have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavender tube - most moisturizing, a very light gentle scent that dissipates shortly after applying (my favorite!)&lt;br /&gt;Pink and Gold tubes - couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between them, both moisturize well&lt;br /&gt;Silver tube (pearl) - least moisturizing, adds a slight pearl glow, good for highlighting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of these made me breakout, and I even got a compliment (from a male coworker who said my skin glowed). Do not let the grayish tint discourage you from trying this, this BB cream conforms to your natural skin tone, as it evens out imperfections (it really does). This BB cream is so gentle that I actually used it around my eyes and on my eyelids to cover the discoloration. There was no stinging (I have very sensitive skin) and no cakey, dry, makeup look by the end of the day. I wear this BB cream alone on the weekends. It feels like a moisturizer but evens out skin  like a high-end foundation. Coverage is sheer to medium, but it&#x27;s buildable and can be set with powder. Can be worn under foundation for more coverage. I use this as a moisturizing primer (over my regular moisturizer and under foundation). I&#x27;ve just ordered a full size of the pink, b/c the lavender only comes with the lip/cheek stain in the lid, and I wanted a full bottle of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I also tired the BRTC Aqua Rush, and it was surprisingly too drying for me and it looked dry like a foundation. Go with the Skin79, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> This would be a good starter kit for those who are like me and  is unsure how the color of the BB cream look on your skin. I have been a fan of Skin79 for a long time and has always wanted to tried their BB cream.  I notice that some BB cream on tan skin make people looked pale or too white.  So I purchase this to see which of the four looked best on me. I found out that the gold one looked much better on my tan skin once its been oxide.  The light pink tube is the lightest compare to the gold or hot pink tube. The light grayish bottle is translucent with sparkles.  I really love mixing the grayish and gold together which gives its a illuminating look but don&#x27;t put too much of the grayish one or else you&#x27;ll look a character from Twilight.  You know the part where Edward&#x27;s skin glisten like diamond out in the sun. lol All in all this product is good and I decided to purchase  the gold bottle. Yay!!!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this, as my first bb cream was from holika holika and that was great, it provided complete coverage but it was just slightlyy gray and settled in dry spots making it look cakey; when i tried all four of these bb creams, they were pretty similar and were smaller than expected but the texture is great and light, helps moisturize and blend away the dry spots, and gives the skin a healthy glow; however, the coverage was nowhere near holika holika&#x27;s bb cream but it&#x27;ll be fine if you have very minor blemishes or uneven skin but not dark acne scars. Overall, it&#x27;s pretty good but there are probably better out there, for now I just mix this with the holika holika cream and it works better combined than each of them alone :D</li>
    <li> I had read a lot about Skin79&#x27;s BB Creams and other BB Creams and decided to go with this brand because of the good reviews and the fact that American versions sound like knock offs that don&#x27;t work as well. I&#x27;m really happy I went with Skin79.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this set 5 stars, for the price, ability to compare multiple products in their line, and the fact that I LOVE the hot pink Super+ BB Cream.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t that thrilled with the other three. The two from the Diamond Collection don&#x27;t offer good coverage and are very shiny. One has the \\&quot;pearl\\&quot; glitter look and the other doesn&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone wearing either of the Diamond Collection creams as foundation. They wear like a highlighter/moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;The Gold Super+ looked heavy, like concealer. Ironically, it doesn&#x27;t cover as well as the hot pink Super+ one.&lt;br /&gt;Because I loved the hot pink Super+, I&#x27;m going to describe that one in more detail. I&#x27;m not fair skinned. I usually wear \\&quot;medium beige\\&quot; \\&quot;tan\\&quot; type colors of foundation. The hot pink Super+ goes on grey, oxidizes to a more normal color, and is lighter than I would normally wear, however, it looks very natural. I have bad skin and the coverage with this stuff is great. I dusted on powder (Nars in Mountain) and my skin looks flawless. So if you have a darker complexion, give this stuff a try to establish an even base and dust on powder to add darker color.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to mineral makeup: Starting with nothing on the skin, this cream offers much better coverage than mineral makeup (I&#x27;ve used many different brands of mineral makeup and can say this with confidence). I&#x27;ve avoided liquid makeup for years, ever since finding mineral makeup, but this BB cream feels light, isn&#x27;t oily or shiny and seems to look the most natural of any makeup I&#x27;ve used. In essence, it&#x27;s better than any mineral or liquid makeup I&#x27;ve used. Literally the only drawback is that I can feel it on my skin where mineral feels like nothing. BUT, I use a lot of powder throughout theday with mineral makeup, and it ends up not looking natural, so I&#x27;m happy to trade for a more natural matte look even if it has a slightly heavier feel.&lt;br /&gt;Last note: I have tried many combinations of products; liquid/mineral/cream foundations with primer, with moisturizer, with mattifying lotion.. This BB Cream alone works as well as any combination of those things I&#x27;ve tried. Plus, since you&#x27;re only applying one product, it looks more natural.&lt;br /&gt;Get this kit. It&#x27;s so worth the money.</li>
    <li> You can try all four products to see which you like best.  I find that they all seem to be the same thing and I like them however I do not think I will purchase a full size version.  The four little ones seem like they will last me a really long time. I only use them occasionally,</li>
    <li> I had no idea which cream I would like best. I was able to try all of them and figure out which one it was that I liked best which was really helpful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pale (clear), cool undertones.  Two of these were OK and two were not.  I&#x27;m finding that the shimmer ones look grey and weird.  The hot pink one was the best for my skin.</li>
    <li> I really like the product except I have enlarged pores on my cheek areas and minor acne. So it was still noticable. This set should help you find out which BB cream works better for your skin. It&#x27;s a good starter kit. I got the same problem with the previous comment. The pink diamond one was almost empty. It seems every set has the same problem. Overall, the creams were good.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try different kinds of Skin79 BB Creams before committing to a full-size. I highly recommend this to make sure you find a shade that works for you before you accidentally buy a product that doesn&#x27;t work for you. For reference, I am a W2 in L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s True Match line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give you an idea:&lt;br /&gt;Hot Pink - more matte finish, slight grey cast. I like the finish because even though my skin is dry, I don&#x27;t like a dewy look. Seems to be a decent shade match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VIP Gold - slightly dark on me, very heavy formula that is good for very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light Pink - I didn&#x27;t care for this one. It was less opaque than Hot Pink and a bit too pale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diamond - Could be used for highlighter, but the sparkles make it unusable for your whole face unless you&#x27;re a Cullen.</li>
    <li> Purchased from seoulglamour. I got this pack because I was really curious about BB cream and had never used it before. I did do a fair bit of research before purchasing, and I figured this one would be the safest bet since there is no &#x27;shade&#x27; to worry about - since it&#x27;s all the same shade.  About me: I&#x27;m 23, light-skinned (don&#x27;t ask me what shade I am, I don&#x27;t know!), and I don&#x27;t tend to use any makeup at all. I work in an office environment and have oily, acne-prone skin.  So far as how they are... hmmm. Overall, they&#x27;re really nice, not as annoying to apply as regular foundation/concealer, and they soak in rather well. With all of them, my face looks moisturized and \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; according to one of my co-workers. No, I did not wear any other makeup with these. They come off relatively easily with either cleansing cloths or cold cream. It doesn&#x27;t rub off on your hands if you touch your face during the day.  I do like the gold one, and think I&#x27;m going to buy the full size of that one. It seems to have controlled my oily skin pretty well! It&#x27;s nice and thick compared to the others. The \\&quot;Caviar Extract\\&quot; in it does sound kind of gross, but I&#x27;m willing to look past that.   I&#x27;m not sure about the bright pink one, although I wanted to like it. I might get it at another time, it&#x27;s not that it was bad - I liked it, but not as much as I liked the gold one.  The light pink diamond one... I&#x27;m wearing that now, and I&#x27;m really not a fan. My face has felt oily all day. It doesn&#x27;t *look* bad, it looks moisturized and happy, but I don&#x27;t really dig the feeling. (Don&#x27;t let that turn you off of trying this one - I&#x27;m just not a huge fan. I may just be biased because I really like the gold one.)  I do love the white one (pearl) - sparkly! That one is meant (I think) to be used as a highlighter, not really all-over, and it&#x27;s really thin next to the others. I&#x27;ve been using it in tandem with the others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been reading about the wonders of BB cream for a long time, and decided to shop for some sort of sample kit. I decided on this one after reading reviews of SKIN79&#x27;s products. The three main creams all match my skin tone fairly well, although the one in the hot pink tube is easily the best. The creams all feel lightweight and even my skin-tone out, but still look natural.   I noticed that some reviewers had tubes that were part or completely empty; all of mine came full.</li>
    <li> The product is good, but very very small. VERY SMALL.XXXX X X X X X X X X X X</li>
    <li> I ordered this two days ago and it came in today because of my Prime membership. In my opinion, the BB creams were a lot smaller than what the photo made it seem-- the tubes in the picture look much longer than the ones in real life. Although to be fair, it *does* say that each of the tubes were 5 grams, so I guess it&#x27;s my own fault &amp;#62;.&amp;#60; Nevertheless, I still give this product five stars because I love that I can try each of these BB creams before buying the full products. I already own the VIP Gold Label and I absolutely LOVE it, but it is a little pricey and I can&#x27;t imagine how I would have felt if I bought it on a whim and discovered that it didn&#x27;t suit me. This product lets me try some other SKIN79 products without a huge investment, and let me decide which ones are worth spending some more money on &#x3D;) Totally recommend. Plus, it looks very classy and makes a perfect present</li>
    <li> These are my little fun size travel bb creams. I think by now I have reviewed all of these and love them except for the pearl, it is sheer with sparkle, still very nice!</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy the Skin 79 brand because I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s amazing and the price is fantastic. I didn&#x27;t know which one I wanted so I figured this was a good way to find out what would work. The pink one and gold one are very similar but I believe the gold is more moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t have a sheen like the pink one, so that&#x27;s the one I ended up purchasing in the full size. The Pearl one is a great highlight, and sometimes I just mix the Diamond one into the Gold bb cream for a little boost. These make a great gift, I ordered two more to give to my mom and sister since they&#x27;re still using the cheap drugstore bb creams.</li>
    <li> I thought these products are made in US, or at least instructions to use this product has English translations.  Not happy for these miniature tubes.  Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this sample set, but decided to save a little and ordered it not from amazon directly but from one of their sellers - Never Price. The samples arrived today, and I was not impressed with their quality. I thought I&#x27;d check if they were even real Skin79 samples and went on Skin79 official website to look for their sample sets. Surely enough, the types and graphics on the tubes do not match exactly those on genuine samples (see my picture). So I guess I can&#x27;t judge the real Skin79 product, just the product I received, which did not worth the money I paid and had one almost empty tube.</li>
    <li> I was going back and forth with the idea of a BB cream, and whether I wanted a tinted moisturizer (American BBs) or the real deal - Korean. The price could be better (paid around $15), but the samples are not as tiny as they look out of the box, and I actually got a lot of use out of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The creams themselves are interesting, not like any of the American BBs, and do cover pretty well. Out of the bunch I liked the gold one the most, and I am seriously considering purchasing a bigger version.</li>
    <li> I love this product ! They are much better than using foundation ! I will be buying this product again and in larger bottles next time.</li>
    <li> More air in tube than product. I wish there was more product, I could barely apply over entire face. I&#x27; ll stick with my prefered seller for this.</li>
    <li> This sampler package is an excellent way to try a variety of products without spending a lot of money on full-sizes that may not be right for you.  I purchased this b/c of great things I had read &amp; heard about Skin79 BB Creams, but I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly which ones I needed...each one is best for a different concern and skin type.  While ALL of the BB Creams in this sampler give buildable coverage and are best suited for light-medium skin tones (darker skin ladies will NOT benefit at all from these,they&#x27;re much too light for deeper skin tones!)... I was able to see that the Hot Pink color is best for normal skin, the Gold color is best for dry &amp; mature skin...it&#x27;s VERY moisterizing...,the Rose color is best for combination skin &amp; the Diamond color is very,very light for only the most Porcelain &amp; Ivory of skin tones or used ONLY as a highlighter!!  Although I had problems with the specific package that arrived (to be absolutely clear, these problems were not the sellers fault!!),... I was able to discern exactly which of these BB Creams I need to purchase in full-size bottles to address my own skin issues and I must also add that my seller...SEOULGLAMOUR...was very quick to respond to my email &amp; resolve the problems that I had. They immediately offered a solution when I informed them what my concerns were and were very professional in all their correspondence with me. Kudos to SeoulGlamour for the excellent customer service they provide!!! I highly recommend both the Skin79 line of products &amp; the seller and I would advise anyone thinking of purchasing to buy from SeoulGlamour. They really do uphold their word &amp; stand by their products, just as they advertise. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this line of cosmetics from anyone but them through Amazon because not only are you guaranteed to receive genuine products....this seller provides outstanding customer service very quickly!!!! And fast delivery,too!!</li>
    <li> Each one had a problem but all shared a displeasing smell.  One was too shimmery, one was too cakey, one the color was awful and the other was too glittery/shimmery.</li>
    <li> I liked the product, it kept my skin matte throughout the day.  However, two of the four tubes hardly had any product in it, while the other two tubes were full.  Also, most of the writing on the packaging is not in English, possibly korean.  There are no ingredients listed in english on the package.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hearing great things about Korean BB Creams. BB Cream in the US is basically tinted moisturizer. Skin 79 is much thicker and less slippery. I ordered the samples so I could figure out which one would look best with my skin because the full size products are spendy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diamond BB Cream (All the way on the left in the picture, with the hot-pink package) works best for me. The pearl is very shimmery so I might use it for some occasion when I am going out at night or something, maybe as an eye highlighter? The other two shades are a little too dark for me, but I spend a lot of time outside int he summer so I might get to use them yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, so the ability to sample different shades, this product was great. The cream itself is much thicker than the Maybelline I had been using. It gives much better coverage and it stuck it out on my oily, oily skin, even while I was running errands all day and it was HOT in my car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added some powder on top and after a while I looked a little cakey, so I think I will try it without powder. It didn&#x27;t make my skin look shiny at all once it set, I am just in the habit of adding powder to my face. I would recommend this to anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried a BB cream or has only tried a US brand.</li>
    <li> Really nice little set.  A very good way to see the color differences you read about online. Of this set, the VIP Gold is best for dry skin.  I, however, ended up ordering the Oriential Gold because it was the one shown as being the best for dry/aging skin.  None of these broke me out, and even with my very very dry skin, none of them migrated into dry patches (even the Pink, which is for younger skin).  I am currently using the Oriental alone in a pinch, and as a primer when I get up early enough. One pump for my face and a second for my neck and chest (for protection and covering redness).  I added all of the Pearl from the set into my Oriental for a bit more of a dew finish. Very nice product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to get, and from other sites... these were $20!!!! can you believe it? haaha here is a steal!&lt;br /&gt;of course everyone has their own opinion which is better and this is a good way to test it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Each tube has enough to test one of the B.B. cream for like a week plus!!! (depending if you use too much or a little).&lt;br /&gt;I love it and now i got an idea of what i wanna buy next ^^</li>
    <li> this was my first attempt at bb cream didn&#x27;t know a thing about it , but for a little $$$ you can sample 4 different creams. i highly recommend this package.</li>
    <li> I love this make up. it really made my skin look almost air brushed it was so perfect.. everyone thought i had edited my picture that i took on my s3 with this make up an swear i didnt have to do a thing to the picture my skin looked perfect</li>
    <li> bought them in order to maybe get ah idea of what I wanted. Wasn&#x27;t Worth it. Definitely from out of the country. Poor quality and honestly will never put on my face again. Didn&#x27;t bother even giving away. Trashed it. Save your hard earned $$.</li>
    <li> This gets low stars because I feel that the packaging was misleading and the amount of product not worth the price. Read on for my views on actual product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I expected these products to at least be completely full...but they aren&#x27;t. I only got about two uses out of each tube. The caps are actually heavier than the tubes themselves! Besides that, I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between three of them. The only one I could tell was different was the one I really didn&#x27;t like (the gold tube) as it had this weird &amp;#34;pearlescent&amp;#34; sheen that looked oily and very glittery at the same time. I wanted to buy these because I was really stumped as to whether or not I should buy a full bottle of any one of them. I ended up liking the product enough to go with the dark pink tube with the silver cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true, BB creams are really different across the board. I&#x27;ve tried the Maybelline one and a few samples from Sephora...wasn&#x27;t thrilled. I can&#x27;t really say this product has made my skin better overall as I still have breakouts, dark spots, and patches of dry skin, but I can say it gives my foundation a much more even &amp;#34;blank&amp;#34; canvas. I can imagine that if I wasn&#x27;t currently in a breakout cycle that this would be enough coverage for daytime use on it&#x27;s own. It has a slightly thicker consistency and better coverage than my MAC tinted moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this bb cream, it doesn&#x27;t make me brighter or cover some tiny darkness. I want to try bb cushion cream</li>
    <li> The bb creams worked very well, had nice coverage, and lasted pretty well. However it got three stars because there was very little in each of the bottles, maybe enough for 3 applications.</li>
    <li> I kept hearing how about awesome Skin79 BB Cream is and how it is so much better than American BB creams. I have tried one or two American BB creams and I wasn&#x27;t too in love with them. They were more like tinted moisturizer than actual makeup and hardly provided any coverage. Skin79 does offer better coverage than the American brands I tried, but I&#x27;m still not totally in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this little sampler is relatively cheap at $10. They last pretty long and provide medium coverage. The gold is the thickest and heaviest, followed by the hot pink, then the light pink. The silver is a shimmer and is pretty, but not meant for your whole face. I like that the formula is pretty light, it matches with almost any skin tone, and it seems suitable for sensitive or acne prone skin since it hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out. It doesn&#x27;t absorb well into my skin though, and leaves a light shiny sheen on my face. It&#x27;s not shiny enough to make me look &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;, but not light enough to make me look &amp;#34;dewy.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I bought the sampler to test them all out. The big bottles are more expensive and I didn&#x27;t like this enough to commit to a whole bottle.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s very little in these products. So I&#x27;m only able to try each one for 3-4 days (one layer of application), which isn&#x27;t enough for me to make an assessment of which BB cream would be best for me.</li>
    <li> I like the way this blends in my skin and so smooth.  Unfortunately it broke me out, I am very sensitive.  But a great way to try this BB cream and find out what works best for you.  I really wanted it to work.</li>
    <li> I was able to try and test 4 different kind of BB cream from skin79.  The reason I gave it a 3 were the price - not cheap for a sample and 2nd it only comes in one shade which doesn&#x27;t help it if your darker.  I didn&#x27;t break out trying the product but out of 4, Pink triple function and The Prestige are way too light for my skin tone and the other 2 (Luninous Pearl + brown VIP Gold Collection) - I have to mixed to somehow fits my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Good way to try all the products to see what you like.  In my late 30&#x27;s and like the pink and gold product.</li>
    <li> Great little sampler size. The color is a bit dark for me--I have fair skin--but it still works.  I still prefer Etude House.</li>
    <li> I currently use the Hot Pink BB cream and was always wondering about the others; but I didn&#x27;t want to buy full size bottles and then not use them.  This works out perfect.  The set is small, but each one contains enough make-up for several days use.  Now in addition to the Hot Pink, I really like the Gold as well and have purchased a bottle of that too.  This would be perfect for a gift!</li>
    <li> After purchasing this product, I had high hopes for the product. After using the dark pink one) it helped prevent some shine on my forehead but it didn&#x27;t last long. It had minimal coverage and only made my eyeliner smudge even with setting powder. The gold tube was thicker and did a good job of hiding my dark circles. However, this one along with the dark pink tube was too greasy for me and made me break out. I gave the gold tube to mom, however it made her fine lines around her eyes stand out more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light pink and silver tube are shimmery and good for highlighting but will only make oily areas worse. It&#x27;s not recommended for an all over look, unless you want to look like you dipped your head in oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m only 20 but a majority of the products didn&#x27;t do well in hiding or covering anything. Of course, it&#x27;s not a foundation so if you&#x27;re looking for full coverage, look elsewhere. As for my mother&#x27;s skin (late 40s) it made fine lines more obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While reading the reviews, i found no size comparison, so each tube is the length of a credit card and half its width. Enough to figure out if you  like the product.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this mini set before investing in the full sized product, and I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;d heard a lot of great things about this product, but wasn&#x27;t sure what it was going to do for my heavily acne-scarred skin. I have a lot of redness in my cheeks and scarring from cystic acne. The product makes the skin appear smoother and healthier. It&#x27;s not a miracle product, you can still see all of my scarring and I still use heavy concealer, so for me, the product isn&#x27;t worth the trouble. Also, the diamond/pearl samples are sparkly - something I&#x27;m not a fan of on my face. My favourite of the samples is the Super BB cream.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really great and I decided to buy the BB Prestige Balm one cuz it works the best for me. :D I don&#x27;t like the BB Diamond collection one cuz its too shiny and stuff. The hot pink works fine and the brown/gold one is cool too. It&#x27;s worth it I guess for a try :)</li>
    <li> It arrived on time. I was already using the pink one, but i wanted to try the others and i love them as well!</li>
    <li> I purchased a different BB cream before I tried these samples. Boy what a difference! These do not have very good coverage and one of them, the Pearl, was too shinny. They have no staying power even with powder over them. The other BB cream I compared them to was Holika Holika Petit Moisture. These didn&#x27;t even compare to that one. I ended up mixing the samples all together and plan to use it when I want a \\&quot;glow\\&quot; under the Holika Holika brand. I will stick to the Holika Holika, I love it.</li>
    <li> I tried all four of these and they honestly felt like they were just a standard liquid foundation but with a nice lotion added. It felt nice on my skin, but I have used other foundations to the same result.&lt;br /&gt;The only one I actually would buy again is the silver bottle which is a foundation with sparkles in it that I like to use on my eyelids or on my whole face when I am dressing up for something.&lt;br /&gt;Altogether, I am glad I tried it out and I would definitely use these products again, but I wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to buy them.</li>
    <li> This set has a nice variety of BB creams! All of them were pretty fair with light/medium buildable coverage. The gold one was the thickest; didn&#x27;t like it that much. :( Overall pretty satisfied with this product. Good for deciding which SKIN79 BB cream is best for you. :)</li>
    <li> Have not tried them all yet, but I&#x27;ve yet to frown at any of the ones I have used. As a super pale white girl, with a want for foundation that isn&#x27;t cakey,  bb creams are now the only foundation I will ever use.</li>
    <li> wanted to try out bb creams and this set was perfect for that.  I have only tried the gold tube and that works well with my skin.  I have acne/oily skin and it didn&#x27;t break me out.  Still a little oily afterwards, but I don&#x27;t expect many products to decrease my oiliness. Coverage was like a medium coverage foundation.  Can&#x27;t wait to try the pink one since I&#x27;ve read good reviews on that. Most likely getting the full bottle of the gold one.</li>
    <li> its a great sampler set if you haven&#x27;t figured out which BB cream is right for you, the size is just right too.</li>
    <li> These afforded me the opportunity to dabble with a few options in BB creams. Ultimately, they&#x27;ve become a convenient was for me to have tiny tubes for travel.&lt;br /&gt;They look fine. The ones with SPF keep my skin protected. But I don&#x27;t like them as much as some of my less exotic ones.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully Skin79 will catch up with the market trend of going paraben free with their products.&lt;br /&gt;I have no regrets that I invested in this experiment. But once I use these up, I&#x27;m not investing in any of these options again.&lt;br /&gt;Good for travel. Low impact.</li>
    <li> I loved being able to try the different bb creams, I use the shiny ones as eye shadow, or as an eyeshadow primer. This set allowed ,e to see the different between the pink and gold vip creams without having to invest in the whole bottle. I found out I like the gold better but pink has better coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Also made it a lot easier to take my makeup with me for touchups</li>
    <li> Love the travel size and great way to try the different bb creams.&lt;br /&gt;These are great, haven&#x27;t needed a primer since I started using these.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Loved all the different BB&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I liked that SKIN79 has these mini samples to try out. There could be more product in each bottle but it&#x27;s enough to use twice to three times on your face, depending on how thick the coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a combination skin type, dry but oily in the t-zones. The light pink one was a little too oily for me, so I gravitated more to the bright pink bottle. It will look really &amp;#34;caked&amp;#34; when you first put it on, but it will blend in with your skin in about 30 minutes. It&#x27;s good to dust a light layer of foundation powder. The other two I did not try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product to purchase if you&#x27;re new to BB cream like I was and fun to try each one.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter.  She has wanted to try this product so this is a great way to provide her with the opportunity.</li>
    <li> The miniature mini set is a great &amp; inexpensive way to determine which BB cream is right for you. I found two I liked and two that I would not buy in full size. Nothing wrong with any of these, it&#x27;s just that I preferred the ones without the luminous or sparkles in it. Highly recommend going this route if you do not know which ones will suite your face.</li>
    <li> I expected that I got four different types of BB creams as it is mentioned, but got all the same BB cream even though the tubes are different.  I wanted to test different colors but only got one color, so what the point to buy this mini set?</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted to try skin79 that I&#x27;ve been reading about. Then I found out that there&#x27;s more than one, but I did not want to waste money on something that I might not like (I&#x27;m pessimistic that way) so when I saw this, I did not hesitate to buy the miniature set. It&#x27;s good to use as a tester, not too much in it if you didn&#x27;t like it and won&#x27;t hesitate to throw or give it away but enough to last you a week if you liked it. It lasted enough for me before I bought the big ones. Also, it gave me variations on how each of them looks like. I didn&#x27;t like the pearl one though. It has glitters in it. But the other three was great. I found one that matches my skin tone but the others works great as well. I&#x27;m gonna buy another set for my best friend to test.</li>
    <li> I had never tried bb creams before purchasing this, but this really helped me get an idea of what worked best on my skin. The sizes are quite small, but you do get enough to try each bb cream more than once or twice. I definitely recommend this to anyone interested in trying out bb creams! It&#x27;s much better than purchasing a full sized bb cream, only to discover that you don&#x27;t like it. Loved this!</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and thought this was too drying on the face, I did apply moisturizer before applying and thought way too drying. cakey looking.. the garnier bb is better if you have dry skin. thought the champagne colored tube was best out of bunch</li>
    <li> This product would be great if you are fair or fair to medium and want a matte finish. I live in Hawaii so I am fairly tan and don&#x27;t want a matte finish.</li>
    <li> it helped me to try the best skin79 bb that fits my skin so happy to try them, each is enough for almost 4 usages which gives you enough time to judge the best one!</li>
    <li> I wanted to see if I liked these (I do!) and which ones matched my skin so this was perfect! I liked them all expect the silver one.. It&#x27;s a little shimmery and I don&#x27;t like how it makes my skin look. This helped me decide to buy the hot pink one to use every day! I still have some left in my samples and will use them up soon. It&#x27;s a decent amount - enough to try each at least a few days, if not for a whole week.</li>
    <li> If your no sure which to get, i would do this. I liked some more then others and my favorite one the one with the pink top and silver body i couldnt find on amazon, so i ordered another which i didnt like.  I enjoyed trying the different bb creams depending on the coverage i needed, some are lighter etc. good price.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine introduce Skin79 a couple weeks ago and was told to look up their reviews from Makeupalley.com. Everyone seemed to be pretty impressed, so I decided to try it out. So far I&#x27;ve only used the light pink sample bottle and love it! I haven&#x27;t even tried the other ones because this one impressed me so much. I guess I should experiment with the others soon. Now I have fairly pale skin, so this worked great for me. I didn&#x27;t have any issues with breaking out or dry skin either. It&#x27;s really all about experimenting, this product won&#x27;t work for every single person, however it worked excellent for me! I will continue purchasing Skin79 from now on!</li>
    <li> Shipping was slow it took almost a month to come , but the product is decent . It gives me an overview on how the actual bb cream product might look like .</li>
    <li> It is a little dry for me. Maybe it is because my skin is kind of dry. But anyway, the sample is good for me to try.</li>
    <li> I love it the product arrived fast and in excellant condition, I am stocking up on more of this product but this time it will be the full size!</li>
    <li> Bought this along with the missha to see which I would like and this one has too much grey in it. Luckily it was the samples so no dent in my wallet</li>
    <li> These 4 little tubes contain more than one might think, because it requires so little of it to do the job. This will last me a long time.  The different types are all good. I have very light skin, and these are not too dark for me. The coverage is not as much as I would like but I have freckled older skin that nothing covers the way I&#x27;d like! It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> On the plus side, the product shipped quickly and was received in less than a week-impressive!  The sample sizes allow you to try out the various BB formulas before making a bigger commitment and potentially wasting your money.    The creams look like putty, apply smoothly, and are probably better suited for fair to light complexions.  The hot pink is the most mattifying.  There isn&#x27;t much coverage so their best use is as a primer.  Like most primers, Skin79 products contain silicone (dimethicone).  If your skin is sensitive to silicone you will probably want to avoid this purchase and keep looking.  You can find a detailed list of ingredients for Skin79 and other cosmetics at [...].    Since products that contain silicone break me out I will stick with my Aveeno Positively Radiant Tinted Moisturizer.</li>
    <li> First off, don&#x27;t expect a lot of coverage. Also, feel free to mix a little of each. The pearl is sheerest and has a lot of shine. The gold is not as sheer and less shiny. The hot pink is my favorite with the gold adding a little bit more coverage. I then use Tarte&#x27;s amazonian clay powder to set my makeup, and I&#x27;m done! I&#x27;m happy with this product. This is my second purchase.</li>
    <li> When I first started getting into BB creams I was really overwhelmed. This set was a great way for me to try out a four different styles at a very cheap price. The sparkly one is VERY sparkly so be careful!</li>
    <li> Great foundation.  I particularly like the hot pink one!  This is the perfect set for someone who is starting to use BB creams.  You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I do not break out. I have tried all sorts of creams  foundations primers tinted moisturizers you name it. This Gray goop which feels like mayonnaise did gradually blend in but every day left me with another zit the hot pink being the worst. Keep them away from me!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a sample of 4 BB creams from skin79, but I didn&#x27;t like any of them. Two are sparkly so definitely not suitable for daily wear. The other two are much too light for my skin tone. I have Asian skin, medium tone (I wear the neutral color from Clinique) but these made me look like a ghost. I think that unless you&#x27;re fair or neutral fair on the Clinique scale, save your money and don&#x27;t bother with these.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to try out  Korean BB creams if you&#x27;re just getting into them. The sample sizes are small, but a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m very, very pale and had no trouble matching these to my skin. I loved the texture of these and will probably buy a full size of at least one of these when my samples run out.</li>
    <li> understand it comes from south korea but takes forever to receive..  This is for amazon do not put requirements on how long comments should be</li>
    <li> Great way to try the different formulas- I love the hot pink best. I have combo skin and it seems to work pretty good with it.</li>
    <li> And that&#x27;s exactly what they are, samples. The tubes are small and the cream inside is maybe half or less than the size of the tube. If you&#x27;re looking to try this line, this sample set is great.</li>
    <li> My samples didn&#x27;t even have enough for one full application each. I wanted to see if I would like them but I wasn&#x27;t even able to do a whole face so I am not really any more sure than before I bought them. They were very small tubes and no where near full, not even 1/2 full. I would want enough to wear each maybe two full days to really see how they wear and comapir but that didn&#x27;t happen at all. It&#x27;s not like I am going to go about my day with two different maekups on each side of my face. I may have just gotten a bad pack but I was disapointed. It&#x27;s just my experience. Everyone else seems to like them, sad I will never know. Doubt I will try again as they take forever to come.</li>
    <li> Not sure but I got rashes, breakout and hives - maybe it does not too well on ethnic or sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the BB cream scene and didn&#x27;t know which of this particular band I would want to try. Enter the sample pack! Great way to trial run the different formulations and see which works for you while all are very light coverage there are subtle differences- the light pink: very light coverage, the hot pink- medium coverage, the gold- the most coverage (and my favorite). The pearl is a great highlighter. I now can move on to full size and make the right choice. The color match was perfect and there wasn&#x27;t any over oxidization.</li>
    <li> Actually bought two of these for my wife and man was I the Hero. She loved it and went on about it for the whole next week.&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t know much about beauty products but by the way she acted this stuff is great haha!</li>
    <li> I liked the set, because I was able to try some different bb creams. If you don&#x27;t want to use makeup one day because you are at home, you just apply a little bit of this bb cream and you will be ready.&lt;br /&gt;After buying this set, I bought a bigger bottle of one of these bb creams. Too bad I bought the wrong one!  :(</li>
    <li> I bought this set because I wanted to try a Korean BB cream as oppose to an American tinted moisturizer marketed as BB cream, but didn&#x27;t want to buy something that wouldn&#x27;t match my skin color. I was very impressed by how quickly I got the products, they&#x27;re all the same color and pretty much all do the same thing using different ingredients, which is useful if you&#x27;re sensitive to certain ingredients. They all blend very well and offer more coverage than I expected which is a nice plus, and getting all four helped me decide I&#x27;d like to buy the the Skin79 diamond bb cream in the full size.</li>
    <li> I like this, it was a good way to test out BB.  But, I happened to also try Covergirl&#x27;s BB, and it is way better in my opinion.  This stuff still left my face drying out and peeling, while CG BB cream did not.  The colors were nice and all, but who cares when your face starts peeling half way through the day?</li>
    <li> This set was a great way to try the product without breaking the bank.  The product is great and I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Nice little set to try different bb creams out. I honestly don&#x27;t love any of these but I will use all of them up. The pearl one definitely isn&#x27;t an all over product, a nice highlight though.</li>
    <li> These are too dark for me (I&#x27;m a shade darker than albino), but overall, I really like this product. It feels more like putting on a moisturizer than makeup, but it blurs imperfections and gives a sheer to medium coverage. It does have a grey hue to it, but it doesn&#x27;t set that way on the skin. The lightest shade is the Hot pink, and the darkest is the gold. The pearl is VERY sparkly, but I&#x27;d use it to put a bit of shine on the tops of cheeks.</li>
    <li> product came in excellent condition. loved the creams, except the diamond pearl one. that one was just a shimmery hot mess. don&#x27;t use it unless you REALLY like shimmer. i&#x27;m mexican with tan skin, so going on it does look too light, but just let it oxidize and then it looks really good! also, be sure to buy from seoul glamour, so you get the real stuff :)</li>
    <li> Best BB cream on the market and I have tried them all. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. The Texture is so rich and creamy. It covers up my acne scarring, pores, and skin discoloration beautifully.</li>
    <li> The 4 bb creams in this sampler are amazing!!! There isn&#x27;t a bad one in the bunch.&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer gave an amazing description so I&#x27;ll keep mine brief. My fave is the gold...it&#x27;s a bit more moisturizing and sheer I think.  Hot pink is my second fave. The diamond one is just a luminizer, so you just highlight with it and it looks totally natural, not shiny or sparkly.&lt;br /&gt;These tubes are sample sized...I don&#x27;t know what people don&#x27;t understand about that...You&#x27;re not getting full-sized prods for $11. But the sample sizes are really pretty good sized...I&#x27;m sure you can get several applications out of each one.&lt;br /&gt;There are tons of videos on YouTube so you can see how to apply the creams too. It isn&#x27;t like regular foundation...I found watching the video helped me alot.  I love love love how my skin looks in the BB cream!!! Soft, dewy and natural--not mask-like or fake.  You an apply it in multiple layers to build coverage, and it works *really* well as an eye area concealer...And I have horribly dark circles, but this really covered them nicely...In fact, I don&#x27;t want to use regular concealer anymore because it seems very drying and cakey compared to the BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;I can see why everyone&#x27;s addicted to these things because they are phenomenal!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup fan, but at 43, I&#x27;ve been feeling like I could use a little help.  My lightweight moisturizer with occasional mineral powder isn&#x27;t doing much.  I also need more than the minimal sun protection I get from my SPF15 lotion.  After some research, I decided to give this set a try so I could test a few different BB creams without much commitment.  I am really surprised with the difference these make to my skin.  I am a natural redhead with light skin with golden undertones and a tendency to turn red and blotchy easily.  I had severe acne in my younger years, so I&#x27;m always concerned about possible breakouts, but I also need moisture, especially as I&#x27;ve gotten a little older.  My pores are somewhat large, especially on my nose, and I get scaly, red skin at the corners of my nose.  Sounds lovely, huh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried each of these creams and found the Hot Pink to be the best match for my skin, although the Gold is so similar that they could be used interchangeably.  It seems to me that the Hot Pink is a little more moisturizing (my face feels a bit tight with the Gold), and the Pink has a slightly more rosey undertone, where the Gold is a little more grey.  But the difference is very slight.  I ended up ordering a large bottle of the Hot Pink.  I use a light moisturizer first, then dab this on and blend it in.  Even in my magnifying mirror, I can&#x27;t see it on my skin.  The skin just looks...better.  Much better.  It blends away the redness and lightens my freckles, minimizes my pores, and gives me a lovely, smooth finish.  I&#x27;ve worn it to the gym and running, and it doesn&#x27;t slide down my face or transfer to my towel or clothes.  The most remarkable thing, though, is that when I take it off, my skin looks better underneath.  To my great surprise, the chronic scaliness at the corners of my nose--which I have treated with prescription meds without success--is GONE.  Completely gone.  And the redness has faded dramatically.  I also have spider veins there, caused by the meds, and they are less noticeable already, after one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve been considering trying a BB cream, this is a great way to do it!</li>
    <li> I normally do not wear a foundation at all but getting into my 30&#x27;s I started getting a little acne here and there so I wanted to be able to cover it up.  Foundation is so thick and restricting. I saw a review about Skin79 on a blog so I tried it.  AMAZING!! My skins feels softer then ever, no break outs since using it and for me it gives great coverage.  I really like the Super the tan bottle the best. My 2nd choice would be the hot pink. The other two were great and I used them BUT were a little more sheer maybe for a younger person.  I am now going to buy a full bottle!! WORTH IT!!! BUY IT AND TRY IT! getting the four pack helps then you can decide which would work best for each person, I wish the orange one was included that is the only downfall to me!</li>
    <li> I bought it to see if &amp;#34;Skin79&amp;#34; products would suit me! I found it as a practical trial set for the product!&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of the effectiveness on my skin, I think they are good samples...&lt;br /&gt;I rate it 4, because I would like to see more samples choices from the supplier!</li>
    <li> im a lightskinned black girl and these were not my color , only get if you are pale to meuduim</li>
    <li> These bb creams are way to light and smell mediciny. I would not reccomend them to a friend.</li>
    <li> Inconsistent samples.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed about how little product there is in the tubes. There are barely enough for 3 applications so the price is kind of expensive for what it is.</li>
    <li> The product is amazing, coverage is great and  the price was amazing. The seller did excellent in my eyes. While it took forever to get her via USPS, it was christmas season ,so this gift did not make it  on time. This is my fault for not paying to expedite it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Skin 79&lt;br /&gt;Pam Rutledge&lt;br /&gt;Blue Mountain, MS.</li>
    <li> Not all of these BB creams work that well for me (some are shiny, which I don&#x27;t like), but this was a perfect way to try out a variety and find what did work.  Too, the packaging is perfect--easy to get product out, easy to reuse, and not too small.</li>
    <li> I bought this set to try out the different varieties of BB creams made by Skin79, and this set has convinced me that they are all exactly the same.  I also have tried Garnier&#x27;s BB cream (which is much less expensive), and it works just as well.</li>
    <li> Two of the BB creams I received are almost empty. I&#x27;d say not even a 1/3 of the way full. The other two are not quite half full. I have researched and this is not normal.</li>
    <li> Not great for dark asian skin.</li>
    <li> Awesome BB creams!!! all of them had great coverage they just had different sheen levels. I am not into pearlized or dewy look so I was grateful that I tried these out before purchasing the full size bottle. I liked the Pink Label the best since it was super matte and kept me matte the whole day!!! It was also a plus that they came in time for an upcoming vacation and I could pack them in my purse just in case :)</li>
    <li> Love these samplers, they allow me to figure out the right formula for every time of year and every situation.</li>
    <li> Out of the four, I only could use 2, I have deep toned skin, an this product is for porcelain to fair skin, love the luminous one.....really gave me a great body shimmer</li>
    <li> I really like these BB creams, and I love the tester. The shiny one is great for the under eye area, hides dark circles well. I like all of the other creams too, I think the hot pink is my favorite.</li>
    <li> My sister used this, she really like it</li>
    <li> These again smell great they are all roughly the same color but they do seem to very in the finish. Some are more shiny and one almost has a sparkle to it like a highlighter maybe. The do work well and are perfect travel size.</li>
    <li> I prefer the new Garnier oil free BB. This is so greasy. I&#x27;m extremely particular though, and get really anal about any sort of anything on my skin with oil in it. I&#x27;m sure this is fine for most.</li>
    <li> As always, love the SKIN79 line of products and so glad someone introduced me.&lt;br /&gt;My new favorite is the pearl, which is like a shimmer.</li>
    <li> My very first time buying bb cream. I wanted to know which one worked for me without spending a lot of money. With this pack I found what I needed. Its a great buy. If you let them oxidize the light ones tend to get a little lighter and the darker ones will get a little darker ( but not always ).</li>
    <li> I love these, because instead of buying a large size and hoping it will work, I was able to try out 4 different types of BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, with dry patches, oily areas, and acne. I ended up loving the Hot Pink Super Plus BB cream and buying the large size.&lt;br /&gt;It has good coverage and didn&#x27;t make my skin greasy. The other three didn&#x27;t have as good of coverage and either made my skin super oily, or made me look shiny (or &#x27;pearly&#x27; as the products say). I haven&#x27;t noticed much &#x27;anti-wrinkle&#x27; effects, but then again, i havent noticed any NEW wrinkles, so i suppose its working?</li>
    <li> This product is awesome on so many levels:  it goes on smoothly, it lasts, and it&#x27;s actually light enough (I have red hair, blue eyes, pale skin and freckles - almost *nothing* is the right shade for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost everything about this product (all four bottles) is perfect.  What&#x27;s not awesome is that they broke me out pretty badly.  So if you don&#x27;t have acne-prone skin, definitely get this, but if you do have acne-prone skin, maybe think twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Then again, it&#x27;s so cheap, why not try it?)</li>
    <li> such a great  sample for me and i would buy again</li>
    <li> This only looks good if you have fair skin</li>
    <li> I thought that this BB Cream Mini Set would be great for a friend. She is into makeup products. I figured that she could try out these BB Creams since she has never used any before.</li>
    <li> Was perfect for trying out a variety of BB creams at a low risk. Will be buying some full-sizes right away! :)</li>
    <li> I love having a variety of samples to see what works best for me.  The empty tube is very disappointing as it was the one product that was a highlighting product that I really wanted.  So I basically got three quarters of my order and have to go buy a highlighter now.</li>
    <li> All very overwhelmingly perfumed, had thin coverage, and overall made my skin look no better than usual. All were too dark for my skin, other than the Pearl, I think. One of them even had bits of glitter, which is probably some kind of titanium dioxide/heavy metal anyway. Dissapointed. :/</li>
    <li> I LOVE this BB cream. Especially the VIP Gold. It is absolutely perfect for my skin. I like how this sample pack gave you an opportunity to try them all without spending an outrageous amount of money. Although the Gold is my favorite the other ones are very good too. They just provide lighter coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really important to note that one of these is only a highlighter. This is the diamond pearl. It is not meant to be applied all over the face. It should only be emphasizing points you&#x27;d like to highlight. It has jut a touch of sparkle to really bring those points to the forefront. It works great. It is currently my favorite highlighter!</li>
    <li> I bought this to find out if the bb creams from Skin79 would be a good fit for my skin. I was happy with the amount of product received and was able to decide which full-size product to order after trying these. The &amp;#34;diamond pearl&amp;#34; bb cream is actually not a foundation-type finish, but makes a fab highlighter.</li>
    <li> It did take awhile to get the product but i was not really in a hurry. Its great to try out more than one so you know which one you like</li>
    <li> I found this line to be very oily. I don&#x27;t even have oily skin. Any type of sweat made it feel gritty on my face. I found it offers no help in evening skin tone or texture. I was hoping to find a cheaper replacement for Dr. Jart+ but this is not it. I will never buy again. You definitely get what u pay for.</li>
    <li> These are good quality BB creams! Small, so good if you just want to sample them.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the prompt delivery and follow up from the seller to make sure I had received the product and let me know how I could return it if I didn&#x27;t like it.  That information isn&#x27;t usually volunteered by sellers and I thought the attention they paid to customers was really nice.  The sample creams are all great as moisturizers, sunscreen, and primer for makeup; I have medium tone caucasian skin and found they were all too fair for me to wear alone.  I have used several other BB creams that came in my skin tone which I prefer because they can be worn alone, but I do like using these Skin 79 BB creams to even skin tone and protect under my foundation (or have also blended with my other, darker BB cream.)  They are nice and lightweight and the only reason I won&#x27;t likely buy them again is the porcelain lightness of the color; they are perfect for someone who prefers to wear BB cream under foundation, or for someone who is quite fairskinned.</li>
    <li> After reading about BB Cream and Skin79 I decided the best option was to try out a mini version to see what version worked best for me.  There are other reviews that give detailed descriptions of each one and I advise to read those as they were very helpful for me.  They only lasted a short bit (except for the pearl as I still have that.  It&#x27;s very shiny and I only use it on accent areas), but gave a good idea of what larger version I should get.</li>
    <li> Cute set. I had tried the Gold bottle before but wanted to try out the rest without having to buy a full size one. After trying these I switched to the light pink Diamond BB cream</li>
    <li> Great product to use on the go.&lt;br /&gt;Each tube has just a slighly different color,and can match your make up for day or night.&lt;br /&gt;Has nice light smell,not abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;Lays evenly on the skin and is fast to absorb. Doesn&#x27;t leave marks on clothes.</li>
    <li> None of these worked for me. The colors just didn&#x27;t work with my fair neutral-to-cool skin tone. They either looked yellow or gray on me. I gave them away.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff!  I started to buy the small trial size because I purchased the &amp;#34; &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; one not too long ago and it broke so when I cracked it open in there was a very small tube connected to the big one in this tube was the moisturizer and it was a very very small amount I felt fooled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought buy the big one it has more but in reality its just a small capsul in a big tube and its expensive! So here I bought these measured them out and found I get way more  moisture for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> This is a great way to find out what products you will love. SKIN79 products are wonderful, but I always had a hard time trying to figure out what differences there were between all of them. This sample set really helped me figure out which was my favorite. I loved them all except the pearl one... it is... so pearly- you kind look like a disco ball. Could be fun for like a rave or something but I don&#x27;t think the normal wearer would get much use out of it. The other three are great though. Products lasted me almost 2 months so great sized set. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Wanted to try out bb cream before I committed to a whole bottle. This was a great option. Each tube gave me a week&#x27;s worth or more to try it out. The bright pink and gold were my favorite.</li>
    <li> it was good for me to sample all the different types and make a decision on the best before buying the full sized version&lt;br /&gt;loved the pearl as a highlighter&lt;br /&gt;the gold was kinda greasy&lt;br /&gt;the hot pink is OK but my skin gets oily after a few hours&lt;br /&gt;the light pink is greasy as well</li>
    <li> Extremely fast shipping but one bottle of BB Cream is nearly empty. I was very excited to try this product and this left me somewhat disappointed. A great way to sample Skin79 BB Creams but not sure I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and easy. Most of the colors were too light for me so I gave the set to my little sister. She enjoyed them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for these creams</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a mini set of bb cream first. I havent never used a bb cream before. Im glad I tried this mini set. It helped me to decide which bb cream would be the best for my skin. All of them are really good. I checked the reviews and decided to try this. I personally like all of them. The gold bb is thicker than the others. The pink has medium coverage. If you&#x27;re wanting to try a bb cream, you should invest in this mini kit. Great price and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Out of all of these samples, the hot pink tube was my favorite. Nothing truly against the others, except maybe the diamond and pearl (i hate shimmer). I will totally re-buy the larger version of the Pink :)</li>
    <li> Great 5 sample pack of Skin79 BB Creams.  Good variety in the lighter colours.  Nice if one wants to sample the BB Creams for more than one use without making a major commitment to a large bottle.  Great for keeping in the purse and for travel.  Excellent value.</li>
