### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>But I have tried a lot of products, and this one has been the best.</li>
      <li>admit, I almost refrained from writing an official review on this product because I wanted to keep my awesome results to myself, but my sense of duty to pay this beauty tip forward as my friend did to me kept nagging at me.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve tried it every which way and have found that it works BEST when over moisturization/sunscreen and UNDER my makeup.</li>

      <li>Great Stuff,</li>
      <li>Good quality, very suitable for my friend!</li>
      <li>Plus it comes in a cute tin that I can carry in my purse, perfect size to bring on the go.</li>
      <li>Looks good with no foundation at all, my skin has a smoother appearance.</li>
      <li>And I believe  Tissot is a good brand.</li>
      <li>I need to keep up the good mojo if I want to continue hearing about beauty secrets that work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it smelt good</li>
      <li>i bought 4 of the denefit cosmetics DR feel good from here send for my friends as a gift.</li>
      <li>it was very good and have so many benefits for healthy</li>
      <li>and I fell in love, but when I ordered it the case was all beat up and it looked used!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>it is nice to order it online.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>However it does smelly really nice, and is great to use to smooth out lines from foundation.</li>
      <li>nice i like it.</li>
      <li>When I am in a rush, sometimes I just apply the Benefit without my foundation, and I still get that nice even tone look.</li>
      <li>You should buy it from some where else honestly.</li>
      <li>but I liked the description of what this product does</li>
      <li>My foundation goes on very smooth and even, I get a nice dewy look to my skin.  </li>
      <li>It is very skinny and smells very good.</li>
      <li>I wanted this product to be amazing, however I have to admit its just OK.</li>
      <li>but it makes my cheeks glow and look healthy, like a nice highlighter.</li>
      <li>(Believe me, I know how this sounds - way too good to be true.)</li>
      <li>I mostly use this as a primer under liquid or cream foundation, works better than the drugstore and department store primers I bought before Dr. Feelgood.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>I love it and plan to buy it again~</li>
      <li>Make sure to check the code for the expire</li>
      <li>&quot; my skin unlike most cosmetics products.</li>
      <li>This was not an authentic Benefits product.  </li>
      <li>and I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>not appear to make me break out more</li>
      <li>People love Benefit makeup</li>
      <li>Although the instructions say to apply on top of makeup, I don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I like it really good, i like it very much.</li>
      <li>Also, I cant use the sponge (it picks up too much of the already applied makeup), i have to use my fingers to gently pad the product, to make sure it doesn&#x27;t make me look like my cheeks are sweating LOL!</li>
      <li>However, if you like to go out with nude look skin sometimes, this should be a pretty good skin refinisher.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still a huge fan of this miracle wax and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever stop being one, so BENEFIT better not discontinue this product,</li>
      <li>I use a moisturizer, apply this on top, then use powder or a light cream-based foundation.</li>
      <li>The instruction says to go \\&quot;over\\&quot; makeup, but I strongly disagree.</li>
      <li>It actually makes it look very nice and healthy</li>
      <li>My wife is using it and it is perfectly fine</li>
      <li>One good thing about this product is that you can use it anywhere on your body, and you wouldn&#x27;t believe how soft you can make your skin with it!</li>
      <li>my skin stay oil free longer.</li>
      <li>(The primary reason for my purchase.)&lt;br /&gt;Can be used under/over makeup or alone.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
      <li>It is still smooth just oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but overall is a great product.</li>
      <li>It can make my face smoothly.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I use it right, but one thing is for sure</li>
      <li>I use bare minerals makeup and it did not look good with this stuff.  </li>
      <li>In General, it is good.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to receive my Dr Feelgood because a friend of mine had it</li>
      <li>It even gives my skin a nice glow and my skin feels velvety soft afterwards.  </li>
      <li>This time it seems to be dryed out or old because it kind of crumbles or flakes when I apply it.  </li>
      <li>Actually it didn&#x27;t look like authentic product at all!</li>
      <li>It is a great product, but I think this is a little over price.</li>
      <li>morbidity aside, if there is something the cosmetics industry has done right - it&#x27;s Dr. Feelgood.</li>
      <li>and I need to keep searching for the right product.</li>
      <li>my face still looks very dry, some fine line even more visible in the afternoon.  </li>
      <li>However, the shipping is very fast, and no problem with this product.</li>
      <li>thank you very much.</li>
      <li>I did all the normal skin clean and moisture before applying it, however it balls up and gets flaky.</li>
      <li>I seem to always get a cracked area of skin around my nose and simply after using this stuff for a week it was gone and gave me a huge confidence boost!    </li>
      <li>Let your lotion settle into your skin first.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>I use it before or after makeup, but I don&#x27;t know the exact effect.</li>
      <li>However I gave it 3 stars because it is EXACTLY as described...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been told that 10 minutes was the ideal \\&quot;settling\\&quot; period, but just know that a little waiting before sealing your skin with Feelgood will never hurt the final presentation of your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this based on reviews that this was good for oily skin, and its not a bad product but my skin is far to oily for this everyday.</li>
      <li>I now get a matte, polished look, soft, moisturized skin, and no nasty little wrinkles around my eyes to spoil it :)</li>
      <li>At first I only used this on my skin on rare special occasions, until one day I realized</li>
      <li>On the down side, it smells like citronella and it can get kind if flakey.</li>
      <li>and I thought it would be fun to try something new.</li>
      <li>skin has gotten tad oily now that the weather&#x27;s hotter, so after I moisturize and Feelgood my face, I&#x27;ve returned to using a light dusting of baked/loose mineral powder as a cover-up, instead of my usual BB cream foundation+powder on top of this wax.</li>
      <li>Feeling of the skin with a BB cream and then, as if the effect is not too desirable!After wiping the skin is matte, but did not think that was so easy to use, such as advertising.</li>
      <li>I have large pores and oily skin</li>
      <li>I now use this daily because I&#x27;ve seen how it protects my skin from pollution and keeps the fine lines at bay.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really know how it works.</li>
      <li>As far as scent goes, I guess people don&#x27;t like the smell of fresh with a hint of lemon?</li>
      <li>Therefore I&#x27;ve never managed to get through a whole one..</li>
      <li>, what I mind is that they are charging so much for this</li>
      <li>If I didn&#x27;t wear makeup at all, I think I would actually really like this stuff.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this because I needed a long-wearing matte primer to prevent oily breakout and shine and this absolutely does the trick.</li>
      <li>so i buy it , i very like it.</li>
      <li>i really like this product and have been using it for years, but never bought it on line before.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t control oil very well though.</li>
      <li>An added benefit is its pore-reducing qualities - it really does minimize pores.</li>
      <li>I use this product everyday, I know what kind of product it is.</li>
      <li>I put it on top of my daily cream/sunscreen/powder, it makes my skin look and feel silky smooth though it does little to the pores.</li>
      <li>Also better at making my makeup last than the Urban Decay setting spray.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was more frustrated than disappointed when I opened the package. The Box was old and dirty. The tin was scratchy and rusty. When I removed the lid, it was even worse: It seemed the content had melted! A thin layer of oil floating on top! Actually it didn&#x27;t look like authentic product at all! I&#x27;m eager to share this bad experience here. Hope others don&#x27;t waste money on this item at this store again!</li>
    <li> I put it on top of my daily cream/sunscreen/powder, it makes my skin look and feel silky smooth though it does little to the pores.</li>
    <li> Wow. I have large pores and oily skin and this makes my skin look flawless. All I put over it was powder. Can&#x27;t recommend this enough.</li>
    <li> Great Stuff, But unfortunately the sponge supplied ends up breaking before you use it all - Therefore I&#x27;ve never managed to get through a whole one.. You end up getting half-way and having to by a new one.     I seem to always get a cracked area of skin around my nose and simply after using this stuff for a week it was gone and gave me a huge confidence boost!    One good thing about this product is that you can use it anywhere on your body, and you wouldn&#x27;t believe how soft you can make your skin with it! If it wasn&#x27;t so pricey I&#x27;d have lots of the stuff.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I needed a long-wearing matte primer to prevent oily breakout and shine and this absolutely does the trick. It may be a little thick and challenging to apply, but it makes your my skin so smooth and silky. An added benefit is its pore-reducing qualities - it really does minimize pores. Although the instructions say to apply on top of makeup, I don&#x27;t. I use a moisturizer, apply this on top, then use powder or a light cream-based foundation. It&#x27;s a little pricey but it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Now that I am in my late 40s, I can&#x27;t wear foundations anymore; they only seem to emphasize the small lines and creases around my eyes. I miss the polished look I get with a foundation, however, and Dr. Feelgood steps in to save the day! I now get a matte, polished look, soft, moisturized skin, and no nasty little wrinkles around my eyes to spoil it :)</li>
    <li> Great product - but don&#x27;t buy it online from Amazon. Received mine FAR past its expiration date (whenever that was - it wasn&#x27;t on the product). Product was so solid, I wondered if it was tampered with. Included applicator was obviously rotting away. Unusable, and a waste of money - had to throw it away. :&amp;lt; Highly suggest you buy this from either the store itself, or directly from the manufacturer here:  [...] . Only way to ensure premium quality of your shipment.</li>
    <li> I wear this product alone. It mattifies, evens out my skin, covers my pores, hides my blemishes, the works. It even gives my skin a nice glow and my skin feels velvety soft afterwards.  I am acne-prone, and this stuff does not cause any breakouts. I think it may even play a part in preventing them because it keeps my skin oil-free all day and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I don&#x27;t wear heavy makeup, and this product gives me a great look without making my skin look fake and cakey. On the down side, it smells like citronella and it can get kind if flakey. I find myself brushing flakes of it off my face and shirt after application. But I have tried a lot of products, and this one has been the best.</li>
    <li> Its a little pasty..can create a thin layer that does not feel right on the skin</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews here.  Unfortunately, I wasted my money.  I have tried this product both under and over my makeup and both have the same results.    I might as well have put vaseline on my face, it would have had the same effect (and cost less).  I use bare minerals makeup and it did not look good with this stuff.  If you rub your face AT ALL, you will immediately see a problem.  The mineral makeup sticks to this stuff and it clumps up on my skin.  If I didn&#x27;t wear makeup at all, I think I would actually really like this stuff.  However, this doesn&#x27;t correct any skin tone imperfections, so I won&#x27;t go without my foundation.</li>
    <li> After reading tons of reviews about the dr feelgood balm I decided I NEEDED it! Since I had an amazon gift card I decided to purchase it from amazon rather than making trip to Sephora. Well after using it about 3 or do times I just thought \\&quot; this s nothing like the way Benefit describes it or other people who have used it. So I decided to go to Sephora and heck it out. I tried the sample they have on display and was blown away on ow different it was! Not the same product at all!!!! Different color, different scent, different everything, different price!!!! It was cheaper at sephora! I purchased the real deal and after bringing it home and comparing the 2 I noticed the packaging is totally different even the sponge was different! Do not buy from here!!</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to using this product as the consultant stated it would help mattify my oily skin. My experience has been very different however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review: I would not purchase this product a second time because it doesn&#x27;t meet my needs. I was looking for something that would make my skin look and feel less oily throughout the day. However, by mid day my skin is oily again and I have to blot. Gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I have used it with/without moisturizer, over/under makeup and moisturizer, with no makeup/moisturizer, with only moisturizer and have found that if I reapply it the results are a little better; meaning that it will mattify the oil that is there already. But, I was looking for something that would work all day not something that I needed to reapply several times. Additionally, when reapplying it does become thick as you would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cute packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Good sponge.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth on the skin and to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;Does not appear to melt and travels well.&lt;br /&gt;Does not appear to make me break out more often.&lt;br /&gt;The sent is acceptable to me.&lt;br /&gt;A little does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Did not mattify my oily skin long term (6-8 hrs). (The primary reason for my purchase.)&lt;br /&gt;Can be used under/over makeup or alone.&lt;br /&gt;Even though my skin is still oily it does not feel weighed down or sticky. It is still smooth just oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that if I go without using this product and use the Urban Decay De-Slick Oil-Control Makeup Setting Spray 4 oz or the Urban Decay All Nighter Long-Lasting Makeup Setting Spray my skin stay oil free longer. I hope this review will help with your decision one way or the other.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I love this stuff.  Been using it for about 3 years now.  It&#x27;s great to keep away shiny forehead and shiny cheeks.  The only bad part is that if you put face cream on, you have to wait until the cream is soaked into your skin, otherwise it begins to permeate the applying pad and once you&#x27;re halfway through the product, the pad picks up the product in chunks and makes it harder to apply.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m shocked by all the bad reviews of this product but I&#x27;m mucho biased. I ADORE this product and will keep this as my personal and not-so-secret-anymore beauty tip until the day I die. In fact, I want them to use this on my face for my wake, unless I decide to become cremated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All morbidity aside, if there is something the cosmetics industry has done right - it&#x27;s Dr. Feelgood. Ever since my friend introduced this product to me I&#x27;ve been hooked. At first I only used this on my skin on rare special occasions, until one day I realized it actually did \\&quot;benefit\\&quot; my skin unlike most cosmetics products. I now use this daily because I&#x27;ve seen how it protects my skin from pollution and keeps the fine lines at bay. (Believe me, I know how this sounds - way too good to be true.) But hey, if the sun is going to bear down on my face, whether for a moment or a full-on beach day, and try to dry it out and create new little wrinkles, I want this stuff on my face (over my moisturizing sunscreen) as an added layer of protection to slow time. The instruction says to go \\&quot;over\\&quot; makeup, but I strongly disagree. I&#x27;ve tried it every which way and have found that it works BEST when over moisturization/sunscreen and UNDER my makeup. Sounds like a whole heck of crap on your face, but for some reason it works on my complexion and doesn&#x27;t look heavy. You should know that this is NOT a moisturizer (I read a complaint or two that this makes your skin dry) which is why moisturizer should go on before you \\&quot;seal\\&quot; your skin with this stuff. (By the way, sunscreen is VERY important if you&#x27;re going to be out in the sun even for less than half an hour, and should go on before Feelgood.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and damaged enlarged pores and this stuff doesn&#x27;t break me out. It&#x27;s amazing. My pores really do look smaller. As far as scent goes, I guess people don&#x27;t like the smell of fresh with a hint of lemon? There&#x27;s definitely a scent of waxiness but it&#x27;s far from offending, IMHO. This product allows me to go out without makeup - I just wear moisturizer or sunscreen under it. Feelgood&#x27;s specialty is definitely the nude face/au naturale look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit, I almost refrained from writing an official review on this product because I wanted to keep my awesome results to myself, but my sense of duty to pay this beauty tip forward as my friend did to me kept nagging at me.  I need to keep up the good mojo if I want to continue hearing about beauty secrets that work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-March 10, 2013 UPDATE-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so humbled to see that my review of this product actually helped people! I&#x27;m still a huge fan of this miracle wax and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever stop being one, so BENEFIT better not discontinue this product, ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been meaning to share a tip for those of you new to makeup or putting multiple layers of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; on your face (including this product): If you aren&#x27;t in a hurry, after you moisturize/SPF your face, wait a few minutes before putting on Dr. Feelgood. Let your lotion settle into your skin first. I&#x27;ve always been told that 10 minutes was the ideal \\&quot;settling\\&quot; period, but just know that a little waiting before sealing your skin with Feelgood will never hurt the final presentation of your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has gotten tad oily now that the weather&#x27;s hotter, so after I moisturize and Feelgood my face, I&#x27;ve returned to using a light dusting of baked/loose mineral powder as a cover-up, instead of my usual BB cream foundation+powder on top of this wax. It&#x27;s been working beautifully...</li>
    <li> i apply this everytime before make up, it will cause some break out at my nose area after application but overall is a great product. It&#x27;s invisible and smooth, also controls excessive facial oil.</li>
    <li> This was not an authentic Benefits product.  I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and thought I would save some money by ordering this on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The label on the package was incorrect, the container itself was different and the smell of the product was off.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a bad product however not for me. I don&#x27;t see the effect to the pore and skin tone, perhaps because this product is not for Asian skin? I did all the normal skin clean and moisture before applying it, however it balls up and gets flaky. It doesn&#x27;t control oil very well though.</li>
    <li> This was another product that I tried and did not like.</li>
    <li> It different from the real one in some points. It also a little bit oil and like a fake one.</li>
    <li> Looks good with no foundation at all, my skin has a smoother appearance. I mostly use this as a primer under liquid or cream foundation, works better than the drugstore and department store primers I bought before Dr. Feelgood.&lt;br /&gt; This shouldn&#x27;t flake or ball up, if so you are using too much.&lt;br /&gt; Also better at making my makeup last than the Urban Decay setting spray.</li>
    <li> I heard a lot about Dr.feelgood before I bought it, and was really curious about how it works.  After try it, I found out it works sort of like Estee Lauder&#x27;s Pore Minimizing Skin Refinisher by hiding the pores and reducing the oily look.  it can be very good for the \\&quot;nude look\\&quot;.  My skin is the very dry type. And I don&#x27;t like to wear foundation, so I just use Dr.feelgood after moisturizer and before some loos power. I was hoping the vitamine C it  contains could help moistening my thirsty skin but it actually can&#x27;t. my face still looks very dry, some fine line even more visible in the afternoon.  I don&#x27;t know if I use it right, but one thing is for sure, compare with Estee Lauder&#x27;s Pore Minimizing Skin Refinisher, it is a bit too dry.  However, if you like to go out with nude look skin sometimes, this should be a pretty good skin refinisher.</li>
    <li> Received the it,I want to die,what is this!it  really let me too disappointed, if I can send picture you will to see it is a shit but not Benefit! It has only half the amount, and it is very sticky and dirty, obviously, it is not  the real thing, if  I can I will return it  but I&#x27;m in China now,hope nobudy be fooled future .</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re sorry, but now I evaluate the product. Very good product, the long-awaited. Good quality, very suitable for my friend!</li>
    <li> I wanted this product to be amazing, however I have to admit its just OK. I can not use it on the T-zone area (where my skin is very oily), because my face becomes extremely shiny. I can only use this after I apply makeup and only on my cheeks (the very dry area of my face). It actually makes it look very nice and healthy, it gives it this natural glow. I can only use a little bit of it. Also, I cant use the sponge (it picks up too much of the already applied makeup), i have to use my fingers to gently pad the product, to make sure it doesn&#x27;t make me look like my cheeks are sweating LOL! Little amount goes a long way. So again, it doesn&#x27;t minimize my pores but it makes my cheeks glow and look healthy, like a nice highlighter.</li>
    <li> Is not DR. Feelgood inside.</li>
    <li> It is very skinny and smells very good. It can make my face smoothly. I love it and plan to buy it again~</li>
    <li> Benefit Cosmetics Dr. Feelgood does is feelgood. That is really perfect feeling. It makes my skin smooth and soft. So I like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on reviews that this was good for oily skin, and its not a bad product but my skin is far to oily for this everyday. However it does smelly really nice, and is great to use to smooth out lines from foundation.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know how it works. I have my makeup on and also Dr.Feelgood. My makeup still drops off and my face feels oily.&lt;br /&gt;It is not what I heard of.</li>
    <li> Makes me look good! I like it. I wanna buy it again. Makes me look good! I like it. I wanna buy it again.</li>
    <li> In General, it is good. Your skin may look more smooth, but sometimes it makes my skin a little dry in autumn.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how to use it to show its benefits. I use it before or after makeup, but I don&#x27;t know the exact effect. However, the shipping is very fast, and no problem with this product.</li>
    <li> the goods past very fast to my school&lt;br /&gt;it is useful and helpful before you make up and it smelt good</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fake. Totally different from the one I bought from cosmetic department. And it was shipped from Honkong, not USA. I use this product everyday, I know what kind of product it is. The fake one I bought from this shop is with different outlooking, different smell and different property, it&#x27;s just oil with disgusting smell!&lt;br /&gt;I never imagine there would be fake product in Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;I waste my money and feel disappointed.</li>
    <li> it was very good and have so many benefits for healthy so i buy it , i very like it.</li>
    <li> i bought 4 of the denefit cosmetics DR feel good from here send for my friends as a gift. it,s so fake, so embrassed.</li>
    <li> nice i like it. willing to purchase next time. thank you very much. as the as i expect. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> My wife is using it and it is perfectly fine, she has sensitive skin and has no problem about it.</li>
    <li> Feeling of the skin with a BB cream and then, as if the effect is not too desirable!After wiping the skin is matte, but did not think that was so easy to use, such as advertising.</li>
    <li> I like it really good, i like it very much. And I believe  Tissot is a good brand. Buy it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  After I apply my moisture, then I apply this primer.  My foundation goes on very smooth and even, I get a nice dewy look to my skin.  It does not cake up.  It is great for oily skin.  When I am in a rush, sometimes I just apply the Benefit without my foundation, and I still get that nice even tone look.</li>
    <li> Makes my face sweat 😒</li>
    <li> it is nice to order it online.&lt;br /&gt;I went to a shopping mall to compare it to the one in store.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is same.</li>
    <li> It is a great product, but I think this is a little over price. You can find other lipbalm in a lower price~</li>
    <li> I never buy expensive makeup but I liked the description of what this product does and I thought it would be fun to try something new. I have dry skin, red spots, shiny areas and fine lines so I thought this would help. To my disappointment I can&#x27;t see a difference at all. However I gave it 3 stars because it is EXACTLY as described...weightless, smooth, very little scent, non-irritating to sensitive skin, easy to apply, and will probably last a really long time. A little of this balm goes a long way which is always a good thing. Plus it comes in a cute tin that I can carry in my purse, perfect size to bring on the go. As I said above, I really can&#x27;t tell the difference no matter how much I put on. Maybe I need to not give up and try it at different times of the day or maybe before I put on my concealer. I might go natural one day and only apply this to my bare skin to see if it does anything to my face when there is less stuff on it. People love Benefit makeup so maybe this just isn&#x27;t meant for my skin type and I need to keep searching for the right product. My main complaint with this product is that it is far to expensive and absolutely NOT worth $30. I don&#x27;t even mind that I bought a product that doesn&#x27;t work for me, what I mind is that they are charging so much for this and it is a rip off. Please lower the price!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive my Dr Feelgood because a friend of mine had it and I fell in love, but when I ordered it the case was all beat up and it looked used! It was in a horrible condition, looked as if it was sitting in the sun for years! I will be returning this ASAP l!  You should buy it from some where else honestly. I wasted my time and money. Bad seller</li>
    <li> There was a seller called Coco Bella sold the expired products. The price is quite low, 8.45$ for each. But the ones I received has been expired several months ago. Therefore, I have to return them.&lt;br /&gt;You should be careful if you choose the low priced one. Make sure to check the code for the expire date.&lt;br /&gt;So BAD! It is unbelievable that they can sell the expired things to customers.</li>
    <li> i really like this product and have been using it for years, but never bought it on line before.  This time it seems to be dryed out or old because it kind of crumbles or flakes when I apply it.  I would not buy it on line again</li>
    <li> the Cosmetics is fake!!!&lt;br /&gt;the benefit shoppe said this cosmetics Dr. Feelgood is fake!!!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s different quality from cosmetics which I bought from Benefit shoppe</li>
