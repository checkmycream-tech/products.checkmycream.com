### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I even limit myself on what types of products I use because I like my skin to look flawless.  </li>
      <li>It contained gold and caviar extract, which sounded quite impressive.  </li>
      <li>, this is a very good ingredient in skin care products.  </li>
      <li>If I could get a life-time supply of this serum gratis, I&#x27;d be happy to keep using it.</li>
      <li>I find serums to be a great option.  </li>
      <li>a good serum.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like good moisturizers</li>
      <li>Basically, this has a nice feel on the skin because it has a good slip agent</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is amazing serum</li>
      <li>1 oz pump comes in very attractive bottle with golden color and nice, calligraphy like letter A on top of the plastic cover.  </li>
      <li>but if a product is nice, I&#x27;m going to say so.</li>
      <li>The kind that squirt all over your mirror.</li>
      <li>But I have to be honest, I am a bargain-shopping kind of girl</li>
      <li>Kind of like it&#x27;s a \\&quot;ghost\\&quot; product, kind of there</li>
      <li>B008AVLR8U Boots No7 Protect &amp; Perfect Intense Beauty Serum 1 fl oz</li>
      <li>I really, really liked this product until it broke me out.</li>
      <li>and my face looked nice.</li>
      <li>This serum comes in a nice bottle that holds just one ounce of product, and for the price, it&#x27;s just prohibitive.  </li>
      <li>I loved the easy to use pump application and slim bottle packaging and it looks decadent sitting on my bathroom counter.</li>
      <li>The scent was very strong, almost perfumed rather than just scented.</li>
      <li>think this product is a nice moisturizer that does make my skin look better and</li>
      <li>like Department Store products, like Elizabeth Arden, and Kiels, but was hoping the AINHOA products might be more cost effective and have better results.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is pleasant, mild and very light.</li>
      <li>It is also very smooth.  </li>
      <li>I was super happy today when I was mistakenly wished a happy 25th birthday instead of my 25 year old co-worker.  </li>
      <li>but I am really satisfied with my serum</li>
      <li>just more expensive.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Personally, I like the Ainhoa Senskin line better than this \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; gold and caviar line.  </li>
      <li>gifts :)</li>
      <li>I have to say that I have been pleased with the feel of this on my skin and while it does have a scent to it</li>
      <li>Oil of Olay is a better bet for your money.</li>
      <li>It did not irritate my skin like most moisturizers do.</li>
      <li>I am hoping to regain some of that lovely dewiness to my skin that I had in my 20s and is fading now that I am in my 30s.  </li>
      <li>This also contains parabens, which many people try to avoid because of health concerns.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Serums tent to be absorb better by then skin, while moisturizers tend to sit on top of the skin to provide moisture.</li>
      <li>Not my Meaningful Beauty, or Clinique, or Noxema, or Cetaphil, or Vaseline.</li>
      <li>and I find serums to work better for me than moisturizers.</li>
      <li>:-)).</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find it any more skin-tightening or moisturizing than others we&#x27;ve used, and at $80 per ounce</li>
      <li>/&gt;First off, my face looked a bit more radiant after application</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m a bit impressed that this is used in many European spas.</li>
      <li>The texture is smooth and leaves a nice glow on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The magic ingredients in this product are gold and caviar, which sounds impressive enough.  </li>
      <li>But then, that might be just because I&#x27;m more of a down-to-earth, get-out-into-the-outdoors type of person.</li>
      <li>; it smells nice, it goes on smoothly and was hydrating.</li>
      <li>and when you pump out the lotion, it is a beautiful clear color with lots of gold in it.  </li>
      <li>The product description goes on and on about how great it is for sensitive skin, so I selected it in the hope that I would find some new, great skin care</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d love to say this product works wonders, but from my experience it didn&#x27;t do anything to help reduce the fine lines I have around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>so I decided that following that tightening needed to be followed up by a very good moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Its cheap as dirt and is found in most cheaper products.&lt;br /&gt;cellulose gum- thickener (emulsifier)&lt;br /&gt;polyacrylamide-</li>
      <li>The serum itself is very hydrating, and it does a good job of locking in</li>
      <li>/&gt;This did not have the chemically smell to it, just a very light clean scent.  </li>
      <li>and it spread easily and soaked into my skin and kept it from drying out.</li>
      <li>I did not expect any particular response to any of the lotions I&#x27;ve tried, as I tend to use good moisturizers to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I get A LOT of really fine lines when I do that,</li>
      <li>I was SUPER excited to get this product to review - after all, what woman doesn&#x27;t want to try luxury face products!  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes either, so that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
      <li>and I did like the light consistency of the product</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have any irritation and my face was smooth and hydrated after using.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely enjoy this product and make recommendations for it for women who like to take an axceptional care of their skin.  </li>
      <li>Water is followed by propylene glycol, a slip agent that is probably why this goes on so smoothly.  </li>
      <li>This lotion goes on smoothly and feels light, I didn&#x27;t notice any perfume smell that another reviewer mentioned,</li>
      <li>thought this serum felt nice on my skin and definitely gave it a nice finish</li>
      <li>but it really wasn&#x27;t any more impressive than what I pick up from MAC, Oil of Olay&#x27;s Regenerist or the other brands I have tried at Sephora.  </li>
      <li>I was anxious to try this product, because gold and caviar extracts sounds wonderful.</li>
      <li>And the serum itself has a nice texture, &amp; the scent is normal.</li>
      <li>Product is originally made in Barcelona,</li>
      <li>I love the dispenser, it&#x27;s nice enough to leave out on the bathroom counter.</li>
      <li>bottle is nice and it has a pump that gives a good amount without waste.  </li>
      <li>applied it all over my face and neck, giving special attention to around the eyes and mouth.</li>
      <li>it stands, I will happily return to my roughly $24</li>
      <li>The packaging was sexy, but I didn&#x27;t really think this did anything for me.  </li>
      <li>first I thought it was fine.</li>
      <li>but it wore off quickly.</li>
      <li>I am 49 years old and have  good skin for a person of my age, thanks to a non-smoking and non-tanning or sunbathing lifestyle.  </li>
      <li>comes in a very pretty slim pump bottle</li>
      <li>(that also happens to be pretty cheap for the manufacturer to purchase).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a very nice linen scent, goes on well, and is otherwise a pretty decent product with no real negative marks against it.  </li>
      <li>love to splurge and pamper myself by trying out new products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unless you are just dying of curiosity and have bucks to blow, then save your money and buy a product that really will help with fine lines.....something with alpha or beta hydroxy in the ingredients list.</li>
      <li>I have used other AINHOA products that I thought were more effective but they were also pretty pricey.</li>
      <li>first impression of this serum is what a clean and fresh smell it has.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a little bit tacky and seems to give my concealer something more to stick to than just my smooth skin, so I get better coverage with the concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;titanium dioxide- thickener, too low a concentration here to be effective as a sunscreen&lt;</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;titanium dioxide- thickener, too low a concentration here to be effective as a sunscreen&lt;</li>
      <li>It has a golden pearly sheen</li>
      <li>The combination of the products makes my face like young and sexy and dewy.  </li>
      <li>, I rarely use hand cream or body lotion because I don&#x27;t like the way they feel and the perfume smells irritate me.  </li>
      <li>, I can&#x27;t see spending this kind of money for a product that only \\&quot;compliments\\&quot; your night &amp; day moisturizers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been experiencing a dryness on my face that no moisturizer has been able to correct so far.</li>
      <li>Worth the indulgence and the dewey results.</li>
      <li>OK, the two most hyped products in here don&#x27;t have much support regarding making your skin younger.  </li>
      <li>I honestly like the product for it ease of application and the non-greasy feeling left on your skin, but could not justify the price for a product that doesn&#x27;t seem to work as advertised.</li>
      <li>Now granted, I have very sensitive skin with pores that clog easily.</li>
      <li>On the nights that I didn&#x27;t use it, my skin felt kind of dry.  </li>
      <li>After two months, I honestly couldn&#x27;t spot a single difference or improvement in my skin since adding this to my routine.  </li>
      <li>I did find that the first week my skin went through a \\&quot;reaction\\&quot; period where I had increased pimples in the cheek areas.</li>
      <li>Immediate, stellar results with this product.  </li>
      <li>what I can attest to is that my skin most definitely feels refreshed, and hydrated.  </li>
      <li>I use topical treatments for my skin issues and can manage to keep it under control most of the time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;d love to say this product works wonders, but from my experience it didn&#x27;t do anything to help reduce the fine lines I have around my eyes.  I used it in the mornings several times after washing my face.  I applied it just like the instructions said, but it made my face feel very tight and I could not feel any moisturizing effect whatsoever.  I had to keep smearing lotion on my face to relieve the tightness.  I suppose maybe it was meant to work by tightening the skin, but it just made it very uncomfortable for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients list really meant nothing to me.  Caviar extract????  Gold????  I&#x27;m sorry, but I just don&#x27;t see how any of that can make a difference worth paying 79 dollars for a 1 oz. bottle.  I think the high price is to pay for the gold which is selling for $1,667.27/oz. as of this writing.  I did see a very small fleck of gold on my forehead but I picked it off.  Sparkles are nice I guess, but I&#x27;m not really interested in a \\&quot;sparkly\\&quot; face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you are just dying of curiosity and have bucks to blow, then save your money and buy a product that really will help with fine lines.....something with alpha or beta hydroxy in the ingredients list.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while and I must say, I am not particularly impressed.  Since my background is as a bench scientist, I tend to be somewhat skeptical about most hyped beauty products.  And, since I now manage the chemical side of things, I tend to look at ingredient lists to determine what the ingredients are doing for my skin.  So my assessment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed any changes after daily use of this for a couple of weeks.  The magic ingredients in this product are gold and caviar, which sounds impressive enough.  I can find no supporting evidence for the benefits of gold in a serum product.  The only thing the gold does is look pretty (there are shiny flakes in the serum) and possibly give you an allergic reaction.  Nor could I find much scientific support for the use of caviar in facial products (other than press releases and celebrity endorsements).  OK, the two most hyped products in here don&#x27;t have much support regarding making your skin younger.  What about the rest of the ingredients?  Well the rest of the ingredients are pretty average (and cheap and found in drugstore products costing under 20 dollars).  Water is followed by propylene glycol, a slip agent that is probably why this goes on so smoothly.  Basically, this has a nice feel on the skin because it has a good slip agent (that also happens to be pretty cheap for the manufacturer to purchase).  This also contains parabens, which many people try to avoid because of health concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are:&lt;br /&gt;Water&lt;br /&gt;propylene glycol- a \\&quot;slip agent\\&quot; helps the product spread across your skin, may help deliver chemicals into the cells.  Nothing fancy here, fairly common ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;Biosaccharide gum-1 - a moisturizing agent,  type of sugar&lt;br /&gt;polysorbate 20 (tween 20) - an emulsifier&lt;br /&gt;glycerine- humectants (moisturizes), this is a very good ingredient in skin care products.

Basically, you can get a better formulated product at the drug store for a lot less money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now. But I find it difficult to really vouch for its sense purpose, it is a little vague. Does it lift and tighten my skin? Well yes, it does tighten my face and if I didn&#x27;t also use a moisturizer it would really dry my skin out. Living in windy Wyoming my real battle is with dry skin so perhaps this is not a result I should go for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As far as regenerating my skin I really can&#x27;t say at this point, I will add that it does seem to work well with my other facial products and that no breakouts or rashes have occurred due to incompatible chemical reactions - a problem I have experienced in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a little research and despite the claims on the bottle for its use of gold, reports do not sustain any claims for  nutritive value to skin via gold. I am inclined to believe this and feel that the gold only serves to give a lovely iridescent sheen to the serum and it possibly does add a bit of shine when light hits your skin, but again, not that big of a deal. So the gold probably just helps to jack up the price of this item. I can see where the caviar might actually serve with some nutritive value but I have found other products that cost half the price that work just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love to splurge and pamper myself by trying out new products. Admittedly I am not as disappointed with this product as I have been with others. It works well with other products and is not offensive to sensitive skin. But for my money I am not sure I have anything that I couldn&#x27;t have done with out. Kind of like it&#x27;s a \\&quot;ghost\\&quot; product, kind of there but maybe not.</li>
    <li> I have used the Luxe Gold facial Serum as recommended every night for approximately 3 weeks. I love the dispenser, it&#x27;s nice enough to leave out on the bathroom counter. The fragrance is pleasant, mild and very light. The texture is smooth and leaves a nice glow on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it all over my face and neck, giving special attention to around the eyes and mouth. However, I found it very disappointing that after 3 weeks, I saw no change. I honestly like the product for it ease of application and the non-greasy feeling left on your skin, but could not justify the price for a product that doesn&#x27;t seem to work as advertised.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to be able to sample this AINHOA Luxe Gold Facial Serum with gold and caviar.  I have to say I was thinking gold and caviar?  On my face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes in a very pretty slim pump bottle and when you pump out the lotion, it is a beautiful clear color with lots of gold in it.  Be sure to pump out just a little, I pumped to hard and had to much for my face and neck the first time.  This lotion goes on smoothly and feels light, I didn&#x27;t notice any perfume smell that another reviewer mentioned, to me this was pretty fragrance-less.  I didn&#x27;t have any irritation and my face was smooth and hydrated after using.  The gold dissolved into my skin, I didn&#x27;t notice any huge changes but have only used this a few days.  I like it and will continue to use it but do think this is overpriced for what it is.  I have used other AINHOA products that I thought were more effective but they were also pretty pricey.</li>
    <li> I like this product!  It&#x27;s working very well for me.  I can tell a difference!&lt;br /&gt;My skin gets irritated and turns red with vitamin C and retinol.  This, however, does not irritate my skin or cause any redness at all. Of course everyone is different and sampling a product before buying is ALWAYS nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It goes on a little slimy- it reminds me a bit of Kiehl&#x27;s marine serum in the way it feels.  It has a golden pearly sheen to it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day on problem areas, once a day on the rest of my face.  I have very white, generally normal skin with some fine age lines.  It has decreased those and the firming around my eyes is great when I&#x27;ve used it when I&#x27;ve woke up after sleeping with my face smushed into a pillow- I get A LOT of really fine lines when I do that, and this really helps those settle down and firm up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I don&#x27;t notice any bad smell, or really much of a scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This is a serum.  I use it under my moisturizer.  It goes in, like I said, a bit slimy, but it dries quickly and leaves skin feeling soft with no residue.  THEN I put my moisturizer on.  I&#x27;ve been using a gel moisturizer and it works especially well with gels I&#x27;ve noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is nice and it has a pump that gives a good amount without waste.  I would put this on my list of skincare favorites personally and will look for it again.  It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes either, so that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
    <li> When I had cleared all the funny effects of the first AINHOA I tried - the parchment like skin- I started to put this one on the back of my hands again to test for an allergic reaction and then took off my Pandora bracelet so it wouldn&#x27;t get any of it on the beads.  I did start to wonder, \\&quot;Why, why would I risk this again?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did not have the chemically smell to it, just a very light clean scent.  It has a gel-like texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this a couple of times a day for a week to ten days, I have to say that my skin is amazingly soft.  It is also very smooth.  This is an effect I can both feel and see.  I did not expect any particular response to any of the lotions I&#x27;ve tried, as I tend to use good moisturizers to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the claim about wrinkles?  I don&#x27;t have any because I have always followed my 2nd grade teacher&#x27;s orders to, \\&quot;Stop frowning or you will get wrinkles.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is amazing serum but it is way too expensive for me to use it in regular daily life.  I like good moisturizers but I especially like good ones that cost about half of what this one does.</li>
    <li> The packaging was sexy, but I didn&#x27;t really think this did anything for me.  The gold strikes me as gimmicky (seriously, how much gold is really gong to be in something for this price?), as does the caviar (seriously: it&#x27;s just left out on the counter, with no refrigeration).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very nice linen scent, goes on well, and is otherwise a pretty decent product with no real negative marks against it.  But it&#x27;s just not one I&#x27;d recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have never used any facial moisturizers before trying this product and I would never have tried it if I hadn&#x27;t been able to get it through the Vine program.  I have never been a fan of moisturizing, I rarely use hand cream or body lotion because I don&#x27;t like the way they feel and the perfume smells irritate me.  I do like Jergens lotions and I will use that but that&#x27;s the only moisturizer I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have notice that the elasticity in my skin is diminishing and my face is getting wrinkly so I was happy to have the chance to try this expensive serum.  I have to say that I have been pleased with the feel of this on my skin and while it does have a scent to it I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all.  I guess you&#x27;re supposed to put this on before bed but I use it in the morning instead. And I like the texture of this product under my concealer, it&#x27;s a little bit tacky and seems to give my concealer something more to stick to than just my smooth skin, so I get better coverage with the concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I think this product is making me look younger? Well, someone held the door for me the other day and called me \\&quot;Miss\\&quot; instead of Ma&#x27;am...does that count?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product is a nice moisturizer that does make my skin look better and my make-up go on better and it doesn&#x27;t have an irritating smell to it.  So, I do like it.  But I have to be honest, I am a bargain-shopping kind of girl and I would never spend big bucks on any beauty product, probably not even if I won the lottery.  If I could get a life-time supply of this serum gratis, I&#x27;d be happy to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I have acne skin and I find serums to work better for me than moisturizers. Serums tent to be absorb better by then skin, while moisturizers tend to sit on top of the skin to provide moisture. I have to be careful with certain moisturizers because they increase oil levels in my skin creating more acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression of this serum is what a clean and fresh smell it has. The serum is clear to milky white with flecks of gold that illuminate and shine. It is very pretty and expensive looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying it to the skin made my skin extra soft and manageable. It did not irritate my skin like most moisturizers do. I did find that the first week my skin went through a \\&quot;reaction\\&quot; period where I had increased pimples in the cheek areas. I google some of the ingredients and found that gold can be an irritant on certain skin. However, the \\&quot;reaction\\&quot; period died in about two weeks, and my skin overall was clearer, brighter, and nicer to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that applying too much product made my skin feel like it was going to crack, because it felt \\&quot;hardened\\&quot; on my skin. However, applying a small amount and messaging it on the skin using circular strokes provided a luxurious touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not heard of the brand AINHOA because this serum but I am really satisfied with my serum and I will continue to use it until my bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> I used this once and after reading the other reviews I was too scared to use it again. It didn&#x27;t do anything negative to my face when I used it but I didn&#x27;t want to take any chances and use it again.</li>
    <li> I guess I expected more from this product because of the price. I will say that two weeks after I began using it, I started using the Purity skin toner as well and at that time I saw an improvement in the texture of my skin. Perhaps it needs the toner to work well. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, I was just hoping to see a difference of some sort in my oily skin.</li>
    <li> LUXE GOLD Facial Serum claims it gives your skin regenerative and moisturizing properties. I used it for three weeks just to see how well it did and I did like the light consistency of the product and it spread easily and soaked into my skin and kept it from drying out. I was not a fan of the scent as it was a bit off putting but it wore off quickly. I loved the easy to use pump application and slim bottle packaging and it looks decadent sitting on my bathroom counter. I could never afford this on a regular basis but it was a pleasure to see how a higher end product works vs. my usual drugstore creams by Loreal.</li>
    <li> I was excited for the opportunity to sample and review one of the high end facial products but that quickly turned to disappointment.  I do not have sensitive skin but one use and I had red blotches across my forehead. The scent was very strong, almost perfumed rather than just scented. Why is that even needed on a facial product? I&#x27;ll continue to try the products on my hands to use them up but this is not a product i would ever pay for or recommend. Oil of Olay is a better bet for your money.</li>
    <li> I use moisturizer regularly but do not use a serum. I find that my skin is hydrated enough with a moisturizer. This \\&quot;luxury\\&quot; serum seems a bit gimmicky with its gold flakes, but I find that, after a week&#x27;s use, my skin has become a bit more vibrant. The serum itself is very hydrating, and it does a good job of locking in moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the serum first, let it soak in a bit, and then cover with moisturizer. It seems to be working pretty well. As far as the price goes, though, I can&#x27;t say that this product is revolutionary enough to merit such a high price tag.</li>
    <li> This product has a lot of hype in its description: Luxe, Caviar, Gold... Not to forget the price tag which is definitely \\&quot;luxe\\&quot;. So it would be somewhat reasonable to expect to actually see a difference after using this serum. However, at least for me it did not result in any changes - it is just a serum as many others, or: as many other cheaper ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, my face looked a bit more radiant after application but I think this was only due to some visibly iridescent ingredient in the fluid which probably possesses some light-reflective quality (if this is real gold all the way, there must be a lot of it in there :-)). Secondly, my skin felt a bit sticky afterwards and also tight and uncomfortably tingly (I have sensitive skin, maybe that&#x27;s why).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall l I fail to see anything special in it nor did it feel particularly good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it stands, I will happily return to my roughly $24 [[ASIN:B008AVLR8U Boots No7 Protect &amp; Perfect Intense Beauty Serum 1 fl oz (30 ml)]] which at least for my skin feels gentler and is absorbed into the skin faster and without stickiness.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical about this product and all that it promised.  It is quite pricey (at least for me) compared to my usual go to moisturizer, Olay Total Effects.  I&#x27;ve been using it now off and on for about a month and I can say that I definitely feel a difference when I do use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product recommends cleansing your skin then using it as part of your nightly routine.  In order to really see how it worked every evening that I used this product I didn&#x27;t use my moisturizer even though it recommended using it in conjunction with a night cream.  A little does go a long way, and the serum is kind of like a clear liquid gel with miniscule gold sparkly particles.  I don&#x27;t know if it is actually gold or not, and was a bit afraid to use it at first because of that because I have such sensitive skin, but I have to say that I loved the way my skin felt when I woke up in the morning.  My skin looked fresh, and it was super soft.  On the nights that I didn&#x27;t use it, my skin felt kind of dry.  I tried this rotation a couple of times and my results were the same each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it do all that it says it does?  I don&#x27;t know that it regenerative, and will help eliminate wrinkles, or if it has lifting effects since I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month, but what I can attest to is that my skin most definitely feels refreshed, and hydrated.  So for that aspect alone I highly recommend this product.  Only time will tell if it lives up to all of it&#x27;s other promises.  As I said earlier, it&#x27;s not cheap so I don&#x27;t know if it is something that I will continue with...maybe I will be asking for this for Christmas and my Birthday gifts :)</li>
    <li> I just celebrated another one of those decade birthdays, so I was definitely interested when I saw this Luxe Gold Facial Serum available in the Vine program, as I would not normally spend that much money on a facial product myself.  It contained gold and caviar extract, which sounded quite impressive.  The description stated the serum offered \\&quot;regenerative and moisturizing properties\\&quot; and even slowed down the aging process.  It was recommended to use at night after facial cleansing.  So, after washing my face, I applied the serum to my face and neck.  Following this, my skin felt \\&quot;tight\\&quot; and actually started peeling a little around the mouth area, which certainly made me question its \\&quot;moisturizing properties\\&quot;.  I looked on the Internet and discovered that serums are usually followed by a cream or lotion.  So I started applying lotion after the serum.  That helped the dryness.  However, after using the serum daily for a period of time now I, unfortunately, have not noticed any visual results.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I was SUPER excited to get this product to review - after all, what woman doesn&#x27;t want to try luxury face products!  Here&#x27;s the skinny though: I have normal skin (not oily, not dry) and my skin tends to be a bit sensitive, and I, unfortunately, could not use this product.  When I tried this gold facial serum, my face started peeling within a day or two...so I stopped using it.  I was hoping it was NOT this product: so I tried it again: again it peeled.  I held off a few weeks, my skin was completely normal albeit my normal slightly sensitive: so I tried again, and the peeling came back: it was almost like my face was shedding an outer layer.  NOT something I desired or expected as a result of using this facial serum: so I stopped using it.  You may not get the same results, it may be great for you, but those with normal and sensitive skin like mine, I&#x27;d expect might have the same results...disappointed, but there it is.</li>
    <li> I will admit that I am very careful about taking care of my skin.  I even limit myself on what types of products I use because I like my skin to look flawless.  Until now, I have not heard of the AINHOA brand.  This product/brand is apparently offered to guests staying at the high end hotels.  Product is originally made in Barcelona, Spain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first look, this serum lists the following active ingredients: caviar and gold.  The product itself is named Luxe Gold. 1 oz pump comes in very attractive bottle with golden color and nice, calligraphy like letter A on top of the plastic cover.  Serum has regenerative and nutritive properties as well as lifting effect.  Gold, which is one of the ingredients gives skin luminocity and brilliance.  Although I typically use serum both in the morning and night, this one is recommended only for nightime use.  It can be applied to face and neck.  Same line also offers day &amp; night cream, eye essence cream and facial mask.  I absolutely enjoy this product and make recommendations for it for women who like to take an axceptional care of their skin.  This product will make you feel as if you are Cleopatra.</li>
    <li> I live in Texas and I spend a lot of time outdoors, so I must take into consideration that how this Luxe Gold reacts on my skin now--in the dry and colder temperatures of wintertime--will be totally different two-three months from now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad product, but I don&#x27;t see any obvious results after applying it, especially since it is supposed to be applied at night.  When I look in the mirror in the morning I don&#x27;t see any changes in my skin; then I wash my face and apply something else...  It is suggested that this product be applied only at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What concerns me is the way it goes on tacky / sticky.  It dries quickly and loses its stickiness in the low humidity of Winter, but I don&#x27;t think this product will be pleasant-feeling in our Summer humidity.  Also, it does have a fragrance--my cats don&#x27;t like it, but I&#x27;m sure the bees and some other insects will find it attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I like the Ainhoa Senskin line better than this \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; gold and caviar line.  But then, that might be just because I&#x27;m more of a down-to-earth, get-out-into-the-outdoors type of person.</li>
    <li> I have used this twice now and have decided to stop. The reason? I&#x27;m getting these little whiteheads around my eyes. It&#x27;s disconcerting. Now granted, I have very sensitive skin with pores that clog easily. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the gold or the caviar but something is not meshing with the skin on my eyelids and under my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought it was fine. I put some on my fingers and was tickled to see the shiny gold flecks. The cream serum was drippy; when applied it was sticky like egg white on your skin. But once it dried, my skin was VERY soft to the touch and my face looked nice. But after the second day, the whiteheads appeared and I immediately stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely not recommend this to those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t decide which I like more, this or the Whitess Caviar, but with EITHER of these you cannot go wrong. Because the line is so high end and quality, you can use sparingly to make it last and it is also a good base for makeup wearers. It helps restore skin that is looking a little dull and I also recommend putting a few squirts in a container so you can apply it throughout the day, especially in the winter when your skin gets very dry, or in the summer when you have to wash your face so often and freshen up. Like Whitess, a drop covers your entire face and you feel like a princess once you apply it. Worth the indulgence and the dewey results.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used other products from AINHOA in the past, and have found some to be good if seriously overpriced.  With the Luxe Gold Facial, however, not only is the cost far too high for a facial \\&quot;serum,\\&quot; it&#x27;s also not a particularly good product.  There are far less expensive and effective alternatives, ones that don&#x27;t include useless ingredients like caviar and gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some high hopes for this one and wanted it to blow me away, but I&#x27;m instead disappointed.  I didn&#x27;t find it any more skin-tightening or moisturizing than others we&#x27;ve used, and at $80 per ounce it&#x27;s simply not worth the cost.  Not recommended.</li>
    <li> This serum seriously tightens my face, and I love it.  After using the serum for two weeks I decided to also but the day/night lotion.  The combination of the products makes my face like young and sexy and dewy.  I was super happy today when I was mistakenly wished a happy 25th birthday instead of my 25 year old co-worker.  I&#x27;m celebrating the 7th anniversary of my 27th birthday this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum has a fairly unpleasant smell.  It isn&#x27;t awful, but you&#x27;re glad it wears off quickly.  You really can feel it tightening your skin, and I have very sensitive skin so I decided that following that tightening needed to be followed up by a very good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I guess I am a sucker for a pretty name and a pretty package but I held high hopes for this.  I am not a beauty guru by any means, just a plain Jane wanting to find a good product for the average girl.  I am hoping to regain some of that lovely dewiness to my skin that I had in my 20s and is fading now that I am in my 30s.  I find serums to be a great option.  I really didn&#x27;t look into any claims in regards to the gold, caviar, or anything and really, I don&#x27;t care.  I am not seeking a miracle or a fountain of youth but a good serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this serum felt nice on my skin and definitely gave it a nice finish but it really wasn&#x27;t any more impressive than what I pick up from MAC, Oil of Olay&#x27;s Regenerist or the other brands I have tried at Sephora.  However, this wasn&#x27;t a bad serum at all.  I really liked how my skin looked and felt after a few weeks of use!</li>
    <li> After two months, I honestly couldn&#x27;t spot a single difference or improvement in my skin since adding this to my routine.  I was using a serum from Philosophy ([[ASIN:B0018148GM Philosophy When Hope is not Enough Serum-1 oz]]) which costs a third of this and worked much better.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day for 7 days and was really hoping for something better than Department Store products, but this wasn&#x27;t much different; just more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AINHOA Caviar Gold Facial Serum with caviar extract promises to diminish fine lines on the face, on aged skin, but I can&#x27;t see any difference, and I use a magnifying glass to inspect my skin. My pores are the same size, and unfortunately, so are the wrinkles on my forehead, around my eyes, and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daily routine includes exfoliating my skin and applying a moisturizer twice a day.  I am 49 years old and have  good skin for a person of my age, thanks to a non-smoking and non-tanning or sunbathing lifestyle.  Still, I am bothered by wrinkles, especially the ones on my forehead that have recently become more pronounced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Department Store products, like Elizabeth Arden, and Kiels, but was hoping the AINHOA products might be more cost effective and have better results.  While this product does help keep my skin soft, so do Department Store products.  My wrinkles are exactly the same after 7 days of using this product 14 times.  This serum comes in a nice bottle that holds just one ounce of product, and for the price, it&#x27;s just prohibitive.  Department Store moisturizers &amp; serums offer larger quantities for comparable performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, unfortunately, this product does not impress me.  I see no real difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to say with any certainty if this product is working for me, but let me explain why. I&#x27;ve been experiencing a dryness on my face that no moisturizer has been able to correct so far. Not my Meaningful Beauty, or Clinique, or Noxema, or Cetaphil, or Vaseline. Therefore, I&#x27;m not going to speak negatively of this product as a result. However, I will say that it seems to be working on my neck. There&#x27;s a smoothness there after using it. And the serum itself has a nice texture, &amp; the scent is normal. All that being said though, I can&#x27;t see spending this kind of money for a product that only \\&quot;compliments\\&quot; your night &amp; day moisturizers. Any beauty product that costs over $50 should offer benefits that stand alone.</li>
    <li> I was planning on using this for a month before reviewing it, but sadly after two days I have to stop applying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mature skin, but it still reacts like hormonal teen skin to irritants. I have rosacea and very, very sensitive and reactive skin. I use topical treatments for my skin issues and can manage to keep it under control most of the time. If something is going to irritate anyone&#x27;s skin, it will probably be mine. The product description goes on and on about how great it is for sensitive skin, so I selected it in the hope that I would find some new, great skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had such high hopes for this serum; it smells nice, it goes on smoothly and was hydrating. I don&#x27;t buy the &#x27;gold&#x27; hype but if a product is nice, I&#x27;m going to say so. It is even packaged in a bottle that is nearly identical to Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked foundation, how neat is that? Not as &#x27;neat&#x27; as the Mt. Vesuvius that popped up on my face after my first night of using this, or its cousin nearby that came for a visit today. There was no sign of impending doom, this serum felt very comforting and soothing when I applied it. Somehow, it just flared up some zits. The kind that squirt all over your mirror. Just....darn. I really, really liked this product until it broke me out.</li>
    <li> I was anxious to try this product, because gold and caviar extracts sounds wonderful. The facial serum is the color of light peaches with real gold flecks, very pretty. It goes on smoothly and feels just a little tacky, but it dries quickly. I feel some tightening on my face and neck and I&#x27;m hoping in a month&#x27;s time this will help removes some of my small wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the slim shaped bottle and I&#x27;m a bit impressed that this is used in many European spas. I&#x27;m not sure if the gold and caviar extracts help my skin very much, but I do like the way it feels.</li>
    <li> Immediate, stellar results with this product.  Tehre really is something to this \\&quot;new\\&quot; technology. I saw a difference after just one application.  Highly recommended.</li>
</ol>
