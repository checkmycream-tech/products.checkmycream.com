      <li>Love this Stuff.</li>
      <li>I got that famous judging tattoo across my chest.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;First try it on your skin to make sure there&#x27;s no allergic reaction,</li>
      <li>They work pretty good but fade after about an hour.</li>
      <li>I was reaching a point where I couldn&#x27;t sit for more than an hour, hour and a half at best.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t expect this spray to make the full process of getting a tattoo to be pain free, but overall it is great and will help!</li>
      <li>Lidocaine in general is a great numbing agent.</li>
      <li>No tattoo is pain free, but this product site helps.</li>
      <li>It aint cheap.</li>
      <li>so then he sprayed about 3-5 sprays on it and the rest of the 2hours went completely smooth</li>
      <li>My tattoo artist used this about 2days ago on me on a tattoo on the back of my arm, let me tell you it works great.</li>
      <li>Worth the $$$!  </li>
      <li>Left that Saran wrap in for maybe 5 min and was ready to go,  It worked so good!</li>
      <li>I have not been able to use this product yet because I have been spending my money here instead of on some much needed ink, however she has used it for a foot tattoo and was amazed at how well it worked.</li>
      <li>last two sessions were painless, surprisingly painless.</li>
      <li>those who&#x27;ve never used it a quick application</li>
      <li>it will soak in quick and start helping.</li>
      <li>It does wear off quick</li>
      <li>It does wear off quick</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s greater then 3 hours, however long you sit is easy as pie!</li>
      <li>and I wish I had it when I did my first ribcage!  </li>
      <li>worth the try</li>
      <li>I purchased a 5% lidocaine perfect to outline the tattoo and then used this one the skin was broken.</li>
      <li>It looks like a freshly done 5 min ago tatoo.</li>
      <li>It looks like a freshly done 5 min ago tatoo.</li>
      <li>Please do not use this stuff, pain is worth it.</li>
      <li>It is worth the investment to try plus dr. numb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It makes the long sessions so much more bearable!</li>
      <li>it where&#x27;s off in about 10 minutes in some areas,when the tattoo heals the ink peels right off,not to mention the burning and stinging of the product when the effect is wearing off.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, I spent a good chunk of change on a product that did absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>I nearly had a nap if it wasn&#x27;t for the sound of the machine.</li>
      <li>I had about an hr more left</li>
      <li>My dog uses Lidocaine for her hot spots and combined w/cortisone</li>
      <li>so my tattoo artist sprayed some on and after a short time I was able to relax.</li>
      <li>it actually holds the blood off during tattoo process and makes skin easier to work with in longer sessions and all my customers love it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not my first rodeo when it comes to getting tattooed in places that hurt.  </li>
      <li>The tattoo guy, who&#x27;s a friend of mine, had just bought one bottle of that vasocaine and encouraged me to get a new tattoo on my belly (considered one of the most sensitive spots).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Wow!!!!</li>
      <li>This tattoo spray works very very well...... for large tattoos.</li>
      <li>I have a full chest tattoo (bra as my tattoist calls it)  and had started getting work on a full back piece done.</li>
      <li>Works really well, but I won&#x27;t recommend more than 1 application on the Same area</li>
      <li>I would absolutely reccomend this product to anyone getting a large tattoo.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t feel the tattoo at all.</li>
      <li>works really well...</li>
      <li>That stuff works real well.</li>
      <li>Vasocaine has helped so much.</li>
      <li>So he remembered he had some of this Vasocaine and he sprayed this very sore area and in about 5 mins the pain went from a 10 to a tolerable 5.  </li>
      <li>Makes the tattoo go So much faster</li>
      <li>After about 5 mintues the numbing is noticeable and very tolerable.</li>
      <li>All I can say is, WOW!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;m working on some large cover up pieces on my back and side. After seven sessions I&#x27;ve learned that I cannot tolerate getting tattooed, the pain has become unbearable. I was reaching a point where I couldn&#x27;t sit for more than an hour, hour and a half at best. Started using Dr. Numb, which is great but only lasts through the first pass... once the artist goes back to the same area for color or a touch up the pain is much worse. Now we are using Dr. Numb and Vasocain. I can&#x27;t believe what a difference this made. I sat for almost 3 hrs on my ribs. Could&#x27;ve kept going but my guy had another appointment so we had to stop. I know numbing isn&#x27;t the tough thing to do to get thru tattoos but I&#x27;m trying to fix what I did when I was younger. I&#x27;m not in it for the experience this go round. Use this coupled with Dr. Numb and you&#x27;ll sit like a champ!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not my first rodeo when it comes to getting tattooed in places that hurt.  The pain is one thing, but then your skin will react and it will cut your session down by 75%.  Vascocaine is great, your artist will have to start tattoing you, say for the first hour, then on your break, spray the vasocaine, wrap the area for about 15 minutes and then you are good to go, I&#x27;m talking ZERO pain!</li>
    <li> Works great but only when the skin is broken. Love this stuff😍</li>
    <li> I have about 60-70 hours worth of tattoos so far, and I&#x27;m working on the second the half of my back tattoo right now.  This spray definitely works.  It will not work for outlines, but for the shading you have to have broken skin and then the spray works 100%.  As the artist moves outside of the affected area the full pain comes back, but just use another spray.  Typically for each hour, 2 or 3 applications of the spray keeps the pain down.  After a 2 hour back session I&#x27;m miserable from the pain, but last night I was in a great mood and felt wonderful.  One thing that I&#x27;ve noticed is that once I&#x27;m home and all the numbing has subsided the pain comes back really strong, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.  This does not affect the healing process.  Don&#x27;t expect this spray to make the full process of getting a tattoo to be pain free, but overall it is great and will help!</li>
    <li> It works .... Amazing ..... Had tattoo done. Outline does not work with the spray but the shading ..... Unbelievable.... You don&#x27;t feel a thing....worth the try</li>
    <li> Works for some, not for me.</li>
    <li> Lidocaine in general is a great numbing agent. I get it injected into my spine because I broke my back 4 years ago, well, it&#x27;s Bivippicaine but it&#x27;s the same family. My dog uses Lidocaine for her hot spots and combined w/cortisone it brings her allergy and pain relief.  Lidocaine has been snuck into a lot of our everyday products that we either take for granted or don&#x27;t have a clue about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 44 year old female and have been getting tattoos since I was 17 and I have over 125 hours and most of my body except my legs covered. I have my stomach, my rib cage, my neck, my collarbone.  And I have it with detailed portraits and when I got out of jail I got that famous judging tattoo across my chest.  I don&#x27;t have stars, sparrows, traditional or any of that stuff on my body. I have all black and grey portraits or animal realism.  The point of this is that my tattoos are time consuming and VERY detailed. It&#x27;s not just some swirly wallpaper. Most of my large pieces were 13 hour sits and a 4 hour return the following day on the same area. It can be done, you just don&#x27;t wash anything off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So pain is something I am used to and part of the entire tattoo process. You EARN your stripes. That&#x27;s the generation I&#x27;m from at least. I recently fitted Hazel the rabbit from the Watership Down book/cartoon into a tight nasty area below my neck and this is a small 2 hour tattoo but my guy was not happy with the angle he was hitting it at and my skin was involuntarily jumping, crawling. So he remembered he had some of this Vasocaine and he sprayed this very sore area and in about 5 mins the pain went from a 10 to a tolerable 5.  You WILL NOT go into a tattoo shop, fall asleep and wake up with a scaled, intricate Koi fish across your back. You will still feel the pain but it takes the BITE out of the tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another guy there was joking about how only wusses use this stuff and I can tell you that after 20plus years of getting tattoo&#x27;d, I&#x27;ve earned the relief this stuff brought. I bought this for my tattoo guy as a gift since I used what he had but if you have gotten tattoos before and are getting a real painful one, try this, it works but do not try it on your first tattoo. I&#x27;m sorry, man up !!! You need to suffer a while before you use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also helpful for veterans to know that this brings the swelling down. The pic I attached is about 18 hours after I had it done and normally when the swelling and redness starts and look at it. It looks like a freshly done 5 min ago tatoo. That&#x27;s a good thing!!! Now I can go back and finally fill that entire area up tommorrow and that was the last open spot I had on my upper body.  Goodbye Skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also for Tattoo Newbies. I&#x27;ve seen tattoo shops charging $20-$25 to use Lidocaine sprays on your tattoo and buyer beware.  It only takes a few sprays of this and granted it&#x27;s a 4oz bottle I think but that&#x27;s almost the entire cost of the spray!!! Buy your own and bring it with you. Don&#x27;t let anyone waste it either. Have them spray the bleeding wound because you need to have your skin opened before it works, it will sting like a MF and then calm down and numb. It does wear off quick so they&#x27;ll spray again but all in all, it should only be 3-4 sprays. Enjoy your tattoos and tough it out first, don&#x27;t take the easy way out.ught this for my tattoo guy as a gift since I used what he had but if you have gotten tattoos before and are getting a real painful one, try this, it works but do not try it on your first tattoo.

    <li> Ok I am heavily tattooed and have gotten to the point due to lupus I no longer tolerate the pain well.  This stuff is great. Now mind you the skin has to he broken for it to work. I had my guy do all outline work and a little bit of shading about an hours work and we took a break. This is a large tattoo about the size of a paper plate and heavily shaded. During our break about 10 mins I sprayed the tattoo several times letting it soak in. I was in a considerable amount of pain and considering stopping for the day. So glad I found this stuff! I didn&#x27;t feel a thing at all, the area was completely numb! The next hour was a cake walk even my tattoo artist was impressed.</li>
    <li> I was getting a piece to cover my arm from elbow to wrist (roughly a 9 hour session) and after a few hours it was getting tender so my tattoo artist sprayed some on and after a short time I was able to relax. It WILL NOT work unless there&#x27;s enough broken skin. I recommend this for people who are sitting for longer sessions</li>
    <li> IT works. It numbs the skin to the effect that sutures or surgical staples can be applied. If sprayed on a cottion ball or swab, it can be inserted into a wound to numb the inside before debriding and clean-up</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had been tattooed dozens of times. I always promised myself that would be the last one, because of the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last two sessions were painless, surprisingly painless. The tattoo guy, who&#x27;s a friend of mine, had just bought one bottle of that vasocaine and encouraged me to get a new tattoo on my belly (considered one of the most sensitive spots).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i gotta say I didn&#x27;t feel a thing. That feeling is especially weird because you feel something is going on (the bleeding, the tearing and stuff), but you don&#x27;t feel the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last experience was in the bottom of my back. Never felt anything again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i just don&#x27;t give it 5 stars because of its price. Could be way cheaper.</li>
    <li> Wish I would&#x27;ve had this years ago. I told my artist &amp;#34;r u tatting me&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t feel it.&amp;#34; Skin has to b broken for it to work good. Straight up numb.</li>
    <li> Works really well, but I won&#x27;t recommend more than 1 application on the Same area</li>
    <li> I have over 100 hours of tattoo work. Vasocaine has helped so much. I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to continue without it. It has saved me.</li>
    <li> Best tattoo Spray out there and I&#x27;ve used 2 other kinds. After the out line of my 5 hr tattoo was done.  I used this stuff every half hr To Hr. And would spray it on myself then saran wrap the tattoo after I was done spraying it. Left that Saran wrap in for maybe 5 min and was ready to go,  It worked so good! I will always use this stuff!  I really didn&#x27;t feel the tattoo at all. I&#x27;m ordering more today because I have another tattoo I&#x27;m getting Sept 11. Also Before I went to the Tattoo shop I used Dr Numb cream and applied it where I was getting the tattoo. left that on for a hr. I also put the saran wrap over the Dr Numb cream and let that on for a Hr. My skin was so Numb when we started tattooing I didn&#x27;t even know he was tattooing me. It was great! Love this Stuff. I just ordered 5 More tubes Of Dr Numb and more of this spray for me and my Gf. I Would never get another tattoo this out using this stuff. Love It! Oh and my Tattoo Came out great!!!! Makes the tattoo go So much faster bc your not in pain and the guy tattooing you can just go to town on you and knock it out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 10 hours into a badly scarred coverup which is over an old surgical scar and this spray has been a lifesaver! I had never used a numbing spray prior to this tattoo and definitely wasn&#x27;t expecting it, but after my artist saw my discomfort after some outlining, he spritzed me over, let it sit while we took a stretch break and came back... after having spent the beginning of my session flinching, I felt NOTHING. Not a single drop of pain through the next 2 hours, even over the thickest parts of scarring. I started referring to Vasocaine as magic in a bottle and it truly is!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: The skin HAS TO BE broken prior to application; this product does not absorb through your skin, rather it absorbs through the existing wound. If you&#x27;re uncomfortable in places after initial application, there wasn&#x27;t enough broken skin in the area for it to get there; your artist can always apply more through the work to keep you comfortable!</li>
    <li> O i have been working on a full sleeve that wraps onto my chest, over my shoulder and on my back, there are some very sensative areas in there. If you are getting an outline or some small shading this wont work for you at all whatsoever. now with that said since my tattoo is all color it helps to have it, once the skin is opened up (meaning youve already suffered though at least some pain and are possibly 1/3 done with your whole tattoo) it works awesome, on my chest i wanted something to at least dull the pain but once this stuff soaked into my skin i couldnt feel anything but the vibration of the tattoo gun. I know that everyone is different and that some people will say it works some say it doesnt, but i wanted to clarify that its not going to just absorb into your skin. Your skin is just doing what its supposed to do by keeping things out of your bloodstream, but when youve got and open wound if you will (a tattoo) it will soak in quick and start helping.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after my 4th 3 hour tattoo session on my back. Wow! What a difference it made! What used to be excruciating pain is now tolerable. I would absolutely reccomend this product to anyone getting a large tattoo. It makes the long sessions so much more bearable!</li>
    <li> I heard that this stuff was or should work and it all depends on your skin.  My buddy and I did a two day session of tattooing (I got 6 hours of work done on my ribs and my buddy did 4 hours on his chest and leg).  It totally worked on me and I almost fell asleep because I couldn&#x27;t feel anything.  It didn&#x27;t work that well with my buddy though.  I would say mileage will vary and for me it was a DREAM and I wish I had it when I did my first ribcage!  It is worth the investment to try plus dr. numb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used some dr. numb instead of vasoline while he tattooed so that could have helped even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I did feel it a little bit till it kicked in, so it isn&#x27;t instant.  I would recommend getting some dr. numb, wrapping the area up for 120min then start the tattoo process and then use the spray to keep it numb.  It worked perfectly for me!</li>
    <li> This stuff sucked! It didn&#x27;t work at all, it was truly a waste money and a big painful disappointment. I wonder if I could get my money back.</li>
    <li> This tattoo spray works very very well...... for large tattoos. If anyone buying this thinks that they will spray it and then have no more pain, you will be sorely mistaken. This works by osmosis, and to work properly, your skin has to be broken. Outline - spray, Grey work - spray, shading- spray. No tattoo is pain free, but this product site helps.</li>
    <li> game changer. a total game changer. love it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF, ONCE YOU GET THE OUT LINE, THE REST IS A BREEZE. I FELT NOTHING. WE HAVE BOUGHT A TOTAL OF 3 BOTTLES EVERYONE THAT HAS TRIED IT LOVES IT. WILL BE A STAPLE IN TATTOO SHOP FROM NOW ON. NO OTHER NUMBING CREAMS OR SPRAYS HAVE WORKED LIKE THIS</li>
    <li> Recommended by a friend who used it sucsessfully but it burned my skin upon application.  Would not order it again.</li>
    <li> Price is high but works make sure u apply thin or u might get the same tattoo again</li>
    <li> This product was a joint purchase between myself and a friend. I have not been able to use this product yet because I have been spending my money here instead of on some much needed ink, however she has used it for a foot tattoo and was amazed at how well it worked. She said that once the outline is done, and the skin is broken, when you spray it on, it relieves pain instantly and she felt no pain for the duration of her tattoo. She said she could feel the tattoo happening, but could feel no pain. I can&#x27;t wait to try it out!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help with the pain of a scar cover up. I did not have it for my first sitting but by the time I went for my second session I had it m. There was no relief.</li>
    <li> I successfully got my ribs done!</li>
    <li> This product worked great for me. I used a micro needle roller on my arm before applying spray left it on with plastic wrap for about 20 minutes and repeated the same process and left the wrap on til 10 minutes before my appointment and sat for 3 hours basically pain free. The skin must be broken for this spray to work. It will not work if the skin isnt broken. Tattoo healed great. No different than if I wouldn&#x27;t have used anything. I have a lot of tattoo work and would recommend this to someone looking to sit comfortable during a long session as long as you use it correctly.</li>
    <li> Works okay, kinda. Used a few times with varying results.</li>
    <li> I have to say that they show that you get 3 bottles. But in reality you get one bottle for that price.. There is another one same product shows only 1 bottle for cheaper. Get that one instead. save money i hollered false adverticment. Your pics are to show what YOU ARE getting.&lt;br /&gt; But i do have to say the product is great. My brother tested it out on himself. and he messed himself up. He couldn&#x27;t tell how deep the needle was due to his leg being numb. so word of advice just be very careful when useing this product. works really well...&lt;br /&gt; I give product A 5 stars but the service from the company i give a 0 stars. Amazon is not that company by the way Amazon is the middle man who listened to me...</li>
    <li> I can not believe how well this works, unbelievable ! Only works on area of skin that has been broken already by needle but once you deal with initial pain, the following shading with be completely numb</li>
    <li> Please do not use this stuff, pain is worth it. Not only personally on my tattoo but on 3 of my friends when this was used our skin rejected the ink and scabbed over horribly and ruined the ink. My tattoo artist was great and of course fixed it, but it&#x27;s not worth having to do it all over again simply for this stuff.</li>
    <li> I use this for permanent makeup procedures and it is my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; numbing liquid for just about everything....even effective on hard to numb clients.  I also use i for my own tattoos and has been AMAZING for my full backpiece! I actually fall asleep!</li>
    <li> I REALLY wanted a product to make a bikini wax less painful- even if it was just a teensy-weensy bit less painful!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I spent a good chunk of change on a product that did absolutely nothing. Truly, it did not affect my pain level one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My waxer told me that she&#x27;s tried these sprays before too, also with no avail. Maybe it&#x27;s a mental relief that they give? Maybe it only works on some people? I don&#x27;t know, but I can attest that it did not work for me!</li>
    <li> Wow!!!! Worth the $$$!  8 hour sessions are nothing with this!  You can only use it when the skin breaks. This is for any pain relief spray or cream, THE SKIN MUST BE BROKEN.  If you are getting tattooed for less then 3 hours, then don&#x27;t waste your time and deal with the pain.  If it&#x27;s greater then 3 hours, however long you sit is easy as pie!</li>
    <li> I have been getting tattooed for years now, I have endured some of the worst places to get ink, ribs, knee cap, foot, elbow. just recently my artist tried some of this spray on me to test it out. WOW, once the skin is broken this will numb you right up. amazing product!!!!</li>
    <li> Just got my inner arm tattooed tonight, right near my armpit, which is known to be one of the more painful spits.. Anyways, did the whole outline without any product then sprayed a bit on the site a few times during the shading and anyone who has tattoos knows going back over raw spots that have started to swell is not pleasant. This stuff works wonders!! For the most part I didn&#x27;t feel anything, maybe a few patches here or there. I&#x27;m amazed at how well this spray does what is advertises, definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> best buy ever bought a ton of this from this seller if people say it doesn&#x27;t work they don&#x27;t know how to use and and need to stop being a kitchen magician</li>
    <li> Best thing out there! Use it sparingly!</li>
    <li> This is not to be used before your tattoo. Skin must be broken before the spray is used. Apply to the area after skin has been broken, cover with wrap and let sit for 10-20 minutes. BAM! Painless tattoo. I suggest using a 5+% lido cream 2 hours before covered in wrap and then this during and you will not feel a thing.</li>
    <li> I was into my 6th hr of tattooing when we decided to use the spray. I had about an hr more left and I was getting twitchy. Yes it numbed, but it was only the area that had already been drilled, not the area that was to be drilled. It also stung super bad when sprayed on! Now 5 days later, I have to have a good portion of the tattoo touched up, due to color leaching, and I have started a regime of benadryl because it turns out I am allergic.&lt;br /&gt;I know not everyone will have such an adverse reaction but be aware that it is possible.</li>
    <li> Holy crap this stuff is amazing. I have a 3/4 body suit with probably around 250 hours getting tattoo&#x27;ed so i know what the needle is suppose to feel like. Last few sessions i am tired of dealing with the pain(earned my tattoos by now), so i tried the lidocain based gel. They work pretty good but fade after about an hour. Like people have stated, this only works once the skin is open. If you have them do the line work and spray this on, it will help spread a little into the shading area,so when that new skin breaks its more tolerable. Then my artist was liberal spraying every couple of minutes, spraying on the shading area before so he could work it into the skin. After about 5 mintues the numbing is noticeable and very tolerable. After about 15 minutes of liberal spraying, i was 100% numb. Not an exaggeration, I literally nodded off for a second day dreaming (and instantly jerked awake) while he was shading on my ribs! and this was 2.5 hours in when i would normally be pretty raw.  He said it dries a little sticky but didn&#x27;t bother him, and he sprayed me very often and only like a 5% of the bottle was gone after 4 hours. Again, you will have 5-10 minutes of suck while the skin is being broken open then smooth sailing.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great...</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. But only after skin is broken. Once skin is broken, all I felt was slight pressure. Healing has been much worse than usual not sure why.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work like its promised, it takes a long time to work and it where&#x27;s off in about 10 minutes in some areas,when the tattoo heals the ink peels right off,not to mention the burning and stinging of the product when the effect is wearing off.I would buy it again as a matter of fact I&#x27;m trying to return it</li>
    <li> Worked well felt no pain while getting a tattoo. I recommend this product for people who can not tolerate the pain</li>
    <li> I was not real fond of this product. It didn&#x27;t seem to work at all unfortunatly. I am going back to the Dr Numb cream. That stuff works real well. Won&#x27;t purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Need to break the skin for it to work, but isn&#x27;t that the time you want it to work?  Waste of money, sorry.</li>
    <li> Came across this stuff on a Facebook post a bit back. I have a full chest tattoo (bra as my tattoist calls it)  and had started getting work on a full back piece done. The back was excruciating and I could only handle an hour to an hour and a half at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I carefully read up the application guide and we tried Vasocaine spray today. WOW......... It was mad, I took 3 hours of tattoing without a single clench or flinch. YOU NEED BROKEN SKIN FOR THIS TO GET IN, so it&#x27;s no good for outlines. Shading is mad as areas that would normally be getting incredibly sensitive because of the amount of broken skin can really soak the stuff in and go completely numb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally found 3 sprays every 20 minutes really kept pain down to nearly nothing. New areas obviously hurt until the skin is broken enough for it to get in but once it&#x27;s there you&#x27;ve got plain sailing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who&#x27;ve never used it a quick application guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First try it on your skin to make sure there&#x27;s no allergic reaction, after that a small amount of light shading works well to break the skin. Give 3 sprays of Vasocaine a couple of inches away from the area to be worked, leave for 90 seconds then wipe off excess. To start off with it will still hurt but once what&#x27;s soaked into the skin gets worked under with the needle the pain just vanishes. My tattooist was impressed on how unlike creams it didn&#x27;t leave the skin puffy or slimey and in no way affected how she was putting the ink in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full on 5 star rating for a top product, be prepared to pay for the stuff. It aint cheap.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever, I Was a little hesitant at first but now, I will use it and refer it to anyone getting a big or detailed tattoo!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great numbing solution, works great! Will continue use of this product. I have used other topical ointment and so far they don&#x27;t stand up to the effectiveness of this product. Vasocaine outlast others that I have tried! Works great!</li>
    <li> While there are some great reviews of this product BEWARE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a tattoo artist as well as a tattoo collector and this spray (even when used sparingly) has caused infections in my latest two tattoos. I know how to care for my tattoos and have done nothing differently than I have in the past. Vasocaine was the only difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, during the tattoo process this spray helps significantly reduce the pain you will feel but I will never use this again.</li>
    <li> I used this on my sternum. Works great to numb. That&#x27;s it. When the numb goes away you get the full pain times ten. The ink bleeds, and it scabs worse than normal. Do yourself a favor don&#x27;t use this product. Unless you want to get the tattoo twice.</li>
    <li> My tattoo artist used this about 2days ago on me on a tattoo on the back of my arm, let me tell you it works great. I couldnt stand the pain so then he sprayed about 3-5 sprays on it and the rest of the 2hours went completely smooth, my tattoo is healing perfectly normal. Skin doesnt really have to be broken, just make sure you shave the area before applying it because your pores just have to be open a little bit so the your skin can soak up the liquid. I tried using Tattoo Soothe topical anesthetic which works fine also but takes about an hour to numb the skin, Vasocaine takes about only 20min or less to numb. My artist charged an extra 20 bucks to use but i might as well just buy a bottle myself.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work that well</li>
    <li> Amazing didn&#x27;t feel a thing... I purchased a 5% lidocaine perfect to outline the tattoo and then used this one the skin was broken. Best thing ever</li>
    <li> Obviously it only works once the outline is down, but the more open skin you&#x27;ve got, the better it works. I literally fell asleep in the chair because I couldn&#x27;t feel any pain whatsoever. If you&#x27;ve never gotten a tattoo while using this stuff, you&#x27;re insane!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel a thing!!!! Your tattoo artist must tattoo u first to open your pores. But after you are half way through you can use the spray and feel nothing!!! Literally nothing!!!</li>
    <li> Vasocaine numbing spray did not work at all for me. I know everyone is different so please try it for yourswlf because I have heard that it does work. Not at all in my case. Good Luck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of bad reviews on here but these people aren&#x27;t using it properly. IT ONLY WORKS ON OPEN WOUNDS. I was having the inside of my bicep tattooed and was getting bad muscle twitch so gave it a squirt with vasocaine. It was applied after the outline and then I couldn&#x27;t feel a thing after about 5 mins.  I nearly had a nap if it wasn&#x27;t for the sound of the machine. Bit expense but when it comes to tattooing the more painful areas, definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> Used for multiple bug bits.  It does work better on open or recent sores.  Allowed me to sleep through the night and put covers over my bites so they could heal better.  Only wish I would have discovered this earlier.</li>
    <li> I did not personally buy this, my artist did. All I can say is, WOW!!! After the affected area has been saturated,  you feel Nothing.  I mean, nothing!</li>
    <li> I am a studio owner and this by far of all Ive tested this product is the best...Works best if allowed to sit and penetrate after applying for about 3 to 5 minutes AFTER OUTLINE....then when needed during tattoo procedure...... as a artist i love it... it actually holds the blood off during tattoo process and makes skin easier to work with in longer sessions and all my customers love it as well picture i posted was done with Vasocaine this was a 5 hour total session and my results were perfect</li>
