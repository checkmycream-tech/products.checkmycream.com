### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to keep searching for the perfect &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; after-shower lotion.</li>
      <li>Avalon Organics, however, is an excellent replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product, however, is excellent.</li>
      <li>I have never found a hand and/or body lotion as good as this one!  </li>
      <li>I have used it well over a year, probably even over two years, and it is great.</li>
      <li>I’ve experienced no reactions to the lotion and it is indeed fragrance</li>
      <li>happy with this product.</li>
      <li>So happy with the results.  </li>
      <li>Not sticky, and very effective.</li>
      <li>It is the perfect texture, reasonably priced, long-lasting, and - best of all! - unscented!  </li>
      <li>Perfect to use when pregnant or breast feeding.  </li>
      <li>Will buy more!</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>This lotion is nice.</li>
      <li>It rubs in nicely and seems to moisturize a while on my skin.</li>
      <li>excellent non-greasy moisturizer, quickly absorbing product...love it</li>
      <li>It soaks into the skin nicely.</li>
      <li>The moisturizer may turn out to be great but we certainly won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
      <li>in all… and excellent daily lotion that is great for the whole family.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>So glad I tried this.  </li>
      <li>I love this hand lotion</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the way this lotion makes my skin feel.  </li>
      <li>I love this hand lotion.</li>
      <li>If there is a better lotion, I don&#x27;t know what it is.</li>
      <li>And I love that there is nothing toxic in it.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>My skin dries out easily, and it has been a challenge to find a lotion that keeps the skin moist and flexible, yet is not sticky.  </li>
      <li>Some better than others but nothing special.  </li>
      <li>I’ve been using Aveeno for years and loved it, so when Amazon decided to remove it from the Subscribe and Save program I was hesitant to try something new.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to love this, but it doesn&#x27;t absorb into my skin as quickly as I would like.  </li>
      <li>Was excited to receive this lotion, but then after checking the EWG website, I found this was rated a \\&quot;moderate\\&quot; hazard of \\&quot;3\\&quot;, with ingredients including POTASSIUM SORBATE, BENZYL ALCOHOL and POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s absorbed very quickly.  </li>
      <li>It is well-priced, organic, moisturizes well, and absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>The texture is super creamy</li>
      <li>I use it both during the winter (dry air, courtesy of our forced-air heating system) and the hot, humid summer here in Houston, and it performs great during both times of year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written which tells you something!  </li>
      <li>and I noticed it right</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and leaves just a bit of residue for a minute or so, after which it completely absorbs into my skin and has no stickiness or odor.  </li>
      <li>The first night I put this on him</li>
      <li>(just not moisturizing enough) or overwhelming (greasy, oily residue).</li>
      <li>The next morning I was amazed at how much better his skin looked.  </li>
      <li>Many, many moisturizing products seem to have a hard time not being underwhelming</li>
      <li>it feels so nice and smooth when you put it it on but not greasy or wet .... smells good too and the bottle looks expensive</li>
      <li>The lotion seems nice, while it says unscented it does have a slight smell to it.</li>
      <li>My skin is super sensitive and it doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.</li>
      <li>but it really isn&#x27;t i even use it on my neck and chest.</li>
      <li>Its smell is light and natural, no overpowering added fragrances, my body soaks up the lotion and leaves my skin soft and happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just received the third bottle and it did come inside a box, but low and behold the top had come untwisted during shipment</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s tried so many things for his dry hands and he finally found something he likes.</li>
      <li>I contacted Amazon and returned the bottle for a new one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of lotions in the past, which were all ok.  </li>
      <li>The second bottle arrived packaged even worse than the first bottle, sent in nothing more than a padded envelope!</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try if you have dry skin.  </li>
      <li>I applied it again, no crying this time, and cannot believe the results.  </li>
      <li>(I got lotion that was 7 years old at one point) and Amazon&#x27;s had a 2011 date on it.</li>
      <li>(ie, we didn&#x27;t use it fast enough)</li>
      <li>His skin is baby soft after two applications.  </li>
      <li>The smell is not particularly bad or lingering, but it does have a slight scent.</li>
      <li>This was barely lotion.</li>
      <li>The green package without the label looks pretty</li>
      <li>The lotion keeps my dry sensitive skin moisturized all day.  </li>
      <li>I recently ordered this lotion for my five year old boy who has very dry skin.  </li>
      <li>I am writing this review only a couple of hours after receiving this lotion, so I cannot vouch for how good or bad this lotion may be.  </li>

<li> /&gt;Avalon Organics lotion is very thick and rich.  </li>
<li> This is nice rich lotion that has no odor or nasty chemicals.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been noticing this happen more frequently lately but a lot of online companies seem to sell lotion past the expiration date.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve actually used lotion 1 or 2 year past the sold date and didn&#x27;t notice anything different, but this particular one had a sour smell</li>
<li> and I thought maybe it had been too long a time</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve already purchased a second bottle and will be trying other products by this company.</li>
<li> I just want to warn potential buyers that the pump was defective and this may be the case with other bottles.  </li>
<li> he cried for about five minutes because his skin was that dry.  </li>
<li> My skin is so dry</li>
<li> lotion my mom had been using had the same sour smell</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m not wasting my time or money ordering it from Amazon again only to have half the bottle leak out in shipping.</li>
<li> Unfortunately I won&#x27;t be using it after this last bottle because I cannot buy it where I live overseas</li>
<li> A little goes a long way!</li>
<li> all of which play naughty tricks on our bodies, there are other lotions with an EWG rating of \\&quot;0\\&quot;, hopefully Avalon Organics will get their act together with this stuff.</li>
<li> /&gt;The one down side is the price.</li>
<li> I have purchased at least 5  bottles of this, and I personally have never had trouble with the pump like the previous reviewer.</li>
<li> It too had been damaged in shipment and half the contents had leaked out inside the package.</li>
<li> Half the lotion had leaked out into the bag that was tied around it for shipment.</li>
<li> The first bottle arrived poorly packaged in a cardboard wrap and the bottle neck had been broken in transit.</li>
<li> No matter how hard my husband and I tried, the damn thing wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
<li> I have used it for at least 5 years.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a mess and useless.</li>
<li> Couldn&#x27;t even use it - didn&#x27;t moisturize because it was so thin.</li>
<li> Very disappointing.</li>
<li> I was very Disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am writing this review only a couple of hours after receiving this lotion, so I cannot vouch for how good or bad this lotion may be.  I just want to warn potential buyers that the pump was defective and this may be the case with other bottles.  No matter how hard my husband and I tried, the damn thing wouldn&#x27;t work.  We finally covered the bottle with aluminum foil and plan to \\&quot;pour\\&quot; out the lotion until we finish it.  The moisturizer may turn out to be great but we certainly won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> excellent non-greasy moisturizer, quickly absorbing product...love it</li>
    <li> This is nice rich lotion that has no odor or nasty chemicals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been noticing this happen more frequently lately but a lot of online companies seem to sell lotion past the expiration date. Bath &amp; Body works does this (I got lotion that was 7 years old at one point) and Amazon&#x27;s had a 2011 date on it. I&#x27;ve actually used lotion 1 or 2 year past the sold date and didn&#x27;t notice anything different, but this particular one had a sour smell and I noticed it right away.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion my mom had been using had the same sour smell and I thought maybe it had been too long a time (ie, we didn&#x27;t use it fast enough) but when I got this bottle in, I checked the dates and realized both bottles had a 2011 date on it. I will not be buying Avalon Organics online anymore. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> My skin dries out easily, and it has been a challenge to find a lotion that keeps the skin moist and flexible, yet is not sticky.  In addition, I have been seeking a lotion that does not have potentially harmful ingredients.  Unfortunately, that requirement rules out most of the lotions sold in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it was a delight to discover the Avalon Organics lotions.  Not sticky, and very effective. Well selected ingredients.  Guests who have tried this lotion have become instant converts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one down side is the price. And that&#x27;s why I buy from Amazon, often getting the 32 oz. size.</li>
    <li> Many, many moisturizing products seem to have a hard time not being underwhelming (just not moisturizing enough) or overwhelming (greasy, oily residue). This product, however, is excellent. Its smell is light and natural, no overpowering added fragrances, my body soaks up the lotion and leaves my skin soft and happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this product. Will buy more!</li>
    <li> This lotion WORKS!  My skin is so dry and I&#x27;ve never had lotion work this well before.  So happy with the results.  Definitely worth a try if you have dry skin.  And I love that there is nothing toxic in it.</li>
    <li> I got it today. The lotion is leaking all over the place and the pump doesn&#x27;t work at all. It&#x27;s a mess and useless.</li>
    <li> This was barely lotion. Couldn&#x27;t even use it - didn&#x27;t moisturize because it was so thin. I was very Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have used it well over a year, probably even over two years, and it is great. My skin is super sensitive and it doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.</li>
    <li> I love this hand lotion it feels so nice and smooth when you put it it on but not greasy or wet .... smells good too and the bottle looks expensive but it really isn&#x27;t i even use it on my neck and chest.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Perfect to use when pregnant or breast feeding.  A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I have never found a hand and/or body lotion as good as this one!  It is the perfect texture, reasonably priced, long-lasting, and - best of all! - unscented!  I love it. I have purchased at least 5  bottles of this, and I personally have never had trouble with the pump like the previous reviewer.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this, but it doesn&#x27;t absorb into my skin as quickly as I would like.  I&#x27;m going to keep searching for the perfect &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; after-shower lotion.</li>
    <li> Was excited to receive this lotion, but then after checking the EWG website, I found this was rated a \\&quot;moderate\\&quot; hazard of \\&quot;3\\&quot;, with ingredients including POTASSIUM SORBATE, BENZYL ALCOHOL and POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE all of which play naughty tricks on our bodies, there are other lotions with an EWG rating of \\&quot;0\\&quot;, hopefully Avalon Organics will get their act together with this stuff.</li>
    <li> Had to wait until I convinced my husband to try this.  He finally did and he loves it!!!  He&#x27;s tried so many things for his dry hands and he finally found something he likes.</li>
    <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written which tells you something!  I recently ordered this lotion for my five year old boy who has very dry skin.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of lotions in the past, which were all ok.  Some better than others but nothing special.  The first night I put this on him he cried for about five minutes because his skin was that dry.  The next morning I was amazed at how much better his skin looked.  I applied it again, no crying this time, and cannot believe the results.  His skin is baby soft after two applications.  I was not at all expecting this!  So glad I tried this.  Hope it is just as helpful to others.</li>
    <li> This lotion is nice. Creamy.</li>
    <li> Amazon has sent me three bottles of this stuff now and I have given up trying to order it from them. The first bottle arrived poorly packaged in a cardboard wrap and the bottle neck had been broken in transit. Half the lotion had leaked out into the bag that was tied around it for shipment. I contacted Amazon and returned the bottle for a new one. The second bottle arrived packaged even worse than the first bottle, sent in nothing more than a padded envelope! It too had been damaged in shipment and half the contents had leaked out inside the package. This time I called Amazon, and they told me to send it back to them and they would replace it again. I just received the third bottle and it did come inside a box, but low and behold the top had come untwisted during shipment and it had leaked out of the bottle some again. At this point I give up. The lotion seems nice, while it says unscented it does have a slight smell to it. The smell is not particularly bad or lingering, but it does have a slight scent. It rubs in nicely and seems to moisturize a while on my skin. Unfortunately I won&#x27;t be using it after this last bottle because I cannot buy it where I live overseas and I&#x27;m not wasting my time or money ordering it from Amazon again only to have half the bottle leak out in shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a lotion addict, and every so often I buy a different brand of lotion.  It never lives up to this one.  This lotion checks every box for me.  It is well-priced, organic, moisturizes well, and absorbs quickly.  If there is a better lotion, I don&#x27;t know what it is.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the way this lotion makes my skin feel.  The texture is super creamy and it&#x27;s absorbed very quickly.  I use it both during the winter (dry air, courtesy of our forced-air heating system) and the hot, humid summer here in Houston, and it performs great during both times of year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remove the label for a cleaner look, that way I can leave a bottle out on my bedside table and it doesn&#x27;t look too cluttered.  The green package without the label looks pretty sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this lotion!</li>
    <li> Avalon Organics aloe unscented body lotion is just what I was looking for to replace the Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion I was using.  I’ve been using Aveeno for years and loved it, so when Amazon decided to remove it from the Subscribe and Save program I was hesitant to try something new.  Avalon Organics, however, is an excellent replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avalon Organics lotion is very thick and rich.  It goes on smoothly and leaves just a bit of residue for a minute or so, after which it completely absorbs into my skin and has no stickiness or odor.  The lotion keeps my dry sensitive skin moisturized all day.  I’ve experienced no reactions to the lotion and it is indeed fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added benefit of the Avalon Organics lotion is that it contains 70% organic ingredients and the bottle is made from 100% recycled materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all… and excellent daily lotion that is great for the whole family.</li>
    <li> I rely on this lotion!  I have eczema on my hands and this lotion does not irritate or make me itch like others I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve already purchased a second bottle and will be trying other products by this company.</li>
    <li> I love this hand lotion. I have used it for at least 5 years. It soaks into the skin nicely.</li>
