Lol&lt;br /&gt;I liked that the seller wrapped the polish in paper in case the Polish had a mishap. Thank you</li>
    <li> Very nice nail polish that is a pretty color, but not at all as pretty as this photo would lead you to believe.&lt;br /&gt;More brown.</li>

    <li> Love the color.  Love OPI nail polish.</li>
    <li> I choose this for the color.  Not a shade I find easily at my nail salon.  Normally OPI is my preference for polish but this seemed like it may have been a little old.  It was thicker and didn&#x27;t  glid on like OPI usually does.  I do like the prices on Amazon and would order more polish by this method.  It came in the time it said it would.  Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to really know how the color will work on your nails but it comes close enough to purchase.</li>
    <li> Very nice color for all seasons.</li>
    <li> Just as described and shipped timely and packaged well. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this color.  Always looking for neutral nail colors to match everything and this definitely fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> The color was very dark, not at all close to the color pictured.</li>
    <li> long time lover of the product.</li>

    <li> Love love love this nail polish!!  Great color, though not quite as pictured. It is a bit darker. But this is my favorite OPI up to date. I have pale skin with a reddish pigment, and this is perfect for me.</li>
