      <li>It can also fit on your masters or phat masters.</li>
      <li>Authentic model matched product fast shipping and fair price better than your local Beauty Supply store.</li>
      <li>Great blades but be careful, when doing fades or crew cuts where as you place the blade on the skin they will grab or dig into the skin.</li>
      <li>They work great and are extremely sharp.</li>
      <li>keeps the tape up fade crisp and precise</li>
      <li>right.</li>
      <li>The new one cuts cleanly with no pulling.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m glad I finally got it.</li>
      <li>Otherwise I love them, I brought some of these back in the 90&#x27;s,  </li>
      <li>if you&#x60;re a busy barber like myself and work fast take some sandpaper and stand your blade upright with the teeth down on sandpaper with a slight angle left and right glide your blade across it, this will take the sharp edge off the top of your teeth so they will glide smoothly on the scalp, GREAT BLADE FOR FADING and DETAIL WORK!!!!!!!</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m a professional barber and was surprised this happened.</li>
      <li>Some have suggested a light sanding or buffing of the edge of the blade to round the teeth.</li>
      <li>No good it breaks on the first use!!!</li>
      <li>and I would be interested in purchasing other things.</li>
      <li>This is the only blade to use for that professional look.  </li>

    <li> It masters the fade what can I say.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and works to perfection. I am able to provide barbershop quality fades. I would reccomend this to anyone looking for that one good blade to blend a fade.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t received my blade but this blade is sharp please for people.that Don&#x27;t cut hair everyday please cautious because you could cut someone head off please I rate this a 4 because not anyone can use this blade just take it slow the first time around  thank you and God bless</li>
    <li> Excellent for fading and tapering. It can also fit on your masters or phat masters. You must be careful with this blade due to the fact it cuts so close.</li>
    <li> love em!  keeps the tape up fade crisp and precise</li>
    <li> Can this fit the phat master</li>
    <li> Works great very sharp will buy again if I break another blade lol</li>
    <li> This is the only blade to use for that professional look.  Andis is top of the line. We have been using this blade for over 30 years.</li>
    <li> Great blades but be careful, when doing fades or crew cuts where as you place the blade on the skin they will grab or dig into the skin. Some have suggested a light sanding or buffing of the edge of the blade to round the teeth. Otherwise I love them, I brought some of these back in the 90&#x27;s,  I think they used to call these blades surgical back then.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a barber. With all barbers saying that the fade blade cuts closer. I decided to give it a try. Instead of buying a new Andis Fade Master. I was told that if you buy a fade blade and put it on an Andis Master, it&#x27;s basically an Andis Fade Master. It cuts so close that it can chew up your clipper guards. If there&#x27;s a way not to chew up your guards then this review would be 5 stars. That&#x27;s my only flaw</li>
    <li> Authentic model matched product fast shipping and fair price better than your local Beauty Supply store.</li>
    <li> Good replacement blade</li>
    <li> Very sharp, in the closest setting it will cut your skin.</li>
    <li> Ive used the blade for several years now cutting hair and it is great</li>
    <li> It was everything I thought it would be. It arrived on time too. Thank you and I would be interested in purchasing other things.</li>
    <li> No good it breaks on the first use!!!</li>
    <li> Great blade but I need a new one already.</li>
    <li> Blades broke after 2 months. I&#x27;m a professional barber and was surprised this happened.</li>
    <li> Attached this to my regular Andis Master clipper and works just great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for a few years now and just couldn&#x27;t get that fade right. I started checking out some online videos and everybody was suggesting these blades. I purchased the Andis Masters and bought the fade blade to interchange and it&#x27;s working out perfect. This gets that skin tight fade I&#x27;ve been going for and I highly recommend these. They came in new condition and before the date guaranteed by the vendor. These are a must have.</li>
    <li> This is the blade that you need to blend with.  this blade will make your skin fade look flawless.  it cuts super close and blends out them tough spots.</li>
    <li> A week late and received the wrong item.</li>
    <li> People please know how to use this blade before writing bad reviews about it, this is a surgical blade meaning it cut close so set your blade properly to prevent biting, next notice the blade is flat meaning lay flat against the head while cutting to prevent from snagging the scalp and another way to stop that if you&#x60;re a busy barber like myself and work fast take some sandpaper and stand your blade upright with the teeth down on sandpaper with a slight angle left and right glide your blade across it, this will take the sharp edge off the top of your teeth so they will glide smoothly on the scalp, GREAT BLADE FOR FADING and DETAIL WORK!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Top of the line quality.  Very impressed in the promptness I received my order.  I&#x27;ve been without my blade for a while but I&#x27;m glad I finally got it.</li>
    <li> Great products. Way to go Andis!</li>
    <li> Item as described. I dropped my clippers so I had to replace. Top and bottom blade were easy to change. Back on business.</li>
    <li> I get a clean a clean fade every time! Defiantly would recommend this product!!!!!!!! I would buy again and again</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed to replace my broken item that I had dropped on the floor.  The new one cuts cleanly with no pulling.  I will replace them more often.</li>
    <li> It was as expected.  They work great and are extremely sharp.</li>
    <li> they are too sharp cut one of my client. when i  was putting them on i even cut my self the blades are almost razor type</li>
