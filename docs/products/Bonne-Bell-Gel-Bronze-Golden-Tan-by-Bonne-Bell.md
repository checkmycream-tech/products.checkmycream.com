<li> The only thing that sort of sucks is that it dries fast</li>
<li> only thing is that its not really dark, it just adds a little bit of color.</li>
<li> so you have to work with it really fast or will dry kinda patchy, but if you screw up you just wet your skin a little</li>

<li> Just a little bit on my cheeks</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a very long time, but it&#x27;s VERY hard to find.</li>
<li> makes me look like I have a little tan!</li>
<li> If it goes out of business, I&#x27;m in trouble!</li>
<li> this product is so hard to find.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great little product.  It is easier to apply by mixing it with additional face cream.  It goes on smoother and can have the&lt;br /&gt;benefit of an spf. since the gel does not come with it already added.</li>
    <li> This is just a product that gives the the wearer some healthy color. I order it because it not always available in stores.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Bonne Bell Gel Golden Tan. It applies smoothly and easily and gives me a nice glow.</li>
    <li> This is actually a purchase I made for my husband (hold your laughter!)  He has been using Clinique products since the dawn of time. He takes very good care of himself. He was buying their Men&#x27;s Bronzer to the tune of 24-28$ for just over an ounce. I found this maddening, because he over uses all product, and wipes most of it off. (Bear in mind, he smears this expensive potion on his bald head!) Then the unthinkable happened. Macy&#x27;s ran out of his bronzer!! He was in a complete panic. He was almost unrecognizable with his pale, winter complexion &amp; sad affect. Then I remembered Bonne Bell from my teenage years, but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. He was growing desperate, trying to substitute bronzer with foundation! (Oh that was hysterical &amp; I took photos) So, I started searching for a solution, double time.  I was fearfully he may sink into a deep depression if he didn&#x27;t get his bronze fix. Boom! Amazon had it. I ordered 2 dark &amp; 2 light for the cost of 1 tube of the department store stuff. His eyes lit up like a child on Christmas when the boxes arrived! He is still using too much, but he doesn&#x27;t take correction to his make-up application very well. So I say, use two squirts, bronze that big ole head! Whatever keeps him happy. He&#x27;d die if anyone knew he had more products in his drawer than I do, but I don&#x27;t mind. Just as long as he shares!</li>
    <li> aRRIVED ON TIME.gOOD PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for years. I have tried other &amp;#34;gel bronzers&amp;#34; that came with a high dollar price and didn&#x27;t like them as much as this one. I don&#x27;t like foundations and this product is lightweight and gives a great glow! Only disappointment is I can&#x27;t find in stores.</li>
    <li> makes me look like I have a little tan! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Always liked this bronzer. Does a good job moisturizing my face and adding just a touch of color. I would pay extra though if they threw in some sunscreen. Happy with purchase though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this product can no longer be found in stores, but I am happy to be able to purchase it here. I have been using this gel for over twenty years and it is perfect for a little boost of color in the winter... Or for a deeper sun kissed look in the summer. It is light weight and never looks fake. Perfect alone or under make up.</li>
    <li> Nice &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; appearance with this product. Love for face mixed in with some lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I use it all over. Only wish it would come in larger tubes.&lt;br /&gt;Buy online due to stores not carrying the product any longer. Thx Amazon!</li>
    <li> Have loved this for years but can no longer find it in the drugstore. Great alone or for mixing with makeup in summer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years...love it!  It is the right amount of color..looks sun kissed.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the Bonne Bell Gel Bronze Golden Tan and I use it as my base in the summertime to give my skin a nice bronze color and glow.  It is not a stain but washes off just like regular makeup.</li>
    <li> This is a great product which I&#x27;ve been using for years.  It gives a beautiful warm transparent glow to the skin.  I sometimes use it alone and at other times over a lightweight foundation.  I get lots of compliments on my skin thanks to Bonne Bell.  Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this product!!!!!  I&#x27;d buy a case of it if I thought it was going to be discontinued!</li>
    <li> Looked for this in regular venues and all were out .......found it here for 1/2 of what I was paying. I&#x27;m very happy</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years...still love it the best</li>
    <li> I have used this for years to adjust the shade of my foundation as I get sun. Why have 5 shades of foundation when you can custom adjust the shade of one by adding bronzer gel? :) It blends beautifully with all different foundations I&#x27;ve tried, as well as with moisturizer. It feels clean and weightless. The color is a nice natural golden brown tan - not at all orange or unnaturally dark. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love tis stuff!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a very long time, but it&#x27;s VERY hard to find.</li>
    <li> I have looked everywhere for this stuff! In Wal-Mart, Target, Kmart, Ulta, drug stores, anywhere that Bonne Bell might be sold! This gel and the bronzing powder are my favorite bronzers and I have been going without for over 2 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to be able to get it in Wal-Mart or Target for less than $6. It used to be $4.99 at Wal-Mart about 4-5 years ago. On Amazon this 2 pack is the best deal (with shipping costs, it comes to about $13 for 2, and other sellers are selling this for about $10 for just 1 tube) since this is so hard to find in stores. One tube lasts a while if used sparingly, so it&#x27;s worth it if you really love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really fair skinned and I don&#x27;t tan. I use bronzers in the summertime to give myself a sun-kissed look. This gel bronzer is one of my favorites because it provides a shimmer-less color that is buildable and long lasting. The only thing that sort of sucks is that it dries fast so you have to work with it really fast or will dry kinda patchy, but if you screw up you just wet your skin a little and it&#x27;ll fix it. You can blend it in with your foundation as well, to add a little more color to your face if you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t want to tan your face or wear a self tanner on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a good long while if you blend with foundation or set it with powder. It&#x27;s gel and not a cream, so it kind of soaks into your skin a little bit so it doesn&#x27;t rub off and it lasts all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that its not really dark, it just adds a little bit of color. The gel is dark (and only comes in one color), but when you apply it, it&#x27;s really light. But you can build it to the color you want.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really sorry this product is so hard to find.  It gives a smooth light tan color.  It spreads on easy and last long.</li>
    <li> I have been using his bronzer for years and now I can&#x27;t find it in any local stores - happy to find it on Amazon.  It goes on smooth and washes off easy.  It makes me look like I have been in the sun, but not fake looking.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, I&#x27;ve used it for MANY years.  It  gives a nice natural glow without the sticky makeup feel.</li>
    <li> Got here quick was just what I ordered. I have looked all over for this product and it cannot be found in any store. Great quality and I would buy again from this dealer.</li>
    <li> I am medium brown skinned, and I like to have a glow.  I tend to be a little gray when I am tired, and who doesn&#x27;t love the after beach glow? This is how you get it.  It looks natural, and it&#x27;s easy to use. it&#x27;s not sparkly, shimmery, and fake looking - you use just a dab and you look refreshed, relaxed and like you spent the weekend or last night in the Caymans.  Now that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talking about!  I won&#x27;t be without it! Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. Thank God for Amazon and this seller!</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years. Difficult to find in stores so am SO happy Amazon carries it. It gives a natural glow to skin and depth of shade can be adjusted depending on how much product you apply. Blends well into foundation or onto moisturized skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel bronzer for over 30 years now - this is a MUST HAVE in my makeup kit!  Just a little bit on my cheeks and I get a nice sun kissed look.  Great price from seller</li>
    <li> A hint of color without the look of pasty foundation.  Never leave the house without this on. Easy to apply with no streaks.</li>
    <li> Love this product for the past 40 years.  Naturally as you may guess I now have wrinkles and it doesn&#x27;t  show them up.</li>
    <li> I used this in high school and even then it was sometimes tricky to find. It provides a nice bronzy glow without making your face look dirty (which is my issue with most powder bronzers). A little goes a long way, and if you don&#x27;t rub it in quickly, it does leave a little spot where you put the gel on.</li>
    <li> ... but I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time; find I can just dab it in the palm of my hand, add a tiny bit of water, &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; my face with it,&lt;br /&gt;get a little sun tone quickly, add some blush and go. (It never produces an odd orange-y, artificial tan!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a major make-up ritual doesn&#x27;t fit your schedule and you need a little natural color, this one&#x27;s for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company&#x27;s weak distribution pattern makes this very hard to find -- and the packaging could use some improvement.  Would be nice to find it in a larger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Service from the online vendor was fine!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. I Love this stuff, but sooooo hard to find!  Glad I know where to get it.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years and now the only place I can find it is on Amazon.com. They used to sell it in the drugstores, but they don&#x27;t anymore.  Great product that gives just a touch of tan in the middle of the winter when I look too pale.</li>
    <li> Have used this clear bronzer for YEARS, and it&#x27;s getting VERY hard to find in stores!  Just love that it&#x27;s not a cake foundation, just a clean sheen of color.  Look tan not &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34;.  If it goes out of business, I&#x27;m in trouble!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Have been using Bonne Bell bronzer for more years than I care to admit.  Just love this stuff.  Very affordable and natural looking.</li>
    <li> My mom&#x27;s friend turned me on to this product when I was 13 years old and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. I am now 40 (and fabulous)!</li>
