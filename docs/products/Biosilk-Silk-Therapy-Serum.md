<li> My husband has sensitive skin, so he uses it on his face, legs, and arms as well as his hair.....</li>
<li> We&#x27;ve used other products that promise to do the same, example: shiny, lustrous, soft manageable hair, but they don&#x27;t....</li>
<li> flyaway, slightly wavy, easily tangled, breakage prone, split ends, slow to grow, and i dont dye or heat style my hair.</li>
<li> but i havent been using it long enough..</li>
<li> /&gt;the container should really allow it to dispense some other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;weighs hair down (pro for me, but con maybe for some curly haired girls)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> i initially tried this on dry hair years ago and thought it was</li>
<li> then i read reviews and tried it on wet hair</li>
<li> use a dime size or less even on long hair, trust me.</li>
<li> you&#x27;ve tried this dry and disliked it, try it wet.</li>
<li> i also have extremely oily roots.</li>
<li> other people smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> flyaway hair down (a pro for me)&lt;br</li>
<li> hair way less frizzy</li>
<li> /&gt;it hasnt dried out my hair yet</li>
<li> Hardly anything was missing and the bottle was slippery but nothing to complain about.  </li>
<li> I was shocked at the low price I found here.</li>
<li> he claims that his gray hair isn&#x27;t as gray...but sad to say, it still is.  </li>
<li> really* bad.</li>

    <li> great product at best price i&#x27;ve found</li>
    <li> Great item.  Just as described!  Great packaging. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> Fast Service and as advertised</li>
    <li> Love it, been using it for years.  Will not make the hair oily at all but will moisturize and will make your hair sheen very good.  I put some on after I shower at night and then in the morning.  If needed I mix it a little bit with some hair gel and it makes my hair shine nicely and prevents the gel from becoming brittle and flaky.  Works great with hair spray as well.</li>
    <li> my hair is very fine, flyaway, slightly wavy, easily tangled, breakage prone, split ends, slow to grow, and i dont dye or heat style my hair. i also have extremely oily roots. now onto the product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;makes hair shiny&lt;br /&gt;makes hair way less frizzy&lt;br /&gt;makes my hair straighter and healthier looking&lt;br /&gt;super soft hair&lt;br /&gt;weighs flyaway hair down (a pro for me)&lt;br /&gt;does not make my hair greasy (the way i use it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;smells exactly like rave hair spray. i do not know what this peachy nice smell is that other people smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the container should really allow it to dispense some other way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;weighs hair down (pro for me, but con maybe for some curly haired girls)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very very easy to overdo it. use a dime size or less even on long hair, trust me. dont apply to roots especially if you have oily hair but thats obvious&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it breaks me out on my neck, back and sides of jaw but not sure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it hasnt dried out my hair yet but i havent been using it long enough..i initially tried this on dry hair years ago and thought it was *really* bad. then i read reviews and tried it on wet hair and i am so glad i did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;ve tried this dry and disliked it, try it wet. i only give it four stars because its not foolproof, you have to tweak your method until it works for you.</li>
    <li> Excellent, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  It has so many more uses other than just to use in your hair!  My husband has sensitive skin, so he uses it on his face, legs, and arms as well as his hair.....he claims that his gray hair isn&#x27;t as gray...but sad to say, it still is.  lol  We&#x27;ve used other products that promise to do the same, example: shiny, lustrous, soft manageable hair, but they don&#x27;t....Biosilk actually does what it claims!  Recommend Biosilk Silk Therapy to all!</li>
