      <li>Can&#x27;t wait to buy more :)  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t tingle which I love, and I saw immediate results.</li>
      <li>It looked and felt better</li>

      <li>My favorite part has to be the sparkles though, bottom line - if you just want a cute lotion, this is it.</li>
      <li>I am in love.</li>
      <li>but I kinda wanted to be more sparkly.</li>
      <li>I used a sample at my salon and immediately fell in love with this product.</li>
      <li>Ok so I tried a trial packet of Going GaGa tanning lotion  </li>
      <li>I order this every year and love it.</li>
      <li>Looking forward to getting more, since I like to switch them up.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, great price.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite tanning lotion.  </li>
      <li>Their original tanning lotion is by far the best..</li>
      <li>It has a nice sweet smell.  </li>
      <li>My only suggestion would be to add more bronzers to make it a deeper tan, but if you&#x27;re looking for a light tan and to sparkle and smell delicious, this is a must!</li>
      <li>The lotion smells real good, the glitter is a little overwhelming, but as a bronzer in general not the best.</li>
      <li>I recommend this for new tanners, because you do get some great color off of it.</li>
      <li>I am pretty fair skinned and burn easily.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite lotion and I will buy it again!!</li>
      <li>One day I tried a packet of &amp;#34;Going GAGA&amp;#34; and I LOVED it so much, and ordered a bottle of it that day.</li>
      <li>Smells really good and is very &amp;#34;glittery&amp;#34;..</li>
      <li>recommend this lotion for anyone who likes shimmer and a nice, golden glow.</li>
      <li>Smells good but doesn&#x27;t really help accelerate tanning.</li>
      <li>I found if you use it right before entering a tanning bed, the lotion kind of just tans, then it seems to rub off.</li>
      <li>I really like this product, and I love the smell its not too overwhelming!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s where I originally found it and fell in love with the product but not the price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product works well, I would give it a higher rating if it had a bit less shimmer/glitter and fragrance.</li>
    <li> I just got this lotion today and used it, and OMG. I am in love. I am very fair. I&#x27;m Irish, need I say more? And this bronzed me after the first use. I had been using the regular Australian Gold Dark Tanning Accelerator, and it did well, but this is on a whole other level. You have to remember too everyone tans different, but I will say I will be purchasing this again and again and again. I LOVE IT. The sparkles to me are very subtle, nothing like Edward Twilight Sparkle lol It smells fantastic. The other tanning lotion I mentioned has a orange cicle smell, but after you tan it STINKS, not this. After tanning in a high pressure bed for 7 min it smelled great! I would recommend this to anyone. It doesn&#x27;t tingle which I love, and I saw immediate results. Worth every penny. Also please know as well not only does this yield immediate results, but it is also a delayed bronzer which means it keeps working long after the tanning session!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks now (3 x a week), and it did the job for this really pale girl. I&#x27;m not dark bronze, but am much noticeably darker. Its def a good starter lotion. Ive used lotions in the past that made me streaky because they bronzed too intensely for my skin color, but this did not do that. I also like the smell a lot, and it has a nice little shimmer.</li>
    <li> I just bought this and used it for the first time tonight when I went tanning... I LOVE this lotion!!! It smells amazinggg, my skin doesn&#x27;t smell fried! I love that it has glitter in it, gives a good shimmer to your skin and the bronzer in it is the best!!! I went to Florida a month ago and got an amazing tan and have been trying to maintain it and this stuff makes me look SO dark! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I had used Believe in the past and was not too thrilled with it because it always seemed to leave me red.  This lotion does not do that.  I come out of the bed looking bronzed and not red!  I like the smell because it is not too overbearing.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling burnt when I get done tanning.  The sparkles are a little much, but you can brush them off with a towel when you are done tanning.</li>
    <li> Ok so I tried a trial packet of Going GaGa tanning lotion  but it left me with a poker face. Australian Gold must have been bluffing with my muffin or stunning with thier love glue gunning by naming it GAGA! ,cause I was not to impressed...to start it  has a bubble gum/bannana scent whitch isn&#x27;t so bad BUT the Shimmer in the lotion is more like large pieces of silver glitter. Although the \\&quot;shimmer\\&quot; was a little tacky looking I did like the bronzed color I got.  I didn&#x27;t notice any visible streaks the next day. Its thick in consistency. I would only use this again if I was on my way to \\&quot;da club!\\&quot; and wanted to smell super sweet and powdery!</li>
    <li> The best part of this lotion has to be the shimmer and the way it made my skin feel.  I had a good bronze color, not as dark as I had wanted, but once I got out of the bed my skin was shimmering and and really soft.  It looked and felt better then I had expected.  My skin looked bright and healthy, which doesn&#x27;t always happen with other lotions.  The smell was pleasant and lingered on hours after I tanned.</li>
    <li> The lotion smells real good, the glitter is a little overwhelming, but as a bronzer in general not the best. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion 2 times now and can already see a difference.  It has a nice sweet smell.  And I like the sparkles.  So far I am feeling gaga over this lotion.  Would buy it again!</li>
    <li> Product arrived a little later than expected, but the product itself is great! It gives you a great instant tan, and does not leave you smelling like a tanning salon.</li>
    <li> The smell of this product is yummy but I don&#x27;t like the sparkles....they&#x27;re annoying and seem to get everywhere. Also, I always feel sticky after getting done tanning and it might just be me but I cannot stand when I feel like there is something thick on my skin, it makes my skin crawl!  Overall, I would not recommend this product. Spend a little more and get something from Designer Skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she likes it a lot. I believe this is the second time we bought this, and both times it came in fast, and is a quality product.</li>
    <li> loved the lotion it gives one a little glimmer to your body afterwards, and it has a mild sweet fragrance.</li>
    <li> before you tan and its so cute and glittery , also it gets you REALLY dark with the bronzers in it. However in my opinion the Good smell before tanning and glitter is a waste because to me it smells pretty bad AFTER tanning, either way Ill finish up the bottle but I prob wouldn&#x27;t re-purchase.</li>
    <li> While I am not too crazy about Lady Gaga- (Sorry if I offended anyone)- this is great lotion. I bought it because of the shimmer, and it is just that, shimmer- not glitter. So that was a relief. I already have a pretty decent base tan, so I can&#x27;t say for sure if it made me any tanner- but it does smell good, before and after tanning, in my opinion. Also the bronzer didn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes. So for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it! Looking forward to getting more, since I like to switch them up.</li>
    <li> This Lotion seemed expired/old. The smell is nice after using it in the bed. Very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion.  It smells great, and I never get that burnt smell that some lotions tend to give off after tanning.  It has subtle sparkles mixed in the lotion which help give skin a glowing look.  The bronzer in the lotion isn&#x27;t going to make you look like you have been fake tanning for ages.  It helps give you a natural looking tan, and it never leaves streaks.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this lotion!</li>
    <li> I have used several indoor tanning lotions, but GaGa by AG is not for me. I was blotchy after using it for 2weeks. I went to the beds reg. but noticed I wasn&#x27;t tanning as usual. I purchased a bottle of a perv. lotion that I used and noticed color the first time I used it. I think that some lotions are body chemistry specific or skin type. I am pretty fair skinned and burn easily. I have heard great things about GaGa but I don&#x27;t think it is for everyone.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different tanners with and without tingle to get a semi tan on my pale skin. This product has no tingle (which I like) and started to darken my skin up right away. Within 4 sessions of using this I was the darkest I had ever been in my life! Will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion; the sparkles are fun, it smells good, and it gives me a nice bronzed look even right after leaving the bed!!    Can&#x27;t wait to buy more :)  Also, came two days after buying it, so I had no time to waste before using it :)</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this bottle at a tanning salon, and I was skeptical at first. But I fell in love with the shimmer and the color it gave me! When I ran out, I had to purchase a different brand since the salon didn&#x27;t sell this brand, and I hated it. That&#x27;s when I decided to look on Amazon, and thank goodness they had it! It&#x27;s the exact same bottle and formula as the original I bought, came quickly and sealed. I used it today, and already I have that nice golden glow that the other brand didn&#x27;t give me. I love everything about this tanning lotion, and will definitely buy again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this lotion for anyone who likes shimmer and a nice, golden glow. The scent is fruity, but not overpowering and never smells like I just tanned. Scent stays for a while, and the tan lasts for a long time too!</li>
    <li> I was doing research for a new inexpensive tanning lotion, overall the reviews were good for this one and I&#x27;m glad I got it. It&#x27;s inexpensive, smell good, and helps get me tan. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have purchased two of these bottles. This tanning lotion smells so good and it has some shimmer to it, but not too much. I started seeing results in a week. I&#x27;ve been using this for my body and I bought the Snooki legs inhibitor for my legs. So far so great! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I work at a tanning salon and this by far my FAV lotion. Doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky or gross after tanning, feels like a regular lotion except it shimmers! awesome product!</li>
    <li> After reading multiple reviews I had to try AG Going Ga Ga, it was shipped super fast, in a sealed bottle. Arrived 3 days before expected delivery date!!!!! I couldnt wait to go tanning and try this product. There is glitter in this lotion, but it is not overpowering, it is a shimmer of glitter you can see when light reflects off of your arms and legs. So I wanted to be able to say this is AWESOME lotion, but I just cant! I definitely got color from only one use, and I dont notice streaks or lines where I might have not put it on evenly! This is a Plus, but while laying in the bed my face started to tingle and felt like I was burning! I have never felt like that during tanning! And I noticed a red rash on my stomach after tanning. This morning the rash is gone, but the color has lasted! So I am not sure of this product yet, I will try alternating it between my designer skin lotion, and hopefully will not break out again! If you have sensitive skin, be careful! But if you want a dark tan fast, this product did deliever fast n streak free!!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion as a sample packet. I usually use Devoted products. I love Australian Gold too. This one I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with. Lotions with shimmer are my fav. The smell didn&#x27;t change after tanning which was nice but through out the day I got more put off by it.</li>
    <li> love the glitter and the scent</li>
    <li> i bought this lotion and really liked it, got a nice deep dark overall tan! when i bought a monthly package at my salon i purchased a different lotion at a discounted price so i started to use that and was noticing that my face wasnt gettin as dark as the rest of my body and/or the color was fading fast so i use this now specifically for my face and my color is dark and lasts def recommend and will buy again</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the sparkles, but I had the same problem with the greasy feeling as I did the last lotion I bought from Australian gold. I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell of this lotion, it wasn&#x27;t bad, but it wasn&#x27;t my favorite. I like the cupcake one better. If you use this one before you leave your house then go tanning it works great. I found if you use it right before entering a tanning bed, the lotion kind of just tans, then it seems to rub off. I recommend this for new tanners, because you do get some great color off of it. That seems to be a good constant from Australian Gold, and the price is always good.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why but this stuff burns my face. I can&#x27;t use it on my neck or higher or starts to burn like fire but it works fabulous on the rest of the body... It&#x27;s filled with sparkles so it&#x27;s either that or the perfume but it doesn&#x27;t bother any other part of my body?! I had a friend try and it did the same to her, only on her face. weird? It smells nice too tho lol</li>
    <li> I really like this product, and I love the smell its not too overwhelming! This is my new favorite lotion and I will buy it again!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Australian Gold for YEARS.. Their original tanning lotion is by far the best.. I bought this just to try something different and I&#x27;m pleased.  Smells really good and is very &amp;#34;glittery&amp;#34;.. Will probably purchase again.</li>
    <li> Worked great. Smells good. has a pretty shimmer after tanning session. See a different after first color. Would buy again. Any Australian gold tanning lotion is good.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a cheap tanning lotion with sparkles in it this is it. I love the shimmer in this bottle. It shines like the sun on your skin!</li>
    <li> was expecting more. . Doesn&#x27;t really work. . The bronzers that is.  Snooki is Def the way to go. I&#x27;m glad I tried it. . Wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> It gets you dark fast and leaves a shimmering sparkly glow. I really Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I just bought something else and im disappointed i should of searched for what i had before THIS ONE.</li>
    <li> I began back at the beds after a long winter of not tanning. I signed up for a basic bed membership,so right there you should know I am not getting the strongest UV rays already. But I picked GAGA because frankly it was the cheapest. I was really pleased that I saw a significant base tan form after a couple uses in the basic bed. I am fair skinned naturally, but have no problems tanning. This does not have tingle (I don&#x27;t like tingle) or warmer in it. It does smell good...too me, it smells like the old Limited Too lip gloss that we had as little girls. It has this sweet, fruity smell. It also leaves these little glitters all over you and they are discreet, but pretty. It doesn&#x27;t leave streaks, and I don&#x27;t even apply it evenly! I like this lotion and would recommend it to people with fair-skin, who just want a nice, natural, base tan. For me, I am ready to move on to a deeper, darker tan now and am looking into trying some of the Designer Skin line. Hopefully that works nicely too! Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve decided no more tanning lotions w/o a UV protectant included so I added a UV protector of 30 myself</li>
    <li> Extremely satisfied with this lotion. I do not tan easily and this gives me a nice bronze look just days after use. I would definitely recommend. Fast shipping, great price.</li>
    <li> Love it! And way cheaper than buying from the tanning salon. That&#x27;s where I originally found it and fell in love with the product but not the price. It has shimmer in it, which I love, and the smell is great.</li>
    <li> Great bronzer I use it when I&#x27;m planning on going out . If your wanting a dark lotion with shimmer then I would recommend this</li>
    <li> I thought this stuff would have some sparkles in it.  If there are any, they must be on the bottom of the bottle.  It does smell nice though, and I&#x27;ll keep it because it smells nice, but I won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> This lotion smells really great when you put it on, after tanning- not so much. It has that burnt tanning smell that so many other lotions have. I couldn&#x27;t really see any results, the \\&quot;bronzers\\&quot; were not the greatest. It didn&#x27;t get me very dark at all. My favorite part has to be the sparkles though, bottom line - if you just want a cute lotion, this is it. If you&#x27;re wanting a serious tan, choose something else.</li>
    <li> Worst tanning lotion ever, I&#x27;ve been tanning for 4years and have used around 15 diffrent lotions and this has been the worst I have ever used in smell/texture/color. First I loveeee shimmer and that&#x27;s the main reason why I got this tanning lotion but I realized when I used it it had NO shimmer just pieces of white&amp;gray chunks of glitter not shimmer and just a little of that! Second it stinks like candy (when I went back to school on my school lunch break someone told me I smelled like cupcakes) and absolutely no color from this whats so ever like at all, I have used cheap walmart lotions that give better results than this junk! I disliked it so much that instead of using it for tanning beds I used it this Summer when I went to the beach or lake..... I told the girls at Tanning salon that I hate this lotion and they told me that noone ever buys that lotion in there salon that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s always on sale and sometime even free when purchase of another lotion. If you want some great smelling lotion that gives greattttt results buy TAO from DesignerSkin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m your typical girly-girl..a total glitter addict. If you are not a fan of glitter, this lotion is NOT for you.&lt;br /&gt; The smell is not strong, but it is sweet. I notice an immediate change of pale to BRONZE as soon as I step out of the tanning bed. The only reason I do not rate this 5 stars is because I feel like as soon as I shower my dark bronze fades out..</li>
    <li> Smells great nice shimmer but I just like more bronzer in my lotions was worth the money on a start up tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> This lotion has a decent smell (as far as lotions go) and with the extra sparkle, makes it my favorite yet.</li>
    <li> I decided to go tanning for a month to get a nice base tan for when I go on my trip to florida. I do not want to burn when I get down there. The guy at the tanning salon recommended this to me. Now I tan pretty easily and I am now just getting dark. The shade I am at now was where I was at when I used a intensifying bronzer a year ago. It took me 2 weeks to get this shade with this product when I normally get this shade in 4-5 days. I am not a fan of all the glitter either. I would recommend trying another lotion. This isn&#x27;t the greatest if you want faster results.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it made me any more tan but it smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird residue on you.  I bought it especially for the sparkles, and maybe this is just me but I kinda wanted to be more sparkly.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion!! It smells good, it&#x27;s not to heavy and the sparkling sets off your skin!! I will only buy a few kinds and this is my favorite. It shipped and arrived on time. Well worth the price. Great job! Will order from here again if they have the lotions I use!! Thank you sooooo much!!!</li>
    <li> i absolutely love the glitter and the smell! wont streak you and will give you decent color! one of my favs!</li>
    <li> Love the subtle sparkles, smells lovely, im super pale butthis gave me some color right after my first tan.. And you can&#x27;t ignore the cute name of this product lol it is the only tanning lotion I really like everything else gets you blotchy uneven color/tint... Tingles? Umm who needs that ?? Lol</li>
    <li> The lotion has a very pleasant smell that carries through even after you tan. I don&#x27;t get any of the burnt smell allot of lotions have after you tan.&lt;br /&gt;The color pay off is really nice as well without leaving the finger webbing orange</li>
    <li> After just using this product once my skin noticably darkened, the smell is great and has just a little shimmer which I love.</li>
    <li> I love using this lotion. It leaves a gorgeous shimmer on my skin and it smells fantastic. Would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone! It doesn&#x27;t give you a fake orange looking tan, it looks natural. My only suggestion would be to add more bronzers to make it a deeper tan, but if you&#x27;re looking for a light tan and to sparkle and smell delicious, this is a must!</li>
    <li> gave me a good tan, smells good, but didnt care for the glitter in it. Id still recommend this though.</li>
    <li> I usually switch between a few different lotions, but I definitely like this one. It works well and smells really good.</li>
    <li> Smells great and even leaves glitter on you!! So if you like a good lotion that helps you tan and even gives you a little glitter than this is for you!!</li>
    <li> Used it for a while last summer.  Was good product.  Got product availability from a friend who uses it all the time,.  Might order again.  Right now I still  have a new bottle and won&#x27;t need til next summer.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best tanning lotions I have ever used.  It will definitely make you very dark after one use.</li>
    <li> I was tired of spending tons of money on tanning lotions from the salon. One day I tried a packet of &amp;#34;Going GAGA&amp;#34; and I LOVED it so much, and ordered a bottle of it that day. It smells great, it&#x27;s shimmery and I can tell a huge difference every single time I use. Great product for the price!</li>
    <li> I have used this tanning lotion for awhile now and I love the results I get when using it! I tan faster and I like the shimmer in the lotion! Smells good too!</li>
    <li> Good tanning lotion for cheap love it</li>
    <li> i gotta give this product 5 stars! i am a big fan of australian gold because it works really well outside and their lotions never seem to make my skin feel gross. i am very pale with red hair and have never achieved a tan in my life until i used this! i got color very quickly within 1 use, it smelled wonderful, and it didnt turn out blotchy.</li>
    <li> I used a sample at my salon and immediately fell in love with this product. It has a very nice smell, it sparkles, and you can tell a difference within the first tanning session. I used it today and the guy at the tanning salon told me I was getting dark as I left. I bought two bottles; Ordered Friday, received Monday! All together a great buy!</li>
    <li> As long as you&#x27;re not looking to get bronze, this will do the trick. Smells a little weird though.</li>
    <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t really help accelerate tanning. I usually tan once a week to maintain tan but with this lotion I need to tan more often.</li>
    <li> I am very pale skinned and have always had trouble getting a pretty even tan.  I have spend countless dollars on other synthetic tanning products that are suppose to &amp;#34;intensify your tan&amp;#34; in the tanning bed.  To my dismay, I only ended up with an uneven tan and dark elbows and knees that looked like they were dirty.  Even the $80 - $90 dollar a bottle ones didn&#x27;t work.  Was very skeptical when I purchased this product but was EXTREMELY happy with it after just a few uses.  Not only did my tan look amazing (had MANY compliments) but I sparkled every time the light hit my skin.  The smell was an added benefit.  I didn&#x27;t smell like I had been in the tanning bed when I was done.  I never experienced the &amp;#34;burnt&amp;#34; smell other reviewers spoke of and I have been using the product for over 2 years now.  Will DEFINATELY continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> To be an inexpensive product this works great!!! I order this every year and love it. It really beats paying $65 plus for a bottle of tanning lotion.</li>
