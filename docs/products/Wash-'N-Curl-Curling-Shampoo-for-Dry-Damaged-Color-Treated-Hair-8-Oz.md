<ol>
      <li>VERY HAPPY WITH PURCHASE.</li>
      <li>Excellent buy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Shipping time was excellent.</li>
      <li>Use rollers/curlers for best results.</li>
      <li>Great for leaving your hair with body</li>
      <li>The shampoo is great.  </li>
      <li>She says it doing great.</li>
      <li>good product.</li>
      <li>love it works great.</li>
      <li>Lathers easy, cleans great and doesn&#x27;t strip my hair color.  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Mom couldn&#x27;t find this in her area,  so was able to send it to her.  </li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;suds up&amp;#34; like most shampoos, but maybe that is by design.  </li>
      <li>It has a very mild fragrance.  </li>
      <li>But my curl and color seem to be doing fine, so I&#x27;m going to give the product a thumbs up.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for short hair and saves time in styling your hair.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for my very fine hair.</li>
      <li>A product well worth buying in quatity if you need it on hand quick!</li>
      <li>I had some curl, but ever time after that just little unnoticeable wave but mostly fly away frizz.</li>
      <li>I could no longer find it locally and was thrilled to get it online.</li>
      <li>My mom and I love this product and can no longer find it in local stores in the St. Louis area.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, test</li>
      <li>It works great for people with damage dry curly wavy hair only.  </li>
      <li>I loved it at first, but it dried my hair out so much, I had to stop using it.</li>
      <li>Therefore, I had to use a conditioner...which I don&#x27;t generally need for my fine hair...and that seemed to diminish the curls and waves.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo,have usrd it for years and will continue as long as I can order it.</li>
      <li>It does seem to help a little when I first shampoo and style, but what I notice the most is that I have more volume the next day.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I have been using Wash N Curl for years now and really like it.  </li>
      <li>It really did not curl my hair as it promised.</li>
      <li>This shampoo really does what it advertises, but the downside is that it&#x27;s a very drying shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I love this gentle foaming shampoo, and it is starting to bring back the waves I had in my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve use it for years and bought case loads at a time through u where can I purchase at a decent normal price?</li>
      <li>Thus I don&#x27;t feel like my hair is as soft or as clean as with regular shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It makes it feel thicker and gives me volume, it enhances my natural waves.</li>
      <li>My hair stays in place even in humid weather which is generally what we have in Houston.</li>
      <li>This shampoo gives my naturally curl hair the extra boost it needs.  </li>
      <li>was I glad, because I only had a small amount left in the bottle that I bought a long time ago.</li>
      <li>My hair is very straight, and I was trying this to see if it would give me a little body.  </li>
      <li>Really works on my winter-time less curly hair</li>
      <li>and it only takes a very small amount to leave it clean and shiny</li>

    <li> WHAT?!! THIS STUFF MADE MY HAIR HARD...HUH?!!</li>
    <li> Hi. Nutra care pls. Bring this product back  I&#x27;m lost without it.  It works great for people with damage dry curly wavy hair only.  Nothing on the market like this formulation.  I&#x27;ve use it for years and bought case loads at a time through u where can I purchase at a decent normal price? Pls bring it back!!!!! E-mail !!!!!</li>
    <li> Really works on my winter-time less curly hair</li>
    <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t weigh my (very thin) hair down.  I have an oily scalp with drier ends.  It makes it feel thicker and gives me volume, it enhances my natural waves. Lathers easy, cleans great and doesn&#x27;t strip my hair color.  It has a very mild fragrance.  I  haven&#x27;t tried the conditioner yet, but I hope it works as well.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to have curly hair after shampooing; I was going for some extra volume. It does seem to help a little when I first shampoo and style, but what I notice the most is that I have more volume the next day. Not a lot, but enough that I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This did make my hair curlier but it also was drying. Therefore, I had to use a conditioner...which I don&#x27;t generally need for my fine hair...and that seemed to diminish the curls and waves. Use rollers/curlers for best results.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I&#x27;m disappointed that Walgreens by me stopped carrying it as I bought it often! It turns my slight waves into actual curls and I&#x27;ve had people ask me if I got a perm and I didn&#x27;t! I wish I can find this shampoo in the stores!!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo really does what it advertises, but the downside is that it&#x27;s a very drying shampoo.  I loved it at first, but it dried my hair out so much, I had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> I love this gentle foaming shampoo, and it is starting to bring back the waves I had in my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> This shampoo gives my naturally curl hair the extra boost it needs.  I always get complements on my hair.  Thanks</li>
    <li> My hair is very straight, and I was trying this to see if it would give me a little body.  I think it&#x27;s helped some.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, test I had some curl, but ever time after that just little unnoticeable wave but mostly fly away frizz.</li>
    <li> My mom and I love this product and can no longer find it in local stores in the St. Louis area.</li>
    <li> I could no longer find it locally and was thrilled to get it online. Excellent buy. I now have enough to last a very long time.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34; L O V E  I T ! &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have been using Wash N Curl for years now and really like it.  It&#x27;s great for short hair and saves time in styling your hair.  I have used Wash N Curl for at least 10 years and then I couldn&#x27;t find it in the supermarkets or drug stores.  I searched the web and found it on Amazon and boy was I glad, because I only had a small amount left in the bottle that I bought a long time ago.</li>
    <li> I could no longer find this at the grocery store. I bought two bottles.  I wash my hair and leave it on for about 5 minutes.  It does help make my hair curlier.</li>
    <li> love it works great. stinks a little but it don&#x27;t make your hair smell bad.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for my very fine hair.It really did not curl my hair as it promised. I have problem hair, and was hoping this would do the trick, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Great for leaving your hair with body and it only takes a very small amount to leave it clean and shiny</li>
    <li> I thought that I would give this a try, but it didn&#x27;t provide any extra curl.  As others have stated this is drying and I don&#x27;t have dry or curl-treated hair.  I thought that it would help in the humidity, but it did not.</li>
    <li> It does help the hair to hold curls.  I was skeptical, yet it does!  A product well worth buying in quatity if you need it on hand quick!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo,have usrd it for years and will continue as long as I can order it.Thanks so much.  Kay</li>
    <li> The shampoo is great.  My wife wanted this brand. She uses it exclusively.  She would recommend using the product.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping time was excellent.</li>
    <li> love the product but will never order it again because it has gotten to expensive!</li>
    <li> Gives me so much body that I desperately need. My hair stays in place even in humid weather which is generally what we have in Houston.</li>
    <li> good product. prompt delivery as promised.</li>
    <li> HARD TO FIND. VERY HAPPY WITH PURCHASE.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t curl my hair at all. I feel like I wasted the product bc you have to wash hair twice with it.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;suds up&amp;#34; like most shampoos, but maybe that is by design.  Thus I don&#x27;t feel like my hair is as soft or as clean as with regular shampoo.  But my curl and color seem to be doing fine, so I&#x27;m going to give the product a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Mom couldn&#x27;t find this in her area,  so was able to send it to her.  She says it doing great.</li>
    <li> Works to set curl but smells terrible.</li>
