      <li>I&#x27;ve used this great product before and have found it effective and non-irritating.</li>
      <li>really good-</li>
      <li>good knowing that i am putting all natural ingredients into my body and does not sting my face which is a miracle trust me!!- anyhow, thank-you to this company for making an all-natural product that is so effective- VERY HAPPY CUSTOMER HERE!!!</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve tried so many.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m sure that helped a bit, but I always use tea tree.</li>
      <li>This product is okay</li>
      <li>Works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
      <li>I must admit I am totally pleased.  </li>
      <li>I have noticed my tone is more even after 3 days</li>
      <li>I purchased more than one to get free shipping, I just have to use it continuously...</li>
      <li>it is light and goes on easily.</li>
      <li>i CANNOT believe how this little cream did that, but i am SOOOOO HAPPY!-</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Let me first say that I purchased this primarily for the texture and the way my skin felt after using it, not for skin lightening.</li>
      <li>There was one pretty good size age spot on my left side of my face.  </li>
      <li>They haven&#x27;t completely diappeared, but they look faded and much better now.</li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s made by natural herb, I&#x27;m pretty sure that it takes long time to get good result anyway.  </li>
      <li>It is funny because I had to think a minute to remember which side it was on.  </li>
      <li>I did use tea tree oil first, and then use the cream</li>
      <li>This is my first time try this cream.</li>
      <li>This is my first product review.  </li>
      <li>I am really just getting started</li>
      <li>I waited to write a review because I wanted to see if this skin lighter really worked</li>
      <li>I use it twice a day on my whole face and neck.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I cant really say how I feel about it yet</li>
      <li>I was hoping that I can see a little bit better result though.  </li>
      <li>but I found that it doesn&#x27;t really get rid of the spots completely.</li>
      <li>i bought this at whole foods because i like how everything is natural</li>
      <li>I bought this exact same product at whole foods yesterday-</li>
      <li>I tried the tester at Natural Grocers, I am very picky when it comes to facial moisturizer.</li>
      <li>This fits the bill completely.</li>
      <li>I like that it is all natural</li>
      <li>I used it twice a day for 6 weeks and not only did it not lighten whatsoever, but my brown spots look much darker when using this, and it doesn&#x27;t provide sufficient moisturizer to apply foundation over.</li>
      <li>it absorbs quickly, has no greasy residue, gives a good matte base for my make-up, makes me feel</li>
      <li>-i bought this cream because at 45 years and too many careless years in the sun, my face was starting to look pretty brown and spotted in places-</li>
      <li>It has to feel a certain way on my skin (not even remotely greasy), but supple, and has to not break me out.</li>
      <li>I got some other products and my skin is in the process of clearing up really well</li>
      <li>My skin has never looked better and the few dark spots that I had are all but gone!</li>
      <li>no long term effects seen</li>

    <li> Just started using this cream...it is light and goes on easily. So far so good.</li>
    <li> I bought this exact same product at whole foods yesterday- and it made my smaller, less severe acne and eczema scars basically disappear over night. I did use tea tree oil first, and then use the cream so I&#x27;m sure that helped a bit, but I always use tea tree. I&#x27;m giving it a 4 for now, just until it&#x27;s been a week or two and I can tell it it&#x27;s helped with my deeper acne scars! Is been using Khiels products for acne scars and age spots and not only did I see little results but it turned out they use aluminium in their products! Ick!</li>
    <li> This is my first product review.  I have been using product about 6 months now.  I&#x27;m on my 2nd jar.  It does not work on my melasma!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a change</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like giving poor reviews but unfortunately I can&#x27;t rate this product well. I used it twice a day for 6 weeks and not only did it not lighten whatsoever, but my brown spots look much darker when using this, and it doesn&#x27;t provide sufficient moisturizer to apply foundation over.</li>
    <li> I am really just getting started This is my second jar and it seems to be lightening my places on my hands. I know there is no magical thing to remove old dark spots. I use it twice a day. I like that it is all natural</li>
    <li> Has definitely lightened by brown spots - I will buy this product again.  Works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
    <li> -i bought this cream because at 45 years and too many careless years in the sun, my face was starting to look pretty brown and spotted in places- my skin is very dry and i have to be careful which lines i use- i bought this at whole foods because i like how everything is natural there- well i can tell you that after using this product twice a day for only 8 days, my face LOOKS AMAZING!!!- it&#x27;s brighter, the spots are fading and my complexion is so even-toned and younger looking- i CANNOT believe how this little cream did that, but i am SOOOOO HAPPY!- i am going to check out the rest of their line now because i think i could save myself a lot of money- i was going to spend $750 on 3 IPL treatments which i was told i would need (laser resurfacing to get rid of the brown spots and even out my skin) but i had been holding off obviously because of the insane cost- well, i don&#x27;t think i have go down that route now that i have discovered this product!!- and by the way, it leaves my skin feeling really good- it absorbs quickly, has no greasy residue, gives a good matte base for my make-up, makes me feel good knowing that i am putting all natural ingredients into my body and does not sting my face which is a miracle trust me!!- anyhow, thank-you to this company for making an all-natural product that is so effective- VERY HAPPY CUSTOMER HERE!!!</li>
    <li> Did Not See Any Results, But Then Again Only Used It For Two Weeks !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Just dabbing this product on my age spots twice a day, I noticed the lightening within a few weeks.  They haven&#x27;t completely diappeared, but they look faded and much better now.</li>
    <li> Bought this product beginning of July, due to hyperpigmentation on my upper lip. I used a hair depository and it tanned my skin a darker shade. I used this product 2X a day as directed. I have noticed no difference. It wasn&#x27;t the cheapest. I keep using it in hopes that it will work, maybe it takes awhile.</li>
    <li> This product is okay but I found that it doesn&#x27;t really get rid of the spots completely. After using for two months  I found it lightened the spots a little bit.</li>
    <li> just started using it, have to wait for results to show.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this great product before and have found it effective and non-irritating.</li>
    <li> I cant really say how I feel about it yet cause I haven&#x27;t used it yet. I got some other products and my skin is in the process of clearing up really well and once its done clearing I plan on using this to even my skin tone and I will write another review</li>
    <li> Let me first say that I purchased this primarily for the texture and the way my skin felt after using it, not for skin lightening. I tried the tester at Natural Grocers, I am very picky when it comes to facial moisturizer. It has to feel a certain way on my skin (not even remotely greasy), but supple, and has to not break me out. This fits the bill completely. I have tried hundreds of products for my face and I think I may have found &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;.  I have noticed my tone is more even after 3 days and it helps dry up active blemishes. Very pleased with this product, I think I may have found my perfect moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. This is my first time try this cream. I like it...will buy again</li>
    <li> With daily use this product lightens freckles on my hands</li>
    <li> After one month trial, I don&#x27;t see any improvement on my skin.  Since it&#x27;s made by natural herb, I&#x27;m pretty sure that it takes long time to get good result anyway.  I was hoping that I can see a little bit better result though.  I purchased more than one to get free shipping, I just have to use it continuously...</li>
    <li> I have never been disappointed with a derma e product. I waited to post a review until I had used this product for 4 weeks. My skin has never looked better and the few dark spots that I had are all but gone!</li>
    <li> noticed only a very slight change</li>
    <li> I noticed no changes.</li>
    <li> Not effective at all just give an instant boost in tone bt no long term effects seen</li>
    <li> I bought this item a few weeks ago.  I waited to write a review because I wanted to see if this skin lighter really worked, I&#x27;ve tried so many.  I must admit I am totally pleased.  It is amazing!  I use it twice a day on my whole face and neck.  I only wished I took a picture of before and after.  There was one pretty good size age spot on my left side of my face.  It is funny because I had to think a minute to remember which side it was on.  I use to hate to have my picture taken because of this spot.  I used photo shop to remove the spot from the picture.  No more!  Please when you purchase derma e&#x27; skin lightener don&#x27;t give up...give it time to do it&#x27;s job.  If you do you will be a believer!</li>
    <li> Product was as described, but you need to be patient and apply nightly for results--it truly takes about 3 weeks. I will have toi admit that there is another product that I started using that I feel is a little stronger. Very good if you have minimial skin darkening .</li>
