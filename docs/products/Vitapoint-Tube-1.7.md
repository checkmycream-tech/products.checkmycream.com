      <li>so i&#x27;am glad amazon had it.</li>
      <li>i love it for the hair, it gives it shine</li>
      <li>Nothing better</li>
      <li>have used this product all my life and glad to know where I can buy going forward.</li>
      <li>Hair is so much better, no frizzies, lookiung shiny and sleak.</li>
      <li>used this product for many years saved money compared to okc purchase.</li>
      <li>Original Clairol Vitapointe does not exist anymore!</li>
      <li>the original came in a jar and was much better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Original Clairol Vitapointe gave your hair a healthy look and bright alive shine without any feeling of having anything on it.</li>
      <li>Absolutely the best product for dry, unruly, curly hair.</li>
      <li>That said however it still works for my hair leaving it shiny and soft and smelling nice.  </li>
      <li>Glad to find Vitapointe in this new container.</li>
      <li>so you are not getting much as before for your money.</li>
      <li>No one seems smart enough to restore the original recipe....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s close enough to the original formula</li>
      <li>This tube seems different from the original formula.  </li>
      <li>In fact - shortly after application it evaporated leaving only a healthy shine.</li>
      <li>Current manufacturer, Hellen of Troy, changed slightly the original recipe.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still the only thing on the market that gives your hair a natural shine..</li>
      <li>Too bad it&#x27;s no longer available !!!</li>
      <li>It is not as long lasting as the old tube, on the hair.  </li>
