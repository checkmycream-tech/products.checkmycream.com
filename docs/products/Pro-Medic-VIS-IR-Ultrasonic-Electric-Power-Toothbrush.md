      <li>This toothbrush is the best I have found at removing stains from teeth and generally making my mouth feel cleaner.</li>

      <li>I absolutely love this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>My gums are stimulated and tingle (in a good way, not irritating).  </li>
      <li>so it is very worth it.</li>
      <li>I love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>It leaves my teeth feeling extremely clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>I emailed the company and they responded quickly</li>
      <li>I was a loyal Sonic fan and when it died, I tried the Pro-Medic.  </li>
      <li>Wow, how genius people are to  evolve  technology further and further  (Good to Great).</li>
      <li>but this was so worth</li>
      <li>If the brush gets too old, it comes with two more</li>
      <li>I had bleeding gums so someone recommended this toothbrush to me and it was worth it.</li>
      <li>This brush is definitely worth the price.  </li>
      <li>She said that not only the brush brightens her teeth but it also helps with breath and healthy gums and so on.  </li>
      <li>The first thing that made me suspicious of its quality was the product booklet that accompanied it.  </li>
      <li>I was sceptical at first but after just a couple weeks I started to see and feel a difference.  </li>
      <li>At first I respectfully said &amp;#34;thanks but no thanks&amp;#34;, but after my visit to my dentist and the normal dentist&#x27;s lectures, I&#x27;ve decided to invest big dollars on a toothbrush.</li>
      <li>Lastly, the bristles looked cheap and were losing their shape after 5 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>How can you really believe that the product technology is really a breakthrough?</li>
      <li>tend to have much sensitivity and stains from drinking coffee and tea.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Instructions don&#x27;t really make sense, doesn&#x27;t explain how any of the technology &amp;#34;works&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately I cannot bleach my teeth with chemicals because my teeth are really sensitive.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s powerful, yet gentle on your sensitive gum.  </li>
      <li>Hasn&#x27;t made any difference to my teeth, seems to make about the same difference as a good old regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Might be a while before the technology catches up with the theory.</li>
      <li>I ended up buying a new handle for my old sonicare brush and my teeth and gums are back to healthy within two weeks.</li>
      <li>My teeth have never felt so clean, and after several use, I could already see my teeth had gotten a shade whiter.</li>
      <li>I had to get one for my wife as well and when my 5-year old get little older, I will make her to use it. :)</li>
      <li>I am so trilled to tell people to try this new tech electric toothbrush for WHITENING while brushing your teeth.  </li>
      <li>I would like to recommend highly for people who have sensitive teeth and gums.</li>
      <li>I usually never write reviews</li>
      <li>Started out with the ridiculous Emmi-Dent and quickly traded up to the manly Pro-Medic with its ultrasonic and dual light - UV for whitening, infra-red for bacteria - vibrator quality, relatively quiet action.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m still left unsure on how the product really works or how you are suppose to brush with it?</li>
      <li>It far surpasses any products on the market.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Obviously it was written in Korean and then translated by someone who did not understand English very well.  </li>
      <li>I like the toothbrush - seems to be working so far.  </li>
      <li>I use it on high, but if you are sensitive, you can put it on low or not use it at all.  </li>
      <li>but my teeth feel very clean and appear as white as usual.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not cheap, especially for a toothbrush, I&#x27;m telling you, it&#x27;s very worth it.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find this Toothbrush to be anymore advanced then the spin brushes you can purchase for much cheaper, and purchasing new heads is expensive and can only be bought throu Amazon.</li>
      <li>Was little hesitant to purchase this toothbrush at first cos of its price but after using it for a couple of month, I cannot be happier.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Started out with the ridiculous Emmi-Dent and quickly traded up to the manly Pro-Medic with its ultrasonic and dual light - UV for whitening, infra-red for bacteria - vibrator quality, relatively quiet action. Love it, love it, love it. In my last dental checkup, the hygienist used the dreaded Cavitron 75% less than my previous visits. That&#x27;s reason alone to shell out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/9/14: My second bi-annual checkup was a disaster - five cavities (one of them serious). Lots of Cavitron and endless picking and scaling. My earlier report was based on a visit to a periodontist and his staff may not be as attuned to cavities and standard dental problems. So I&#x27;m now using the Sonicare as well as the Pro-Medica ultrasonic. My dentist claims that it&#x27;s not possible to provide ultrasound for less than $1000. Jury regrouping on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this thing Ultrasonic? The box it came in said Sonic. Back to using the Sonicare 1/3, Emmi-dent 1/3, and Pro-Medica 1/3. And five different toothpastes! s@%#s@%#s@%#!!!</li>
    <li> I like the toothbrush - seems to be working so far.  It has removed a lot of tartar and yellow stains around my gum-line.  I bought the product to help with receding gums but don&#x27;t know it it&#x27;s helped this issue yet? The problem I had was figuring out how to use it and what the lights do.  The insert does not include instructions on how to brush with it.  I emailed the company and they responded quickly but their response was still unclear and I&#x27;m still left unsure on how the product really works or how you are suppose to brush with it?</li>
    <li> Notwithstanding the fact that I may have just gotten a lemon, my experience with this brush was not positive.  The first thing that made me suspicious of its quality was the product booklet that accompanied it.  The book was the worst written product guide I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously it was written in Korean and then translated by someone who did not understand English very well.  Nonsense sentences and misspellings abounded.  It was hard to believe that the distributor did not arrange for the dozens of corrections to be made.  How can you have confidence in a company that is so sloppy about their work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it would not hold a charge.  All I could get was one brushing from it and then back to the charger.  Lastly, the bristles looked cheap and were losing their shape after 5 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never seen a company put out a booklet and packaging (there are grammar and syntax errors on the packaging as well) of such poor quality.  How can you really believe that the product technology is really a breakthrough?</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is the best I have found at removing stains from teeth and generally making my mouth feel cleaner. There was a noticeable difference in just a couple of days.</li>
    <li> I bought this power toothbrush with a doubt for I had a bleeding gums.  This product was recommended by my co-worker and  I have been using this brush for 2 months now, and it begins healing my gums.  It is not swelling or bleeding like it did before.</li>
    <li> It helps reducing plaque and tooth sensitivity and make my gum healthier.&lt;br /&gt;Simply, it is the best electric toothbrush out there.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find this Toothbrush to be anymore advanced then the spin brushes you can purchase for much cheaper, and purchasing new heads is expensive and can only be bought throu Amazon. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Everything I hoped for and more. This crushes the Phillips Sonicare in quality. Can&#x27;t imagine a better one on the market</li>
    <li> I hated this brush. I could never get the toothpaste to wash out of the brush head. I used it for 3 months to give it a fair chance anyway. My gums became irritated and teeth weren&#x27;t as white anymore. I ended up buying a new handle for my old sonicare brush and my teeth and gums are back to healthy within two weeks.</li>
    <li> Have had to delay a visit to dentist but my teeth feel very clean and appear as white as usual.</li>
    <li> Not that good. Instructions don&#x27;t really make sense, doesn&#x27;t explain how any of the technology &amp;#34;works&amp;#34;. Which I don&#x27;t think it does. Hasn&#x27;t made any difference to my teeth, seems to make about the same difference as a good old regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Might be a while before the technology catches up with the theory.</li>
    <li> I was sceptical at first but after just a couple weeks I started to see and feel a difference.  There are two vibration levels and you need very little toothpaste!  After one month I can see my teeth are a little brighter, my teeth sparkle and my gums feel healthier.</li>
    <li> A co-worker recommended me to give this a shot because she fell in love with the tooth brush.  I&#x27;ve noticed one day her teeth looked brighter and whiter over a morning break chat over our usual cup of coffee.  She said that not only the brush brightens her teeth but it also helps with breath and healthy gums and so on.  At first I respectfully said &amp;#34;thanks but no thanks&amp;#34;, but after my visit to my dentist and the normal dentist&#x27;s lectures, I&#x27;ve decided to invest big dollars on a toothbrush. Yes! It works! It paid off.  I&#x27;m so satisfied with the experience and the purchase, I wanted to take my time and effort to write this long review.  It&#x27;s not cheap, especially for a toothbrush, I&#x27;m telling you, it&#x27;s very worth it.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a month or so, I&#x27;m noticing a cleaner feel in my mouth in the morning, some already noticed whiter teeth(I&#x27;m taking daily photos, so that I can see for myself a before and after), less bleeding in gum lines, and so forth.  I had to get one for my wife as well and when my 5-year old get little older, I will make her to use it. :)</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever used, and I will never use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to have much sensitivity and stains from drinking coffee and tea.&lt;br /&gt;This amazing brush took away all my stains and whitened my teeth without bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I cannot bleach my teeth with chemicals because my teeth are really sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;Pro-Medic amazingly decreased my sensitivity in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Who ever invented this brush is shear genuis!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush. My teeth have never felt so clean, and after several use, I could already see my teeth had gotten a shade whiter. THis is a must have!</li>
    <li> I would like to recommend highly for people who have sensitive teeth and gums. I had a gum bleeding problem but it is gone since I used this Pro-Medic toothbrush.  It works so well.  [[ASIN:B009CE7CAG Pro-Medic VIS-IR Ultrasonic Electric Power Toothbrush]]</li>
    <li> I use to use the Oral B and Sonicare toothbrushes for years and years and I loved them. I would never go back from an electric to a regular toothbrush. I thought that those products were the best products invented until I found LEDs Ultrasonic Pro-medic toothbrush 2 months ago. Why didn&#x27;t I know until now!! Wow, how genius people are to  evolve  technology further and further  (Good to Great). I am so trilled to tell people to try this new tech electric toothbrush for WHITENING while brushing your teeth.  No need to buy any additional oral care product. This one product does it all from whitening to  reduction in gum bleeding and gingivitis, and is antibacterial.  I&#x27;ve noticed  cleaner, fleshier,  whiter and healthier teeth and gums. My friends have also commented on my  whiter teeth. I gave a Pro-medic to one of my friends. She loves it and tells everyone how great it is. It far surpasses any products on the market. MUST-BUY toothbrush!!!</li>
    <li> I was a loyal Sonic fan and when it died, I tried the Pro-Medic.  It is great!  A totally different experience.  When you are done, you feel the effects.  My gums are stimulated and tingle (in a good way, not irritating).  I use it with a whitening toothpaste and it accelerates the whitening process.  I can tell that it is tackling the bacteria.  My gums feel healthy and it makes my mouth fresher (kills any bacteria and aids in killing bad breath). I love it and I won&#x27;t be using any others.  There are two lights that are in the brush that work on your teeth and gums that work on the whitening, plaque and bacteria.  It is sort of a \\&quot;Star Wars\\&quot; kind of toothbrush.  You can adjust the power of the effects of the lights (the brightening and gum stimulation and bacteria scrubbing).  I use it on high, but if you are sensitive, you can put it on low or not use it at all.  It still operates as a Sonic type experience without the lights, except the curve of the brush is much more intelligent.  It conforms to the shape of your teeth.  I love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I just bought this toothbrush and it helps a lot for my teeth. I had bleeding gums so someone recommended this toothbrush to me and it was worth it. This toothbrush is too good for the price they have listed. Not only does it help my gums, it also whitens my teeth and gets through between each one cleaning the inside and out. I usually never write reviews but this was so worth it I wanted you to know about it. If the brush gets too old, it comes with two more so it is very worth it. Trust me, it helps.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;I had couple of Pro-Medic toothbrushes. They make great toothbrush. Ever since I used their product, I cannot go back to other regular toothbrushes. It&#x27;s amazing! My teeth feel cleaner and whiter everyday. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> This brush is definitely worth the price.  It&#x27;s powerful, yet gentle on your sensitive gum.  Was little hesitant to purchase this toothbrush at first cos of its price but after using it for a couple of month, I cannot be happier.  It leaves my teeth feeling extremely clean and fresh.  Most of all, the two light-emitting diodes are amazing in reducing plaques and whitening teeth.  My teeth are actually one-shade whiter.</li>
