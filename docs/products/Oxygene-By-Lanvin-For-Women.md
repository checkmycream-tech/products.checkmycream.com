<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> thans so much I love this cologne</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving five stars due to the Good quality of this product. Is not the first (or the last) time I buy it for my wife.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this subtle and sophisticated scent for years. Even better now that it is discontinued and I can get it at Amazon for a third of the original price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for over 15 years and every time I try a new one I got back to it....very clean and musty smell...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance for years because I really dislike 1. going to department stores and 2. smelling like bad perfume in a search for the right one(s).  I happened upon it somehow and love it.  It&#x27;s light and airy with a hint of sweetness without being overpoweringly floral.  I have a super-sensitive nose so I don&#x27;t wear much.  I really enjoyed reading the reviews written by people who really know and love fragrance.  I&#x27;d love to find other fragrances that do as well on me as Oxygene does.</li>
    <li> A decade ago a friend and I went through the perfume department and tried this perfume. I cannot tolerate majority of fragrances, they give me headaches. 45 miles out of the city we turned around to purchase, it got BETTER with time on. It then was not carried in department stores and we ran out. SO GLAD WE FOUND IT AGAIN AND CHEAPER!!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells great and earns me tons of compliments!!!!  I couldn&#x27;t resist picking up some more for the fantastic price!</li>
    <li> Been wearing for years and even a few of my friends made the switch...Light- not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for years and get many compliments on it. Not overpowering, fresh scent.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful scent. Very soft.  I get many compliments.  So will you!</li>
    <li> Great product, great service&lt;br /&gt;Always loved the fragrance, but in recent years it has become difficult to find in the store. Amazon had it!</li>
    <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very satsified with the purchase. Light, non-imposing perfume, just what my wife likes.</li>
    <li> I received the Oxygene perfume in mint condition and it was exactly what I wanted!!</li>
    <li> the smell is nice:watery/ozone scent with light floral traces. Lanvin&#x27;s oxygene is similar to cool water and cabotine blue but is less sweet and more watery. It is appropriate for casual wear but it doesn&#x27;t have a good lasting power on me. For the price offered on amazon for less than 20 bucks, it think it is a good deal.</li>
    <li> Very clean smell that lasts for a long time</li>
    <li> Everythin all right. On time perfect conditions.</li>
    <li> Seeing this wonderful fresh scent for so little money I had to get it. I already owned this light airy perfume before so I knew what I was buying.&lt;br /&gt;This scent is not offensive (imho) at all. Like I said before it is a fresh and light perfume. It has a creaminess about it, a very fresh spiciness (yet not hatchoo spicy). I find it perfect for during the day, summer, spring, fall or winter it is a good day perfume that will stick with you for the entire day (esp when sprayed on clothes).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s weird how this perfume is both like a warm and comfy as well as fresh, light and airy.</li>
    <li> Oxygene opens with pepper but basically it&#x27;s all floral on me. It&#x27;s relatively strong &amp; long-lasting. Sandalwood and musk are very me, so I never really noticed them. I adore bergamot, which is likely one of the reasons that I liked this so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oxygene is not aquatic, not in the least. When I think aquatic, I think of strong aquatics like Cool Water &amp; Nautica Bermuda Blue or weak aquatics like Omnia Crystalline &amp; Sung Shi. Oxygene is neither a strong nor weak aquatic. I don&#x27;t get the blue reference, I just don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oxygene got me hooked on Alberto Morillas &amp; on building a fragrance wardrobe. I found it online for a great price and bought it blind. Wore it in summers for three years but this year I found the gardenia to be too overpowering for my taste. Not sure if that is because the juice changed or my taste changed or my chemistry changed ... maybe a bit of all. I gifted the remainder I disliked the domineering gardenia so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, Oxygene is a great value perfume &amp; a must-try for any fragrance lover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: 4 out of 5.</li>
    <li> This has been discontinued in the major department stores so I was happy to find it at Amazon and will order it online as long as they can supply it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this parfum because it is really cheap. I received it 4 days after ordering, delivered very fast. The flavor is very nice, make me feel comfortable.</li>
    <li> This is a very hard perfume to find in the Dept Stores and when I have found it they wanted $75 or more for it. It was soo nice to find one of my favorite perfumes at such a great price. Plus, not to mention the compliments I get when I wear it. Oxygene has such a nice clean smell. When you first spray it it may seem a little overpowering and strong, but it quickly calms down. One spritz on my wrist and kneck last all day long. My husband and children says its their favorite!</li>
    <li> I was afraid to buy this one,but i gave a try,because it was good review on the webside.should always follow myself.it is just a cheap one,smells gross,not even want to use it for my bathroom.i like amazon,but felt really bad this time,i don&#x27;t believe the origenal price was $62,you get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> The order was received and processed with urgency and I recieved my order much quicker than expected. Keep up the great work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again!!</li>
    <li> I would like to just say that I never received this item and I am not happy b/c I was expeting this item before Christmas for a gift. According to the delivery date I was suppose to receive this item on the 23 of December but never did. Now here we are in 2012 and still have not received my purchased item....I am very disappointed with this seller. As a result I will not be purchasing anything from this seller in the future. I hope I will be reimbursed all my money back b/c it&#x27;s not fair that I was charged for something that I never got, I would like to find out how I can go about to get in contact with this seller? So please be very careful!!</li>
    <li> I adore oxygene by lanvin. this is usually a very difficult parfum to find. It has been around for a while, sort of an undercover secret scent,but those that smell it know its something special. Light and very airy..smells clean but not soapy, a whiff of fresh breezy air. its not overpowering,non floral..difficult to describe..when you wear it you just smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fresh. great price too.</li>
    <li> I had searched and searched for this perfume for my wife, and finally found it on dear old amazon!! She was shocked when i brought it home, and began using it the next morning. I love the way it smell on her, and it lasts all day, without reapplying...</li>
    <li> my favorite perfume - i always get compliments all day long - even when I feel its worn off and cant smell it anymore i still get compliments.  I only apply once a day in the AM - hidden gem!</li>
    <li> Great fragance.... I love it for more than 10 years, I recomended to anybody who likes something sweet and fresh!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance that my wife uses. Oftentimes, I find myself asking &#x27;What is that frangrance your wearing?&#x27; and she answers this one. She wears a number of different ones and I really don&#x27;t notice the others like this one. It turns out to be her favorite one too. I bought 2 bottles last Christmas and now I want to suprise her with 2 more for Valentines Day.</li>
    <li> I love Oxygene by Lanvin for Women. It&#x27;s one of my favorite colognes EVER! It&#x27;s normally pretty expensive, but I spent $24 on this and it&#x27;s the exact same. They even sent me a mouse pad with my order. I love this mouse pad. I know, it&#x27;s just a mouse pad, but I actually needed one and this one is really cute.</li>
    <li> I like this soft scent for wearing to work and it is hard to find..... Thanks!!</li>
    <li> For this price it was a nice cold smell! You won&#x27;t experience one of those cheap perfumes that smell changes after you apply it. Though still you should not expect it to be a classy smell!</li>
    <li> This smells much as the fragrance Cool Water.  Like the latter, it has a base tone of florals, with an overtone of cucumber or melon and is very fresh and light. Oxygene is possibly slightly sharper than the Cool Water, though without having both, you would not know that.  In both cases, I felt that they were more appropraite for an individual younger than I am, someone in their teens or 20&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Wife loves the perfume; I love the price</li>
    <li> Have used the same perfume for the past 16 years.  Still love it, but this particular scent is a refreshing change.  Thanks to my sister for the suggestion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nina in Colorado</li>
    <li> The scent is so soft. It smells like a spring breeze. The subtle fragrance lingers for the whole day.  I love this fragrance!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful fresh and slightly sweet scent. It&#x27;s subtle but layers well if you prefer a stronger fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume since 2005...still love it.  The scent is not too strong and heavy.  I do a light spray and I&#x27;m on my way.  Lasts all day.  I always get compliments.</li>
    <li> Was very happy to find this perfume. I have not seen it in stores for years. Thank You!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume and is hard to find.  So glad that to be able to purchase.</li>
    <li> This is actually my signature scent...I love it, I lovet I love it... it&#x27;s a special scentiment when I wear it. Very suitable for any season; in summer smells fresh... In winter smells warm... I love it!!! (sorry for the redundance) Hard to describe the notes,  but definitely not for a flowery or fruity person.  This is Ozonic, and let me tell you... The dry down is inexplicable, amazing, totally different than the typical musky ones. 4 ever Lanvin!</li>
    <li> Light, pleasing fragrance. I get many compliments on it. Not overwhelming, but lasts all day. Have given as gifts. The price thru Amazon is best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and have been wearing it for years. I always get compliments on how much people love the smell of my perfume. Very difficult product to find in stores though so great that&#x27;s it was easy to find on amazon and delivered fast and right to my front door!</li>
    <li> I bought this because while I love Eclat d&#x27;Arpege, it&#x27;s so soft and it doesn&#x27;t last at all, and I was hoping to find something similar but more substantial.  It just arrived, and based on my so-far 5 minutes experience, I love it.  It feels light but luxe.  I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a fresh, clean scent that reminded me of Escada&#x27;s Feeling Free from the &#x27;90&#x27;s.  The spray is nice on the bottle.  Also, the perfume itself is powerful.  I thought it might be &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;weaker&amp;#34;... not at all.  Full quality at a discount price. I was very happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this for many years and it&#x27;s perfect for my body chemistry. I get compliments EVERY time I wear it still to this day!!</li>
    <li> Yummy!  Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This cologne is amazing.  I am not a fruity or flowery scent girl and this cologne fit my bill!  It came very well packaged even if it was late.</li>
    <li> As with other parfums marked as prime, Amazon does not deliver when promise. Expect 5 days instead of 2 if you are using Prime. Amazon does not inform that this is considered hazardous product and therefore it is subjected to other type of rules of mailing. Fine by me, but I want to be informed first, not get my parfum 3 days after I needed it. Parfum 5*. Amazon 1*. There are other websites that give equal or better prices and deliver when they say they would.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is so lovely. Hands down awesome perfum....a must have in collection</li>
    <li> Its good but E&#x27;clat D&#x27;arpege by same  Lanvin maker received more compliments</li>
    <li> I first used this scent in 2005 and 9 years later I am still in love. Will definitely buy 3 bottles at time from now on since this is my go to every day scent that everyone loves on me!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used oxygene for years, but cannot get in the stores any more.  I  buy from various retailers on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve have numerous compliments from people in stores or wherever I am about how good it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it as long as I can find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great!</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> One of my moms favorite perfumes! It was a birthday gift!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing a Oxygene since shortly after Lanvin released it, and I&#x27;ve found myself stocking up lately, just to be sure that I have a lifetime supply in case Lanvin ever takes it away from me! It is a beautiful, subtle, long lasting, and versatile scent that you can wear during the day, yet is still romantic enough for evening. I&#x27;ve been stopped on more than one occasion and asked what I&#x27;m wearing! Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not easy to find— even the ladies at the Lanvin counter at Neimans sent me to Amazon! While there are a zillion other fragrances out there, this one has become a part of me. It&#x27;s definitely a well kept secret.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed this fragrance myself but perhaps I applied a bit too much by accident. It has been the only fragrance I&#x27;ve received multiple complaints about at the office, people literally running away, saying \\&quot;I&#x27;m allergic!\\&quot; very embarassing, as you might guess.Beware, it is loud, but that could be good, as a small bottle should be a 10 year supply.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been looking for these perfume everywhere, and finally i found them, they are the best, love the smell, the smell could stays for weeks on clothes... i&#x27;m just happy htat i bought them...</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent, my 2nd bottle</li>
    <li> smells like fresh from the shower. Not overpowering and feels like fresh spring air.</li>
    <li> can not find this in any store and is what my daughter in law uses she was thrilled I found it Hopefully you will keep this in your market</li>
    <li> My wife likes it, so it is certainly the greatest! Really don&#x27;t know why I need more to comment on.</li>
    <li> Love it! This if my favorite perfume of all time! It has a very rich, fresh scent. My husband loves this perfume too because it&#x27;s not too strong or flowery, just smells great.</li>
    <li> This is my most favorite and most stores don&#x27;t carry it.I can always count on Amazon to find what I am looking for.The fragrance is sweet and mild but pleasing to the nostrils</li>
    <li> There have been many perfumes that I have liked over the years: Cristalle, Sung, Carolina Herrera. And there have been many that I have despised: Vanilla Secrets, Atomic Apple, Aramis, Anything with patchouli.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I met this alluring young woman with divine scent, I had to ask her what she was wearing. \\&quot;Oxygene.\\&quot; When I saw it was not expensive I realized that here is a quality perfume that is inexpensive without being cheap.  My kind of perfume.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance.  Not too strong and smells really good at such a decent price.  Everytime I wear it I get compliments</li>
    <li> This is a suttle fragrance, not too strong on my sinuses. It lasts longer on the skin and it can be worn both in winter and summer. My female friends are raving about it so I guess I can&#x27;t complain...</li>
    <li> Package came in the mail in a week and packaged well. The quality of the perfume is very vibrant. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN WEARING THIS FRAGRANCE FOR YEARS AND I STILL GET GREAT COMPLIMENTS ABOUT HOW GOOD I SMELL. I DON&#x27;T WANT TO SAY TO MUCH THIEN MANY OTHERS WILL PURCHASE IT AND I WON&#x27;T BE ABLE TO FIND IT.</li>
    <li> First I have to apologize to my seller for not leaving feedback. I have a memory problem due to brain surgery &amp; I forgot. I am truly sorry &amp; it won&#x27;t happen again. I give 5 stars though. I have used this perfume since 2001 &amp; never got as many compliments with any other perfume. I was so disappointed when they stopped selling it in the stores, but I guess it has turned out great since I can get it so much cheaper online. This is simply the best smelling perfume I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume!!!! Glad I was able to find it again. :) Great scent with a good price. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Wife loves this perfume.</li>
    <li> this fragrance took me back to when it first came out and I still love it. its unique and smells awesome</li>
    <li> Got this for my birthday 1 year from a friend. Ran out !&lt;br /&gt;Tracked it down on here &amp; bought it again.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like baby powder in a&lt;br /&gt; liquid form.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always getting compliments because of its fresh scent as I pass people.&lt;br /&gt;Good buy !</li>
    <li> Excellent product , Oxygene By Lanvin For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 2.5 Ounces&lt;br /&gt;Lanvin, smells so good ! And excellent service. Deliver in time in great condition.</li>
    <li> This is a very lovely fragrance. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to this one. The smell is too strong. It is different from the one I bought in store.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume! I buy it all the time and every time i wear it, I get a ton of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Soontobe...</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised</li>
    <li> I LOVE these shoes! They are gorgeous &amp; very well made. Very happy with the price as well. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I could not find this perfume in the stores. When I found it online I was so happy.  But the problem is that I waited and waited and didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d get it before Christmas. It was suppose to be here on 12/14/12 but I waited and I waited. I finally had to send a msg saying wheres my stuff. It&#x27;s like they forgot the 1st time.</li>
    <li> I ran across this perfume quite a few years ago in a department store. It was always so expensive, but every single time I wear it, I get a compliment. And not just from men. Women love this scent, too. It&#x27;s subtle but very seductive and sexy. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it out of the box and spray some on me. I&#x27;ve been out for 2 years. Now that I&#x27;ve found it here on Amazon, I can actually afford to wear it again.</li>
    <li> When I wear this musky floral scent, people cant help but tell me how good I smell. It is a one of a kind scent that lingers long after the initial application. I like to spray it into my hair to add a little something special instead of just on the pulse points. When you wear this fragrance, you will receive compliments all day long and into the night</li>
    <li> I really like this fragrance.  The scent is elegant and sexy.  I bought Oxygene two years ago, and I had more women asking me what was I wearing than my Calvin Klein for women</li>
    <li> Better price than the flea markets!</li>
    <li> I was usuing Eclat by Lanvin for a while, always got tons of compliments and gave it as gifts to many of my friends who call this smell magic and attractive. I went through 2 bottles in one year considering I own about 10 different parfumes! I decided to search online reviews on other Lanvin parfumes from people who like Eclat and found this perfume mentioned by lots of women. I ordered it without smelling it first (since they don&#x27;t sell it in stores). I was pleasantly surprised to like it as much as Eclat, even better for now since I got kinda of tired of Eclat for now. So if you like fresh, woody, not annoying sweet smell go for it, especially for this low price - you wouldn&#x27;t regret. And yes, I get lots of compiments on this parfume now too :)</li>
    <li> A few years ago I recieved this sent as a gift.  I was complimented constantly, You Smell Great!, Not Too overwhelming!\\&quot; and the best compliment of all from my husband...You smell so good, did I give you that!\\&quot;  It&#x27;s the perfect scent for an office job.  I love it and you can&#x27;t beat the Amazon price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and never have had  a problem. Very satisfied with the product,  I do recommend this product to others!</li>
