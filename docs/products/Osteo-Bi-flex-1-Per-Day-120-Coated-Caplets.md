      <li>These work great, one a day is a nice factor -</li>
      <li>good product and stated as it was listed on Amazon.</li>
      <li>this product is good.</li>
      <li>I have found Osteo Bi-Flex to be the best brand of treatment for mild arthritis for me.  </li>
      <li>&amp; best regards from Egypt ;)</li>
      <li>this product really helps the knee joints from aching and this is the best price I have found</li>
      <li>Good product with easy dosing.</li>
      <li>I think that is going to be fine!</li>
      <li>Quick delivery, good price.</li>
      <li>Great product, large pill</li>
      <li>makes my knees feel much better</li>
      <li>I have recommended this to so many people.</li>
      <li>I have used it for more then 2 years and my jointts has been much better then before.</li>
      <li>It is perfect, because only one capsule per day!</li>
      <li>I have been buying osteo bi flex for my mom for many years.</li>
      <li>Just ordered more.  </li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>course, I know that to be compleatly OK</li>
      <li>I tried prescription pain relievers and found that Osteo Bi-Flex worked better.</li>
      <li>It caused me to not be able to sleep well.</li>
      <li>am feeling ok.</li>
      <li>I am sure that this product is good for people needing the level of supplement that it contains, and taking 1 per day is a bonus in itself, but the 4 per day joint formula provides 99% relief for my particular injury.  </li>
      <li>I take this every day and it is a huge help.</li>
      <li>Tablets are huge, I cannot swallow them&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
      <li>These pills are huge.</li>
      <li>most brands require two pills a day - and the price is right on Amazon - beats all the retailers, if you can even find it at a retailer.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it was making much of a difference</li>
      <li>2 or 3 weeks later, the relief was so good that I&#x27;m taking the time to recommend this to others.&lt;br</li>
      <li>She tried it and she&#x27;s amazed at how good this product made her feel, and how her knee doesnt hurt or annoys her whenever she walks.&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommended for people with blood pressure, all noted that it&#x27;s very mild on the stomach, apart from other glucozamine</li>
      <li>you will see results quickly.</li>
      <li>However, given the severity of my injury, I kept seeking a better supplement and found that the Osteo Bi-Flex 4 per day joint formula provides more proprietary blend of  ingredients necessary for my relief.  </li>
      <li>My pain level kept me true to my exercises - sometimes I would get up in the&lt;br /&gt;night and do them for relief and a chance that I would get some very much needed rest.  </li>
      <li>It would be nice to only have to take 1 per today, but the size of the pill would probably choke an elephant.</li>
      <li>Well worth it.</li>
      <li>It is a bit pricey, but well worth it.</li>
      <li>The drugstores often have a BOGO which looks like a better price, however, those are usually the kind of which you have to take 2 or 3 tablets.  </li>
      <li>if I take this consistently.  </li>
      <li>Love only needing to take 1!!!</li>
      <li>Trying for first time.</li>
      <li>I´m using this one for the first time</li>
      <li>And a friend of mine used it already and told that really worked well to her!</li>
      <li>It certainly helped me and I would recommend it to anyone suffering joint pain.</li>
      <li>Although the one pill a day is rather large.  </li>
      <li>I went through the Walmart bottle, then this large bottle from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>am wondering why the users of this product are not taking the chondroiton/glucosamine product and why they would take the product containing only glucosamine?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, per other reviews, these pills are too large to be safely swallowed and could easily lodge in the throat.</li>
      <li>I did not use these much because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It really works -</li>
      <li>takes the arthritis pain out of my knees, highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Started taking them and didn&#x27;t really think much about it as I have tried Gluc/Cond products before with no noticeable difference.  </li>
      <li>These have helped me so much.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t function very well without it.</li>
      <li>I just slip it in a piece of ham and he practically swallows it whole....</li>
      <li>It is so much cheaper when you buy it in four month supplies like this one.  </li>
      <li>So I really don&#x27;t know.  </li>
      <li>It is easy on my system and eliminates the daily pains from osteo arthritis from my hands, in particular.</li>
      <li>Have tried many other brands, but this one really works.</li>
      <li>Once a day is great but the pills themselves are big making them hard to swallow.</li>
      <li>I feel more knee stability and less joint pain since using the product.</li>
      <li>It works very well as far as relief from joint issues</li>
      <li>He was to the point where he would limp every time he got up from not moving for more than a couple minutes.</li>
      <li>It is definitely a product that is well worth the price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 59&#x27;s and live in Brazil.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t l live with out it.</li>
      <li>when she stops taking them the pain comes back in a few months but as long as she has them she drives, walks and moves much more comfortably</li>
      <li>(Even if this is a placebo, the net result is positive.)  </li>
      <li>Now he&#x27;s up and chasing my year-and-a-half old dog around the yard again.</li>
      <li>I actually bought this for my arthritic dog, and it has helped him SO much.</li>
      <li>Ask your health Professional if you take prescription medication.</li>
      <li>Nothing so far works for me.</li>
      <li>It is by far the chunkiest pill I have ever seen.</li>
      <li>Good price for a questionable product</li>
      <li>no effect after regular dosage for about thirty days, no easing of knee or other joint discomfort, but no bad side effects either</li>
      <li>Due to sedentary life (too much work and too much time driving to work and back home...)</li>
      <li>These are not capsules, but huge tablets, hard to swallow - and</li>
      <li>However, one of the major problems I had was the amount of pills that were required daily.</li>
      <li>The tablets are a little large and I have found taking them with a drink of milk helps.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Trying for first time.</li>
    <li> Good price for a questionable product</li>
    <li> I saw the increased joint comfort within 7 days and picked up a bottle at Walmart.  Started taking them and didn&#x27;t really think much about it as I have tried Gluc/Cond products before with no noticeable difference.  All of a sudden on day 5 I got out of my chair, started to reach down and rub my knees from the pain and was shocked when I realized I didn&#x27;t need to.  This stuff really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is you have to keep taking it.  I went through the Walmart bottle, then this large bottle from Amazon.  Ran out and haven&#x27;t had any for 4 days and the stiffness is returning.  Just ordered more.  Well worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for years and it works for me, I bougth it for the rest of the family</li>
    <li> Although the one pill a day is rather large.  Nevertheless, I like having less pills to take. I think this product helps my aging joints and associated pain.</li>
    <li> This helps my husbands knee pain and is in line/cheaper than store prices.</li>
    <li> Love this. And price is great. Can&#x27;t find 120 tab in stores.</li>
    <li> This one is for once a day ...I like that</li>
    <li> Good prices - have been using this product for some time</li>
    <li> 1.  Cheaper than in a supermarket  2. One pill a day!  The pill are a bit big, but I only need one a day.</li>
    <li> I could not see the size of the pill inside the opaque bottle, so bought them anyway and brought them home.  Opened the bottle, and promptly threw it in the trash.  What a waste of money!  The pill dimensions are:  3/8&amp;#34; in height by 1&amp;#34; in length.  I could never swallow that!  It is by far the chunkiest pill I have ever seen.</li>
    <li> Great product, large pill</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for my arthritic dog, and it has helped him SO much. This pill is basically just glucosamine and cellulose, so it won&#x27;t hurt anything (there are animal versions of this out there as well, this was just cheaper and works basically the same way). I just slip it in a piece of ham and he practically swallows it whole.... He was to the point where he would limp every time he got up from not moving for more than a couple minutes. Now he&#x27;s up and chasing my year-and-a-half old dog around the yard again. My dad says he took this for a period of time as well and that it helped, so it&#x27;s good for it&#x27;s intended purpose too lol</li>
    <li> It works very well as far as relief from joint issues but it&#x27;s sooo hard to swallow.  I even cut it in half hoping that would make it easier but it&#x27;s so large around that it&#x27;s still hard to swallow.  I will finish this bottle but I will not ever buy the one-a-day again.  I&#x27;ll take the 2-a-day anytime instead of this &amp;#34;horse pill&amp;#34;.  ha.</li>
    <li> While there has been some information suggesting that these pills do not help joint pain, my husband thinks they help.  (Even if this is a placebo, the net result is positive.)  And Amazon has an amazing price!</li>
    <li> This is the only product that seems to work for me. It is a bit pricey, but well worth it. I like having to take it only once a day. The tablets are a little large and I have found taking them with a drink of milk helps.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very simple..they work!! I have recommended this to so many people. it an instant upgrade to joint comfort. you will see results quickly. Great product!</li>
    <li> Once a day is great but the pills themselves are big making them hard to swallow. I reccomend that they be taken solo without any other medication.</li>
    <li> I have been buying osteo bi flex for my mom for many years. it works like a miracle. she used to have pains on her knees and they are gone. when she stops taking them the pain comes back in a few months but as long as she has them she drives, walks and moves much more comfortably</li>
    <li> these pills are great. They help me a great deal with my joint pains. Makes a big difference and it&#x27;s convenient since you only need one a day.</li>
    <li> I tried prescription pain relievers and found that Osteo Bi-Flex worked better. The price was affordable and it works! I&#x27;ll continue to buy this product here.</li>
    <li> I was having a terrible time with pain in my hip. It caused me to not be able to sleep well. My daughter told me about Osteo Bi-flex so I gave it a try. Before a week was up the pain had diminished. It certainly helped me and I would recommend it to anyone suffering joint pain.</li>
    <li> I have been taking Osteo Bi-Flex for a long time I like these because you only have to take one a day as opposed to two a day</li>
    <li> My husband uses this because it is only one a day pill.  He has arthritis in both knees and notices a difference when he goes off this medicine.  Out of all the Gloucosamin/Chondroitin OTC&#x27;s out there, this works the best in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Wherever you shop OsteoBiFlex is expensive.  This seems to be the best price for a physician recommended product.</li>
    <li> I had used this product before with good results, I tried it again but was disappointed.  Maybe my health is the causative factor for lack of results.  Others I know would not start the day without it.</li>
    <li> this product really helps the knee joints from aching and this is the best price I have found</li>
    <li> my husband takes this daily and the one a day is the way to go!!&lt;br /&gt;the price is less than even sams where you still have to take two or three pills!</li>
    <li> this product is good. I have used it for more then 2 years and my jointts has been much better then before.</li>
    <li> good product. helps my arthritis...etc.</li>
    <li> These have helped me so much. I would advise these for everyone!!!!!</li>
    <li> takes the arthritis pain out of my knees, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Worked for a short time for my Osteoarthritis in my hips and legs. Did not take much of my back pain away. This product can interact with some medications. Ask your health Professional if you take prescription medication.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for some years.&lt;br /&gt;I am feeling ok.</li>
    <li> This has been a helpful addition to my vitamins after I had my hip resurfaced. I wasn&#x27;t sure it was making much of a difference so I went off it for a few weeks and that was a big mistake! It is definitely a product that is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I did not use these much because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Tablets are huge, I cannot swallow them&lt;br /&gt;2) Tried breaking them in two, but was hurting my throat.</li>
    <li> I take this every day and it is a huge help. I workout almost every day and this helps with my joints since I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Muy buen producto no hay problemas con el vendedor lo recomiendo fue muy rapido y eficiente en el despacho a mi pais</li>
    <li> Good product with easy dosing.</li>
    <li> Great once a day miracle tablets.</li>
    <li> I feel more knee stability and less joint pain since using the product. I&#x27;ll be 65 in 08/14.&lt;br /&gt;I played softball for over 15 years, many as catcher, ending in my early 40&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;The last few years walking 18 holes of golf became very painful. I bought the product&lt;br /&gt;in Dec. 2013 and can&#x27;t wait to see if I can still get the walking exercise I want from an 18 hole walk.&lt;br /&gt;Stay tuned.....</li>
    <li> On the same listing of products, Amazon pictures a product in a dark blue container that is described as containing chondroiton/glucosamine, 2 per day. Amazon then shows this box with the One Per Day labeling. However, the container in the box is identical to the dark blue container that is described as containing C&amp;G. The One Per Day product contains only glucosamine - and the same proprietary 5-Loxin ingredient as the C&amp;G  2 per day product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am wondering why the users of this product are not taking the chondroiton/glucosamine product and why they would take the product containing only glucosamine?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, per other reviews, these pills are too large to be safely swallowed and could easily lodge in the throat. I had it happen with one that I broke in half. These are coated pils to make them easier to swallow. By breaking the pill in half, rough, jagged edges result and the efficacy of the coated pill is negated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using a pill crusher and placing the semi-powder into half a glass of water with a teaspoon of sugar. The resulting solution was foul and does not solve the problem.</li>
    <li> It is perfect, because only one capsule per day! All the others ones you need to takes 2! Very good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been take Osteo Bi-Flex for long time because it works for me. It help recovering joints lubrication and help pain remain in lower level.</li>
    <li> My surgically repaired knee is going on 20 plus years now. I am feeling a clicking in my knee joint and some arthritic pain every once in a while. I was hoping this product would give me some relief but I haven&#x27;t noticed it yet and I&#x27;ve been taking the pills faithfully for 3 weeks. Looking into something stronger. I&#x27;m hoping to put off a knee replacement if possible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 59&#x27;s and live in Brazil. Due to sedentary life (too much work and too much time driving to work and back home...) I have had almost no time for excercises. So, as it should be, my knees were in pain on every effort different that just walking. After I started using Osteo bi-Flex, like 2 or 3 weeks later, the relief was so good that I&#x27;m taking the time to recommend this to others.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I know that to be compleatly OK I should do some excercises, but this was the very best way to start living better. Now it&#x27;s my call to improve...&lt;br /&gt;PS.: I receive it in Brazil from Amazon, at no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(PtBr: Tenho 59 anos e vivo no Brasil, nunca faço exercicios pois moro em SBC - SP e trabalho em Sto Amaro - Sao Paulo e além de trabalhar e dirigir, nao sobra tempo. Tinha muitas dores de joelho, de fazer qualquer esforço além de andar. Depois de 2 ou 3 semanas tomando Osteo Bi-Flex, minhas dores sumiram. Sei que tenho que fazer excercicios, mais este foi o melhor começo! PS.: Recebo normalmente de Amazon.)</li>
    <li> I tore my bicep tendon out of my shoulder and went to an Orthopedic surgeon for consultation.  As an alternative to surgery, I&lt;br /&gt;underwent PT and did rehab exercises for 3 years.  My pain level kept me true to my exercises - sometimes I would get up in the&lt;br /&gt;night and do them for relief and a chance that I would get some very much needed rest.  I tried numerous supplements, this being one of them, and did experience a tad bit of relief from this product.  However, given the severity of my injury, I kept seeking a better supplement and found that the Osteo Bi-Flex 4 per day joint formula provides more proprietary blend of  ingredients necessary for my relief.  I am sure that this product is good for people needing the level of supplement that it contains, and taking 1 per day is a bonus in itself, but the 4 per day joint formula provides 99% relief for my particular injury.  It would be nice to only have to take 1 per today, but the size of the pill would probably choke an elephant.</li>
    <li> good product and stated as it was listed on Amazon. I will always take this stuff due to my knee problems.</li>
    <li> ONLY THING THAT WORKS FOR ME</li>
    <li> My husband takes this all the time and thinks it is what keeps him going so he can continue to play golf.</li>
    <li> My Doctor has recommenced these. Have been taking them a month and I do feel a difference!</li>
    <li> All I can say,is that this stuff works,period! Couldn&#x27;t function very well without it.I work with my hands and this keeps me from waking in pain every day.</li>
    <li> These are not capsules, but huge tablets, hard to swallow - and I&#x27;ve taken this bottle, and am now on the stronger one. I honestly do not think they help me at all, and have a sneaking suspicion that they don&#x27;t even dissolve - so big and hard. They&#x27;ve been around awhile, and must help some people. Just not me.</li>
    <li> I like the price, I just take my 3rd pill so in this moment I can´t describe or evaluate the product</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t l live with out it. Have tried many other brands, but this one really works.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, good price.</li>
    <li> I am 68 and no more pain in my joints. It was prescribed by my doctor.</li>
    <li> I have taken glucosamine for my joints for years now and I do believe it has helped. However, one of the major problems I had was the amount of pills that were required daily. Love only needing to take 1!!! I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
    <li> makes my knees feel much better</li>
    <li> These work great, one a day is a nice factor - most brands require two pills a day - and the price is right on Amazon - beats all the retailers, if you can even find it at a retailer.</li>
    <li> These pills are huge. I have to break them up. However the product does diminish my pain.</li>
    <li> I have been limping and unable to walk for awhile.  Went to an Ortho doctor and he said I had osteoarthritis of both hips.  It really works - only taken for 5 days now and can already see the improvement in my walking - no pain either.</li>
    <li> Husband lives on these for his joints...he loves it.</li>
    <li> I´m using this one for the first time so I can´t guarantee the results but it was indicated by my orthopedist, so I think that is going to be fine! And a friend of mine used it already and told that really worked well to her!</li>
    <li> Improvement after one week and a half</li>
    <li> Actually I did not purchase this product for myself, it was for my mother in law (67 years). She had tried it before and she and her mom (she&#x27;s around 88 years) are very happy to buy it again. What&#x27;s prompted me to write the review is that a colleague of mine ordered it too, she&#x27;s 49 years, and had knee problems and just a week before was complaining about having to wait seconds before walking whenever she stood up. She tried it and she&#x27;s amazed at how good this product made her feel, and how her knee doesnt hurt or annoys her whenever she walks.&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommended for people with blood pressure, all noted that it&#x27;s very mild on the stomach, apart from other glucozamine products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thxx &amp; best regards from Egypt ;)</li>
    <li> We do notice a difference when we use this product no where near as stiff in the joints</li>
    <li> have been using this product for years.</li>
    <li> no effect after regular dosage for about thirty days, no easing of knee or other joint discomfort, but no bad side effects either</li>
    <li> The drugstores often have a BOGO which looks like a better price, however, those are usually the kind of which you have to take 2 or 3 tablets.  One and done with these.  I&#x27;m happy to have found them.  Oh, and the product works quite well.  I&#x27;m a runner and my knees are really never too much trouble if I take this consistently.  Reege is still going at 80 plus so hey, it can work for me and you.</li>
    <li> It is so much cheaper when you buy it in four month supplies like this one.  It has realy helped me with my knees which were so sore and it has even helped my other joints as well</li>
    <li> Not a cure-all for geezeritis, but it helps!</li>
    <li> I have used these for years and find that, for me, they do the best job. Nothing so far works for me.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had sufficient time to determine the effectiveness of this item but our son had been using it and said it helped his knee pain.</li>
    <li> use this all the time for my knees. This was a great find for the price!</li>
    <li> I say this only because I buy these for my mom to take.  So I really don&#x27;t know.  I like the convenience of having to just give her one a day rather than remembering 3x&#x27;s a day.</li>
    <li> I have found Osteo Bi-Flex to be the best brand of treatment for mild arthritis for me.  It is easy on my system and eliminates the daily pains from osteo arthritis from my hands, in particular.</li>
