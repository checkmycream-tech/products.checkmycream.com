<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> whitened teeth at least 3 shades whiter after three uses.</li>
    <li> Crest whitestips used to be stronger. They worked but my tteth are going back to the same yellow shades. I dont think the whites last as long as the original whitestrips from years back.</li>
    <li> It does give you shining teeth. But that&#x27;s it. Shining is not whitening, at least that&#x27;s how I understand it. I give this 1 star not only because it didn&#x27;t give the promised results, but also because its name is kind of misleading.</li>
    <li> prompt delivery. Item as described!</li>
    <li> These things hurt your teeth. After using out the first time I was ok. Maybe it&#x27;s just sensitive. The second time it just plain hurt. I will not be using these any longer.</li>
    <li> they work.  you donlt even know you have them on!</li>
    <li> Awesome, i got my teeth whiter in 3 days</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and it is working</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! Sensitivity is sharp, but lasts for only a day. The results are amazing if you want to tolerate to short term after effects.</li>
    <li> The bottom strip doesn&#x27;t have a rectangular shape. I can&#x27;t explain it other than to say I don&#x27;t like it. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s unique to this product, or Crest has devolved all of their strip products to this new shape.</li>
    <li> They work! I just wish they would come up with a gel that gets in between the teeth and not just the surface....</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first about whether or not these would work, but they make a world of difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought these and haven&#x27;t started the regular treatments, I decided to just start with the 1hr express strip because my teeth have been getting really yellow. The hour was fine, I expected the strips to leave a bad taste but that wasn&#x27;t really the case. It does make your mouth feel weird though and a little gross. I didn&#x27;t feel any pain either, but afterwards my teeth do feel sensitive. If you are an Invisalign user (or maybe retainers are similar) that&#x27;s kind of what it feels like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip was strong, and it didn&#x27;t slide. After the hour was up, I took off the strips and wasn&#x27;t sure if a difference had been made, but I then noticed my bottom row of teeth. I had missed one of my front teeth, and the difference was great--the whitened tooth was a whole 3~4 shades brighter. The strips are only long enough to cover your front teeth, so be careful that you center the strips when applying! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Works quickly with no sensitivity, frequently get compliments on how white my teeth are!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I drink coffee almost everyday for the last 6 years.  I gave it up and started the whitestrips.  I noticed a difference in the first few days of use.  I&#x27;m a little over halfway through the box now and I am very pleased with the results.  I do feel like it is true to it&#x27;s advertising.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My teeth are so white now!!</li>
    <li> These work great!!!  My daughter had braces for almost 6 years and was not able to use whitening toothpaste leaving her teeth dull.  She used these for 3 weeks and she has a beautiful white smile now!!</li>
    <li> It cause pain with little effect</li>
    <li> product arrived smashed...no gel on the strips...just dry and sticky...and no noticeable results after several weeks&lt;br /&gt;also web site had product listed at $31.05...my bill was $47</li>
    <li> Pricey, but they really work very well.</li>
    <li> Fantastic results! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> These definitely work!  The 1-Hour Express strips are amazing.  I tried one of those first and noticed a significant difference right away.  Make sure not to fall asleep with them on though because the tooth whitening sensitivity is excruciating!  I made that mistake.  As long as you leave them on for the correct amount of time and use them regularly it keeps your teeth looking pearly white!</li>
    <li> whiten my teeth please. it works btw I&#x27;ve gotten it before</li>
    <li> I had heard that this didn&#x27;t cause a lot of pain, even for people with sensitive teeth, so I decided it was worth a try. I didn&#x27;t have that same experience. I only used it twice. The whitening worked pretty well (I had already noticed a bit of a difference with two uses). However, even though I only used it once a week, it caused increased sensitivity and tooth pain for me that continued for weeks and weeks after I stopped. If you have sensitive teeth like me (I use pronamel toothpaste regularly) then i&#x27;d avoid this packet. Maybe I&#x27;ll try the sensitive version next, I guess.</li>
    <li> Great, worked as described</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for, teeth are whiter, will buy again</li>
    <li> Perfect, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Have ordered multiple times, works great. Anyone who doesn&#x27;t mind discomfort in their gums/teeth for the first times use should not use this. Causes sensitivity to cold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a tray style whitening product for the last year but fell out of the habit of using it because it was messy and time consuming in the sense that I had to block an hour out of my day where I couldn&#x27;t talk (not that I&#x27;m a big talker wherein an hour is that big a deal but it&#x27;s definitely inconvenient).  I had tried crest whitestrips years ago, but gave up after several days because the tooth pain was unbearable and I found them terribly difficult to keep in place - they would slide around and foam up even while trying to maintain minimal mouth movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is, these have come a long ways from the strips I originally tried in terms of staying power.  These suckers really stay on your teeth (which minimizes foaming - big time) and you don&#x27;t have to will yourself to keep your mouth in an uncomfortably still position.  You can swallow, talk, and pretty much go about your day, which makes the 30 minutes/60 minutes an effortless part of your routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news is, if you&#x27;re prone to tooth sensitivity, these are probably gonna HURT.  I never had this problem with my mouth tray but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a good or bad thing.  Perhaps my mouth tray wasn&#x27;t whitening as well as it should have and that&#x27;s why it never caused much, if any, sensitivity issues.  I used the 1 hour treatment on day 1 and within 20 minutes I felt a few zings that told me this was gonna be &#x27;fun&#x27;.  I managed to make it through the full hour and in the interim, dug out some old sensodyne toothpaste I had bought awhile ago for a minor cavity that has since been cared for, which I immediately brushed with following treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scared of the hour long treatment, I&#x27;ve opted to stick to the 30 minute strips moving forward for the time being and so far, so good.  Minor discomfort, but nothing \\&quot;Yowch!\\&quot; worthy.  At the same time, I&#x27;ve decided to continue using the sensodyne toothpaste in place of my regular toothpaste for the duration of my 20 day treatment as I&#x27;m determined to make it through the entire process this time.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s why my subsequent applications have been more bearable with no lasting discomfort after removal, or, if the 1 hour treatment is really just crazy strong (I do plan on giving that another try, but not until my last day) but I think it definitely has helped.  If you have tried teeth whitening before and couldn&#x27;t make it through the entire treatment, I would suggest giving this (senosdyne or something similar) a try during the process.  My dentist gave me the thumbs up on this as he&#x27;s assured me that any sensitivity issues from whitening is temporary and I haven&#x27;t any periodontal disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant whitening effect as of yet, even after enduring the unpleasant hour long strips experience, but it&#x27;s early yet and my teeth aren&#x27;t terribly discolored to begin with (perhaps A1 or B1; hard to tell from online photos) due to my love of black coffee and red wine.  I have one tooth with slight intrinsic staining due to trauma, about half a shade darker from the rest of my teeth, and if this can put a dent in it I&#x27;ll be floored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will report back at the end of my 20 day treatment.  The one star deduction for now is because these still hurt without a little help.  I&#x27;ll definitely bump this up to a 5 star review though if I see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*********************&lt;br /&gt;***Update 12/23/14***&lt;br /&gt;*********************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As promised, I&#x27;m back and I have decided to bump this up to a 5 star review.  I took before, during and after photos (I just can&#x27;t figure out how to add them to my reviews any longer) and I&#x27;m really glad I had because the results were gradual enough that I&#x27;d have otherwise assumed there wasn&#x27;t much of a change, but looking at photos of my teeth from start to end, I can see that my teeth are significantly whiter.  Also, I did not experience any further sensitivity issues moving forward after switching over to sensodyne toothpaste for the duration of this process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice about half ways through my white strips that my one tooth was not whitening along with the rest (the one that had some trauma) and I half expected that...  I had been advised in prior discussions with my dentist that it could be whitened, it would just require a lot of extra work since the dentin had become so dense.  Basically, for a hefty price tag, a special tray would be made to isolate that one tooth and it would take several weeks of additional in office whitening in order to match it to my other teeth.  What I ended up doing is taking an extra white strip (I&#x27;ve actually gone through two sets of whitestrips on that one tooth) and cutting it into segments to fit just that tooth in order to double up my efforts on it.  This has helped significantly.  Before, I almost considered stopping because that one tooth was starting to really stand out like a golden sore thumb - but now I&#x27;d have to really scrutinize my smile in photos in order to even notice.  I just bought a second pack of whitestrips to try and finish getting that tooth even with the rest; then I plan on using these as maintenance for my entire smile on the weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall; I&#x27;m really impressed with the results and very happy I gave this a try!odyne toothpaste for the duration of this process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice about half ways through my white strips that my one tooth was not whitening along with the rest (the one that had some trauma) and I half expected that...

    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this kit!</li>
    <li> My hygienist suggested that I use this product for the best possible results.  She was right!!</li>
    <li> I have been using these strips every other day to avoid my teeth getting overly sensitive. I have definitely already started noticing a difference after a week or two. I started with the 1-hour strip, and have been doing the 30-min strips since.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use these about 10 years ago, and they were so gross and gooey back then. They would slide off my teeth and were a huge pain. They definitely fixed that, because these suckers stay PUT! They are practically glued to your teeth while you&#x27;re wearing them, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about them coming off. And when I peel them off (yes, I have to forcefully peel mine off), they don&#x27;t leave a bunch of gross gel on my teeth. I love them!</li>
    <li> I have using it since long time and loved it as the service too!</li>
    <li> Made my teeth soooooooo much whiter. Wasn&#x27;t expecting actual results. Be aware that doing anything that makes your teeth yellow - drinking wine, smoking, whatever - makes you backslide on progress towards whiter teeth and the effects last a year or less.</li>
    <li> the stickiness on these is much improved from what it used to be, they stay on suuuuuuuuuuuuper tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only problem is my teeth won&#x27;t get any whiter :(</li>
    <li> A Few Tips:   1) Place strips on teeth a bit loosely, (but not too loosely) then, using your fingernails, or the blunt end of a pair of tweezers, press the tape into the spaces between your teeth. This is where stains love to hide, and this is a hard-to-reach area that is difficult to treat unless you actually fit the tape in-between these crevices. The strips should now fit tightly and snugly. (Of course, do this before folding the strips over and behind your back teeth.   2) Use a good coat of lip-balm or Chapstick on your lips as this product can irritate your lips and even cause mouth sores at the corners of your mouth; a coat of lip-balm can prevent this.   3) Avoid using whitening mouthwash or abrasive toothpaste during treatment, as this will aggravate sensitivity. I suggest using a mild whitening toothpaste, like \\&quot;Sensodyne Whitening\\&quot; toothpaste) You may want to avoid very cold foods and drinks during the treatment time as well, such as ice-water, as this may increase your sensitivity, too.   4) Afterwards, you may find that using a whitening pre-rinse mouthwash, with a whitening toothpaste will help keep your stains to a minimum so that you don&#x27;t need to use the Crest whitening strips so frequently. Also, perhaps once per week, you may want to give your teeth a deep cleaning with plain baking soda; it is a mild but non-harmful abrasive that helps to remove plaque that regular toothpastes are too mild to remove, thus giving your teeth a whiter appearance, as plaque gives teeth a yellowish look. And it builds up, of course, so a good, deep cleaning with baking soda truly does the trick. Keep a box in your medicine cabinet as a reminder! (And avoid gel toothpastes as they have no abrasive quality. Keep in mind that you want a toothpaste with a mild abrasive texture. This will help prevent both plaque and tartar build-up.   Good luck, and I hope that these tips help!</li>
    <li> These work great. There is barely any taste to them, they did not burn/hurt my teeth/gums at all. Would definitely purchase again. Saw results after just one 30 minute application.</li>
    <li> Honestly, pretty decent. My teeth are whiter.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t pay this much for them again though!</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;ve only done two treatments and one of the 1 hour express treatments along with the 3D White Glam Toothpaste and 3D White Glam Mouthwash and WOW, what a difference! My teeth look better than they ever have! I highly recommend this product along with the aforementioned toothpaste and mouthwash. Will purchase again and again!</li>
    <li> As described, would buy again!</li>
    <li> These are awesome. So much better than the old style strips that moved around your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;These stick to your teeth so much better and don&#x27;t taste as gross. I am very happy with the quality and also the short time it takes for my teeth to whiten and brighten.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive teeth, so finding a product that works with little side affects is difficult.&lt;br /&gt;These dont make my gums burn or my teeth hurt as bad. And I leave the strips on for about an hour to get my moneys worth!&lt;br /&gt;Do this twice a week and in no time your smile will be getting a bajillion compliments like mine does!!</li>
    <li> Great product. I especially liked the 1 hour express strips because I felt like it made the most difference in whitening my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;strips stay on well compared to some of the other brands&lt;br /&gt;makes a difference in the appearance of my teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;hassle to use</li>
    <li> good product but this must be the old kind as these strips don&#x27;t really stay put very well at all, especially compared to the ones I bought from a big box store a couple of months ago.</li>
    <li> Painful - intense tooth sensitivity ( hot / cold foods / breathing air ) for 2 days and it burned my tongue / taste buds - swelling lasted for 3-4 days. I have been using trays successfully for years with only an hour or so of (light) sensitivity after. With the trays, you can apply the gel to whiten only the front part of your teeth, and skip the sensitivity on the inside of your tooth/mouth. The whitening results with this product were not as good, either.</li>
    <li> Extreme tooth sensitivity after one use ! Waste of my dollars</li>
    <li> Very happy with these.  I have the professional trays from the dentist and don&#x27;t find them to be any better than these strips.  I double up on certain days and do morning and night to speed the process along.</li>
    <li> Been using these for a few weeks, and notice a HUGE difference. I love the fact they GRIP so well. I have the other kind, the crest strips, but then got the LUXE type. These I can place on after brushing my teeth after my coffee, and wear them on my commute to work, BINGO by the time I get to work, it is done. I have noticed a great improvement. I also follow up with the Polish after the strips.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t whiten nearly as well as they should have for as much as they cost! I almost wonder if I got a bad box</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it works. At least for me, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle!  It&#x27;s cheaper here tooðŸ˜ƒ</li>
    <li> very nice make them whiter .... but not snow white</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m torn because they work well but leave my mouth in so much pain</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  It&#x27;s pricier than some other whiteners, but it actually works, and once you have your teeth to a satisfied level of whiteness, you really only need to whiten once every 7-10 days to maintain the brightness.</li>
    <li> Out of all of the over-the-counter whitening products - strips, pastes, gels and those lights-phaserwhasterwhosits - these strips have consistently been the best overall product I&#x27;ve used for whitening. They&#x27;ve improved quite a bit over the years from the early slippery oozy gel strips and this newest version is quite sticky once you get them on and pressed in place. I have slightly sensitive teeth and if I&#x27;m careful to only keep the strips on the recommended time, I have no problems at all with irritation. If I keep them on too long, I do have a little soreness at the gumline, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any actual tooth sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the entire box of strips, I would say my teeth lightened by a couple of shades or so - I was very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m amazed! I just didn&#x27;t think these would work for me so I never purchased until recently. My teeth had become very stained and I was embarrassed. I thought all I could do was possibly have a dentist whiten them, but took a chance on this much much cheaper alternative and was shocked that I saw results immediate, even after 1-3 days. After a week of using, I&#x27;m so happy as my teeth are several shades whiter. I also was worried these would bother my gums as some have reported because I have some problems in that area. But, no, no irritation. I paid about $35 for what would have cost me hundreds at the dentist office.... but your dentist is NOT going to tell you that!!!</li>
    <li> I had used this previously with excellent results. When I saw it on Amazon with a great price I didn&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
    <li> I used these before my wedding and they work wonderfully.  The convenience of just putting a strip on your teeth to whiten them from home was very nice.</li>
    <li> used my 3rd strip, though I just felt sensitivity. it is perfect! saw the results fast!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these. I can make one box last 6 months. I usually use a couple for the first few days I have them, which whitens my teeth significantly. Then I use one either once or twice a month. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than professional whitening. If I use the strips for several days in a row, my teeth do become quite sensitive but toothpaste designed for sensitive teeth helps a lot.</li>
    <li> Good overall whitening for a fair price. The strips do irritate my teeth while many &amp;#34;Dentist&amp;#34; recommended gel whiteners don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Made my teeth very white! Not messy, my teeth got a litle sensetive after using them all but the sensitivity wasnt perminate.</li>
    <li> Used them, not continuously all at once, still have a few left now.  I like these very much. Sticking tight to teeth, not goopy, and definitely whitens!</li>
    <li> Saw result in first use. A little hard to remove, but just brush your teeth after you remove the strip and you are good to go!</li>
    <li> Great Product.  My teeth are so white, they are wearing multi-colored khaki&#x27;s to brunch.</li>
    <li> I really am impressed by these strips.  I am a dental hygienist and have seen many whitening treatments come and go.  These strips are great for teenagers that need a little extra or those that need retreatment after previous whitening.  I bleached my teeth 10 years ago and was very lucky to get very white.  Over the years of lots of coffee they have faded.  I started these strips and was impressed by how quickly they worked.  No need to go back to the bulky trays or expensive laser.  If you have very stained dark teeth, you will get some lightening but only a few shades.  Make sure you follow directions and with any bleaching, do NOT brush and floss right before using.  It will really hurt your gums.  Brush after and that&#x27;s really ok :)</li>
    <li> Love crestwhitestrips, and these work in the convenience of your home without scheduling an expensive dentist visit.</li>
    <li> I am seeing a difference each time I use it!</li>
    <li> easy to use and doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth</li>
    <li> These work like they have been known to work but they made my teeth sensitive. SO if you already have issues with sensitivity you may want to check with your dentist first. BUT they work.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get this one confused with the B1G1F that has been advertised on TV. Because it is not it. the only thing you get FREE , Is 2 one hour express strip packs. I thought it was the one that was on the commercial and had been looking for them at every store I went, to and saw this ad and thought it was the B1G1F deal. You just get the box of strips , plus 2 bonus strips.</li>
    <li> Exact package received and price is great</li>
    <li> I loved this product.  Great results. I bought this one for my husband too.  Hope it lasts. Its better tan the product I bought form my dentist.</li>
    <li> These work great! Very effective and stick to your teeth so well they&#x27;re hard to get off, but that&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I love the way the whitening &amp;#34;retainers&amp;#34; cling to your teeth during the full whitening process. I have tried other whitening systems in the past in which these fall off shortly after being placed - nowhere near the processing time for the whitening. I love this product!</li>
    <li> these are AMAZING and they do not move!!!</li>
    <li> Used the product for about a week as directed no noticeable changes yet. Comes with a 100% money back guarantee so may be taking advantage of that after a few more uses.</li>
    <li> Used for a week.  Made my teeth very sensitive.  Notice a small difference, but not a huge change in color.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant before I bought these white strips because spending that much money for a few strips were not in my schedule. But I broke down and bought it since I am planning on getting braces; so why not have white teeth to match a good mouth. Best decision of my life. My teeth are getting whiter by the day. I use them at night before I go to bed, to bleach what I had eaten and drank for the day (coffee lover, sue me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first few days I was not seeing a difference, then slowly I saw my imperfections turning white. The bottom sets of my teeth were more yellow at the base, and they cleaned them up. Be warned, don&#x27;t expect your teeth to stay white if you don&#x27;t change your eating habits! Straws are your best friend people!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave my sister the 1 hour strip so that she can test it out. I was not expecting her teeth to get white on the spot, but I also didn&#x27;t see much of a change, which is why I gave it 4 stars. When I used the other 1 hour strip, I saw an instant change, but... Read more</li>
    <li> These are the only whitestrips we have found that actually work.  Buy these, skip the Rembrandt, cause those dont work... at all.</li>
    <li> Never lets me down. I love getting a box of these once a year for maintenance. It works great and didn&#x27;t leave spots on my teeth or add to sensitivity. Love it!</li>
    <li> I was so happy with this Crest 3d White strips. It really made my teeth so white! Love it so much, will buy another one for maintenance. I really reccomend this product!!</li>
    <li> Cheaper than buying at the store. My teeth aren’t discolored, but I like to use these to add more of a pearly affect. They definitely work, try them and you won’t be disappointed. Used them for a couple years now.</li>
    <li> After using the advanced 1 hour one. my teeth were fine. then about an hour later i have this terrible pain in my teeth. not worth it at all</li>
    <li> These really work at brightening your teeth!</li>
    <li> Bottom strips did not adhere well at all. I was also very disappointed in the results. I would not buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> For the cost, it is not worth the money.  My wife used a box faithfully each night, but I have to say I don&#x27;t really notice any difference, so I am unlikely to buy them for her again.  It was a stocking stuffer last Christmas and I knew she wanted to try them, but I&#x27;m sure she would not spend the money again.</li>
    <li> Teeth seem to be much whiter.</li>
    <li> who doesn&#x27;t want dentist results without the dentist?  These work great and I don&#x27;t get the extreme sensitivity that I got from a dentist whitening</li>
    <li> Still working on them but so far, I&#x27;m very happy with the results after about 10 days of use. Teeth are a little sensitive but no pain, no gain amirite? Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These work great! With only 5 treatments my teeth are super white. I&#x27;m going to hang on to the extras and maybe use them in another 6 months or go to once a week for maintenance. I had mild tooth sensitivity but nothing unbearable and I did 5 consecutive days. I have already recommended it to friends and you should totally try it!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d bought these looking to whiten up my teeth. I used them exactly as described. After about 9 days into using them, I&#x27;d noticed a brown spot start appearing on one of my teeth and two pin size wholes on one of the other. I immediately stopped using them and now am going to need dental work to fix the problem.</li>
    <li> Used all the strips and I can agree with most reviewers even after 1 treatment it is so visibly worth it!&lt;br /&gt;It whitens and is so easy to use, you can actually do other things while having it on. I&#x27;m now buying this whenever I need my teeth whitened.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price! I followed the instructions and in three weeks time I notice a significant difference. I will definitely order them again in six months (which is the amount of time they recommend taking off between kits)</li>
    <li> I bought these from a store.  Use every other day. But effective.  i will do reviews and honest ones if you select me.  i have a youtube page.</li>
    <li> The best product and you dont have to use it everyday.</li>
    <li> To be honest with you, I did not feel much of an effect the first time I used it.  Maybe due to me being not a smoker or coffee drinker but as I went through more treatments, the whitening was more apparent.  Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> They work okay.  Not the best luck.  Still trying to decide if I would reorder or find another brand.</li>
    <li> Good result but not for sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> They really hurt my teeth.  I have used white strips before.  Maybe my teeth can&#x27;t handle one hour?</li>
    <li> Can make your teeth a little sensitive, especially if you are prone to sensitive teeth; however, it definitely makes a difference as far as whitening goes. Great product.</li>
    <li> Always have good results from this product.  I typically buy this 2 times/year and use it for the entire time and always can see an improvement!</li>
    <li> This product works wonders very quickly.  I am always getting compliments on my teeth especially from guys and as a young lady that&#x27;s an amazing feeling.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my 16-year old granddaughter.  She noticed a difference immediately but discontinue use after about a week due to sensitivity issues.</li>
    <li> These white strips are really over rated as to their ability to whiten as much as Crest claims. I have tried several different types of Crest strips and feel pretty much the same. They are also expensive which is irritating when the end result is just ok. I will say they do stay on very well for the hour I keep them in.</li>
    <li> Great product! I use it for 3 days and my teeth become whiter!</li>
    <li> Honesty have not seen a difference. Pretty disappointed .</li>
    <li> Very noticeable change in the color of my teeth. I used them everyday without any problem with sensitivity.</li>
    <li> These do whiten over time, but I cannot use them every night as described.  Even just one application makes my teeth super sensitive (side benefit, I don&#x27;t eat as much?) so I have to space out the applications to just a couple a week.  Since the price is low, it&#x27;s okay, but I&#x27;ll probably try something else next time since it is taking forever to get results.</li>
    <li> My teeth look so much whiter!  I am loving these.</li>
    <li> one of the best products I have used in a long time! Worked wonders.</li>
    <li> Thank you , its graet</li>
    <li> good for whitening, a bit stingy</li>
    <li> Eh, For the amount of money I&#x27;m sure I could have bought something a little better.</li>
    <li> Crest 3D White Professional Effects Plus 1 Hour Express Whitening... really works well. I have had great success with this product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> my teeth aren&#x27;t even yellow, but I jsut want it to be super white like the people who whiten their teeth , so got me a box .&lt;br /&gt;but it did NOTHING at all . don&#x27;t know if I should blame this or is it because my teeth doesn&#x27;t take the whitening well ? I don&#x27;t know ?&lt;br /&gt;All I know is I did follow the directions , but no whitening seen . not even 1% , i swear .</li>
    <li> not bad, great price!</li>
    <li> It works quite well, but each use caused me a significant amount of pain for about 24 hours. I probably just have sensitive teeth, but the pain was much more intense than I expected.</li>
    <li> Works good fast delivery</li>
    <li> I really like how the product works. It does almost brighten my smile immediately and I loved seeing it brighten. However, after only a couple times use in a row, my teeth got extremely sensitive and I couldn&#x27;t handle any heat, cold or too much chewing. I had to look up if others were going through the same thing and it appeared they were. My use has gone down to 1 every few days because I don&#x27;t want to experience the pain again. I experienced the pain only after using the regular ones for 30-minutes. I didn&#x27;t extend the use like you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will get results but be weary of side effects.</li>
    <li> Mostly good except that approximately 30% of the bottom strips didn&#x27;t stick at all.  They floated right off and had to be thrown away.  The strips that did stick work as advertised and I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> The 1hr express strips really do make a noticeable difference, but you should keep treating daily to maintain results. These made my teeth more sensitive than other brands I&#x27;ve tried, but they work well. Good results overall!</li>
    <li> I love the express strips - they work wonders! The standard whitestrips are also good, but the express 1hr whitening is a nice bonus!</li>
    <li> Works, but you have have to use lots of applications. They&#x27;re nice in that they have never irritated my gums like other strips have. Then again, other strips have worked a little better, with a noticeable improvement after only 2-3 applications. I would not describe this as &amp;#34;professional effects.&amp;#34; 2 stars.</li>
    <li> Have never tried using whitening strips before but really hapy with the results and keep staring at my teeth...love the look for the price, will be doing it every year now!!</li>
    <li> My box came with a 2-hour strip, which I used first. My teeth hurt SO BAD after that that I almost didn&#x27;t try the 30 minute ones!  They were much better the next day, and the day after that were totally recovered.  About a week later I finally got up the nerve to try the 30 minute ones and I wish I had done that first!  They are great, I can wear it while I&#x27;m getting ready for work and had very little sensitivity afterward.  I drink coffee daily and this is the first time in years I&#x27;ve tried a whitening treatment. I can already tell the difference after just a couple of treatments, so I&#x27;m happy with this and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> The strips are not long enough.  They only covered ½ of my teeth on top and less on the bottom.  You would have to buy 2 boxes to cover all of your teeth.  Really?  For such a high price.</li>
    <li> I have tried trays and other whiteners but this is by far the easiest and it works the best for me.  It could be the way my teeth line up so I just get good coverage.</li>
    <li> I bought a box for my daughter and I to share before purchasing two boxes. Noticed a huge difference within 3 uses (the 1 hour, and 2, 30 minute treatments)&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity but my daughter was uncomfortable for a few days after her last use. All is well now....</li>
    <li> I expected better performance from these white strips since they were so expensive. I have used cheaper ones with the same results. However, they do stay in place better than the less expensive ones.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad box, but these strips do not do anything to my teeth. They seem very dry compared to the ones I used several years ago, and I have gone through the majority of them with no changes in my teeth. Not worth buying!</li>
    <li> I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> If you follow the instructions this is a great product.  The strips stick well, they are easy to apply and the results are more than worth the minimal effort.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking that it might not really work but man was I WRONG. Works perfectly and after 5 days I started to notice a huge difference.</li>
    <li> They worked &amp; no sensitivity with my teeth either. They did make a difference.  I would try again for the price</li>
    <li> They worked o.k. didn&#x27;t have much sensitivity will try again in 6 months see if it does more whitening.Make sure you position the strips carefully to cover top to gum line.</li>
    <li> This definitely works and over time, my teeth were definitely whiter than before!</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of Crest White Strips. The Crest 3D Professional Effects have not let me down. I get compliments on my white teeth all the time. Thank you Crest!</li>
    <li> crest white strips are the best whitening product out there- i have tried many different brands and although these aren&#x27;t perfect, they definitely work well</li>
    <li> Definitely makes your teeth whiter &amp; you can definitely see the difference. However, it can easily leave white stains on your teeth, like it did on my teeth :(  The stains aren&#x27;t removable so its definitely a bummer! Other than that, I loved these.</li>
    <li> Me and my GF used these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For her they work good and she has no issues with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me I couldn&#x27;t handle it, they sent sharp shooting pains into my gums.  Had to take it out after just a couple mins.</li>
    <li> I have used many crest professional effects White strips in the past, I always go for the professional effects because I feel they are the best and the strongest for your money. I had never tried the luxe edition so I decided to try them, I am currently using them every day and will update when I finish with some photos. I did use the two included 1 hour express the first two days and took photos of my before and after for those two 1 hour express white strips. So far I am loving them and they are very comparable to previous professional effect strips I have used before.</li>
    <li> SCAM. $52 for 20 strips, where does this price come from, they are only plastic strips with gel in a shiny box, which probably costs cents for Crest to manufacture. You are paying for the brand. Crest owns the teeth whitening/cleaning industry, and this is why they can get away with upselling their products. The results are not permanent. The reality, is that teeth color is GENETIC. There are poor Africans who barely even brush their teeth and have natural pearly whites throughout their lives, while someone from the modern world, cannot get rid of his yellow teeth despite using whitening products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole teeth whitening industry is money making scam, all of the products, are overpriced and useless.</li>
    <li> This really whitens your teeth, however after doing it a few days in a row my teeth became sensitive and sore.</li>
    <li> The first treatment really seemed to make a difference.  After that, not so much, but I&#x27;m pretty convinced they work.  Pretty comfortable and don&#x27;t taste like much of anything.  A little bit tricky to put in if you have a small mouth and large fingers.</li>
    <li> This is really the best consumer teeth whitening around. The only problem is the time it needs to sit your teeth on the strips. Who here has extra two hours? I you do find the time, make sure too that no one is around because youll be salivating like a baby with it. I also used it for 2 days and took a break (because of time constraint) and I noticed that the white glow faded right away. I guess you should use it in 7 straight days as instructed.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I was a little nervous about using the express whitening strips because I can sometimes have sensitive teeth and gums.  It actually worked really well and my teeth tolerated it nicely.  I had a little sensitivity to really cold beverages afterwards but that went away after a few hours and I was back to normal the rest of the day (well - back to normal with slightly whiter teeth!).  It wasn&#x27;t a huge dramatic difference but I could definitely see the effects.  I don&#x27;t tend to use the professional effects strips consistently every day (as recommended) because after about 2-3 days my teeth do get a little sensitive to them.  I use them sporadically and still manage to see a difference.  I would probably get a bigger difference if I could use them everyday, but I&#x27;d prefer to stay comfortable.  I would not recommend going out in public with these in.  It&#x27;s a little hard to talk with them in pIace and it&#x27;s very obvious that you are wearing them.  Good to use if you have some spare time at home, though.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Looks like there is a positive outcome. But super effect is not to be expected. Anyway i will continue to use this stuff.</li>
    <li> I NOTICE A DIFFERENCE AND SO DID MY HUSBAND. I WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN. THIS ITEM GETS TWO THUMBS UP.</li>
    <li> These work great after just a few uses.</li>
    <li> amazing, you can see the result in one week, I&#x27;ll buy more of these...</li>
    <li> Did a better job than I expected.  The advanced adhesive makes the difference.  It doses take a strip or two to get the hang of applying them.  Then, so problems.</li>
    <li> My teeth get to sensitive I can not use this.</li>
    <li> the results are very amazing, you will notice the difference since day one, don&#x27;t use them more than what it says because you could get your teeth very sensitive</li>
    <li> Product is awesome, but I rated it 3 because it made my teeth very sensitive</li>
    <li> I ordered it from France and it took only 10 days for the delivery (I really appreciated the shipment tracking feature) . The strips are easy to use and stay put once applied. My teeth are not perfectly aligned so I made sure that each tooth and crevice were covered by the strips and my teeth are evenly whitened.  After reading the previous comments, I had bought a toothpaste for sensitive teeth and it helped. The first 10 days, the tip of my tongue &amp;#34;tingled&amp;#34; a bit because of the product but it was not painful and after a while, I didn&#x27;t feel it anymore. I didn&#x27;t experience any pain, my teeth were a bit more sensitive to cold but nothing more. I was able to use the 30 minutes strips for 20 days in a row without discomfort. I drink a lot of coffee and my teeth were very stained but I am very happy with the results, my teeth have never been this white before. I have not used the 1 hour strips yet, I will use them for a touch up in a few months if needed.</li>
    <li> The strips definitely worked, but I gave it 3 stars because for me, it made my teeth really sensitive. I have naturally sensitive teeth, so I couldn&#x27;t do it every day for 30 minutes like the instructions said. I eventually stuck with 15 minutes every other day. Even with the altered routine, I only used about 4 strips. However, I still noticed results with the 4 strips I used. If my teeth weren&#x27;t so, I&#x27;m sure they would have worked really well.</li>
    <li> The product did what I wanted it to do. I only used about half of the strips in the box and got the results I wanted. Now I have half a box left over for when I need them again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used White Strips in the past and have received amazing results.  These strips are much more sticky and remain securely on your teeth for the required 30 minutes.  I have very sensitive teeth and in the past have felt increased sensitivity when using the strips.  However with this specific version, I felt NO sensitivity increase.  It makes me wonder if they are working as well.  I cannot recall the variety of Crest White Strips I previously used though - price point was about the same.</li>
    <li> hold tight and stay in place</li>
    <li> Pretty easy to use, not disgusting tasting or uncomfortable.  But most important, they really do seem to whiten the teeth to a noticeable degree, even if one&#x27;s teeth are fairly white to start.  The cost is a little high, but in line with other products, many of which are actually inferior, so it&#x27;s easy to recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Really works and gel stays in place, but made my teeth sensitive after 4th or 5th use and my teeth used to be pretty healthy and with no sensitivity before</li>
    <li> I had to throw most of these strips away - they make my teeth soooo sensitive and they even hurt while I had them on plus, they don&#x27;t even work all too well. And they leave a terrible taste/smell while you wear them. I recommend going with night white strips, they are cheaper, don&#x27;t increase sensitivity and work!</li>
    <li> It whitens your teeth but makes them super sensitive.</li>
    <li> I like to whiten my teeth every Wednesday as part of my beauty routine &amp; I really enjoy these strips. They DO cause me to have sensitivity, but only to chocolate! They whiten very well &amp; are comfortable to wear for the specified time.</li>
    <li> Addicted to those strips and you can see amazing results from the 4th use.</li>
    <li> I like the monthly ship option.  Best price anywhere, works amazing.  Best to not go over the 30 minute timeframe on the daily strips if you have sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I really like these. They do work. My friend recommended cutting them in half, so they last longer. The fifty few times I was using the strips, my teeth hurt a little. I got used to it after a few uses.</li>
    <li> these work.  don&#x27;t understand why some express and the rest longer treatments.</li>
    <li> They did whiten my teeth a bit, but mine are a bit sensitive so it was tough to use them effectively.</li>
    <li> Works wonders! Though, your teeth may ache a bit. I suggest using strips every other day to let your teeth rest.</li>
    <li> Works great! Probably 3 shades lighter. Just made my teeth sensitive.</li>
    <li> it ALWAYS SLIPS!!! it becomes useless after it slips. do not use this product unless you hate yourself very much.</li>
    <li> Hello&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;And work well&lt;br /&gt;The color is also beautiful&lt;br /&gt;My sister and I love it&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
    <li> I have started using these fantastic strips , everyone asking about my tooth it looks white and different ! LOVE IT</li>
    <li> If you are going to use these, do not use them as instructed. There are many in the box, so try going for less time. Definitely don&#x27;t do it as often as they say you can. take a few days break. I bought these and used a couple, but they hurt my teeth. So instead of whitening my teeth, I decided to get a tan instead.</li>
    <li> I think its a solid four stars. The bottom strip didnt stick as good, cause my teeth got wet. I only tried the Express one so far. Which made my theeth a little lighter. I had had no great sensitivity on my teeth afterwards. So thumbs up for that.</li>
    <li> These work great, and are my go to when my teeth need some touch ups. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> That stuff works !!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been on it for 2 weeks and on of my friend whom didn&#x27;t know i was whitening my teeth actually noticed a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;It really is worth it. I have to be honest though as i have sensitive teeth, it made it a bit more sensitive to cold and hot food right after using. But I usually brush my teeth with a product for sensitive teeth and it was really fine.</li>
    <li> These white strips made my teeth extremely sensitive and &amp;#34;patchy white&amp;#34;. I could not eat or drink anything for a couple of days. Even room temperature water caused extreme toothaches. I was so discouraged by the sensitivity it had given me, I decided to not use the other set of strips.&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive teeth, please consider this a warning!</li>
    <li> Good product. I smoke &amp; drink a lot of coffee. This product works great. I go to sleep with them on and take them off in morning.</li>
    <li> Bough tthis for my teenage son. Results after two days. Used all of his strips and his teeth look amazing. Sensitivity once or twice, so he just skipped a day in between treatments here and there. He hasn&#x27;t used the one hour treatments yet. He plans to u we those for follow-up treatments. I bought some for myself and will use them soon.</li>
    <li> I got my order faster than expected, thank you! Product really DOES WORK! Tooth are sensitive a little bit, but result is beautiful</li>
    <li> The strips made my teeth very sensitive. I think that is normal. I can not use them daily so there is no real difference in my teeth color. If you can tolerate the sensitivity, it may work for you.</li>
    <li> It incredible but that products is very bad. The strips&#x27;s size is not the best. For example. The upper is bigger than lower and if you see your mouth (teeth) you will see that you have almost the same size in both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When used that, i was able just to cover the front of my teeth and my back teeth were uncovered. :S&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will have just the middle of your smile white and the rest with different color.</li>
    <li> I have only use two whitening strips so far and I can already see a difference in my teeth. Very happy!</li>
    <li> I found out that if I use three treatments and then mix together one half a teaspoon of peroxide and a half of a half teaspoon of baking soda to make a minimally goopy(semi-thick) mixture. Brush the teeth thoroughly with the mixture.Every month I would use the Crest about six times with the baking soda mix the remainder of the time. Your teeth will look professionally white and spotless.. I had no problems with sensitivity..</li>
    <li> They work great! They leave my teeth a little sensitive so I use them about once a week instead of everyday like it says but they are working wonders on my teeth!</li>
    <li> You can get generic whitestrips cheaper, but the quality of application for the Crest line is what keeps me coming back. Results are not life-changing but they are there. I just use a box once a year to reduce stains from the past few months.</li>
    <li> These do a great job at whitening your teeth… The only complaint would be the first time I used them they left my teeth throbbing afterwards… But after get used to it on the second third or fourth time everything seems to be OK.  I&#x27;ve never used a teeth whitening kit so that might be normal I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
    <li> These strips do whiten your teeth really well</li>
    <li> I was hesitant before I bought these white strips because spending that much money for a few strips were not in my schedule. But I broke down and bought it since I am planning on getting braces; so why not have white teeth to match a good mouth. Best decision of my life. My teeth are getting whiter by the day. I use them at night before I go to bed,  to bleach what I had eaten and drank for the day (coffee lover, sue me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For the first few days I was not seeing a difference, then slowly I saw my imperfections turning white. The bottom sets of my teeth were more yellow at the base, and they cleaned them up. Be warned, don&#x27;t expect your teeth to stay white if you don&#x27;t change your eating habits! Straws are your best friend people!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I gave my sister the 1 hour strip so that she can test it out. I was not expecting her teeth to get white on the spot, but I also didn&#x27;t see much of a change, which is why I gave it 4 stars. When I used the other 1 hour strip, I saw an instant change, but this was after days of using the 30 minute strips. It works more on some than on others. I recommend it, but don&#x27;t be that person that thinks it makes your teeth white in one shot, it takes time buddy.</li>
    <li> Worked great - there was a noticeable difference after just a few uses.</li>
    <li> Def see a difference!</li>
    <li> Only 2 of the 22 treatments in the package are 1 hour whitestrips. Very disappointing. Need to label it honestly.</li>
    <li> Love crest white strips.  The 1 hr strips will completely revitalize your smile in an hour and the 30 min strips are great for putting on to get ready for an occasion.  The price was fantastic and shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> It works great now I have a shiny white smile and I will order in the future from crest products</li>
    <li> I have used for quite some time.. and it works very well.. Nice smile and nice teeth are a must.</li>
    <li> The strips work very well. They whitened my teeth at least a few shades whiter, however they are hard to put on if your teeth aren&#x27;t perfectly straight, they leave a gross tasting filmy gunk (peroxide) on your teeth when you pull the strip off, and I did have some sensitivity, which they do warn you about and they also have a toothpaste to help with the sensitivity. Mine resolved, so I didn&#x27;t need to use the sensitivity toothpaste. Overall, they work great and are so much more affordable than having the dentist do it!</li>
    <li> Great Price and bonuses too!!</li>
    <li> Nice at home whitening system. I use it to maintain my white teeth with all the coffee I drink. Can leave the teeth sensitive to hot and cold for a day but it&#x27;s mild and goes away quickly so if that happen just take a day or two break.</li>
    <li> I saw results quickly, but I have sensitive teeth. My fianc&amp;eacute;e used these after I realized my issue and she loves them. Worth every penny. I will check out the version for sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these but there is a secret....have your cleaning done before you use them and they work so much faster</li>
    <li> When I was a kid I was over-floridinated leading to a few white marks on my teeth. I have been looking for a decent solution short of cosmetic dentistry and I think these have been the best solution yet. I have done professional whitening with mixed/ short lasting results. Since I do these strips every day (for 20 days) the results are lasting. I have been impressed with the ability of these strips to stay on. They have really improved these strips from the original kind that seemed to slide around and fall off if you opened your mouth. Once these are in place they stay in place for the duration of you wearing them. I will be purchasing these again</li>
    <li> At the age of 70 the Crest 3D Professional strips worked so well that both my dental hygenist and dentist independently commented on how white my teeth are and asked which brand I used. Definately will use  Crest again and the price on Amazon is amazing. Bargain brands are not a bargain if they do not work!</li>
    <li> I love it so much .. I received it also on item which is very good for me .. so buy it and Smile :D</li>
    <li> Easy to use, seen a difference immediately!</li>
    <li> After several days, my teeth does got a little whiter than before, but it does cause some sensitive pain beneath the teeth.</li>
    <li> Made my teeth REAAAAAAAL NICE N WHITE</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. My teeth are noticeably whiter. The process is easy and better than a few years ago. The HD strips are a big boost to the results. I wish they were available to be purchased separately. My dentist wanted $250 to whiten my teeth so this box is a bargain.</li>
    <li> I was thinking of getting my teeth professionally whitened, until I found out about these. People can see the noticiable difference in my teeth within days. I use to have very dull yellow teeth, now I get compliments on them. They do make some of my teeth feel a bit sensitive though. It says to use everyday, but I think it&#x27;s better to skip a few days &amp; keep using until you get your desired white teeth. Save a few to whiten a couple times in the future to maintain them. I usually buy a new box each year. It&#x27;s affordable, it works.</li>
    <li> Love them. Must leave on a good hour wo eating or drinking or effect very very diminished.</li>
    <li> Great product, works well. Subtle whitening after each use, so you really see that it&#x27;s working. The 1-hour express strip demos that came with this box work extremely well, too.</li>
    <li> This product did a great job.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great product.</li>
    <li> I have SUPER sensitive teeth, but so long as I whitened every other day, my teeth were fine</li>
    <li> I love these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used them for the instructed time and my teeth came up a few shades lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did experience a bit of pain by the 3rd day of use, which I know is normal, so I backed the use down and skipped some days. The pain eased and I carried on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how these compare to the professional job done by a dentist, but they worked great for me and I wouldn&#x27;t really want my teeth any whiter. It just looks fake if you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful not to eat or drink dark foods before or after use and don&#x27;t brush right afterwards or it will hurt!</li>
    <li> Gift for my son he loves it.</li>
    <li> Instead of using white strips on consecutive days, I use them about once a week to brighten my teeth up.  These work really well, and my teeth look great after using them.  They&#x27;re thicker, and stick to the teeth better than other thinner ones that tend to move around too much.</li>
    <li> Who wants yellow teeth?  These whitestrips keep getting better - the fit on teeth keeps improving, the wear time keeps getting shorter, and the effectiveness keeps going up at least in my experience.  Progress is great - I used to remember going to dentist office for $500 goop trays that were really uncomfortable and made me gag.  Flash forward to the year 2013 and I can stick these things to my teeth for a few hours while I&#x27;m watching the football game - faster, cheaper.  Now if I could just find a good hiding spot so my wife doesn&#x27;t take them all.  5-stars from me.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an affordable and easy way to brighten your smile, give Crest a try. I buy Crest toothpaste whenever possible, and I do the same for white strips. These are great if you need to whiten your teeth before an upcoming event or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Beats the price a dentist would charge, by far.&lt;br /&gt;- Get noticeable results (although you won&#x27;t blind anyone).&lt;br /&gt;- They do not appear harmful to sensitive teeth, which I consider myself to have.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to apply and remove.&lt;br /&gt;- See results after just a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Slightly awkward wearing the strips, but it&#x27;s expected.</li>
    <li> A Few Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1) Place strips on teeth a bit loosely, (but not too loosely) then, using your fingernails, or the blunt end of a pair of tweezers, press the tape into the spaces between your teeth. This is where stains love to hide, and this is a hard-to-reach area that is difficult to treat unless you actually fit the tape in-between these crevices. The strips should now fit tightly and snugly. (Of course, do this before folding the strips over and behind your back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;2) Use a good coat of lip-balm or Chapstick on your lips as this product can irritate your lips and even cause mouth sores at the corners of your mouth; a coat of lip-balm can prevent this.&lt;br /&gt;3) Avoid using whitening mouthwash or abrasive toothpaste during treatment, as this will aggravate sensitivity. I suggest using a mild whitening toothpaste, like &amp;#34;Sensodyne Whitening&amp;#34; toothpaste) You may want to avoid very cold foods and drinks during the treatment time as well, such as ice-water, as this may increase your sensiti...

    <li> These hurt the heck out of my teeth! I used one and will never use again! My teeth hurt for 3 days after using these :(</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice ang good it&#x27;s high quality</li>
    <li> There are some very detailed reviews on here, so I&#x27;ll keep this short. I&#x27;m on my 2nd kit, and I truly believe that they work. Use them right, brush, and floss and you should see an improvement in no-time.</li>
    <li> The one hour strips are fantastic.  I don&#x27;t have much patience to wait for the half hour ones to show results so the one hour ones are a great starting point.</li>
    <li> I remember years ago, I considered asking my dentist to whiten my teeth but the $350+ expense didn&#x27;t fit my budget. I am glad I waited.  Now, my dentist recommends the over-the-counter products such as Crest 3D.  I tried this with skepticism, but my teeth are whiter and brighter.  Years of coffee stains removed!  I have sensitive teeth and using the strips is better than using trays, so this is a great option for me.  I have noticed that after finishing all the strips my teeth are more sensitive, but tolerable.  I will get a fluoride treatment when I see my dentist soon as that usually helps the sensitivity. Overall, I highly recommend Crest 3D as it is so nice to have a brighter, healthier looking smile : )</li>
    <li> Great teeth whitening product.  There&#x27;s a ton of applications per box.  This is the best whitening product I&#x27;ve come across, and the price is reasonable to me.</li>
    <li> Love these Whitestrips!</li>
    <li> Dentist can&#x27;t believe how white my teeth are. I&#x27;ve spent 100&#x27;s on more expensive treatments but this is truly all you need!!</li>
    <li> Actually get better results with these than my 300 dollar tray I got from my dentist.  This is the way to go if you want to whiten your teeth.  I tried the strips when they first came out and these are much better now.  They stick to your teeth now and stay put.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even use them all to get the desired results.</li>
    <li> These whitening strips actually work really well. I think the last time I tried whitening strips was around 5 years ago, and they have really improved. This kit is a great value. I used one of the 1 hour express strips first and noticed a big difference. And then I used about 12 of the professional effects. I wondered why they say not to use them right after brushing your teeth, but I did one time, and my gums hurt. So that may be why.</li>
    <li> Good product works wonders on whitening my teeth :)</li>
    <li> Notice the effect from the second day! But the pain started in day 5, so, i stopped it in day 7.</li>
    <li> These white strips work.. Simple as.. They whiten your teeth and give you a nice fresh smile.. Only 1 downside, I experienced sensitivity so only used them every second day, the sensitivity goes after a few days of non use, so worth the discomfort in my opinion.. Leaving a nice white bright happy smile 😀</li>
    <li> I use these strips about 2-3 times a year. Definitely before Christmas time or any big event I&#x27;ll be taking pictures at. They don&#x27;t taste horrible, (in my humble opinion). I&#x27;ve actually tried about 3 other whitening strip brands which were a huge let down compared to these. I feel like they could be a bit cheaper but since they are the best out now I guess they have no competition.</li>
    <li> I am a coffee &amp; cola drinker.  1-2 cups of coffee and 1 can of cola per day.  My teeth have started to stain because of this, so I thought I would try these strips.  I used one of the 1 hour strips and also a few of the 30 min strips, but there has been no noticeable difference.  I did feel a very slight bit of sensitivity with the 1-hour strip, but it wasn&#x27;t that bad the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is because the strips do adhere extremely well and you don&#x27;t really notice them much when they are on -- especially compared to the older style teeth trays.  They just don&#x27;t seem to have any whitening effect for me.</li>
    <li> fast shipping, would buy again</li>
    <li> Great whitening system. Very easy and mess free. I can whiten while doing other things. Very pleased with the fast whitening of my teeth.</li>
    <li> No Question... It worked. I was worried about efficacy when I bought this. It worked great and it was noticeable to people that see me on a regular basis! You should know that it does not work on previous dental work, which came up because one of my front teeth had a filing that was matched with the surrounding teeth. So, one of my front teeth is a little more yellow then the others. I have been told that it is not noticeable, but that shows the magnitude of its efficacy. I have no hesitation about buying this again! It worked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as an FYI: try to keep it off your gums as much as possible as it can irritate. Once I learned this, gum sensitivity stopped within a day or so.</li>
    <li> The difference is unbelievable. My teeth are way whiter than they used to be, even though I haven&#x27;t finished the pack yet. I&#x27;m on my 11th stripes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended :)</li>
    <li> These work great! With only 5 treatments my teeth are super white. I&#x27;m going to hang on to the extras and maybe use them in another 6 months or go to once a week for maintenance. I had mild tooth sensitivity but nothing unbearable and I did 5 consecutive days. I have already recommended it to friends and you should totally try it!!!</li>
    <li> It does make your teeth really white but it hurts my teeth after I take them off.</li>
    <li> Burns my Gums and Made my teeth Really sensitive. But they did get white.</li>
    <li> These things are incredible. I love them and couldn&#x27;t be happy without them. I trim them shorter to keep them from wrapping too far over my teeth, cut some of it away from my gums and use enamel building toothpaste before and during. When my teeth start to feel a little tender (which isn&#x27;t too often I&#x27;ve been able to use these everyday!) I use a remineralization gel in a tray overnight and the discomfort is GONE!</li>
    <li> really works, no gum irritation</li>
    <li> They work well.  I use them for about 2 hours per application to get the most dramatic effect without too much sensitivity.  I also use a sensitive toothpaste before and after.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from Germany and I now ordered Crest 3D White Whitestrips for the 3rd time because there is no such good Whitening Strips available here in Germany. I just love it and it won&#x27;t be the last time I ordered it on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> My teeth have significantly improved. Everybody asking me how is your teeth so white. I&#x27;m going to buy it again next year.</li>
    <li> Work very well - get tons of compliments on my teeth now ;)</li>
    <li> Work well. Much easier and cheaper than ZOOM whitening.</li>
    <li> Such an improved product from the original strips. These don&#x27;t slide all over your teeth. They are almost like tape and stay well on your teeth. Easy to remove, though.&lt;br /&gt;I use them maybe once or twice a year, and get compliments on how white my teeth are. Sometimes I only use half the box and save the rest for several months later. I will never get teeth whitened at a dentist. Too pricy when I can do it at home and it&#x27;s so easy and convenient. Love these strips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to the Crest website. They often have mail-in rebates for $10. It makes it more affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hooked on these. I swear by them!</li>
    <li> Surprisingly this product seriously works great and makes my teeth feel clean, too!</li>
    <li> Some results, but not very significant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got some crooked teeth, never could afford orthadonture, but noone seems to care when ypur teeth are white. I get lots of compliments on my &amp;#34; beautiful smile &amp;#34; just because my teeth are white, and noone notices my crooked grill. I get a pack of 20, use 6 the first month, and one a month for the rest of the year for maintenance.</li>
    <li> I used half a box so far because I had an interview and wedding within a week, I noticed significant increase in luster and my teeth became pearly white. I had nearly white teeth to begin with, so this was just a quick one over to go the extra mile. I used the half box about 2 months ago, and the luster has gone but the whitening has remained so I am very satisfied. I purchased a cheaper version several years back that was terrible and I was reluctant to try crest because of the price and would think by now that competition would drop the price more but none the less the product still works great.</li>
    <li> I would use nothing else besides Crest White Strips.... they were amazingly and I get compliments from my Dentists, along with everybody else. Just don&#x27;t stain your teath with smoking and coffee ect... and you&#x27;ll be blingin!</li>
    <li> these things really work.  my teeth have gotten so white and bright, I cannot live without the strips.  They aren&#x27;t going to work miracles but if you have minor staining (coffee, soda, etc.) these will do the trick everytime!</li>
    <li> After using the everyday treatment, I my teeth became very sensitive and then a couple of hours later I started to have a terrible pain in my teeth. I had it for the whole night and for the whole next day! Terrible experience! I am afraid to us it again!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use. Just make sure you do proper placement. I always make sure I cover the entire front teeth.&lt;br /&gt;- Whitens teeth to some extent (You can see the white marks on the sides of some teeth after using which I experience whenever I get my teeth bleached by the dentist)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Makes my teeth a little sensitive (tolerable) making me unable to use it regularly. I just skip a few days then resume using it again.&lt;br /&gt;- I can taste the formula&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this whenever I feel like my teeth has some uneven stain from colored beverages. It helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolute loving this product. Since I started using the strips I&#x27;ve noticed a definite hue shift in the color of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real issue with the white strips so far has been the sensitivity my teeth sometimes feel after I&#x27;ve had these on for awhile. I&#x27;m guessing this is a normal thing for these sort of products though so I&#x27;ve just kept using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll buy any more of these because of the price but if you&#x27;re in need of a quick whitening these strips seem to do the job and do it well.</li>
    <li> they work ok. The ones that I received last time worked much better than these do. Not sure why but I noticed a big difference in the effects. Last time I gave this item a five star this time its a 3. &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> Perfect combo with the Crest 3D White toothpaste along with the strips.  Its safe enough to use everyday.</li>
    <li> WOW!!!! My teeth have always been pretty yellow, but after whitening for a couple of weeks I noticed a huge difference. My friends and family can&#x27;t stop commenting on my teeth! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the pain factor. This is definitely not a product for someone with a low pain tolerance. When using the 1-hour whitening strips, I experienced tremendous pain and had to take several advil to even slightly numb it (although it made a HUGE and immediate difference). But if you have a high pain tolerance, this is definitely a great investment.</li>
    <li> I cut the strips in half and use one for the top and one for the bottom. Great way to extend the use of the strips.</li>
    <li> Makes a slight difference.  I already had seventy white teeth just wanted to go the extra step.  Teeth sensitive for the first few days but nothing extreme. Good product.</li>
    <li> I use these as often as I am able to make myself do these, but they make my teeth hurt for an entire day afterward. So sensitive! And gets minimal results. Eh overall. Would not buy again...perhaps consider cheaper brand, may get better results for less than this!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve done a treatment using the Crest strips.  I like them.  They are easy to use, and they do get your teeth whiter, and the price is also reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had a treatment by my dentist some years ago.  The big difference is that at the dentist they give you a mold of your teeth, and so the whitening is applied to all surfaces of your tooth and whitens the entire tooth.  With the Crest strips, you are only getting whitening to the front surface, and even then, it doesn&#x27;t fit perfectly to your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the price and the convenience make these worthwhile.</li>
    <li> Crest 3D White Professional Effects Plus 2 Hour Express Whitening Treatment does a really good job of getting your teeth to a nice shade of white. I&#x27;ve been a fan of Crest White Strips since they first came on the market some years back. I love how the improvements Crest has made over the years and these ones follow that upgrade trend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips are much more to my liking that the dental trays filled with goo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results I got. The 2 Hour Express Whitening Treatments I&#x27;m saving for special events when I need a little extra wow in my smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another wonderful product in Crest&#x27;s line of dental hygiene products.</li>
    <li> While these are a huge improvement over white strips I tried in the past (mostly due to how well they adhere to the teeth - these adhere beautifully!), they didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth as well as I&#x27;d expected.  I just recently developed a slight staining on my front 2 lower teeth probably thanks to my love for black tea.  After the first use of the 3D Whitestripe I immediately noticed the stain was faded a good amount.  The next day I applied a second strip &amp; again noticed the same great results.  However after completing the entire box, the stain is still there although it is minimal. I didn&#x27;t get the same good results with the remaining applications as I had with the first two.  On top of that these made my teeth crazy sensitive.  At first I was able to use the strips once a day.  Than I could go 2 days on 1 day off.  Then I had to go down to every other day until I went 2 days off, 1 day on.  My teeth became so sensitive that the pain would last the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely use them again, but not in the same way - using the whole box in one shot because I feel it is a waste.  I would go for about 2 - 3 whitening sessions as needed.  If it is done this way, one box will probably cover a years worth of mini treatments, it will hurt less &amp; be just as effective as using the full months treatment in one shot.</li>
    <li> I smoke and drink at least two pots of coffee a day, but with these, my teeth stay white.  Not quite as good as a professional whitening, but still... it works!  Can&#x27;t use it more than 3-4 days at a time, though because my teeth start to hurt.  Kinda that ice cream, frozen, kinda pain.  But using 2-3 days at a time 3-4 wks at a time, it keeps me smiling white and happy with my teeth.</li>
    <li> A bit of a necessity for a better presentation of ageing teeth and coffee drinkers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the regular strips for some time now, but tonight was the first time I decided to use the 2 Hour Express Treatment. It went as good as I&#x27;d hoped it would and my teeth actually feel a little cleaner, too. My teeth don&#x27;t ache as I&#x27;d anticipated so everything seems like it turned out well! Gave it 4 stars because even after the 2 hour treatment my teeth aren&#x27;t as white as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Approximately 8 hours after removing the strips my teeth got sensitive; really sensitive. Now, 24 hours later my teeth are back to normal and seem to have whitened up even a bit more than when I originally pulled the strips. Bumping to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Best product for teeth whitening and after doing research on prices again Amazon wins!!</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with teeth whitening and I have tried many products and treatments.  I seem to always come back to one of the originals - Crest Whitestrips.  This 3D version adheres much better than prior versions, these things are not going to fall off while you are talking.  I find that if I do a few for a few days, I am in a good place - I rarely need to do the full 2 week treatment.  The 2 hour express was new to me, I had a hard time finding a good 2 hours to leave them on where I didn&#x27;t need to eat, drink, or basically be somewhere.  So the most I left them on was an hour - but still what an improvement!  Can&#x27;t recommend these strips enough, try them.</li>
    <li> Time will tell as to how much damage my teeth have incurred while using this, but I am about 2/3 through the 20 day treatment and I am seeing a difference. I find the strips are easy to place, almost tasteless and stick fairly well to my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the tooth discomfort some people are reporting, mine has been minimal, even with daily applications. I do, however, use Sensodyne toothpaste and I am sure that this has helped with discomfort. Might be a good idea to start using it if you are planning on doing a whitening regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the color of my teeth, I am only trying to rid myself of coffee stains, so I was worried that these might be too powerful for my teeth, as smokers have reported very good results with the strips removing years of tobacco stains. They seem to be gentle enough and I haven&#x27;t hit the dreaded &amp;#34;Day-Glo White&amp;#34; phase of whitening, so I am going to keep with it until I finish the strips. At this point my teeth are brighter but not unnaturally so, which is all I wanted.</li>
    <li> THEY WORK!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have teeth sensitivity and I found that sometimes I had to skip a day here and there as my teeth did become uncomfortable with sensitivity with this product. A little more than with the less stronger strips from this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product mostly once a day...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw fantastic results, which was great since I hadn&#x27;t whitened my teeth in over a year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I did find my teeth had to endure a longer time of being uncomfortable compared with less stronger whiteners, it was well worth the results!&lt;br /&gt;Just a heads up to anyone with very sensitive teeth. I&#x27;d recommend using just once a day, maybe every couple of days if your teeth or really sensitive. Though if you use these 2xs a day you&#x27;ll see results much quicker. (I used 2xs a day towards the end of the box!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleans Hard To Reach Spots&lt;br /&gt;Clean Teeth&lt;br /&gt;Durable&lt;br /&gt;Easy To Use&lt;br /&gt;No slip&lt;br /&gt;Not too rough on gums&lt;br /&gt;You can talk with them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Hard to remove</li>
    <li> its awesome .. get it .</li>
    <li> Whitens your teeth pretty well. Did not have any sensitivity issues like some people. I recommend these as an alternative to going to a dentist and paying for a whitening.</li>
    <li> When I received the product, I was a little daunted by the idea that I would have to use this for 30 mins everyday until 20 days are over. This can get annoying after awhile as you try to remind yourself to do it. Thankfully, it pays off because I started to get compliments about the nice white color of my teeth after the treatment was over. I&#x27;ve had yellow teeth my whole life but this changed that. I would recommend this with a 5 star review, but I think it is way too expensive. Get it for ~$30 at walmart if the amazon price is higher. Still, this is much better than paying thousands of dollars for professional treatment.</li>
    <li> They seem to work pretty well, but caused some discomfort from some tooth sensitivity. I have to space them out quite a bit.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. (I especially love the 1hr express strips).</li>
    <li> Worked almost immediately and better than my dental treatments in the past.  I wish that I had used this earlier.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product, my teeth seem cleaner, I havent got to the results I want yet but am  on my way! For those with sensitive teeth I recommend using them every third day</li>
    <li> these work wonders. so when they are on sale,  being that they are worth the expensive price tag, and also  include other free services of even higher caliber to try out,  sign me up.</li>
    <li> This is our second time purchasing the Crest 3D White Professional Effects strips and we are highly satisfied with the results!  It works just as described and makes a difference in the whiteness of your teeth after just one or two treatments.  It is extremely easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take a huge time commitment or money investment.  When I ask my dentist about whitening, he recommended these strips, that should tel you something!</li>
    <li> I have white teeth anyway so no major staining. But I have used store brands of these strips because of price. The store brand ones always seem to slide up or down &amp; I have to keep positioning until the time is up. These actually stayed in place the whole time and did not have the &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; goo left on my teeth when removed like the store/cheaper brands. And they really whitened quickly! My teeth were a bit sensitive later that night which has never happened before with other brands.  But I highly recommend this product &amp; will stick with unless I find something even better.</li>
    <li> They work beautifully!! They did make my teeth a little sensitive but it goes away...use toothpaste for sensitive teeth.  Great pricing on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Worked well after my first night. i can feel the difference on my teeths surface, didn&#x27;t experience much tooth sensitivity.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I have used one of the 30 minute strips so far, and while it didn&#x27;t have dramatic whitening results immediately, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to after only one use. I did notice, though, that I have had no sensitivity so far, and the strips are DRAMATICALLY improved since the beginning of white strips. Before, your whole mouth would fill up with gel and the taste of peroxide, and you would have to be careful not to move the strips around or let them slip off. These really stick well. Enough that they stuck to my lip for a second as I was trying to apply them to my lower teeth. While they stuck really well and were sturdier than their ancestors, they were not difficult to remove. I think the most surprising part was when I took them off, I didn&#x27;t have goo coating my teeth. There was only a little residual gel leftover... Not even enough to make me immediately rush for my toothbrush. Overall, I was pretty impressed. The only difficulty I encountered was getting them on straight and avoiding my lips, and had to make a little extra effort to make sure they were touching my teeth evenly (due to the sturdier material, they weren&#x27;t quite as flexible as they used to be; a pro and con).</li>
    <li> Needed to brighten my smile after 40 years of smoking cigarettes. I finally stopped smoking and now was the time to start. The coffee and tobacco stains were just shamefull. I&#x27;ve seen all the TV commercials for bleaching but was hesitant to go to the dentist and pay the high price. So,I thought I would try Crest Luxe Professional White strips. I must say once I used the 1 hour strips I saw an immediate difference! Not bright white, but several shades lighter and certainly enough of a difference for me to continue with the 3D Luxe Toothpaste and 30 minute maintenance strips. It&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks since I started the therapy and people can already notice the difference in my smile. Definately worth a try!</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. Works as promised. I&#x27;m very satisfied. I would gladly recommend it to all of my friends or anyone else who would be interested in teeth whitening.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and effective, which I was pleasantly surprised to find out. They do cause some tenderness the next day, but that is expected.</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;m not going to pretend I understand the title of this product, having just typed it.  As a teeth whitener, its not bad...my teeth became sensitive using it, but not to an unbearable degree.  It does seemed to have lightened my teeth and for an over the counter product, that&#x27;s what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of shades, I believe after two applications that my teeth were maybe 35% lighter.  I only hope they stay that way!</li>
    <li> I love Crest White Strips. If I were a hoarder, I would hoard Crest White Strips because I have a number of people who live with me and they love them too.&lt;br /&gt;So ask me what I did with these until I was ready to review them.&lt;br /&gt;I HID THEM.&lt;br /&gt;That is the truth.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want anyone to try the newer 2 hour Express Whitening Treatment Strips, as I had never used those yet. I love the regular Crest 3D White Professional Effect ones and the only trouble with them is it is hard to stick to the schedule of using them every day for a week or ten days. I would far rather use a whitening strip for two hours straight than have to think and plan for a week or more to get my teeth looking their best. And my teeth do look their best using either of these two types of strips by Crest, as directed. I can tell you that now because I just finished using the two hour version and my teeth look:&lt;br /&gt;really good!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, if you have a rush&lt;br /&gt;party or event on your schedule and you have not&lt;br /&gt;been regularly whitening your teeth for a while, having this on hand if you have two hours and a bit of patience (I passed the time writing on the computer) REALLY is a MAJOR BOON,if you have teeth that is, and they are not all capped (these do not work on crowns or caps).&lt;br /&gt;Give these a try, I urge you. You will be so pleased with both types!&lt;br /&gt;A five star product&lt;br /&gt;You deserve it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best wishes,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jean</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest White Professional Effects strips off and on for years and have always been pleased with the results. I will say, I tried the Express Whitening strips that are included with this and, after the recommended 2 hours, really didn&#x27;t notice a difference at all.  That is why I dinged the product one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Over a few days, they really do whiten the teeth and bleach out coffee and tea stains.&lt;br /&gt;I have&#x27;t had any sensitivity issues.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and don&#x27;t have to be worn for an extended period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t found any yet!</li>
    <li> did not work as advertised</li>
    <li> Without a doubt, Crest 3D Whitestrips work. I usually start a treatment period with one day of 2 of the 1-Hour Express strips, then follow up with 2 of the 30-minute strips each day after that. After that start up whitening regimen, I only periodically need to whiten--usually just two 30-min. treatments every other week do the job. I&#x27;m not lying when I say that people actually do ask me &amp;#34;How do you get your teeth so white?&amp;#34;. It really is the Crest Whitestrips. I will forever be a buyer of this product.</li>
    <li> I used these strips without high expectations about their effectiveness and I was pleasantly surprised that I did notice a difference in my teeth color after only a few hours. The strips are easy to apply to your teeth and for having these on your teeth for two hours, they did stay in place very well. Other strips I&#x27;ve tried moved around once I had them in place and I had to constantly adjust them. Not with these strips. The only downfall, for me, with these strips is that I did experience an uncomfortable sensitivity in my teeth and gums for several days after using them. For those few days, anything very cold, or hot made my teeth hurt. So, while these strips do indeed whitened your teeth, you may want to be warned about the increased sensitivity your may experience afterward.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth, and I was really worried that these strips (especially the 2-hour treatment strips) would be unbearable for me. But I have to say, I am so pleased with the process and the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t follow the directions exactly; in fact, it took me a couple months to finish the box of strips. But giving myself a day or two off between strips helped me avoid any serious discomfort. The two-hour treatment strips did give me some pain for a couple days after I used them, but, again, it wasn&#x27;t terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most important, my teeth definitely look whiter. I&#x27;m so happy I tried these!</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t care for the extra 2-hour express strips, because it looks unnatural to go out with lighter teeth than you had the day before, but overall this is a good value, for both time and money, compared with dentist whitening. Very happy with the set!</li>
    <li> Would rte lower because of the cost, but these strips work better than any of the other whiteners in the Crest line!</li>
    <li> Whitened my teeth with no sensitivity issues. I used the one hour strips first.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm and as advertised.</li>
    <li> I love the ability to whiten my teech using strips such as these, but after my using them, and two other family members, and having independent use of cheaper, generic versions, I gotta say: these do exactly as advertised, but the generic strips worked--in MY opinion--just as good, all while saving close to 45% off what Crest charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, it is not my intent to knock Crest or their products. They really work. Really well, in fact. But for the budget conscience individual, I can see the need to whiten your teeth while needing to save money as much as possible...which is why I recommend doing a little research and asking around and maybe you can get the same results as a member of my family did at possibly substantial savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just sayin&#x27;.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE  good price ,came quickly!! Did I say I loved these ? lol.. You want the whitest teeth without going to a professional to pay hundreds of dollars ? Use these !!</li>
    <li> My wife has been using these and we can really tell the difference in how bright her teeth look. One side effect most everyone has already mentioned is your teeth will get sore. There isn&#x27;t anything you can really do about it but sleep it off and usually by the next day you feel fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is how expensive they are but they did work as advertised. I am not quite convinced that these do anymore than the lower tier Crest Whitening strips and may try out a cheaper package next time.</li>
    <li> Someone at the manufacturing facility for Crest is swapping out the 1 hour or 2 hour express strips with regular ones. I found a bunch on ebay so I am guessing that&#x27;s where they are ending up. Crest needs to learn how to control their inventory. I have to deal with returning the entire box in hopes that the next one has not be looted by the employees at the manufacturing facility. This is my last box of Crest white strips.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful.. easy to use, and I saw a difference the very first time.  I am a regular brusher, and I use toothpaste with whitener, and it is expensive.. I never saw a difference, with this I saw a difference right away, I am very pleased with this and will continue to use.  I highly recommend this for everyone.  It is also extremely to use and not messy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIDE NOTE: Do this before brushing teeth. better results, and brushes the sticky stuff away.  Do not leave on for mover the 1 hour, you will feel sensitivity, not pain.</li>
    <li> I love crest strip have been using them several years get loads of complements on how pretty and white my teeth are so I recommend crest white strips alot. My favorite is the professional. Here&#x27;s a hint that helps ALOT dry brush your teeth before applying strip.(wet your brush but nothing else).</li>
    <li> It works okay, even if your teeth feel sore it is just for a couple of days keep using it till finished, and you will see results.</li>
    <li> They were shipped on time and the product works great. I am already seeing results and I&#x27;ve only been using it for almost two weeks now.</li>
    <li> No sensitivity issues yet and I am prone to sensitivity. I have used one 1-hour treatment, skipped a day, and then have done the 30-minute treatments two days in a row. Combined with a new toothpaste (Squigle Tooth Builder) I have already noticed an increase in the evenness and whiteness of the color of my teeth after 4 days. I have only used Crest Whitestrips once in the past, and the strips with Advanced Seal are remarkable. If you take the time to apply these well, I promise you they will not come off or even peel a bit. They are a bit tough to remove, but I would prefer that over having them fall off. My only negative comment is a personal issue... the texture of these if I touch my teeth front together is worse than nails on a chalkboard to me.</li>
    <li> After just one use, my teeth are almost electric white. At least in my mind. I&#x27;ve been a coffee drinker for years, and I have previously whitened with professional whitener but this clearly works just as well with MUCH less hassle, time or money. I used one half-hour treatment. I recommend being very careful positioning the strips to not touch the gum line much because they won&#x27;t budge once applied. That&#x27;s actually part of their charm. Also, be prepared to spit once or twice during your 30 minutes because these produce a lot of mouth foam. Not pleasant but necessary. If you&#x27;re ready for a promotion at work or a renewed love-life, these just may do the trick.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and am most pleased with the results.  I usually use it once a year and feel it really does whiten my teeth quite well.</li>
    <li> I was doubtful that this would work on my teeth, especially after reading some of the comments. My teeth were quite yellow. After the first use I could see a difference. After the 3rd use they were perfectly white. It is noticeable enough that even my husband noticed ;). I love this product. There was some gum sensitivity after the 3rd use but it did not last long. I will continue to purchase this item. It is worth the price!</li>
    <li> Good effect. Smile and do not hesitate!</li>
    <li> I was thinking of getting my teeth professionally whitened, until I found out about these. People can see the noticiable difference in my teeth within days. I use to have very dull yellow teeth, now I get compliments on them. They do make some of my teeth feel a bit sensitive though. It says to use everyday, but I think it&#x27;s better to skip a few days &amp; keep using until you get your desired white teeth. Save a few to whiten a couple times in the future to maintain them. I usually buy a new box each year. It&#x27;s affordable, it works.</li>
    <li> These definitely whitened my teeth, not significantly, but noticeably enough. Unfortunately, the extreme sensitivity they caused made it completely not worth it! I read the reviews before purchasing the product and followed the advice of others with sensitivity issues. I skipped a couple of days in between applications and made sure to follow the directions on the box. This product made my teeth so sensitive one day that I had to take pain medication and lay down. I could not finish using the product. Overall, would not recommend to anyone with tooth sensitivity!</li>
    <li> White strips are always the best</li>
    <li> May 20 2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These strips works really well. Removed coffee stained teeth after two applications.</li>
    <li> No results after using strips.  Teeth are sensitive and shown little to no improvement on actually doing what its suppose to do.  I&#x27;m very disappointed in the product pretty much threw my money away on this one.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best whitening system I have used. I used the old Crest white strips and did not like them at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Noticeably whiter teeth (received numerous compliments!)&lt;br /&gt;Stick to your teeth and do not move&lt;br /&gt;May or may not get you the girl of your dreams&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
    <li> These work well. Would have liked to have a couple more 1 hour strips but, they really aren&#x27;t needed. I continue to see great results from the 30 min. Strips. I like to whiten all of the top row and all of the bottom so I use 4 strip total 2 upper and two lower. They overlap, but only in the front. I think this gives a more natural look. Whitening just the front leaves the other teeth looking twice as dingy or more off color  than they really are.</li>
    <li> all I can say is my wife love these strips , Her teeth are awesome they really work to mantain your teeth inbetween visits and shes been useing them for at least 10 years</li>
    <li> My job requires me to be in the public eye SOO it&#x27;s important to me to have white teeth when I engage in conversation with them.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic, but I&#x27;m convinced!  Much easier to use than those expensive plastic tube things you have to boil to get into the right shape. After using it for a few consecutive days, my teeth turned from slightly yellow to almost white. Much much better than those cheap whitening toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is a little expensive. For a cheaper option, I tried the following paste gel for whitening and it works wonders too. Recommend!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RH1TRE/ref&#x3D;as_li_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B000RH1TRE&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;tag&#x3D;hocivfd-20</li>
    <li> Easy to put on teeth. Not taste, a bit foamy but not to much that you need to spit. Whitens great. Only thing when the time period is up and the strips are removed, a bit of gunk in mouth. Quick rinse you are ready to start the day. Very pleased with outcome.</li>
    <li> subtle changes in my smile. but definitely whiter then when I started. Will continue to use. This product did cause some mild sensitivity but nothing that was unbearable. I used it every other day or prevent this. ^_^</li>
    <li> It works . I love it. I am happy.</li>
    <li> It worked but doesnt whiten so much&lt;br /&gt;If you want something natural and u r on low budget this is for u</li>
    <li> Great results within one week and sinve i bought when on sale i couldnt go wrong with trying this wonderful product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a person. They seem to have worked well alongside the polishing paste, toothpaste, and whitening mouthwas</li>
    <li> I really love this product . But the problem is the price and the city , because I can&#x27;t  order it from Spain amazoons that&#x27;s why I have to pay much money than other people .</li>
    <li> Keeps my teeth white! Though I did minimize the amount of coffee and tea I drank. But it does the job.  Sometimes I get some tooth sensitivity but I think that&#x27;s fairly normal.  Anything extreme I&#x27;d probably stop.</li>
    <li> These really hurt my teeth and make them so sensitive. I even spread out the treatment to every few days so it would not be too much for my teeh but still my teeth would hurt for a full day after using the strips.  I have stopped using them after just a few applications and will not go back to the treatment.</li>
    <li> I live that the one hour strips are included to boost initial results!</li>
    <li> love that it comes with a couple one hour quick whitening strips.....then also the other regular 30 min strips....good for those special occasions.</li>
    <li> Love the white strips. Had results in a week that were visible and they stay on your teeth and don&#x27;t slip off like other brands. I recommend to buy!</li>
    <li> Easy to put on and seems to whiten as it says, I would and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I got my whiter smile! Thank you!</li>
    <li> These do work, I got them on sale during the holidays.</li>
    <li> I got the 20 treatments box which also includes two 1 hour Express treatments. I also checked that the date was still good, so it was not expired. It is true that it sticks pretty well to teeth (unless they are crooked ) and it does not damage your gums if it happens to touch them, but it does NOT bleach teeth or make them any whiter. I used the 1 hour Express first, following all the instructions. I wonder why so many people wrote great reviews. I guess the whitening depends on what kind of stains your teeth have or why they are yellowish. My teeth got yellow because of coffee and sodas. This product didn&#x27;t work for me. I even did the bottom teeth first, so I could compare the final result to the top teeth. It was very poor. I had to check very close and for a few minutes before I could see a slight difference. I would suggest anyone who wants to try it, to get it on sale or at a discount price. If it works for you, then that&#x27;s great; but if you re like me and Crest 3D White does nothing for you, then you will not feel so bad.</li>
    <li> These strips are very good and although they do not go all the way to the back teeth they get the job done. I have been using them for more than a month and I see results. I can even go out and no one notices them. Finally, they are comfortable.</li>
    <li> I bought this when it was on sale (around $35) and it&#x27;s a great product. I saw a change on the first use of the strips. The results are great. I drink coffee but only 2-4 times a month. I use it probably 3-5 times a week because I want to give my teeth a break sometimes. The first week after doing it 3 times in a row, I did feel a little pain so I took a break the following day. I resumed after that and it felt fine. Other than that, I usually don&#x27;t feel any pain at all.</li>
    <li> I think it improved my teeth by about two shades of white. I as well had some issues with teeth sensitivity (though this problem is not unique to this brand), but it was fine after I switched to using Sensodyne while using the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May use again in the future and would recommend.</li>
    <li> After the first few strips were used, I had a lot of uneven whitening (ie: I had bright white spots scattered all over). With continued use, the whitening became more even. Though with continued use my teeth became incredibly sensitive. Once I completed the box, my teeth were quite white and that was pleasing, however, my teeth remained sensitive for a good month afterward. I doubt I will ever purchase again.</li>
    <li> I bought the pack that had two additional one hour express stripes with it. While it did make my teeth hurt a little, it wasn&#x27;t as much as I&#x27;ve had them hurt with other crest products. After just one of the one hour express stripes, my coworker mentioned that my teeth looked whiter, without me even mentioning them. Overall they worked very well, but I use them every other day to reduce the chances of tooth sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The enamel on my teeth is thinner and makes them more sensitive to suffering from pain after using such products. If this sounds like you, I would suggest using a toothpaste and mouthwash with added fluoride for a few weeks before starting any whitening stripes or use the ones developed for sensitive teeth (although I don&#x27;t believe they give the whitest results).</li>
    <li> Seemed to slightly whiten my teeth, but nothing shocking. I sometimes have sensitive teeth, but didn&#x27;t experience any sensitivity with this product.</li>
    <li> i love this product, its easy and convenient.. isn&#x27;t messy like the mouth trays. i have only used it for about 1 week, but see slight results already.</li>
    <li> I opened the box and saw that I was actually given 3 &amp;#34;1 Hour Express&amp;#34; Treatments and 17 &amp;#34;30 Minute&amp;#34; Treatments. Not complaining though :)</li>
    <li> Crest makes the best white strips on the market in my opinion, and these are quite good.  Unfortunately I believe I will have to stop using them due to tooth sensitivity - most whitening products make it worse.  Perhaps they&#x27;ll come up with a good alternative.</li>
    <li> I love these white strips. My teeth are sensitive from all the years of whitening, but they didn&#x27;t hurt from using these strips.</li>
    <li> These work very well if you follow the directions and use them daily for 30 minutes.  The first night, I applied them and then went to bed.  This was a big no-no as my teeth ached the entire next day.  After I recovered from my mistake, I tried them again for only 30 minutes at a time (as directed) and got great results and no sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Works better than as I ever imagined. It has made my teeth a lot whiter... well, actually completely white. It may cause some teeth sensitivity, it did a few times, but nothing you can&#x27;t survive and it will pass. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest Whitestrips before on two occassions.  I cannot remember exactly which version it was, but each time I used them, others noticed that my teeth were whiter and often asked about it.  The change is gradual so you cannot always understand how much whiter your teeth are getting unless you take a before and after picture under similar light.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you will notice the change but you will not understand how many shades your teeth have changed until you see people that haven&#x27;t seen you for 5-7 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is even more amazing than the ones I&#x27;ve tried due to the &#x27;express&#x27; treatment.  You&#x27;ll notice changes much faster with it.  It seems that home treatment is getting much closer to dental office treatment when it comes to teeth whitening.  Sadly, if I have used these types of products before, the brightening changes may only last months (and not years).  Anyway, this product is more convenient than going to the dentist.  Plus it is cheaper and maybe less painful.  And yes, it is very easy to use.  Just follow the instructions included.</li>
    <li> These will whiten your teeth a bit.  Please read the warnings on the box as it can irritate the gums.  It did a little bit for me but it wasn&#x27;t a real problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They feel a little like wearing packing tape on your teeth which is weird.</li>
    <li> I typically use \\&quot;strips\\&quot; to remove stains between my professional dental cleanings. As a Pacific Northwestern, I drink a lot of coffee. Seriously, a *lot*. I love it. Until I can get my caffeine via IV, my teeth will continue to require a bit of whitening now and then. That&#x27;s where Crest 3D comes in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to go a little off road in how I apply white strips. Here&#x27;s how to use Crest 3D if you&#x27;re a coffee drinker and just want to keep the coffee stains at bay: Apply the strips once a day for three days every three months. (A word of caution: They do tend to make your teeth a bit sensitive. I like to do the treatment right before I go to bed, so my teeth feel markedly less sensitive in the morning...when I resume my coffee consumption with zeal!)</li>
    <li> Bought these 3 months before my wedding. In the few weeks I&#x27;ve had it, it&#x27;s like I had my teeth professionally whitened and I&#x27;m not even finished with the box yet!! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> my teeth got whitened significantly after the third use! I love this product! people said it hurts your teeth, so i wouldn&#x27;t dare to use it everyday. My way: use it every other day. i have nothing much to say about this, this is a great product!</li>
    <li> This product really works.</li>
    <li> It is Excellent, I received on time and the quality is great work as It’s required and I will give 5 stars, it’s just Wonderful, better impossible, I was checking many different and similar of this one and I couldn’t find someone like this.</li>
    <li> Picked these up on a lightning deal.  Ive been using these for years, they do a good job.  I have sensitive teeth, so I use them about half of what they say to do and they still do a great job!</li>
    <li> I have been using these for several years (except I just took a break from them for about 2 years).  They are amazing and make a huge difference.  I&#x27;m always being asked how I keep my teeth so white.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how strong these whitening strips are until I put them on myself. I have used Crest before and never encountered sensitivity. I do brush about twice a day. The thing about these is that they begin to start hurting my teeth about 3 hours in, and the pain is pulsing/throbbing on and off for about 8 hours and it moves between different teeth. I&#x27;ve only done 4 installments so far, because of my super sensitive teeth, but the effect is very noticeable, even for that much. I may have to get my teeth professionally whitened, but if you can handle it, these are great :) Just not the best for me.</li>
    <li> When I tried, it discoloured my teeth in a strange way... I saw small cracks on my teeth so I will not use it again. However I would recommend the seller, as I got what I ordered and the product arrived in time with a good quality.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product -- I buy two or three of these 3D strips per year.  In short,  they do the job.</li>
    <li> I bought Crest Whitestrips a few years ago. They sat in my medicine cabinet for well over a year before I finally threw them away. Frankly, I was scared to use them. I was afraid they would make my teeth hurt. I was afraid that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get the strips off my teeth. I was afraid. I have caps on my upper front teeth and I&#x27;m a coffee and red wine drinker. So my bottom teeth were very noticeably darker than my top teeth. After talking to my dentist and reading the reviews, I decided to try again. And I&#x27;m glad I did. Since I only need to lighten my bottom teeth, I am able to cut the top strip in half and get three treatments out of one packet. I&#x27;ve used up 3 packets for a total of 9 treatments and my bottom teeth are already the same shade as my caps. I also use the Crest 3D toothpaste and mouthwash. The strips didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive. I have to say, however, that I don&#x27;t keep the strips on any longer than the prescribed 30 minutes. Nor do I have any difficulty in removing the strips. Yay! I will definitely use these strips again if my teeth look stained.</li>
    <li> This product works.  That&#x27;s really all there is to say.  It is definitely a bit expensive at $40+, but a white smile is pretty priceless in my opinion.  Literally everyone you interact with on a daily basis notices the color of your teeth, so why not make them nice and white?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will say is that my teeth become very sensitive the day after using these strips, to the point that I do not want to use the product again for another 2-3 days (it recommends using it once per day -- no thanks, my teeth would fall off!).  Just take it slow and you&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
    <li> I swear by these whitest rips and am an avid coffee drinker, but you&#x27;d never tell by my bright white smile. They also don&#x27;t cause me to have too much sensitivity unless I lose track of time and wear them for longer than intended. They arrived SUPER quick and in great condition. The 1-hour treatment was awesome!</li>
    <li> Good product. you can see the results within 10 days.</li>
    <li> Not a miracle but work pretty well.</li>
    <li> I love these. They produced great results and fast.&lt;br /&gt;Additional note, you can read reviews for products like this until you&#x27;re blue in the face, but the fact of the matter is products like this are going to work differently for everyone. Not all teeth are created equal. That being said, I would definitely recommend at least giving these a shot!</li>
    <li> Noticeable shade difference that was remarked by all who noticed.</li>
    <li> I had my teeth professionally whitened over 2 years ago. I use these White Strips as a jump start when I think it&#x27;s time to brighten the original work. It seems to work ok. I don&#x27;t know how good it would be without that original dental process though. Maybe I could have saved $500!</li>
    <li> Worked!!! My teeth look great!</li>
    <li> These are newly designed whitening strips... The old style used to slide around your teeth as the worked, these really stay in place and do the fantastic job.  In fact, you almost have to pull/peel the off your teeth like tape they attach so well...</li>
    <li> It definitely works. The strips are a little difficult to remove, they stick like glue.</li>
    <li> However, for those with sensitive teeth, it will be a little uncomfortable if you use them daily.  I have sensitive teeth and usually need to take a \\&quot;day off\\&quot; every third day.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel my teeth changed as much as their advertisement made it seem.</li>
    <li> Great convenience having delivered on a monthly basis!</li>
    <li> These are my favorite of any of the over the counter products. These strips stay put!!! Not like some of the other brands and for me its worth the extra cost! I saw a difference in my teeth from 1 use. I I do get tooth sensitivity so I make sure to have some Sensodyne on hand and may go every other day. I shopped around and Amazon had the best price with a coupon they were $32.00- not bad at all. Great product, give it a try and I think you will like them!</li>
    <li> Great seller! Prompt service! Everything is perfect! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I have used the whitening strips on and off for about  five years and find them very good for maintaining the degree of white that was accomplished by some other means. In may case it was [[ASIN:B004IUNPBO Easy Smile - Kit Tooth Whitening -Led Light + 20 Cc Peroxide Carbamide 35% + Remineralization Gel 3cc +2 Trays-Made in Usa-]]. I see it now comes in a 44% strength as well, but since the 35% started to to tingle very strong, I do not want to try anything stronger. The strips are hydrogen peroxide compared to carbamide peroxide with the gels, but they do not state the percentage strength. Based on my experience I would place it close to 10%. Since there is hardly any obious change after using the strips compared to the gel I would plan on using the gel every six months and the strips on a monthly basis. This kit now introduces the two hour strips which theoretically work better, but you should not use it often. While better they still do not equal the gels and trays. Finally the stickiness of the strips is excellent. Which is a good thing because the size is such that while they cover the front of upper and lower teeth, there is barely enough to wrap around the tooth. Your tongue naturally gravitates toward that seam/edge, and if it was not for the strong glue, the strip would be peeled of way before the 30 minutes were up. In summary, excellent maintenence product, the two hour strip intend to approximate the stronger gels, but do not quite make it all the way there. Best of its type product that I have tried, no increased tooth sensitivity.</li>
    <li> worked way  better then I  ever  expected. !!</li>
    <li> Would recommend to everyone!! My teeth looked professionally done and didn&#x27;t have any sensitivity problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried these before and never really been blown away. I&#x27;m still not getting the kind of results I&#x27;d expect but...maybe it&#x27;s just my teeth. I know most people love them so it&#x27;s definitely worth a shot. They lighten discoloration from coffee and tea drinking. I didn&#x27;t have any discomfort using the 1/2 hour strips, but did have some aching from the 2 hour ones.</li>
    <li> If you want truly white teeth, then get it professionally done.  But if you want a pick up from those everyday stains like tea and coffee, then this will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first two days, I used the two hour strips.  Then each day I used the 30 minute treatment.  Were my teeth brighter, yes.  Were they truly white, no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are they easy to use, well, they tend to slip over the period but you can control it. Overall, it is a good but not great product.  And it is definitely as good as if not better than other whitening products.</li>
    <li> Really liked it and it worked. But be AWARE that the 2 extra 1 hour professional effects work really well, but I had tooth and gum pain/ discumfort for HALF a day ... so it works but be prepare to suffer!</li>
    <li> bonus hour whitening strips are VERY EFFECTIVE! BUT the price keeps going up...not pleased about that!</li>
    <li> Husband smoked cigarettes for 8 years and he had a yellow tint on his teeth.  He didn&#x27;t notice how yellow his teeth were until he looked at his graduation photos and he refused to buy them to send to family.  I told him I could put white-out on the photo:)) he didn&#x27;t think it was a funny as I did, and shortly after that he purchased this.  I&#x27;m blown away how white his teeth are becoming.</li>
    <li> This is my second box, was refunded for the first one. My teeth are a little whiter but could have attained a better whitening if I paid the $150.00 at aspen dental for a zoom whitening treatment in half of the time.</li>
    <li> I hope this review helps you. I always depend on reviews when I shop. I have used the &amp;#34;non professional&amp;#34; strips a few times in the past, and they are okay. But these things are great. The others were thin and flimsy and hard to get on my teeth and hard to keep in place when talking. Not these. They have more body to them. They keep the cleaning agent in place longer. They stay where they belong even when talking. And they whiten. I mean they really whiten. Maybe it is because they stay in place longer. But I will never use the others again.</li>
    <li> All I can say is Awesome! Neither my teeth or gums hurt! And what a difference. As reference this is after 1 use of the 1 hour express. I have no used the normal strips AT ALL yet. The lighting is a little different between the pictures, but still what a difference!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! I once paid a lot of money to have the professional ZOOM whitening done at my dentist office and I have to say, these Crest 3D strips to just as good a job.&lt;br /&gt;You do need to use the Professional Version,as the others don&#x27;t do a great job. My teeth are usually pretty white (I don&#x27;t drink coffee, smoke, etc), but these white strips do an awesome job at making them even brighter.</li>
    <li> I bought the product after a friend recommended it, at first i wasn&#x27;t quite confident it will work but after the third day I started noticing an improvement in the whiteness of my teeth. I still have a week of treatment to go and the results are really great, haven&#x27;t suffered from sensitivity issues and followed the tip of not washing my teeth at least an hour before applying the product.</li>
    <li> I only have to use these 3 times every couple months. These work GREAT!</li>
    <li> These whitening strips DO work, but it takes awhile.  My husband used 2 full boxes before we noticed a difference....but we have them on auto-delivery and would not think of cancelling!</li>
    <li> Three uses of the strips and I have seen initial results. Great product.</li>
    <li> Truly works perfectly. No complaints. Just what you want from a whitener.</li>
    <li> I have used Crest Strips for years.  I always get compliments on how white my teeth look. Be careful to follow instructions so you don&#x27;t harm your enamel.  I maintain my &amp;#34;white teeth&amp;#34; using thes strips 1 to 2x a week.</li>
    <li> These work great! With only 5 treatments my teeth are super white. I&#x27;m going to hang on to the extras and maybe use them in another 6 months or go to once a week for maintenance. I had mild tooth sensitivity but nothing unbearable and I did 5 consecutive days. I have already recommended it to friends and you should totally try it!!!</li>
    <li> The thing I found interesting about this product was it made my teeth look whiter because it gave me the urge to go out in the sun as soon as I used one so I got really really really tan there for making my teeth look whiter even if they weren&#x27;t. But my muscles got way way way bigger since I started using this product and all the hot chicks really really really dig my bod. I have also not had any car problems since I started using this product saving lots of time and money. So I would say get ya self some of dis stuff dude.</li>
    <li> I drink tea every day, so I find that after a year or so, my teeth start to lose a bit of their whiteness. Using one of the Crest 3D products brings back some of the bright. This was my first time using the 2 hour Express version first, and I found it worked really well to give my teeth a noticeable boost in whiteness in just a few days without causing the tooth pain I&#x27;ve experienced with some of the other more intense versions of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For regular whitening, I like the normal 30 minute strips the best. They work well with my lifestyle and don&#x27;t cause tooth pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had what I consider \\&quot;dazzling\\&quot; results with any of these kits, but they do seem to remove stains and brighten up my smile to the point that I see the difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been whitening my teeth for at least 8 years with various versions of Crest White Strips and also through the use of a custom tray made by my dentist. I&#x27;ve always been pleased with the results from Crest&#x27;s products - but even more so since the products in recent years have included an adhesive which keeps the strips from sliding around. I&#x27;ve used the 3D strips before with good results - typically 2 or 3 days worth of applications will give me a nice touch up boost, but this was my first time trying the two-hour express which provided slightly better results as a touch up in a much shorter period of time. Of note- I did notice some gum sensitivity around the one hour mark (using the two-hour express strips) which went away after a few moments. I&#x27;ve noticed sometimes after using whitening strips that a few hours later I&#x27;ll experience a small amount of sensitivity but nothing unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;05/14 Update - there was more sensitivity (about 24 hours worth) after using a two-hour strip. I recommend saving those for really special occasions if you are prone to sensitivity with whitening products such as this.</li>
    <li> Works great didn&#x27;t have any sensitivity issues</li>
    <li> Worked amazingly well!! My teeth look amazing and only a tiny bit of sensitivity. Nothing I couldn&#x27;t handle.</li>
    <li> Great; last a whole year. My dentist asked where I get my teeth whitened and I doesn&#x27;t believe I only use strips. She thinks I&#x27;m &#x27;cheating&#x27; on her. : -)</li>
    <li> These things are great! Came with the 2 hour treatment to get you going and then continue with the daily treatments. Great!</li>
    <li> Worked as described.  Would recommend for a friend to use.</li>
    <li> The one hour strips were much more effective than the regulars</li>
    <li> Really works!&lt;br /&gt;I have had my teeth whitened at the detest in the past.  I like to use these as a ere-whitener and they never let me down.&lt;br /&gt;Really easy to apply and you forget they are in after awhile.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended, but don&#x27;t use it everyday, I used only 6 and I found the difference</li>
    <li> I love this product. Its my second time using it and the result is great!</li>
    <li> Problem #1: The strips dont cover your whole teeth. If you want to have parts of your teeth white, and other parts, splotchy that are yellow then this kit is for you. The crevices of your teeth simply wont get whitened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem #2: The peroxide in this is STRONG. your teeth will be extremely sensitive, and if you get any on your gums (tip: you will!) , then your gums will get burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And last but not least problem #3, this kit is 52$ at the time of writing. Pricey!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you bought this kit and had the same problems that I described, then you might like to know of a different kit that uses a tray &amp; gel system that doesnt have these same issues. I used it myself and can gladly say that it works better, with no burning sensations that crest has, for a lower price. [[ASIN:B00PWSAXAM Shine Whitening - Zero Peroxide Teeth Whitening System - No Sensitivity]] is sold right here on amazon. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Works well. Only issue I had was sore teeth after the express whitening and occasionally after applying a normal strip</li>
    <li> I love these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used them for the instructed time and my teeth came up a few shades lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did experience a bit of pain by the 3rd day of use, which I know is normal, so I backed the use down and skipped some days. The pain eased and I carried on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how these compare to the professional job done by a dentist, but they worked great for me and I wouldn&#x27;t really want my teeth any whiter. It just looks fake if you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful not to eat or drink dark foods before or after use and don&#x27;t brush right afterwards or it will hurt!</li>
    <li> Teeth whitening worked great.  Saw results within 1 week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Whitening Strips for as long as I can remember and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.  I&#x27;ve also paid for professional whitening treatments and I think that the Crest strips work just as well, although they take longer to achieve the desired effect.  Still, the cost is much, much lower than what you&#x27;d expect to pay to a professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit consists of 2 products.  You receive a couple of 2 hour \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; treatments that will give your teeth a whiter look in only 2 hours.  No, the effect isn&#x27;t as impressive as what you&#x27;ll achieve by using the daily strips, but it will indeed give you a quick, easy and noticeable improvement in whiteness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other strips are worn daily and will give you a beautiful white look once the treatments are done.  This particular white strips adhere to your teeth much, much better than older Crest White Strips versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an outstanding product.  Not cheap, but cheap compared to what you&#x27;d pay a dentist to do essentially the same thing.  5 stars.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, it does what I expected and I am happy with the quality of the results. Definitely I recommend it and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have used these many times but bought them on amazon due to having a coupon. I love the way they stay on your teeth vs the other brand sliding around and off. You can even talk with these on. Love them.</li>
    <li> Crest Whitestrips (all varieties) are expensive - and while they do work in some cases, they don&#x27;t work on all types of stains, and they&#x27;re pretty well worthless if your teeth are anything short of straight - and my teeth, unfortunately, are not straight. On top of all this, they cause sensitivity in a lot of people, including me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I use Plus White Gel (http://amzn.to/19pkHOG) with a moldable mouthpiece and have had way better results.</li>
    <li> I think the thing to remember with whitening strips is the fact that your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My usage:&lt;br /&gt;I used these about two to three times a week for at least thirty minutes each time.  The instructions do not state how many times a week they should be used only that they should stay on the teeth for at least thirty minutes.  Due to the side-effect of sensitive teeth, I was only able to tolerate using them for two to three times a week.  I did go through all the white strips before posting this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do they work?&lt;br /&gt;Somewhat.  It&#x27;s hard to tell...I think my teeth got a little bit whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What about the side-effects?&lt;br /&gt;You mean did my gums get sensitive and hurt?  Yes.  Oh, yes.  The other reviewers were not kidding around about that.  As the solution on top of the white strips gets inside my gums during usage, they definitely jolted my nerves.  It made me cringe every single time the solution hit the nerves inside the gums.  The sensitivity does not appear until hours later, sometimes when I woke up after using them last night.  There would be a constant sensitivity even when not drinking or eating.  Very, very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What about the taste?&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re horrible.  I don&#x27;t know how to describe it, but it kind of reminded me of stale saliva.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I use them again?&lt;br /&gt;No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend them to others?&lt;br /&gt;No.  Save your money and save yourself from possible pain.  Just brush your teeth thoroughly two to three times a day and the results will be similar.</li>
