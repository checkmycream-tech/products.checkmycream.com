      <li>My hair came out great.</li>
      <li>And the smell is amazing!  </li>
      <li>The feeling of lightness is remarkable.  </li>
      <li>I have always liked Aussie hair products; this one is no exception!  </li>
      <li>conditioner is good for all the reasons they state on the packaging...</li>
      <li>These guys know how to make a good hair product at an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product for a good price.</li>
      <li>Okay, so it didn&#x27;t solve all the world&#x27;s problems, but it did solve just a couple of ours!  </li>
      <li>I LOVE the pina colada aroma!</li>
      <li>It smells great, the shampoo lathers well, and my hair feels fantastic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad to see that it&#x27;s still a good, inexpensive product.  </li>
      <li>but this really did a great job!</li>
      <li>/&gt;This has good nostalgia value--it&#x27;s the Aussie you know and love if you bought this line in the nineties.</li>
      <li>and she was thrilled with the product.</li>
      <li>With a pleasant scent, the conditioner goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>Also, it has a light, pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>They are cheap and good.  </li>
      <li>the Sleeker the Butter Smoothing Conditioner, seems to do a slightly better job.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Aussie has always been my favorite line of drugstore hair products.</li>
      <li>, first off, the scent of this conditioner was quite nice!  </li>
      <li>I love these Aussie products and it has nothing to do with their cute mascot.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner is definitely more suited to dryer, thicker hair.  </li>
      <li>I also love the scent, smells so clean and nice.  </li>
      <li>and she had a healthy and smooth look to hair</li>
      <li>The bottle opens and closes easily, without straining the hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Aussie conditioner has the bright, vibrant scent that I associate with all Aussie products, with even a hint of coconut.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair was not tangled and easy to brush</li>
      <li>It rinses out easily.</li>
      <li>liked the volume this product added, and will certainly buy it again.</li>
      <li>Which is fabulous considering the 24/7 furnace usage that wrecks havic to our hair and skin.</li>
      <li>Add-On Item, which means you have to spend $25 to get free shipping.</li>
      <li>Aussie Total Miracle is great.</li>
      <li>My hair is smooth and manageable.</li>
      <li>When used with the Total Miracle shampoo, this conditioner makes my hair look and feel great.  </li>
      <li>It has a light coconut scent that smells like summer.  </li>
      <li>The scent was light and not overpowering.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Scent tends to be pretty subjective, but it seemed to smell a bit like a pina colada, sweet and kind of fruity.  </li>
      <li>I used the original Aussie Three Minute Miracle for years.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this product; and for me personally, the biggest surprise was the coconut scent which I love!</li>
      <li>Aussie Total Miracle 7 N 1 was a pleasant surprise.</li>
      <li>We both agreed that the Aussie Total Miracle Collection is a superior experience in hair conditioners.  </li>
      <li>Aussie Total Miracle Collection 7 in 1 Conditioner is a perfectly good conditioner, but I was by no means wowed by its miraculousness.  </li>
      <li>She has straight hair that tends to get fly-aways and static in the winter, and this conditioner helped with that.  </li>
      <li>Aussie Total Miracle Collection 7N1 conditioner is a good conditioner.</li>
      <li>Like a sweet coconut, and</li>
      <li>For $3.50 not a bad deal.</li>
      <li>(I turn shampoo and conditioner bottles upside-down in the shower when they start running low to get the most out of the product; I can&#x27;t stand when manufacturers make the top rounded so that the bottles won&#x27;t balance upside-down!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fantastic thank you very much</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice enough scent, but I miss the original Aussie scent.  </li>
      <li>mostly it makes my hair feel and smell great and this package will last me in excess of 6 months (short hair).  </li>
      <li>This is my new favorite conditioner for winter.</li>
      <li>Seriously too, if you love when your hair smells great but not crazy overpowering - try this.</li>
      <li>The clean feel is very much welcome!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap but works really well.  </li>
      <li>the title &amp;#34;Miracle&amp;#34; does actually seem to fit it well.  :-)</li>
      <li>Right now, I have short hair, and it&#x27;s a bit much conditioner, mostly because the dispenser on this bottle puts out more than I&#x27;d like.  </li>
      <li>Please bring back the original scent!!  </li>
      <li>However, our hair seems to actually be more prone to fly-away hairs and static than with the other conditioners we were using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>conditioner is good and in keeping with other Aussie products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;In summary, I have found that this product doesn&#x27;t QUITE meet my needs right now.  </li>
      <li>I read that it smelled like coconut, and right now, when it is February and winter</li>
      <li>The price is right</li>
      <li>have Golden Retriever hair: unprocessed, straight, healthy, more silver than gold.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Aussie Total Miracle Collection 7 in 1 Conditioner is a good conditioner, and it does do what it claims; my hair is soft, silky, and not as frizzy as it would be left to its own devices.  </li>
      <li>The Total Miracle Conditioner is exactly what my hair needs during these times, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, and smells absolutely wonderful.</li>
      <li>She said it moisturized nicely without weighing her hair down, and it rinsed cleanly.  </li>
      <li>Now I need a large pump bottle of this one!</li>
      <li>But, if you&#x27;re gluten-free or sensitive to strong scents, this is not for you.</li>
      <li>This is a great, thick conditioner.  </li>
      <li>At first, it did nothing at all for my hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, we are pleased with the Aussie Total Miracle Conditioner.</li>
      <li>That was my first miracle of the</li>
      <li>Whatever it is, while I didn’t care for it at first, it began to grow on me until I decided it smelled</li>
      <li>It is much more similar to a conditioning treatment rather than</li>
      <li>Redken Solve (no longer available) used to leave my hair as soft.  </li>
      <li>and I like the scent (pretty but not overpowering floral).</li>
      <li>When I rinsed it out the next day, my hair smelled amazing and was very soft.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d call it a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; but it is a good conditioner.</li>
      <li>7 in 1 Conditioner did make my hair feel smoother and softer and controlled the frizz better than simply using shampoo by itself, I don’t feel like it was necessarily more miraculous than any of the other smoothing conditioners out there.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not quite the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; it claims to be, but it certainly does the job.</li>
      <li>This moisturizing conditioner has a sweet coconut scent and leaves hair soft and manageable as any decent conditioner does.</li>
      <li>This stuff is the real deal.</li>
      <li>Like it just as much as Aussie Moist.</li>
      <li>My daughter insisted I edit my review and say how much she LOVES this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>consistency was similar to cheap lotion, but not too watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>Aussie has always offered a solid line for a cheap price.</li>
      <li>Too much.  </li>
      <li>someone who spends a lot of time in the pool, I&#x27;m very conscientious of my hair and taking care of it.</li>
      <li>My daughters have long hair that tends to get tangled easily.</li>
      <li>I had my daughter try this conditioner, since most conditioners tend to make my hair too flat and soft.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought the shampoo and conditioner. At first, it did nothing at all for my hair. No softness or change whatsoever. But towards the end of the shampoo and conditioner bottles, my scalp was painfully dry and extremely itchy. Dandruff like crazy. What a terrible product! Never had anything affect me like this before.</li>
    <li> Really deep conditioner.. wife loves it. Shes used this brand Aussie for a long time now and was excited for it to come in.&lt;br /&gt;Her hair can be &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; at time cuz of straightening and curling and dying/coloring... but this really did a great job!</li>
    <li> I have color-treated thin hair, but lots of hair (I hope this makes sense!). Aussie has always been my favorite line of drugstore hair products. I normally use the Aussie Moist 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner formula [[ASIN:B001F51PRG Aussie Moist 2-In-1 Shampoo 13.5 Fl Oz (Pack of 6)]]....but sometimes I need some extra conditioning. The Total Miracle Conditioner is exactly what my hair needs during these times, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, and smells absolutely wonderful.</li>
    <li> I chose to purchase Aussie Miracle shampoo and conditioner because other Aussie products are family favorites, Aussie is one of the few hair products I’ve seen Paula Begoun recommend, and it was very low priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Condition - After washing with it&#x27;s sister shampoo, I applied a dime-size dollop of conditioner.  Too much.  My hair would have been totally coated with half that amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse - My hair felt soft when rinsed and less coated than it felt after shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry - I used no other hair products.  I blew dry my hair by hanging it upside down.  It dried quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results - Soft, shiny hair.  The feeling of lightness is remarkable.  When I run my hands through my hair, I can’t hardly feel my hair.  Not the least weighted down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argon products made my hair shinier but I quickly developed dermatitis to Argon so rule that one out.  Redken Solve (no longer available) used to leave my hair as soft.  But no other hair product has left my hair feeling as light as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Golden Retriever hair: unprocessed, straight, healthy, more silver than gold.  It will certainly work differently on people with course, curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum:  After 3 months of use I still find that none of my other shampoos leave my hair as soft and light as this one.</li>
    <li> Does what a conditioner should do - conditions your hair.  And it does that well.  It does have a scent.  I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to scents but this one doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d call it a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; but it is a good conditioner.</li>
    <li> We have been using Aussie products for many years and you can usually find the large pump bottles of shampoo and conditioner in each of our bathrooms.  My one daughter has long curly hair that is forever in need of conditioner.  I wanted to try the Aussie Total Miracle Collection 7N1 and see if it could solve all the worlds problems in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;  I was pleasantly surprised at the beachy tropical smell. Ahh...yes, I immediately felt like I was on vacation or a beach on this cold snowy day. I have short hair so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much in the way of help, but I was wrong!  Conditioner normally leaves my hair flat and &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;, but this did not! I had shiny, fluffy hair!  That was my first miracle of the day!&lt;br /&gt;  The second miracle of the day occurred when my daughter tried the 7N1. Remember, she has long curly hair and she was thrilled with the product. Wow. She dried her hair, used her flat iron and she had a healthy and smooth look to hair the entire day!&lt;br /&gt;  Okay, so it didn&#x27;t solve all the world&#x27;s problems, but it did solve just a couple of ours!  I will certainly purchase again in the future!  Now I need a large pump bottle of this one!</li>
    <li> My hair has always been slightly oily, so frizz is not a problem, but the heavy greasy look can be.  I&#x27;m a busy working mom and, if my hair looks decent in the morning, I don&#x27;t always want to take the time to shampoo and style it.  Some shampoo/conditioner products leave me regretting this decision by lunchtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that the Aussie Total Miracle Collection conditioner (and matching shampoo)  leave my hair shiny and soft, but not heavy.  My hair doesn&#x27;t even look oily at the end of the second day, it just looks healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Aussie products back-in-the-day when all my friends used them and I&#x27;m glad to see that it&#x27;s still a good, inexpensive product.  It has a light coconut scent that smells like summer.  I&#x27;m also a fan of the conditioner bottle&#x27;s white cap, which distinguishes this bottle from it&#x27;s purple-capped shampoo twin.</li>
    <li> This moisturizing conditioner has a sweet coconut scent and leaves hair soft and manageable as any decent conditioner does. what I lvoe about this particular one is the scent if you like coconut) and that a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Works great!  My hair is so soft and silky after just a few uses.  It&#x27;s shiny like it&#x27;s never been before, too.  I only have to use a small amount, about the size of a quarter in the palm of my hand.  And the smell is amazing!  Like a sweet coconut, and I can still smell it a few hours after showering.  I would recommend this to anyone and will definitely buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> I have always liked Aussie hair products; this one is no exception!  Here&#x27;s what I like about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Works well for conditioning the hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves the hair feeling soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;- Does not weight it down and make it flat.&lt;br /&gt;- Does not leave the hair feeling greasy or oily.  The clean feel is very much welcome!&lt;br /&gt;- The bottle opens and closes easily, without straining the hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t found anything that I don&#x27;t like about this product yet, so the title &amp;#34;Miracle&amp;#34; does actually seem to fit it well.  :-)</li>
    <li> I used the original Aussie Three Minute Miracle for years. I remember it advertised botanicals. This bottle does not advertise botanicals, but if you read the label, they are in there. The ingredients list aloe, jojoba oil, and ecklonia radiata which is seaweed from Madagascar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shampooed with baby shampoo, then I used this product, rinsed it out, and I didn&#x27;t use anything else. My hair came out great. I have baby-fine blonde hair that tends to frizz. No frizz today! My hair is smooth and manageable. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love these Aussie products and it has nothing to do with their cute mascot.  I have used Aussie products for 10 yrs and this as well as all of their others are superior to other products, especially since they are so affordable.  7 in 1 is just a rename I believe for a conditioner product they have been selling for years, but whatever they want to name it just as long as I can still buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is good for all the reasons they state on the packaging...mostly it makes my hair feel and smell great and this package will last me in excess of 6 months (short hair).  It makes my hair so soft.</li>
    <li> Aussie Total Miracle is great. It smells wonderful. It&#x27;s inexpensive. You only need to use a little bit of it. What&#x27;s not to love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who spends a lot of time in the pool, I&#x27;m very conscientious of my hair and taking care of it. Deep conditioners are expensive and much of the time, it&#x27;s hard to tell if they&#x27;re even better than the regular stuff. I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with a single Aussie product. These guys know how to make a good hair product at an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for new conditioner, look no further. This stuff is the real deal.</li>
    <li> Aussie Total Miracle Collection 7 in 1 Conditioner is a perfectly good conditioner, but I was by no means wowed by its miraculousness.  I buy conditioner specifically to help tame frizzies and to make my hair feel smooth and soft, and I generally go with brands like Herbal Essences or Garnier Fructis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Aussie Total Miracle 7 in 1 Conditioner did make my hair feel smoother and softer and controlled the frizz better than simply using shampoo by itself, I don’t feel like it was necessarily more miraculous than any of the other smoothing conditioners out there.  My conditioner of choice, Herbal Essences the Sleeker the Butter Smoothing Conditioner, seems to do a slightly better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of Aussie Total Miracle Collection was a little different and hard to pin down.  Scent tends to be pretty subjective, but it seemed to smell a bit like a pina colada, sweet and kind of fruity.  Whatever it is, while I didn’t care for it at first, it began to grow on me until I decided it smelled quite good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aussie Total Miracle Collection 7 in 1 Conditioner is a good conditioner, and it does do what it claims; my hair is soft, silky, and not as frizzy as it would be left to its own devices.  While this is a decent conditioner, and I don’t mind using it, it is not quite as good as my preferred conditioner and unlikely to replace it.</li>
    <li> I used this conditioner in both a traditional and nontraditional way.  I slept with it in my hair with a plastic bag over it because I have processed hair.  When I rinsed it out the next day, my hair smelled amazing and was very soft.  It still curled well with an iron.  I would recommend this as a trusted conditioner comparable to Pantene.</li>
    <li> Fantastic thank you very much</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair and I have been looking for a conditioner that will give me some body without leaving residue on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Aussie conditioner has the bright, vibrant scent that I associate with all Aussie products, with even a hint of coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner washed cleanly away, and left my hair a little bouncy, which I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the volume this product added, and will certainly buy it again.</li>
    <li> Aussie Total Miracle 7 N 1 was a pleasant surprise. With it in my possession, I immediately showered and used it in lieu of my regular conditioner. This product put smoothing and silky texture to my hair. Which is fabulous considering the 24/7 furnace usage that wrecks havic to our hair and skin. I&#x27;m pleased with this product; and for me personally, the biggest surprise was the coconut scent which I love!</li>
    <li> My daughters have long hair that tends to get tangled easily. I was anxious to try Aussie Total Miracle Conditioner on their hair to see if it helped. With a pleasant scent, the conditioner goes on smooth. It rinses out easily. Since using Aussie Total Miracle Conditioner our hair is definitely softer, shiny and easy to comb. However, our hair seems to actually be more prone to fly-away hairs and static than with the other conditioners we were using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we are pleased with the Aussie Total Miracle Conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is a great, thick conditioner.  It is much more similar to a conditioning treatment rather than just a conditioner you would use whenever you shampoo.  It is very thick and you don&#x27;t need to much at a time.  I also love the scent, smells so clean and nice.  This is my new favorite conditioner for winter.</li>
    <li> The price is right and I like the scent (pretty but not overpowering floral). I used this at least 3, if not 4 days in a row but it didn&#x27;t fight frizz. My hair was not tangled and easy to brush but the conditioner didn&#x27;t help my dry hair to become silky soft. I think I&#x27;ll stick with my regular conditioner</li>
    <li> I had my daughter try this conditioner, since most conditioners tend to make my hair too flat and soft.  She has straight hair that tends to get fly-aways and static in the winter, and this conditioner helped with that.  She said it moisturized nicely without weighing her hair down, and it rinsed cleanly.  The smell is heavenly - like a fruity tropical drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s going to try the 7N1 shampoo combined with this conditioner, next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited Feb 3:  My daughter insisted I edit my review and say how much she LOVES this conditioner.  Her hair has never looked so nice - no flyaways, no static, and yet it&#x27;s not gloppy and weighed down.  She has gotten compliments on her hair and keeps raving about this conditioner.  After all the $$$$$ we&#x27;ve spent on her hair products over the years, I wish we&#x27;d found this $3.50 conditioner sooner!</li>
    <li> Pros: The scent was light and not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency was similar to cheap lotion, but not too watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I saw no difference.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells great and works great too. Can use like a rinse out conditioner and also as a leave-in, deep conditioner. Makes hair slinky. Recommended for curly, kinky, or fly-away hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner promises soft, moisturized hair, and that&#x27;s what it gave me. This conditioner is definitely more suited to dryer, thicker hair.  I suspect it would weigh lighter hair down too much.  The formula is very thick, and rubbed easily into my hair.  When rinsed off my hair felt soft, sleek, and shiny.  This conditioner doesn&#x27;t do much to tame frizz (though it does moisturize well), I wish it did a bit more in that department.  The scent is a tropical coconut.  It&#x27;s a nice enough scent, but I miss the original Aussie scent.  Please bring back the original scent!!  In any case, final analysis is that this conditioner works well and is well-worth the price.  It&#x27;s not quite the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; it claims to be, but it certainly does the job.</li>
    <li> Aussie Total Miracle Collection 7N1 Conditioner, 12.1 Fluid Ounce is a nicely scented conditioner in a very odd shaped container. This is an Amazon Add-On Item, which means you have to spend $25 to get free shipping. For $3.50 not a bad deal. The container is rather irritating.</li>
    <li> Aussie Total Miracle Collection 7N1 conditioner is a good conditioner. It is thick and creamy. Also, it has a light, pleasant scent. I&#x27;ve used this conditioner a few times now and it always does a good job with my thick, wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this conditioner makes quite a few claims - namely, that it does 7 different things. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t do all 7. I don&#x27;t feel that my hair had a new found &amp;#34;brilliant shine&amp;#34; or a new &amp;#34;silky softness.&amp;#34; However, this product did condition my hair well and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely use Aussie Total Miracle Collection 7N1 conditioner again. It&#x27;s a good product for a good price.</li>
    <li> When used with the Total Miracle shampoo, this conditioner makes my hair look and feel great.  I LOVE the pina colada aroma!</li>
    <li> I admit, one of the main things that attracted me to this conditioner was the scent.  I read that it smelled like coconut, and right now, when it is February and winter is raging outside, I wanted to add a bit of a tropical element into my mornings!  Several other things about this product appealed to me as well, including the generous size and the flat-topped bottle.  (I turn shampoo and conditioner bottles upside-down in the shower when they start running low to get the most out of the product; I can&#x27;t stand when manufacturers make the top rounded so that the bottles won&#x27;t balance upside-down!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, first off, the scent of this conditioner was quite nice!  It definitely made me smile as soon as I opened the top (which, as other reviewers have noted, was actually a bit tough to open for a simple flip-top lid).  Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed that the scent didn&#x27;t seem to linger at all--it was barely present by the time I rinsed out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as conditioning goes, I was a bit disappointed in that area as well.  To be fair, my hair can be somewhat difficult to condition--it&#x27;s fine and thin and also tends towards oily, so it can be easily weighted down, but it also needs a decent enough conditioner to avoid getting tangles and fly-aways.  This Aussie conditioner is nice and thick, yet it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, so that was a definite plus.  However, after using it for about a week, I notice that I&#x27;m not able to comb through my hair as easily after showering, so clearly, it&#x27;s not leaving my hair quite as \\&quot;conditioned\\&quot; as I would like.  Also, my hair has been more flyaway than usual for me, although that could be because of winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I have found that this product doesn&#x27;t QUITE meet my needs right now.  I&#x27;m going to try setting it aside and using it when the weather gets warmer, as it just might not be intense enough for me with the freezing winter weather we&#x27;ve been having in the northeast.  I do think that this is a decent product that might be right for other hair types.is is a decent product that might be right for other hair types.</li>
    <li> Aussie products are great for not drying my hair out.  They are cheap and good.  I have straight hair thin hair that tends to get greasy, and has all kinds of bad looks because it&#x27;s thin.  Aussie shampoo conditioner combo is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is good and in keeping with other Aussie products I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s cheap but works really well.  Right now, I have short hair, and it&#x27;s a bit much conditioner, mostly because the dispenser on this bottle puts out more than I&#x27;d like.  As my hair grows out, it will be perfect.</li>
    <li> Great! Like it just as much as Aussie Moist. I use it for co-washing or conditioning after a shampoo, and sometimes don&#x27;t rinse it all out so it acts as  a leave-in. Good product, staple for me!</li>
    <li> Aussie has always offered a solid line for a cheap price. I know a lot of people who swear by this brand and I also have never been disappointed.    The Miracle shampoo and conditioner is no different. It smells great, the shampoo lathers well, and my hair feels fantastic. The conditioner is thick and creamy, washes out easily and doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down.     Seriously too, if you love when your hair smells great but not crazy overpowering - try this. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty standard version of the Aussie conditioners.  Introduced in the nineties, they were the poor man&#x27;s Paul Mitchell, &amp;#34;awahupi,&amp;#34; scent, and I can remember my college-aged self thinking they were awesome.  However, the scent on this particular version is so strong, that I couldn&#x27;t stand it for more than a few minutes, and I washed it out of my hair again, a few minutes after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a thorough internet search reveals that this line is probably not gluten-free, because of the fragrance.  If you go to the, &amp;#34;Aussie,&amp;#34; site and type in, &amp;#34;gluten,&amp;#34; it says, &amp;#34;search not recognized.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has good nostalgia value--it&#x27;s the Aussie you know and love if you bought this line in the nineties. But, if you&#x27;re gluten-free or sensitive to strong scents, this is not for you.</li>
    <li> I try a lot of conditioners; I use a conditioner frequently and my roommate uses a conditioner daily.  We both agreed that the Aussie Total Miracle Collection is a superior experience in hair conditioners.  Highly recommended.</li>
