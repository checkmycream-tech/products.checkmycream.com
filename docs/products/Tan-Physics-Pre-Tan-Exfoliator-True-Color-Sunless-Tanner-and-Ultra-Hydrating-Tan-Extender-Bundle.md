      <li>It works great for her.</li>
      <li>Im happy</li>
      <li>would not buy it again found over the counter products just as good for a fraction of the price.</li>
      <li>Great product- holds color, if done as directed, looks fantastic!</li>
      <li>Also tanners make my freckles much more noticeable.</li>
      <li>I applied this lightly and evenly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m light to medium skin tone.</li>
      <li>They all fit well together.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money!</li>
      <li>it was ok,not worth the money I paid for it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all right not what I exected</li>
      <li>does exactly what it says, beautiful tan, goes as light or dark as you want with no orange or yellow staining</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sticking with my Fake Bake that works better with great color achievement.</li>
      <li>This product didn&#x27;t hold up you pretty much had to apply all over again after every shower.</li>
      <li>I liked Fake Bake better.</li>
      <li>No one has noticed my &amp;#34;tan.&amp;#34;  I expected far more from this product with the hefty price tag of $104.90 and the reviews it had received.  </li>
      <li>I am fair skinned and tried using the product several days in a row and hardly achieved any color at all.</li>
      <li>disappointed with all the hype on the product....found it  hard to apply and I was applying on my daughter for prom ...not a good color for fair skin people who stay out of the sun.....</li>
      <li>I also like that it has a fresh citrus smell, not the usual chemical smell that accompanies some self-tanners.</li>

<li> I like that this product does not have that awful smell that all the other tanning products have and that there are no harmful chemicals in it.  </li>

    <li> I just didn&#x27;t like it for me. I liked Fake Bake better. They all work about the same and you have to find what works for you. I gave mine to a friend of mine who LOVES Tan Physics. It works great for her.</li>

    <li> I am disappointed in the Tan Physics Pre-Tan Exfoliator, True Color Sunless Tanner, &amp; Ultra-Hydrating Tan Extender Bundle that was rated #1 in sunless tanners and came with a price of $104.99.  I read the directions carefully and then preceded to use the product as directed.  After several weeks I might be 1 or 2 shades darker.  No one has noticed my &amp;#34;tan.&amp;#34;  I expected far more from this product with the hefty price tag of $104.90 and the reviews it had received.  I will finish using the bottles until empty but will never again trust this web site for products I have never used.</li>
