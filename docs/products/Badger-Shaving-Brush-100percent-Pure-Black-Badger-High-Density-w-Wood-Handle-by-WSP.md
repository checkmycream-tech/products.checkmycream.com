<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This shave brush is exactly what I was looking for. The first time I used it, it felt like a pillow on my face. I highly recommend this brush to anyone looking for a good shave brush for a great price.</li>
    <li> Great lather, bristles look fine. BUT plastic finish cracked on the bottom is continues up the sides after 3 months. Advice: DRY it carefully after each use. Used my dad&#x27;s 60 year-old shaving (raccoon) for 25 years with no problem whatsoever (until I left it in a hotel).</li>
    <li> Great buy.  Very happy with my purchase and my shaves are so much better.  Wish i had done this sooner.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Nice brush for the price.  Have used it for several months and have had no shedding and it dries out well.  See no reason to use something more expensive.</li>
    <li> The brush and soap are outstanding.  I have been a brush and soap shaver all my life and this is without a doubt one of the best brushes I have ever owned.  The soap has a pleasant aroma and produces a nice thick lather resulting in a close shave which leaves the skin feeling younger.</li>
    <li> I was worried when i read other reviews that this brush might be small, IT IS NOT SMALL! If if were any larger it would not fit inside my shaving mug. I have been using boars bristle brushes for the last 40 years and I wish I had learned about Badger brushes long ago. This brush holds a LOT of water and it is SOFT. The lather on my beard is thicker and the bubbles smaller. I am using this brush with William&#x27;s shaving soap and a Harry&#x27;s razor and I love it. Shaving is a treat now instead of a chore.</li>
    <li> bought this product for my husband as a christmas present,  he likes it a lot</li>
    <li> The brush is fine, but it broke after about 1 month.  The bristles are glued into the handle but the glue didn&#x27;t hold and the bristles fell out.  I used it daily for about a month and now it is useless unless I can glue it back in.</li>
    <li> This was my first brush and still my current brush. I think the brush is okay. I&#x27;m not real knowledgeable with brushes since I&#x27;m still a novice but in my opinion, this brush performs really well. The break-in period wasn&#x27;t long or difficult. Lathering isn&#x27;t all that bad. I&#x27;m sure I can do better and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my inexperience, the soap, or the brush is to blame so I won&#x27;t give my opinion on that. I like this brush but I&#x27;m curious to see what other brushes out there have to offer.</li>
    <li> Still losing a few strands after a month but otherwise good.</li>
    <li> Great service.. Was a gift and was very well received..</li>
    <li> Works great and has minimal loss of bristles.</li>
    <li> im gentle with it and read directions but after a month bristles are all over my face..I&#x27;m going back to my cheaper one</li>
    <li> I ordered for my brother and he seems very pleased.  He has used for short time therefore not sure of its longevity.</li>
    <li> It did not last very long. Eventually the brush head came off the handle. The handle finish wore off pretty quickly too. The brush hairs do work up a good lather and shaving is much closer and comfortable. If they were a better quality, long lasting items, they would really rock!</li>
    <li> ...but the best is more than ten times as much. I use it as a travel brush. The hair seems to stay put since I have it, I expect the laquer veneer will come off the wooden handle after a while, but we will see. Recommended.</li>
    <li> changing my review - all the bristles came out after 2 months of light use (not everyday) bristles are not as strong as expected either  i guess i can repair it with some monkey glue.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend to replace a synthetic bristle brush and he loves it! The product was exactly as described. There was no strange smell as some reviews had stated and very little shedding at all. Very good quality product especially for the price.</li>
    <li> excellent brush &amp; price</li>
    <li> Excellent brush for the price! Lathers up nicely with minimal hair loss after the first few uses and no badger scent.</li>
    <li> Great product for this price range. Much softer than the (slightly) cheaper one I first bought for my husband.</li>
    <li> Huge difference between this brush and a boar bristle bruah that I had purchased. Lathers quickly and does an awesome job on applying shaving soap to my face.</li>
    <li> Honey badger should have given a cr@p because his happy butt is now in this brush.  Bet he never thought his fur would be used for a shaving brush anymore than I would have thought I&#x27;d be using one of these.  This brush is a quality product.  No shedding and very comfortable.  Holds water well to develop a rich lather and then rinses easily and completely.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a quality brush after using several disappointing brushes. I&#x27;ve had this brush for a couple of months. So far I&#x27;ve only noticed loosing one hair. I think this brush will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 6 months now, and it works great. Very good quality, and nice looks.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush for the price! Works up a good lather. Got to keep this away from my dachshund--loves the badger hair, lol</li>
    <li> I use it to apply lubricant to my AR rifle. Just a few drops and spreads thin and evenly. Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> very nice! I like it better than my Men-u because it&#x27;s thicker/ fuller. Does not loose many hairs like I hear some brushes do.</li>
    <li> This brush has been very satisfactory for the price.  Badger bristle brushes can get very expensive, so I&#x27;m not surprised that the quantity of bristles on this brush is just a little on the skimpy size, but my husband needed a good travel brush for his go bag, and this meets the need quite well.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush. But I ended up buying a better one</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shaving Brush for over 2 months.  Some shedding of Bristles for the first couple of weeks which is expected.  Shave 5 days a week and so far it has held up fine.  Can&#x27;t beat it for the Price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for over a month now and I love it! Never mind the price point this is just a good quality brush. You&#x27;d be a fool to spend more on other brushes.</li>
    <li> I have always hated shaving, so I decided about 10 years or so ago to try the soap and brush thing just to make it interesting. Problem is, I bought cheap ($8.00 or so) brushes from pharmacies, and I would always end up with a few bristles stuck to my face and that doesn&#x27;t feel good. To the defense of the brushes, I wasn&#x27;t storing them right, as I was leaving them sitting with the bristles down in the mug with the soap, which causes bristle loss. I read up on the subject of shaving with a brush and realized I should buy a higher quality brush and get a stand so the brush can sit up side-down to make sure the bristles dried right. I like the feel of this brush and haven&#x27;t experienced any bristle loss so far (one month). Doesn&#x27;t make me love shaving, but it makes it a little more tolerable..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not expensive, it&#x27;s well made and it lathers nicely.  It didn&#x27;t stink in the first uses.  It fits in my perfecto razor/brush stand nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have complained of the handle cracking or the knot falling out.  It&#x27;s incredibly important to take care of any natural hair brush.  Rinse thoroughly and dry UPSIDE DOWN.  If you don&#x27;t, water pools in the handle and will start to ruin the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take care of this fine WSP brush and it will deliver years of great service to you.  Great great value.</li>
    <li> Brush has not lost a hair!!  Very good for the cost.  Use it everyday.</li>
    <li> This is a decent brush. I am not thrilled with it. It isn&#x27;t as soft as I would have liked but it does soap lather very quickly. After about 2 months of use, the hairs are sticking every which way, despite combing and maintenance. At first it smelled like badger but after 2 or so uses (and I am certain you can wash it out too with soap and water) it was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a starter brush it is great. It is easy to use, easy to hold, the grip is decent, and this is a quality product. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it oozes quality but this also isn&#x27;t a 120$ brush. It actually isn&#x27;t as stiff as I would have liked but since this is the first brush I have ever purchased, I wouldn&#x27;t have known that. I am not disappointed with this brush and it is a great value. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with it, but this isn&#x27;t some awesome hand crafted art piece. It is meant to be used, perhaps a bit rough, and it seems to hold up well.</li>
    <li> Nice soft brush just a little smaller than I expected. Smells a little funny at first but that goes away.</li>
    <li> This is a fine travel brush. I travel a lot more often than not and want a nice, comfortable shave when I am out and about. I shave twice a week and this brush is a good travel companion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of warning to anyone looking for the Ultimate Wet Shaving OMG I Own A Badger Brush experience: This will not do it for you. Please find something that&#x27;s around 200 dollars. You&#x27;ll be much happier that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone else who are just looking to have a decent, lathery shaving experience and would be content to occasionally wash a badger bristle or two down the drain without spending heaps of money for something practical and affordable, this ain&#x27;t a bad choice. Yes, it has a but of badger funk when it gets wet. I used regular liquid soap to clean it. My mug is just a regular, heavy, ceramic mug made in the USA with an eagle stamp on the bottom. Yard sale score: 50 cents. This brush swirls the soap around just fine to get a rich lather. I read some reviews of brushes where people score them poorly because they don&#x27;t make a rich lather in their shaving mug. These are the people I was referring to a few sentences ago who would be much happier with a $200 brush. Wink wink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to friends; buy one as a gift for my brother and buy another one when the one I have is kaput. Until then, I will continue enjoying this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep your bristles pointed down for drying and have fun shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---[20160809]---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly 2 years of regular use and it&#x27;s still holding up. The handle is good; the wood isn&#x27;t swollen. I bought a premium silver badger brush for a lot of money for home use but it fell apart after almost 2 months. Very disappointing. I am planning to buy another one to put away for when this current one wears out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 20171112&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a second one because I like it so much, I don&#x27;t want to wear it out and not have a reliable backup. Same good quality as my last one.</li>
    <li> Not premium, corse white and I doubt if this was even badger, cheap wooden handel, not the brush I expected so I returned the product and bought a high quality brush from &amp;#34;Parker Saftey Razor&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This brush is not good value. It does not keep its shape after it dries. I would not purchase an other product by this manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty new to straight razor shaving, but I&#x27;m fairly certain that I got a good deal with this brush. Very smooth on the face and does a good job lathering my Crabtree &amp; Evelyn Nomad Shave Soap!</li>
    <li> I have always been a horse and boar hair bush guy. I like the stiffness of these brushes, they allow me to load up soap, and lather up quickly.  This is my first badger had brush, and thoughly pleased with the performance. I have heard about the smell and the loss of bristles, but none of that occurred. The feel of this brush is almost tickling, but the softness allows a different, smoother lather on your face. I sold on the badger hair brush, and for the price this is a deal.&lt;br /&gt;My next adventure is Silver Tip badger brush...</li>
    <li> Getting back into wet shaving. This brush is very nice. I don&#x27;t lose many hairs each shave and works very well.</li>
    <li> 30 is approximately how long I have been shaving...shaving wrong!  I have tried about every kind of cream from a can and they have always been a lesser of evils proposition.  I dont know quite why I started thinking about a brush but I mentioned it to my wife and put a super cheap &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; on my wish list from which she draws gifts and in some cases, like this one, ideas.  Rather than the $7 brush, bowl and soap kit I put in there to &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; wet shaving she went a little overboard with this brush, a nice chrome stand for it and the green tub of Proraso shaving soap.  The trio was considerably more than I would have spent on my own but par for her course in these sort of gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not even owned this brush for 48 hours and I have shaved four times.  Its no longer a chore and its actually quite enjoyable.  The brush does an excellent job working up a lather in the soap and its slightly prickly texture coupled with the eucalyptus oil and menthol in the Proraso really set up the beard for a thoroughly pleasant shave.  Prior to this I had noticeable irritation on my neck and cheeks for hours after shaving.  NO MORE!  Not at all.  My skin feels smooth and comfortable...and like never before!  Now I feel compelled to try a safety razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for what its worth, I love this brush.  Hell, I want to go shave right now.  But I have nothing to compare this to other than the utterly miserable experience to which I had just become accustomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> A great brush. If you take care of it, it should last for a long time. I&#x27;ve had for 6 months, and it still looks good as new.</li>
    <li> This product is of high quality and to maintain it so you&#x27;ll need to wash it with plenty on water and place in some sort of stand. Tip: stands are expensive, so I glued a round neodymium magnet to the bottom of it and it hangs from my over sink cabinet&#x27;s screw. Works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Easily produces adequate lather for a close shave.</li>
    <li> Love it. Have used it a week and the first time only the rinse water durned dark. After that no issues. Stiffer than the old Boar Hair brush but then it is old and used. There is a slight mushy odor at first but it is fading. As to durability, time will tell but so far, its good, I like it.</li>
    <li> I love this brush from Wet Shaving products. It feels great while lathering and has a classic look to it.  The wood handle has a nice grain to it and is overall a nice size for home use or travel.</li>
    <li> This brush is soft and full.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks and have had no bristles fall out (although a little minor shedding is pretty normal for any kind of brush).  It smells good too -- I bought another that cheap brush that smelled like 2-part epoxy at a local shop, and I could smell it for hours after I shaved.  I used it once and tossed it.  I&#x27;m super pleased -- well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it everyday and love it.</li>
    <li> Brush is has soft bristles that are firm.  Not as &amp;#34;floppy&amp;#34; as finest badger brushes.  Dries well and has a nice and a bit longer handle.  Feels soft on the face and so far has not shed hairs. good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for two months now and it&#x27;s only lost a few hairs.  It creates a nice lather and feels great on my face.  An amazing value, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with quality, looks and performance. It was as described and shipped on time. Worth to little extra money as compared to the cheap shaving brushes.</li>
    <li> Best shaving brush I have owned. Contrary to what you may have heard hair are not coming out. Good designed in America  product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to purchase a good shaving brush.  The brush has not shed at all and it spreads the lather very evenly.  It does have a slight odor, I suppose it is badger.  It is not a strong or objectionable odor just one I was not accustomed to.  I love the shave I get.  It is a pleasure to shave a perfectly moistened beard and not have to do it over.</li>
    <li> This is my first badger brush. It now sits besides a synthetic brush (The Body Shop), and the boar one (VDHagen) I started out with. After receiving it with two day shipping, and washing it out with shampoo and conditioner, and left out to dry. Used it the next morning, and man what a difference. Everything they write about a badger brush and how good it works is all true. Honestly, I don&#x27;t know if a $100.00 badger brush is going to make that much difference, but I do know for a fact this badger brush does well, at least against what I thought was a  really good synthetic one from The Body Shop. So, the rotation is in effect, and the brush really hasn&#x27;t shed yet. This is a damn good brush, and well worth more than it&#x27;s reasonable price. Happy Shaving....</li>
    <li> A handful of hairs continue to fall out  with every use  after several months  The break-in should be over  by now I anticipate the brush only lasting maybe a year</li>
    <li> This brush works very well.  It is very soft, and picks up lather very nicely</li>
    <li> You could spend a lot of money to get a more luxurious looking brush or you can pay a reasonable sum and get a really great shaving accessory like this Badger brush. Stop reading this review and order one.</li>
    <li> I noticed a couple of months ago that the bristles were getting softer and softer. Suddenly, this last week, the bristles have started falling out. I see them stuck in my Strop Shoppe Black Tie soap each morning when I go to lather up. This isn&#x27;t even a year old and it should not be happening this quickly.  I take care of my brush, too. I wash it after every use and hang it in the stand to dry.  I&#x27;m now looking for another brush.</li>
    <li> This was better than I hoped. It is soft and easy to clean</li>
    <li> Another super shave brush from WSP . These brushes can&#x27;t be beat and for the price they are the best. I have 3 brushes of WSP and all of them are very high quality. Some hair loss at the beginning and after that it is minimal . They whip up a great lather and very quickly too. This brush is a nice one for everyday or for a gift to a beginner just getting into wet shaving. It will make their first experience a good one and help to keep them going on there after. There is nothing worse than a bad experience at the beginning of something new. It turn&#x27;s people off real quick, so , if you want to set a good impression , buy this brush as a starter for any newbie . Thank You for a great product.</li>
    <li> works great.Minimal loss of hairs when used as directed.</li>
    <li> This is the worst shaving brush I have ever used.  It is very difficult to get a good lather.  I was using a $5 shaving brush earlier, which was way better.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> A GREAT SHAVING BRUSH, BUILDS UP LOT OF LATHER</li>
    <li> Beats the 50-75$ Baxter Badger brush. As a comparison, while the Baxter is beautiful with nicer finer hair, it has less size brush size and holds less soap (I like OSMA shaving soap). This brush is a great deal and a fine performer. If you use a boar brush, toss it and buy this, you&#x27;ll never go back. Ready to go out of the box.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s soft and it creates a great lather.</li>
    <li> This brush is pure quality, I am using it along with the Van Der Hagen Mens Luxury soap. The best combo ever.</li>
    <li> I loved the feel of the brush on my face when I shaved. It fits perfect in the razor stand that I bought from colonel conk evernice. Some of the natural bristle fall out when lathering the cream but that is to be expected with any brush. Does not affect shaving whatsoever. Overall great product</li>
    <li> Soft &amp; really lathers up well. Seems strong &amp; long lasting also! A great buy! SHould have bought this kind of brush a long, long time ago.</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  Soak it in warm water for a couple of minutes and it works beautifully on shaving soap.  It&#x27;s soft enough to be comfortable, but stiff enough to to get an even spread of lather and get a good lather from a shaving soap.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I received a jar of Jack Black shaving cream as birthday gift last spring.  I like the product but had to dig it out with my fingers and smear it on my face.  I received a second jar at Christmas.  At my son&#x27;s suggestion, I bought the shaving brush.  It&#x27;s very attractive and sheds very very little.  It is the perfect instrument for using this non-aerosol shaving product.  It uses very little of the cream but produces a good lather and a great shave.  I wish I had found this combination 40 years ago.</li>
    <li> Very nice badger brush for the price.  A tip for some of you who are &amp;#34;surprised&amp;#34; by the smell.  With natural hair brushes, you need to soak the bristles of the brush just below the handle.  I typically use an empty shaving mug and let it rest in there a few hours with warm water.  Don&#x27;t let the water get to the handle or you&#x27;ll reduce the life of the brush.  After soaking it, I usually lather it up with shave soap a few times, rinse very well.  It will reduce the smell of the natural badger bristles for your first uses.  As you use it, the smell lessens and after a couple months, you should no longer have that problem.  Make sure you thoroughly rinse the brush to remove ALL shaving soap, and dry it well.  I always use a dry hand towel and use a fast &amp;#34;flicking&amp;#34; motion brushing the bristle tips on the towel surface to help remove excess water.  Do that vigorously without bending the bristles until the bristles separate nicely.  If the bristles are matted and sticking together, you didn&#x27;t rinse the bristles well enough to get the soap out.  Re-rinse and re-dry.  Hang on a brush stand, don&#x27;t let the brush stand on its bristles.  The brush will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This works well, and so far is holding up quite well.</li>
    <li> this was a gift along with some shave soap and cologne.  it&#x27;s worth it to purchase a brush stand to keep this brush in nice condition.  &amp;#34;I love using that brush. . .&amp;#34;  Very nice looking piece of shaving equipment!</li>
    <li> The bristles/hair in my brush come out quite often.  It works the shaving soap into a good lather and puts it on nicely.  Just wish it held together better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Bristles are all tan and don&#x27;t have the nice look of the picture.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find a better badger hair brush for the price. I haven&#x27;t seen it lose a hair since the second shave with it. It also absorbed the scent of the soap pretty quickly. I&#x27;ve read that some badger brushes smell for a week or so, this one only smelled for a day. I hope this is still available if I ever need a replacement.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it! Very soft!</li>
    <li> Great product for the price</li>
    <li> Great brush with soft fibers that feel god on the skin and that doesn&#x27;t shed. Whips up a nice lather every time.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really compare this to any other shaving brush since this is the first I&#x27;ve used. Switching to a brush, shaving soap, and safety razor has been an awesome decision for me. I enjoy shaving much more than I used to. If you&#x27;re thinking of making the switch, just do it! No more razor burn for me. When I first started using the brush, strands would come off on my face as I applied the soap. That didn&#x27;t last though, and based on my reading of reviews, this is a common occurrence with new badger brushes.</li>
    <li> Gave to my husband as a gift, he does not care for it. He would like to bristles to be stiffer.</li>
    <li> Solid brush.  Much better then my first brand of brush that I fumbled into the pot.</li>
    <li> This brush has lots of body and holds the soap well.  Appears to be sturdy.  Had it for a while and it seems to be holding up well.</li>
    <li> This is not per say, a review of the Badger Brush, but rather Amazon&#x27;s service... I was sent the Premium \\&quot;Boar\\&quot; Bristle High Density Shaving Brush (39-JOW3_GKAZ) instead of the Badger brush (H1-KSU3-PO94) that I ordered. The bristles are all yellow, so obviously not what I ordered. The return is an inconvenience, additionally, I had to chat or e-mail customer service in order to get the RMA number.</li>
    <li> This is my first badger brush.  I expect it to smell a bit and lose hairs because that seems to be a part of any new badger brush.  There was never any smell that I could detect.  There was some hair loss initially but it was very minimal.  This is a great entry-level brush and I will definitely look to WSP for any future brush purchases.</li>
    <li> New to brush/soap shaving. Wife bought me nice soap and dish for gift. Needed brush and found this- love it. Does great job of lathering. Easy to clean,and looks good on counter.</li>
    <li> Nice and soft. Handle has a good feel. All in all, very pleased with the new brush. If this brush last as long as my first, I&#x27;ll never need to buy another.</li>
    <li> great brush! it definitely makes a difference when you are using a brush over a shaving cream. I recommend the brush :)</li>
    <li> I really like this brush. I would have given it 5 stars except it doesn&#x27;t fit my stand. I understand it will fit the WSP stand, but I don&#x27;t want to buy any more stands. Can&#x27;t the manufacturers standardize?</li>
    <li> Ordered one of these for my son&#x27;s (both in their early 30&#x27;s) along with high end shaving cream, they both loved them! Said they loved using the brushes and are thinking about switching to safety razors or even old fashioned straight razors for the best shave.</li>
    <li> I thought it was too pricey, but otherwise good. However, i paid about $30 for a boar-bristle brush and found it too stiff to use on my face, so I sprung for this one at an even higher price. I have used badger-bristle shaving brushes for 50 years and have worn out only two, so this should last me the rest of my life. But the price was stiff.</li>
    <li> I use with regular shave cream and with cream designed for a brush.  Bristles remain warm for a bit and help lift whiskers. Definitely adds to the closeness of a shave and easy to reapply more cream from the brush after the first pass.  Well made, looks like new after daily use of a few months now.</li>
    <li> very nice brush here , i like hows it smaller and not so wide so i can get detailed to where i apply lather , for the price its the best brush you can get. if you want top of the line get a silver tip badger all day.</li>
    <li> Love it and the bristles are just perfect for application of shaving soap.</li>
    <li> Very soft, good looking and good quality  so far. I have not had any problems with the brush loosing hair as I did with other brushes but I make sure to drain as much water as possible and hang it upside down from a stand. I have been using it since Christmas (2 months) with great results</li>
    <li> First time user of a shaving brush, so far so good. The expected scent from the pure badger hair brush is not offensive, we have a cat and my concern was that she would pick at the brush, like I said so far so good. It lathers well, is soft when applied to my face. I recommend this quality level brush for first time users.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this brush for a few days now, I washed it with soap and absolutely no bad smells.  The texture of the badger hair is perfect in my opinion stiff but soft at the same time.  Better than any other brush I&#x27;ve had,</li>
    <li> Love this shaving brush. Lathers up nice easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I love shaving with the Badger Shaving Brush. I get a closer shave and it reminds me of my dad shaving when I was a little tyke.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and he loves his new brush.</li>
    <li> Losing bristles daily - way past the few weeks it says to allow for losses. Bought it because it appeared to be well liked. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Nothing  special. There are better choices..</li>
    <li> excellent brush, worth the price , use with  Porasco shaving cream and you will have a great shave</li>
    <li> great shaving brush for the money.</li>
    <li> What can I say: it&#x27;s BADGER hair, for crying out loud.  Doesn&#x27;t get much manlier than that.  I&#x27;ve been using the brush for 2 weeks now.  Very few hairs have fallen out.  It whips up a good lather on my shave soap.  I soften the brush in hot water while showering, then shake off the excess water before I use it.  That first couple of passes on my face, when the soap is warm from the bristles: very nice.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving brush at an awesome price. This full badger hair brush feels good on the face, has an ergonomic wood handle, and dries and fans out nicely. I now look forward to shaving.</li>
    <li> This brush is probably the best shaving brush I&#x27;ve owned. It is much better than brushes you might end up paying 3-4x as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base is a bit cheap feeling (not as heavy as I&#x27;d prefer) but it does a fantastic job of creating a very smooth and even lather. I might buy another one for the road.</li>
    <li> good quality for its price, fiance loves it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice brush.  Holds together well, lathers well.  A little more poofy and soft than I like.</li>
