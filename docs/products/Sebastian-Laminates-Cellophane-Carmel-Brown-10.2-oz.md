      <li>I love it..</li>
      <li>I tried the seabstian cellophane (golden brunette) and loved the result.  </li>
      <li>But it really is a healthy hair alternative for people with hair problems, that want (or in my case) need hair color.</li>

      <li>It does really add some nice shine though, if you can be patient with application.</li>
      <li>It is great for covering grey hair and for damaged hair.</li>
      <li>only do cellophanes provide excellent gloss, they also leave your hair so soft and feathery</li>
      <li>I love this product it really works it makes your hair so skinny and smooth I will buy it again.</li>
      <li>Your hair Will look very shine and healthy.</li>
      <li>and I do use a mild relaxer on my hair.</li>
      <li>I tried this product years ago when I was pregnant and it did amazing things for my hair back then</li>
      <li>It covered my gray completely and my hair is healthy and shiny for the first time in years!</li>
      <li>By the way I used golden brunette.</li>
      <li>It came out a reddish brown with golden highlights.</li>
      <li>I keep the product underneath the cap for about 20-30 minutes and then wash it out using warm(not hot) water.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really covers greys!</li>
      <li>First time trying a color.</li>
      <li>( if you flat iron) you wont be able to keep you fingers out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Only problem is high adherence to scalp, which demands many hair washes days after.</li>
      <li>, you try to wash it off the first time and soo much color come off, then you shampoo again, and soo much falls off again.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair super shiny and soft.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty runny -  thru hair like shampoo, cap on, under the dryer with high heat for 20 minutes and done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This always makes my hair really shinny.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s REALLY</li>
      <li>Mush - very generously -</li>
      <li>After applying liberally to my hair, I gently massaged it into the hair to evenly distribute the product.</li>
      <li>often buy the Clear, Coffee bean and Golden brunette.  </li>
      <li>This product adds shine and body to my once very damaged hair.  </li>
      <li>I am now 50 and have gray coming in fast.  </li>
      <li>but I put it down in part to healthy pregnancy hair.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m letting it grow out from a super short razor cut pixie.  </li>
      <li>I know it is geared toward High End salons and High Fashion.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle on your hair and the color is clear and shinny...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used henna for several years and have loved it, but ready to go back to as close as I can to my natural color (red gets old) which is a lightish golden brown-well before grey anyhow :</li>
      <li>Wish I have returned it right away for money back..</li>
      <li>First I bought the golden brunette which left my hair black and the first time you put it on</li>
      <li>My hair looked and felt exactly the same as it did before I used this.</li>
      <li>Everything else is the same ;)</li>
      <li>it subtly blended my hair without looking dark and also left it far  more healthy, shiny &amp; manageable!</li>
      <li>Usually i will mix clear with the others to get more of a glossy shine.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
      <li>I followed all the instructions and nothing other than my hair got more dry afterwards...</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ve colored your hair purple - use clear.  </li>
      <li>It made my hair extremely soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I shampooed, towel dried, applied the cellophanes, and put on a plastic shower cap, and applied heat from a hair dryer for a couple of minutes, left the shower cap on for a while more, shampooed out and conditioned.</li>
      <li>This makes it shinny but not black.  </li>
      <li>reluctant to go back to being a brunette, i re-discovered this product that i had used in the past with lovely results.</li>
      <li>I have order this in red red and hot red now</li>
      <li>First of all it&#x27;s really messy and smelly, nothing new for hair color</li>

<li> I been using this product for a long time</li>
<li> Only problem was that I got a color that shows darker than I expected.</li>
<li> Be careful, it enhanced red....</li>
<li> I was literally in tears because nothing I used covered my gray hair and everything made my hair dry and brittle.</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t use caramel brown over anything other than dark blonde, red or brunette</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I followed all the instructions and nothing other than my hair got more dry afterwards... No shine, no color no nothing. Sad so much hope in a product and so disappointed. Wish I have returned it right away for money back..</li>
    <li> I did not like this product.. I have used cellophane before but at the hair salon and it never did this.  First I bought the golden brunette which left my hair black and the first time you put it on, you try to wash it off the first time and soo much color come off, then you shampoo again, and soo much falls off again.  Doesn&#x27;t last long, wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle product. It makes my hair super shiny and soft. I apply this product from the tips of my hair to the roots using a disposable glove. After applying liberally to my hair, I gently massaged it into the hair to evenly distribute the product. The product is heat-activated; I then covered my hair with a hair cap and gently moved my hairdryer over it(set on warm/low setting) for a few minutes. I keep the product underneath the cap for about 20-30 minutes and then wash it out using warm(not hot) water. The result is beautiful shiny, salon quality hair!</li>
    <li> Good product for your hair.  Your hair Will look very shine and healthy.</li>
    <li> Nice and easy. Do not damage hair. Only problem is high adherence to scalp, which demands many hair washes days after.</li>
    <li> my colorist went too dark when i went in for my base color. huge mistake!! i panicked since i had left the salon with 2 inches of dark brown roots and the rest of my hair with blond highlights!! what was she thinking?? reluctant to go back to being a brunette, i re-discovered this product that i had used in the past with lovely results. it subtly blended my hair without looking dark and also left it far  more healthy, shiny &amp; manageable! it will all wash out after several shampoos, as it&#x27;s deposit only and i can return to my usual routine.  just remember to use gloves, apply to slightly damp hair for 20-30 minutes. if possible, put on a shower cap and apply heat from a blow dryer for a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with my purchaes. LAMINATES , the black castor oil I havent began to use it yet and the parts for the Mini Cooper was correct</li>
    <li> I love this product! I had forgotten about cellophanes for years and had been using permanent hair color. I was literally in tears because nothing I used covered my gray hair and everything made my hair dry and brittle. Then one day I remembered this product, went online and was pleased to find out it was being sold through Amazon. It covered my gray completely and my hair is healthy and shiny for the first time in years! I am African American and I do use a mild relaxer on my hair. I mention this because if you use it immediately after a relaxer, it will be a more permanent color. Which is what I wanted. It is beautiful and every where I go people compliment my hair color, and the shine. I am so thankful that this product exists, without it I considered wearing a wig. I wish Sebastian would advertise more so that everyone would know about this excellent product. I know it is geared toward High End salons and High Fashion. But it really is a healthy hair alternative for people with hair problems, that want (or in my case) need hair color. By the way I used golden brunette. It came out a reddish brown with golden highlights. Please NEVER stop making this product!</li>
    <li> I tried this product years ago when I was pregnant and it did amazing things for my hair back then but I put it down in part to healthy pregnancy hair.&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to today and I straighten my hair with keratin which sometimes leaves my hair looking \\&quot;stringy.\\&quot;  I tried the seabstian cellophane (golden brunette) and loved the result.  Aside from covering a few grey hairs, it leaves my hair feeling and looking fuller, thicker and very shiney.  I am sold on this product.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this! I&#x27;ve used henna for several years and have loved it, but ready to go back to as close as I can to my natural color (red gets old) which is a lightish golden brown-well before grey anyhow :-/. After doing research I realized that my best bet over the henna was something peroxide free. I had a lot of trouble finding anything, until I came across this product. It&#x27;s really covers greys! I did let the henna grow out and fade for six months before attempting chemical, this will be a beautiful brown while I continue to grow out the henna. Blends really pretty and gorgeous shine. Then onto the next color adventure...</li>
    <li> great  purchase and my wife loved it.</li>
    <li> This product adds shine and body to my once very damaged hair.  It is great for covering grey hair and for damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I been using this product for a long time and I love it, great color and shine. Only problem was that I got a color that shows darker than I expected.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why these fell out of favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was starting to be unhappy with my hair, in general.  It was getting frizzy, wasn&#x27;t shiny, was limp and wasn&#x27;t damaged.  It was just misbehaving.  Permanent color wasn&#x27;t the answer, changing shampoos/conditioners helped, but still wasn&#x27;t the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a flashback to a time - longer ago than I care to admit - that I used these - and loved these.  So, to Google to see if they still existed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do.  *YAY!*.  They don&#x27;t damage the hair.  They are easy to use.  It wraps your hair cuticle and makes it shiny again, Adds body, Frizzies are controlled better.  Color is just sprinkles on the cupcake after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing you&#x27;ll have to buy to do them is an old-fashioned bonnet style hair dryer, gloves and a shower cap.  Mush - very generously - it&#x27;s pretty runny -  thru hair like shampoo, cap on, under the dryer with high heat for 20 minutes and done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caramel Brown is a warm, medium  brown that glazes over your hair color.  It covers gray a little.  They last about a month.  If you&#x27;ve colored your hair recently, it will help hold the color in.  I wouldn&#x27;t use caramel brown over anything other than dark blonde, red or brunette though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve colored your hair purple - use clear.  Everything else is the same ;)</li>
    <li> This Cellophane is Great for the hair! It gives Color, Texture, Smoothness and it smells amazing! Have to repurchase this.</li>
    <li> I love this product it really works it makes your hair so skinny and smooth I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is the stuff!  It&#x27;s gentle on your hair and the color is clear and shinny...well like cellophane.  It&#x27;s perfect and this color is great or my hair.  My hair is very, very dark brown.  This makes it shinny but not black.  Excellent!!!</li>
    <li> This product is a bit hard to apply, and will really stain your forehead, hands, etc. Be prepared to have an application brush and gloves. It does really add some nice shine though, if you can be patient with application. I used a blow dryer to add heat for a few minutes before rinsing.</li>
    <li> This was a very good cellophane. Lasted a long time. Gave my hair a glossy shine and the caramel colour showed through. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This always makes my hair really shinny. First time trying a color. Came out nice. Be careful, it enhanced red....</li>
    <li> Excellent // I love it.. When I can I will purchase another one .. of course. Tanks for this purchase</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this didn&#x27;t work for me, but it just didn&#x27;t.  My hair looked and felt exactly the same as it did before I used this.</li>
    <li> This product is for my mother in-law she needs to get some shine in her hair when she gets it colored.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Helps hair look and feel great.  It&#x27;s my go to. I like the Carmel or chocolate color helps restore color to highlights on dark hair in between salon visits.</li>
    <li> The last time I got my hair colored in a salon, I hated it - I thought it looked too dark and very obviously fake. I mean, it IS fake, you&#x27;re dying your hair. But everyone kept saying to me &amp;#34;Oh! did you dye your hair?&amp;#34; (which I thought was rude to say to a lady? Ahem). Not what I wanted. I just want a subtle gloss to my natural hair color. This delivered! AND at a great price and without having to go to the hair salon. I was only able to leave this in for 15 minutes but it looks great. I shampooed, towel dried, applied the cellophanes, and put on a plastic shower cap, and applied heat from a hair dryer for a couple of minutes, left the shower cap on for a while more, shampooed out and conditioned. I have plenty of product left too, so I&#x27;ll definitely use it again in a few weeks!</li>
    <li> Just got done applying the glaze and am happy with product and delivery.</li>
    <li> My hair is chin length with layers and I&#x27;m letting it grow out from a super short razor cut pixie.  I am now 50 and have gray coming in fast.  I fried my hair with color or a protien treatment; and some ends are horrible.  I have been deep conditioning, split end treatments, etc. and nothing will help those ends.  I purchased this for a easy color on my hair and it delievered! BUT, those bad ends I&#x27;ve been struggling with are SOOO much better now!  I will never use another dye on my hair.  The fact that it is temporary is great.  I have order this in red red and hot red now so I can change the colors up.  GREAT PRODUCT! Oh, it covered my gray wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and great coverage for gray hair.  It also makes my hair shiny and silky. And it doesn&#x27;t leave a chemical-like smell on my hair.</li>
    <li> Sebastian Cellophanes are great for making your natural color pop with shine. This product provides a transparent glossy color coverage that I have been unable to obtain with any other semi permanent coloring systems.&lt;br /&gt;This also provides good coverage for my unruly gray hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often buy the Clear, Coffee bean and Golden brunette.  Usually i will mix clear with the others to get more of a glossy shine.&lt;br /&gt;Not only do cellophanes provide excellent gloss, they also leave your hair so soft and feathery ( if you flat iron) you wont be able to keep you fingers out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts about six weeks for me, I am AA and I am transistioning to texlaxed.  I wash my 4ab hair about 2-3x/week.</li>
    <li> After all the great reviews I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. First of all it&#x27;s really messy and smelly, nothing new for hair color but it&#x27;s REALLY messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took forever to rinse out, tons of color kept going down the drain. The resulting color didn&#x27;t even cover gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was pointless.</li>
    <li> Finally, I found this product to color my hair beautifully. I am allergic to Amonia and peroxide. This product was great covering my gray. It made my hair extremely soft and shiny. I would recommend this product. I relax my hair and it seems this product never disappoints. I have been using this product in my early 30&#x27;s now that I am in my late forties, other products have damaged my hair. I can see a difference in my hair since I have began to this the Cellophanes.</li>
