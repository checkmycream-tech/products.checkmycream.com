      <li>Although it might be a bit trickier to apply for beginners, I still think it’s one of the best formulas around and very affordable.</li>
      <li>Once I used gloves, I liked it.</li>
      <li>Its a good product, but I feel like there could be better ones out there instead.</li>
      <li>what she liked about this one is that it made her skin glow.</li>
      <li>and I am loving getting some color.</li>
      <li>It works wonderfully and safely to achieve a gorge glow ;)</li>
      <li>I dont even want to use it, the smell is like a cheap cucumber scent that isn&#x27;t pleasant once one either.</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t a very strong self tanning odor or anything.</li>
      <li>I just make sure to apply it when I&#x27;m home for the day or its a no hugging day!&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>thats right 2 days!!!</li>
      <li>By far the best I have used.</li>
      <li>I use the tanning maintainer along with my own body lotion for a more moisture.</li>
      <li>but my skin doesn&#x27;t smell so great that first day.  </li>
      <li>you are fine with just buying the tanning lotion!</li>
      <li>It goes on very smoothly and evenly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very light</li>
      <li>It gives a nice color and you won&#x27;t look orange and it smells pretty good.</li>
      <li>Be smart in the application and you&#x27;ve got a great product to work with.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that orange hue that many self tanners do.</li>
      <li>tanwise is much better</li>
      <li>I am certainly glad I purchased it.</li>
      <li>I can confidently apply it to my face and not worry about streaks or splotches.  </li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>Keep in mind, that in order to maintain your tan, you need to make sure your skin is moisturized and hydrated.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Was hesitant like others about purchasing on here but figured it was best to go amazon since so many reviews i&#x27;ve read stated that the actual sunlabsonline website took forever (weeks) for shipping.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Before I ordered this I had been looking and researching self tanners for a couple of weeks and Sun Labs always seemed to come out on top.</li>
      <li>if I can do it, you can too :)</li>
      <li>I have grown to love this lotion and will still use it even if I&#x27;m not using the self tanning</li>
      <li>Be sure to use this in the shower before you apply the self tanner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>My skin is getting better and better.</li>
      <li>I really love it and it works like a champ.</li>
      <li>I will return for more.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the best sunless tanner I&#x27;ve owned.  Actually, this is the only one I&#x27;d use at this point.  Be smart in the application and you&#x27;ve got a great product to work with.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because it claims to be a set. However, it cost $40.00 and only came with ONE of the products, which you can buy for only $28.00. Do NOT buy this if you are looking for the set.</li>
    <li> Great! Feels amazing on my skin!! I highly recommend to everyone !!</li>
    <li> I thought that the color looked good and I have fair skin. It doesn&#x27;t look orange at all. It&#x27;s a bit messy to put on and does take a little time to get it right. I used gloves after the first experience because it was difficult to get off my hands after such a long application time. Once I used gloves, I liked it. I didn&#x27;t find the pre or post lotions and scrubs very useful. Next time I will just purchase the tan lotion.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on self tanning lotion before I made my choice to purchase this. Shipping was fast and the product was exactly what the description stated. However, the tanning lotion SMELLS after you leave it on. Like awful tanning bed lotion. The tan extender? I dont even want to use it, the smell is like a cheap cucumber scent that isn&#x27;t pleasant once one either. The only thing I dont mind is exfoliating body wash. It does its job and you feel a little bit cleaner after wards. The tanning lotion does not tan your face. AT ALL. I tan easily in the bed, always have. Even with other self tanning lotions it takes to my skin very easily. This stuff? Its like I dont even apply it. When I do use it, it does not leave streaks, OR turn me orange. I was surprised when first using it at how much it looked like i had used the tanning bed. I was impressed. If it just tanned my face, i would give this 5 stars. Its a good product, but I feel like there could be better ones out there instead.</li>
    <li> I just got in my hand. I am certainly glad I purchased it. Very fast delivery and good quality, impressed. Would use this brand again and would recommend it to anyone who has use</li>
    <li> This was a great birthday gift for my friend. She told me that it really helped her with her dry skin. She has used other products and what she liked about this one is that it made her skin glow. I feel that it is a great product for people with dry skin and it seems to work really well and quickly and my friend loved and wants me to buy her some more. This set also includes body gel and a moisturizer maintainer which made this the perfect gift choice for my friend.</li>
    <li> This was by far the worst tanning lotion i have used. It leaves streaks and looks orange.The tanning maintainer does not even maintain the &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;. It was a HORIBBLE product. Defenetly not worth the price.</li>
    <li> My Sister-in-Law got this awesome Ultra Dark Self Tanning Lotion Set from Sun Laboratories for me as a gift, recently. We have a big vacation planned and I can&#x27;t stand being pale at the beach. I was a little reluctant at first, since it says Super Dark, and I didn&#x27;t have much color yet. I don&#x27;t know what I was afraid of because this set is AMAZING!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, the most important step is the first step....Exfoliation! To get the tanner to go on smooth and even, you have to exfoliate first!  If you don&#x27;t do this, your tan won&#x27;t last and you will have streaks. It&#x27;s also important to remember to wear gloves when you apply the tanner. If you don&#x27;t, you will have stains on the palms of your hands. Be careful when using it on your toes, ankles, knees, elbows and hands. Anywhere on your body that the skin isn&#x27;t smooth requires extra careful application. Keep in mind, that in order to maintain your tan, you need to make sure your skin is moisturized and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, this set contains everything you need to prepare, apply and maintain a luxurious dark bronze glow. I like the results, I don&#x27;t look like an Oompa-Loompa!!  It goes on smoothly and if you do all of the steps properly, you will get great results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You receive:  8oz Self-Tanner,  9oz Exfoliating Gel,  9oz Moisturizer Maintainer&lt;br /&gt;Everything you need is right here in this kit!&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the results of this awesome package and so glad my Sister-in-Law got this for me!</li>
    <li> I have always been a big sunless tanner user because i hated being pale and was tired of the heinous smells. in the summer time i get very dark and im italian so i have naturally darker toned skin I had done my research on sunlabs and always heard good things about it so i thought i would give it a try. I am so surprised how well it works when i applied the sunless dark tanning lotion there was an instant tint and it continued to get darker, a little also goes a long way so dont over apply. its been a WEEK since i have used the product and i am still TAN it does fade a little but using the extra moisturizing lotion really helps. the exfoliant is awesome i use it regularly especially in the winter weather it really helps your skin. I suggest this product to anyone who is looking for the summer state of mind and bronze while living in the winter!</li>
    <li> i bought this for my cruise i was going on around thanksgiving and it worked great... only down fall is i swam in chlorine pools so it did come off a little bit faster than usual but IT STILL LOOKED GREAT!!!! WILL DEF ORDER MORE WHEN THIS IS OUT!!! WOULD RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE!!!</li>
    <li> I was VERY excited to try this.  However, with that being said I must admit I am left feeling disappointed.  Yes, you will instantly get a tan and it will darken over time.  However, that icky smell of &amp;#34;self tanner&amp;#34; will make an appearance once it has set into your skin.  I smelt like tanner for DAYS after applying.  I did not want to keep switching back and forth the first time around because the after smell on my skin was just to much for me.  I HATE the way it starts to go away.  I tried not scrubbing to hard at first to avoid any weird scrub marks...but no matter how I hard I tried I could not avoid the aftermath of marks.  I was left having to scrub scrub scrub to try and get this color off my body.  I&#x27;m not saying its a bad product, I did get tan.  My advice though is if you&#x27;re going to try this product be prepared to be committed to it if you want to continue to have EVEN color.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about 2 weeks. My skin is getting better and better. It&#x27;s a winner for me. I will return for more.</li>
    <li> I was very excited when i placed my order... but turned my skin orange!! I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Never used self tanners before, always stuck with tanning bed. Wanted to be healthier for myself and try a less harsh approach to getting tan. This works fabulous!! I was scared at first that I would have streaks or be orange but I had no problems! Just shower, exfoliate with body puff, lotion on dry areas, apply self tanner, sleep, shower in morning and perfect tan when I wake up. Haven&#x27;t tried any other brand and probably won&#x27;t. I&#x27;m still tan from tanning bed so I should have got ultra dark but either way I can see a difference next morning. This is a must!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many self tanners in my days. This one is definitely my favorite. The tan looks natural and lasts. It doesn&#x27;t have that orange hue that many self tanners do. I recently ran out and will buy another. Great for the winter months.</li>
    <li> I have used the tanner for a few months.  I can confidently apply it to my face and not worry about streaks or splotches.  The color is immediate and looks natural (but dark).  A huge positive for me is that it doesn&#x27;t wash off unevenly after application when I wash my hands, etc.  A light residue comes off in the shower the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a little problem with stained palms but figured out to wash my hands at least 3 xs during the application with the green scrub and a washcloth.  The color stays on for about 5-7 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other drawback is the odor which is a common problem with self tanners.  I don&#x27;t know if its a chemical reaction with my body but my skin doesn&#x27;t smell so great that first day.  I just make sure to apply it when I&#x27;m home for the day or its a no hugging day!&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> By far the best I have used. I don&#x27;t think it makes me look orange and it does not streak. Feet and hands are still tricky.</li>
    <li> Great product, gives a nice natural color, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad. The only huge advise I can give, is exfoliate well, avoid heels of feet, and work fast when applying. Do NOT...go back over areas that you&#x27;ve already applied.  If you go back over areas that have started drying (it dries quick), it will kind of ball/clump up.  Work quick and leave it alone to dry!</li>
    <li> This self tanning is great, no allergies, smells great! My only compliant, it doesn&#x27;t not last long, after shower or pool, it fades away!</li>
    <li> I like this tanner and the kit quite a bit. It is the best smelling tanner I&#x27;ve ever had.. The developed smell isn&#x27;t bad and the color&lt;br /&gt;guard is the perfect shade for seeing where you apply it and being able to blend it well. Not messy and gives me the longest lasting tan I&#x27;ve found in self-tanners thus far.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every self tanner out there. Sun Labs products are pretty good...the exfoliant smells like a minty fresh mouthwash (light and refreshing, not overbearing), the moisturizing lotion smells like cucumber melon, and the tanning lotion itself smells like cherry/almond...until the next morning and then you have that typical gross fake tan smell. I wish the lovely scent lasted. The tanning lotion works well particularly on my upper body. My legs....eh. I find that despite exfoliating and moisturizing it still gets clogs in my pores and creates dark spots (but I also just have really dark hair follices/pores to begin with, so it might just be a personal problem...haha). I ALWAYS have problems on my ankles/feet no matter what I do with this product. I HIGHLY recommend using gloves when applying this product. The few times I didn&#x27;t, I had gross/orangey/patchy palms for days. Even if it looks like you got it all off right after applying, chances are you didn&#x27;t and the next day it will look awful and leave you scrubbing for DAYS! The color is pretty nice, though. More of a brown and not orangey. I&#x27;m still searching for the perfect product though!</li>
    <li> Great self tanner that lasts! Make sure you exfoliate well and use latex gloves before applying the self tanner otherwise it will stain your hands. I recommend having someone do your back (for obvious reasons) and be very careful when applying to the feet.  WARNING: Do Not Use while intoxicated, you will wake up the next morning wondering why somebody played w/ amazon mud paint on you!!</li>
    <li> So I am pretty much the whitest person you can ever meet. Every time I try a tanning product I look awful and orange and uneven. I finally found this and I feel like it really works for me. I don&#x27;t have to do it very often because it stays on well (and I don&#x27;t want to be too dark). This set is killer and I really am excited to use it to be just a bit tanner for my wedding in August. I think people of all skin types would benefit from this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this tanner for a while now and I absolutely adore it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPLICATION&lt;br /&gt;A bit more tricky than mousse/spray obviously, but nothing you can&#x27;t handle. However, I do use this with a mitt so that might also explain why I have an easy time applying it. Start with the scrub. It’s amazing and has a pleasant smell. Getting all the dead skin and dirt off of your skin will make application SO much easier. Once you pat dry Apply stage 2. The Bronzer. Since it is a lotion you will have a bit more time to rub it in before it goes streaky, however the lotion can have a tendency to stick to some areas,( elbows, ankles, knees) but just rub the tanner in quickly and you should have no problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COLOR&lt;br /&gt;The color on this tanner is gorgeous! Although this stuff stains my mitt greenish-brown (?)  I find that the undertones on it, once you wash it off your body of course, are a true brown or even a reddish brown. It looks very natural, however it is a bit browner than other tans. So if you are super pale, I’d go easy on the first application. But in my opinion it makes me look very natural. The lotion does have a guide color that is MEGA brown, but don’t be afraid, once you wash it off the effect is not as intense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one application, the tan left behind isn&#x27;t super dark, however I like to do bi weekly applications and this takes me from a Rihanna to a JLO.  YMMV obviously :) My darkest shade loses its intensity after about 2 showers, and for the rest of week I become around a Jessica Alba. It fades rather evenly, but some areas do get a bit funny looking. (Neck especially) Nothing too obvious though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FORMULA&lt;br /&gt;Sun Laboratories tanners has one of the best self-tanner smells ever, it reminds me of cherries mixed with almonds. SMELLS SO GOOD. It even has a pleasant after smell….so BONUS! That being said though it takes a while to dry once you apply it like 1 hour to 1 hour and a half. It feels really gross, and you can’t sit on anything because it sticks to you ( I find a blow dryer on cool setting will cut this time down by more than half) I have sensitive skin and it doesn’t seem to affect my face or chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LASTLY&lt;br /&gt;Use the moisturizer. I put it on once a day and it helps maintain my color and keep it even.  Also helps with the dry spots so when applying my next application it stays nice and even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is fantastic self-tanner and one of the best smelling around! I will definitely repurchase.. Although it might be a bit trickier to apply for beginners, I still think it’s one of the best formulas around and very affordable.I find a blow dryer on cool setting will cut this time down by more than half) I have sensitive skin and it doesn’t seem to affect my face or chest.

    <li> If you are a fair skin person do NOT buy this product!!! It turned my skin orange with in hours, no streaks or uneven applied spots, just completely orange! After 2 days my skin started looking very dirty...:(&lt;br /&gt;This was such a waste of money for me. I don&#x27;t even feel this deserves a 1 star rating. :(</li>
    <li> The scrub is amazing. Seriously. I really love it and it works like a champ. I have only used the sunless tanner once so far and I didn&#x27;t see the results I guess I was expecting but I also only left it on for 3 hours to be cautious, so this weekend I will try sleeping in it and I am almost positive that will produce what I am looking for. But it did give me some color and THAT I appreciate. It was a nice tan too, not a fake orangish streaky mess that sunless tanners used to be. I am very pale, my legs won&#x27;t budge an inch in color even if I sit out for hours in the sun (which I wouldn&#x27;t anyways) so it was nice to FINALLY see some color on them. The maintainer lotion from what I can tell is just a lotion to keep your skin hydrated and that helps keep the tan longer. From what I can read and see it doesn&#x27;t have a slight tint or anything which was disappointing. I thought for some odd reason it would have a nice tint to it to slightly add color so you would only have to apply the sunless tanner once a week. I hate re-applying mid week. The smell of the sunless tanner was nice and it didn&#x27;t turn into that yucky chemical smell within a few minutes, so that was super nice. The lotion/maintainer on the other hand had this weird sickly sweet smell that was just a little too sweet smelling. It wasn&#x27;t horrible but it wasn&#x27;t amazing either. All in all it is worth the buy and try. Makes sunless tanners not so scary anymore and I am loving getting some color.</li>
    <li> Not as stinky as other store bought tanners. I wear gloves  during application and do my hands last so I don&#x27;t get super dark hand webbing.</li>
    <li> This is the only tanner ive used that looks completely natural. Its buildable and i like that. No orange tint. Smell isnt too bad, reminds me of cherries.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It doesn&#x27;t make you stink and it makes you look naturally tan.</li>
    <li> Before I ordered this I had been looking and researching self tanners for a couple of weeks and Sun Labs always seemed to come out on top. While I am an avid Amazon shopper I was EXTREMELY leary of buying this product due to it having NO reviews. I have always been satisfied with my Amazon purchases so I gave in and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW TIME:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping/Delivery: I paid the extra 8 or 10 dollars to have it shipped in 2 days, it arrived the next day. It came with all 3 bottles and a loofah sponge. Rating 10 out of 10!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ULTRA DARK SELF TANNING LOTION: The smell is GREAT unlike most self tanners, it&#x27;s kind of a cherry smell. The color of the lotion is VERY dark but don&#x27;t be intimidated because it blends very well with your skin. I like the lotion being so dark so you can see where you are putting it. It goes on very smoothly and evenly. This lotion does NOT make you look orange. I feel like I acheived the color I would get from laying in the tanning bed for two weeks after just two uses of this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use your hands to apply the lotion be sure to wash them as soon as you are finished! I use dish soap and a dish sponge to scrub it off haha :) Use whatever seems to work best! You can add some of the exfoliater for the tough spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do happen to end up with streaks (I did the first time I used it) You can get a sponge or whatever you used to wash it off of your hands with and just scrub the heck out of whatever part of you has streaks! The exfoliater will help too. That should do the trick to blending any streaks in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS TOTALLY SAFE FOR YOUR FACE. I have very sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Self Tanning Lotion Rating: 9 out of 10!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliant: I really like the exfoliating gel. Maybe because before now I didn&#x27;t exfoliate very often but now my skin is soooo soft and smooth! You have to use a good bit of it to really get the lathery body wash feel but other than that, it is a great product. Be sure to use this in the shower before you apply the self tanner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliater Rating: 8 out of 10!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintainer Lotion: I definitely notice a difference in how long my tan lasts between using and not using the maintainer lotion.It goes on very smoothly and keeps my skin really soft. The smell is very similiar to Bath &amp; Body Works&#x27; Cucumber Melon. I have grown to love this lotion and will still use it even if I&#x27;m not using the self tanning lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintainer Rating: 9 out of 10!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHAKE THE SELF TANNER BOTTLE BEFORE EACH USE!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply to small sections at a time, it dries pretty quickly. I start with my face and work my way down. Face, chest,top section of my arm, bottom section of my arm (repeat on other arm), stomach, top of leg, bottom of leg (repeat on other leg :)), you may want to get someone else to do your back if you aren&#x27;t very flexible and don&#x27;t want streaks..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply a light amount to your feet, especially on your toes and ankles, they tend to look a lot darker and can make your feet look funky! If all else fails get some soap and/or exfoliater and SCRUB SCRUB SCRUB!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says to alternate the self tanner and maintainer between night and morning, I don&#x27;t notice a drastic difference in the tan itself but after a while of applying ONLY at night I did notice it was becoming more difficult for my skin to absorb the self tanner lotion. I have no idea if it was my imagination or if it had something to do with applying the lotion at night each time but if you run into this problem try alternating nights and days each time you apply the tanner to see if it helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I 100% recommend these products. If you have any questions, just comment on this review and I will be happy to answer them! :)than that, it is a great product.

    <li> I got it within a day very fast shipping but, it doesn&#x27;t make me very dark at all! I like the smell of all three but it doesn&#x27;t make very dark I used sungoddess before this and that made me really dark this doesn&#x27;t and it turn my hands a little orange maybe I put it on my hands wrong but I put it on my hands how someone told me to. It&#x27;s pretty good but to me for a few more dollars I could be darker and get sungoddess maybe it&#x27;s just my type of skin but so far that&#x27;s how it has worked.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am a licensed Aesthetician in 2 different states. I have tried SEVERAL self tanners as an alternative to tanning beds. I mean who doesn&#x27;t want a nice safe glow? I ordered the tanning set in ultra dark. I have a pretty fair complexion and I thought the Ultra Dark was just right. It doesn&#x27;t give you an extreme color change- it&#x27;s just nice and subtle. Sometimes I apply twice to achieve a darker color- so it just depends on what you like. There isn&#x27;t a very strong self tanning odor or anything. I use the tanning maintainer along with my own body lotion for a more moisture. It seems to help my tan last longer. I can&#x27;t figure out if there is self tanning properties in the tanning maintainer or not? Either way, it works! I would and have recommended this product to friends, family and clients. It works wonderfully and safely to achieve a gorge glow ;) Also It is paraben free and cruelty free! hurray!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of sunless tanner. I have finally found THEE sunless tanner. Smells great, cherry almond. No weird tanner smell. Goes on like lotion and your skin is hydrated. It does go on dark but as you rub it in it looks like you&#x27;ve got an instant NATURAL tan. The color is amazing!! Seriously, like I&#x27;ve been out in the sun. Don&#x27;t know how it does it but I&#x27;m sooo glad it does! If you&#x27;re looking for a sunless tanner that delivers amazing natural color AND smells amazing look no further. You will NOT be disappointed!! I promise!!</li>
    <li> It gives the best and even tan you can imagine the only thing I hate is the smell, and it last as long as your tan. You will smell burned for at least 3 days.</li>
    <li> I like this as a rub on tanning product. I accidentally ordered the Ultra Dark instead of the Ultra, Ultra Dark. I have dark hair and olive skin and it still worked. If your fairer skin and don&#x27;t want a super tan look it would be just fine. I&#x27;m just lazy and want darkest tan right away. It isn&#x27;t orange at all.</li>
    <li> Very good but gotta be really careful, easily leaves spots. Comes out faster than i would expect</li>
    <li> I used this product and it worked great,  no streaks or orange skin. Loved the result highly recommend this product for anytime of the year</li>
    <li> This stuff really does work.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a little more from this product. It gives a nice color and you won&#x27;t look orange and it smells pretty good. But I thought that the tanner was a little too thick and difficult to apply. Also, I don&#x27;t think the exfoliate actually did anything to make applying the tanner easier. It is not a bad product, but you still get streaking, even when you apply it with circular motions.</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant to buy this product. I did lots of research online and YouTube before purchasing. I will admit...I was still banking on it not really working for me like it did others. I was so wrong! You receive the set of 3 items and a loofa. I have used it twice and relieved so many compliments! They have actually asked me if I have been tanning in a bed, and their reaction when I tell them it&#x27;s lotion is awesome! It looks very natural. I am not very good at putting tanning lotions on, and I don&#x27;t have any streaks! I would recommend watching some videos on how to apply tanning lotion before you put it on. It definitely helped me!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is nice and smell is great! It does smell a little on the \\&quot;self tanner\\&quot; side after having it on for a day BUT it&#x27;s tolerable. It doesn&#x27;t stink at all! It&#x27;s a very light scent.&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering buying this product, I say go for it!!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t last long. 2 days..tanwise is much better I can go 4 days.</li>
    <li> I was highly, HIGHLY, skeptical about this product. After reading reviews, I decided to give a shot. I&#x27;m Irish, when I say this I mean I have red hair, green eyes, freckles, and the fairest skin ever!!! My friends give me crap since it&#x27;s very difficult for me to tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I digress, I ordered this product, I was excited when it came in. Of course I was hesitant to try the product. Last night I decided to go for it. This product is ABSOLUTELY, HANDS-DOWN, AMAZING!!!! I didn&#x27;t turn orange, I have a sun-kissed glow!!! My friends were shocked!!! I work under bright lightening and even there and the sun I wasn&#x27;t orange!!!! I will continue to buy this product!!! I LOVE IT!!!! I highly recommend it to EVERYONE!!!</li>
    <li> I love this self tanner!  I will say that I am biased as I have not tried many others, but I can give you my thoughts based on my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Gives a nice, natural looking tan.  I am extremely pale and after I put it on, I get so many compliments on how nice my tan looks.&lt;br /&gt;- Does not streak!  This is always my number one concern.  Again, I am extremely pale, so it would be very, very obvious on my skin if it were uneven.  I am even confident enough to apply it to my face.&lt;br /&gt; - Smells nice (or as nice as a tanning lotion can be).&lt;br /&gt;- It does not have to be applied daily.  Generally I will do it once a week during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;- The tinted lotion makes it clear when you&#x27;ve missed a spot when applying, so it helps to avoid mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- I hate having to sit with it on for 3 hours before washing it off.  That means I can&#x27;t do anything or get wet (i.e. clean) while it sets.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve noticed it rubs off faster in areas where you sweat or your skin rubs together (cleavage, crook in your arm, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;- The maintainer lotion is pretty pointless, just use a regular lotion to keep your skin moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think the positive far outweighs the negative.  I recommend this all the time to people, as I think the application time is worth the nice results in the end.</li>
    <li> Probably the best self tanner I have used.</li>
    <li> Pretty color but not very dark. Was disappointed with that. Also very hard to rub into skin . but its a very pretty color for such a cheap price</li>
    <li> Was hesitant like others about purchasing on here but figured it was best to go amazon since so many reviews i&#x27;ve read stated that the actual sunlabsonline website took forever (weeks) for shipping. Amazon took TWO...thats right 2 days!!! and it was a holiday weekend. I would definitely order again from this seller!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off my skin color is a light-medium. To give you an idea my current foundation is clinique in 34 nude beige.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product 4 times already. I use gloves every to apply. Everybody says that this product turns your hands orange. The smell is not that bad in comparison to others on the market and once you wash off the color guide it really doesnt smell bad. It has an almond-cherry smell when applying and turns into a self tannerish one while it does its magic. It will go away when you shower like normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I apply this with my nightly shower after using my own exfoliator (sugar or salt based) and then going over my entire body with the polish exfoliator in this kit (i really dig exfoliating) after i apply to my whole body starting from my legs up, I let it dry and slip on some loose clothes. I go to bed about and hour or so later with no transfer on my sheets at all. A lot of people in reviews state that they&#x27;ve seen it was off in the shower but I havent really noticed. I exfoliate the next morning and apply the maintainer. My tan is obviously a tad lighter than the night before because of the color guide washing off but I dont really feel as if my tan washed off completely as some people have stated. On my next bottle I am probably going to order the very dark instead of the dark because I want to be super tan and have to apply this less often. I&#x27;ve been applying every other day and in between using the maintainer. On the first say I did this, I did it back to back (shower at night then apply, shower in morning then apply) to build up the tan quicker. My coworkers noticed my tan as soon as I came into work and thought I had spent my days off at the beach :D  I told them about my self tanner and they said it looked natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you exfoliate and rub in the product really well when applying. I do feel hesitant to leave the house with the color guide still on so thats why i choose to do it at night. I feel like the color is better the longer it sits and it looks way more natural after its been washed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the \\&quot;body polish\\&quot; and \\&quot;maintainer\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;they were a good part of the system if you dont own any products at all like this. however if youre strapped for cash you can go ahead and use your own exfoliating product and lotion and just buy the tanner by itself. There isnt really anything special about them. The maintainer smells fresh like a cucumber melon scent and the body polish feels minty kind of.</li>
    <li> The application process does take practice. It makes my skin dark like what I see body builders go for. The exfoliant didn&#x27;t work so well for me. I ended up cleaning my legs with dawn detergent to get a good start. And i found it works better by putting the moisturizer on first before the product. If I dont my legs look like bacon..light in some areas and dark in others.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! Would highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> not at all what I expected did not live up to the hype. Was smelly the day after and not at all natural looking.</li>
    <li> one-way trip. you start using it and then if you stop, your skin turns orange and with spots. hard to remove, might take you weeks of showers.</li>
    <li> While on a jounrney that brought me far, far away from my beloved tanning beds (skin cancer be darned) I noticed the white girl starting to come back out again and missed the loving glow I had with my tan.  After reading some reviews. I went with Sun Labratories lotion set-- couldn&#x27;t have made a better decision!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with a loofah, an exfoliating wash, the tanning lotion, and a tanning extender.  I will say the entire kit and kaboodle itself is a WASTE OF MONEY-- you are fine with just buying the tanning lotion! However, if you want to go the full monty, the exfoliator and tanning extender won&#x27;t hurt you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product leaves a NATURAL looking tan; no worries, it will not turn you orange.  You can control how dark or light you want your tan to be by just re-applying the lotion as necessary; the tan lasts fairly long as well, I was actually impressed.  It doesn&#x27;t wash off too easily, so don&#x27;t be afraid of scrubbing in the tub between applications.  My tan is now fairly dark, and again, it looks totally natural. I have had zero issues with splotches (one caveat, but it was my fault!) or streaks or clumpy spots around joints... and believe me, I&#x27;m pretty retarded when it comes to using beauty products, so if I can do it, you can too :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAVEATS to this product are: please, please, please mix it with your favorite body lotion! The tanning lotion is thick-- which is great, because you can see where you applied it, but if you don&#x27;t rub it in quickly enough like I did on my first application --I put lil globs here and there thinking I would get back to them, and whoops, they kinda set in pretty fast-- you may look like you have spots.  But a quick emergency shower solved that issue.  I typically put it on after I shower for bed-- I&#x27;ve had no issue with the color transferring to my clothes, but I rather not risk it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great, user-friendly product with awesome results.  Again, you don&#x27;t need the entire kit, the tanning lotion sold separately will do just fine, but do not be afraid to try this!!tanning lotion sold separately will do just fine, but do not be afraid to try this!!</li>
    <li> I love sun labs! they have really great quality sunless tanning lotion. Gets me really dark (I&#x27;m irish) and looks natural, never orange. Doesn&#x27;t stink either! Lasts longer than most other brands I&#x27;ve used. Their extending lotion is really great too, as well as the scrub... which is probably my favorite of all! it really gets off all of the color (if you want to remove it) and it exfoliates so well. Love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love!!!!!! I&#x27;ve tried just about everything out there &amp; this is the best!!! I&#x27;m very light with red hair so it takes a lot for me to tan &amp; this works the best!!!!</li>
