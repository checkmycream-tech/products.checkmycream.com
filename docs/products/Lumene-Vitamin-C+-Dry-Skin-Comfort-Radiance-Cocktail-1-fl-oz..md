      <li>If you have normal skin, it&#x27;s way more than you need.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
      <li>It is good for winter when you feel like your face gets so dry..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I first got this on clearance at an Ulta store.  Figured I would give it a try, no matter what type of moisturizer I used or make up I used come any season but summer my skin would get flaky on my forehead, nose through the cheeks and jawline.  I would put lotions (very expensive ones) on throughout the day but it would eventually eliminate my make up, not fix the extremely dry skin and was frustrating.  It even happened if I wasn&#x27;t wearing any make up so I know it wasn&#x27;t just an issue with the make up I was trying!  So I bought this to give it a shot and since it was on clearance it was very cheap.  Boy am I glad I did!  I would gladly pay much more for this product, after only one use the flaky skin was GONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried about it being oily and causing my problem area to break out (basically my chin, the only oily part left on my face).  But, after I applied it I went to do something else for a minute or two and it soaked into my skin and I was able to put my regular face lotion on and proceed to apply my makeup - you can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend putting this on an area of your face that is normally oily as it did cause me to break out on my chin after about a week, but now I use one pump and just apply to the T-zone and my jaw line and it&#x27;s PERFECT.  And this is a good price!  I cannot say enough good things about what this has done, oh, and it&#x27;s got a pleasant smell to it as well - BONUS!</li>
    <li> It is good for winter when you feel like your face gets so dry..&lt;br /&gt;Wash your face and pump one or two times on your palms and massage to your face.</li>
    <li> But, now a believer!  My skin is so dry in winter, I did not think anything could beat coconut oil.  This stuff is even better than that standby!  I use 3 pumps every night. ( I said really dry skin) and my face is soothed and perfect next day!  (I use Lumene time freeze during day).  I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
    <li> It feels and looks great on the skin.  It seems to absorb very quickly and I do not feel like my face is greasy.  I actually prefer putting this on versus any cream that looks white but has 25 ingreedients of some sort.  It looks so clear, natural, and refreshing.</li>
    <li> I have combination/acne prone skin. I have been so nervous to try this since just about everything makes me break out. However, I wish I had used it sooner because it&#x27;s amazing. It definitely helps brighten my skin and it hydrates my skin so I can use my harsh acne products without dryness. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Smells wonderful citrus aroma!</li>
    <li> Love this sutff!  I call it my aging nectar!  I wear it every day...not sticky or greasy like some and I love the compliments on my &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;!  I have used department store products like Lancome and Clinique that have the same results as this product...at 6-8 times the price.  I highly recommend for anyone with dry skin but especially for my over 40 people (like me) who are beginning to show the faint (or not so faint) signs of aging...moisture is key!</li>
    <li> Way too greasy for me and I dont have oily skin...I love the  bright skin version though</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s is not greasy.  My skin can breath in the hot summer.  My skin feels fresher and smooth and glows.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I expected, it s not bad, but a bit greasy yet not hydrating.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, for some reason when i seen it while browsing for some type of face moisturizer ( my skin around my t zone gets dry around the winter) i knew it would be a good buy and the price was not bad at all. so i got and i absolutely love it. i gave it five stars cause it deserves it. i would highly recommend  to anyone needing a little tlc for their skin :)</li>
    <li> Love this product; I use it first thing in the morning, before my day lotion. It makes my skin feel refreshed and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I love it. It smells great (a hint of citrus and sweetness, but not overpowering,(and I am a total werewolf, I am SUPER sensitive to smells) The consistency is water with a little oil, make sure you cup your palm to avoid dripping, just use a tiny bit! A little goes a LONG way. I use two squirts. It covers my whole face and my neck. I just swirl my finger pads in it and lightly rub it in. I do avoid putting too much on my chin and avoid my nose all together. It is very moisturizing and I have big time oily nose. I use this after I use my alpha hydrox treatments. I do not use it every night. Only three to four times a week. But if you have very dry skin or are older (I am 40) then you could probably use it every night. With very dry skin you could probably apply this, wait a little for it to soak in and then use your regular night cream. Oh, and make sure you SHAKE IT before using! It needs to be combined.</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff. I always reorder when I&#x27;m almost out. Feels good, helps to lighten and brighten your skin.</li>
    <li> my wife just loves it...</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd bottle so it means I love it.  I&#x27;ve dry, mature n sensitive skin and will  break out if I use any thing oily.  This is great for me day n nite.  Shake well the bottle, 2 pumps and apply on face and throat.  I don&#x27;t even need any other cream to top it.  Skin feels comfortable.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Great for winter-dry skin. Have not used it long enough to know if it&#x27;s that great for long-term use.</li>
    <li> I have been using thiss product for a long time and it is amazing especialy in summer keeeps the skin moist</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Lumene Vitamin C+ for about 6 months and very impressed with the moisture that has revived in my skin. I recommend it to anyone with dry cracked skin.</li>
    <li> Great seller!&lt;br /&gt;I love this product it absorbs well and goes a long way toward improving overall moisture and radiance for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use and would recommend for dry skin or for use in a steam treatment!</li>
    <li> Wow! I love this serum! It works perfectly over my PTR Turbo serum (I was concerned I would have to alternate products) and before my night and day creams. It does not break me out, as a matter of fact it seems my skin is clearer if anything! Highly recommend this for anyone with dry skin. It does have some fragrance, it smells very lightly of oranges...but it is not overwhelming. An affordable product that delivers on it&#x27;s promises, how&#x27;s that for a refreshing change :)</li>
    <li> I bought  on sale at CVS. I tried it and I love it.  I thought it would be greasy but it&#x27;s not. It makes you face very smooth and hydrated.I know buy all the bottle in stock when it&#x27;s on sale. Highly, Highly  recommend.</li>
    <li> On my second bottle love it! Skin soaks in this vitamin C mixture. Price is kind of high but worth it.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product, I normally use the lumens vital c serum, thought I would switch it up a bit and order this instead, have not use it yet, but shipping was fast .</li>
    <li> I am just using it for 2 days and I love it . My lines under my eyes are almost gone . I have been trying so many products for years and this is the first one that is working . My only complain is the bottle top .It is unscrewing and opening every time I am touching  the top to use it and there are spills no matter how careful I am . Maybe I got a defected one or there is  a need to change  this bottle closing.</li>
    <li> Nothing miraculous,  but it is good mixture that brought some comfort to my combination skin.</li>
    <li> First of all, this is meant for DRY SKIN!!&lt;br /&gt;If you have combination skin, this will grease you up like crazy... UNLESS you use it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin so when im washing my face at night, before i go to bed instead of putting on night cream or moisturizer, i use one small pump of this. Keeps my face feeling fresh, silky and moisturized all night long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product does absorb quickly so be prepared to apply as soon as you dispense it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the price. A little high for my taste but i will continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most amazing facial products I have ever come across. I have extremely dry skin, and when I saw this item on clearance at my local Ulta I was more than willing to give it a try. It has a pleasant light scent, goes smoothly over the skin and absorbs well, and the moisturizing power? WOAH, my face feels normal again! Actually, it feels even better than normal! Soft, supple, smooth.. I&#x27;m starting to wonder now how it would work on the rest of my body. Not to mention, a little goes a long way! I&#x27;ve had the same bottle for over a year and it&#x27;s at about 1/3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face gets very oily in the summertime, and I have learned the hard way that this, even when using the tiniest drop, will worsen oily skin tenfold. So, I stick to using two dime-sized amounts in the dead of winter and a half-dime sized amount in the fall/early winter when my skin is normal to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone with dry skin- If you have normal skin, it&#x27;s way more than you need.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I love this product and my local cvs never has it. so I order it. it leaves my aging combination skin nice with no breakouts.</li>
    <li> i thought this would be greasier/oilier than what it is. make sure you shake the bottle. i apply this before my day cream and my face is moisturized for the day but NOT greasy.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin in the winter; i&#x27;ve tried everything from high end department store brands to drug store and lesser known brands and have always either found the perfumes too much, they&#x27;re too greasy, or just don&#x27;t work.  This, however, works wonders.  It absorbs instantly, is not greasy, and my skin is no longer dry.  I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Use 2 x day with the day and night cream...love</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Lumene Vitamin C + Dry Skin Comfort Radiance for about 2 years now. I can&#x27;t find it in local stores anymore, and it is worth it to me to order it on line. It makes your skin feel quenched, and I live in the high desert of Utah where our humidity is rather low.&lt;br /&gt;If you try it once, you&#x27;ll be hooked!</li>
    <li> It smells good...but it left my skin very greasy and oily looking. I do not like my face looking like that. So I gave it two stars...I will not purchase this product anymore.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  It is really hard to find but you can always count on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Here in Colorado it is dry all the time. This very light oil has saved my skin. It goes on a bit thin and slightly oily but is absorbed by the skin within minutes. I also use it on my dry hands as well on face and neck. Very glad I discovered this skin saver.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, particularly for the price point...though I advise that you shop around. Amazon merchants sell both the old packaging and the new, fancier (and sometimes more expensive) one.  For instance, right now this item is available online or in-stores at CVS for a few bucks cheaper.  As far as the product goes, what I love the most is the all-day dewy glow it gives my skin, but without the greasy, oily feeling.  And the smell is so appealing -- kind of like a creamsicle. The two-toned liquid separates in the jar, so you need to shake it up before each use (I didn&#x27;t understand that at first). A fabulous side benefit is that you can use less cream moisturizer as a result of how much this Lumene product hydrates your skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really haven&#x27;t used this enough to rate it</li>
    <li> I got this on sale at Cvs because I had extremely dry skin due to the winter and it was very greasy and oily. On top of that my skin was still dry but it looked greasy.</li>
    <li> Used product before. Very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> This product works, but you must be patient.  It&#x27;s not an overnight fix, but with everyday use age spots really do appear to lighten up and eventually disappear.</li>
    <li> If you use just a small amount, it will absorb quickly and give your skin a beautifully soft and glowing appearance.</li>
    <li> After reading the other reviews, I had high hopes...  I have incredibly sensitive, dry skin.  This dried it out more...</li>
    <li> Lumene was very popular and trustful brand when I lived in Europe. Now , as I started to use glycolic acid on my skin this cocktail helps me with dry patches on my cheekbones and around nostrils, it freshens the whole face and in the morning the skin looks dewy and fresh, also I noticed that it evens the skin tone. I do not have big problems with it, but still I noticed the difference it made. The smell is nice , very light and it does not cling to you, the texture reminds me two faze eye make up removers, but this one is a bit thicker, not greasy as oil, and does not leave any residue on the skin.It does not clog pores and did not provoke any irritations on my skin, and I have allergic reactions on many cosmetic products. I would not recommend to use it in the morning now, as the days get warmer and skin becomes greasier, at least in my location, but if you use this product in the evening you would avoid extra shine. I am in my mid thirties, and I have a combination skin.I would say the product is competitive with famous department store brands. I would buy more and will buy other products from this series \\&quot;Vitamin C+\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> It does what it says- good product for the cold and windy season!</li>
    <li> Love the feel on my skin.  Product arrived in tact--all good.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and wish it was still on the market  ):</li>
    <li> I used this product when I lived in California&#x27;s Central Valley because it kept my skin consistent in the varied temps of living in a desert climate. It became harder to find the Lumene line in general without the SPF additive so I switched to another line when I moved to Southern California by the beach. Last year I moved to Phoenix, a desert area again with wildly varying temperatures, and I noticed my facial skin this winter was getting red and blistery. The corners of my eyes were even beginning to droop as my skin was becoming tight. I bought this on Nov 26, used it for two days, and my skin is dewey and back to normal. And I am a 51 year old man, so that in itself is a good trick. I hope to be able to continue to find this line without the SPF because I will become a devotee once again.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I can only use once a day because my skin tends to get a little oily.  Feels great!!</li>
    <li> The product came without the dispensing pump - it was just missing!  Fortunately I use this product all the time so I just transferred the cap from an empty one.  It is a wonderful serum - makes your skin feel great.</li>
    <li> great service arrived as promised Thank You</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a skin care junkie! I read all the reviews and have bought very expensive skin care lines. This is an awesome product at an affordable price. People ask me what I use and when I tell them how much I paid for it, they&#x27;re shocked. I use perricone and clarins but I stopped buying the double serum from claims because it was too expensive. An esthectian recommended this to me and I&#x27;m glad she did. I use it in conjunction with the gentle cleansing wipes that they sell. Think you you get results in texture and you will see visible a difference. I used it after a glycolic treatment and saw a drastic difference. It is especially great for someone who has sun damage because you will get a Dewey look to your skin if you use it under moisturizer. I use it day and night and saw remarkable improvement on my neck and chest area. I dint have deep wrinkles so I&#x27;m not sure if this is as effective on someone who has extremely damaged skin due to age or extreme sun damage.</li>
    <li> Lumene, though often a little pricey for a drugstore product, makes a nice and different skin item. It has a gentle glow</li>
    <li> Well, being a Finlander myself, I can only say that these Finlanders really know skin care!  I will be ordering more of this stuff definitely!! It does what it says it does!! Great for fine lines around your eyes!!!</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin moist w/o being greasy and does not clog my pores!</li>
    <li> Over a year ago I was getting a facial, and the esthetician recommended THIS product (which of course the spa didn&#x27;t sell). I was dubious of putting \\&quot;oil\\&quot; on my face, but at the same time, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, especially since someone who wasn&#x27;t even going to get a commission on it made the recommendation. It is amazing. It really moisturizes without feeling heavy like a cream. If you use just a little bit it seeps in and strengthens your skin.</li>
    <li> First I didn&#x27;t receive the dry skin comfort radiance formula. Skin is still dry; no glow after putting it on.</li>
    <li> This oil moisturizers very well. It brightens skin and brings it back to life. Continued use clears spots and gives skin a healthy appearance.</li>
    <li> Since moving to a very dry climate, my skin has been constantly dry. I&#x27;m always on the search for moisturizing products. I&#x27;ve tried expensive products, basic oils and everything in between. This is the very first product to keep my face from flaking; my skin looks so good! Fantastic value for the price.</li>
    <li> The best product ever. Wish it didn&#x27;t cost this much, but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Feels wonderful and soaks into my parched skin within minutes! Four stars instead of five due to about an inch and a half being gone in the bottle when I recieved it...</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! Great product!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best purchases I have made on Amazon!  This little cocktail is a gem for my face!!</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> One of the best treatments I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin.  First purchased at TJ Max for a ridiculously low price, but they don&#x27;t carry items like this on a regular basis.  I then tried Amazon and now I&#x27;m hooked.  Really hydrates the skin and gives it a beautiful glow.  Absolutely love it!!!  LPK - Beauty Product Junkie:-0)</li>
    <li> The product was to oily for my skin.</li>
