      <li>Let me start by saying, \\&quot;Amazon is, what it is:  A great place to get great products.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I also don&#x27;t use the tools so my review is based on what I&#x27;ve experienced on the receiving end</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy that my wife likes the clippers.</li>
      <li>The case is very handy, too.</li>
      <li>Work very nicely.  </li>
      <li>You get good clippers and a great liner.</li>
      <li>For the money, I feel that these are a really good value.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t adjusted the blade on the trimmers yet, so out the box they aren&#x27;t as good as the clippers.</li>
      <li>From experience they are good clippers tho if you keep them oiled</li>
      <li>the is a good set to have in you travel ket.</li>
      <li>great deal and nice product</li>
      <li>Got it on time and as advertised... keep up the good work.</li>
      <li>it LOOK GOOD IN THE PICTURE</li>
      <li>Excellent product for home use, these are perfect for personal grooming.</li>
      <li>Great clippers than many cheaper brand that we have bought.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this tool.</li>
      <li>The clippers cut nice, but the trimmers need to be adjusted, but over all they are a good set.</li>
      <li>When not clipping hair with the PRO PIVOT, you might find any one of our family members styling our newly trimmed hair with our marvelous ANDIS blow drier from their great product line.</li>
      <li>I like that this set includes abundant variable size attachments to meet any haircutting need.  </li>
      <li>Excellent price and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve cut my own hair.</li>
      <li>the clipper by itself is ok, it&#x27;s not the greatest and forget what they say about it does get hot while you use it.</li>
      <li>Great clippers... Have a clean, well trimmed beard every week.</li>
      <li>This set is great for my  moustache and doing those quick haircuts.  </li>
      <li>This is a very nice set of clippers that have worked very well - good motor, good design, easy to use.  </li>
      <li>i love this in every way the packing was exceptional and the deal was even more special would def buy again and again!!</li>
      <li>Both works great, really powerful trimmers...</li>
      <li>I cut my own hair and find, more often than not, that you have to go over the sames spots.  </li>
      <li>No hair pulling and a good clean cut.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t think tapers are very important (or willing to get them separately) and if you&#x27;re willing to edge around the ears by hand, then this is the best combination that I&#x27;ve been able to find for the price.</li>
      <li>and the best thing is you get the trimmers and clippers for the same price.</li>
      <li>ok clippers</li>
      <li>now that are phenomenal, but they also cost almost $200.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;home\\&quot; clipper are cheaper, come with more pieces/accessories</li>
      <li>it gets the job done and he seems to be pleased with it.</li>
      <li>i think your better off investing on the improve master or fade master n a better trimmer.</li>
      <li>I love this set.  </li>
      <li>While this clipper is somewhat quieter and feels better made, the performance is lacking.</li>
      <li>Okay, it does make the cut, but the unit I received also pulls at the hair.  </li>
      <li>but it looks like I will be spending more money on the Andis T-outliner.</li>
      <li>Again Andis has so many to choose from.</li>
      <li>I love these clippers.</li>
      <li>Many attachments for ease of use.  </li>
      <li>But if u want to get a close shave you will have to go with a better product.</li>
      <li>Cons: Packaging could be better; its just a case where you throw the clippers and all attachments.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know what that really means, but IMO it does a great job for close-to-the-skin trimming, so who cares?</li>
      <li>With this set, they now love getting haircuts from Dad.</li>
      <li>This is ok for the price.  </li>
      <li>These work infinitely better than my beard trimmer to give myself haircuts, but they should, shouldn&#x27;t they?  </li>
      <li>I would suggest calibrating the edgers by pushing up the blade for a better line up.</li>
      <li>but it ok</li>
      <li>Also I do want to say that the trimmers work great as long as you use one of the included guards, which is good for touching up your beard or body hair.</li>
      <li>We were pleasantly surprised when we got clippers and trimmer for that price, of quality we were happy with.    </li>
      <li>extremely fast shipping from amazon.. good product.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Overheated and can burn skin easily</li>
      <li>I have had these for over 6 years and they are still going strong.  </li>
      <li>The clippers work great and have no problem clipping off the wiry great strays the old clippers left.</li>
      <li>Nice array of clips and cuts crisply.</li>
      <li>Not bad but measures up to most clippers in this price range.</li>
      <li>it worked perfectly fine and all parts inside.</li>
      <li>The product works fine and havnt had any mechanical problems.  </li>
      <li>They were for the dog, but the quality has been superior and they are 15 years old and still going strong.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t forget to oil them, it makes a huge difference in the cut.  </li>
      <li>I bought this set thinking I get a second pair of the already great clippers and as a bonus get some trimmers/outliners.  </li>
      <li>so the clippers are always running smoothly, and I brush the hair out of the blades about once every three uses.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t to get the clipper oil to keep blades running smoothly.</li>
      <li>This product performs great especially for the price.  </li>
      <li>They will never do for my primary set of clippers.</li>
      <li>Smooth, no draq.  </li>
      <li>The attachments are a light weight plastic, don&#x27;t care for that either.</li>
      <li>Overall great value for the money.</li>
      <li>But so far so good</li>
      <li>Im a professional Barber and these clippers are as good as it gets for the price.</li>
      <li>Overall, a great package that I highly recommend to anyone looking for a high quality package at a great price.</li>
      <li>I got these from warehouse deals, but they are worth it at just about any price!  </li>
      <li>When you use it more than 5 minutes, its blade would be hot.</li>
      <li>These Andis clippers are definitely the best buy we&#x27;ve made thus far.</li>
      <li>clean</li>
      <li>Still, what&#x27;s the point if you can&#x27;t get a clean line?  </li>
      <li>No pulling, clean cut.  </li>
      <li>It is a nice complete set.  </li>
      <li>Oil them and they should last a good while.</li>
      <li>Very unorganized (but most are like this)  </li>
      <li>It is by no means professional clippers, but  if you cut your own hair (like my husband does)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use these about once a month or so. I have to cut my two son&#x27;s hair and my hubby&#x27;s every once in a while. I love these clippers. Easy to use. The boys and dad look great afterwards. I recommend these.</li>
    <li> Purchased this set, because I have purchased Andis before.  They were for the dog, but the quality has been superior and they are 15 years old and still going strong.  This set is great for my  moustache and doing those quick haircuts.  Had rechargeable models before, but give me the cord.  Just plug in and no worries about charging.  Work very nicely.  Don&#x27;t forget to oil them, it makes a huge difference in the cut.  This set gives you everything you need.  It is a nice complete set.  A steal for the price.</li>
    <li> Overheated and can burn skin easily</li>
    <li> Considering that the clippers alone are being sold on Amazon for $39, it was a no-brainier to spend an additional $3 for the trimmers in this combo set. The clippers have worked great by reducing the time I spend cutting my hair in half. They glide over my hair so easily and smoothly without the need to do multiple passes. These clippers aren&#x27;t as loud as my old pair, so for that I like it.    However, the trimmers were a little disappointing because they seem to snag my hair and bite my skin quite a bit. I haven&#x27;t adjusted the blade on the trimmers yet, so out the box they aren&#x27;t as good as the clippers. Also I do want to say that the trimmers work great as long as you use one of the included guards, which is good for touching up your beard or body hair.</li>
    <li> I like to keep my hair cut short (#2 or #1). I thought that it would save time and money getting a set of clippers that I could use at home. These clippers work great. I buzz cut my hair with these clippers, and my wife does touch up and trim with the trimmers. The clippers get a little warm by the time I am done buzzing my hair, but not hot. I have not experienced any pulling of my hair or nicking with these clippers. For the money, I feel that these are a really good value.</li>
    <li> Very good quality for the money. I have only used it a handful of times but so far I&#x27;m extremely happy with the purchase.Did not find it noisy as one person has stated.Overall great value for the money.</li>
    <li> This product performs great especially for the price.  The trimmers might not cut as close as one might expect and for that reason I would still recommend keeping some small edgers around for detailed facial hair.  For the price, the Andis Brand, and the quality for 2 pair of clippers definitely worth the purchase price.</li>
    <li> Bought this set as hopefully an upgrade to a lower end set bought in store for much less. I have been a little disappointed. While this clipper is somewhat quieter and feels better made, the performance is lacking. Does not cut and better and is a little rougher on the scalp than other cheaper clipper by a different brand. Overall it works ok, just not as well as i had hoped/expected it would. Oh well...would not recomend</li>
    <li> The clippers are very dull and pull your hair instead of cutting the hair. I would not purchase this brand of clippers again.</li>
    <li> I think it is OK, but is not perfect. When you use it more than 5 minutes, its blade would be hot.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice set of clippers that have worked very well - good motor, good design, easy to use.  They&#x27;re a big upgrade from the battery powered and rechargeable trimmers I&#x27;ve used in the past, including lighter-duty plug-in models.  Well worth the investment, especially because they&#x27;re only a bit more expensive (perhaps $10) than much less capable models.    Two very small complaints:  - The small bottle of clipper oil included in the box leaked once it had been opened, it wasn&#x27;t designed well.    - I wish there were some clip or storage system to keep the combs organized - they sit in the included pouch and I have to sort through them every time I want to change lengths.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying, \\&quot;Amazon is, what it is:  A great place to get great products.\\&quot; Each of the products that I&#x27;ve bought from Amazon have been knock-offs. That is, imitations of branded products. And that&#x27;s cool for certain purchases: a charger, iPod accessories..., but not hair clippers! This product will decapitate you. I have been cutting my own hair and have owned my own set of clippers for the past 25 years. For much of the past 15, my clippers have been, Andis Professional, Pivot Master, blah, blah, blah. These are not those clippers. Dead giveaways: the gold, \\&quot;Made in China\\&quot; plug, ( The real is silver). The cord is too light in weight and the blades are dull (too squared). Both, the clippers and trimmers crash and burn.  I tried to use them, had to stop during the cut, and go buy the real ones. They will never do for my primary set of clippers. Maybe for a dog. I returned them for \\&quot;quality issues.\\&quot; You have to pay for the quality you want. $50 retail isn&#x27;t bad. My last pair lasted four years. Cutting three heads weekly, the occasional favor, and shaving daily with the clippers (yes! My blades were dull as #£&amp;@!). These are bad clippers. A cheap imitation of what is advertised. \\&quot;Steer Clear. It is, what is.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Im doing this add for this product ive only used it once or had them on my head once fabulous product.....</li>
    <li> The clippers are great! No hair pulling and a good clean cut.  I had this same pair for about 5 years now so I give them 5 STARS.  BUT the trimmer/outliner is the bad part of the deal.  I bought this set thinking I get a second pair of the already great clippers and as a bonus get some trimmers/outliners.  Unfortunately the bonus is not a bonus at all.  If you are needing an outliner stay away from these ones and pay for the Andis T-outliners.  Those are the way to go. Thought i was saving money buying this set but it looks like I will be spending more money on the Andis T-outliner.</li>
    <li> Awesome quality clipper pair.  Quiet and powerful.  Many attachments for ease of use.  I expect these will last many years.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t really beat this package. You get good clippers and a great liner. The liners are basically the andis t-outliners but you have to adjust them. I highly recommend this package.</li>
    <li> These clippers are decent. The edgers vibrate a lot when you use them though. They aren&#x27;t very sharp either. I would suggest calibrating the edgers by pushing up the blade for a better line up. As for the clippers, they cut pretty smooth.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy using my new trimmers. The service was great! Got it on time and as advertised... keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> I purchased this haircut kit because I had been shipping all aroung for one for my son and husband. I decided to go with this one trusting seller reviews, and low and behold....THEY LIED! I did NOT receive a NEW hair kit as stated I would get! The clippers had hair and oil on them.....Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is ok for the price.  I though i would get a closer fave with the trimmer but that wasnt the case.  The product works fine and havnt had any mechanical problems.  But if u want to get a close shave you will have to go with a better product.</li>
    <li> Im a professional Barber and these clippers are as good as it gets for the price. They dont heat up quick, are lightweight and very quiet. I use them on a daily basis and they are an excellent back up pair to your master clippers.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for home use, these are perfect for personal grooming.</li>
    <li> Since there&#x27;s no need to talk about how much money you can save by cutting your own hair (or having someone cut it for you), let&#x27;s cut to the chase...    I don&#x27;t even remember the last time I went to a barber shop. I&#x27;ve always had my hair cut by my mother and now, for the past 5-years, my girlfriend. This review will not be from a professional stand-point, so please keep that in mind. I also don&#x27;t use the tools so my review is based on what I&#x27;ve experienced on the receiving end and comments by the two people above.    Before I get started, let me just say that in my weeks of research I&#x27;ve learned that the difference between high-end and low-end models of professional clippers is noise, how cool they stay and motor power/rpm (all should have swappable blades). Besides various attachments, which are practically the same with all trimmers, that&#x27;s the difference you&#x27;re paying for in price. Now that I&#x27;ve explained the professional clippers, I just want to say that all of my previous experience was with cheapo \\&quot;home\\&quot; versions. The \\&quot;home\\&quot; clipper are cheaper, come with more pieces/accessories but they also don&#x27;t last as long, feel cheap, sometimes they rip out hair and don&#x27;t cut as quickly.    We&#x27;ve had Oster professional clippers for our dog for about 8-years now that are phenomenal, but they also cost almost $200. After going through so many home versions of clippers, we&#x27;ve finally decided to get professional quality clippers based on experience with the aforementioned model. Our budget was approximately $50 for clippers only. We were pleasantly surprised when we got clippers and trimmer for that price, of quality we were happy with.    These Andis clippers are definitely the best buy we&#x27;ve made thus far. They cut very quickly, so my cut time was shaved by at least 5-minutes. Even going at faster speeds I never felt like my hairs were being pulled. The trimmer/edger on the other hand, although it did a great job of the neck-line is a bit wide for edging around the ears.Scissors still had to be used for that. However my girlfriend liked this Andis Professional combination over everything we&#x27;ve used previously. We kept the trimmer for the neck.    Pros:  - Professional quality w/fast &amp; powerful motor  - Should hopefully last much longer than our older \\&quot;home\\&quot; versions  - Makes short time of clipping (no hair pulling!)  - Trimmer does a great job with the neck and sideburns edging  - Clipper has a great \\&quot;feel\\&quot; in small and large hands  - 1/16th to 1\\&quot; attachments  Cons:  - Clippers are slightly loud (no biggie though)  - Edger is too wide for edging around ears  - No taper (side/fade) attachment for clipper or trimmer    The reason I gave a 4-star review is because of the few shortcomings that I listed in the cons (I&#x27;d give 4.5 if available). However, having said that, you&#x27;d be very hard pressed to find a better clipper/trimmer combination. If you don&#x27;t think tapers are very important (or willing to get them separately) and if you&#x27;re willing to edge around the ears by hand, then this is the best combination that I&#x27;ve been able to find for the price. This is definitely a quality product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers for my wife to shear me off monthly. I do not have that much hair these days. The clippers work great and have no problem clipping off the wiry great strays the old clippers left. The blades got a little hot before I remembered to use a drop of 3-in-1 oil before each use. I&#x27;m happy that my wife likes the clippers. I thought the price was reasonable too.</li>
    <li> extremely fast shipping from amazon.. good product. beard trimmer is pretty sharp compared to other products.. 4/5 stars..</li>
    <li> These have little power, I have gone back to my old set because they just don&#x27;t cut the hair well. The attachments are a light weight plastic, don&#x27;t care for that either.</li>
    <li> Works real well for the price of a haircut. Smooth, no draq.  Sharp makes nice cuts.  I am very pleased with this tool.</li>
    <li> Poorly constructed, seams on plastic housing were very jagged and uncomfortable to hold and the clippers made a very loud rattling noise while cutting.</li>
    <li> These clippers get too hot after a few minutes of use. I also noticed that these don&#x27;t cut as close as Wahl Senior series clippers.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done. Even better with a few adjustments. Oil them and they should last a good while.</li>
    <li> Not only was this product recommended to me by my husband&#x27;s barber, but my husband says it&#x27;s the most even shave he&#x27;s been able to get in a long time.  The razors on the liners did need to be adjusted right away, but they worked as expected.  It was worth the difference to buy the combo.</li>
    <li> excellent buy  ..great deal and nice product i love this in every way the packing was exceptional and the deal was even more special would def buy again and again!!</li>
    <li> ok clippers i got what i paid for. it get the job done. cut clean smooth but heats up pretty quick. trimmer sucks period doesn&#x27;t cut. i think your better off investing on the improve master or fade master n a better trimmer. just my opinion.</li>
    <li> The only complaint I can think of is it took a little while to get delivered.  Other than that it was exactly as advertised. Used it twice so far so the real test will be seeing if it holds up. But so far so good</li>
    <li> i bought this clipper set i thought i wasgoing to enjoy but big misatake. the clipper by itself is ok, it&#x27;s not the greatest and forget what they say about it does get hot while you use it. but the outliner is a lame excuse for a product it can&#x27;t cut at first i thought the one i had was defective but they replace it for me same result it&#x27;s just not good please stay away from that set you will be disapointed like me</li>
    <li> These are the quietest Andis clippers I have ever owned and I can&#x27;t imagine how I got along without them.  They are smooth and work fast on coarse hair.  I got these from warehouse deals, but they are worth it at just about any price!  They aren&#x27;t as close as T-liners by Andis, but you get a pretty close cut with two sets of clippers for about half the price.</li>
    <li> This is my second clipper purchase.  The first was a cordless beard trimmer years ago.  These work infinitely better than my beard trimmer to give myself haircuts, but they should, shouldn&#x27;t they?  No pulled hairs, clean, sharp cuts, plenty of hair-depth attachments, and two units for the price of one!  The only questionable thing about this duo is I think the trimmer unit doesn&#x27;t sound as high-pitched (the blades are moving slower?) as the ones I&#x27;ve heard professional barbers use. Don&#x27;t know what that really means, but IMO it does a great job for close-to-the-skin trimming, so who cares?</li>
    <li> I would recommend this item to you in a heartbeat.  I have no issues with it whatsoever.  The clippers work very well....and the best thing is you get the trimmers and clippers for the same price.</li>
    <li> Simply I am waiting for this new order but have had the Andis T outliner which I spent over 200 bucks for and it lasted 4 years great  so I hope these two last me a few months haha !</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I have had these for over 6 years and they are still going strong.  The only thing I can say negative about them is that the start switch is right where you hold it and you either turn it off or on when you don&#x27;t want to.  The hair length attachments are not very good quality.  Other than that if you know how to take care of clippers it should last you a long time.</li>
    <li> Not bad but measures up to most clippers in this price range. Not really better or worse.    Pros: Smooth cutting action, (but it&#x27;s a new blade)    Cons: Packaging could be better; its just a case where you throw the clippers and all attachments. Very unorganized (but most are like this)  No scissors/comb for touch up.  Trimmer is no real bonus, Clippers do a better job for close cut. Small trimmer actually hurts a little.    BOTTOM LINE: Don&#x27;t spend the $40 on this, go with the Andis $25-$29 one. You don&#x27;t need the trimmer, plus the clipper only one comes with scissors and comb. Save the $10.</li>
    <li> Professional quality, easy to use, does the job right.  Nice array of clips and cuts crisply.</li>
    <li> I ordered these but never received them but it ok because amazon refund&lt;br /&gt;def my $ no questions asked. From experience they are good clippers tho if you keep them oiled n clean I am a barber there not my first choice but my cheapest choice.</li>
    <li> I love this set.  Works great.  No pulling, clean cut.  The trimmer are a little loud but well worth it.</li>
    <li> It stop working after three months.</li>
    <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve owned in the 30+ years I&#x27;ve cut my own hair.</li>
    <li> The item purchased has met all my expectations, and I would gladly purchase this item again in the very near future.</li>
    <li> Spend your money on another set. They&#x27;re loud and vibrate like nobodies business. But they do cut hair. I kept my set but after 3-4 uses, I would not buy them all over again.</li>
    <li> clippers get really hot.</li>
    <li> Tried it as soon as I got it and it worked well. I would recommend it to someone but they will also need the outliner.</li>
    <li> Both works great, really powerful trimmers...no complaints!!!</li>
    <li> My family really likes this product! Our old clipper have had it and we needed some new ones. These clippers work very well.</li>
    <li> This is a great high-quality set. I owned cheaper hairclippers and comparatively speaking to this product, they were cheap and wonky. The larger buzzer feels very smooth and way quieter than the others I&#x27;ve used. I usually buzz my own hair, but the main reason I bought this set was because I now give my young sons haircuts and they are super-sensitive to the blade when I would do the trimming around the ears and back. With this set, they now love getting haircuts from Dad. One last thing that should be noted, that the description doesn&#x27;t mention is that the package comes with attachments for both buzzers. The case is very handy, too. Overall, a great package that I highly recommend to anyone looking for a high quality package at a great price.</li>
    <li> these clipper and trimmers do not cut close enough to the skin if you desire to do so.   they do not adjust to shave hair at the skin level at all.</li>
    <li> Okay, it does make the cut, but the unit I received also pulls at the hair.  I&#x27;ve cut my husband and sons&#x27; hair for years and this is the first time the experience has been unpleasant for them.  I found the final result to be uneven, though I was able to remedy that with scissors.  Still, what&#x27;s the point if you can&#x27;t get a clean line?  Also, I would like a guard with a taper for around the ears.  With two rounds of cuts on 3 guys, we didn&#x27;t lose money on this, but I&#x27;m back to searching for a better clipper.</li>
    <li> I will keep this short, there \\&quot;AWESOME\\&quot; and work better than advertised. Its a two clipper set, trimmer and clipper. Both units are very powerfull and get the job done.</li>
    <li> Great product. the first one i ordered had a few parts missing, i contacted amazon and they sent a new one. it worked perfectly fine and all parts inside. i use the machine daily and it stands up to pressure. i definitely recommend it</li>
    <li> Great buy. Use it very often. Have no complaints about it. Excellent price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> the is a good set to have in you travel ket. The clippers cut nice, but the trimmers need to be adjusted, but over all they are a good set.</li>
    <li> Initially I bought it for the close trimmer, but the clipper was extra. It works well for the value. Again Andis has so many to choose from. A little hard on the face, but your face will get use to it.</li>
    <li> Great clippers than many cheaper brand that we have bought. Do a great job of cutting hair and trimming.</li>
    <li> Small clippers don&#x27;t get close enough</li>
    <li> this product cuts way smoother than any other clipper I have used. i recommend them to any parent who cuts their kids hair or any professional looking for an inexpensive pair of high quality clippers.</li>
    <li> I bought this over a year ago, and now feel prepared to write a proper review.  Both clippers are a little on the loud side, which is not that big of a deal.  The larger clipper is fairly durable, but you will need multiple passes to get an even cut.  I cut my own hair and find, more often than not, that you have to go over the sames spots.  I have medium (not coarse, not fine) hair and I don&#x27;t use it anymore.  If you are looking for a longer cut, and are cutting someone else&#x27;s hair, it will work well.  I do like the adjustable blade and varying lengths of attachments.    I like the smaller trimmer much better.  I also like the attachments that come with the smaller clipper, however, this one is much louder than the first. A drawback with the trimmer follows what has been mentioned before, the head is a bit on the large size, and that makes it hard to trim around the ear.  The blades are not adjustable, but the attachments work very well with this one.    If you are cutting someone else&#x27;s hair, I would recommend this as it is a good price for two decent clippers, however, if you cut your own hair, very short, I would not buy this.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s NOT WORKING  it LOOK GOOD IN THE PICTURE BUT IT DID NOT MEET MY REQUIREMENTS. I will also like to cancel my Membership.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always bought the big box store clippers which do fine for awhile, then tried to change the blades and they never quite work the same.  Both of these clippers are fantastically built, solid, professional.  I don&#x27;t believe I will ever need another set.  But if I do, I willl buy these again!</li>
    <li> pulls some hairs. other than that, ok so far. i would recommend this product for anyone looking for a midrange clipper combo</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t complain, shipment was on time as promised and clippers continue to perform as well as hoped...no issues to-date several months after purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased these from amazon 2.5 years ago now. These puppies are the THE BEST. When I don&#x27;t have time to shave and my beard grows in, I use the trimmer to trim before shaving! I use the trimmer at least once a week, and I used to buzz my head twice a month with the big clippers. I have naturally oily hair so the clippers are always running smoothly, and I brush the hair out of the blades about once every three uses. I think I&#x27;m gonna buy another set in the future in case they ever stop making these! haha</li>
    <li> I have been cutting our family&#x27;s hair for over 30 years.  I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands of clippers, however the ANDIS PRO PIVOT HAIR CLIPPER AND TRIMMER has proved the best so far.  In fact, I just received my second set as a Christmas gift, promptly forwarding the old set to my sons, who now clip their own hair.  I like that this set includes abundant variable size attachments to meet any haircutting need.  I also like that this set includes TWO SEPARATE units consisting of one standard type &amp;#34;clipper&amp;#34; and one slightly smaller &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; (which is great for maneuvering around ears, cutting sideburns, close trimming around nape of neck, and in my youngest son&#x27;s case, closely grooming and taming his rather &amp;#34;wild&amp;#34; eyebrows).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While getting somewhat warm to the touch during extended use (2-3 back-to-back haircuts), they have never gotten too hot to handle, as has been the case with some other brands.  I don&#x27;t really care for the black bag-type storage case that comes with these clippers, however that was easily remedied with purchase of a hard plastic carrying case with handle and sufficient room/divided compartments for all of the accompanying attachments, plus storage for an extension cord and barber cape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trust ANDIS products.  They are a quality brand that our family uses daily.  When not clipping hair with the PRO PIVOT, you might find any one of our family members styling our newly trimmed hair with our marvelous ANDIS blow drier from their great product line.</li>
    <li> Should have bought the Masters.</li>
    <li> For the price you are getting a decent product. It is by no means professional clippers, but  if you cut your own hair (like my husband does) it gets the job done and he seems to be pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Great clippers... Have a clean, well trimmed beard every week. Don&#x27;t to get the clipper oil to keep blades running smoothly. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the #0 clip fits a bit big or slanted but other than that it definitely gets the job done.</li>
