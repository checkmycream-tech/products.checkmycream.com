      <li>Is exactly what I needed.  </li>
      <li>Product works exactly as described.</li>
      <li>This mirror is exactly as it&#x27;s described.  </li>
      <li>I could see both eyes, and I could focus on one eye with that same eye, but could feel my &#x27;off&#x27; eye roving around trying to get comfortable, and it couldn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>If you want to see your whole face</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think its a real glass mirror, though.</li>
      <li>(a) affordable  (b) a high magnification level  </li>
      <li>(c) a large mirror surface (so I can use both eyes), and  (d) ships directly from Amazon</li>
      <li>To bad Because it was perfect for us until the day It fell apart.</li>
      <li>The other side still is fine, we might re-glue it.</li>
      <li>It looks like they only use three spots of Hot glue so after about a year one side of the mirror came unglued fell out an broke because its glass.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s a great magnification level, but it&#x27;s only about the size of a post-it note, so I can only work by closing the &#x27;off&#x27; eye, putting the other eye in the center of the mirror, and applying my makeup to that eye.  </li>
      <li>Swissco Clear Acrylic Hand Held Mirro  1X/10X&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>

      <li>Finally a decent hand mirror that&#x27;s large enough to see my entire face!</li>
      <li>one side magnifies, one regular, hole in the handle big enough to hang on my old fashioned brass towel hook</li>

<li> one side magnifies, one regular, hole in the handle big enough to hang on my old fashioned brass towel hook</li>
<li> The ten times magnification is so huge that it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to see what you&#x27;re doing.  </li>

<li> This mirror unfortunately has confirmed this.</li>

<li> (a minor consideration</li>

<li> I bought 4 mirrors and hence money wasted as i could not use them as gifts.&lt;br</li>
<li> i use it every day, and i would recommend it to anyone who has trouble seeing.</li>
<li> This mirror is a little on the small side, but the 10X lets me see things I didn&#x27;t even know</li>
<li> The image on the non-magnified side is slightly distorted, which makes it difficult to see the back of your head.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a small mirror</li>
<li> The magnification side has a small sticker towards the bottom saying &amp;#34;10XMagnification&amp;#34; so I immediately know which side is which.  </li>

<li> existed (a little scary).</li>
<li> Unfortunately, with my eyes as bad as they are, a 10x is just not good enough.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have a 12x Tweezerman-brand mirror that I have been using to apply makeup without my glasses.  And it&#x27;s a great magnification level, but it&#x27;s only about the size of a post-it note, so I can only work by closing the &#x27;off&#x27; eye, putting the other eye in the center of the mirror, and applying my makeup to that eye.  A nuisance.  This Swissco mirror was the only one I could find that was:    (a) affordable  (b) a high magnification level  (c) a large mirror surface (so I can use both eyes), and  (d) ships directly from Amazon so I get Prime shipping :-) (a minor consideration and I see it is no longer available from Amazon).    Unfortunately, with my eyes as bad as they are, a 10x is just not good enough.  I could see both eyes, and I could focus on one eye with that same eye, but could feel my &#x27;off&#x27; eye roving around trying to get comfortable, and it couldn&#x27;t.  This will do for emergencies, but I&#x27;m off to find a 12 or 15x handheld that I can afford.    Just FYI, my reading glass prescription is +2.00.  I do wear prescription glasses, but if you want to compare how this mirror might work for you, the reading glass thing is a guideline.</li>
    <li> This mirror is a little on the small side, but the 10X lets me see things I didn&#x27;t even know existed (a little scary). Good quality glass.</li>
    <li> Works as it should. one side magnifies, one regular, hole in the handle big enough to hang on my old fashioned brass towel hook</li>
    <li> Is exactly what I needed.  Allows multi-function, 1 side for putting on makeup w/o using my glasses.  Other side for everything else.</li>
    <li> The mirror works fine but it is too small, the actual mirror surface is around 5 inches or less in diameter.&lt;br /&gt;Once again I have been fooled by the picture.</li>
    <li> This is my ideal hand mirror.  The handle is slim and easy to hold.  The mirror is a good size but light weight to hold for any length of time.  The quality of the glass mirror is excellent, giving true to life reflection.  The magnification side has a small sticker towards the bottom saying &amp;#34;10XMagnification&amp;#34; so I immediately know which side is which.  The clear Lucite styling is classic and would go with most dressing tables or counter tops.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> After I visited a hotel with one of these maginfying mirrors in the bathroom, I wanted to have one.  This works ok, but I should have went for the higher magnification.  But this item is good for the cost.</li>
    <li> If your eyesight is not as good as it used to be this mirror is a must have.  Bought my first one in the USA and so pleased I was able to get one online for my sister.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried to break it yet, but it is very clear, a good size, and  (not that I need it) but the 10X side - you can see every black head and cratter on your face-scary.</li>
    <li> Product works exactly as described. It&#x27;s a small mirror but it does the job. It&#x27;s a good product for the price.</li>
    <li> I hate this mirror - it magnifies so strong that you can see every blemish, line and imperfection!  I hate it - hate it - hate it!  I would recommend everyone get one!  I know you&#x27;ll hate it as much as I!</li>
    <li> I am an aging male 60+ and wanted to see if my hair was fading in the back.  This mirror unfortunately has confirmed this. good weight, good construction good optical properties.</li>
    <li> We kept this in the shower for my husband to use while shaving.  Despite several drops and knocking it over multiple times, the mirror lasted 4 plus years before one side of the mirror fell off, but no cracks.  The other side still is fine, we might re-glue it.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for someone who liked the old but not so good one that I have&lt;br /&gt;had for years.  As soon as my old one breaks (not too likely) or I get tired of&lt;br /&gt;it -  I will buy one of these for me!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this mirror both at home and when traveling as it fits nicely in my luggage and is lightweight.  Great for both putting on make up and plucking eyebrows.  If you want to see your whole face then I would suggest going 5x instead of 10x magnification.  Could not find the stand in the box but then it may have gotten thrown out accidentally so I cannot comment as to whether it works.</li>
    <li> Finally a decent hand mirror that&#x27;s large enough to see my entire face! The other side is a regular mirror. I would be lost without it.</li>
    <li> boght for my 3 year old daughter to be able to see her new earings, and its safe for her to use cause it doesnt break</li>
    <li> It looks like they only use three spots of Hot glue so after about a year one side of the mirror came unglued fell out an broke because its glass. If it would&#x27;ve hit the carpet it may have lived but the piece fell into the sink of course and broke into a half dozen pieces. The handle is acrylic but the mirrors are glass which is a good thing. To bad Because it was perfect for us until the day It fell apart. Since we do like it and it is perfect for us I&#x27;m gonna buy another one and this time I&#x27;m going to beef it up with better glue more appropriate for glass like rubberized silicon.</li>
    <li> I needed a new magnifying mirror to apply my make up (especially eye liner) and this has worked great.  I would recommend this for anyone.  It&#x27;s light and you can see everything up close;even things you might not want to see.</li>
    <li> For the money, this mirror is just OK.  I don&#x27;t think its a real glass mirror, though. The image on the non-magnified side is slightly distorted, which makes it difficult to see the back of your head.  The 10x side works well tho.</li>
    <li> Swissco Clear Acrylic Hand Held Mirro  1X/10X&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Arrived early (Amazon Prime)&lt;br /&gt;  Light weight, easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;  10X MAGNIFIES!  Revealed facial hairs I never realized were visible!  YIKES!&lt;br /&gt;  Mirror will easily travel in my luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!  (o:</li>
    <li> Great price and love the low weight of the mirror, it doesn&#x27;t strain my hand to hold it for long periods of time.  My mirror over time has picked up marks and \\&quot;bits\\&quot; that don&#x27;t seem to come off with regular household cleaner, I wish that it were a solid color so it doesn&#x27;t show it so easily.</li>
    <li> I had trouble finding a mirror to leave out on my guest bathroom counter.  I like this one because it is clear and kind of just disappears,and doesn&#x27;t compete with the decor. And it isn&#x27;t too big and bulky.</li>
    <li> Nice and fresh-looking mirror, not too heavy, and also very handy.  It is definitely of good quality, well-made, and feels good in the hand.</li>
    <li> Only the magnifying side of the mirror can be used. The other side is distorted. I bought 4 mirrors and hence money wasted as i could not use them as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;It is too costly to return the goods as i am  in Australia and Amazon will only compensates a fraction of the shipping return cost.</li>
    <li> i  have very poor eyesight, so i need a magnified mirror to put on makeup. this mirror is perfect for that.  i use it every day, and i would recommend it to anyone who has trouble seeing.</li>
    <li> This mirror is exactly as it&#x27;s described.  It will serve its purpose with me.  The only thing I wish was a little different is I wish the actual mirror was a little bigger.</li>
    <li> This mirror was just what I was looking for in the Balto. Md area but I could not find it locally.</li>
    <li> THIS MIRROR LETS ME SEE THINGS THAT OTHER MIRRORS CAN&#x27;T. I LOVE THIS MIRROR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH!</li>
    <li> As expected. I can see the back of my hair!</li>
    <li> The 10x side is blurry and not very clear. I have had these before and this is my least favorite. I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> The ten times magnification is so huge that it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to see what you&#x27;re doing.  I sent it back at once.</li>
