<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Does not irritate my very sensitive skin, no breakouts, just smooth, soft clean skin.  If you use the soap in direct contact with you skin the scent will last on your skin just about all day - will not last as long using soap on a washcloth, but you&#x27;ll be just as clean and skin as soft. I now order this directly from the Plantlife website, $4.95/bar and free shipping on orders $20&amp;#62;, CHEAPER than Amazon- Also, Amazon offers &amp;#34;Free Shipping&amp;#34; on this for over $35 orders, but the price of the soap goes up $1.  News Flash Amazon- that isn&#x27;t FREE SHIPPING!  It&#x27;s PRICE GOUGING!  Like the owner of Amazon doesn&#x27;t have enough freakin&#x27; money.</li>
    <li> This soap smells wonderful and leaves a lasting fragrance on your skin.  Soap can be used for more than bathing. One holistic use for soap is to lubricate wooden drawers that stick or squeak. Rubbing this bar on the areas of the drawer where friction occurs will reduce the friction, and produce a pleasant fragrance whenever the drawer is opened.</li>
    <li> I have no idea how anyone can not love the smell of this soap. Yes, it&#x27;s not pure sandalwood, but that&#x27;s what I love... it smells like an amazing, sweet incense from an Indian temple or something. The spikenard, frankincense etc all add to the spiritual, lingering gorgeousness of this fragrance. I want to write a poem about this soap, I love it so much. When I wake up and use this soap (which by the way, the particles in it are not \\&quot;dirt,\\&quot; they are exfoliating ground up resins, and the reason the soap is soft is because it is produced the traditional way, retaining the natural glycerin) I feel soothed and comforted, and I know the day is going to be OK. It is almost like a mini meditation in a bar. I also love the fact that the scent lingers on me all day. It is not heavy and overpowering like pure sandalwood is to me, it is sweet and subtle, almost churchy (from the frankincense). It just has such a spiritual scent and it doesn&#x27;t fade like many natural soap smells do. It also is wonderfully moisturizing and exfoliating. I came here looking to buy this by the case. ;)</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.  Very nice scent.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with this soap.  Not only is the sandalwood aroma great, but the granular texture gives my skin a good rub down while I bathe.  I really like this soap!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap! It also has exfoliants that feel great, very refreshing! I will be buying this soap again!</li>
    <li> The square bar is too large for the normal hand, but the bar wears down quickly so it&#x27;s not really an issue.  It also leaves sandy grains in the bottom of the shower from the exfoliants, which feels like you are scratching your skin.  Skin feels good after a shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered from Plantlife several times. And ALWAYS they send you a free sample of something, they&#x27;re super fast and everything is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I am a hillbilly-hippy with a real appreciation for a premium herbal scent and I love bathing in this stuff. I get alot of compliment&#x27;s by the ladies on how good I smell too. If you have a passion for herbal soaps this is the good stuff.   Plantlife products impress me.</li>
    <li> The sandalwood scent is strong, but not overpowering. It is amazingly woody and appealing, and lingers on your skin after you bathe. The texture itself is a bit softer than a commercial soap. I love this soap, and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Noted that sandalwood was listed as no. 10 in list of 12 ingredients.  Not much essence of sandalwood comes through when showering with it.</li>
    <li> Sandlewood is my favorite scent and I like buying natural soaps.  However I get tired of paying for increasingly smaller bars and high prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while this soap is nice, I buy it by the 22oz LOAF (my choice of scent) at thesoapguy dot com for the same price as this 4oz product.  Every SMALL LOAF an be cut into 6 individual bars of soap.  Every large LOAF can be cut into 10 individual bars of soap.  A  Their bulk buy individual soap bars are bigger and cheaper also.  I stock up and give them as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;See my comment for price break down.</li>
    <li> I ordered this soap for my sister, and she says it&#x27;s \\&quot;Delicious!\\&quot;, with a long-lasting scent.I don&#x27;t think there was any info lacking in the description of the product,that&#x27;s why I chose it immediately as what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied, but I wish the scent was a little stronger.  Also the shape is a little awkward and doesn&#x27;t fit on my soapdish very well. Other than that, I&#x27;m happy with the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/4/13 After using my second bar I would like to say that I think this is my favorite soap.  It lasts a long time and I just cut it in half and leave one half by the sink and the other half in the shower.  I guess I wish the scent was stronger because I love it so much.</li>
    <li> I was intrigued by the reference to \\&quot;sandalwood\\&quot; fragrance in several novels I  had read - of all things - which stimulated me to go looking for some to try myself.  I launched an intensive search, and after spending far too long on Google and Amazon comparing bars of sweet soap, I selected this one for the maiden voyage into the exotic and the unknown due to several factors, one of which was that it was portrayed as 100% natural, which i hoped meant just what it said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a soft soap that readily dissolves, perhaps too quickly because a lot of it ends up in the bottom of the dish after it meets the water, but I was prepared for this effect.  I had taken the \\&quot;one bar\\&quot; order since I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would want the whole box - and this might be the best way if you are experimenting like I was.  It was indeed a fine fragrance, but it was slightly more concentrated than I wanted.  For my tastes, a lighter toned bar with less intensity would be more to my liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for those with a flair for the exotic, this earthy, woodsy bar would be a good choice because while it is definite and lasting, it is not overpowering and the reasons for choosing a soap fragrance in the first place is to enjoy the sense of it lingering after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you comparing, there is a small company \\&quot;Tumbleweed Soap Company\\&quot; (also found on Amazon)  that does a great job with their soap, and some of it did contain a hint of sandalwood which was just right - so I may review for that company too.</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling sandalwood soap that I have found. The smell of the bar is strong. Its lather and after feel top notch. My only complaint is that it only leaves a faint hint of sandalwood on my skin. It&#x27;s soap after all, not cologne.</li>
    <li> Good soap. Nice natural  fragrance. Not overpowering. It does not stink up the whole house. I like to give it as a gift. My wife is not crazy about the square corners but that is what real soap looks like because originally it was left to set in a pan and is cut to squares rather than injection molded.</li>
    <li> THis is the best smelling soap on the planet! Woodsy, earthy and totally natural it cleans well and rinses well. Its the only soap I use. SOOOOOOO GOOD!</li>
    <li> Great smell and feels so good on skin...not sticky and chalky like most other soaps...wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this soap. I feel really clean and does not dry out my skin. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> This product was one of many in a birthday basket. I have not heard anything negative from the person who received the basket therefore, I am assuming it was good.</li>
    <li> I am broadening my horizons and experimenting with certain products.  I am very happy with this merchandise.  I liked it so much I have purchased more of the same.</li>
    <li> I love buying this soap for my boyfriend. It smells great!</li>
    <li> I love the fact that it is completely natural and the fragrance lasts fore a very long  time. I would like more sandlewood products.</li>
    <li> excellent soap met all expectations</li>
    <li> Wonderfully scented soap with natural ingredients that doesn&#x27;t overpower the senses. Great lasting power, and suds up well. Will definitely purchase more in the line.</li>
    <li> I like the scent. It doesn&#x27;t lather as well as I&#x27;d like but that may just be a personal preference. OK soap. Might try something else next time.</li>
    <li> this is some great soap.  i bought this out of curiosity and was pleasantly surprised.  incredible fragrance, long lasting.  if i were to make any criticism it would be the bars shape.  i would much rather it be rectangular than square.  this would not deter me from buying it again.  a very good quality product.  i will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This soap is aromatic and great for your skin. It makes bathing feel like an indulgence. It is also more long-lasting than softsoaps or most commercial bar soaps.</li>
    <li> Well to begin, I purchased this item on the favorable reviews.  That was a mistake, I truly don&#x27;t understand how this product gets all the glowing reviews, because my experience was awful,  I purchased this scent plus the coconut, plus two sample packs.  The smell was horrible, I put them all on the patio, hoping the air would help, but it did not.  This bar smelled like diesel not a smell I wanted to bathe with, even after the airing out, I tried to use this soap, but just could not take the awful smell, I ended up throwing all the soap away, a total waste of money.  Will NEVER again try this brand of soap.  If you chose to purchase this soap, I truly hope your experience is better than mine.  Trying to find a good soap is almost impossible.  I wasn&#x27;t able to return the soap because it sat outside for over a month, and amazon has a 30 day return policy.</li>
    <li> About 3 years ago I switched to organic soaps. I will NEVER go back to buying mass produced soaps in stores, they are terrible for your skin and health. Esp. ones with triclosan.</li>
    <li> Now this is real sandalwood. As soon as I smelled it I knew. I can&#x27;t wait to use this product. I just received it.</li>
    <li> I suppose this won&#x27;t qualify as a confirmed Amazon Purchase, my wife purchased this soap for me after reviewing my wish list on Amazon. This is hands down the best and most fragrant Sandalwood soap we have found so far. I don&#x27;t know what else to say about it, it simply works well, has held well, and the aroma is great. We visit those artsy fartsy shows and farmers markets all over ID,UT, and Western MT (oh boy lucky me) and if we MUST look at the stink good stuff then I am going to purchase Sandalwood soap, etc. In our bath right now is three different sandalwood bar soaps purchased this fall none of which are as fragrant as this soap.&lt;br /&gt;  Well now that I have found what I rate as one of the best Sandalwood soaps I don&#x27;t have to dally around the women holding home made soaps to their noses inhaling lilacs and the likes. The only thing holding me back from 5 stars is you couldn&#x27;t get two for one (that&#x27;s just me holding out for Farmers Market deal).</li>
    <li> It smells pretty good, but nothing close to the really nice fragrance normally associated with Sandalwood. I&#x27;m using it. But won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful soap. highly recommended. Before I used this soap I was an average guy. Now I can solve six crossword puzzles simultaneously while juggling three flaming torches and riding a unicycle. Amazing soap.</li>
    <li> Wonderful soap. Bought this in a 3-pack with Patchouli and Cedar-sage versions; have also loved the Bergamot-lime. Every one of these is a winner.  Soap cleans well but is gentle. It feels smooth, rinses easily, skin feels very good afterward. Great scent that is just the right strength. This is the good stuff! I keep these fine soaps on a self-draining soap dish, since I want it to last a long time. I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> Excellent soap, wish it was a little denser.</li>
    <li> Women seem to always want to sniff me when I&#x27;m out and about...great product!</li>
    <li> delivered quickly and smoothly.  This soap is all I&#x27;ve come to expect from Plantlife.  I have used this as a bath soap, but now I&#x27;m using it as a shaving soap.  Takes some creative carving to get it to fit in the cup, but the shavings ball up nicely and make a second mini-ball of soap for the side.  Fantastic stuff.</li>
    <li> This soap may be all natural, but it is gritty, leaves brown residue on skin and washcloths, and doesn&#x27;t even smell very good.  I threw mine in the trash after two days, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was turned onto this brand through my Petit Vour subscription. I love their soap. I am very pleased with my purchase. The sandalwood scent is great though it smells slightly licorice to me (not that I mind, I like anise). For someone looking for a pure sandalwood this might not do it for you but I love the scent. Earthy and spicy. Lathers well too. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. It smells so nice and relaxes the sences. I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This product arrived in a timely manner and was undamaged&lt;br /&gt;I bought this from reading the reviews about the wonderful scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This just smells like soap.  Since there is no packaging around the product maybe it just faded away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will never buy this SOAP again</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing!  It was delivered quickly and smells fantastic!  I can smell it on my skin hours afterward. Some of the reviews state that it doesn&#x27;t lather well and doesn&#x27;t last long but I have had no issues with lathering.  It is quite blocky and difficult to hold so to avoid this, I recommend cutting it in half and storing the unused portion in a zip lock baggy.  I also store the used one in a baggy when I&#x27;m not using it, this helps keep it from disappearing quickly as other reviews have also stated.  I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Been using this soap for years.... The smell was not the same ...will not purchase it again online&lt;br /&gt;Except direct from Plantlife ;((</li>
    <li> My husband loves these soaps, and I love the smell! I will continue to buy these for him. They are a little too drying for my skin type or I would use them as well, but for the rugged guys and gals in your life..this is the greatest soap since sliced bread!</li>
    <li> Smelled great, but didn&#x27;t last very long. Less than 3 weeks for the bar. I&#x27;d buy it again, I just wish I could find something to last longer and that smells as nice.</li>
    <li> My original order was for Mysore Pure Sandalwood Soap.  I fell in love with the fragrance of sandalwood as a child when I visited my grandmother, who kept sandalwood soap in the trunk where she stored her linens.  I would ask her to open it so I could smell that wonderful scent and I was thrilled to recapture it again when I was given a bar of Mysore Sandalwood soap as a gift.  I love this product for the purity and muskiness of its sandalwood scent and its luxurious lather, and was happy to find it on Amazon.  However, when I placed my order, I got an e-mail from Amazon informing me that Mysore Sandalwood soap cannot be sent into Canada.  I ordered the Plant Life sandalwood soap instead, and the product arrived promptly and in good condition as usual. But PlantLife&#x27;s product is a disappointment in that the scent is not pure sandalwood but derived from a mixture of sandalwood, boswelia and spikenard.  The smell is not offensive, but neither does it give off the scent of pure sandalwood that I was expecting.  Mysore&#x27;s scent is pure, unadulterated sandalwood and to me it is sheer heaven.    I order products from Amazon quite often, and always am very pleased with the service provided and the ease of the on-line ordering process.  I look forward to ordering again.      I would like to leave a suggestion with you.  Is is possible to arrange to have this product (Mysore Sandalwood Soap) shipped into Canada through the Canadian branch of Amazon (Amazon.ca)????</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite soap... smells great, it goes a little fast but i think that&#x27;s because of the natural cold-processing. Something about it just makes me feel good... worth trying, if you are curious. I used it at a vacation center, found in an organic food market; when i came home, i decided i needed to find the brand again. I looked online, there it was. Whenever I use it it takes me back to my vacation... perfect.</li>
    <li> This company is fantastic! Smells great and is awesome for sensitive skin. My kids even have some. Plus, every time i have ordered they have sent me coupons with free shipping! I will definitely continue to buy from them! Only soap you will buy after you order once. I have also purchased body oils and am completely in love!</li>
    <li> Good smell and skin feels really clean after shower. The scent is pleasant but will not give you a headache or trigger allergies.</li>
    <li> Thought this was sandalwood scent</li>
    <li> Each time I use this soap, I am transported to a different exotic place. It can literally put me in a different state of mind.&lt;br /&gt;I slice each of the soap bars into smaller pieces and use them as sachets in my armoire. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this soap. My entire house now has the scent of sandalwood  I put it in drawers with my writing paper</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy this product again</li>
    <li> This soap is very disappointing.I decided to give it a try after ordering a sampler from this company. I received the Soap... The first this I notice was that it barely had any scent. I assumed that a soap under \\&quot;aromatherapy\\&quot; would have a nice scent, but I thought...may be once I use it in the shower I will be more noticeable. Not the case, The scent is almost not existent and is not that good for cleaning either. This is a very poor quality soap with a nice name and packaging. If you are looking for a great soap with awesome scent try the \\&quot;Luxo Bahno\\&quot; sold here in Amazon.</li>
    <li> Sandalwood soap made my face and body smooth, it healed blemishes, the smell was wonderful!!!!</li>
    <li> This smells a little different than just plain sandalwood but very pleasant none the less.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> The smell is so relaxing, it fills up the bathroom when I use it. love it</li>
    <li> GOOD AT ALL  FATA  FATI</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells.  It does not lather up well however it the scent last a long time, and this is what I really like.</li>
    <li> A favorite fragrance &amp; also good for scenting lingerie drawers.</li>
    <li> Excellent soap with a great smell.  Tha ladies get close to me more often when I use this soap.</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on the description of what sandalwood would smell like.  Maybe I just don&#x27;t like sandalwood.  I like other soaps from plantlife.  I wont order this one again.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my guest restroom.  Once I smelled it, I realized that I wanted it for my bathroom.  I don&#x27;t usually buy scented soaps, but this one smells great and the smell stays on my skin.</li>
    <li> this soap is so old there is no smell at all.  i have bought this brand of plantlife for years  and never been disappointed. will never buy from this company again</li>
    <li> I love sandal wood.  The soap is the same aroma used in the old fashion barber shops in the 1950s.  I guess I am nostalgic.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re expecting a traditional sandalwood fragrance you might be disappointed.  This is a gentle, soothing soap with a slightly woodsy aroma.  At first I was disappointed, expecting more of a sandalwood fragrance, but I loved the scent as I showered and it left my skin less dry than most soaps which is important to me as I live in a dry climate.  It rubs off a little brown but, unless you don&#x27;t rinse, that&#x27;s not a problem.  :)</li>
    <li> My bofriend and I love this soap it smell wonderfull. He keeps asking me when are you gonna get more of that soap I love it I smell it on me all day! Worth Trying! :)</li>
    <li> Not too keen on this particular fragrance but the soap is what i expected.  Good size and price.  it lasts long too.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance and excellent soap.</li>
    <li> I love Sandalwood, but this specific brand didn&#x27;t quite capture the essence of it.  But, you should still give the company a fair shot.  It&#x27;s just like pepsi products.  One may hate mountain dew, while another hates pepsi.  There&#x27;s plenty of different flavours, and there&#x27;s plenty of different fragrances/varieties with this company&#x27;s products.  We&#x27;ve bought several, and most are fantastic, but every now and again you&#x27;ll have a bad apple.  There cheap enough to be disposable without use without tearing up.  Lathering has always been something that I&#x27;ve been impressed with regarding the soap.  Most &amp;#34;pure &amp; natural&amp;#34; soaps lack lathering power, but this company&#x27;s here for the long haul because they&#x27;ve targeted everything in their products &amp; made the most of it.  GREAT BUY!</li>
    <li> Provides a strong scent of sandalwood.  Maybe too strong.</li>
    <li> I really  like the scent of good sandalwood. This stuff has absolutely nothing to do with sandalwood. As far as I can tell, it also has nothing to do with Aromatherapy either. After receiving this, I immediately went back to Amazon, and ordered more of &amp;#34;Mysore Sandal Soap&amp;#34;.  Will never buy this (bleep) stuff again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m partial to the smell of Sandalwood, so if it smells great and last more than 12-days, I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Frankly, I didn&#x27;t buy this soap to bathe with.  I bought it because after having bought [[ASIN:B000K74USQ Bee &amp; Flower - Chinese Sandalwood Soap 2.65oz - 12/case]] to put in my clothes drawers, I realized that if this was sandalwood, I wanted more.  After looking at the strongest possible Sandalwood essential oils, I decided that these were REALLY expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma of this \\&quot;Plantlife Aromatherapy Herbal Soap\\&quot;  knocked me over with its invigorating and mysterious spirit.  Sharper than Bee and Flower, it took me a few breaths to appreciate it.  But once I did, I was smitten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had one quibble, once you pay the $3.00 shipping it does make for one expensive bar of soap.  But didn&#x27;t I say I wasn&#x27;t looking to scrub with it?</li>
