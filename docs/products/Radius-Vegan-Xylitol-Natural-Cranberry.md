      <li>It&#x27;s kind of cute, like a spider web or something.  </li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for the best natural floss, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I was impressed the first time I used this dental floss; it is so smooth and glides so easily.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light</li>
      <li>Your gums are very important for healthy teeth</li>
      <li>Glad to find one that worked.</li>
      <li>Saves money and time (and motivates me to floss more, knowing that another one is on its way!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it is supposedly better for the environment, so there we go.</li>
      <li>My most recent visit to the dentist was awesome (also started using Rupam&#x27;s dental soap).</li>
      <li>I hope this review helped you! :)</li>

      <li>you can floss with confidence :).</li>
      <li>Feels more like cotton than plastic.</li>
      <li>appreciate the vegan certification on this, leaving me sure that I am not getting mystery flavors and waxes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>&amp; I love that it is vegan and leaping bunny certified.  </li>
      <li>There needs to be more vegan flosses on the market.</li>
      <li>I love it,</li>
      <li>I hope this review helped you! :)</li>
      <li>I do like the mint better than the cranberry flavor which somehow tasted like dirt to me</li>
      <li>Saves money and time (and motivates me to floss more, knowing that another one is on its way!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Removes more plaque than store bought tape floss.</li>
      <li>I like the sort of texture this floss has, which grabs more tartar from around my teeth.  </li>
      <li>RADIUS brand does a much better job of removing plaque.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I like this better than the Glide;</li>
      <li>Tastes good and does not get stuck in my teeth like many other but cleans effectively with a pleasant minty flavor.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>That aside, it is a great floss, the mint flavor makes flossing more tolerable, and I appreciate that it&#x27;s a soft floss.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s kind of fuzzy and soft, and it does a good job of cleaning in between my teeth.  </li>
      <li>Wow your gums look great to...</li>
      <li>It frays quickly but is very strong still, maybe it would be more accurate to say it comes unwoven</li>
      <li>Easy to grip with fingers.</li>
      <li>I like  the floss because it fits between my teeth easily.</li>
      <li>This dental floss is quite strong and does not fray easily.</li>
      <li>but the strands still hold strong.</li>
      <li>Mint is not too strong and the packaging is sturdy and lasts until you run out of floss.  </li>
      <li>sure if this natural floss is as good at removing plaque.</li>
      <li>this is hands down the best floss money can buy!</li>
      <li>I like the floss just fine.  </li>
      <li>Took some getting used to, but in the end I loved that it was more effective than other brands of floss, healthier, and was a bonus that it was vegan friendly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also a huge fan of mint flavored teeth cleaning products.</li>
      <li>In addition to helping to keep your breath fresh, it keeps your gums healthy and helps prevent tooth decay.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this floss.  It does a better job than regular or waxed floss. It does shred just a little, but it isn&#x27;t enough of a problem to prevent me from giving it 5 stars</li>
    <li> This dental floss is quite strong and does not fray easily. It is neither too thick to fit easily between teeth, nor is it is thin that it hurts. I like this so much that I&#x27;ve added it to my monthly Subscribe and Save delivery.</li>
    <li> I love this floss!  I am a former dental assistant and current massage therapist and vegan.  This is an amazing floss!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Its very gentle on your teeth.  This is great.</li>
    <li> Shreds very easily. Wont buy agaun</li>
    <li> The wax comes off on your teeth even if you try to wipe the debris off the floss before using it. My teeth actually feel dirtier afterwards.</li>
    <li> Easy to hold and doesn&#x27;t shred or fray like normal floss. I have no idea why they call it &amp;#34;vegan&amp;#34; though.</li>
    <li> Excellent floss.  I like this better than the Glide; which is what I usually get.  Nicely scented, too.</li>
    <li> Very good taste and easy to use; it stocks a little when I slide it between some teeth that are too close.</li>
    <li> This floss is strange because it stretches out and then recoils on itself somehow again.  It&#x27;s kind of cute, like a spider web or something.  Anyway, it&#x27;s kind of fuzzy and soft, and it does a good job of cleaning in between my teeth.  I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is a great floss with no added chemicals and perhaps the only one on Amazon for those who are vegan (which I am not). The floss has a slight mint taste to it and easily slides between teeth, unless the same portion is used for multiple teeth in a row. Four stars for the premium $4 price for a pack of floss, but I guess that is to be expected if you want something that won&#x27;t harm you.</li>
    <li> I like  the floss because it fits between my teeth easily.</li>
    <li> Great floss, tastes good and works well</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Works really well &amp; I love that it is vegan and leaping bunny certified.  While I appreciate the paper packaging, the metal cutter on it tends to fall off; the only reason I am giving it a 4 star and not a 5 star.  This is not your regular floss either; it&#x27;s a bit thicker, but I like that, as it seems to clean between the teeth better.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I luv the hint of tea trea oil and the floss is able to slide but still do a great cleaning. Yes the floss will kind of expand or come loose after u pull it through... But who cares...it has already done the job.  I usually use Glide and I find that cuts my gums a bit. If u have TMJ, u will have to put a little more pressure cuz u r no longer using teflon... Lol.  Just a tip cuz it might make your jaw sore. I use it as a supplement to my toxic stuff cuz of my TMJ and hubby uses it daily. Will buy again. Luv it</li>
    <li> It does what it should. I like that it&#x27;s organic, which is why I buy it. Price is good too.</li>
    <li> I have tight spaced teeth and this natural product works well for me to gently remove plaque.  Removes more plaque than store bought tape floss.</li>
    <li> Floss is &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; and messy. Smells/tastes great.</li>
    <li> Best floss I have found yet! It&#x27;s soft on my gums and tastes great! All natural, too!</li>
    <li> kind of expands. Interesting. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> I would have gave this dental floss a 5 star were it not for the price, the price is excessive! That aside, it is a great floss, the mint flavor makes flossing more tolerable, and I appreciate that it&#x27;s a soft floss.  There needs to be more vegan flosses on the market.</li>
    <li> Great floss. Wish it were bigger because I use a lot of floss.</li>
    <li> It is alright.  I was hoping to buy silk floss.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a vegan floss look no further. I love this floss and have bought several. Roll lasts forever. I do like the mint better than the cranberry flavor which somehow tasted like dirt to me (but I still finished it). This glides easily and gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Nice minty floss. Shreds a little bit.</li>
    <li> This floss is alright, I have been using it for a few months, it does not have the same sharpness as the best ones out there but it is supposedly better for the environment, so there we go.</li>
    <li> I appreciate this dental floss. It leaves you mouth with a clean feeling and is gentle enough to strengthen your gums.</li>
    <li> Such a simple step to happier teeth &amp; gums- easily slides between tight teeth .</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get all the positive experiences with this floss. I read these and then paid a premium price for this floss thinking it would be a superior product. It is not. The floss shreds between the teeth and leaves the floss residue to be picked out, if you can. Back to the drawing board on this one.</li>
    <li> I was impressed the first time I used this dental floss; it is so smooth and glides so easily.  I will never go back to regular dental floss again.  The bonus is that it doesn&#x27;t have all of the nasty stuff in it that regular dental floss has.  It is a small package and will make it easy to travel with.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I often find my floss is ether too weak, breaks easily, and gets stuck or is too thick and doesn&#x27;t fit between my teeth.  Not only does this floss have a nice taste it fits fine and rarely breaks.</li>
    <li> This product is not great, but at least it&#x27;s natural. When I pull it out of the container, dust like material flies everywhere. It&#x27;s somewhat hard to get in between the teeth as well.</li>
    <li> Works great - I have tightly-spaced teeth and used to hate flossing. I love it, now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Choosing the right floss is a very \\&quot;personal\\&quot; choice, so YMMV from my experience. I can tell you that for me, this is an EXCELLENT floss! Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- the spongy string is both thin and wide and very malleable, depending on the surface you are against and how you pull it. This allows it to get in-between tight spaces, without \\&quot;cutting\\&quot; into the gum, while also being able to cover a larger surface with flossing action.&lt;br /&gt;- the flavor is nice, but not overwhelming&lt;br /&gt;- good fingertip grip, even when wet (I wash my hands bewteen sections)&lt;br /&gt;- works as it should, never breaks shreds (I can&#x27;t believe i even have to say that as an attribute)&lt;br /&gt;- Radius is a brand I trust and support&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly enough, when I first started to use this floss, I found that more \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; came out when I used this, over other flosses (even right AFTER using them!). Nothing else had changed. Now, after using it consistently, the gunk is reduced, so it&#x27;s my educated assumption that this is a more effective floss for me, than other flosses. I hope it is, anyway...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I go through floss quickly. I don&#x27;t like to reuse the same section (or touch a dirty section), so I floss and then move on to another section for another tooth. I never liked the idea of wrapping it around either finger and thought it was gross to reuse a section, even if it seemed clean. I hated flossing until I tried it \\&quot;my\\&quot; way - previously, I thought that you \\&quot;had\\&quot; to do it the other way. Also, I floss side to side, pulling the \\&quot;debris\\&quot; away from the gum, and not moving up and down (like they do at my old dentist&#x27;s office. Ew.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Floss is one of those things that&#x27;s so personal and so inexpensive (and varies so much), that it&#x27;s reasonable to just buy one of every kind from companies you wish to support, until you find the one that works best for you. I&#x27;ve tried several, gave a few half-containers away to others to try, and have settled on this one. Amazon, thanks for the S&amp;S! Saves money and time (and motivates me to floss more, knowing that another one is on its way!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - flossing is really important. In addition to helping to keep your breath fresh, it keeps your gums healthy and helps prevent tooth decay. From what I understand, bacteria in the mouth can get into your bloodstream and cause systemic inflammation and other problems. Plus, flossing helps your teeth look whiter, as the in-between spaces won&#x27;t be yellow and icky. Get a good mirror, find your favorite floss, and enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions.

    <li> I bought this because it has a simple set of ingredients, which you&#x27;d expect to be easier with floss. Some allergens are hidden in the &amp;#34;natural flavors&amp;#34; found in other floss so it&#x27;s nice knowing what&#x27;s really in this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floss itself has only a hint of mint, which is fine by me. It frays quickly but is very strong still, maybe it would be more accurate to say it comes unwoven but the strands still hold strong. It&#x27;s very light so it gets sharply into the gums to remove debris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Tastes good and does not get stuck in my teeth like many other but cleans effectively with a pleasant minty flavor.</li>
    <li> This is the first traditional (non tape style floss) I&#x27;ve been able to use with my tight spacing. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Great floss. I seem to pick out a lot more food between my teeth than I ever did with my old floss. It does start kind of coming apart after I use it on a few teeth, but it&#x27;s not a huge deal. I don&#x27;t sense a taste or a smell, so I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a good or bad things. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase and will continue using it.</li>
    <li> I first tried this when I was looking for a &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34; floss and now I&#x27;m sold.  This is my second purchase.</li>
    <li> The texture of this floss just wasn&#x27;t my favorite. It kept breaking or getting stuck in tight spots. I like the concept of Xylitol floss but this type just wasn&#x27;t effective.</li>
    <li> Never knew floss could be so superior  and different. This floss is soft and doesn&#x27;t cut your gums. Love the taste! It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> I never got around to reviewing this until now and the product has long been all used up for me. From what I recall, I loved it in some ways better than the ordinary floss you find in markets. It tends to stretch and get spots between your teeth more thoroughly, but then there&#x27;s the issue that it is a bit more fragile than other floss and that is due to the material which tends to fray. Also I personally do not like that at first it felt like I was using what felt like clothing material between my teeth. Took some getting used to, but in the end I loved that it was more effective than other brands of floss, healthier, and was a bonus that it was vegan friendly.</li>
    <li> finally toxic free floss, my whole family use it and everyone is happy!</li>
    <li> Its floss.  It cleans your teeth.  Its pretty strong, you could use it as string if you needed some string.</li>
    <li> Great Floss, not too thick or thin. The end unravels a bit after working with your teeth for a while, but it doesn&#x27;t affect the flossing. Well, it does get a bit of dust around the container, but it doesn&#x27;t change its flossing capabilities. I&#x27;ve had two dentist appointments since I&#x27;ve started using this floss and there hasn&#x27;t been any extra buildup!</li>
    <li> Learned that certain materials are unsafe for flossing.  With Radius Vegan Xylitol (natural sweetener actually healthy for your teeth) you can floss with confidence :).</li>
    <li> Love the mint floss, it is strong and holds well with great flavor.</li>
    <li> Really fresh floss that gets it where i need it!</li>
    <li> Definitely get my teeth cleaner and I like the after taste.. Too bad it&#x27;s kind of expensive</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s dental floss. Hopefully the Xylitol will help.</li>
    <li> Loved the oil. The only issue I had with this is that I kept it in the bathroom and the moist heat from showers made expand when I pull it out.</li>
    <li> this is hands down the best floss money can buy! Last visit to the dentist proved it. Cleaning was more of a &amp;#34;oh wow there&#x27;s nothing there. Wow your gums look great to...&amp;#34; This Is the floss to end all others!</li>
    <li> This was a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The minty flavor of this is subtle enough that I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m threading candy between my teeth, and there is no sour aftertaste.  There is a light powder coating from inside the cover of the floss, scrapings from the floss itself, but this is not especially bothersome.  The natural fibers of this floss were strange to me at first, as the floss was spongy looking until pulled taut.  It is effective nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the vegan certification on this, leaving me sure that I am not getting mystery flavors and waxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I will not hesitate to purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Really nice floss. Not painful to use like many other flosses.</li>
    <li> I like the sort of texture this floss has, which grabs more tartar from around my teeth.  Also, I like that the floss is narrow, so it can get into tight spaces.  Whenever I&#x27;ve used other flosses for tight spaces, such as Glide brand, I felt like they were so flat and slippery that they slid right over the plaque and left it on my teeth.  RADIUS brand does a much better job of removing plaque.</li>
    <li> I love this floss and have no problems with the product shredding as a few have said.  I am wondering if they are trying to pull it back and forth instead of up and down??  I have somewhat tight teeth and have no problems getting it in between my teeth.  I love that it has such a different texture than other floss, quite soft and cottony.  It&#x27;s not harsh on the gums at all. Perfect!</li>
    <li> My new favorite dental floss</li>
    <li> Not sure if there&#x27;s supposed to be these white particles inside the case. It looks like white dust. I have a feeling I got a really old product.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it&#x27;d be the same as the RADIUS Organic Silk Floss with the only difference of having the mint flavoring. I was wrong, this product is very different, I found the texture lacking and it shredding more than the Organic Silk Floss. The texture is too smooth, I don&#x27;t feel it grabs much tartar from around teeth like the other type. The Organic Silk Floss has a better texture and feel, and doesn&#x27;t shred much.</li>
    <li> It shreds a little in my teeth.</li>
    <li> Love it. Case seems a little excessive plastic wise, has a very large lid. mint flavor is not crazy strong. Floss could be softer but is not a hard gum cutting string. Easy to grip with fingers. Do not notice the xylitol but it really can only help your mouth.</li>
    <li> Really leaves your mouth feeling clean.  Great product Great price.</li>
    <li> Wanted something that would work as well as not be dosed in chemicals. This floss is doing the job just great. I will definitely buy it again and I love the &#x27;natural&#x27; feel to the thread, doesn&#x27;t feel like a sting of plastic between my teeth. Feels more like cotton than plastic.</li>
    <li> Great quality floss... love the mint flavor!  nice a bad price either!</li>
    <li> I love to floss. I love the way it feels &amp; floss 2x/day. I&#x27;m also a huge fan of mint flavored teeth cleaning products. This kind of missed the mark for me on &amp;#34;minty-ness&amp;#34;. I didn&#x27;t taste any mint whatsoever. Maybe I got a less minty box.. who knows. I still gave it 5 stars because it had a slight shred but was still totally useable, is vegan, and made in USA. I&#x27;m happy and I&#x27;ll keep using it. I finally found a replacement for my beloved not-so-great for yourself or the environment commercial floss, and the price is definitely comparable.</li>
    <li> Very nice, I love this floss  .....</li>
    <li> I like the floss just fine.  If I could change it I would make it into a tape type floss (personal preference) because when I am flossing it is more like a small string rather than with a flat edge/side like other flosses I have used. If you have ever used floss threaders it is the spongy type string that is really fluffy at first and then after you use it, it gets more condensed like string.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the wax gets on my fingers and must be washed off with soap. I wash my hands after flossing anyway but the wax is particularly sticky.</li>
    <li> I have a lower permanent retainer on the bottom of my teeth, so I have to thread the floss underneath it in order to floss between those teeth.  It frays when threading through and pulling it back out, occasionally getting wrapped around and stuck on the retainer.</li>
    <li> I used to not care about floss. It was all acceptable largely because it was all unremarkably reliable. But over the past few years, as nearly all consumer products have been cheapened to the point of uselessness, my floss has followed suit. It has become easy to break and shred, too thin, too slippery or even greasy, and at times has odd kerosene like odors. I thought perhaps I was getting old, going crazy, or both. Then one day I tried this floss. It does not shred in my mouth or get stuck between my teeth. It does not suddenly snap in two while flossing my molars. It doesn&#x27;t smell like diesel. It isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy. Your hands can even be a bit wet when using this product and it will still stay wrapped around your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above are the reasons I like this product. Others may like it because it&#x27;s vegan, mostly natural (the string is nylon but the rest of the ingredients are natural), or because it has Xylitol. Please shop around for reasonable prices. Some people are charging far more than others for the same product.</li>
    <li> Price is obviously too high. But if you&#x27;re looking for the best natural floss, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thread is gentle and narrow enough to use between tightly-spaced teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered Tom&#x27;s to compare. Tom&#x27;s was wide and painful to use. Nearly ripped out a filing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if this natural floss is as good at removing plaque. Waiting to see.</li>
    <li> I use this floss with my xylitol toothpaste and my teeth have never been whiter and healthier, thank you for such an amazing product :)</li>
    <li> Very strong floss.  Mint is not too strong and the packaging is sturdy and lasts until you run out of floss.  Your gums are very important for healthy teeth and I don&#x27;t want to put something in my mouth and rub it in my gums that has chemicals and man made materials.  Keeping things organic is important and this floss has been used in our house for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with my gums (healthy teeth but bad gums and plaque build up every dentist visit). My most recent visit to the dentist was awesome (also started using Rupam&#x27;s dental soap). No scraping and no red, inflamed gums or bleeding at the dentist office which is usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this floss feels really clean and doesn&#x27;t have that waxy, stringy feeling. I won&#x27;t use anything else now!  This is some great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: If you have wide spaces in between your teeth you can fold the floss over and double it up for better cleaning.</li>
    <li> This floss, unlike Radius&#x27; other floss, gets between my very tightly-spaced teeth well. It has an unusual texture, but it works. I wanted ecofriendly floss that could become very thin, and this is it. Radius&#x27; other floss was too thick. Glad to find one that worked. This can get a little shredded if you don&#x27;t use it carefully, but as long as I&#x27;m mindful, it works. No other natural floss on the market worked for me, I tried everything else.</li>
    <li> Great floss, even if it does get caught it&#x27;s relatively easy to work with.</li>
    <li> I never thought I would love a dental floss,  but this never shreds and does a nice flossing job.</li>
    <li> It cleans teeth really well.  I love this floss.</li>
