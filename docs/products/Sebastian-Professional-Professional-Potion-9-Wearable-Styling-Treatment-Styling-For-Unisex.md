<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First time trying this stuff and I like it very much.  Gives my hair shine and body with control and no crunchy hair!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product over 15 years ago and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since!  I love how easy it makes it  for me to style my own hair!</li>
    <li> Sebastian Potion 9!!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for a year, still using very satisfactorily.</li>
    <li> Best styling product ever!  This gives my straight hair curls for the day!</li>
    <li> the product is like the photo and the user is satisfied with the purchase is&lt;br /&gt;positive vote. thanks for your very efficient service</li>
    <li> When you first use a bit of Potion 9 (too much is too much..I use a one pump) while styling wet hair you can just let it sit after combing into the shape you want until your hair is dry. Your hair will look wet and even be a bit crunchy to touch until you comb it and then...VOILA!, gorgeous, super silky straight or curly hair (depending on how you let it dry). Sebastian Potion 9 is miraculous stuff for my, on the fine and wavy side, dark strawberry blonde hair. Because my hair is light in color the product will really give me a wet look until I first comb through it. I also use Potion 9 to create a straighter look. I didn&#x27;t have any Potion 9 for a few miserable weeks and had forgotten how frizzy, fine and fly away my hair can be without it!! I think maybe it&#x27;s the silk protein, an ingredient in Potion 9, that makes it a totally indispensable product for me (even with over packaging..I want the tube back!) For years all I have needed is a good shampoo and Potion 9. Anyway, I&#x27;m here to buy some right now :-). I was writing a comment in response to someone&#x27;s review and decided to just make this my review because I love this product and want to explain how unique it is to use.</li>
    <li> I have kinky, curly hair. I use this as a leave in and it prvents frizz. I have used it for 15 years. All the other product do not work as well on my hair. This is a godsend.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price! Fast delivery! Will purchase from again! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Have been using it for years.. Gives volume which I need</li>
    <li> Good product especially when mixed with a styling get.</li>
    <li> Sebastian No. 9 is a product that is wonderful for my curly, \\&quot;hispanic-type\\&quot; hair.  It was sold in stores in tubes, but since I couldn&#x27;t find it, I ordered on Amazon (which is where one can find almost anything).  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t see that it was available in a tube but in a pump-type container, which I don&#x27;t like because it&#x27;s hard to get the entire product out of it.</li>
    <li> Not bad it is well made and does a decent job.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I use it everyday. My hair is very difficult to keep a natural curl in but when  I use this on damp hair and let it air dry it adds more curl to my hair. I also use it when drying and straitening. It makes your hair very soft and shiny and it does not make it feel oily. It smells great too!&lt;br /&gt;It is a decent sized bottle for this type of product so it lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> Keeps the frizz away, moisturizes while it styles, and is soft and manageable</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It does wonderful things with my long bob.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! I have naturally straight, thin hair.  After showering I applied a pump to the ends and mid section of my hair, sparingly at the top combined with a bit of mousse and I had beautiful waves throughout the day, without the feeling of tons of product in my hair.  Love!</li>
    <li> Really helps keep my hair healthy and easy to scrounge style my short hair.</li>
    <li> great product,your hair will love it.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this product because I was always having to brush my hair throughout the day to keep it looking good. The product helps things stay in place but doesn&#x27;t solve my problem. It still need fixing because my hair needs a more moisturizing product.</li>
    <li> my hair has near been in better condition since using this product</li>
    <li> Leaves hair so manageable</li>
    <li> I tried a sample from a friend and liked the end result enough to buy more on amazon.  I  recommend this hair care product to anyone seeking hair care solutions.</li>
    <li> This does add a nice shine to your hair, but when I used it I did not like the feel of my hair.</li>
    <li> I received my order and I am very pleased with it. Really nice product, leaves hair soft and easy to manage</li>
    <li> Great leave-in hair conditioner, the best out there that I have found.  It&#x27;s very difficult to find now in stores like Walgreen&#x27;s, so I&#x27;m grateful you sell it on-line.  It&#x27;s sold at the same approximate price as I used to pay when buying it off the shelf.  Shipping and handling do not \\&quot;pump up\\&quot; the price.  I was a little leery about getting it shipped through the mail, thought the texture of the conditioner might be affected by heat of shipping.  But its quality was fine.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> both two have no top cover, and one has no bottom. it&#x27;s not new.</li>
    <li> I used all throughout the 90&#x27;s and loved it.  I switched to Bumble, forgot all about it, then was reminded about Potion 9 while trying to find other products on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am SO HAPPY they still make this!  It is fantastic!  My hair is SO SOFT but has style hold too.  The ends are in great shape.  I don&#x27;t have to re-apply during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using Bumble De-frizz and applying about 3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday and this holds between washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not a big fan of the tube, and not a big fan of this container either, but what&#x27;s inside?  Oh yea!  Big fan!</li>
    <li> use it every day, if i don&#x27;t I&#x27;m not me.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get this product  I received an old packing that the lady at the beauty parlor said she hadn&#x27;t seen for 3-4 years it messed up my hair big time. No stars</li>
    <li> An acquaintance told me about this product because of my dry, flyaway hair.  She purchases it at her salon but since I do not go to her salon I thought I would see if it was available via Amazon.  I ordered it and have continued to use it and have found that it consistently keeps my hair so soft and manageable.  I hope the price stays the same as I know the quality is great!</li>
    <li> Been using Sebastian Potion No 9 for years and absolutely love it. Look forward to doing business with you again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Perfect for damaged hair..</li>
    <li> The girl who cuts my hair turned me on to this stuff. It works better than any other hair product I have tried. I don&#x27;t know what they put in this product but it makes my overly dry, dull hair, smooth and shiny. It actually changes the texture of my hair. It is virtually impossible to find in stores though so thankfully its available online.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and have always used typical brands like (Tresemee, etc) and nothing helped tame it. My mothers friend used it who had naturally curly hair and so when I ordered it off of amazon it tamed it so much that I love it and would order more when I run out !</li>
    <li> Made my hair feel silky and strong. I&#x27;m African American with course relaxed hair that gets dry and breaks easily. My hair felt protected when I used the blow dryer and I haven&#x27;t seen any breakage!</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my hair at all.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few products that works to tame my frizzy crazy hair. Use it every time i wash my hair.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and I love it! I have naturally curly hair that is often unmanageable, but with this, I have pretty curls that are not frizzy! I use it in wet hair and let it air dry. Then just comb out. Soft , pretty curls.</li>
    <li> this product was recommended to me by my hairdresser. I have very curly hair and it gets frizzy very easily. I have not had any problems with frizzy hair since I&#x27;ve used this product. It makes your curls more bouncy. I really really recommend this and like this product its my new favorite.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about five years and absolutely love it.  I recommend Potion 9 for those who want a good styling product.</li>
    <li> just perfect for my hair</li>
    <li> This stuff is auh-mazing. It smells great and really helps keep my hair frizz-free. I always recommend it to all my friends!</li>
    <li> Made my hair softer. Hasn&#x27;t done anything for helping to style or dry naturally. Maybe made it a little less unruly. Be careful not to use much at all or near your roots. It will give you a greasy look.</li>
    <li> I have extremely naturally curly hair, as in long spiral curls. I apply to my hair when still damp .It starts out as crunchy curls in a.m., then seems to relax by midday, then my curls loose shape in the afternoon and &amp;#34;unwind &amp;#34; as if I used a curling iron to curl it and it went flat. I have dry hair that tends to frizz with some products but this one seems that it may be too heavy or greasy for me.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Without it my hair lucks frizzy and dry.  It gives my hair a much more smoother effect.</li>
    <li> This product is great for my baby fine hair, it gives it body, helps it take curls better and gives it a bit of texture as well.</li>
    <li> I received this without the lid on the bottle.  It also looked as though it may have been used.  A small amount was on the tip dried.  I would not have thought to much about it except the lid was not even in the box.  The product itself is good and I did not bother to send it back.  I would just buy it in the store or a different company within Amazon.</li>
    <li> They changed the packaging as well as i think what is inside. I used to like this when I tried it in the old toothpaste type containers. It seems to dry much more like hair gel or dep instead of the more conditioner like hold from before. Not sure if this is in my head or the \\&quot;potions\\&quot; ingredients changed????</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair and I tried many different hair products to try to get rid of the frizz and define the waves. My aunt recommended this product, so I gave it a try and I love it. I only use a little, the size of a dime on my wet hair, then diffuse it. Works amazing. My hair is always soft, never sticky or crunchy. Give it a try!!</li>
    <li> thank you for providing such a great product. This product should have NEVER BEER DISCONTINUED....</li>
    <li> I like this product but it is often hard to find in stores. The smaller version is great for travel.</li>
    <li> After reading everyone&#x27;s comments I was eager to give this a try on my untamable hair. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything I&#x27;ve come across [yes, I have tried WEN, Frizz Ease, all the top high end expensive brands] and nothing has worked to for my frizziness/poofiness what ever you want to call it. This is not exception, it didn&#x27;t live up to what every one else made it to be. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This is a  good product</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! I have super frizzy hair and have tried everything else. I found this product about eight years ago.  I put it on my damp hair after the shower and it keeps the frizz away. :) :) :) for once in my life I have &#x27;normal people hair&#x27; !!!!!</li>
    <li> Potion 9 is great for a medium hold with no residue. It also dries w/o flaking and best if applied to dry or almost dry hair. Amazon has the best price by far!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff to get your wife !</li>
    <li> I have been searching my entire life for a hair product for my poofy, frizzy hair, and yet i never found anything that would tame my hair until I discovered this! Sebastian Potion 9 is the most amazing product, it helps hold my light curls in and gets rid of my frizz. Just apply the product after the shower, you can experiment how much you want to use, and it will make your hair so soft and smooth! If you are looking for something to help tame your hair, I most definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 20 years.  It is truly the most valued product in my bathroom cabinets.  It is light, moisturizing and really helps every style I choose.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bootleg version of the product. It smells like it should and the consistency is right. I have troublesome hair and this was my first time using it. It&#x27;s more of a treatment/leave-in for me. I need something to fight the frizzies and unless I put in tons of it, this product doesn&#x27;t cut it for me. But if you don&#x27;t have issues with fizziness then it might be good for you.</li>
    <li> really nice is makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I started using potion 9 as a styling agent for my curly hair. The curls hold all day and remain happy and glossy.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, have been using it for years. Keeps curls in tact and even with a curling iron it keeps!!</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have found this product on Amazon. I can no longer purchase it where I live. I have used this for several years and when, at first, I could no longer find it in town, I tried other products and none of them seemed to be as good as the Potion 9. It arrived well packaged and on time and I would recommend it to a friend or family member.</li>
    <li> I started off with a small tube just to test this product.  It&#x27;s great and I&#x27;ve now graduated to this larger pump size, along with the &#x27;Light&amp;#34; spray for in-between days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more can I say?  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I wish I could find this product everywhere!  I love how it helps to tame my naturally wild hair.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product of all time! My hair looks so shinny and its a one-stop-shop for getting those beach waves :)</li>
    <li> Superior moisturizing, hair repairing treatment.</li>
    <li> Not in love with this product. I use it sparingly, but still end up with my air clumped together in hard waves. Not my favorite, but I will finish using what I&#x27;ve got.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as any other products on my my fine hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a busy hair</li>
    <li> Does what it is says it will do. Conform, soften, model one&#x27;s hair to a style worth wearing. I can only suggest you try it and see if it satisfies the control you seek.</li>
    <li> What a difference for wearing hair curly. I don&#x27;t like a lot of product in my hair. If I put this in wet, I do nothing else to and it is curly and lasts all day. I have been searching for something like this for a long time!</li>
    <li> it arrive without the bottle cap, and even feels really light like much has spilled or dont know, i feel robbed</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair and keep going back to this styling creme.  Its lightweight and keeps curls in shape.  All I do for my hair is wash it every other day, comb it and use small amount of this product, then allow it to air-dry.  Friends and coworkers always say how soft and full my curls look - this is amazing product for women with curly hair.</li>
    <li> This product contains protein which helps provides strength to your hair a needs source to maintain healthy hair and promote growth.</li>
    <li> It was a product that i have already tested before and I bought some more because i like it alot.</li>
    <li> Good product that is effective before blow-drying</li>
    <li> I use it before curling my hair and it keeps my hair curled until my next hair wash. I have super straight hair so keeping  my hair in curls is a challenge.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best hair products I have used. Works great when straightening hair but also gives great texture when I want soft natural curls. Love it!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this product on my fine natural curly hair, and I noticed it was really light and held my curl and kept the frizzy&#x27;s away. Terrific stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel dirty or stiff. Very light, and my hair feels just as clean as the day I washed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend!</li>
    <li> its price is reasonable!&lt;br /&gt;it is similar to the moroccanoil curl defining cream.&lt;br /&gt;I used both, both are good &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Sebastian Potion 9 for years! My hair is baby fine, but this does not weigh it down - it adds volume! Even as my hair as changed throughout the years - it&#x27;s now super curly, this wearable conditioner has continued to be the best! Makes my hair soft &amp; shiny!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair that I often straighten (with the help of 400 degrees of ceramic HEAT). This stuff is the HEAT. Keeps my hair smooth and shiny but not greasy. I also really like it for when I wear my hair curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give is a shot, people!! It&#x27;s pretty freaking good.</li>
    <li> I use this product when my hair looks tired, it can be used after shampooing and after my hair has been sprayed with water</li>
    <li> I have wavy/curly hair and i have been playing with different products for my hair for a while now! This smells delicious and I don&#x27;t have to do anything after 30 seconds of scrunching it in to my hair! So worth the price because you don&#x27;t use very much of it! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Personally i don&#x27;t really see the hype?  I didnt notice any changes with my hair.</li>
    <li> I have thin, but naturally curly hair and I&#x27;ve LOVED Sebastian Potion 9 since a hairstylist turned me on to it over ten years ago.  My hair is so soft and my curls are so perfect with Potion 9!  I&#x27;ve tried going without before and I was amazed how different my hair was.  (And not in a good way.)  I&#x27;ll never stray again!  I&#x27;m a Potion 9 fan for life!</li>
    <li> I read good reviews on this product and I was not impressed myself after I ordered it and tried it. I wont be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I had vacillated from using gel to mousse on my hair (of which gel worked the best) until I bought this product. I put a dime-sized amount into my curls and it&#x27;s full, moisturized, and soft for days. If you follow NaturallyCurly, I&#x27;m a type 3A and this product works the best on my hair.</li>
    <li> Keep the frizz awsy..and you use  a tiny bit...otherwise  you&#x27;re  going to make your hair look greasy.  I use it every  single  day.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  I just blow dry my hair until it&#x27;s damp, then put in the Potion 9, scrunch my hair with my hands, and let it air dry.  It produces really pretty waves that last (my hair is slightly wavy).  My only complaint is that the pump is AWFUL, and I practically have to break my wrists to get the product out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have to run around town trying to find this at a salon or retailer, so easy to just click here and have it mailed at the low fee.  I use it in my hair after showering and it holds my hair in place after styling while it dries.  When my hairs dried I just run my fingers through my hair to get the wet look out and my hair stays styled and conditioned!</li>
    <li> Just makes your hair stiff like it has glue in it.  Not impressed.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and a perfect delivery</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Can&#x27;t buy it in stores.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair treatment for 25 years and I would not trade it for anything else, it makes my hair so soft without weighing it down and for me that is very important since I have fine hair, it also makes it shiny and bouncy. It has a pleasant smell without being annoying. I would recommend it without a doubt.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery. Good price. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for himself, and he got the info from a friend, he seems to like it very much.</li>
    <li> I love how my hair feels after using this! Not quite as curly as I had been hoping for but maybe I am not using enough or my hair is too long or something. But my hair is soft and smooth and just so touchable! It&#x27;s a good product even though it is a little pricey.</li>
    <li> This has always been a great product. Used it for years. The new packaging is nice and I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I used to use this a few years ago when it still came in a tube.  I&#x27;d been meaning to get some more, even though I&#x27;d heard the product was changed, and finally did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my thoughts are that the product is still good, though I really have to be careful not to put too much in my thinnish wavy hair, or it will just weigh it down too much, but that&#x27;s true of most products. I do like how soft it makes my hair feel, and how it takes care of any possible frizz.  So I like the product (though admittedly I remembered it as being more of a miracle product than it is, but....)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I HATE the packaging.  It&#x27;s in a pump, except it doesn&#x27;t really have a little spigoty thing on the pump, like lotions do.  Instead, the top is just smooth, with a little hole for the product to come out, and there is really no way to get it to come out well without getting it all over.  It is really oddly hard to use, and I just thought, really?  Someone couldn&#x27;t try this and see how stupid this design is?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s bad enough I don&#x27;t really want to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So good product, still, but lousy design that is almost a deal breaker for me.  It was much better in the tube, or at least in a normal pump bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It keeps my hair soft and holds the curl most of the time.  The only complaint I have is the bottle.  The pump mechanism is not very user friendly.  I like the container for the larger amounts but I don&#x27;t need that much.  The last time I bought the 16 oz it lasted for over 2 years.  You do not need to use much to get a good effect.</li>
    <li> Liked it / Haven&#x27;t been using it for very long.</li>
    <li> Will order this again! Smells fab and leaves hair soft!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sebastian Potion 9 on my curly hair for over 15 years! I have tried to use other &amp;#34;trial size&amp;#34; products while traveling, and more than once we&#x27;ve interrupted our vacation to go in search of Potion 9 to tame my wild locks. It&#x27;s getting harder to find, though, so I&#x27;m thrilled to discover the automatic refill option on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I used this product after losing my hair in 2000 after recovering from Typhoid.  The product really added health and thickness to my hair and since then I&#x27;ve used it on and off.  Now I am growing my hair long and this product keeps the health of my hair more than any other I know.  Well worth the price and lasts for a long time</li>
    <li> The product is great, however be warned that the packaging may not hold up in shipping. The bottom of the bottle had busted and the product had leaked out. It&#x27;s probably worth paying the extra $2 to buy it locally from now on.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it works great!!!!  I will be buying it again!</li>
    <li> The product itself is wonderful but I gave it only 3 stars because the packaging is a disaster. I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get the pump to work.</li>
    <li> great product! i&#x27;ve been using it for 5 years and won&#x27;t change it! It also hidrates you hair and gives shine. Perfect!</li>
    <li> This does absolutely nothing to my hair. I have naturally frizzy/wavy hair and this didn&#x27;t help it with the frizziness.</li>
