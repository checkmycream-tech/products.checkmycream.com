<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This feels so good on my face. I do wish they had put right up front that it was not for freckled skin but I guess I will just have to use for myself alone. It does tingle and feels a little shocky when you first adjust the amount of energy going through it</li>
    <li> Have not opened it directions extremely vague considering returning it</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t really see results</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t Remember the date I bought but I think I have been using for 4 weeks once a day only missed a few days.  The right is before the left is after. Fine lines are fading and my eye lids are not as puffy or droopy. I use it on eyebrow and lift up going towards hair line just started that a few days ago did it by accident and have continued. Again just Recently I was just lightly running it along eye bottom and top started using more pressure and going under baggy part of eye on bone from nose to corner of eye all the way to hair line. Hope that makes scene&lt;br /&gt;I am editing review this is two weeks after I added picture so 6 weeks used once a day I used coconut oil before treating in am and original oil of olay after treatment and in pm. The green eyes are all before I left my contacts in and hazel eyes are after I took contacts out so I was sure to be able to tell difference. I thing it&#x27;s a huge change I am keeping my d&#x27;arsonval&lt;br /&gt;1 year later I got carded by the woman at the register while buying paint she said I looked under 30 and I&#x27;m 53. I use it once a week Keep up the good work D&#x27;arsonval</li>
    <li> This product is of poor quality . After having used for 5 minutes the power of the hight frequency decreased to only 25%. One of the electrodes was broken on the third day because it was difficult to plug in/out. I don&#x27;t recommend this product. Try to buy another professional high frequency product.</li>
    <li> Returned I wasn&#x27;t happy but that doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s anything wrong with the company it just wasn&#x27;t it wasn&#x27;t a good fit it wasn&#x27;t what I expected it to be</li>
    <li> Just as I thought it would be! Works perfectly!</li>
    <li> Great price and use it all the time.  Great results.</li>
    <li> Very Good machine, it really works!</li>
    <li> I would buy this again.  I hoped for more directions on how to use it for the best results. Priced right.</li>
    <li> First off, I just barely ordered this item on Thursday, 11/13/14, &amp; I already got it today, Saturday, 11/15/14. It arrived carefully &amp; neatly packaged with one plug-in hand device, with 4 glass instruments, &amp; instructions. The instructions were clearly written by, either a person who does not know the english language at all, or this person is 50 shades of crazy, &#x27;cause they don&#x27;t make ANY FREAKIN SENSE. Thank God I have another device very similar to this one &amp; I&#x27;ll be using those instructions instead of the ones that came with the item. Anyway, the glass instruments are super delicate &amp; need to be very gently handled. They look like they&#x27;re hand blown glass. Good item, fast shipping, fair price. I bought it from RG City.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.. 11 r gone and my puffy eyes.. My husbandoves it as well.. I am pleased with my purchase</li>
    <li> This is my first week using the machine, I am already see improvements in the texture of my skin, I will write another review next month.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Not sure.first use one of the tubes stopped working right away. Sometimes if the base of the tube touches you you feel like your getting electrocuted even on low speed. As far as results too early to tell.Cheaper than the famous other one I have that only has one small tip.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read some of the reviews about how it is not a violet, but orange.  And yes, there is an ozone odor with use.  However, personal experience my varicose veins have greatly been improved with its use.  The adjustable setting makes it useable on face or legs.</li>
    <li> I have only used this several times and I am amazed at how refreshed my face looks.  the lines and wrinkles are not disappearing yet but I am sure with time they will be less noticeable.  I have had several people remark at how nice my skin looks including my doctor.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks glowing after each use.  In addition the puffiness on my eye lids has shown a definite reduction in puffiness.  I will continue to use this it is not painful and so easy to use.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It does help healing acne and any wounds on my body.</li>
    <li> At this time Im going to give this product 5 stars for delivery &amp;contents..any review of the  product itself would be premature ,since Ive only had it for 2 days&lt;br /&gt;The product came in a padded box with individual slots for storage.there are 4 electrobes included so there isnt any need to purchase the ones a reviewer below suggested.i have used it on one side of my face and i like the results .i dont have severly bad skin, apparent aging or wrinkles.however i do have a small crease in my forehead and indents by my cheeks that i would like to smooth out.i am a person of color age 40.ill update this and rerate should i find this product not living up to my expectations .good day</li>
    <li> This machine boasts so many favorable skin benefits. I beleive I was making some headway until my wand broke a couple days after I got it. Insert sad face. Cant give more than I honestly know. Its true you get what u pay for.</li>
    <li> I would never use this product for antiaging purposes. But I do have acne prone sensitive skin so I use it to sterilize my skin and it works like a charm! Best money I ever spent</li>
    <li> I have tried everything for facial scars and I mean everything but this has soften them and made my complexion the best it has looked in a long time. I use it two to three times a week for 15 minutes at a time. I have only had it for 2 weeks and already see a difference! I say try it!</li>
    <li> The customer service experience has been the best I had ever had...Curious and helpful, Not to mention generous! Similar products are way more expensive and do the same</li>
    <li> This arrived in about 1 week. Good. Directions strange and unintelligible. Not so good. Has a strange smell when using and leaves a strange smell on your face. It&#x27;s not a bad smell; sort of ozoney. it doesn&#x27;t bother me though it might bother someone else. I have used this device twice and I already see and feel results. Very good...that&#x27;s what i bought it for. Price is great. Very good! I have some rosiness to my face after usiing it twice...kind of like i was in the sun for an hour and got that nice sun kissed look. My skin feels incredibly smooth and looks smooth and glowing after just two sessions; my sessions lasted about 10 minutes total each time. I used all the attachments except the comb but i imagine that will work great too. My hair is very thin and does not grow very fast at all so it will make me happy to have thicker and faster growing hair using the comb attachment! As far as wrinkles...I don&#x27;t have alot of wrinkles anyway so I can&#x27;t comment on that. I do have some slight sagging near the chin line so we&#x27;ll see if this helps although i haven&#x27;t noticed any improvment at this time. I also have some sun damage and creasing on my chest. the skin on my chest seems less spotty and much smoother in appearance so there has been some slight improvement there also. Overall, a very good purchase for me. One caveat to this review: I do a weekly tumeric/milk/honey treatment on my face which works incredibly well for improving tone and texture of the skin and had just done a treatment the same day I first used this machine so my results may not be typical. Oh, and I am 48 years old. I have been considering some kind of spa treatment or non-invasive skin tightening lift for my chin area but now I will hold off. This little thing is perfect for me right now and I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> i haven&#x27;t seen any results yet, I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month, I think the frequency it&#x27;s not high enough to make any difference in the skin.</li>
    <li> I received it a month ago, It works perfectly for zapping acne. Basically what it does is that it kills bacteria inside. That&#x27;s mainly what I bought it for. I gave 4 stars because I received a cracked hair comb. And it does not remove wrinkles, age spots, of fine line. My esthetician  said that this is just a made up story for selling purposes. And for using it a month every single day, I do not see any removal of the freckles(believe me I have a lot of them on my face).  However, it does zaps acne.</li>
    <li> I cannot give my opinion abot this product because I did not receive it. Instead I received something similar called the spot remover which I am in the process for return it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it as much as what I would like but I do believe it works.  I actually like the way it feels when you touch or skin with it. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at.  It makes your skin feel like its stimulated and it is.  I am going to keep using it and I have tried it on several other place on my body and its seems to be improving as well. I would say it could use some better directions.</li>
    <li> Have only been using this a week or so but so far am pleasantly surprised with its ease of use, considering there were almost no instructions included (not seller&#x27;s fault). Skin is feeling smoother and better. Looking forward to discovering more of this item&#x27;s wonders.</li>
    <li> This device is awesome for acne. If i get a zit, I zap it at night when i go to bed; the next morning, it no longer hurts and looks way better; after that, it heals much faster than normal. I use it 2 times a week all over my face and it makes my skin really soft. The instructions are hilariously bad. There are plenty of you-Tube videos and articles on line to get some real instruction.</li>
    <li> The unit arrived in a timely fashion.  I have only had it for a few weeks and not noticed a whole lot of difference in my skin.  I do like the smell it leaves behind though, kind of fresh and clean.  An electronic smell.  I broke the mushroom electrode attachment by accidently sitting on it  and had to order a new one.  I am trying to remove an age spot on my hand and getting it to shrink by using the sparkler attachment.</li>
    <li> This item works as described and is solid in construction.  instruction is there but limited.  I went online to get further instruction and video which I would have done anyway</li>
    <li> I have only recently used it but it appears to be reducing my deep wrinkles.  The instruction book is a little unique because it was written by someone that doesn&#x27;t completely understand our language.  I went online for reviews of many different brands and got a lot of good information there.</li>
    <li> the plug is not american no where does it say that!</li>
    <li> This device works like gangbusters on acne for me.  I can&#x27;t speak to its effectiveness for wrinkles or dark spots, as I only received it a couple of weeks ago and haven&#x27;t been using it for that.  Product is very inexpensive, feels great to use on the skin, has the goofiest instructions believable---basically just plug the attachments into the base, check that the dial is turned off, plug it in, turn up the dial, and use.  It&#x27;s very simple.  It clears up whiteheads in a night, in my experience.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> works really good and the price was right. you can turn it up on high or low</li>
    <li> 10 mins; 3 times a day with some gauze over the electrode.  Really controls my hormonal acne like no other product.</li>
    <li> Use regularly.  My skin has a slight glow when I use regularly.  Not sure if I am using correctly.  Excited to see long term results.</li>
    <li> I am 45 years old with no dark circles, an even complexion, fairly young looking skin (most people think I am 35 and sometimes younger) as I do take good care of my skin on a daily basis, but I have begun Menopause and wanted to start doing some \\&quot;extra\\&quot; work on my skin considering that estrogen levels drop and collagen production and elastin in the skin is less once Menopause begins and I have noticed a bit of \\&quot;drooping\\&quot; in my cheeks and definitely a slight bit of crepiness that I am not at all used to or fond of :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product for 2 weeks twice a day using a high quality night and wrinkle specific moisturizer (Neutrogena brand) when running the tool over my face, I can honestly say I did not think it was working at all and I have beeen having the worst headaches and neck pain after 2 weeks of using it. What I found, by doing research on YouTube (as the instructions are not in any sort of legible English) is that you have to actually somewhat \\&quot;burn\\&quot; the skin, which is then supposed to encourage new cell generation and collagen boosting. However, to do this, you basically have to somewhat injure the skin in the area which you decide to use the tool. I have been using the small bubble glass attachment and found that it causes my skin to dry out and peel. Also, in general, it is what I would describe as a relatively painful \\&quot;zapping\\&quot; electrocuting process when using overall, so be prepared for some pain, my fellow girlfriends. My skin was pretty red and slightly painful for the entire evening in the areas where I was using the bubble tool. I don&#x27;t have any pain when using the mushroom tool, but it really seems to be doing nothing as it is pretty cold and it is supposed to \\&quot;heat\\&quot; the skin to supposedly \\&quot;work\\&quot;. So, this was what I was doing, seeing no results and I was set to return it and even printed the label and everything for UPS to pick it up tomorrow...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight, being the \\&quot;never give up\\&quot; kind of person that I am, I re-read a lot of the reviews, read up more on High Frequency Facials and tried a new method...in the bathroom, not near any electronic devices...LOL (keep reading and you&#x27;ll see why I say this). What I did tonight and DID see results is when I used the curved oval tool and put a good amount of my moisturizer on my face and eyes...like a thicker layer and just ran the tool over the areas, but not touching my skin. OUCH, yes! But, I would then run the tool over the area on my skin and that seemed to calm it down. Then after running my hands all over my face in the end and working my product in, my face looks so tight and refreshed...CRAZY...it is like a mini face lift! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I will give this thing a bit more time and see what it does with this new method over the course of the next few weeks and see what happens. If it holds up and doesn&#x27;t fade out an extreme amount every day before I use it, as I still plan on using it every day, I think I will keep it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, what is frightening me off and is a MAJOR PART of why I was about to completely return it today and why I will only use in the bathroom, is when I had my Blue Ray DVD player and computer monitor playing on the bed the night before last when I decided to turn on the High Frequency tool and use it. When I turned it on, it temporarily \\&quot;fritzed\\&quot; the DVD player out and the computer monitor screen went all crazy and lost image, had a total scrambled electrified look to it, and was putting off a loud buzzing/ringing sound. Luckily after my husband kept turning the power strip off and on and doing the same with the Blue Ray DVD player, everything went back to normal....WHEW! My husband had said that on other days when I would turn it on while we were using the DVD player (streaming Hulu...LOL), he would see the computer monitor screen and our lamps in our bedroom flicker. So, to know that this thing is putting off some sort of frequency that can possibly blow out electronics and cause lamps to flicker is quite bizarre to me and would lead me to believe that long term use may be dangerous, especially considering the headaches and neck pain that I have begun to encounter after about 2 weeks use. Now, I&#x27;m not sure if they are related to the tool or perhaps they are migraines from being in menopause (we&#x27;ll have to wait and see, I guess)? Am I crazy to keep going....maybe...but, what we ladies will do for beauty?!!! Oh, also, one thing to note is that if you have fillings in your teeth (which almost all of us have) be prepared for your entire mouth to taste like metal and have \\&quot;other\\&quot; things come out smelling like metal as well...yucky! : (&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had in the past used a RF (radio frequency) red LED machine that was working wonderfully until it broke and will probably get another when I can afford it. Unfortunately it was $700.00, so that will be quite a way off. That machine did tighten the skin on my whole body pretty incredibly with regular use using a conductor gel and with no pain at all. I still have a red LED panel and will probably try having it on my face afterward to heal the redness on my skin faster with using this High Frequency tool, as that is what red LEDs do! I will continue to try this method, if I find that it works, until I can afford another high quality RF red LED machine. Unfortunately, the ones that I have found that are priced at 100.00 or under do not get great reviews on Amazon, so I will not waste my time or money on those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review has helped anyone that is considering purchasing it. I am giving it a honest review and I really don&#x27;t know at this point if it is safe or truly effective, but am going to keep going and keep this updated.

    <li> I like using this - we&#x27;ll see what it actually does - plan to continue.  You have to look up information about it as the instructions are silly.  Go read about the violet ray machine - this one is orange but that is just because they use a different gas inside.  Same principle.</li>
    <li> Well I love it but it&#x27;s starting to fall apart with one month of use.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use.......I have no idea if it works.  I can&#x27;t use it as often as I should.</li>
    <li> It does every thing you read about or see on Youtube. I love it. I used it on my niece&#x27;s neck once and skin tags fell off. It makes a huge difference in how your skin looks and feels. I am not going to worry about makeup when my skin looks so pretty. It does take years off your face and neck.</li>
    <li> I find that the machine really works well and I am using it regularly. It helped my sister&#x27;s pain so well she bought one also!. Better than chemical medicine.</li>
    <li> First of all, let me start by saying no product, gadget or procedure is going to work for everyone. For example, I knew someone who got laser resurfacing for wrinkles. There was absolutely NO improvement whatsoever. Nothing. Zip. Zilch. A lot of people have awesome results with that same procedure. Why that is, I haven&#x27;t a clue. This little gadget is obviously no different.&lt;br /&gt; That said, I&#x27;m one of the people for whom this thing is practically working miracles.&lt;br /&gt;  Just a little background...&lt;br /&gt;  I used a friend&#x27;s Dermawand and I loved it! I noticed a subtle firming of my neck the first time I used it. I used it a total of 3 times before I decided I had to have one. I was all set to buy one until I found this thing for less than half the price. I couldn&#x27;t resist. So glad I took the plunge!  In terms of power,this is better than the Dermawand and I love that it comes with all the attachments! The Dermawand doesn&#x27;t have those.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve used this unit only four times thus far, but I&#x27;ve used the Dermawand four times too, so that&#x27;s eight treatments. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve noticed so far. I&#x27;ve noticed a quite remarkable firmness in my neck. That started happening with my first Dermawand treatment and it is still looking quite nice! My entire face is notably firmer. I can see it and feel it. The slight hollows under my eyes are improving! That I did not expect. I don&#x27;t know if that will continue to improve, but I&#x27;ll take what I got and be grateful for it. Some stubborn forehead lines seem to be slowly fading. I can&#x27;t say with certainty more than that about the forehead lines, but I do think they are looking better so I&#x27;m going to keep zapping those suckers and see what happens. They aren&#x27;t that bad and don&#x27;t bother me too much, but hey, if they can look better, why not treat them? My face is GLOWING. It really just looks so healthy and dewy and fresh.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m not saying that these results are  minblowingly DRAMATIC. It doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve had a facelift or anything like that. I&#x27;ve just noticed improvements in these areas that have me VERY pleased. I&#x27;m in my mid 40&#x27;s and I have realistic expectations. I don&#x27;t expect the fountain of youth from this thing or ANYTHING. My twenties are long gone and good riddance. I&#x27;m not trying to look a certain age; I just want to like what I see when I look in the mirror. I don&#x27;t expect this thing to give me surgical results or completely obliterate any and every sign of aging. Nothing can do that. And if something could, that would be kinda creepy.&lt;br /&gt;  Nothing has given me this much improvement in such a short time, not professional grade home peels, retinols, vitamin C serum, at home LED lights. Along with sunscreen, ALL of those things have been beneficial to some degree or another and I&#x27;ll probably continue using most of them, but this thing blows them all out of the water.&lt;br /&gt; Now I&#x27;ll mention some negatives. The instructions are a joke. Read them only for laughs. I wouldn&#x27;t say they&#x27;re 100% indecipherably useless, but they&#x27;re pretty bad. Another thing is, the unit needs to be treated with care. Insertion and extraction of the pieces should be done gently with a gentle twisting motion until the piece is firmly in place. Don&#x27;t just shove the pieces in there. This is not an expensive unit, so assume the quality is not at the level that you can be anything but very gentle with it. Also I do kind of wish the power level had numbers on it like the Dermawand but that&#x27;s not a big deal, just start low and increase.&lt;br /&gt; Now I can&#x27;t say how long this thing will last. I&#x27;d be lying if I said that wasn&#x27;t a slight concern, but at this price and for what it&#x27;s done for me? If it fizzles out, I&#x27;ll buy another one. I&#x27;ll be disappointed but I&#x27;d give it another go or possibly even two before I upgrade. I LOVE this thing and I have no regrets.ng like that.

    <li> Didn&#x27;t expect it to come from Hong Kong, but I like it.  Still learning how to use it.</li>
    <li> I could not even get this product to work. It was a total waste of money, and the only product that I have ever bought on Amazon that I had total dissatisfaction with to the degree of giving it such a poor rating. I Could not even get the product together and felt an electrical shock when trying to do so.</li>
    <li> I have looked for something to help and I mean really help tighten my skin.  This is amazing!  I used it everyday for two weeks then took two weeks off.  The area on the sides of my chin and my jaw line have tightened  and I feel so much better about myself. I was very self conscious about this area.  It has tightened a lot.  I also use it on the back of my hands and on my arms and have seen some change in that area as well.  It does hurt when you use it around the mouth area,like small prickles.......but it is worth it in the end. I clean it with alcohol before using it, to make sure it is sterile.  I would recommend this to anyone that is getting sagging skin and wants to tighten it up. I started using it again on Sunday for my second two weeks...........Today is my birthday and I look great for my age........................For the price you just can&#x27;t lose!!!!  Yeah!!!!</li>
    <li> Saw diiferences right away. I was amazed. Fine lines and puffiness reduced after two or three uses. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> My wife bought this, and absolutely loves it.  She would recommend it to anyone who wants to tighten their skin.</li>
    <li> Ive had this for 5 months now &amp; it is just as advertised. I&#x27;ve had no issues with it at all &amp; still cannot use it on its highest setting. I don&#x27;t know what the higher priced versions can do that this one cannot but it&#x27;s absolutely all that I need &amp; more.</li>
    <li> I just opened the box and found that I got a high frequency wand that has a EUROPEAN plug.  I cannot even use it here in the US.  Very frustrating!!</li>
    <li> The silver part of the mushroom shaped glass tube/wand got stuck in the device -- I was able to carefully pry it out and now can only use the other wands.</li>
    <li> I like the product and would recommend to family and friends.  Only used it twice and it seems to do the job.</li>
    <li> I have worked in the cosmetic industry for many years and have used great skin care products.  As I approached my 50&#x27;s my skin started to loose elasticity and collagen.  I have been desperate to find a solution that wouldn&#x27;t break the bank.  I am happy to say I have been using this device for 1 month and have already seen a dramatic difference.  The skin on my neck and jawline are tighter and the marionette line near my mouth are not as defined.  I use it daily and I can see a difference if I skip a day so it is a daily regimen for me.  I have to be gently with the glass rods inserting and removing from the wand as one of them did come apart from the metal base when removing it.  Luckily my fiancé retrieved it and super glued it back together and it is good as new. I follow the path of the lymphatic system, which is up and out towards the ears and hairline.  I use a good serum and coconut oil when I use the device.  I strongly recommend this product, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I very much like this device so I bought the acne one for myself and then I bought a &amp;#34;skin tightening&amp;#34; one for my mother. I actually paid 1$ more for the skin tightening one. They are actually the exact same thing. same model, some extensions, same box. same everything. they were even sent together. great product and it was sent in a timely manner, but I thought I was purchasing two different things.</li>
    <li> Seems to be a great value for the money. Many well made pieces.</li>
    <li> in my attempt to hold back the aging process just a bit longer. Have had it for all of three days and it has helped to make my skin more toned, the pores more refined. Best investment I&#x27;ve made in myself in awhile.</li>
    <li> I began working at a spa over a year ago and was finally introduced to the importance of facials and taking care of your skin properly.  This bad boy right here is perfect for at home facial care between visits to your esthetition.  Key part of facials, even if you do everything else, this is what kills the bacteria for good and zaps the zits.  More than worth it!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any change in skin and it has a pretty bad smell but it works great as a BDSM toy. ;)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do as advertised or as others who reviewed it said. Buyer beware as this was a total waste of money!</li>
    <li> Amazed at the price, great quality unit. We used a high frequency alot in school. Didn&#x27;t realize they had a home product.</li>
    <li> This did absolutely nothing...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 52, Wish someone would of told me about this 10 years ago.  I noticed changes in my wrinkles the first day I used it, now after one week people are saying my &amp;#34; skin looks really good, what are you doing?&amp;#34;  I also use good skin care products and believe that the D&#x27;arsonval helps penetrate products better. I followed the advise of many of the reviews and did my home work on proper usage for this devise, there are a lot of helpful videos on youtube and google .  I urge anyone who has no experience to do the same, the instructions that come with it are terrible.  They don&#x27;t tell you to hold your finger to the tool before touching your face and it will send a small shock if you do not.  They do not mention that you should not use products that contain alcohol when using, or what each fitting is designed to do.  You will love the results and is the best $30.00 bucks YOU WILL ever spend, highly recommend !</li>
    <li> I buy these items after trying at a salon so I can continue salon type procedures at home at my convenience and continue to refresh renew my skin. At first it tingles but get used to overtime, helps with tightening, brown spots.</li>
    <li> This high frequency machine works great especially for the price.  If you have never used a machine like this watch the videos on you tube.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0077CNO1G D&#x27;arsonval High frequency direct for Home Use - skin tightening, Wrinkles, Fine lines, Puffy Eyes]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised how well this D&#x27;Arsonval unit works considering the price. It&#x27;s well below the cost of the other units, but performs exactly the same with the same voltage and Frequency. Also the attachments are exactly the same as every other unit out there. It has done wonders for my skin when using a good face cream and my husband has seen enhanced results when using the comb attachment with minoxidil. He had no hair growth with minoxidil until using the D&#x27;Arsonval.&lt;br /&gt;Very Pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell if this did anything or not.</li>
    <li> This is a great device, I can tell that the wrinkles on my face are slowly diminishing. It beats getting a face lift or any type of surgery. Its a reasonable price for skin tightening.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 51 years old and been using this product since April 2013.  Definitely noticed skin is brighter and the dark circles under my eyes are decreased.  Has helped with my teen&#x27;s acne as well.  Great customer service from seller to boot!! Highly recommend :-)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see it reduce my wrinkles, but it definitely shrinks my pores and reduces acne.  It kind of stimulates my face and wakens me up.  It is also reducing the puffiness on my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I used it as directed I&#x27;m sure it would work better.  Overall, I would recommend it!!</li>
    <li> This seller is great with the packaging and fast delivery.  I&#x27;ve used this a couple times a week and what I see is the shrinking of pores and some firming of the face, but no improvement with wrinkles the main reason for the purchase.  The info. on the box received did say it was for spots but the photo looks no different from the package I received.  As mentioned in other reviews the directions are laughable and would like more info.  included on how to use this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with fine lines, spots and puffiness, but haven&#x27;t really used it for that so far.  I have been experiencing adult acne from stress, hormones and not eating right for years and this has done such a great job treating it, that I haven&#x27;t really much used it for anything else yet.  I love the &amp;#34;zit zapper&amp;#34; attachment.  The way I use it is to set the dial to about 25% and place my finger on the glass tube just above where it goes into the machine.  Then I place the end of the tube on any acne spot and release my finger, holding it in place for about 10 seconds.  I then put my finger back on the tube and lift the tube away from my skin.  That keeps it from arcing (sparking) and I find that works much better for me.  When I do a treatment like that, the spot is gone within a day or so.  I only have time to use it once a day (usually in the morning before I get ready for work).  Make sure your skin is very clean and sterilize the glass tubes with an antibacterial wipe or rubbing alcohol.  Use a dry paper towel or clean cloth to handle the tubes.  See Nastypupp&#x27;s video for some great information on use and handling.  Anyway, I no longer stress about acne because I know I can keep any flare up from getting out of control without any of those drying topical medications or creams.  I am so happy for that alone.  I have also been using the comb but it hasn&#x27;t been long enough to know if it is going to help with my hair loss.  It feels great and I hope it does work.  I think this is a miraculous find at the price for treating acne and would highly recommend it to anyone for that purpose.</li>
    <li> Im not sure whether this product works or not. But the smallest one hurts me when i touch it on my face.</li>
    <li> I LAKE VERY MUCH I will recommend to a frend .thank for  you service.good by. look for to christma for new item.</li>
    <li> Comb came broke missing a tooth so it don&#x27;t work, rest  of it is great, trying  to just get a replacement  comb without having to pay to return</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give this 10 stars if I could!</li>
    <li> Love it! Feel like it&#x27;s working on the grays and hopefully on the fine lines, as well! need more time to tell more...</li>
    <li> I only used this machine twice but unfortunately it gave me a terrible migraine both times. The first time, I had used it all over my face for about a minute before bed on a low-medium setting and woke up a few hours later with a throbbing migraine. I read a review by another user that said when she used it by her temples she got a migraine, so I avoided that area the second time and still got a horrible migraine. If you are prone to migraines, stay away. They should really add that to the list of cautions and warnings.</li>
    <li> Knew that this was nothing more than a spark generator. All it is -is a neon light without the coating to generate light..I bought it having  made them before to burn off warts .This is so weak it won&#x27;t have any effect, if it did it would be banned by the FDA. None of the claims are real. Have someone slide over the carpet with their socks on to generate static electricity and touch your problem area that will be 1000 times more effective then this harmless but worthless snake oil device.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly contained every thing advertised seems to be working time will tell</li>
    <li> I used this piece of equipment about six times in two months and had no problems. Last time I used it the stem came apart and&lt;br /&gt;is now stuck inside wand. I followed all instructions. It was attached with a small dollup of glue and came apart. The section inside the&lt;br /&gt;wand is impossible to retrieve because the wand is one solid piece. There are no phone, e-mail or addresses on the box or in the&lt;br /&gt;instruction manual. There is no one to contact and apparently the Amazon guarentee gave me a month. I can&#x27;t even contact the seller.&lt;br /&gt;What a piece of junk. Shame on you Amazon for dealing in foriegn undependable goods.</li>
    <li> My esthetician has used this on me for years when I&#x27;d have a subcutaneous blemish or breakout. Now I have my own!! and I don&#x27;t have to run across town to get rid of zits!</li>
    <li> I recommend this to any one it deffinitly makes a change.</li>
    <li> This thing is a life saver for zits. I love how many different wands it came with. A+</li>
    <li> Have to figure out how to return it, as it comes with no invoice or instructions that make any kind of sense. Was really excited about his product before I got it and realized I can&#x27;t use it!</li>
    <li> Received promptly, for the price it is a good product I do not really notice any difference, where in professional treatments you do see something right away, but I may not be giving it enough time.</li>
    <li> This is a \\&quot;spot remover\\&quot;...Only!!!..not as advertised!!..packaging specifically states only that..nothing more..so don&#x27;t be mistook by any other wording in the description.</li>
    <li> I sold it on ebay and got just enough money out of it that it covered my cost.  I used it for 3 weeks religiously and saw no change.  It could be me, or the machine; I don&#x27;t know.  I used it on high and it stings a tiny bit on your skin (less than an static electric sting).  The miniature lighting inside the thing looks cool, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I got my D&#x27;arsonval High frequency unit two days ago.  I used it the first time yesterday morning and again last night.  I am a 61 year old woman and I look fairly good for my age but one area that has bothered me for years has been the waddle under my chin.  Those ugly aging long bands that protrude out of your neck and make you look really old.  I had looked into a face lift and even considered the face lift we see advertised over and over again on TV.  But the cost and the idea of having surgery outweighed my vanity.  Well let me tell you, fellow waddlers, I already see an amazing improvement in my neck area.  It is tighter and smoother already!  I used it with Watts Beauty 100% Pure Hyaluronic Acid sold here on Amazon, as well as Timeless Argan Oil Pure 100% also sold on Amazon.  I do not know about the Watts or Timeless being something to assist in getting rid of my wrinkles, but they do work to help glide the glass wands over my face.  I used the mushroom wand only, so far.  I intend to use it 2 times a day, for at least the next two weeks to see how the long term affects will be, but I can tell you that in just one day I see an improvement.  My neck even feels tighter.  10 years younger here I come :)</li>
    <li> An attachment broke the first day I was trying to change out to another one.  Also, let me warn you - if you have metal fillings don&#x27;t get this.  I tried twice and both times I could taste bad metal taste as well as my heart started racing.  Strange but won&#x27;t try again. On the plus side it looks and feels like a good quality item for the price you pay for it, I just can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Got it pretty quickly packaged very well have used product couple of days and seems to be doing  What is  expected  so I&#x27;m sure the more I use it I will be very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> A piece arrived broken</li>
    <li> No directions on how to use not sure it makes a difference. Have never seen any</li>
    <li> Electrode broke off into machine after FIRST USE. I was very gentle. Bad glue, cheaply made.</li>
    <li> My primary areas of concern :  Neck area  Mouth area   Lip lines  Eye Area   Sunken look   laugh lines   Crepe skin  Expression folds   Cheek area  Forehead lines  Hair line   Parking lots  Occasional blemishes  Egads!  Anywho.  Works almost immediately on neck.  Stubborn lip line.  But better.  Eyes. A subtle improvement.  Cheeks.  Forehead.  Hair.  All subtle improvements.  My one nasty blemish was zapped!  Great machine to use when you&#x27;re put on hold!  I love that you don&#x27;t HAVE to grease yourself up!  ~  Update:  Use on neck.  True results.  ( Neon )  Use on hair.  True results.  ( Argon )  You can buy electrodes from Amazon.com.  Neon or Argon.  All Spa.  11mm  ~  Also,  zaps zits !  ☆( argon )</li>
    <li> I have been using this product 3x a week for 6 minutes each time for the past two months as advised by the instructional videos online. I was instructed to begin w/5 minutes of use and slowly work my way up to 10 minutes.. The rumor is I should see some results within a couple of months. I have no change in skin texture, tightening brightening in anything actually. I will continue to use this product and who knows? Might work, I read an awful lot of reviews prior to purchasing and most everyone seems satisfied so I will plod on and continue to use it. Keep the faith. In other areas shipping was right on time and the product was well packaged however the only problem I had prior to using it is that there were no clear instructions on how to use this item (as a lay person) and when I contacted the customer service number located in the pamphlet I was told to go online and check for instructional videos on its use. I think the staff should be able to provide me with better help than tell me to go check out someone else&#x27;s video on the use of this product.</li>
    <li> It works as described, fading my spots and my hair looks so bouncy and full, not to mention it took care of some awful leg pain, try this thing, you probably won&#x27;t regret it, also it doesn&#x27;t hurt so don&#x27;t be afraid.</li>
    <li> I love it!  I read through several reviews before I decided to make the purchase.  It is not pricy compare to what is available out there.  I used it religiously for a week on a nightly basis for just a few minutes.  And before I know it, I thought there&#x27;s more life to my face than before.  I would not say it helped tightening my skin or diminishes any wrinkles, but it is obvious that my face is not as dull as before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, but my jawline looks more toned and my eyebrows are more lifted.  It is also great for zapping pimples-they then dry up in a day or two.  The most shocking effect was on my upper arms-I was getting &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; arms, but they looked almost miraculously more shapely in a few days. My legs are probably too much for this device, but I am quite surprised and extremely pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet, due to the instructions reading like poorly translated instruction booklet, or a book of riddles, I&#x27;m looking on line to try and find some sort of guidelines online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has great reviews, so I have high hopes, but don&#x27;t want to use it until I know how to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIX THE DIRECTIONS!!!</li>
    <li> For the price, it&#x27;s very good. My face feels and look better since I&#x27;m using it! I recommend this item.</li>
    <li> This product emits an amber color. I use it daily on my clients for circulation. Great price for this product.</li>
    <li> I had planned to purchase the Dermawand, but there were too many poor reviews for me to be confident about that purchase.&lt;br /&gt;It may be too early to evaluate the D&#x27;arsonval High Frequency, but I haven&#x27;t seen appreciable improvement at this point.  The minimal information on the outside of the box isn&#x27;t even written in good English and the name of each of the four pieces enclosed as well as their appropriate application are not explained comprehensively in detail that would support usage by the general public.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what it&#x27;s doing for my face-- but I had a scaly patch on my leg that it has healed. It had been there a LONG time-- more than a year-- and nothing I did made it go away. Using the smallest tip at the highest setting has killed or deactivated whatever it was. The patch is mostly gone and  clearly not whatever it used to be. it&#x27;s smooth and looks like a healing tiny scar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will keep using it on my face!</li>
    <li> (53 years old - Female) Been using this product since last November (2013) and I have to say that I am very pleased with it, overall. It came to me well boxed, with protective foam padding that holds all of the glass attachments. Go ahead and trash the instructions...they are useless and laughable. Lots of info online about how to use this and get the best benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use mine with Pond&#x27;s Rejuveness cream, but you can use many other products, as other reviewers have pointed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles with this, but I can honestly say that my skin looks (and feels) fresher and healthier, and my pores are shrinking, which is a very nice thing to happen. I get a little rosy glow just after I use it, so the real difference is seen the next day; for me, anyway. The lines in my forehead have diminished greatly, and are continuing to do so. My crow&#x27;s feet and dark circles (hereditary!) are on their way out too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually work on one area of my face at a time, giving each area about 3 or 4 minutes, and going back to zap the deeper lines when I&#x27;m finished. It&#x27;s actually very relaxing, and can be done watching TV, without much thought or effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t hurt when you use it. Just start off with the lowest setting and work your way up. Especially if you use the &amp;#34;sparkle&amp;#34; technique for deeper lines. That can be a little &amp;#34;ouchie&amp;#34; if you zap yourself with a high setting, so definitely start low with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re going to get out of it what you put into it, make no mistake. Use it every day, and you&#x27;ll see results. Use it once in awhile when you think of it, and you won&#x27;t see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a really nice at home skin treatment that makes me feel pampered. No regrets with this purchase at all.</li>
    <li> Like others have mentioned , its good for acne breakouts and drying oily skin. Skin tightening and wrinkles I can t speak on. I have used the hair wand but can&#x27;t tell if its making a difference yet. Here&#x27;s the weird thing. If I place or wave any attachment over my left temple, it hurts my brain. NO joke! It&#x27;s really freaky and makes me wonder what that&#x27;s all about, since I have not seen any one else mention anything similar. I did notice headaches after using on head, but am wondering if maybe its unrelated. will have to try it out more to be sure. I mention it because I wonder if anyone has had headaches. I will update this review in a few months.</li>
    <li> I purchased this thing after reading all the hype about &amp;#34;high frequency&amp;#34; and was excited to give it a try.. Ive used it about a week now and have seen NO results.. Maybe Im using it wrong? Its supposed to be used like the dermawand,... same premis?  correct?..&lt;br /&gt;All Ive gotten so far is a headache from the horrible smell this thing gives off and crazy looks from my son who walked in on me and my &amp;#34;frankenstein machine&amp;#34; as  he calls it. point blank I didnt expect miracles but I did expect something..&lt;br /&gt;I will do more research on this thing before giving up, but before buying this thing make sure you do plenty of research</li>
    <li> meh.... used it religiously for a month (brushing my hair every night for 10 minutes, weekly facials. meh... you go further with buying hyaluronic acid for $12, and ditching the machine.</li>
    <li> I knew that the wands were glass when I purchased this item. What I didn&#x27;t know what how hard it was to put and take them off the handle.  I went of youtube and they mentioned to use a face cloth...well that just slips off.  I just didn&#x27;t feel safe using this product.  I felt like it was going to break in my hands.</li>
    <li> this product is BAD BAD BAD, no improvement after daily treatment during 6 months. WAIST OF TIME AND MONEY</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work had to return it!</li>
    <li> For the price, I would recommend this because it does improve the size of pores but is no miracle.</li>
    <li> I am so very satisfied with my purchase! dermawand had nothingober this one! i referred two friends one purchused it already! the other is placing her order thank you!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the equipment itself, problem is I have to hide it from clients when idle. It looks WAYYYYY too much like a vibrator though! Could be less obvious I think but like it otherwise lol.</li>
    <li> This is a nifty little gift . It works great and is better than what I could have imagined . For the price it&#x27;s a steal. Yes , the instructions ate a little harder to follow but it doesn&#x27;t tequire a ricket scientist to figure thos out. Watched the online video and viola . It&#x27;s easy amd fun to do.</li>
    <li> this does not work for lines or wrinkles but it does zap away pimples if you have one at night and zap it it will be dry in the morning and almost gone I have  not seen much as far as lines but it does make your face feel clean.. as far as the pleasant spa smell I read about I think it kind of stinks.. its a metal like smell.. I use it with 100% Pure argan oil or aloe still stinks</li>
    <li> I used this twice on the lowest setting, it was okay.  The third time I used it, on just above the lowest setting, it burned my face.  It looked like a severe sunburn.  It was red, swollen, painful and peeled.  It took almost a week for my skin to recover.  The directions are also very poorly written, you really have no clue how to use it.  I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> First of all the so called instruction booklet was useless,told you little to nothing on how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you look up on you tube the instructions on the Derma Wand.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the D&#x27;arsonval for about three weeks and so far have not noticed the slightest difference to my face.My skin looks and feels exactly the same,that is why I didn&#x27;t want to spend all that extra money on buying the Derma Wand,at least I have not wasted much money in buying the D&#x27;arsonval high frequency wand.I guess us ladies will try anything to feel and look better as we age,it was worth a try but I never seem to learn my lesson.It was extremely disappointing..</li>
    <li> BETTER THAN A FACIAL. USE IT WHEN WATCHING TV. TEXTURE OF SKIN HAS GREATLY IMPROVED. VERY AFFORDABLE FOR JUST ABOUT EVERYBODY.</li>
    <li> Very surprised with this product...have used it three times and already see my complexion clearing! I&#x27;m really amazed. Puffiness under eyes already looks reduced. Pores look reduced. Skin feels tighter. Skin has a healthy glow. I&#x27;m 29, have an oily complexion, and hormonal acne. The thing kind of works, people! **Also, I have a permanent retainer on my bottom teeth and do not experience any unpleasant side effects while using high frequency.</li>
    <li> I first tried the mushroom shaped tube. It screwed in with no problem. Next I wanted to try another and it wouldn&#x27;t screw in. None would anymore! I would have to hold my finger on the tube to keep it from turning which isn&#x27;t safe. It&#x27;s too bad. This wasn&#x27;t the type that just pushed in.</li>
    <li> I just received my portable high frequency and the probes do not fit what so ever. I have used other portables and this one was just sent with the wrong probes. Very disappointed because I&#x27;m going to school to become an Esthetician and could have benefited from this.</li>
    <li> Not as strong as I thought it would be, but still works.</li>
    <li> Well the first night I used  this product I  I did not see a difference in my face until the next morning . Then I saw my pores got smaller,my face got an even color and the fine lines on the bridge of my nose almost disappeared. The second time was one day after until i read comments some people used everyday so I did and my bunny lines seem disappear but slowly. So far and happy with this product. Forgot mention I am 37 years old female first week using this device.</li>
    <li> In love with this device! It has been 2 days since I started using it, but the cystic acne that I get along my chin has already shrunk down dramatically! I was reluctant at first because I have no formal training, but I did my research &amp; asked an aesthetician about proper usage. I&#x27;m excited to start using the comb attachment! Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I do this daily and really feel like my skin looks good. I zap pimples and they reduce in size immediately. They aren&#x27;t gone right away, but this helps a lot! I think it helps with lines too but hard to say. I&#x27;m doing this and a glycolic peel too, plus vitamins, collagen supplements etc. This is one of many things keeping me looking good.</li>
    <li> The seller is RUDE. Product is fine, was a bit dirty, but I love how it works.</li>
    <li> Great product. I got this as a second unit for when I travel</li>
    <li> For $32.00 you can&#x27;t go wrong!  Works just like the ones in the spa that the estheticians use. Little leary of inserting and removing the glass pieces, waiting for one to shatter while inserting or removing from hand held device, but so far, so good.  Very happy with item,  would buy again.</li>
    <li> Hi. I have not noticed any amazing changes in my skin. I think it is too soon for me to say for sure. I was asked to write a review so I am. I like the ease of use. The product seems to be high quality and well made. I want to see improvement in the eleven lines and horizontal lines across my forehead. I have not noticed any difference in lines and wrinkles at all. I usually give any product I try at least a three month trial. I just hope that if this gadget does not work I sure hope it does not hurt or make anything worse. I&#x27;m not sure if I should use around the eye area so I won&#x27;t until I find out more about doing&lt;br /&gt;so. I will update. Buyer Beware. Hi. It is now October 28th. I like that I have not had any blemishes since using this product. I like the way it feels when I use it. My skin looks like it has a glow everyday and I still enjoy the way it feels. I have not noticed the 11 lines nor the forehead lines gone. I will be happy if they just do not get any worse. I will continue to use this product and will update once a month.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine who use this item recommend this to me. It&#x27;s usage is so basic that Ican use it easily,I feel that it works on me. My skin became lightined after applicated this item.</li>
    <li> The delivery was fast. I enjoyed using the devise but in 3 weeks of using it the metal part that covers one of the ends of a glass tube came off and got stuck inside the devise so now I am unable to use it. Had to contact the seller in order to return it. Not sure if I order another one because it might break as well. Will look for a different supplier.</li>
    <li> This is really nice and makes your skin feel so good afterwards. You get a little pink and u know it is working for your skin . Love how my skin feels after each use. I would recommend this if you want new and softer skin. Not sure if wrinkles go away but still like it alot</li>
    <li> So easy to work with, i have seen the effects on the skin, that is the reason why i purchased it, the tips are made of glass, so easy to clean with careful. it does what it suppose to do. i like it, i love it. and excellent price.!!!</li>
    <li> I love it! I feel that a person must be diligent and use on a routine basis for the best results.</li>
    <li> The mushroom was broken when I got it.  So, I couldn&#x27;t use it from day one.  Send it back, got the refund.  But I wish that it was not broken.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as any device in a spa setting. Only comes with orange wands, would love add on option to also get purple ones</li>
    <li> Absolutely fantastic skin care machine, I use in addition to my microcurrent and LED light therapy machines.&lt;br /&gt;People guess me at 32-38 years old, I contribute this to the use of my machines, Including this one, and my own&lt;br /&gt;anti-aging serum that I create.  Love using the D&#x27;arsonval machine also for my scalp, as it rejuvenates and refreshes,&lt;br /&gt;encouraging the hair to grow a bit faster.  I sing for my Stevie Nicks/Fleetwood Mac tribute band, White Winged Dove,&lt;br /&gt;and when you are on that stage, you must have BIG hair and beautiful skin.  My machine helps that happen :)&lt;br /&gt;PS: I will be 55 on 09/14/2015 :)</li>
    <li> I am 44 years old  my skin was dull and sagging a bit I have only used this product for three days and already I have noticed results  . I was not expecting any results for at least a month if any to be honest . I have already had people complement me on my skin I have been told I have a youthful glow and that I look great .  The D&#x27;arsonval High frequency machine is wonderful and for less than half the cost of other products . I would recommend this product for most anyone . :)</li>
    <li> Yes the product comes from Asia---and w/ some &amp;#34;interesting&amp;#34; instructions. Do some research on the HF wands and watch videos on youtube as well as read the reviews on how to use it properly. It&#x27;s only 3 minutes a day. Just wash the glass ends in hot soapy water when done and towel dry. Don&#x27;t twist the electrodes into place, just push them into the wand and gently pull them out when done. My pores look much smaller, my skin brighter, and I zap &amp;#34;soon to be&amp;#34; zips back to where they came from. Great product at a super great price!</li>
    <li> I am a professional esthetician and I was really skeptical about ordering this product and thought it might not serve its purpose since it is for home use. But having experienced with the professional set and this, I can say that it exceeded my expectation. I can&#x27;t even tell the difference between the this and a professional set.The rods fit in nice and snug. I would definitely recommend using this. Especially if you have oily/congested skin.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  August 6, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company&#x27;s ad refers to the D&#x27;arsonvale device, has multiple pictures of the device and 4 wands, and links to these comment reviews, which are ALL of the entire device and 4 wands.  Previously, they were actually selling the device and 4 wands, which as you can see many people were happy with.  Including me.  I needed to replace the device, went back to the SAME link from my previous purchase, checked the reviews again, and put in my order.  The company only sent me one lousy glass wand.  THIS IS EXTREMELY AND DELIBERATELY MISLEADING.  DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY.  THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THESE REVIEWS CORRECTLY PORTRAY WHAT THE COMPANY IS NOW SELLING.</li>
    <li> I have had it for about a month.  I am not sure if it works, but it seems too give me a bit of a glow. I would definitely buy it again.  I had to go on youtube to figure out how to use it.  It is delicate, so just be gentle with it and you will be fine.  :)</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I have ever bought for ageing , great for wrinkles &amp; firming , and no pain at all , I started with a low setting at first being a little scared ,but whit in seconds I was useing the highest setting ! This thing is awesome !</li>
    <li> I have used it for two weeks and have seen  lot of  improvement in my skin and hair.  The problem  I had was with the instructions.  They are totally uncomprehensible.  I  could&#x27;nt  make  head or  tail of them.  After two weeks the shiny bottom of the mushroom tube&lt;br /&gt;came off inside the hand set,  so that was the end of my treatment.  The instructions say that only their company  can do the repairs, I dont know if I  want to go through the hassle of that.  I am happy  with the results of the product so I am thinking of ordering another one,  but I hate losing my money on it.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a fairly small kit based upon the picture so when I got it I initially thought there had been some mistake.  This thing is huge! I eventually figured out this was what I ordered.  No thanks to the directions which are extremely limited.  Search YouTube for what you need to know about this product.  I&#x27;ve used it on and off for the last three weeks and honestly I don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
    <li> This is my first time writing a review.  I guess I didn&#x27;t really have a reason to before.  But since the company I ordered this from charged me a restocking fee for a product that should not have been restocked because it was defective and did not work any more after about the sixth time I used it.  I gave this a two star rating only because I do not like the word &amp;#34;hate&amp;#34; and that describes a one star rating.  So beware about ordering this product.</li>
    <li> I used this for two weeks. I wanted it to work so bad. It made my skin look horrible.  I had big red splotches and more acne than I started with. Now I have little brown marks on my skin that seem permanent.  There are no instructions for this. I did 2 reviews on Youtube under the name mzcagomea.&lt;br /&gt;I looked up a bunch of stuff and found out this is not for cancer survivors. I guess our skin changes with treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use it if you have&lt;br /&gt;Heart issues&lt;br /&gt;Pacemaker&lt;br /&gt;Metal in your body&lt;br /&gt;Cancer&lt;br /&gt;Diabetes&lt;br /&gt;Pregnant&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t wear jewelry while you use it.&lt;br /&gt;You will also need a mesh for your face. It can be used with or without a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;This was not good for me but I have had chemotherapy and radiation in the past so my skin is very sensitive.  Good luck</li>
    <li> Update on my original review.  I finally got over the fear and used it once so far.  Of course no results are expected yet, but just want to let you know it was surprisingly painless, however, the smallest attachment was a little uncomfortable at the lowest setting, just used it on a few tiny bumps to see if it helps.  While the other attachments didn&#x27;t really hurt, I did feel a slight warmth in a few areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to use it 2-3 times a week.  My face was a little red the day after but went away.  I don&#x27;t know if this machine had anything to do with this, but I actually felt a surge of energy after using this and got a lot done around the house, normally I&#x27;m totally wiped out.  Probably just coincidence but I&#x27;ll know for sure after more regular use :)&lt;br /&gt;_________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;January 26, 2013:  3 stars based on mostly seemingly good reviews, I&#x27;ll update after some uses.  Just a little puzzled by this product, no brand name on the package, very poor instructions, and just discovered this exact same tool and attachments are also sold under a different name as an electrosex kit, wtf?!  Makes me wonder if it was invented as a sex toy, then someone realized it helps skin problems, or the other way around lol.  Not into sexual electrocution so I think I&#x27;ll just try it out for what I purchased it for and see how that goes.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit and unfortunately the merchandise was damaged stored in the amazon ware house. They offered me a full refund to buy another one. That was pretty nice of them. It was more than I expected. I really like this unit also. Nice that the company backs up the product and ensures customer service as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this item for about a month, and liked the results.  Until today, when it stopped working.  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Do not buy this.  It broke after 2 months and now the seller says it&#x27;s passed the return date.  How convenient for them. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Instructions are in broken English.Waste of time, money, and effort. No instructions on how to return this piece of crap. It did come in a nice box - for that, I&#x27;ll give it 1 star.</li>
    <li> This product should not be on a consumer market site. This unit comes with glass conductor tubes very dangerous easy to break and virtually no instructions except that it should be used by a trained estetician. I would hope that Amazon would at least remove it from prime.</li>
    <li> For the price, I expected a toy,  but it works really good, I owned a professional one,  and there are not a big difference between them,  I recomend for personal use,  it is the second that I bought for a gift,  do his work and arrives soon....</li>
    <li> for the price this is a grate machine I bought a 500$ one a few years back and it did not work as well as this one</li>
    <li> This high frequency is really helpfull when I get some pimpels or eruptions or infections on my skin, it helps inmediately to desinfect my skin, I cant see any help for wrinkles but for people with oily skin this is great.</li>
    <li> It seems to be a nice product but there were some health issues they addressed that I felt might not fit my needs.</li>
    <li> What do you know. . .this is surprisingly effective.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and can definitely discern that my face looks firmer and more lifted.  I use it most days, for 5-10 minutes.  I do use lifting techniques gleaned from 30 minutes on You Tube.  My jawline looks more taut and the little marionette folds I was starting to see by my nose are much improved.  No impact on my under eye circles though, bummer.  My hubs says that I look 5-10 years younger.  As a 40 something, I&#x27;ll take it!  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of stuff, this is a winner in my book.  For the cost, definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> Great fun. Not sure of its medicinal effectiveness but this is not what we use it for.</li>
    <li> This products hurts when you use it. It also causes a burn if you leave it on in one area too much and smells like burnt flesh after using it.</li>
    <li> I like this so far but the reason I only gave it 3 stars is the glass piece that looks like a comb for the scalp and hair arrived broken in 2 pieces.  Also, the instructions leave a lot to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using it very long and I am not sure if it&#x27;s the Argan Oil or this that&#x27;s improving the look of my skin but my neck looks much better and the wrinkles in my face seem to be less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to contact the seller and would have returned it due to the broken piece but with the shipping cost I decided to just keep it. I would like the piece that is broke to be replaced but I don&#x27;t see that happening. If it does I will update this review.</li>
    <li> Everytime I have zits, I just use this for 2 to 3 consecutive days (along with my other acne products)..whola, its gone! Very effective.</li>
    <li> Like they say, not every product is meant for everyone. Or maybe I need to use it more religiously before concluding anything. Bottomline - I purchased this machine to help heal my cystic acnes, every time I could see a bump arising i went to my aesthetician and she would do a high-frequency and somehow the bump disappears next day so I bought this machine assuming all high-frequency machine might be able to do the same job. Apparently not, I used this machine twice a day for straight 10 days on every cystic bump i have on my forehead and cheek- nothing happened, literally nothing. New acnes kept on coming and the old ones were painful and here to stay, somehow this machine didnt help at all :(&lt;br /&gt;Using it was not a rocket science so I am okay with the instructions, no big deal but overall i didnt get any expected results. Now that my acne are slowly healing, I will try to use this again and see if there is any change in my complexion or tone or other potential acnes.</li>
    <li> The D&#x27;arsonval High Frequency really helps tighten skin and lighten dark spots.  It&#x27;s not exactly comfortable to use, but the results can be seen instantly.  I use it for about 10 minutes a day and am very satisfied with the results.  I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and see a firming and tightening of the skin on my face.</li>
    <li> After using at least 3 times per week for a month no visible result noted. I bought specifically for puffy eyes but the bags are still apparent as before</li>
    <li> This is a promising device. It worked for a couple of days and even though I treated it gently, the metal end of one of the attachments stayed inside in the machine when I pulled out the attachment. Am having to return it, hence the 3 stars. In the few days I it worked, I began to see major lifting taking place. My skin feels tighter and my neck looks better. I can imagine fantastic results if used long term. Too bad it&#x27;s not very well made. Returning today, sorry to say.</li>
    <li> Maybe I just don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing but I had to stop using it. At first it seemed like my face felt good, clean and refreshed. After using it only 3 times, once a week, my face broke out real bad in one area. I have had a bad break out for months just in that one spot. Afraid to use again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful tool for esthetics.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints. It does what it says it will do. Be careful if you have a pacemaker or defibrillator.</li>
    <li> works incredibly well! Great price!</li>
    <li> I used it for about one month noticed nothing. although it dried my skin ,and burned my face. very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I got this in good order and reviewed that part of the deal as excellent.&lt;br /&gt;The device? NOT SO MUCH.&lt;br /&gt;I used it for 3 months before I gave up. NO RESULTS.&lt;br /&gt;NO RESULTS - NONE - ZIP&lt;br /&gt;I used it vigorously and often, according to instruction, then according to more detailed instructions on YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to sell it to kinky friends as a sex toy, aka the &amp;#34;violet Wand&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s useless for skin.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!!  I&#x27;m so glad I was open minded enough to buy it.  Worth every penny.  I recorded a video showing before and after pictures of my neck to prove that this product works.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;9dLZSwDJ2XA</li>
    <li> It is ok.  No miracle worker!  I had hoped for better results.  I used it regularly morning and night and didn&#x27;t really see any great results.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my acne, which has worked on a few spots but not all.  I am too chicken to turn the power to the highest setting to zap my deeper cystic pimples.  However, for my smaller zits, they were gone the next day.  For any anti-aging affects I have yet to see.</li>
    <li> I have spent thousands on laser and chemical peel treatments.  This product  is awesome!  I was skeptical but come on- for less than $30 bucks it was worth a try.  My skin definitely looks better after each use.  I&#x27;m not sure there is any long term affect but that&#x27;s true even with a laser treatment.  Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> When you first use it, you should put it on a super low setting until you get used to it:) I had it on high and shocked the heck out of my face lol</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Product as described. Instructions are confusing though, as they appear to be written by someone with who&#x27;s first language is not English.</li>
    <li> Metal fitting on probe came off while being used the first time.  Fitting was hot glued on to probe.  Probe was to large to for metal fitting to properly seat.  Returning immediately.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference it actually made me break  out however returning it was very simple wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for the puffy under eyes, made wrinkles worse and more noticeable, even with cerave left face dry</li>
    <li> Loved it at first but the leaf attachment and mushroom attachment don&#x27;t seem to be working as well as they did when I first received it. Disappointed in the quality. Maybe I just got a couple of faulty pieces.&lt;br /&gt;BUMMER.&lt;br /&gt;Stacy V</li>
    <li> No CLEAR (English) instructions.  How long to use it, how far from skin, etc. Will keep trying to use it.</li>
    <li> I should send it back but not worth the time one wand broke out of the box been using it for a few weeks not worth the money</li>
    <li> while i did not have a quick wrinkle fix, i did notice the small wrinkles diminishing somewhat. in time perhaps the larger wrinkles will be affected. places that seemed to have the skin tighten did not stay tightened for more than a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am very familiar with the salves and tonic alternatives used for cancers. for a few months i have had a small blemish on my face and i was coming to realize i should test it with a dab of salve to see if it was abnormal.  when i received this device i decided to use it during the hour a day i watch Korean soap operas, since you use it for a minute or so on an area then move it around, etc.&lt;br /&gt;i had only used it for 2 or 3 days when i saw that the blemish and another spot i could feel but not see anything there, had come up to a raised area and then formed a scab which opened to release fluid, exactly as black salve would have done to remove an abnormal growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in a few days i noticed three more tiny spots that has scabbed but were too small to produce oozing.  the two larger spots continued to produce ooze and now are pink areas of about 1/8 in diameter and are healing, and likely to heal without a visible scar. the tiny spots are slightly pink but almost invisible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think this is a great way to bring out abnormal skin irregularities when they are not yet visible, and get rid of them easily.  i imagine that the effect does not go deep enough to deal with more established irregularities, but it might let you know they existed  and you could treat them with something that goes deeper, such as a drop of black salve diluted with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in my opinion, with over a decade of experience helping others and their pets, these spots were skin cancers. but  it may be better to not know for certain and treat then with an alternative as &#x27;abnormal cells&#x27;  rather than to confirm what they are and make claims that could be considered illegal.</li>
    <li> Not happy with the product no instructions 1 little pamplet that says says very little about all the attatchments !No customer service&lt;br /&gt;number, would not recomend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for weeks now and I&#x27;m not sure if it has any effects on me. I still don&#x27;t seee any visible improvement so for now, I&#x27;ll just be neutral and will update this comment once I see any changes (good or bad)</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this skin care tool. I went by the reviews and wasn&#x27;t disappointed . I&#x27;ve noticed the skin above my eyelid is not sagging like it was and I can see my eyelid . I&#x27;m 54 and not real old ,but starting to see age to my skin . I have trouble with the skin on my neck starting to sag and I&#x27;ve even noticed a difference there. I know it will take longer for this area because there&#x27;s a lot of skin to work with . I&#x27;m also using a book I got through Amazon called Facelift at your fingertips: An Aromatherapy Massage program for your skin . You use essential oil and use the massage techniques they show in the book . They tell about different skin types, etc. . .&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I recommend The High Frequency Tool as one way to help your skin .</li>
    <li> I knew from reading the reviews that it was a risky buy, since the directions are translated (poorly). But it just freaks me out to much to even use it. Maybe would be fine for someone who already understood how to use the different tools, but I regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> Just one word...Excellent!!!</li>
    <li> The product is what i was looking for my skin. Works great!! Very pro, excelent. I use it 2 times per day without creams.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Love it! Great results in less than 3 weeks. I use it in the morning and at night, before going to sleep with creams and  wrinkles have diminished considerably. Also my chin looks tight! Yes! I did have a few breakouts initially, but I simply decreased the use in those areas and they went away.</li>
    <li> We use this same model in my Esthetics school and I love all of the functions of this machine. Treating acne, stimulating collagen, stimulating hair growth- I use it at least twice a week. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I am using it almost daily.  I am seeing new hair growing in where my hair was getting thin.  I also used it on spots on my skin and they seem to be disappearing.  I would recommend this, only like with anything, you need to be consistent in using it.</li>
    <li> I like this thing.  I think if I could stick to it I would see good results.  When I have used it my skin looks better and I look refreshed.  I think I&#x27;ll work at using it regularly and then come back with more info.  P.S. I&#x27;m 66 years old too.</li>
    <li> I have yet to really see incredible results,  I have not had it that long,  but I think the device is pretty cool.</li>
    <li> My comments after reading the reviews and using it myself for three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read about a process called Thermage to understand that the benefits are not intended to be seen immediately.  I had a few Thermage treatment in a doctor&#x27;s office, very expensive and painful, where it was explained to me that it TAKES TIME for the underlying collagen to regenerate. You may not see any reversal of aging, but more likely the reduction of aging by building the collagen beneath. The Thermage treatment places the wand directly on the skin to penetrate the underlying layers, which is how you should be using this machine, and moving the wand slowly over the trouble areas to allow the heat to penetrate.  If you lift it, not only will you get that painful snapping effect, but you&#x27;re sending the heat onto the skin, not into it as you should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for its safety and operation, you can no more electrocute yourself with it than you can with any other electrical appliance--just be sensible and don&#x27;t throw it in the bathtub. Mine came beautifully boxed, all intact, and seems to operate as it should--no reduction or fluctuation in power.  My only caution is the fragility of the wands, so since I prefer the mushroom, I leave it in the machine and store it carefully in a spare drawer.  I also recommend NOT touching the stem of the wand while it&#x27;s operating, not because it will hurt you, but it&#x27;s a little startling and may cause you to drop the wand. Since the proper amount of time has not yet passed to see how effective this is in comparison with the full-fledged Thermage, I can only give it four stars.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because of the good reviews listed, so I wanted to share hoping to help others.  This is a great machine and does what it says at a fraction of the cost of the one I almost bought.  Don&#x27;t expect a face-lift because this is just not surgery.  But, I think by adding this to a beauty regimen is a great thing to do, I see a difference after about a week and a half; fresher looking skin and.... I think its looking firmer.  I say &amp;#34;I think&amp;#34; because I cannot tell if it is wishful thinking or if there really is something there.  I use olive oil on my face and neck so the apparatus moves around easier.  In addition to this I do facial exercises, facial massage during my daily scrub, and I drink vegetable juice to ensure I get enough nutrients for my body to make the necessary collagen to keep skin firmer.  I think when put together, they all contribute to my skin&#x27;s health.</li>
    <li> This is the strangest product I&#x27;ve ever used.  And the directions are a joke!  But I managag to figure this thing out. I&#x27;m 62 yrs old and everyone tells me I have lovely skin. They don&#x27;t notice my wrinkles and little sagging,but I sure do. I&#x27;ve used this three times so far. I must say it does plump and firm the skin nicely. I noticed minor improvements,but I think with regular use I &#x27;ll get better and better results. If you purchase this, be sure and use a good light weight skin cream,for nice smooth contact. Hope this is helpful.</li>
    <li> Saved me $$ on dumb Dr.s visits. I had an infection that wouldn&#x27;t go away and a friend suggested high frequency light. Super idea !</li>
    <li> Works wonderful 😍 in love with this product</li>
    <li> Seems to work well so far especially if used daily, and using it on acne and exzema works very well</li>
    <li> When will foreign manufacturers learn what a turn-off foolish translations are? I&amp;#34;m sure folks who watch porn know some application techniques, but skin care requires a bit more delicacy. The product functions as it should.One of the tips separated from its base when I removed it from the power unit, but it was a simple job for superglue.</li>
    <li> Since our student estheticians used one on me, I&#x27;ve been looking for an at home hf machine. This one may not be as advanced or have the same gas as the one I&#x27;m used to, but it works perfectly! I&#x27;m amazed at how quickly my acne lesions are healing. It is on the loud side, though. Nothing to worry about. Just loud humming.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed is the instruction booklet appears to be poorly translated into English. The quality of the booklet doesn&#x27;t reflect the quality of the product! It came packaged as pictured with all pieces fully intact. The nodes are easy to change, too. Perfect solution for home facials.</li>
    <li> I love this machine.  I have already gotten tons of compliments.  Everyone wants to know what I have been using. My skin glows like it did in my 20&#x27;s and I have only been using it once a day for a week. My acne is gone, my skin tone has evened out, my sun spots have faded, and my pores look smaller. I have used it on my face, neck, chest, and hands to fade reddish scars. I can also zap a zit and it will be nearly gone the next day. It has healed my flakey scalp and stopped my hair loss. There is a light metalic smell when the machine is in use, and it comes basically with no instructions.  There are quite a few Youtube video&#x27;s and alot of helpful reviews that will help to guide you thru the process if you have questions. This machine has totally transformed my skin. I will be a loyal user for life!</li>
    <li> this is a great machine. It will certainly help, but you have to use it every day. I worked in a spa where high frequency treatments were 125.00 to 200.00..so I do love having one at my home for such a remarkable price.</li>
    <li> You probably shouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this item. I ended up sending it back. it didn&#x27;t work. meaning that it would not turn on.</li>
    <li> The wand seems to work.  Unfortunately, I have not used it consistently.  Did not see immediate results. Will repost if I get results</li>
    <li> I paid $90 for a Derma Wand on ebay; however, it came in and didn&#x27;t work at all. It wouldn&#x27;t even power up, so I returned it and got a refund. Then I found this machine, which seemed to be similar and was MUCH MUCH CHEAPER!!! So I bought this and I can tell you, it looks EXACTLY like the derma wand. Even the attachments that come with it are the same. The only difference is that the derma wand is black and this is white. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE DERMA WAND, WHEN THIS IS THE SAME EXACT THING FOR LESS THAN HALF THE PRICE!!! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time, but I have noticed subtle differences in my skin. Primary purpose I bought it for was to fade scars I have and although not a quick fix, I can say that it is slowly helping.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 46years old mom. She absolutely loves this thing. She used to paid 10 dlls per session with the exactly same  High frequency machine at the spa.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first but I use this every evening and morning for about 5 minutes, working on my quite evident laugh lines and neck lines.  I did notice that the skin folds were less evident in the light.  The noise is slightly disconcerting (like sparking sounds) but once you get use to it, not a problem.  Just make sure you keep contact with the tool to the skin or else small minute shocks will occur at the skin.  Not painful, but it does shock you.  Will continue utilizing.</li>
    <li> Very nice materials, good quality</li>
    <li> This is not strong enough for salon use.&lt;br /&gt;We love our old ones. I wish I could find them.&lt;br /&gt;no</li>
    <li> The instructions are not clear but I researched it online.  It does work but you have to use it regularly.</li>
    <li> I discontinued use because I saw an increase in facial sagging. I believe initially it plumps your skin due to inflammation and once you start, you would probably have to use it forever to maintain plumpness. I&#x27;m worried about the long term damage. It smells like ozone which is know to cause oxidation.</li>
    <li> I could not understand the directions.  They were obviously translated and very poorly.  There were no pictures to clarify. When I got to the part that &amp;#34;sparkles&amp;#34; may occur, I said &amp;#34;no thank you&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It will take sometime after you begin to use this product to see any result, but hang in there.  Someone else wrote a review saying &amp;#34;watch the video.&amp;#34;  This is VERY helpful and will give you the confidence and knowledge of wht to do and not to do.</li>
    <li> this didn&#x27;t really come with instructions for use. I eventually found instructions for dermawand which says twice a day. I used it once a day, most days. I have been using it regularly for a month now. I know they say it takes 3-6 mos to see results from rebuilding collegen. but so far, I have been pleased as it has been keeping my skin pretty clear. if I do get a blemish, this thing causes it to dry up and heal quickly. I am 52 and had been using retinal but it tends to make my eyes puffy.  I stopped using the retinol and since I have been using this instead it seems to have made my skin smoother and plumper. the plumping helps diminish fine lines. I have not seen any difference on wrinkles. slight softening of sagging in the lower face due to the plumping effect, perhaps. quite frankly, I do not feel comfortable using it around my eyes too closely. . it does make my skin look more vibrant. probably because of the increased circulation from the zapping.  I do use it on the highest setting. I do not find it painful. less painful than like plucking.  for the price, I think its great.  ok its been 3 months of using it once a day for short periods in the am. the results are not dramatic but it is nice. i decided since i did see some nice results with this device and RF seems to work for my skin, to invest in a larger unit. significantly more expensive, but still a LOT less expensive than even one treatment at &amp;#34;spas&amp;#34; and doctors offices. i plan to keep using this unit tho. especially if i have to travel or to slip in something quick. The larger unit is less frequent treatments which will better fit my schedule.  I think this unit is good bang for the buck.  its ridiculously inexpensive, considering!  :)</li>
    <li> Its a little scary with foreign directions. I contacted seller but answers did not help me feel confident to use it so I never have??</li>
    <li> I use this after my at home facials to help heal acne spots. It doesn&#x27;t hurt but I&#x27;m not sure it does much. My esthetician uses one on me when I go to the salon for a facial so it must do something. She swears it helps with acne spots.</li>
    <li> This product dried my face out big time!  I can&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone at all.  I would send it back but lost my receipt.</li>
    <li> I can see visible changes in skin such as the puffiness under my eyes has disappeared with continuous use. Yes Im happy with this device.</li>
    <li> Used this a few times and noticed a huge difference in my skin. It has so many documented uses. Also love the packaging.</li>
    <li> Price was right. Have been using product daily, without fail.  Adding this 15 minutes to my daily regime has been worth the effort, The changes are SLOW  but SURE, not an overnight miracle but skin tightening is evident, Patience is the key to success.</li>
    <li> I cant tell if it&#x27;s causing any improvement.  It definitely buzzes on my skin, but when do the wrinkles start to soften?</li>
    <li> This product does tighten the skin, clear up acne,de crease wrinkles ,etc.  Be very cautious when you use this product, electric shocks hurt!</li>
    <li> I do not see a change  since I started using it daily  for 3?  weeks  Are thise enough words?  ok</li>
    <li> Whilest using the product, the tone of the frequency changed.  I turned it off.  Unplugged it and noticed the wand was crooked.  I wrapped a tissue around the wand and gently twisted it out, only to find that the metal base remained in the apparatus.  I had only just started using it.</li>
    <li> i got my derma wand 2 weeks ago and I use 2 times a day and I love it..i saw the reviews on this a couple of days ago on here and on tou tube and decided to try it.Its not expensive so I just got this this morning and all I can say it wow!! it has more power than the derma wand! I love the attachments also!! even after using it I can still feel it working!! I recommend this to everyone!! don&#x27;t just take my word for it-do some home work on this cause honestly I think its the best product against wrinkles!!!</li>
    <li> You can tell it&#x27;s working right away. For acne it was drying to the skin which is really good. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell if it does anything for wrinkles. But it&#x27;s the same quality as I had and beauty school. Great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> You know a product is going to be questionable when the packaging is filled with barely-readable language. This product didn&#x27;t even turn on and didn&#x27;t work at all. It was a complete waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t ordinarily bother to leave reviews for products that I buy here, but I&#x27;m hoping I save someone their hard-earned cash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician that trained in a spa for school this is just as good as the professional ones in the spa just make sure you know what you&#x27;re doing and how to use it! :)</li>
    <li> This product really helps my blemishes heal up faster.&lt;br /&gt;It is also very easy to use.  The directions could be more specific, but overall I am Very impressed!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my acne, but had to stop using it once I found out I was pregnant. Since then, my husband has been using it on his psoriasis and on his scalp to help with flaking. It works great! I can&#x27;t wait to go back to using this!</li>
    <li> Age 40. Extremely surprised. Results are not immediate however I have measured a difference after 3 uses. Must keep regimen regular to continue to see results. It has evened out my pores and tightened the skin around my eyes and jaw line. Note: results are minimal and not as effective as if you used a professional device. I have been using this about 4 months now.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product about two months ago. The HF technology for skin is new to me so I went online to view users&#x27; feedback and also watch You-tube to see how to use it correctly. I even asked a plastic surgeon about the technology.  I used it daily about 5 minutes or less, and my facial skin seems tight and rejuvenated after a week or so. I also used the comb to brush my hair for a minute or so in the morning and found it made me felt as if I drank a cup of coffee - feel alert and energetic for the whole morning. I rate this product as 4 stars since to my surprise, I couldn&#x27;t find any manufacture information on the package.  And the instruction booklet is also very simple and I have to search online to get detailed instructions from other users. Since it works well, I would recommend this product to my friends. But I would not want to over use it.</li>
    <li> I used this for months and never saw any effect whatsoever, I used it at all strengths even the highest.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what else to say. Maybe it works for other, but not me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after my friend raved about the effects she felt she had achieved using the Derma Wand. I found this on Amazon and it seemed like the technology was very similar to the Derma Wand, but much cheaper. I had read the reviews and they seemed encouraging. After using it faithfully every day for 3 weeks, I did NOT see a bit of difference in my skin at ALL! And not only were the wrinkles not affected, I have a slight liver spot on my cheek that was not diminished, and small wrinkles on my upper lip were also virtually unchanged. I was furious and I was ready to send it back. Then, one day I was putting on makeup and I put on under eye concealer, which I have to wear due to naturally dark circles under my eyes. I think it is hereditary and I have never found anything to alleviate this problem, which seems to have worsened with age. I have had to cover with heavy under eye makeup for years now. But lo and behold, one day, after using this for several weeks, I did notice that my circles were concealed and eliminated with 1 light pass of the under concealer!!! I thought it was in my mind. Normally, it would take me 3 or 4 layers of concealer, followed by power to conceal my circles. They are very dark. I thought maybe it was my imagination, and watched it for another week, and sure enough my circles are DEFINITELY lighter. Still I was not easily convinced or wanting to give credit to this machine in error,so I decided to stop using this for awhile and see what happened. I stop using it for 5 days in a row and my circles were getting darker again! I am convinced that this is helping my undereye circles and that is a blessing!!!!!!! I AM SO THRILLED THAT I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO WEAR UNDER EYE CONCEALER ALL OF THE TIME ANYMORE. I used to wear it every day, even just around the house, without any other makeup because I looked so haggard and unhealthy from them. This machine does not do what it said it would do, however. And it will dry out your skin horribly and so I finally got Palmer&#x27;s Oil for Face to use with it. But, the fact that it helped lighten my under eye circles makes it darn near priceless to me!!!!!!!!!! THANK GOODNESS I DIDN&#x27;T SEND IT BACK.</li>
    <li> This is a Good product, it came quickly, and it is going to be fun to play with. I just wish it could come in black.</li>
    <li> I fell for it. I tried it. I went to a facial and the professional even suggested it. but I used it regularly and saw no reaction at all.</li>
    <li> Actually I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really tell yet</li>
    <li> There is a wide price range for these units, I have found that there is no difference in quality. I use it for everything from facials, which I do for a living, to sprained ankles. I healed my dogs leg in a day, he got in fight with my other dog and was bitten on the leg, the next morning it was swollen and infected and he wasn&#x27;t using it. I did the light on his leg 4 times throughout the day, that evening he jumped out of the truck and was walking fine and no swelling. It&#x27;s the most useful thing I have ever had without a doubt.</li>
    <li> Love this I use it every day I also bought one for my daughter she loves it also.Good product for the money</li>
    <li> I like it I am using it for thin hair &amp; I really lke it Only been a couple of weeks its great</li>
    <li> The price was right so I gave it a try. I would give the product a one star as it caused my 58 year old skin to break out in large, quarter to half dollar sized under the skin pockets of liquid.  They weren&#x27;t quite zits or cists, but maybe a cist is a more accurate term.  Needless to say, the only youthful appearance I received was reverting back to teen acne days.  I gave it three stars because we received a full refund from the company, so in that I am happy.</li>
    <li> I love this!  I use it to keep the skin on my face tight so it won&#x27;t sag with my age.  It makes my skin look so much younger.  It is also good for other skin problems such as rashes.</li>
    <li> There was no instruction booklet to inform the user of  how long the product should be used at one setting (time) also&lt;br /&gt;if there any possibility of damage if used longer than  X amount of minutes, should it be used more than 6 times ( X ) per/week</li>
    <li> Despite reading other reviews about the D&#x27;arsonval High frequency device, I did not consider this a high frequency device because it uses gas in a glass tube.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Works great!  Worth every penny!  I told all my friends about it &amp; now they are getting one!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t use this.  I opened box, it looked like it would have some effect if used properly.  I decided to return it, because I&#x27;m going to have surgery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about every other day because I read somewhere that high frequency can be drying.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really working.  I don&#x27;t see drastic improvement.  But it hasn&#x27;t been that long so I&#x27;m keeping an open mind.</li>
    <li> This works great for many different  skin afflictions .  It also works on helping to get over sinus infections. It helps by bringing more oxygen to your skin.  It was shipped quickly and with no problems .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a novice and this is my first purchase of any &amp;#34;at home use&amp;#34; treatment instrument. I took the time to watch the &amp;#34;nastypuppy&amp;#34; video below and went to the derma-wand site to read it&#x27;s instructions. I am 53. My skin is not in bad shape, some wrinkles, but like my mom, my skin is starting to sag, parentheses from nose to lips, the edges of my lips turning downward and washboard lines above nose/between eyebrows. Organic virgin coconut oil was my choice of moisturizer to use with the D&#x27;arsonval. (First I cleansed my face thoroughly) I was not sure how long to use it, I didn&#x27;t see that info anywhere. I used it for about 5 minutes on each side of my face. I am not sure if I had it set as high as I should have, but I did turn it up a few times. There was no sensation while I was doing it, only when I lifted it to return for another swipe. I hope to use this daily, or every other. The parentheses are screaming at me whenever I look in the mirror, but I don&#x27;t have the money to spend on a mini face lift. I intend to return and update this post with results. I took a picture today also. On the derma-wand site it did have a list of chemicals in facial products that you should stay away from while using this. I have the Watts Beauty 100% Hyaluronic acid solution (from Amazon). Would that be something I should consider trying with the D&#x27;arsonal? If you have any advise, please, feel free to comment.</li>
    <li> It comes with little instruction on how to use it.  The ones that are give are written poorly and it is up to the customer to figure out how to use the product.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Ive practiced with many high frequency machines, even professional ones at 4 times the amount and this one is excellent!  I was a bit skeptical at first because of the price but I figured if it didnt work out than I will use it for home use.  The main reason I use this machine for myself as well as on others is for its germicidal effect on the pores.  In other words its great for acne.  Im not kidding when I say \\&quot; A zit today...gone tomorrow!! \\&quot; LOL.  Im not so sure on its ability to get rid of wrinkles or smooth skin, but it definitely  will clear the complexion up nicely.  Also,  It is not unusual that it is very hard to put the electrodes in and out of the handle, just be careful that the glass does not break in your hand ( it can ).  And lastly, its a good idea if your using this machine for zit reasons to do the extractions first and then use this.  I like to turn mine up almost all the way with the mushroom electrode, but if you are sparking then use the long skinny one only as high as you can tolerate.  Have fun....Im addicted!!!!!</li>
    <li> It took longer then 10 days to get product, seams like a good product (isn&#x27;t made cheep), but I&#x27;m getting ready to return it, it shows that its the purple/ violet UV rays and its NOT its orange! Was totally bummed out! Other then that, no problems, other then it took weeks to arive .</li>
    <li> This thing is a lot of fun! It kinda tickles when used on the back. Good for a sensation starter. ;)</li>
    <li> I use this machine quite regularly and have noticed improvements in many areas. I have had this for about 3 weeks and use it about every other day with Glycerin oil to help the electrodes glide evenly over the skin. It doesn&#x27;t hurt or burn, it tingles a little. totally safe.</li>
    <li> I just received this product and I have to say, the level of idiocy in the printed words on the box and the nonsensical directions inside. For instance, on the box,&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;...which can in instantaneous Thoroughly eliminate all kinds of spot on the face and on skin surface, Such as old age spots, freckles, granules, tattoos, moles, etc, the effect is obviousWith on bleeding or scar leff.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;These lines are verbatim, capitalizations, spacing and all. WTF!?&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m just too damn scared to use it.</li>
    <li> THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST PURCHASE I HAVE EVER MADE GREAT PRICE WORKS GREAT NO INTRUCTIONS NEEDED.  SO GLAD I MADE THIS PURCHASE.</li>
    <li> This product is nothing short of amazing. Here&#x27;s why... First of the pricepoint is a complete joke for what you are getting here. I recently had to stop getting regular facials  because my financial situation changed drastically. I had to find products that were effective and affordable. This is one of them. I also have used the dermawand which is great for travel as it is much smaller than this but its so much more expensive! This product brightens the face., kills bacteria on the skin( in my case in the form of blackheads), softens fine lines and wrinkles.. and opens up the eye quite a bit as well. I use la roche posay duo action acne treatment with this priduct. In addition I use aztec healing clay as a mask,  so I expensive as well and its used with apple cider vinegar.  I also use la roche posay anti relapse and redermic r. As it is the best substitute for my long time expensive long time retin a use. You will love this product. Look at how to use online . Theres a u tube video that will explain all of it to you as their insert directions arent clear at all. I think the product must come from france perhaps.</li>
    <li> Was not argon gas - was just neon&lt;br /&gt;I returned it with out problems&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend it for professional work</li>
    <li> ok, I am a nonbeliever but, I just got a new job at 60 and want to look my best. So I got this, first time of use and the deep lines between my eyes were plumper. I didn&#x27;t use oil or cream, since my face is a little oily anyway. and I started at a higher setting because I could not feel anything. But, it is working will keep using this I may get a new me.</li>
    <li> Such poor packing. One of the probs came broken. The device works well and other probs are good so I kept it because I was lazy to return and get the replacement.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this, hoping it would help with hair loss. The second night I used it, the glass comb came out of the device and broke in several pieces. I cannot find anywhere on the box or in limited paperwork where to purchase a replacement comb.</li>
    <li> After spending hundreds of dollars on facials, cleansers, acne systems, and prescription medication, nothing cleared up my adult cystic acne until this!  I love it and highly recommend it.  Totally worked for me.  I started using it 3 months ago and have not had a single new outbreak ever since.  I use it 1-2 times per day.  Yes, the instructions are wonky and poorly written, so I just Youtub&#x27;ed how to use it.  This product saved my skin and my skin has never looked better.  I HIGHLY recommend it.  It&#x27;s been a miracle for me.</li>
    <li> I just received this yesterday, and it came with a euro plug.  I don&#x27;t feel like going through the process of sending it back and ordering another one, so I will stop today and get a converter.  So after I get to use it, I will alter my review to more positive if it works well.  Still annoyed that it didn&#x27;t come with a U.S. plug.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these to use like micro current at the spa. The directions are written by someone who speaks poor English and doesn&#x27;t really make sense. I&#x27;m a Physical Therapist we do E-stim so I got the concept of the product. I use avocado oil and vitamin E oil for my conductor. When used consistently this product will help retrain the muscles in the face and neck. Help increase collagen growth and create a more youthful appearance.</li>
    <li> I had trouble sleeping keyword had with this be prepared to have a great nights sleep. It also helped with my acne. Best of all it feels funny.</li>
    <li> I still don&#x27;t get how this works, and it&#x27;s crazy that it does.  I&#x27;m a 43-year old woman going through major hormone shifts and now suffering breakout spots that stay infected for more than a year sometimes.  I&#x27;ve been to several dermatologists, spent a lot of money on toxic perscriptions with no luck.  A 10-second pass over an emerging blemish with this gadget, and it&#x27;s gone.  But if the blemish is more acne-ish, (deep and cyst-like)  it might return in a few days--give 2 or 3 more 10-second zaps whenever it starts to surface, and eventually the affected follicle/gland/pore (whatever it is)  will disappear.  The zapping does dry the skin out, so I only use along the &amp;#34;t-zone&amp;#34; of my face and avoid cheekbones/cheeks, except for the blemish only.  My esthetician charges a lot for me to visit her for this treatment.  At about $40 bucks, having one of these at home is like making money.  Oh, the instructions are poorly translated--there is a really great youtube tutorial on how to use one of these--definitely look it up, it was easy to find through a web search.  It&#x27;s sad that I wasn&#x27;t told about this device years ago!</li>
    <li> Oh, it is cool! Just hold a lttile burn, but i always like it, because it means that something is going on</li>
    <li> The bulbs did not fit in device. I had to return it. I was really looking forward to it too. It looked similar to the ones we use at my work. I was sad to see they didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this long enough to see huge results, but my skin does appear tighter and more radiant.  Like some of the previous reviews state, the instructions are vague and confusing.  I got more information from the reviews than I did from the instruction manual.  It seems weird to put lightning up to your face, but it&#x27;s absolutely painless and not scary at all.  I hope it continues to work, and work well.</li>
    <li> This unit works perfectly and my wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;she uses it to take the swelling out of her arm that they took the limpth nodes out of&lt;br /&gt;for her cancer.  It tends to take thee swelling away.</li>
    <li> im very exating with my High frequency, the product its the exactly saler show. thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this particular HF device. The user manual is not clear at all. This product was out of the box for 10 minutes and stopped working. I love HF facials and will look for another HF product. Please consider buying a different HF product and avoid the hassle of returning.</li>
    <li> Being almost 40, the crow&#x27;s feet have emerged, the 11&#x27;s are apparent and the lines on my forehead tell the world I&#x27;m no longer in my 20&#x27;s. The reviews were impressive, but the results were not. Full aware any affect would be temporary and as the instructions clearly state \\&quot;full affect of product achieved in two weeks\\&quot;, my expectations were low. I used it for three treatments, full power with the mushroom, medium strength with the spoon and 1/4 with the small tool. Treatments totaled about 45 minutes, with different lotions. As many said, results may very, however my results were non-existent. The affect was the same as massaging your face by hand for five minutes. I rated it a two because the product was as described, instructions were thorough and was sturdily constructed.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the quality so was very pleased.  I use it every day and have noticed the fine lines disappearing.  I also had issues with hair loss and since I&#x27;&#x27;ve been using this the hair loss has stopped. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> I purchased this over a month ago and use it each day, I expected that it would make changes to rid dark pigmentation, and wrinkles. But I see no change at all. The product is good, but the directions were of no help, there were none! I went to youtube and also did a search to find some instructions for using the equipment the proper way. There was one video and it was of poor quality. It does have a smell when you use it. But they say it is normal. Im glad that I didn&#x27;t purchase the more expensive equipment.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love it</li>
    <li> The best advice I received for how to use this product was the suggestion that I check the derma wand site.  I found two and a half pages of detailed instructions at [...]</li>
    <li> Package arrived perfectly...nothing broken and in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;Well I started my treatment right a way.  I first started on the lower frequency and really didn&#x27;t feel much.  Next treatment went up on the frequency (there are only three settings).  After my fourth treatment I was using the highest frequency.  I do have a note for everyone with dental work (ie....metal caps) DO NOT use the high setting close to where you have your caps. You will get pain!!&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, after about 24 treatments there has not been any remarkable change at all.  Nothing, zip, nada! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this product, it&#x27;s not worth spending money on.&lt;br /&gt;I would probably purchase the higher priced with the higher setting product.  &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have never used this before but I noticed a difference first day! Love it this product and inexpensive too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this thing three times and the metal part on one of the wands broke off and got stuck into the wand itself. I got the metal part out and sent an email to this company and have waited for a response. No one has gotten back to me. I can&#x27;t say if it actually works or not as I haven&#x27;t had it that long.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update when I&#x27;ve had it a little longer and I can get a replacement. If not, don&#x27;t waste ur money with this particular seller.</li>
    <li> I used it on only one side of my face for a few weeks and saw absolutely no changes, not even in zits or blackheads. I was really excited about it too and it was a fun regimen that quickly fizzled. I feel as though my skin looks worse now. I am broken out and while using I was having issues with dry mouth and headaches. I even looked all over on how to properly use the thing. It is neat and all but I want something safer that has less side effects and that I can actually feel working.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t plug this in. Must be a European plug. Useless to me. Would love to have tried it. Returning ASAP.</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased this. It was delivered a little over a week ago. Out of the box the comb attachment broke. The metal base came off. Seems there was not enough glue holding it together however I decided to use the unit without the comb attachment. I started using it daily and even on the first day I was able to see results. I was excited by what I was seeing because I didn&#x27;t expect it to be as great as it was. Most of these type things are overrated but not this one. It seemed to do everything it claimed. After a little over a week of use the mushroom tool stopped working. I plugged it into the base like normal and nothing. It was dead! I thought maybe it needs to be cleaned. Turned off the unit, took it out and cleaned it up, plugged it back in, turned it on and nothing. It doesn&#x27;t work. So okay thought I would be able to use the spoon attachment and still get the same great results. Plugged in the spoon attachment and started using it and yeah it worked so I was a happy camper...at least for a day. The next day the spoon attachment while it lit up it didn&#x27;t seem to have the intensity in it anymore even when unit was turned up as high as it could go. So now the comb is broke, the mushroom tool is dead, and the spoon tool lost it&#x27;s intensity. There is only one tool left that works at this point. Very disappointed! I really loved this and for the money it was a gem find however after a week it&#x27;s now a lemon. Nice product but it needs some work on the quality side of it to make it a better product.</li>
    <li> The day I ordered this I was at my usual nail appointment and the spa owner proudly showed me her new RF facial machine!! Same EXACT attachments! I have only used it twice so far. I&#x27;m experimenting with the settings and attachments. The instructions are lame so do your research online. I will say that I used it on my two teenage sons for acne outbreaks and BAM, gone the next day. How cool is that for $40?</li>
    <li> IT LOOSES ITS POWER 30 SECONDS AFTERYOU TURN IT ON...I WOUDNT RECOMEND  TO ANYONE.. i THINK &amp;#34;DERMAWAND&amp;#34; IS A BETTER PRODUCT...</li>
    <li> This high frequency machine works greatly.  It has an adjustment switch that alows you to increase its power.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Dosent seem to work.  Instructions werent good. Have used it for several weeks with no change.  Dont waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love this machine for the price. It feels really relaxing to use this on my face morning and night. Often my skin feels tighter afterward. Unfortunately I let it roll of my toilet and one of my attachments broke, so it&#x27;s worth keeping an eye on. It zaps your skin lightly, in a non painful way. It creates this smell that reminds me of how clean people smell after being in ski suits outside for a couple of hours. I wouldn&#x27;t say the smell is nice, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it is bad either . . . just wierd.</li>
    <li> There was no information included on how to use the product. So had to guess what to do as far as usage was concerned. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I love to experiment with stuff so the fact that the directions are written by someone with only the most minimal knowledge of the English language has been an exciting challenge.&lt;br /&gt;But honestly guys, get some real directions. The current ones are charmingly meaningless.&lt;br /&gt;The machine, however, is elegant. Follow what instructions you can understand and be cautious. I can already see the difference in the wrinkles on my face after two sessions with the thing.&lt;br /&gt;I would also like some more scientific information on what&#x27;s happening.</li>
    <li> Well I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m twenty again but I think it&#x27;s working pretty well. I did remove a brown spot on my arm with it and was pretty amazed at how it worked.</li>
    <li> Very weak, didn&#x27;t last too long before it died either.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my 14 year old daughter to help with her break outs. I&#x27;m an esthetician and I use the big more exspensive hyfrequency machines at work. This one works just as well, at an Awesome price! Seller shipped really fast.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly, as described, well packaged, easy to use, came with instructions that are easy to read and understand, and nothing was broken. Works well, also. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is very useful stuff. My wife was very glad about this device and features. Thanks a lot for in-time delivery:)</li>
    <li> I just received this product and have not used it yet; however, the English on the box and instructions is very poor and not clear, for example: &amp;#34;do not expose intensely under the sun in the month&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;only for recommended duration to aviburns on the dermis&amp;#34;.  Of course, those can be figured out, but really should be correct if they want to sell this product in America....  I will revisit this after I have used it.</li>
    <li> This is a great device that the whole family gets to enjoy.  I use it for my scalp treatments.  My wife, daughter and son uses this device for their facials and it does wonders.  This is a must for the family.  Thank you for the wonderful deal.</li>
    <li> Returned it, changed contours of face around mouth area. Stopped using it immediately, took several weeks to get back to normal.</li>
    <li> Broken - didn&#x27;t work well. I had to return this item.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle product that I am so loving!  I am seeing results while using this on my face for 3mins at a time twice daily.  Its plumping how my deep laugh lines and completely removing my dark circles.</li>
    <li> I have always prided myself for looking younger than I am but in the last several months everything has sagged, a little more everyday. I have been using for over a week, only skipping two days and one day doing it twice. I did not take a before picture and initially was pretty disappointed. However, I remember seeing an infomercial for a different brand and the reason I got this was because I was impressed by the demo of raising the eyebrows. She pulled the lid up with the attachment and held it for several seconds. She did this action in several spots below the eyebrow. Well I did that to only one side and guess what? I could not deny the results. So I am now using this lift and hold on all the areas I want lifted. I took a selfie yesterday so I will have something to compare it to.&lt;br /&gt;I have since \\&quot;lifted\\&quot; the other eyebrow and it is now even with the first one I did.&lt;br /&gt;I believe many people who have given bad reviews did not use the right action or give it enough time. I think they were doubting Thomases in the first place, as was I. Due to the skepticism they were extremely disappointed. I am glad I kept it and will post updates.&lt;br /&gt;2-27-2014 Update. I have had the D&#x27;arsonval for 3 weeks. I use it everyday. I have only missed two days so I used it twice the next day. At first I just wasn&#x27;t sure, but instead of being upset, I began to think about the process and how it works. I mentioned earlier the reason I bought it, the eyebrow demonstration. I realized that the skin is tightened and lifted when the D&#x27;arsonval is applied to it. My eyebrows, I did one a day in order to prove to myself that it really works, definitely showed that they were higher and in turn the area of my eyelid was no longer folding over itself. I also realized that the reason there was an almost instant result (it really took about 5 hrs after I used it to see the results)with my eyelids was because there was essentially no weight to the skin in that area and the skin was easy and quick to lift. I also realized that my cheeks, jowls if you will, were much much heavier and it would take a longer time to see results. I have slowed the motions, going much more slowly and deliberately, lifting and holding the skin as I went. I am definitely seeing an improvement, I do look much better and my \\&quot;waddle\\&quot; is much less loose and does not move much at all now. I really only use two of the attachments, the one that is about the size of a quarter (looks like a metal detector) and the other one that has a ball at the end of it. The quarter size one I can use at the highest level. The ball one is much more concentrated and I can only tolerate it at about half the output.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had taken a picture but....oh well. You will just have to believe me. It does work. Just takes awhile with slow focused effort on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;I also know that I have absolutely slowed or stopped the droop. $30 very well spent.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for one week and I have seen good results.  Not only is it great for fine lines/wrinkles, but I have rosacea and the redness is fading very nicely.  I use it twice per day (before applying makeup in the am and after cleansing at night) about 3 - 4 minutes each time.  Love this!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I believe that people who say it doesn&#x27;t work are expecting miracles overnight. I used this twice daily for a few weeks and noticed a slight difference. After a month or so, I noticed dramatic results. You won&#x27;t get your 20 year old face back but it does lift slightly and take away that &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; look for sure. I found a you tube video with instructions from a home user. She said to move it slowly from the centre of your face to your hairline - basically in the direction of a face &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34;. On problem spots like under the jaw line, hold the wand there for a count of 10. You might feel some tingling which is good. I started off with the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; dial at about 4 or 5 o&#x27;clock and then moved up gradually to almost full &amp;#34;volume&amp;#34;. The first time you feel a snap, you might jump but it&#x27;s not harmful or painful, it&#x27;s just something you&#x27;re not used to :). If you don&#x27;t like the snap feel, then just dial it down. The video I watched had the woman use it with aloe vera gel. I found this dried too quickly. I LOVE using it with coconut oil. Yes, the same oil you use to saute your veggies in a healthy way is a fantastic, organic skin softener which won&#x27;t cause blemishes.  Now, having said all of that, I bought my wand in November (it&#x27;s now mid Feb) and it just stopped working mid use a few days ago. I checked out the seller info and they guarantee that it will work for one year so for the price, even if that&#x27;s all the use I get out of it, totally worth it!! Just use it regularly, I used it about 10 minutes each time (it feels really great!), and be patient, hold the wand in problem spots for a count of 10 with each use as well as go over it slowly, and you will see a difference. Enjoy!! :)</li>
    <li> My high frequency wand, near the handle, has smudging and dirty-looking adhesive sticky stuff on it. It works, and the dirty part can be cleaned, so I&#x27;m too lazy to return it. I do question why there would be dirt on a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; product and as the box it came in is not sealed with plastic, I don&#x27;t have confidence that this is a manufacturing issue and not a seller issue. Would not purchase from this seller again. I welcome their reply if they wish to address this.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Product came fast. Great condition. I have used a few times and already notice my bags under my eyes have gone down. I started getting acne again that I had not had since I was a teenager and this has helped with the blackheads especially.</li>
    <li> If its working or if its not working. The day you do it your skin looks nice plump glowing but the next day it all goes away. I think its only temporary fix. The smell is something you need to get used to but you can tolerate it.&lt;br /&gt;I am using this for a month now I also have started using the Tria age defying laser so I dont know which of them is doing the work but my skin looks a little better each day, but like I said the results are only temporary. Its to cheap to send it back. I will just keep and use it here and there..</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product at a much lower price than I would have expected.  I have used it less than 2 wk and my skin is much tighter and the lines are less noticeable.  I am 66 and had plenty and I noticed a difference from the first treatment.  I would have given 5 stars but the instructions are virtually useless.  Fortunately there are plenty on the web, including videos so it doesn&#x27;t present a huge problem but the sellers should make sure there are decipherable instructions.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these: the initial one I purchased I gave to my daughter who is absolutely thrilled with the results. She uses it twice a day, religiously. I haven&#x27;t seen her results yet. I, on the other hand, have been hit-or-miss, and so don&#x27;t have as positive a response. I DO love the comb attachment for scalp stimulation.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not very powerful, but it gets the job done. I may return it for a better model. Also, the box I got was damaged. I don&#x27;t know if that happened in shipping. They didn&#x27;t pad the inside of the box at all. I assume this is because it has it&#x27;s own padding inside of it&#x27;s case, but that caused the box to get damaged and a corner to come loose. Now it wont stay together.</li>
    <li> I used one of these when I was in cosomotology school years ago. This works beautifully, not only will it work on wrinkles but it will stimulate hair growth if you hair is thinning due to temporary loss.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the professional one on my galvanic machine but is portable. Great price too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using the tear drop wand most of the time with Olay serum and it really tightens up my skin and pores.  It&#x27;s a bit scary to insert and remove the glass tubes.  Videos suggest using a towel in case they break.  So far min have been OK and have stayed in tact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you have to take great care in storing them so they don&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend remarked that I looked &amp;#34;refreshed&amp;#34; when I started using it.</li>
    <li> Many promises, many claims, but so far neither dramatic nor, as far as I can tell, subtle results. Needs more time? Perhaps, and perhaps a more clear manual with much better instructions is needed. I haven&#x27;t given up since all the furious electrical zapping seems to suggest it&#x27;s doing something. I hope not for the worst! I will say on behalf of the device (tentatively) that the claims some have made of instant results don&#x27;t make sense since the stimulation of elastin and collagen growth would surely be time-spanning. For example, I don&#x27;t trust the exuberant claims made in TV commercials for the similar DermaWand. Short-term results, if any, must just be muscle or skin contractions from the high-frequency onslaught. Long lasting results would surely take time. And so my review must for now be neutral. Have only used it for a month, twice daily, as of this review.</li>
    <li> Not sure about this item, used it for spot removal on my legs and it did not appear to work, will try it again and make sure I am using it correctly.  Also the directions to the device and the writing on the box for the device had improper english on it.  It also refered to cleaning the instruments in 75% rubbing alc.  However that % is not sold....</li>
    <li> I like it very much but can&#x27;t find replacement parts for a broken tube.</li>
    <li> I love this ......Use it once daily in the evening......between this and the derma wand I have been extremely satisified</li>
    <li> I am into my third week of using this tool twice each day for around 10 min.a session. I am just starting to see some very slight changes in the tone of my skin. It does seem a wee bit tighter and uplifted.Because I do see a very little change, I&#x27;ll continue to use it for maybe 6 months and give myself another review then. Maybe by then, there will be a huge change! I love all of the energy frequency and light ray products, so I do want to give this a real chance at helping my skin repair and look better!</li>
    <li> Ho my God i really love that machine !!!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every day for 4 months now and don&#x27;t see a difference in my skin tone, dark spots or any skin tightening around my eyes or neck.  it feels like it&#x27;s doing something amazing while its going across my skin and it slightly tingles but it&#x27;s not changing anything it just feels like it.</li>
    <li> No instructions came with.</li>
    <li> The product is definitely used. The comb had a broken tooth and the other glass tools weren&#x27;t in order. The wires seemed to have color stains which wouldn&#x27;t exist if it were factory new. Clearly showed that someone used it, put it back. Not happy with this product at all.</li>
    <li> love it love it I can see the diference in my face</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this device for a week now. I read all the reviews before I purchased, so I knew that the instructions that come with it were useless. And they really are. I started off with the mushroom attachment. I use it on my face &amp; neck twice a day after I apply moisturizer. I am 45 years old and recently lost 50 pounds. I don&#x27;t have the saggy skin that most people have who lose weight quickly. But, I did notice that my skin on my neck is a little creepy. That is no longer the case. It worked so well on my neck, I started using it on my hands. I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple of days, but the change is very noticeable. No matter how much lotion I use, my hands always look dry. Now they are looking good. I use it on the lowest setting on my face, medium setting on my neck and hands. I love it. Worth the 25 dollars.</li>
    <li> I bought this device last summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I received it and looked at the instructions, I was somewhat concerned about the quality of this device because the instructions are horrible! I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use it and at the time, I couldn&#x27;t find any good instructions online. So what I did was just move it in upward strokes over my face and held it in place over areas of bigger concern for several minutes. I did this morning and night for about 2 weeks. Doing just those things definitely helped. My husband noticed a difference after a couple of weeks. I know he would tell me the truth because he&#x27;s told me when things didn&#x27;t help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How It Has Helped Me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a month, I began to use it less and less frequently until I just didn&#x27;t use it anymore. I went for several months without using it at all before I began to see an increase in wrinkles again. So I began using it again. I saw improvement more quickly this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have quit using it and restarted using it several times over the last year and each time I have noticed a quicker improvement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has helped with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Vertical lines above my lips from years of smoking.( Quitting smoking helped a lot, but not enough)&lt;br /&gt;- Puffy eyes&lt;br /&gt;- The &#x27;elevens&#x27; between my eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;- Crows feet&lt;br /&gt;- A general lift in the eye area&lt;br /&gt;-Tightening of the skin under my jaw line. ( That has never returned even when I quit using this device)&lt;br /&gt;- An all over healthy glow to my skin&lt;br /&gt;*** The ONLY thing I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in is pore size, BUT I haven&#x27;t used this consistently over the last year. Therefor, I can&#x27;t say for certain that it wouldn&#x27;t. I also have never gotten rid of all wrinkles, but again, I haven&#x27;t been consistent with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Information About Me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are things I would like to know about people reviewing beauty products.  I&#x27;m listing  factors that may or may not have an effect on my success with this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I am *yikes*, 44 years old&lt;br /&gt;- I am very fair skinned&lt;br /&gt;- I have spent YEARS in the sun without any sunscreen working outside as a landscape designer and avid gardener.&lt;br /&gt;- I began using sunscreen religiously  at the age 41&lt;br /&gt;- I did a lot of damage to my skin by smoking for nearly 30 years, especially vertical lines above my lips&lt;br /&gt;- I never did much to take care of my skin until I was 39 years old&lt;br /&gt;- At 41, I began making my own skin care products from organic sources which helped A LOT before beginning to use this device&lt;br /&gt;- I have done glycolic acid peels at home. Many before using this device&lt;br /&gt;- I have been blessed with good genes, (This may have something to do with why I have had such good results?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About This Device:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had any problems with this device. The only one thing that has happened is that a screw came loose. This caused the wands to wobble. I tightened it up (with the device unplugged!) I have had no problems since then. ( see picture)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since learned that the frequency rating of this device is much lower than what is generally recommended. Even so, I have had wonderful results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am considering purchasing a new HF device with a higher Hz rating. When I do, I will purchase one by D&#x27;arsonval because it is obviously a well made product.</li>
    <li> Mine has worked flawlessly and I use it a couple times per week. I feel it works great for zit flareups, but I really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference on lines/wrinkles. Easy to use though and worth the money</li>
    <li> Referred by the woman who does my facials. Great product!  Works well. Clears up any pimples super quick. I don&#x27;t have acne issues but can get s few breakouts from time to time. They are gone the next day. Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin red or irritated. I do notice a mild headache afterwards, but that&#x27;s all I can complain about. I have and will continue to recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> This device initially worked. But to use it you will be more detached piece of glass. And it hurts others and itchy skin. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I received this item quickly, and it was exactly as described. It was ordered as a gift for my wife, and she loves it.</li>
    <li> This product works as long as you use it. I love it. I saw results right away. I bought a product like this for over $100. doesnot work as good as this.</li>
    <li> The item was clearly used, it had stains all over. Also, the instructions are written in a very poor English and are hard to understand. The price is really good but at the expense of quality, so it&#x27;s up to the buyer to choose.</li>
    <li> This product has changed my life.  If you use it daily (as recommended) it will do exactly what it promises.  I have had oily acne prone facial skin my whole life and as I have gotten older my face has begun to sag and give the appearance of being tired making looking much older than I am.  This product has made my skin and large pores become tighter leaving my skin smooth an youthful looking also my acne breakouts and scarring has all but disappeared. its like Botox in a box.  I have also found that when i get joint pain from arthritis inflammation that rubbing the wand over my hands and fingers REALLY helps the dimish the pain.  I bought one for my sister and she loves it also.  i have used this on the my 91 year old mothers RA ridden hands and she LOVES IT. She said it helps so much that she sleeps well at night now with out smelly rubs/creams and pills for the pain.  I have done some research on the effects of High Freq Argon  use and if done properly and consistantly it will help with so many of our body issues not just the external skin.  I will NEVER be without one again.  Wonderful products for the price.  No need for $300.+ ones. This one does exactly what they do at an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;Im hooked and sold on HIGH FREQ USE</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by my cosmetologist. I bought it for myself. It helps me to fight with acne that I have since I was 15 (now 26). It also improves my skin tone and makes it smoothier. I also like the smell that comes out of my skin during use.&lt;br /&gt;Now bought 2 more. One for my mom and one for friend who has same skin problems to mine.</li>
    <li> Great all around!  Product is durable and shipping/receiving was drama free, thanks!  Will be back with progress update.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Made my skin lovely!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay...  Not sure why the package was bent and not sealed tight.</li>
    <li> I have a derma wand device and bought this because of the different attachments. The only one I use so far is the one referred to as the mushroom attachment. I like this better than the derma wand because the glass attachment I&#x27;m using covers a larger area (takes less time).  Caution....be careful with the glass attachments...pulling them in and out. The comb attachment broke in my hand the first time I was trying to use it. I put too much pressure on the teeth of the comb when I was trying to shove it in.  I wasn&#x27;t too upset it broke, because I didn&#x27;t buy it for this purpose (to stimulate my scalp). But it would have been nice to see if it actually works to thicken hair...now I&#x27;ll never know. So far I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. It came in a nice professional looking box.....the price is unbeatable!    Update: October 8, 2014     So, I&#x27;ve been using this product now for over a month. Highest level, 3 - 5 minutes in the morning and 3- 5 minutes in the evening.  Strange....but I think I&#x27;ve had better results with the dermawand and might go back to using that.   When I&#x27;m using the dermawand, I notice a significant difference in my skin...firmer and more clarity etc.  I originally gave this product four stars...because I thought it would be the same as the dermawand with more attachments but a way better price.    I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement what-so-ever....strange because I thought it should work the same???</li>
    <li> I have been using this product everyday for 3-5 min for the past two months.  I have noticed that my skin is smoother and appears to be tighter overall. Also, decreased puffiness around my eyes.  No acne outbreaks since using this product.  I also use it on my scalp for seborrheic dermatitis and to my surprise, it greatly improves this condition also.  Great product for me.  i am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> So far so good. However as I was using the product the lights started dimming when I would turn it off, the lights went back to normal. Makes a  pretty signifigant difference in my skin tone, for the better.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. But not for amatures. It is supposed to zap skin tags, age spots, etc. You have to be careful though, to turn it on when it&#x27;s on your skin and off without taking it away from your skin. I think the more I use it, the better I like it!</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find this HF device and am still experimenting with it. The directions for use are not very helpful. I found a couple of videos on Utube that demonstrated the uses.</li>
    <li> It is really functional, It creates Ozone(O3) when it touches on your skin. I refreshes your face and lessens the acne. Good product...</li>
    <li> Exact same thing they sell in novelty stores for $150.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I think it could be a great product but my&lt;br /&gt;Plug says 250v. I was told it can be used in US but I don&#x27;t know for sure.  I was told I have the right plug. The directions are vague as to what I have .  The pamphlet says 110 ac then 220 240 250 v anyone have any ideas ??</li>
    <li> Instruction translations rather garbled</li>
    <li> Love this product. I am 53 years old and had some facial sagging.. Within two weeks I have seen improvement. I use it nightly while watching t.v. so it doesn&#x27;t even interrupt my routine.</li>
    <li> This was so much cheaper than other devises.............and it works! I have been using it for 2 weeks almost everyday and can see a big difference. Skin is tighter too. Use a clear toning gel ( Serious Skincare Facial Toning Conductive Gel) is what i use, don&#x27;t know if they sell it on here. Bought mine on HSN. Takes 5 to 10 min of your time a day.....well worth it!</li>
    <li> I used the High Frequency machine on the highest setting with the mushroom wand for 5 minutes on each limb, 5 days in a row. After using the mushroom I used the zapper attachment to target sun spots.&lt;br /&gt;On the fifth day as I was using the zapper on one of my sun spots on the back of my hand, I felt a weird sensation on a nerve or vein. The next day I noticed that I had a small bump and a swollen vein in that spot. Then I noticed that I had developed varicose veins, mostly, on my hands and feet.&lt;br /&gt;I, now, have slight pain and discomfort. I also feel occasional tingling in one of my elbows and one of my knees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found nothing on the internet about there being a correlation. I hope it&#x27;s just a coincidence that I got a sudden onset of varicose veins the same week that I began to use the High Frequency machine.&lt;br /&gt;I wish someone knowledgable would tell me if it&#x27;s even possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been applying Horse Chestnut cream for 3 days and I&#x27;m hoping it will, soon, help.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come with very good instructions.  It seemed to me that they must have thought you knew how to use it.  The instructions&lt;br /&gt;looked like it was from a foreign nation and they didn&#x27;t know how to write directions in English.  They were so vague that I still don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;know how to use it.</li>
    <li> I wish I had the box.  I would return it!  Spend the money and buy a better model.  The glass pieces fall out when you try to use it.  It is a joke.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this purchase overall. The product works as described. The most impressive part of my whole transaction was the exceptional customer service I received. I cannot say enough nice things about this seller. One of the heads that came with the unit did not work. I didn&#x27;t really care since there were several others to choose from. When the seller contacted me to inquire about my purchase I briefly mentioned one of the heads did not work. I was very surprised to be informed that they had contacted the manufacturer and a new one was sent right out to me. Very unexpected but greatly appreciated. I would absolutely buy from again in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this machine.  It works great and has more attachments and uses than the Dermawand and it&#x27;s CHEAPER TOO!</li>
    <li> I had my doubts, but this unit really does work. tried it for skin lines and wrinkles, hair growth and I see difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this D&#x27;arsonval High frequency direct for Home use device for several months now and it&#x27;s very strong, just like a professional one, it&#x27;s good for reducing inflammation caused by acne and skin tightening. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The instructions are kinda fun to read simply because they are translated enlglish but the product is perfect!</li>
    <li> I was seeing results and liked very much.  Have used occasionally because lasing effects. I was away most of year and returned to 2nd home where this is kept and the wand has broken off at base WHILE I was using it!  Base stuck inside electrical part. I had been using carefully and correctly. I will attempt to return Very disappointing</li>
    <li> I am disappointed because one of the wands came apart even though I have been especially careful in removing it from the machine.  And I haven&#x27;t figured out a way to contact the company that sells this.  I got through Amazon as an add on and they only allow for a return.  I don&#x27;t want to return the entire thing as I like the machine.  It is helping with my wrinkles and brightens my skin it&#x27;s not a huge difference each time but it is getting better.  Some of the deep wrinkles are less noticeable after using several times a week once a day.  Has also helped with my acne which I struggle with all the time. It does get rid of irritation and redness.  I use it before going to sleep and in the morning my face looks fresher.  I have used it on my hair and I think it has actually darkened my hair some plus I see new hair growth which is nice.  I have thyroid issues and my hair tends to get thin so new growth is wonderful. My hair feels soft, fuller and smells clean.  It doesn&#x27;t take very long to do both my face and hair.  It would be a 5 if the wand didn&#x27;t break.</li>
    <li> love it. gives a tightening glow.</li>
    <li> Great for acne clearing</li>
    <li> Just as described.  I cannot use as it makes my heart skip beats.</li>
    <li> I like it so far. I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of facial toning things lately. So if this winds up working well for me, I think it will be a combination of derma rolling, this and the diamond tip skin vacuum tips. I&#x27;m just trying to improve the appearance of my skin. I don&#x27;t really mind being 48 - I just don&#x27;t want people to guess that I&#x27;m 48. :)</li>
    <li> This is a really great device.  I will buy another one as a gift.  It delivers.  If there is one problem it is that the instruction manual does not state that the machine should be cool before plucking the glass instruments from the device.  The metal tips are metal so metal expands when hot and that makes it difficult to &amp;#34;pluck&amp;#34; from the device.  The metal tip came off of the &amp;#34;mushroom tube&amp;#34; and was stuck in the machine.  But never mind, I still love this device.</li>
    <li> the product box was different, seemed to be another brand that shown in the image</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first. This was a very budget friendly tool and what were the odds it would work. I have recently lost quite a bit of weight and my neck was looking quite rough.  So I thought what the heck.  This has become an invaluable tool for myself and my girls. It does temporarily tighten the skin in my decolletage and neck, which makes me feel so much more confident. It&#x27;s not a huge difference, like a facelift or anything that others would really notice, but I notice and it makes me feel better.  Then we use the tool for my teenage daughter&#x27;s blemishes. They come up and ask, mom will you zap me and we get it out and within two days, some really biggies, are all but gone.  They swear by it.  So all in all, great product, great price, and for me, better than expected.  I did google youtube videos to find out how to use this thing. I highly recommend you do that before jumping in.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks.  The first one I received had a broken prod thing but I called Amazon and they are always so on it. Sent another one right away.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine lines and seldom deal with a bit of acne. Blackheads was a bigger issue. Within a few days my blackheads were unnoticeable. My fine lines are a little less obvious. My makeup applies nicer. Skin feels better. My husband thought I was nuts until I zapped his zit two days in a row and it disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;A spa treatment would cost you at least double what this cost so I had nothing to lose. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I used it for a couple of days, but it has a wear smell that stays in my face, and the spoon glass broke the second day that I use it.</li>
    <li> Love this. I use it for myself and on clients in salon. I use it for treating dandruff and hair loss issues. I use it at home on my face during facials and on my sons  acne</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this device but it broke upon second use.  I read a lot of reviews and watched videos on Youtube before purchasing and I wanted so badly to have and use and keep this tool but alas the glass wands are delicate.  In my case, the mushroom wand separated from it&#x27;s metal base.  I was very careful in handling the wands and nontheless it broke.  I returned this item and won&#x27;t buy another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the instruction booklet is highly non-informational. It was likely written in a foreign language and translated using an automated translation program which rendered this booklet as crazy incomprehensible. Don&#x27;t rely on this instruction booklet for any help in knowing how to use the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go to youtube before you buy this and if you buy it watch the youtube videos before you use the device.</li>
    <li> this product arrived fairly fast. not quite sure if i am using it correctly. the instructions are not that clear. i havent noticed any change in my skin. i should of bought the dermawand instead.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this device for three months. After reading reviews of how fragile the electrodes were, I took extra care to use mine. Well last week the electrode base detached from the glass. Now I&#x27;m the task to find an electrode which reading some reviews it is impossible or order another device since they are so cheap.</li>
    <li> Instructions for us of this device are terrible; not written by someone with command of the language.  No information about how different attachments are to be used, no cautions.  I went online and viewed some home-spun videos which offered good advice about how to prep your skin, especially about protecting your eyes!  After a two weeks of use, no noticeable difference.  Probably a waste of money</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any difference other than my skin is more dry, so I know it&#x27;s exfoliating. I have only used this a couple times. I do like how it works though, as far as how it feels on my skin.It&#x27;s tingly! I just hope it&#x27;s not dangerous as far as cancer causing etc. Also, the smell worries me as I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s dangerous either. I close my eyes when I get near them just in case the thing might try to fry my eyeballs! :-)  Yeah, you can say I worry about these things, but who knows what&#x27;s safe and what isn&#x27;t anymore. I will give updates as time goes on and I use this more.</li>
    <li> Good treatment for the skin</li>
    <li> Love this product. Had a really bad break out due to a new foundation. Use this twice a day for a week and my skin looks amazing. I&#x27;m 27 and have had on going acne issues since I was in high school. This is the best my skin has looked in a long time. I am very happy I found this.</li>
    <li> Great while it works. But mine lasted for only 2 months &amp; it has lost its current/strength and is not working as well as when I first got it. This is my second set &amp; I still think it&#x27;s  worth the money.</li>
    <li> This piece of crap is definitely is no good this junk does not do anything for your skin or lessens blackheads.Whoever invented this should be tared and feathered. Waste of time and money sent this junk packing back to where it came from.</li>
    <li> IT HELPED ME CLEAR MY ACNE, I RECOMOEND IT JUST BECAREFUL USING IT IT CAN BE FRAGILE AND COULD  BREAK</li>
    <li> love it, every one needs on</li>
    <li> I have not notice any different yet</li>
    <li> I saw results after the first use. After two weeks it looked like I had a face lift. I am a real person not a paid reviewer. If I could I&#x27;d post pics. I took a pic when I got it and after two weeks. When I show friends they cannot believe the difference. I researched the difference between this product and Dermawand. Same frequency and basically same product. Don&#x27;t spend the money on Dermawand. This had spectacular results. I can&#x27;t guarantee that everyone will have the results that I did but mine were miraculous. Really wish that I could attach my pics.</li>
    <li> Though this product is not UL listed and makes some claims that are a bit odd.  I primarily purchased it as a facial wand to heal/prevent blemishes and it works well for this task.  The &#x27;crackling&#x27;noise and seeing it is not UL listed makes me a bit nervous.  But I&#x27;m very careful when using it.</li>
    <li> Outside of box does not indicate skin tightening, only spot removal. The manual included does mention skin tightening, however, the manual reads like it is written in broken English and is difficult to understand. It does not give clear instruction for use, especially since it is supposed to have several uses. it does not indicate which instrument to use for a particular function, or on what intensity, nor for how long. I have been using it twice a day for a month and have not seen any results. Actually, I&#x27;m concerned that the skin under my eyes looks worse.</li>
    <li> This item worked well the first two times it was used.  After that it never seemed to reach full power before it finally stopped working all together.  Also, the instructions were very poorly translated to English making some of them nonsensical.</li>
    <li> Did not like, sent it back.</li>
    <li> This product works very well. I can see the results after each use. The hard part is establishing the habit of using it regularly.</li>
    <li> Love this High Frequency glass wand.  Took my daughter for a facial and they used one on her.  It has prevented many pimples from forming.</li>
    <li> I am not sure why this product has so many good reviews.&lt;br /&gt; I have been using it every day for 2 weeks and still havent seen any result. I havent seen any face lifting, wrinkle change or any of the promised changes.&lt;br /&gt;The manual was poorly developed and the instructions are very strict.&lt;br /&gt;It looks like a copy of some other product out there&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a awesome product. I have a problem with muscle spasms and was told that this might help. While it doesn&#x27;t get rid of them completely it does help tremendously. I would recommend any on to try this if they are have muscle issues.</li>
    <li> I recommend, this product is very good to heal the skin.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 of these, 1 quit working after 1 month. Now they say we can&#x27;t return it. !!!!!</li>
    <li> I believe this product is good.  No information on how to use each parts is given.  Tried them all and used them every where on my face.  The hair part is obvious enough, its shape is a comb.&lt;br /&gt;A bit dissappointed of the lack of info.  In a nut shell this product works if used consistently and the price is right.</li>
    <li> So I am pushing 60 and am realistic about results. I have good skin and want to keep, improve and maintain what I have. Lately (last year) I decided to put more effort into my skin so I began using CoQ10 cream, hyalouronic acid cream and wild yam creams with some improvement to skin softness but improvement to wrinkles and skin tone on my face and neck was minimal and I wanted to get rid of my &#x27;jowls&#x27; and the turkey neck thing that has been getting worse. I bought a microdermabrasion device (SkinvacMD) after much research to get rid of the old skin surface so the creams would be able to work on the newer skin. This was quite effective and I saw some more improvement but still felt my skin was saggy - so I checked out dermawand via Amazon and was led to the D&#x27;arsonval....  so dermawand $200 vs d&#x27;arsonval $32.... I read the reviews and thought i&#x27;d spend the $30 to see if I am on the right track - well, I love this device!  I wash first, place the 3 creams I mentioned before, and make sure I don&#x27;t forget my chest too.  This has 3 wands, I watched the youtube and dermawand videos before I used it because for sure the instructions are a big joke.  Also, the 3 wands are easy to slide into the hand unit with a firm but gentle push-twist and I use a dry cloth to hold them while placing into the unit. The odor from the wand touching the skin is like the air after a spring rain with lightening. Most invigorating since I love springtime!  I have only been using this twice a day for 2 weeks and I have seen much improvement on my neck tone, jowls are less and my face has more tone. Also noticed today that my forehead skin appears to be gaining collagen and seems not as thin or boney when I use the wand. I had deep frown lines on forehead and between eyebrows and on my neck but they seem less too. I have waited to write a review so as not to mislead about improvement but I am so excited that I am able to improve my skin without any big expenses. If this is only after 2 weeks of use then my money and time are well spent!  I am still using the microdermabraision once a week to maintain the skin surface. I have had several people remark on what pretty skin I have (and the glow is great) and I don&#x27;t wear makeup to work so this is pretty good for my age group! It may not work for you but its cheap enough to try it out! Hope this helps and good luck!se then my money and time are well spent!

    <li> Arrived in box as pictured, perfect condition, plug usual. Works fine, felt timid about installing electrodes, they are glass, so I used the screw in method, though they do not actually screw in, no threads, but it was my way of being slow, and careful. I have used three times, and I like it.  Hope it will make some of my sags and wrinkles disappear. Found the following warning on ask.com  Never create a gap of more than one fourth of an inch between the electrode and the skin, as this can cause tissue damage that will heal leaving behind brownish marks on the skin.    Read more: [...]  So not sure about that and do not intend to test it.</li>
    <li> It would be funny if it was not dangerously to sale a product without a professional manual something that a person would use for her body, uses electricity and releases ozone.</li>
    <li> I really did not see much difference on the tightening part but I did seem to work on my acne...not completely clear but i did notice that my pimples would dry up faster.  The bad thing is that  it comes with no instructions on how to use it. I actually felt tighter skin with the Hyaluronic acid i used after that with this device.</li>
    <li> Only one of the glass electrodes can be felt. The rake, the mushroom top etc have absolutely no power. Would not recommend to those who have experience with high frequency in salons and spas.</li>
    <li> This is a great spa style product for home use.  I became friends with a girl who has amazing skin.  GLOWING SKIN.... So I had to ask her what she uses (or if she goes to the spa a lot) and she told me about this little miracle worker. When it arrived, I laughed a bit because it slightly resembles a vibrator. (Obviously--- not for that use-ouch! Lol)  The instructions don&#x27;t really make any sense, so I suggest watching some YouTube videos. I put rosehip oil on my face and then zap away.  I didn&#x27;t really have problems with my skin until my late twenties and it became worse from using harsh products and from me picking at my pimples.  This machine will oxegenate your pores and within a day or two, the pimple will vanish.  I also noticed that my skin is becoming even toned and the scars from where I popped pimples in the past are disappearing. I highly recommend this machine.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT ITEM , THANKS</li>
    <li> The directions for this item are hard to understand.They were written by someone who doesn&#x27;t use English as their first language.Also,I really haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in my skin tone,but will keep using it anyway!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that this product would work, but being someone who has to try everything&#x27; I went ahead and bought it.  I have had this type of treatment in a spa and was happy with the results.  I found this machine to be wonderful.  It immediately tightened my neck area and also worked well on my face.  I am 69 years old and have tried many beauty treatments, and I must say this is well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> so i must rewrite it took a while to reach must be because of holiday anyway i love it and worth the wait</li>
    <li> The team is small, but very useful. and seemed to have good prices. But it received in poor condition as some of the pieces I get heading.</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected and instructions are easy to follow. I noticed that as spot treating a blemish i noticed less redness swelling the following day after use. For fine lines I havent had it long enough to notice if it will work.</li>
    <li> This product seems to work pretty well ~ it&#x27;s just taking the time to use it on a regular basis that is most difficult.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for one week, but I&#x27;m already noticing a difference. I am excited to see what the next week will bring. The instructions are completely useless, but I watched a few videos online and I&#x27;m good to go. It came packaged well and I have no trouble getting the different pieces in and out. They are all glass so don&#x27;t be a moron, and be careful when inserting and removing.</li>
    <li> Not really sure it does anything....</li>
    <li> On the very first use, my under eye puffiness and wrinkles were reduced by at least 80% and it stays good for several days.  I tried using the mushroom head and it&#x27;s too mild. The small tip is too intense. The best one for me is the tongue shaped electrode.My entire face looks more refreshed after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had as much luck with using it on pimples, but I&#x27;ve read that the correct electrodes are filled with argon, which lights up purple instead of orange like these ones do. I&#x27;m going to buy the kit with argon electrodes next.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product. I can tell my skin is improving. Seems tighter on my jawline. I would recommend this product if you are looking for a high frequency machine.</li>
    <li> I like clear instructions.  Not only was the instruction pamphlet unclear, the typos made the reading more difficult.  No means to identify the strength of the electricity.  There was no problem in determining how to use the high frequency home unit, but I didn&#x27;t feel that I would get the best use from it without more solid instructions.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work as expected. If it weren&#x27;t for the noise you would not be able to tell there was any current at all. The instructions were not complete and what instructions there were , were not very clear.</li>
    <li> I love this little machine. didn&#x27;t like the instructions, or the plug, but the plug does work, and just read what everyone has to say about how they use the wand. Now the salons that use  high frequency, you see results within 160 days because the skin is growing. So don&#x27;t think you are going to see results right away.My skin has never felt so good. and the hair that I have trouble with on my chin, is starting to go away, For that along I love it... My neck has tightened up a lot. And for the price... where can you go wrong, I&#x27;ll keep updating to let you know how it is going.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; product for any esthetian.Very portable if needed. Very affordable. This will give you a good idea to see if this is a service that your demographic will be interested in utilizing before purchasing a top quality multi-use equipment.</li>
    <li> Product delivery was fast.  As others have stated, instructions are not very clear.  It would have been great if a video was included, but for the price I won&#x27;t complain.  I had to do some surfing on the Internet for any additional information I could find on the use of the product. I think it was created more for professional use than home use, considering the lack of information provided.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the product once so far.  It stings at first, but once it touches and stays on the skin it&#x27;s tolerable.  I noticed a strange odor while using it, as with the use of a similar product.  Perhaps it&#x27;s the gas inside of the tube.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy that I have the product and will be learning how to use it correctly, so until then, I won&#x27;t be able to give a complete rate.  I gave it a 3 because of the lack of information included, but I&#x27;m hoping it will turn out to be a 5.</li>
    <li> Would like to have seen a few more details as to where to place each tool on you face. Appears to be a good product so far.Hasn&#x27;t totally done exactly what I wanted but I think I may actually need help from an Opthomolgist to assist in my puffiness, but it has actually made a little difference in the decrease of puffiness and wrinkles around my mouth lines. I whould certainly reccommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> First, let me just say that I do not own this product.  A friend of mine bought it, and loves it, so I thought I&#x27;d check it out on Amazon.  There seems to be a lot of confusion in here, so I thought I would make a few general points that may (or may not!) be helpful.  First, D&#x27;arsonval, Darsonval or any variation thereof is a name for the TYPE of machine, and not the brand name.  Second, there are LOTS of websites available that teach you what HF is, what it&#x27;s good for and how to use each individual electrode.  There are also countless videos on YouTube that offer advice and demonstrations.  If you&#x27;ve never used HF before and have no idea how to use it, WATCH THESE VIDEOS FIRST!  Arm yourself with knowledge before using any machine you are unfamiliar with!  Third, HF creates ozone and has antibacterial properties.  You should use it on CLEAN skin.  If you choose to use it with a moisturizer of some sort, make sure it is alcohol-free.  Also, do not use alcohol to clean your electrodes.  Wipe the glass part ONLY with mild cleanser and water.  Fourth, when used properly, this machine will create a clean and slightly metallic odor.  This is normal.  Fifth, this machine is not intended to stimulate muscles, therefore, you will not feel &#x27;twitching&#x27; or &#x27;jumping&#x27; light you might with other machines.  You may, however, feel a slightly &#x27;zappy&#x27; feeling if the frequency is set too high for your liking.  I hope these tips help!!!</li>
    <li> I wish there were more instructions but you can find more info. on the net about it, I use it a couple times a week,  and I can say that I can see progress. I&#x27;m not expecting miracles. You have to keep up and take care of what you have but this is all part of that maintenance. I&#x27;ll keep it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Have been using this pretty consistently and I believe it&#x27;s really helped with the puffy under eyes, so I&#x27;ll continue on and be very happy I found a great deal on this unit. It won&#x27;t work girls if you don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> I was always willing to try things regardless of some negative feedback. Well I kick myself. There&#x27;s no instructions and you have to take the time researching. I just wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on something like this, so listen to the negative feedback.</li>
    <li> I absolutely luvvvvvv this product..When the product first arrived I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use the machine and wasn&#x27;t sure if I would be electrocuted or not..LOL. The product came with very minimal instruction on usage so I just started tampering with the parts and sort of figured things out. I had this ongoing cough I could not get rid of as a virus and bronchitis along with pneumonia was spreading here in Arizona and many children and adults were taking antibiotics, achy, sore, diarrhea, and this went on for a period of 3 to 4 mos for some. I am not one to quickly visit the Dr. so I started using cough drops and teas and so forth which gave some relief but not much. Everyone kept telling me to go to the Dr. including my children I started using this machine and in two days the cough was completely gone..I&#x27;m not saying whatever frequency/electricity had anything to do with but I found it ironic that the energy or frequency coming from the device made me feel and look better,, I did not disclose to anyone what I had been doing, I use the device on my face which everyone tells me I appear very much well rested..I use on my legs for circulation which I see a difference in appearance, and used on two moles on my stomach area.the moles are semi still there but I will use another treatment which I am sure will be gone in no time. I may not see a significant difference but others see it, and I just feel great! I finally disclosed what I am using. I almost forgot my hair was thinning, I am African American with long curly hair, my hair had started to thin, they say this is typical with aging, something I won&#x27;t except so the comb that comes with the device I used every day along with nutrients such as DHT blockers and scalp cleansers my hair is back to growing rapidly and longer,thicker and healthier..I do attribute this to D&#x27;arsonval..I will be ordering another one soon just to have an extra one here..Thanks a bunch! Great Product..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about 2 weeks now for my acne. I have hormonal acne on my chin and get a couple on my forehead. I use it every night around the same time, my forehead cleared up in a few days and although i didn&#x27;t see immediate results like I was expecting for my hormonal acne I continued with it and I have no more pimples on my chin and I even see the scars fading!  I do not have severe acne, but NOTHING I&#x27;ve been trying has been working (such as african black soap,  benzoyl peroxide, &amp; countless home remedies) until I came across this and I love it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to work as hoped.</li>
    <li> The on / off button stopped going off on the second day of use. So  now its on whenever I plug in.</li>
    <li> I teach skincare... One of my students told me about this.. Works well, great price... I now,  tell all of my students about this item..,</li>
    <li> Ok, I use this everyday and I love it!  What I&#x27;ve noticed the most is the texture of my skin. My skin has gotten so much smoother. I&#x27;m 58 years old and the texture of my skin was not good. I have a ways to go but I&#x27;m seeing nice changes and in combination with the other things I&#x27;m doing  I&#x27;m very excited! I also use a Derma roller, a micro mini current and facial exercises and numerous facial serums.. All of these things in combination has done wonders for me. Because I&#x27;m older I know to expect changes but they will come more slowly. When the changes do come they are often times dramatic so never give up!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I just ordered it.  I used it immediately.  I can already tell this will work beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t bother with  the instructions, instead watch this video, it will teach you how to use it properly and professionally:&lt;br /&gt;How to use the High Frequency Facial Wand Machine&lt;br /&gt; http://youtu.be/YHFZ4FoOnjE</li>
    <li> My wife likes it ok. But, the attachments break easily.</li>
    <li> The instructions were extremely, poorly written and  it did not feel safe to use as an electrical appliance.  No references to handling/safety were included and would not recommend this product≥</li>
    <li> I was excited about this product it arrived on time, however after using this product once the glass spoon separated from the bulb.  It was only glued in.  I would love to get a replacement spoon, no manufacture phone number to contact for defective parts!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple months now.  I had an ugly age spot suddenly show up at the bottom of my neck near my collar bone.  I used this machine and it got rid of it with one treatment.  It took about 3 days to heal as there was a bit of a burn, but it is now gone.  It was not painful at all.  It took about 30 minutes.  I also had brown areas on my face from melasma and I got rid of those spots as well.  Also, you know how after a pimple heals it leaves a mark on your skin.  It will get rid of these acne marks for you too!  I&#x27;ve had nothing but good luck with this machine so far.  I think it&#x27;s a great find for a great price!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes but it didn&#x27;t work or turn on after plugging in the unit. I am returning this product through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am doing what I believe is now my third review since I&#x27;ve recd the unit which was prob just a few weeks ago. I am not a professional ethesti., but I probably have as much experience as the best of them. I am now in my 50&#x27;s and have been giving myself facials since I was 17/18 years old, mainly because somehow I knew I needed to renew my skin on a consistent basis. I can&#x27;t remember ever really having a bump on my face, definitely never any type of acne. My skin was always perfect, model perfect and still is. In the early 90&#x27;s, I brought Linda Evan&#x27;s &#x27;Rejuvenique&#x27; which was like a hard mask with electrodes that you had to put a facial gel on to help the electrical current. This was a pre-cursor to this machine and the dermawand before it. Also, I feel using these type facials relax me, and over time, you will find that also, it becomes somewhat addictive to use. I have to stop myself from using it 2x a day because I just enjoy it so much. A word to all of the people that didn&#x27;t  care for this machine. It works. Regardless of your opinion, it works. I am an expert and I know. I could tell after the first week this is a superior machine. Way superior than the dermawand. From what I&#x27;ve read, there wasnt a single person that used the machine long enough to form a negative opinion. If you are a first time use, yes, you will notice results usually pretty fast, but for some people, it maytake you longer - not a few weeks or even a few months, maybe 4-5 months, and if you havent used it that long, you really dont know. Let me tell you a secret, you skin will begin to respond to the machine and it will crave it.  People always guess my age to be AT LEAST in my 30&#x27;s. My skin is firm, zero wrinkles, firm neck and people always stop me to ask what I use because my skin GLOWS.  When i was young and worked in retail, I was always placed in cosmetics because my skin was perfect and I would sell women very expensive cosmetics that did nothing for them because the technology wasnt really there yet. Now, it&#x27;s here, and you are cheating yourself if you dont try it, maybe not today, but definitely for the future.  I used to sell Mary Kay, which was a great product, dont get me wrong, but I seldom used it myself (rare). I stayed with the regime I always used, my facials and using a micro-current machine as a conductor. I am writing this for all of you on the fence about purchasing it, do yourself a HUGE favor and get it, but don&#x27;t unless you plan to use it, every single day is best, get in the habit and you won&#x27;t be sorry. I am still shaking my head over the quality in this one for the price. It is AMAZING. I will post another review in a few weeks, but I plan to buy myself about 4 more of these (just in case the price shoots up), and everyone I love will get one of these from me for Christmas this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;+eally there yet.

    <li> I am still a little undecided about this product as I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see real results. My one complaint about it is the lack of clear instructions and there is no customer support information or contact details. The instructions were written by someone who clearly does not know the English language and are practically unusable. I think the product may be a good buy but this seller needs to be more customer focused and hire someone who speaks english to write the content for the package and instructions, as well as provide contact information and a customer support number.</li>
    <li> Alrighty, I received my D&#x27;Arsonval HF today and am very impressed so far.  It arrived in perfect condition and even with an adapter to suit Australian power points. I am 42 yrs of age and have noticed in the last two years an increase of fine lines.  It also arrived in perfect time as yesterday I had an inflamed pimpled popping up on my forehead so I have given it the sparkle treatment and the rest of my face a nice soothing application, so lets see how it goes.  At the moment I am very happy with my purchase as I have been involved in the skin care and beauty industry as a sales rep for the last 5 years and know even if you were to have one treatment of this within a facial it would cost more than the unit itself! I am soooo looking forward to using this everyday for results.  I will post at a later date to let you all know how its going!  :-) I will give the extra star once I have used it more often.</li>
    <li> I was surprised when I received the product.  It was very good quality and such a reasonable price compared to other products of it&#x27;s kind.  You will need to watch youtube videos on how to use it as there are no usable instructions included.</li>
    <li> I like the system. However, there are no directions on how long or how often one should use this. I use it for my hair also, but I have not noticed any difference. Then , it could be because I don&#x27;t know how long I should use it for. One minute. twp three--who knows?</li>
    <li> I just received this today. After speaking with my friend who is a electrical engineer, I found out that using these types of devices on a regular basis can change the molecular structure of your cells and even promote/cause cancer. I know most people just buy, try and either love it or hate it. We put so much focus on what we eat, I think we should also be aware of what goes onto our skin. As far as my first try, I used the mushroom wand and just turned it on. I put it on the palm of my hand first and then on my face. Even at the lowest setting, I can still feel a warm, tingling sensation 20 minutes later. Once I am familiar with it I may write another review about my experience and any changes that occur, good or bad. Be careful. It doesn&#x27;t shock you but it can burn you. Knowledge is power, do the homework not only regarding use but find out the health risks!</li>
    <li> I ordered this in January and received it way ahead of time, all in good condition.  I have been using it now for 8 weeks, faithfully twice a week.  I have cystic acne and I am very happy with the smallest tube where you can just zap the pimple.  I noticed that every time I feel a pimple coming up and I zap it with the wand, it prevents it from coming up the surface of my skin. One thing though, don&#x27;t make the frequency too high, you might get dark blemishes-then would have to use a bleach cream to lighten it up.  Besides the face, I also use the other wands on my neck and chest, even my back.</li>
    <li> Great product! Skipping some appointments at the beauty salon!&lt;br /&gt;It arrived fast but the wand did not work. I sent it back and it was replaced promptly with a new one.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it and I am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I would reccomend this seller to my friends.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference the next day. My eyes were more open wide...not so tired looking.  I would have given it a 5 star but the little metal cap on one of the tubes fell off.  I like the smallest tube the best and do the sparkle method.  That is when you hold the device a little away from your skin and it really zaps you!!  It does hurt a little but it really does the job.  I have no regrets at all....even with the broken tube.  I think its a great quality for the money.  I can always get another glass tube.  They are not meant to last anyway.</li>
    <li> I works good and I can feel a tingling sensation in my face and neck, but as far getting rid of wrinkles I can&#x27;t say that. I probably use it 2 to 3 times a week on one side of my face, didn&#x27;t noticed any diference from other side. Still I think it works for massaging and keep it from aging any more.</li>
    <li> This product is really good for skin. it&#x27;s help a lot to have a better, nice and clean skin. If you have acne, try it and&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;ll be amazed. If your skin is older; the &amp;#34;mushroom&amp;#34; head help to tightening skin. very good quality of products.&lt;br /&gt;Have a nice skin it&#x27;s a fact with this products !!!</li>
    <li> I bought  the high frequency set for myself several months ago and the texture of my skin is much better.  It took a few months to see a difference but I am seeing a difference.  I bought a second unit for my sister, the main unit went out shortly after she got her product but I had no problem getting it replaced, my request for an exchange was quickly handled and a replacement unit was delivered within two weeks.  The instructions that come with the unit aren&#x27;t that great but I googled the unit and found some very detailed instructions that work just fine.  My star rating is based on the results I am seeing and service I have received from  the the client.</li>
    <li> Interesting. Nice tingly feeling like an electrical charge. Pleasant intimate toy to use with your partner at a fraction of the cost of the real Violet-light...&lt;br /&gt;We also used an attachment with this called the &amp;#34;Kinklab Power Tripper&amp;#34; available here at Amazon...  Not for the faint-of-heart!!!&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B007VXVBFM Kinklab Power Tripper]]&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the the Power Tripper it was good with light to medium sparks/zaps...  The second time was with another friend and she was shocked. We both were...  I had the power set at the lowest setting but we were shocked enough to give it up...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them both but go with caution!!!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting as much as I got with this unit. It appears to work very well, but be carefull.  One glass attachment came loose from the metal plug.  I just glued it back in.</li>
    <li> I like the product but gave it a 4 because the directions were totally useless. I estimate 9 out of 10 people will not use a product that saps your skin with inadequate instruction. I&#x27;m a chemist.</li>
    <li> my wife was loving this until the glue started coming off on the glass and now the metal piece is stuck inside the machine and now its useless. she also got a random shock out of no where.</li>
    <li> helluva violet wand replacement if you like such things but are on a budget. or if youre not sure if youve ever wanted a violet wand for D/s play, then this would be an inexpensive way to experiment</li>
    <li> I had never used one of these before and I think I used it improperly the first time, however doing it a different way the next was the solution...I did the sparkle method and it made a huge difference in my skin!  Love it!  No problems with the machine as well!  The best way to pull out the electrodes (one reviewer suggested paper towels, but I still found this hard to do) is to use jar opener grippers or the rubber type cabinet liners that you can just cut a strip off to grip them with and now I can pop them in and out with ease without the fear of breaking them!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this. I am not seeing incredible or immediate results, but  there are definitely changes! My granddaughter uses it for her acne and it just disappears overnight!</li>
    <li> Expected high quality. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I gave this item 4 stars because the instruction booklet that came with it was not too detailed. The only reason I purchased it  was for the comb rake, so that was pretty easy to figure out how to use. Just hope product does what it say it will do!</li>
    <li> OMG! This is the coolest device I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;m also a licensed aesthetician and I can tell you the quality of this device is worth way more then what I paid. It did take a few weeks to get to me but considering it came from Hong Kong and I ordered it right after Thanksgiving complaining isn&#x27;t really an option. Buy this device it is worth it.</li>
    <li> The cord broke after 2 uses. threw it out, should have returned it but it was my second one of these already.</li>
    <li> I got this item in a record 4 buisness days... when I opened it , it was just as promised.  took a little getting used too but this product really works... I had some old bruises that never went away and it removed them.... Im so pleased.  for the price and what it does its definately worth the money.  The only thing that concerns me is the mushroom fitting  broke out of the casing.  I think because I used to much presure on it... so make sure your careful.. hope this helps anyone interested... Highly recommend this product.!</li>
    <li> After reading reviews I was able to begin using immediately.  Have used the mushroom and spoon shaped attachments. I gently and quickly place on target area,because the spark method is to strong for me,at the moment.  With mine you do not screw into brace, but slowly push into socket area. So, I really like this product. Will update later. I can still feel the stimulation to the areas I worked on over five minutes ago. I received it swiftly and as stated. It was in a sturdy box with foams in demotions for the attachments.  I cannot wait to really work with this tool.</li>
    <li> The hair attachment makes your head feel wonderful but have not used enough to rate other attachments</li>
    <li> Metal knot broke off inside tube.  Had to use pryer to get it out handle, not good!  should make these better.</li>
    <li> Great personal use high frequency device. I prefer a professional device but this good enough for home use.</li>
    <li> Package is come with one item broken, which can not replace as idividual item.so i decide not to return so i can start using right way.</li>
    <li> I love this product it does work. I use a little cocoa butter cream and use as directed. I was surprised it worked so well. I would recommend anyone to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Just like a neon wand you can get at a sex store for $189. Works in US outlet. Funny directions.</li>
    <li> I am going to order another one for my mother. She and I love this device. Kills all bacteria and cleared my skin .</li>
    <li> I have not used this item and can not get an australian adapter to fit it.I am still trying to get one.if not will be returning this item.Have sent away to try and get one today which cost me $48 aust dollars.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get a manual or a cd on how to use it.  I would had like better if it came with more information.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I just wish they would sell the wands separated , I had bough 2 sets and i keep on breaking the same  one wand, it&#x27;s so hard to buy the wand by it&#x27;s self cuz I don&#x27;t know what size it is  , and who knows if it would fit cuz they all are different brands .</li>
    <li> Still sitting on my shelf unused.. I don&#x27;t have enough knowledge about how to use it. The instructions are too brief.</li>
    <li> excelent item., as good as described. Easy to use and lightweight so my workers are not tired. i recomend it</li>
    <li> Ok... so the fourty train is rapidly approching, and with no breaks aboard. My vintage skin has become dry, and acne prone. Add frekles and sun spots! (&#x27;train wrecked&#x27;) Very weary of this product, but willing to try anything. I have owned it for a month, and use it 2-4 times a week. It has drasticly improved fine lines, reduced pore size, and lightened spots to improve overall skin tone. My skin is fair, and I have a hard time finding a product that doesnt over dry my skin. The electrodes actually stimulate skin to do what it should be doing in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;Unless you can avoid the train stops at Momsville sleepless nights, this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> hard to control the amount of current and it looses then picks up current a little shocking to say the least</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me and had a yukky smell too!</li>
    <li> This product does zap breakouts quickly, and after brief usage of about three minutes the skin does glow after usage.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice lifting, after only a week of use, but I do see a glow.  The unit can be used with cream or gels on the face, but not water.  It is not painful even at the highest setting.  Nastypuppys video is well worth watching because the written instructions provided have been translated from another language and they are difficult to understand as the translation is obviously off.  If you do NOT want to experience a slight, but not very painful, shock, please be sure to shut the unit off before installing or changing the glass tubes.  Although the shock is not extremely painful, it may startle you and cause you to drop the glass tubes.  Update April 7, 2015:  I am still happy with this product.  The unit I received is still working since original purchase.  It is used at least once weekly sometimes more. I am not quite sure I see a permanent lifting, but I generally have good skin and maybe I just don&#x27;t notice.  However, it does make the skin glow and seem healthier the day of use.  It does also seem to zap breakouts more quickly.</li>
    <li> I was going to write this an amazing review but it quit completely yesterday after just 2 1/2 months.  I should explain that I am in my middle seventies and this thing still worked amazingly well, I could see results in a few days.  I used it for about 5 minutes daily.  It took 15 years off the backs of my hands - I swear.  I don&#x27;t know if I will see further improvement or if by now I am just on maintenance.  They only guarantee it for one month I think so consider that before purchasing.  I liked it so much I ordered another one right after the first one - on Amazon but another shipper, so I am not doing without.&lt;br /&gt;If you spend more than $10 a month for facial treatments then this will save you money.  I am interested in how long my second one will last, but I will definitely continue buying and using them.&lt;br /&gt;I just use Argon oil now and quit buying expensive face creams so I will consider that in the cost of using this wand.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Hello I bought two of these . I received only one at was going back and fourth with the owner about why I didnt receive my second box. After  a week of back and fourth the owner sent me the second box. I think it was an honest mistake and he did the rigjt thing and sent me the second box so tour dealing with a trustworthy person. As for the product. Its very good. Just dont drop the tips cuz they shatter even with minimal impact</li>
    <li> I do like the adjustable setting. I will admit that I need to get into the habit of using it on a routine basis.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Been using for a while no problems.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Wife. With Very little instructions from the product itself, I found this information about it.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it helps with some of the questions about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Will update in a few months to see how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Stopped working. Did not see any good results by using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Junk!!!</li>
    <li> product does not perform as expected....this product was purchased with high expectation...  It does not perform as outlined in the literature..</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would offer the power I prefer as an option in my facials; it does.  Don&#x27;t bother with the more expensive units, this one is more than enough to meet your high frequency needs.</li>
    <li> I notice a firmer skin, I love it. It is worth its price. My make up looks so much better after using this product and my face without make up looks so smooth, with smaller pores. It looks like I glow. I love it,  love it, love it!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have beeen complimented beyond my expections! My pores WEERE GIGANTIC, NO MORE! I Microdrem w/ Neutrogeno microdermabrasion 2x a week and use this every night with my moisturizer. I have to admit that when used w/ moisturizer, the next morning my face is still mosit. I also use this if I have a big thing to go to. I use the sparkle method 3 x a week. and small lines have gone away! My Aunt whom does not give out compliments asked what are you using and I did it on her face, she loves it and wants one! I am now on the highest strength. The pieces that come wih it are kind of commo sense.&lt;br /&gt;1. The small electron is for small areas like below eyes&lt;br /&gt;2. The big piece round if for larger areas such as theh face&lt;br /&gt;3.Then the comb, obvious reasons.&lt;br /&gt;If you have pimples take peroxide and then use this machine. I do not use gause I just use it all over my face! enjoy it really is an awesome product and you will see a difference. Example, use the sparkle method (which is lifting the wand just 1 half in above the face) along any lines you wish to have gone. May take a ew but it works. I also use Glycolic acid 50% 2 x a week on the same areas w/ lines so combined the 3 products work in harmony!</li>
    <li> I have used the D&#x27;arsonval for a week now.  Once a day for about twenty minutes over entire face and neck; and focusing on more wrinkled areas.  I use Essence of Argan oil on my face first, then massage with the D&#x27;arsonval.  You must have an oil base on your face first, to slide the D&#x27;arsonval over face smoothly.  I have noticed a considerable improvement in my wrinkled areas!  This is actually the first time I have noted an improvement in such a short time.</li>
    <li> One of the wands broke taking it on and off the first week.I got no instructions and really don&#x27;t know what to do</li>
    <li> Wonderful product - does what it says &amp; more! I would &amp; will reccomemd to friends! I can&#x27;t believe how great it works &amp; the price is wonderfol!</li>
    <li> Product arrive in great time and good shape but no where was the voltage listed in the product description. It is 220V and I bought it for use in the US which needs 120V. Make sure to check your voltage needs and the product before buying.</li>
    <li> I decided to get this as I suffer from cystic acne. It&#x27;s not all over my face but once in awhile I get one and it&#x27;s HUGE and takes forever to go away. Not to mention painful.&lt;br /&gt;I have very oily skin and I get facials regularily(every 3 months). The lady that does my facials always uses a high frequency machine on me at the end of my facial. It does not hurt it&#x27;s just a little loud. The noise it makes it&#x27;s scarier than anything.&lt;br /&gt;My facial lady swears by this machine and from having it done for over two years when I get a facial, I had no complaints. So I figured I should buy one.&lt;br /&gt;She showed me one and it looked exactly like this one. So when I saw this one on Amazon and it was more than half of what it would cost me to purchase it from her I figured I would try it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this machine for about 3 weeks now and I have no complaints. I&#x27;ve gotten 1 cystic pimple in those 3 weeks and it didn&#x27;t last as long as they normally do.&lt;br /&gt;However my overall skin on my face seems a lot better. It&#x27;s smoother and looks more radiant.&lt;br /&gt;Now I did read there are two kinds of high frequency machines. Each uses a different gas. One is red and one is purple. This machine has the red gas. I&#x27;m not sure if that is &amp;#34;for&amp;#34; acne prone skin or not but so far I really like this machine.</li>
    <li> This item lasts about a year before things start falling apart.  Based on the price, I actually ordered a replacement from a different vendor.  Let&#x27;s hope that one lasts a little longer.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this machine. I used it after extracting anything off my face and it helps heal the wound faster</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t but this if you really don&#x27;t know what it is.  Read carefully.</li>
    <li> I liked this  product.&lt;br /&gt;Just like many other people&#x27;s reviews the instructions are terrible. Obviously a bad attempt to translate into English.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this in November 2014, I do not use it everyday. I have used it about a dozen or so times. The last time I went to use it the power  was greatly diminished. It seems like it now only has about 1/8 - 1/4 the power it previously had.&lt;br /&gt;I checked the website, it is supposed to have a 6 month warranty. There should still be one month on the warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried find out how to contact the seller, you have to dig through links that take you to the same place. I have not been able to find how to contact the seller, or get an exchange on this item.</li>
    <li> this item is very dangerous near eyes.I got a refund.</li>
    <li> First of all, I would like to say that I am 51 years old and 138lbs. I have always taken care of my skin and up until the last 2 years, everyone would say I look 10 years younger than I am. So, the last 2 years have really taken a toll mostly around my mouth and the marionette lines. Also, I sleep on my side so I have been really disturbed by the giant V crease on my chest that has been getting deeper and deeper the last 5 years. The back of my legs have really increased in cellulite and like most women, I have stretch marks along my belly. So I have only had the D&#x27;arsonval for about 1 week and already I have seen NOTICEABLE reduction in wrinkles around my eyes and mouth, reduction in pore size, cellulite indentation and stretch mark ridges. I have been using it 2 times a day all over for 11 days. My adult daughter also bought one for her acne which is pretty bad, I will post again about whether that works or not. Oh, and I have started getting hooded eyelids and this is also helping with that too. It is not as dramatic as they show on some of the commercials for the the other brand Dermawand, but nothing works overnight. I saw one ad that ran the wand across her eyelid to her brow and the skin just stayed there...as if she wasn&#x27;t just raising her eyebrow and holding it there. I saw another ad though of 2 women who were in their 60&#x27;s and said they&#x27;d been using the device for ten years. My mouth dropped because they look like they were in their 40&#x27;s. That&#x27;s what really sold me.</li>
    <li> My sister bought me a Hi-Frequency machine from an esthetician&#x27;s trade show a couple years back.  I absolutely LOVED it.  I have extreme acne &amp; boils and using the machine on my break outs 2-3 times a week, cleared up all skin problems.  Unfortunately, after two years it finally gave out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this one, I was delighted that I could start controlling my acne once again.  Unfortunately, this product did not have enough power.  It barley lit up &amp; even on the highest setting it just didn&#x27;t work.  I don&#x27;t know if I just received a defective one or if this machine is just super weak.  Anyway,  I am returning it right away &amp; going to purchase another one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is working on my skin as it&#x27;s supposed to.  I suppose it is too early to say, and I haven&#x27;t been consistent in using it.  Also,  I am 32, so I don&#x27;t have some of the skin issues it supposedly fixes.  I was hoping to do a little preventive maintenance on my face and to help reduce black heads.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t purchase the more expensive dermawand.  It does scare me a bit that the directions are in choppy English, so I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m using it correctly.  I guess I am nuetral on the product.  For the price it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try it!</li>
    <li> I like it and use it for removal of skin tags, etc.</li>
    <li> great item just as describe by the seller, easy to used and assembled, and it helps the skin look better after a couple of weeks</li>
    <li> If I didn&#x27;t know how to use this product, and only relied on the manual, I&#x27;d throw this away and find something that has a manual in a proper English translation. I was under impression that they took whatever language the original manual was written in, stuck this into free on-line translator and then copied and pasted it into Word and printed on a home ink-jet printer.</li>
    <li> superb for hair growth</li>
    <li> Maybe I am missing something, but for wrinkles and fine lines should be used indirect method, and this is actually being mentioned in included instructions&lt;br /&gt;The thing is straight electrode for indirect method is not included, so how do you suppose to use it? I can&#x27;t even find where to buy straight electrode separately&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;direct method dries your skin and is being used to treat acne, which is probably working just fine, but that was not the main point for me to buy it&lt;br /&gt;So, device itself is fine, but title and description is misleading&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll leave it as it&#x27;s not very expensive, and I may occasionally use for it acne and for hair,&lt;br /&gt;but if I knew upfront that it&#x27;s not being intended to use for wrinkles then I wouldn&#x27;t buy it on the first place&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if anybody knows how to use this for wrinkles and fine lines, please comment on my review :)</li>
    <li> Has helped with sagging jowls and lines around mouth. Also helped zap zits.  Have tried other products and this one is easy to use and the cost is a bargain.  Recommend using aloe very gel with it.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Just got one for myself and my daughter in law. Went to use mine today and it does not have a plug you can use in USA  dont know where this comes from as the instruction book is in very bad English. I was very disappointed. There was also a pair of gloves in mine which were not in my daughter in laws so I dont know if I got used product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems so far in using this product. Because of the detailed reviews, there were no surprises. There is much to repair, improve and I don&#x27;t expect overnight results on old wrinkles and sagging. I have taken a \\&quot;before\\&quot; picture and hopefully will have a good \\&quot;after\\&quot; to provide with a future review. I will say that with the first session my skin looked almost like I&#x27;d had a spa facial.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase at first, but after watching nastypuppy video review, i decided to make a purchased. I&#x27;m not actually sure if they shipped me the correct product, because the outlet plug does not have holes in them in the prongs like in nastypuppys video review. Does anyone know if no holes in the plug prongs is suitable for U.S. outlet use and voltage?  Sooo confused now... Thanks!</li>
    <li> I was having problems with sun spots and freakles all over my face, Ive tried all kinds of skin lightening lotions but nothing worked, so I ordered the high frequency machine to try it out, it came very fast in the mail and everything was packed good too.. I tried it that day and later that night, had no problem but I had a hard time getting use to the smell it leaves on your face. After using it a few times it wasnt so bad but I have seen a great differents. My face looks clearer with less spots.Love this machine and I will update you with more later cause Ive only had this machine for about 2 weeks.  *Update on using the high frequency machine, Ive had this machine for little over a month now and I use it every night, it has cleared most of my sun spots on my face and neck.. love it!!</li>
    <li> For the money, this can&#x27;t be beat.  Although you need to get instructions from U Tube, they are easily located.  It really does what it says--firming, reducing fine lines, toning and an excellent way to zap any blemishes before they get out of hand.  I will buy another when this one wears out.</li>
    <li> Shipping:It came relatively fast. 2 days ago (about 6 business days)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prep:It&#x27;s important that you clean your face really well before and that afterwards you avoid the direct sunlight, and moisturize with SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen any fine lines diminish yet, but my skin is looking a lot more awake (JUST 2 DAYS), texture is a lot softer, more even tone, no need to use make up and I applied it to a bruise I had on my leg (pretty purple, #ridingbikeproblems), Today it&#x27;s literally gone, usually my bruises last about 4-6 days, depending how purple it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy with this purchase! Would totally recommend it to others. The key thing with this system is like everything else in life Consistency!!!</li>
    <li> I just got this product. Actually it arrived really fast I was expecting this product to arrive mid May so i am very pleased with the service. I opened the nice looking box and the product is perfect. the booklet as other reviews stated is hard to understand but I did find in youtube a video that explains everything very clearly so I don&#x27;t think I will have any problem. I am giving it 4 starts because I haven&#x27;t tried it yet so I will give it a week or so and I will be adding some comments to my review.</li>
    <li> But didnt try till now.ouch!(just a bit) skin red-looks a bit better-gonna keep on with it.BTW -Im on my husbands acct (I spend too much at times &amp;cant afford to) So please kno that this is a womans review and not a mans!  :) -so when u see his name on something that is beauty related-its the MRS! ;)</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all, and I used this faithfully every morning and every evening for about three weeks.  I am still going to try hoping that it is just taking a long time, after all, I have already spent the money on it.</li>
    <li> it does not deliver what it promised...do not buy this, you will just waste your money, it does not work...</li>
    <li> PERSONALLY, MY MOTHER AND I USE IT....&lt;br /&gt;DIFFERENT PURPOSES......&lt;br /&gt;SHE HAS HYPERPIGMENTATION AROUND HER CHEEK AREA, AND WE&#x27;VE SEEN A DIFFERENCE..&lt;br /&gt;YOU MUST BE PATIENT OF COURSE, TO SEE CHANGES, BUT  BELIEVE ME, YOU&#x27;LL BE SURPRISED.&lt;br /&gt;I CANNOT COMPARE IT TO ANY OTHER PRODUCT FOR THE FACT THAT I&#x27;VE ONLY USED THIS ONE...&lt;br /&gt;BUT PUT IT THIS WAY...... MY MOTHER AND I HAVE NOT BOTHERED TO VISIT ANY ESTHETICIANS OFFICE FOR AN IPL TREATMENT...</li>
    <li> Better and cheaper than Derma Wand. I use it 3 or 4 times a week and have given me excellent results and I am over 60 years of age. Of course I always wear very good facial creams day and night. Yes I do recommend it highly</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the HF for a some time with great results in my hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. And a great price online.</li>
    <li> I borrowed this machine from my sister to test it out before purchasing. Although I didn&#x27;t see any drastic results just yet, I did notice a difference. That was enough for me to make a $30 purchase and give the product a long term shot. Upon opening the package, I found the glass tubes inside to look used and have residues on then, which is pretty disgusting for a skin care product that was sold as &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;. For that reason, I am not 100% happy.</li>
    <li> I had a Derma Wand for several months when I dropped it and broke the bulb.i guess you cannot buy just the bulb so I decided to try this product.  It worked much better in one treatment than the Derma did the whole few months I had it.  People never noticed with the Derma wand but the first time I used the D&#x27;arsonval I had several friends tell me how good I looked and asked me what I was doing.  The only bad thing is all the attachments are glass and when I received this in the mail the comb was broken.  I decided to go ahead and keep it since I did not plan to use the comb anyway.</li>
    <li> Super facial toning device. Have had micro current therapy for many many years and have held off aging process absolutely!  And for the pricing very wonderful.  Do not need to use on highest frequency, just click on lowest setting and it is enough to stimulate the collagen under the skin and tone and stimulate circulation.</li>
    <li> I received the unit today and it lost its power within minutes.  I turned the dial to try the variations of intensity. I could feel the variations on my face. Five minutes later,  I turned the dial to increase the power and the power would not increase. It felt the same from the lowest setting to the highest setting. Perhaps I was sent a defective unit. I am returning the device.</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this to help her skin tone and more importantly her circulation of her right knee months after surgery. She loves it, and the improvement is very visible. She researched several brands and this has proven to be both affordable and effective.</li>
    <li> works great easy to use, I loved the video the other person sent in ,I used it to help me out ,really nice an cheaper than dermawand</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for my wife based on previous positive reviews and was not disappointed at all.&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> I have been using it every day and I really don&#x27;t see any results. I still have the brown sun spots and the wrinkles. I do have to say, two people have commented on my face. One person said my face had a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; and she sees me every day. The other person has not seen me in a couple of years and wanted to know what I have been doing, because I look younger. I would recommend taking a picture of yourself before you start using this, I wish I did. I have been using Physicians Formula Deep Wrinkle Corrector Day &amp; Night Cream with this, because you need to put something on your face, so the tip will slide across your face. I will keep using it for a while longer and if I see any improvement, I will post another comment.</li>
    <li> Could give it a higher rating if the directions had been better.  There was not an illustration of how best to use it.  What directions there are seemed to have been written by someone that English was not their first language.</li>
    <li> It broke in the 1st week.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I read the other reviews in Amazon and also because of the price. I wanted to buy the Dermawand but then I discovered this device for a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 62 years old and I see a difference on my skin. I use it just about every night starting with the hair attachment, then the facial attachment (the medium size one that looks like a spoon) then the larger one on my thighs.&lt;br /&gt;On my legs I use it in conjunction with Nivea Q10 Skin Firming Cellulite Serum. My skin feels a lot firmer.&lt;br /&gt;Granted it only works on your skin and if you want to look more youthful, you need to add face exercises (my humble advice)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first ordered it one of the attachments broke after the third day. Amazon was very accommodating as usual and I returned it and got a new one that has been working just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minuses I see about this product is the lack of instructions. The piece of paper that comes with it, has English words but it is gibberish. I was not written by someone who comprehends the English language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Worked a couple of times and then it just died. Too bad. I was hoping to see what it could do.</li>
    <li> Excellent for pimples, will go way within 2 days... not sure if will improve facial lines because I don&#x27;t use enough.</li>
    <li> It was too painful to use.  Saw no improvement from the use of this product.  I did get a refund. Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> this is a great value.  try it at this price...same as in spa</li>
    <li> This is thing stopped working after on month. Worst product ever</li>
    <li> Amazingly, this cured my toenail fungus. It bothered me for years, (and though you can keep it &amp;#34;in control&amp;#34; with Vick&#x27;s Vaporub the oiliness of it stains the socks and even shoes). I was just going to have my nail laser treated (but was too lazy). I moved the small tip over the infected nail for about a minute - and the fungus was gone. Dead. Going to a laser place would have cost at least twice what this machine cost. I gave the nail heat treatment for a week, just in case, but I really do think it was gone after the first time.&lt;br /&gt;The instruction leaflet is crazy like everyone says, but the machine is simple to use. One of the tips broke and the metal was left in the machine, but I got it out with superglue. And I don&#x27;t care - I&#x27;m just happy my toe is okay, so five stars!</li>
    <li> I used it continuously for about ten days and didn&#x27;t see any wonders,But there was a little change, maybe I don&#x27;t know how to use it. As the reviews said that it makes our skin very&lt;br /&gt;dry,I used a heavy moisturiser before using it so it helped.&lt;br /&gt;  For a beginner it&#x27;s very confusing on how to start as there&lt;br /&gt;is no how to use it information provided with it to get the best&lt;br /&gt;results ,you r on ur own experimenting and trying to learn .I&#x27;m still figuring out how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;  For the price paid ,I&#x27;m not very worried so, I&#x27;ll wait for some more time before I write my final review whether to continue using it or put it to trash.</li>
    <li> I am 28 years old female with deep acne scarring and uneven skin tone and puffy eyes all day all night. I have been using this machine religiously for one week, once in the morning and once at night for 10 mins. I see difference in skin tone, now my skin is not so dull, its glowing!! I can see blood circulation beneath my skin! I no longer use heavy foundation. and stopped using blush!!!you have to try it if you want your face if you want the results i described above. Also, smaller pores for sure but I still have room for improvment. Unfortunately, puffy eyes did not go away at all. that&#x27;s why i took one star off. I tried messaging the tube around my eyes and still doesnt work. Anyone suggestions on how to improve puffy eyes with this tool?</li>
    <li> This product requires directions on proper use. It can be dangerous and painful if you don&#x27;t know what your doing. Be careful and do your research before buying.</li>
    <li> My plastic surgeon uses this in his practice for his microdermabrasion, at $150.00 each this product is a STEAL! I LOVE IT. Use it all the time to kill bacteria in acne that may be coming up. Prevents the start of acne. MUST HAVE.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to see some improvement of the fine lines around my mouth and the wrinkles on my forehead. I really feel like I literally wasted good money. Not worth buying!!</li>
    <li> I just started using this device so not sure how well it works.  I do feel my skin is tighter but have not notice any changes in fine lines. I would view utube guidance on product use. Instructions as comfusing.</li>
    <li> Be sure to put the tubes in and out of the wand by using gentle pressure at the base of the glass tube so as not to jam it in or risk breaking the glass. I bought this not for skin care but rather as a Violet Wand in BDSM electric sensation play.  My Dominant and I are not sure how often and much we will utilize the VIolet Wand within our scenes so this is a cheap option to experiment with before investing a more expensive/expansive violet wand.</li>
    <li> TOTAL WASTE OF TIME, ENERGY, MONEY.  Pleasant to use, no damage done, but after 10-15 mins a day for 3 months and not one tiny visible sign of improvement, what else can I conclude about this except - it&#x27;s a gimmick to make someone a lot of money.  I&#x27;m using 100%, pure, organic, cold pressed Argan oil as the &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s really great for anyone to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not let anyone also tell you that COLAGIN lotion, oil, creams, etc., can make you look better, younger, etc., that&#x27;s a myth.  Research Argan oil on line before you buy and do not waste your money, time or energy on this contraption - it&#x27;s a throw back to the 1920&#x27;s when they had all sorts of quackery to sell women to look thinner, younger, etc. Just use the best skin oil you can afford to buy (I get mine here), use sun screen, and stay out of the sun!!!  I&#x27;m 69 and look extremely good for my years, but every day I used this, I felt like an idiot and now I know why!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s beautifully packaged but the directions are in broken English and make no sense whatsoever.  I had to watch &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; videos on You Tube to even know what to do with it.  All in all, save your money ladies and benefit from my mistake.  Happy New Year, 2015!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as it said it would !</li>
    <li> I got this for one reason – the sparkle setting! Research this if you&#x27;re unfamiliar. It&#x27;s so easy to do and it will stop any break out in its tracks faster than any topical cream or anything else available. Expensive facialists use this technique, but you can do it at home.</li>
    <li> It is super effective!&lt;br /&gt;Zit takes 25 damage.&lt;br /&gt;Zit faints.&lt;br /&gt;You gain 20 experience.&lt;br /&gt;You Level up.&lt;br /&gt;Your complexion goes up by 3.&lt;br /&gt;You learn a new spell &amp;#34;self confidence&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Worked great for the first 3 weeks and then went dead! Be sure to watch the return policy. Ugh!</li>
    <li> Love it.  See results after 1 use. The more you use it the better you will look. Has gotten rid of deep wrinkles around mouth nose area</li>
    <li> came with pamplet only  no instructions on how use the applicators it comes with or how long your suppose to use</li>
    <li> first time amazon buyer, i was confused how online purchasing worked, and when I received a broken piece I was pissed and didn&#x27;t want to use amazon again ever again, but experiencing the quick and awesome service I got, I might just get used to online shopping.&lt;br /&gt;  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product received a broken one, contacted the seller (HESHUN INC) replaced the broken product and received the package in 4 days&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping, GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! i am customer for life to this company. Now at last i can use this product hopefully, this one works out good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now off to buy paraffin bath and derma brush, how much we ladies have to go thru to look good. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------- FIRST REVIEW-----&lt;br /&gt;I used this machine for two days and on the second day, electrode became loose . when I was using it I  felt the glass moving and&lt;br /&gt; I checked the glass part had come off and the silver part stuck in the machine.  Maybe i was given a old machine or used machine where the glue dried up. very dissatisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> My skin looks a little clearer but I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in firmness. Also, the current seem to go in and out if you hold the device down too firmly, so you have to be careful not to push too hard. I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t buy the several hundred dollar Dermawand and tried this $30+ one instead.</li>
    <li> After using this product for over 1 month it is not producing the results that is advertised.  Disappointed in the product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe what a useless tool this thing is. I t does NOTHING except make a small humming sound, it is without a doubt the biggest waste of time and money I have ever come across.DO NOT BUY THIS....IT&#x27;S WORTHLESS!!!</li>
    <li> I love this and it is a great value for the money. I just wish it was a little stronger.</li>
    <li> This is the same exact item an erotic sex toy called neon wand by kinky labs. I found this video demo. If you doubt me&lt;br /&gt;Watch this. So with that in mind how can anyone take this device seriously. I will file a complaint to amazon. I guess this item is sold like snake oil. Lol buyer beware !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Go to YouTube and search for neon wand curvy mason. Same attachments same unit exact</li>
    <li> Product was received quickly, all in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;I use it as it is a massaging device, it is pleasant and fun to look at the glow.  I like the smell of ozon, too. I am not waiting for immediate skin tightening or something, but I will use it as a additional skin treatment.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this- which is pretty surprising, because i had never heard of this brand. I had been using the Dermawand with very minimal results, and one day I dropped it and it broke. I was going to buy another one, but I came across this item. It was less than half the price, so I went ahead and bought it. I am much happier with this than the dermawand. It comes with a few attachments, all of them have a bigger surface then the Dermawand did and I can actually feel it working. I do believe in the short time I have been using it that i do see a tightening. It does not come with great instructions though, so look up instructions on line if your not sure how to use it.</li>
    <li> I see a difference in the texture, tone and brightness in my skin.  I see some tightening, but I haven&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;used it long enough.</li>
    <li> Its ok I gave it to Aunt because of hair loss. We let you know more later. Not real impressed</li>
    <li> I bought this because my doctor uses this to stimulate my scalp and kill infection. Im in really early stages of baldness and decided to go to a doctor, turns out that I have some fungi infection eating my folicles so they use this device to stimulate scalp and kill the bacteria and some other procedures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I research a little bit and found this on Amazon, for $20 decided to give it a go since it is the exact same thing my doctor uses. And it&#x27;s great, I have used it frequently for about two weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair is stronger and much less hairloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aditionally I have some acne problems, a bit serious problems, had some scabbing and dead skin over a layer of pimples all over my cheeks. Decided to try the facial insertions and they worked great, I have been using them for two weeks too and I have seen great results, my acne is almost clear and the scabbing is completely gone. Also, I have never used any soaps or treatment before trying this so I KNOW the results must come from this treatment.</li>
    <li> Omg it&#x27;s amazing . Seriously . I bought more expensive machines but this one beats them all . I was so surprised and happy !!!!!</li>
    <li> This high frequency wand is easy to use and and had an off/ on button.....which is good because u don&#x27;t have to in plug unit...</li>
    <li> Once again, was it written by an American?  There is no explanation for the use for the different tools.  I went to esthetician school &amp; had to go there to find out how to use it.  I still don&#x27;t know exactly what tool is for what!</li>
    <li> This is your classic quack device, it has NO HEALTH EFFECTS WHATSOEVER. It will not cure any skin condition (bacteria is hardy and will survive any of the abuse), it will not regrow hair (nor will running a vibrator through your scalp.) These devices have been around for hundreds of years, and there&#x27;s no truth to any of these claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it ~does~ have off-label usage for non-medical \\&quot;conditions\\&quot;, and appears to be the same model sold elsewhere for 2-7x as much.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the results from this machine.  i have had it for 5 months.  However the other night the glass wand came out of the unit and i cannot get the metal piece out so i am unable to use the machine.  Any ideas on how to be able to use it again.  i dont have a pair of needle nose pliers.</li>
    <li> So far so good I do notice a difference used for 30 days. I might see even more of a difference if I use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> Used for well over 6 months every day with no results. It feels kind of good after you get used to it.  But, don&#x27;t waste your money - doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
    <li> As a Licensed Aesthetician, my school offered Direct High Frequency to their clients. Having now started working in the industry, I was looking for a High Frequency machine that would be affordable and be able to travel with me. It came, right on time and I was able to use it on not only myself, but my client (Who loved it!) My client saw definitive results and loved what they saw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. I plan on ordering the argon glass nodes as well. This is truly an amazing product.</li>
    <li> Wow, I LOVE this thing!  It really, really works!  My skin likes the nice flow of oxygen and blood flow which makes the skin healthier and more youthful looking.  My pores are definitely responding to this tool, they definitely look smaller.  I have a freckle on the bridge of my nose that some people think is a smudge of dirt that has gotten darker as I get older.  This tool is definitely working to lighten it up.  Also, I tend to have breakouts on my back and the attachment they include for just that works wonders.  I was amazed that I used it on a blemish, held it there for 10 seconds, I did that twice.  I looked at it and though, &amp;#34;nah, this won&#x27;t do anything!&amp;#34;.  The next morning, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the blemish was not inflamed, it was flattened out and starting to &amp;#34;heal&amp;#34;.  Within 2 days of the treatment, the blemish was gone, and just a small flake of skin remained.  Excellent value, excellent product.  I am looking forward to even greater results as time goes on.  Just look on Youtube there are a couple  excellent videos on how to properly use this tool since the instructions that come with it are difficult to follow. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> Bought this for a gift, good for the price.</li>
    <li> I was originally was interested in the Dermawand (my friend has one and I tried it.) ....but saw this advertised for much less of an expense. I decided to try it and figured for the price, I couldn&#x27;t go wrong no matter what. No, I don&#x27;t use this on a regular basis (maybe I should), but when I do use it....it&#x27;s pretty amazing! My face looks so much more refreshed and glowing. Pores appear smaller and fine lines are less noticeable. Skin looks and feels firmer. My friends always tell me that my skin looks great! I especially like to use this before going out to a special occassion. I think it definitely can make you look more radiant. The smallest tube is equivalent to the Dermawand and delivers the same \\&quot;zap\\&quot; when set at a higher level.  I read other reviews that talked about the metal base detaching. I haven&#x27;t had any problems. I&#x27;m really careful about using the foam layer ( the protective covering over the tubes in the box) to hold around the base of the glass tubes when twisting into the wand. I use the same method when removing the glass tube. Twist in....twist out. Also referred to as \\&quot;righty tighty, lefty loosey\\&quot;. If everything is handled gently, you won&#x27;t have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;I use argon oil or olive oil on my skin as the conductor. Both are amazing moisturizers and  great for your skin. Definitely start at a a low level ( there are no numbers on the wand handle, but you know as soon as you turn the dial, it starts. Keep it closer to the \\&quot;off\\&quot; for low and adjust as needed.) First, I insert whichever glass tube I am using by wrapping the foam layer that comes in the box (or a dry facecloth) around the glass near the metal base and slowly twist in to the right. Once the glass tube is in, plug it in to the wall. Keep one finger on the glass tube to minimize the zap to your face. You finger will absorb the energy more. You can remove your finger once against your face. It does have a metal like odor, but not bad at all. It glows a neon orange so you know it&#x27;s working! I use long strokes from my cheek  near my nose up to the temples, from eyebrow area to top of forehead, from lower neck upward to jawline. I do each area for a couple minutes. The different attachments are fun to experiment with. The smaller the glass tube the more concentrated the energy is. When you are finished, unplug it before removing the tube. I use the same method of taking the glass tube out as putting it in except I twist it out toward the left. I wipe the tube and wand well and replace in the box. You will see a really nice glow on your face  after using! Its like a spa treatment in the privacy of your own home. Definitely worth it so much I bought it for my friend who has the Dermawand....and guess what? She likes this machine so much better!! Plus....you have all the extra attachments. You use the mushroom and spoon tubes on your arms, legs and abdomen, too. The comb is a great scalp massager, as well. I dont have thinning hair, but my head does feel revitalized afterward! The instructions are not written in perfect english, but they are still readable. I used the instructions for using on my face from the Dermawand site.  There are also a lot of instructions on you tube. It&#x27;s easy, I promise. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I think my face looks better the lines on either side of my face have improved and this lines between my eyebrows have improved and I think my jaw lines is getting better.I really helps with discoloration from my &amp;#34;old age acne&amp;#34; scars.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I gave it four stars because I can see some difference in my face after a several use.  My face looks tighter (puffiness and tired looks are drastically minimized). My pores are smaller. After use my face looks polished.  I also use it on my sister&#x27;s face and she could not believe the difference it made after one use. She called me the following morning after I used it on her face and told me that her face felt soft and smooth.  I use it at least 5 times a week. It is unfortunate that the instructions fail to inform user on what each piece is suppose to do, so I am just using common sense to figure it out. When I received the package the comb was broken, I informed seller of this and was surprised at the efficiency at which they worked at correcting the matter.  I received the new comb last Friday (12/21/2012) after which I received an email with instructions on how to return the damaged comb (I don&#x27;t know why I needed to return the damaged item at my expense) It was good that I did  not follow my initial instinct to throw it out.  I would recommend this product to friends and family, even male friends of my could benefit from it I think.</li>
    <li> A lot of people purchase these devices for cosmetic purposes.  I however, purchased it to use as an electro shock play implement to use in BDSM/kink play.  Several people have bought this product as a less expensive and make shift \\&quot;violet wand\\&quot;.  Most Violet wands can run any where from $300.00-$1200.00.  The more pricey models coming from custom designers and makers, are the ones that are more rare and seem to be often sought by those who have a serious need, desire or kink to fulfill.  I have played with several different models, from cheap to the expensive custom products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Things I found most appealing about this device: \\&quot;Pros\\&quot; This item does have the fun red/violet glow and electric shock/spark that can be seen. Especially when playing at night or in a room with a black light the color and electric current  is strong and doesn&#x27;t flicker out.  Most people that have the desire to play with a violet want for the first time love the unique sensation, sound, color and even ionizing smell in the air.  It sends a nice mild to medium shock and impulse through the skin and muscle tissue and can be an erotic and tantalizing sensation.  It isn&#x27;t as difficult to use as the more expensive Violet Wands and is at par with the models that I&#x27;ve seen and played with that cost close to $200-$300.  It isn&#x27;t an amazing kink product, but it definitely is good for those that would like to enjoy a first time experience with the violet wand.  A decent/Good product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I would&#x27;t purchase this if you are looking for a serious shock or jolt in your Electro-play.  The highest setting is the most used setting and is quite tolerable on the most sensitive areas of the body. If you are looking for first time fun, sure this will work..if you need more limits pushed, seek something from a reputable custom made design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  These really have no other use in my opinion, as these where originally invented as a \\&quot;cure all\\&quot; in the early 20th century, and have no actual health benefit other then maybe cleaning the skin of bacteria. I was actually surprised to see how many people think they have any sort of benefit to their youth, hair, health  or whatever... talk about the placebo effect.e no actual health benefit other then maybe cleaning the skin of bacteria. I was actually surprised to see how many people think they have any sort of benefit to their youth, hair, health  or whatever... talk about the placebo effect.</li>
    <li> This is actually growing back the hair on my head. After using the comb attachment I apply some Shen Min hair oil and I now have a layer of baby hair growing! It&#x27;s only been 3 weeks of use. Three times a week.  I love the fresh smell of ozone. Nikola Tesla was brilliant.</li>
    <li> I received my product a week ago and was a bit cautious as I have never used anything like this before. I read the instructions and also went online to read as much as I could, it was pretty easy to use, I didnt need to be a rocket scientist to work it out. I sit in front of the television at night after work and use the machine, I have seen results already, my skin is so much smoother, and has started to tighten and just looks great !! I am extrememly happy with this little machine.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moIZ3FOP756QT1]]i love it. this device works just as well as the \\&quot;derma wand\\&quot; and way less $. all the different size glass electrode tubes fit nice and securely into the hand piece. it really works great. plz watch my video review. excuse my editing skills, its my 1st time. hope u find it helpful.</li>
    <li> Came w a broken tip, return was speedy, spoke w amazon agent re a nee order instead f a replacement and was assured of a n xpedited shippn but never came xpedited but took too long. Cud not see effect as promised....mebbe in conjunction ed a microdermabrasion but havent got time for both for now no stickin wd the microdermabrasion.</li>
    <li> Just like everyone else, I found the directions a joke.  I used it religiously for about a week and saw no difference in my pore size or wrinkles.  I used hylaruonic acid gel to help it glide on my skin.  The only thing I noticed was that any pimples healed much faster.  I really wish there were directions in well written English on how to use the thing properly.</li>
    <li> I received my product and it came early.  I was so excited to open it.  As soon as I did I realized I had someone&#x27;s return or worse yet someones old return.  It looks at least a year old with stains on the wand and the box is crushed and soiled with a few scratches.  Gross!  I won&#x27;t be using it and will return it pronto.  Remember...you get what you pay for and some of the 5 stars type in broken english so who do you think is behind that?  Fooled once, shame on them- fool me twice, shame on me.  RETURN to sender?  Wonder how much that&#x27;s going to cost?</li>
    <li> This is more of a skin stimulator</li>
    <li> Glass mushroom end of tube fell off. Cheap</li>
    <li> this is a great product and economically a better alternative than a plastic surgeon or dermatologist. This product wakes up the collagen.......</li>
    <li> Took a month to get my order whhich was disappointing.  They need to work on that. I love the item. Does what it says.</li>
    <li> Love the high frequency treatment. At 1/2 the price at other sites. Using it daily and have&lt;br /&gt;seen changes in the skin.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical; however, I read the reviews and thought why not. I received in 3 days of ordering and used this right away. I carefully read the instructions and then tried this product out. After first use I immediately noticed some dark spots I had, appear darker in appearance. This is exactly what I wanted from this product knowing that this is the pigments being broken up and then will scab off. I had laser done several years ago on some spots and noticed the same outcome, the only difference is that I didn&#x27;t pay $ 600.00 for the service. The only recommendation I have is to wear and continuously wear sunblock to keep new and old spots from returning and your treatment will be successful.</li>
    <li> I bougth the D&#x27;arsonval High frequency direct for home one mothn ago and is already damage. The mushroom attachment broke, leaving the metal part inside the device.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to know how to cantact the company and see if they will replace the machine.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claudia</li>
    <li> This thing is SO much fun.  I was absolutely TERRIFIED of it when I read the CRAZY text on the cover of the box.  But then I re-read all the reviews, watched the d.e.r.m.a.w.a.n.d. instructional video on YouTube, had my husband (an electrical engineer) check it out, held my breath, and tried it.  Here&#x27;s the lowdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It&#x27;s weird;&lt;br /&gt;2.  It&#x27;s fun;&lt;br /&gt;3.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all (if you use the widest glass tip);&lt;br /&gt;4.  It warms up after a while;&lt;br /&gt;5.  It&#x27;s soothing;&lt;br /&gt;6.  The ozone smells like wonderful  fresh air, and although I realize there is controversy over whether we want to be breathing it, I&#x27;m taking the risk);&lt;br /&gt;7.  It works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My jawline tightened up considerably, and almost immediately, after starting to use this.  I&#x27;m 55 years-old, and haven&#x27;t taken good care of my skin in years.  It was time, so I did some research, bought a skin care regimine, and use this in conjunction with it.  I didn&#x27;t and don&#x27;t expect miracles, and so I&#x27;m really happy with this product.  I&#x27;m also frugal, so the pricetag was a big part of the appeal for me.</li>
    <li> it was super fast delivery and it worked great on my skin so far and  i will see</li>
    <li> I love it I use it a lot on my hands as well, I could see the difference in two days.</li>
    <li> I liked the tingling sensation but when I switched attachments, the bottom of the wand melted into the socket, so I sent it back</li>
    <li> I AM PLEASED WITH THIS. IT TAKES THE PUFFINESS AWAY FROM UNDER MY EYES, AND PERKS UP MY OLD TIERED FACE. IT ALSO HAS HELPED WT MY ACNE ( FROM MENOPAUSE) . I HAVEN&#x27;T HAD IT VERY LONG SO I CAN&#x27;T SAY ANY THING ON HOW IT HELPS WT WRINKLES . OVER ALL SO FAR SO GOOD, AND AT A GREAT PRICE</li>
    <li> It does make skin tighter. Awesome lil gagdet. Gotta use it daily for 5- 10 min for results. Or don&#x27;t buy one. I use it first thing in the morning before shower.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a number of weeks, at least three times a week and it hasn&#x27;t made any difference in my skin.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> First, let me say I loved the way my skin felt while using it and it made my skin rosy.  I also loved the clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the first night I used it in the upstairs bathroom next to the office where my computer is.  My husband was at the computer and told me to stop because the computer was going crazy.  He told me to use it in the downstairs bathroom from then on.  The next night I used the downstairs bathroom which sits between the kitchen and our bedroom, both with overhead fans that are programmable and have electronics in them.  The fan and the lights kept going on and off while I used it.  Then he told me to completely shut down the fans before I used it.  I did that for a few nights then in the middle of the night the fans both went on at the highest speed and I wasn&#x27;t using the unit at the time. I felt like I was in a hurricane.  I am very wary of using this again.  I&#x27;m really afraid something in the house will short out and start a fire.</li>
    <li> I noticed results right away. Decrease in wrinkles, tightening of sagging skin and reduction in pore size. And the price is amazing.</li>
    <li> Good price and videos are online for good instructions on use.  Better than the prices they charge in salons for the same thing, I am told.</li>
    <li> Sorry I cannot give a good review because I haven&#x27;t used it yet. I have high blood pressure and am working on lowering it to use this machine. Thank you very much</li>
    <li> I remember getting facials in the past and the doctor using this &amp;#34;magic wand&amp;#34;. I believe in &#x27;No pain &#x3D; No gain&#x27; so feeling the little tingling shock on my problem areas really gave me a sense that it was working. I remember the swelling always going down and breakouts diminishing so I am excited to try this at home and hope for visible results. It isn&#x27;t professional quality but what can I expect for this price? You get what you pay but my tight budget and I hope it works!</li>
    <li> It seems to work but I cannot be sure, I will update after three months</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results as of today.  Would have been better off to have saved for a procedure in a medical office.</li>
    <li> This wand puts out about one third of the power of similar units and after about three weeks of daily use the socket that holds the electrodes came loose from the attaching rivet causing the electrode to wobble around. I threw it in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone for any reason.</li>
    <li> ok if your thinking about laser treatment get ths its a great piece for the bathroom ez ez to use its like the best item in my bathroom I use 2daily and honestly it works wonders but you don&#x27;t really see till 2weeks or 10times but your friends will see and honestly that makes a huge difference and once I seen man I love this device</li>
    <li> Awesome product for the price! Great for eczema too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve lost over 100 lbs; I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything short of a facelift that can help me at this point. I&#x27;m sure this would do well on a person with a more normal weight history.</li>
    <li> I purchased this device, as everyone else has, based on mixed reviews, but mainly positive. So, I purchased it 6 months ago started using it 10mns a day every day after watching the video on the correct procedure on Youtube.  First few days, my skin became very dry and looked like parchment. Since I had had laser resurfacing sessions locally (to the tune of $350.00 a session and they recommend 5), I was aware of the dryness. Now, after 6 months the machine has lost its strength which means the red ray is no longer there so I a m not sure it is truly working. I am beginning to be very doubtful this is the machine for me. I hate to admit it.  I will probably put my face in the hands of a professional dermatologist and pay the price!!! Bottom line: this is not a machine for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend??? NO.</li>
    <li> excellent price, good results</li>
    <li> This item is large and odd, and slightly freakish. It smells weird when you use it, and I really do not see or feel any of the &amp;#34;twitching&amp;#34; that I have felt with other products of this nature used at salons. The attachments are also very hard to insert and remove from the handle - and since they are glass, it even seems a little dangerous. I will be returning.</li>
    <li> I keep trying it . when i use it  it does make my skin look better but I am inconstant</li>
    <li> OMG... i really love how this makes my skin look and feel. my skin is so bright, it looks like i have light bulbs under there lol. it does the job just as well as the unit at the spa. i had a huge zit on my face and another one forming on my chin. the next day after zapping them, the big zit was so small, you couldn&#x27;t even see it and the one on my chin never grew out. i&#x27;ve been using it for 2 fays now and i already see a major difference :-).</li>
    <li> Great product, now if we could just be disciplined enough to use it DAILY!  lol</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife after she raved to me about the DermaWand product line she saw demo&#x27;d on the Home Shopping Network (HSN). I read a couple reviews on the DermaWand and it sounded like way too much money for not much results. I did some research and found that the DermaWand technology was available for much less, and that&#x27;s how I came across the D&#x27;arsonval beauty kit. My wife loves it! And she and I both really see a difference in the quality, texture, and appearance of her face. It really does make you look younger and more vibrant with proper use. Some of the directions were a little oddly written (I guess because it&#x27;s from some European distributor) but I didn&#x27;t feel that was enough to place this at a 4-star rating. Bottom line: It works and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than similar products out there!</li>
    <li> the product is easy to use but it gives me a head ache.  i researched on line and with this type of device a head ache can be a side effect and recommends discontinuing use.  I tried just using on my lower face but this still resulted in a head ache which lasted several hours to a day.</li>
    <li> I have used the machine a few times and so far I like the results. I would need to use it a few more times in order to give a better review.</li>
    <li> Second time using it,The metal head  of one of the flat, round prong came off inside the base. I managed to get it out with tweezers. I use the others and that hasn&#x27;t happened,yet. It truly has made a difference with my skin!. J.J. from Texas</li>
    <li> This is really for dark spots.  I took a before and after pic of my hands and there was quite a difference.  Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong the directions were very very vague, I read reviews for this for wrinkles too but it seems to help dark spots/freckles best.  Good price nevertheless.</li>
    <li> Been using it a few years . however  I  dont see much difference in my skin except  its smoother.</li>
    <li> No Notice of difference</li>
    <li> After using for several months I can say that it is an excellent product to be used as treatment for facial lifting, I recommend the product and seller. Thank you</li>
    <li> The product is good, does what it is said to do. The plug is not very comfortable, and adapter is needed.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed Esthetician and this was my very first at home high frequency machine I have purchased and I have to say,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is IDENTICAL to the one I have used in spas before. And it&#x27;s sooo affordable! It even comes with a warranty certificate which just proves that it is a company that cares about their customers. Very happy. Try it out!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Great for minimizing pores and disinfecting face after facial and body after waxing... Prevents small infections and ingrown hairs...</li>
    <li> This is a short two part review. The actual product is pretty cool.  I had a pretty gnarly allergic reaction to an epoxy resin that gave me huge blisters on my face and neck... They were so bad that they left about 5 quarter sized scars on my chew, jaw, and neck and about a dozen smaller ones  spread around my face. I&#x27;ve been using this tool for about two weeks with pure olive oil and all the smaller ones are hardly detectable and the larger ones are maybe 80% gone and changed color  from deep purple and brown pits  in my skin  to  skin toned with just a slight change in color and the pitted pock marks have actually filled in. Basically I&#x27;m saying this thing works wonders. I still in disbelief... Where two weeks ago I was&lt;br /&gt;Breaking appointments because I was so self conscious to now where I&#x27;m walking up to the hottest chick in the room and starting up a conversation with my old confidence I had lost from this 3 month ordeal.... Better results than k ever imagined!&lt;br /&gt;The only slightest down side only lasted for a minute when my package arrived.&lt;br /&gt;So this brings me to the second part of the review.&lt;br /&gt;When my package arrived... All the contents had been jolted out of the little books that are supposed to keep them safe.. The smallest glass &amp;#34;wand&amp;#34; as I like to call them was broken during shipment.. So I emailed the company and  explained the situation.  I may have not been clear with them in the fact that I didn&#x27;t want a refund, but simply the broken wand replaced. Wifhin hours they kindly responded back and told me they were giving a full refund... I emailed them back and explained how I meant to be more clear that I wanted to keep their product and not return it. I then asked if I should return what they sent me and then buy a new one with the money they returned (shipping included BTW). MHD apologized again and told me I was welcome to keep the one already sent and the refund...so I got a full refund, AND got to keep the one they sent which was just missing 1 of the 4 attachments....&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been working so well with all the other attachments that I did just keep it.  Basically I got it for free.  How often does that happen.. ? Never. That&#x27;s how often. This company aside from selling a very useful product, has an unbelievable business ethic, and treated me much better than any other business than I can ever remember....I will for sure be back to try their other products, and have and will continue to recommend this product and company  to family and friend. What a great experience... More than fair and I can&#x27;t thank them enough,... I hope this helps.... I&#x27;m off to write another review on the exact opposite experience from another company that sent me the wrong thing and instead of giving a refund they are actually trying to get me to buy additional components  to make this wrong product work..... Anyways.... These guys are great and the only thing that might be better is the Results I&#x27;ve already gotten from the product!  Thanks again!</li>
    <li> Well all the reviews I read about the instructions being impossible to understand were correct.They were comical. But I went on line and used the directions for the Derma Wand. I did not get any product to use with it, like some said they did but I just used my regular face lotion. I just got this today and used it twice. The wrinkles, or little bit of saggy skin I had on my chest, are gone. My skin is soft and smooth. I have jowls, baggy eyelid, and some lines around my mouth I am working on. I am thinking this is gonna work. I will write another review in a week or so. (day two) Having thought more about this, it&#x27;s common knowledge that at my age 61, once skin is stretched it does not bounce back. Some of the ways to use this involve a lot of skin stretching, especially around the eye area. Now, it looks great at time of doing it, but next morning all wrinkles were back in eye area with it seems to a me a few more. Ok I only used it one day, but I have decided to just roll it all over my face even upper eye for a few weeks with NO stretching of the skin just to see what it does. I feel like once you start stretching the skin you will HAVE to use this forever. I also recommend being hydrated when using it as enough water fills in some of our fine lines and there won&#x27;t be as much need for all the stretching. Any comments on this I would love to hear!( Going back to some facial exercises also)</li>
    <li> Works great instructionsate horrible if you do not know how to use one.</li>
    <li> I like this product- my only complaint is that the power units burn out after 10hrs of use. Working on my fifth unit in 7 months&#x27;</li>
    <li> Never buy generic, I was trying to get the cheaper version of Silk&#x27;n FaceFX... NOT</li>
    <li> Works great. I just need to find the time to use it. I wish it was a little smaller so I could tote it places.</li>
    <li> Does not work as advertised. Should have returned  it after one use.</li>
    <li> I have had this for about a week. Not seeing a change on my face yet. I have been using it on my hands to and they are looking pretty! Yay!</li>
    <li> Beautiful divice ! Good for skin!</li>
    <li> The delivery was very fast. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it isn&#x27;t as strong as one in the 8 in 1 machine.</li>
    <li> Definitely a very interesting product! It takes a lot of time and repeated sessions to see visible results for wrinkles but it also diminished dark spots on my face (which is not even something i was too concerned with), it also shrunk a small skin growth i had on my neck as a secondary result. My sister purchased one because it caused her acne to VANISH after two uses.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work no result&lt;br /&gt;Tomona Blanding</li>
    <li> This actually works.  I have used it for brown spots on my face, and it&#x27;s removed them.  It doesn&#x27;t happen all at once, but if you use it regularly, it will.  Great value, too; compare it to other similar products to see what a bargain this is.</li>
    <li> The D&#x27;arsonval HF for home use arrived weeks before etimated delivery - Kudos to the seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in great condition and everything has worked perfectly.  The only downside are the directions that appear on the box and the enclosed pamphlet.  As mentioned by other reviewers, they are unclear and very oddly-worded. I still give it a 5 because of the quality for such a low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with it so far and it&#x27;s kind of fun to use, actually. After 1 week of use, there seems to be slight improvement in my skin&#x27;s appearance. My pores appear to be smaller and ever so slight tightening in my skin. No reduction yet on age spots; hopefully, those will disappear with more use over time!</li>
    <li> I have not yet tried the device. It appears to be as expected. I viewed instructions on assembly on You Tube.  This is helpful. The printed instructions included are very hard to understand.</li>
    <li> When the machine arrived I opened it felt concerned when the box was crushed. Opened it and saw the wand had to be screwed into the base of the handle and there was no way to  screw the wands in. There were no attatchments. I worked in the beauty business and thought this was too good to be true(the price)You get what you pay for. Don&#x27;t understand the positive reviews maybe they got a different machine? Guess I will have to eat the loss.</li>
    <li> Good, received on time</li>
    <li> The item arrived about 2 weeks after I ordered it, which was earlier than the ETA provided. I started using it right away, it seems to be pretty similar to the one my cosmetologist uses, at least by the way it feels on my skin. I usually use it over my mask. I have been using it for a few weeks and so far I like it: easy to use, exactly as described and for this money is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Has worked pretty well so far.</li>
    <li> This device seemed to be doing good things for my skin - felt all nice and tingly, plus my acne cleared up nicely.  Then, during my second week of use, one of the glass tubes broke off from the base while I was using it (meaning that the metal part is now stuck in the unit).  I am probably going to try to find a better quality unit because I would still like to give high frequency a shot.</li>
    <li> this is a good product but the encasing was cracked on it when i got it so it missfires and dont expect kelly tech to back their product...CUZ THEY DONT...BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK</li>
    <li> I noticed after about 4 weeks of use my skin appeared smoother and more clear. I did not notice much on the back of my hands though.&lt;br /&gt;I also used this on a nail fungus it worked great, the nail is completely normal now after 4 weeks.</li>
    <li> great product is helping with swelling under my eyes and giving my skin an over all better look</li>
    <li> came on time but really didn&#x27;t seem to do anything after at least 4 weeks</li>
    <li> It provides the humming sound, the lightning, so you know at least it is doing something. I don&#x27;t know if it works or not as claimed. I have been using it for a week. Do not see any improvement yet. Will continue to use it for a while longer</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin...wasn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
    <li> When I got this, I started to use it immediately. I did feel electrical currents as I was putting the device up to my face, but once it made contact with my skin, I no longer felt the shock.  Since I did not know how to use it and the directions were unclear, I had to return it. I should have followed the other reviewers advice on watching Youtube videos to learn how to use it. I may purchase it again.  The reason I gave it 5 stars is because customer service was great. They responded to my emails right away. I didn&#x27;t even  have to pay for shipping. They also refunded my money 100% right away, so no headaches for me. Although the machine didn&#x27;t work out for me, I trust this vendor and will purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> I like how this makes my face feel after using it.  The instructions are really bad so I ended up going to a facial spa place and they were nice enough to show me how to use it (youtube didn&#x27;t have very good videos).  My only complaint was that it didn&#x27;t say in the description if it was the red or the blue light.  It ended up being the red light which is ok.  I am just going to buy a blue accessory for my acne.</li>
    <li> I use this but other than a cool zap I don&#x27;t really see any changes.  Maybe more time is required</li>
    <li> it has a lot of power. shipped really fast.</li>
    <li> Like this product, shipment was received 1 week ahead of estimated schedule.  A little piece one was broken after my first use.  I contacted seller, and received a replacement without any problem.  I enjoy using this product while watching TV, and I can see the shine on my face after a couple of weeks of massaging on my face.  I recomend this product!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item and tried it out right away. It comes with a variety of attachments which function in varying degrees. I do like this item, but the two things I do not like about it is that it is LOUD and the smell of argon gas is evident when in use. Not sure if this is normal. Aside from that it does give you a good shock and that feels good. If you can&#x27;t handle the pain you can easily adjust the dial. Use it for an extended period of time and your skin will get red, but hey thats the price we pay to look fabulous. This is a good alternative to other popular models.</li>
    <li> Good for roseca and reducing pores. Lines under eyes are reduced overall a good experience and would recommend to family and friends</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the product and I can&#x27;t wait to start using it on myself so I can see how it works.  Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Great product, works just as well as the much more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> deliver was quicker that it was planed.&lt;br /&gt;Nice to have at home, perfect for skin care. dont forget read instrustion before use it :)&lt;br /&gt;Best regards Jekaterina</li>
    <li> I bought this rf product because of the price.  I  figured if it works at all, I would buy a \\&quot;real\\&quot; one.  Now I don&#x27;t think I need anything else.  After one use with the mushroom head at almost full strength, there is a definite difference in the appearance of my skin.  It is just more even - like I am wearing foundation, but I&#x27;m not. I am so excited to do the off skin method with a narrow attachment  for wrinkles. Even if that doesn&#x27;t work the machine has has already been worth the price.</li>
    <li> Fun, I&#x27;m not sure it is working, but it is interesting!</li>
    <li> I have only used this machine 3 times and already see a difference, my face is so clear now, and the fine lines are already fading. I&#x27;m can&#x27;t wait to see more results!</li>
    <li> When I wrote the company about the device not working after 7.5 months of light use, they chose to blame me. Also, their \\&quot;very\\&quot; limited warranty is 6 mo, and since they blame me, they would not cover it anyway. This is the second problem I have had with this unit, see below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is how Beauty Essence claims I ruined my device:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I am really sorry that the item does not function properly. The item comes with a 6 months limited warranty. From your description, it seems that the cord of the unit must have be improperly pulled when unplugged from the wall outlet.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never plugged the device into a wall outlet. I have a 45 year old vacuum cleaner cord I have plugged and unplugged at least 8 times a week, going from room to room, its cord is still fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the product is great when it works (see original review below) I have had trouble twice, first: an electrode broke off leaving the metal part inside the device, I managed to remove the metal part, and the electrode was replaced but took several emails and two weeks just for an answer. Every other seller has replied within hours when I report a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after 7.5 months of light use, the device has completely stopped working. I have written Beauty Essence several times for over a week, and not received a reply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WAS thrilled with this product while it was working, but 7.5 months of light use is not great. I broke my shoulder and could not use the device much for several months. Still waiting for response from Beauty Essence&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incredible High Frequency product. I chose the one with 4 different shaped electrodes. They are neon electrodes which produce  ozone. I have also purchased electrodes for this product which emit argon that help with acne. Three argon electrodes of 3 different shapes, were only $18.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so much more efficient to use the larger surface of the \\&quot;mushroom\\&quot; shaped electrode on my purchase above. There isalso a comb that has already made my hair thicker and nearly ended hair loss I was experiencing in less than one week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has improved my puffy eyes, it has plumped my skin, and improved its texture. I just received the argon electrodes and will be reviewing their performance in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my best purchases ever, thrilled with this product, when it works, of course. Not thrilled with the company. In fact, disgusted by them for not standing up for their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint was originally routed by Amazon to Project E Beauty instead of Beauty Essence. Project E Beauty responded within hours, and could not have been more eager to replace the device. They wrote me 3 times arranging to send a replacement before they realized Beauty Essence was, in fact, responsible. Project E Beauty has a solid year warranty on their device and electrodes. Not a limited 6 month warranty and no speculating on how I may have damaged the cord.</li>
    <li> The instructions are not good at all.  as other reviewers have mentioned, there are considerable typos in the booklet.  It doesn&#x27;t give good instructions at all.  That tells me, the devise must not be good enough to get some good instructions to the users, some picture examples, troubleshooting, etc.</li>
    <li> Works great. I was paying $150.00 per session with my dermatologist. I have been using D&#x27;arasonval for months now and my sister noticed the difference after not seeing me for  3 months.  I recommend this over derama wand anytime. This really works on my rosaea. Also reduces wrinkles and age spots. I am very light skinned and the redness really showed. I love my D&#x27;arsonval.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Months later and still getting comments on how good my skin looks. Still works fine. I still love the D&#x27;arsonval!!!!!Yes ladies you have to USE it to see results!!!!</li>
    <li> It does what it says.</li>
    <li> Love this received this in a few days</li>
    <li> I am a licensed Esthetician and this HF device was recommended to me by another Esthie friend of mine who works from home. She said it gets the job done and used it on me, so I figured why not purchase one myself. So far so good. The pieces are easy to insert into the device and the instructions are clear enough for a layman to understand.</li>
    <li> Worked for about 60 days, with once a week use, however, has stopped working. Contacted the seller.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after much research, in the hopes of tightening up loose sagging skin on my face.  I&#x27;ve been using it now 1 - 2 times daily for 1 week, and what I can tell you from my experience is that it does produce some very subtle results.  BUT... (&amp; what NOBODY ELSE has mentioned in ANY other reviews I read), is that the results are TEMPORARY.  I could tell a slight difference in the tightness of my face, especially around the jawline &amp; on my forehead within minutes of using it.  But that only lasts a few hours.  I guess you have to use it 2-3 times a day to maintain.  But that seems to me that it could be harmful to use it that much.  I&#x27;ve yet to find any definitive answer on recommended usage. Various websites say anywhere from 2 x/day to once a week.  Does it help acne?  I can&#x27;t say.  But it does seem to dry your face out some.  That, too, is only slightly.  I&#x27;ve read that it must be used at the high test setting to achieve maximum results, but anything past about 3/4 stings too much for me.  So, I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s \\&quot;junk\\&quot; as one reviewer stated,  but it&#x27;s not everything they say it is either</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this unless you know how to use it! I read the instructions just for fun and there a mess. Great product though if you are trained on how to use it</li>
    <li> I wont lie to you and claim it can stop or reverse wrinkles. That wont happen, genetics are genetics and nothing for at home use can change that. Acne? possibly. or it could be the sanitizing the face before and after its use, not quite sure where the credit lays there. i can however say it has helped my hands and feet regain color. they have been blue for some time. it isn&#x27;t circulation causing blue digits so the machine isn&#x27;t improving the circulation. i&#x27;m not sure what exactly its doing other than stimulating nerve endings in the surface layer of the skin but that appears to be enough, my dermatologist suggest i use it 3 x a week now as my hands which have been hydroquinoned, poked and prodded yet stayed blue are now somewhere between a normal flesh color and barely bruised appearance despite having been a deep dark bluish purple for over 6 months in what looked like severe frostbite. the smell i could do without but thats a small price to pay  to be able to wear sandals again.</li>
    <li> Follow the instructions.  You can even view a You Tube video on how to do the technique properly, but I recommend this product.  You will see the difference in your skin.  My skin looks great.</li>
    <li> We have the same portable high frequency device at school and i just love it! I bought it for the hair comb and use it every night and it gets rid of all of my headaches and its super easy to use. I got it super fast too!</li>
    <li> I have a different model of this technology which is small and easily carried when traveling.  This one is huge and distubingly looks like a &amp;#34;vibrator&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;d be mortified if someone found it in my bathroom cabinet.  The instructions, while in English, are obviously translated from Chinese, leaving me with questions as to exactly how to use the different attachments.  I like the price and I do use it but I&#x27;m not sure I would recommend it over a more compact version.</li>
    <li> It does pack the punch of a smaller two-pronged unit that I&#x27;ve been using, so I haven&#x27;t seen results happen as quickly as with the Micro-current Eye Zone Massager.  Your skin really needs to turn redder to get to the deeper layers to speed cell turn-over.</li>
    <li> I LIKE IT. MAKES MY FACE FEEL REALLY GOOD AND REFRESHED BUT I DONT SEE ANY TIGHTENING OF THE SKIN YET. I DO NOTICE NO MORE BREAKOUTS WHICH IS A PLUS!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t actually do anything, but can burn you occasionally. But then... did anyone really expect it to?</li>
    <li> Other than looking like a cool prop from a 1960&#x27;s SciFi film, this really does nothing...</li>
    <li> I used the product for about 2 days before the spoon tool seperated from the metallic end and had to be removed from the unit with pliers.  I see no results on the brown spots which is why I bought the product.</li>
    <li> I would love to give a good review of this product, but that is not possible. I inserted the glass comb into the handheld part of the unit and it broke. The glass tube portion separated from the metal base. Whatever glue is used to hold the two pieces together didn&#x27;t. I hope no one else has this problem. I did. I so very much wanted this product to work, but alas, I will never know. I never got a chance to even try it once. I am upset. I just hope I can get my money back. I would be willing to try another set if they were willing to ship me a new one for free. I really do want to try it and see if this type of product actually works or not.</li>
    <li> This high frequency machine has the same power and intensity of the full machines I&#x27;ve used in the past. It&#x27;s light enough for me to take on my travels too. The result is tighter pores and far fewer break outs.</li>
    <li> I like this, feels great when you do it, but haven&#x27;t seen real results.</li>
    <li> This item is not worth the money. It broke in less than two weeks. Without me using it every day. Waiting for my refund</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t started using it yet.  They should have put the precautions in the description of their product here instead of me finding out when I received the item.  Second, This says here it&#x27;s a skin tightener and takes cares of wrinkles and fine lines and puffy eyes but on the front of my box it says spot remover.  You can&#x27;t eat anything dark according to the instructions on the front of the box but I eat dark salads so what does that mean for me?.  Oh and you can&#x27;t wet the area for 22 hours so it&#x27;s not like you can wash yourself twice a day.  I&#x27;m looking for this item to tighten and take care of wrinkles...wasn&#x27;t looking for a spot remover.  Now I&#x27;m a little nervous to even open the box.  Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated. I hate not knowing things aforehand.</li>
    <li> If you can get past the absolutely horrible English on the packaging, and then get past the incomplete instructions, and then get past the fact that all this does is generate a little circulation, then this is the product  for you!</li>
    <li> I bought this device a year ago.  I used it a couple of times a week and it seemed to work pretty well for temporary skin tightening and it worked really well on making pimples go away quicker.  In the past few weeks I noticed the electrodes weren&#x27;t working very well anymore, as if maybe they weren&#x27;t making good contact with the inside of the electric wand.  I had inserted the electrode with the smallest tip and since it wasn&#x27;t working right I tried carefully re-inserting it into the device.  The glass electrode suddenly snapped and the broken glass went slicing all the way through the base of my left index finger just like it was butter!  I even felt the neon gas escape into my finger!  I mean this thing cut all the way through my finger and came out the other side, cutting an artery in the process!  Blood was gushing out with every heart beat and I had to be rushed to the hospital for stitches to repair this very severe injury!  So I now have a severed artery and nerve damage to my finger and it hurts VERY, VERY BADLY!!!  I haven&#x27;t gotten the hospital bill yet, but I&#x27;m sure of one thing, it&#x27;s not going to be cheap. This D&#x27;arsonval is a dangerous device and is not worth the risk of severe injury from the glass electrode breaking off and impaling you or cutting you or even electrocuting you if an electrode breaks while you are using it!  The electrodes are not made of tempered glass, they are very fragile and break very easily, with jagged, razor-sharp edges. The benefit is definitely NOT worth the risk! I don&#x27;t recommend anyone buy this item.</li>
    <li> This is an invigorating tool for the skin and hair.  I wish I had more time to use it.</li>
    <li> I liked this until my bulb broke I just threw the whole unit away because the bottom part of the bulb was still lodged in the unit :(</li>
    <li> Good product, fast delivery.  A+</li>
    <li> very powerful, great price, very high quality, this product is well thought out, and is easy to use</li>
    <li> I recieved the box packed with other items I had ordered from Amazon.com. The Portable High Frequency LZ-006A instrument and the glass tube were in fine shape. It came in a blue box with no name anywhere on it. It occured to me this may not be what I ordered since NO WHERE on the box, the instrument, or the instruction mannual does it have the name D&#x27;Arsonval on it.  I tried it out after trying to decipher the pamphlet that came with it, which apparently was interpreted by a person who speaks English as a second or third language. For instance, in the manual instructions read as follows...\\&quot;Skin with freckle and splash is unfit for this treatment\\&quot;, \\&quot;puck the glass tube out of the hand piece\\&quot;. On the front of the box,\\&quot;If spot are not to remover during one usage; does not use again until the scab falls off.\\&quot; WTF??&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I cleaned my face, steamed, and then applied a cream. I tried out all the attachments(the comb tube, the tongue tube, bend tube, and mushroom tube)and they all worked, although, I had no idea what each piece was to be used for or how to properly use each piece, since no where on the box or in the mannual does it explain how to use this device other than \\&quot;Please make sure that install the glass tube into the hand piece before turning on machine\\&quot;. I came back onto Amazon.com to compare the pictures of the item I ordered to the item I recieved and the instrument and glass tubes look the same as what I recieved, except the name D&#x27;Arsonval appears on the inside of the box lid in the picture. That&#x27;s not what I got. Oh, and it&#x27;s Not UL approved either. I hope I don&#x27;t regret this purchase, but only time will tell. My skin looks nice after my first treatment, so so far, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Instructions were a little vague. Had to go on web to read other people comments and tips.</li>
    <li> I used to be a cosmetologist, we used this in our salons. I love the feel while and after I use it. I have sensitive skin and no problems cause you control the level of what you can handle. It&#x27;s helps my skin not just my face but you can use it where ever you have issues.</li>
    <li> I have dad this devise for 15 days now and it work great with the exception that on maximum the power breaks down some times but other than that I consider for a home product it is very good and I will recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> I am very much enjoying my purchase. I am doing facials and scalp manuipulations on a regular basis. My daughter and grand daughters are very excited about the results. My husband gets facials and scalp manipulations as well.</li>
    <li> Had a small sore on face.  It was completely cleared in 3 days.  Love this.  Will continue use for wrinkles.</li>
    <li> It was delivered on time. The directions are very hard to understand. They are not written by someone who speaks English. The cord is not UL certified as in the United States and the plug is weird not like American plugs. I am afraid when I use it that I might get shocked. Would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> There are no instructions on how to use it.I dont know what to do with it or how to return it.There was only the device in the box and thats all.No paper work not a thing.I could not find any information on it on line either.Just have to cut my losses with this one.I read similar statements when I looked for information on how to use this.I should have done my homework first.</li>
    <li> Works great! My absolute favorite esthetics machine. Menorah every penny for great results! My face is clear &amp; it helps keep it that way.</li>
    <li> This D&#x27;arsonval high frecuency is excellent. My daughter is happy  with the gift. Your work is more efective. I recomended the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> Love this little gadget!  Totally sterilizes my skin. the mushroom head good for all over face. snake top good for around eyes and nose.  zit zapper is exactly that. and comb makes my scalp tingle.  i am a licensed esthetician so i know how to use this otherwise you could electrocute yourself if not properly trained, but i love the way my skin looks. helps circulation and lymphatic drainage.</li>
    <li> I have only used this one time, I was out of town after it was delivered. I was disappointed there were not clear instructions. I will try it, and leave a review later, if there are positive results.</li>
    <li> I got my new high frequency just on time, so good as expected, I&#x27;m so glad for made this purchase ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad tried this product.  After reading another customer review i purchased it.  I also followed the recommendation to go online especially &#x27;You Tube&#x27; and research how to use the instrument.  That was extremely helpful to me and taught me about what to do what and what not to do.  What to use on my face and what not to use before,  during and after the treatment.  I love the product.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be good. I haven&#x27;t used it enough to confirm results yet but when I use it I feel my face skin softer and somehow tightened. I guess that a noticeable result takes some more time. One thing to notice is that it also helps in keeping your scalp healthy, for it comes with a comb-attachment..!.</li>
    <li> I did a great deal of research for oily acne-prone skin and this device kept popping up. So I purchased paulaschoice acne skin treatment to use with this high frequency device and I&#x27;ve noticed pore shrinkage, smoother skin and less severe breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence about purchasing this, spend the $40 bucks and watch the videos on how to use on utube; the instructions aren&#x27;t all that helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also include that I&#x27;m in my mid 40s and I have suffered from acne since puberty.  As I age, my pores have gotten larger and to top it off, those pesky little hormonal cystic pimples occasionally pop up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this high frequency device every evening after cleansing, salicyclic acid (2% and fantastic), benzoyl perioxide (5%), followed by a moisturizer-oil free, and within 15 days I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I&#x27;d like to think that this high frequency machine is doing it&#x27;s job, however, for wrinkles or hyper-pigmentation it&#x27;s only the placebo effect.  Now for a zit-zapper it is great.  Drys them right up.  So In my opinion, I would not purchase this for any other reason than for a clearer skin especially if you have acne.  I did have one of the metal bottoms come off of the glass wand, but easily glued it back on with super glue.  These machines are also about twenty bucks cheaper on e-bay, but I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t get a replacement if it fails on you like you would with Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just begun to use it and I do not have enough information yet, I need more time to study and check the results.</li>
    <li> having open blemishes use this a couple of days and it would heal quickly and helps with scaring. and it leaves a clean feeling</li>
    <li> Very helpful for plumping up fine lines and wrinkles. Helps build collagen, so skin feels so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> excellent care and products at the expected time as well as the just boxes to package size</li>
    <li> ..Awesome.... more then I expected....I have not said a word but people are saying there is a change in the last 3 weeks...I look healthier and my eyes seem to glow....... . May I also say it got here so fast I had to duck as it flew in the door.... WOW..... very pleased.... lets see how well it travels.....</li>
    <li> I have only had this a few weeks.  I have been using the hair comb since I have fine thin hair (and am a girl).  I&#x27;ve also been using the other attachments on my face and believe I can see some lightening of my sun damaged cheeks.  When the results are more dramatic I will take an after photo and post it.  I haven&#x27;t yet seen any diminishing of wrinkles, but imagine it will take more than a few weeks.</li>
    <li> words cant describe how happy I am to find this!!!! it has helped my cystic acne, dark spots, and scars tremendously!!! when nothing else would!!! i was shocked with the glow i had after the next day...even through the scatterred pimples...I could see my skin loved it!!! the pimples all began to dry up with out flaking like the strong prouducts were doing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i do this treatmeant everyday smiling in the mirror!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank u thank u thank u! please continue to bring us more of TESLA&#x27;S inventions!</li>
    <li> It needs a cream, lotion or gel in order to glide across the skin. You will have to experiment with this. It seems to work very well for zits. Used it on my daughter for a nasty one on her lip and it was diminished by the next day. It has helped with the terrible bags under my eyes and have actually gotten rid of the terrible puffy areas that make up would not cover. The dark circles aren&#x27;t as bad either. I have noticed that it helps a lot for lifting the eye area, ya know those heavy eyelids that droop more and more? ( I am 59) It is slowly working on those not so funny laugh lines and is tightening up under my chin. Have been using it semi religiously for about 3 weeks. No instant miracles, but then, aging didn&#x27;t happen overnight. I watched a couple you tube videos and went from there. Directions are a little ambiguous and not written very well. I suggest you put your cream that you usually use on first and don&#x27;t rub it in all the way. Leave it a little wet then use it.</li>
    <li> This is a great little facial gizmo. I&#x27;m so grateful to all of the people who tried it and reviewed it before I bought it. I&#x27;ve only had it for three days, but it&#x27;s already been so great for helping to clear up some blemishes. The directions are absolutely comical. A huge thank you to the people who posted information about how to best use the machine. I would&#x27;ve been scared to death had I not seen all of that customer input. Once you gather the information online, you will be ready to roll. It feels exactly like the ones estheticians use. Yay! So glad that I bought it!</li>
    <li> Takes a bit of getting use to feeling the zapping on the skin. One of the tips came off and epoxied it back.</li>
