<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really Cute great quality took a while to come but was well worth it.</li>
    <li> Super cute! Diamonds were mixed up though, not separated..</li>
    <li> No way near 1200 piece as advertised. Very disappointed. Will not order again.</li>
    <li> Lots of different styles of rhinestones.  They do not have adhesive backing so you will need to get nail glue, too.</li>
    <li> Awesome variety, I love being able to slide over to whichever ones I want and pour them out easily, mess free!</li>
    <li> for what the nail salon charges you, you can do it yourself and many many many times over. great price too</li>
    <li> A great buy, easy to get to stones and like the separation concept.  I would buy again!</li>
    <li> love working with this recommend this</li>
    <li> I got some cloudy looking gems all the same size and all circular?</li>
    <li> I love the look of my nails and toes.</li>
    <li> Definitely not 1200 pieces but I still love it for the price.</li>
    <li> Again they are not rhinestones, can hardly even see them! Very difficult to even pick one up! How can you call this prem quality?</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for nail art however unless you have good nail glue/top coat they might fall off but I didn&#x27;t have the problem.</li>
    <li> The jewels were all shaped different.  I can&#x27;t wait to do my nails and see how great they are going to look!!!</li>
    <li> Very varied and pretty</li>
    <li> the jewel are cute and last a  long time with super glue then clear polish</li>
    <li> I love this product. There are a lot of rhinestones. I love the way the rhinestones are section off so that you don&#x27;t have to search for the ones you want to use. I love the way the package arrived before expected time. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if theres 1200 crystals in this pack but for the price, the amount I got was sure well worth the price. They&#x27;re very cute too!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I&#x27;d read that some people were unhappy with the size, but these were just what I expected.  If you have a question about size, look at the pictures that show the fingernail and you&#x27;ll get an idea of the size of the individual rhinestones in context.  Mine arrived in great condition with only a tiny bit of spillover between colors.</li>
    <li> Took a little longer than I expected to receive this but it was worth the wait. I&#x27;m happy with them overall.</li>
    <li> I am going to have a blast with my nail art. Cant wait to use it on myself and my clients.</li>
    <li> This was part of my daughter&#x27;s 17th birthday present. She loves playing with nail designs, and these rhinestones are something she&#x27;s been looking for in stores for months. Not once have we seen such a comprehensive pack for so little. We&#x27;ll likely buy again!</li>
    <li> These rhinestones are adorable and come in lots of different shapes which I hadn&#x27;t even noticed from the photo! There are stars, hearts, bows, little moons, etc. They look great on my nails. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> i recieved my package early that is a plus i used some of the rhinestones last night i like them and they are very durable and i will be ordering from them again!! fast delivery great product who can ask for more!!! thank you for my early gift!!!</li>
    <li> These little thing still amaze me that I had to buy more! They work great and look amazing. I recommend getting them!</li>
    <li> Perfect condition! Lots of designs to pick from!</li>
    <li> Cute set, lots of different shapes but they are really small which for some things is necessary.  I found that when I applied a top coat the stones became very dull, not sure if your supposed to do that or not but it seemed like it would help it stay in place.  However, the freaking delivery took weeks, most of these nail decorations ship from China and I am not kidding you, I have one order that still hasn&#x27;t arrived and I ordered it a month ago.  If you got the time knock your self out but if your hoping to get your supplies within the next 7 days, don&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> can be useful on many thing other than your nails.clothen art and crafts where ever your mind takes you enjoy.</li>
    <li> all i hoped it would the  and more i  well shop with you in the future thank you so much</li>
    <li> The rhinestones aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;clean cut&amp;#34;, meaning the star has extra material on it or is missing a point for example. The rhinestones weren&#x27;t as cute as I expected and included shapes that I don&#x27;t think anyone would ever use on nails.</li>
    <li> Received sooner than the 17-28 days bud did not receive what was advertised. The item said 1,200 Jems in different shapes and I received maybe 100 Jems in 12 different shapes.</li>
    <li> I totally love this!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered these just recently and arrived 5 - 8 days prior to estimated delivery date. They&#x27;re much cuter then I thought they would be and the wheel they are separated in is very sturdy and well built. Way better quality then what you find at nail places here. Love it and will buy again. Thank you!!!! Very happy costumer</li>
    <li> Looks identical to picture! This normally runs in stores for more than $10! Love the product!!! I keep myself stocked up on it!</li>
    <li> Item was as described. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a great selection for the money. A few stones are misshaped, but for as cheap as it is that&#x27;s ok. They hold up well with clear polish, but nail glue makes then look foggy.</li>
    <li> There are not 1200 crystal , the box is too small</li>
    <li> Took awhile to get but they are nice. Lots of different shapes to choose from.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this until next month, but totally thrilled it arrived early.  Can&#x27;t wait to start creating some nail designs.</li>
    <li> Have to have sparkles. They make the nails with just solid color look fancy and professionally done.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with amount stated</li>
    <li> Fun for nails...  quick and easy</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t exactly what I thought it was. I actually expected them to be a little bigger. They are cute and the shipping time was awesome!!! It arrived way ahead of the estimated date! Thumbs up for that!</li>
    <li> I ordered these because I have ordered rhinestones in the past from different sellers and hardly ever get the amount advertised. Since it was a less advertised amount than I usually order, I hoped that there would actually be 1200, but there were not.  I got 11 different shapes, not 12. There are probably about 15-20 of most of them: flower, stars, triangles, teardrops, ovals, rectangles, small circles, and a funky shape I can&#x27;t describe. I got less than 10 of large circles, squares, and hearts. Kind of disappointed but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> First off, shipping was EXTREMELY FAST!!! I was shocked. Each of the spaces has a rhinestone of a different shape, some hearts, stars, bows, triangles, etc. - very cute and a great deal. Excellent seller!</li>
    <li> What I got was cheap an ugly never again.</li>
    <li> Super teeny tiny! I haven&#x27;t used a lot of them, but I like them. I even glued a couple to my glasses--they look quite subtle but add a hint of sparkle. They came a bit jumbled, and this style of container isn&#x27;t my favorite. But the price is right if you aren&#x27;t looking for the shine of a genuine swarovski.</li>
    <li> Ok.  These come in a smal box about the size of an old silver dollar.  It does not have alot in here.  They also get stuck to the dish.</li>
    <li> I received these today.... they are just as described.</li>
    <li> 🌟🌟🌟🌟EverMarket is Great, Their Products Are very Affordable! I Purchase several of these as gifts for the holiday season. I am very satisfied with the size of the product, how many rhinestones come in  the package. Very Shinny &amp; eye Catching. I plane on Getting More For myself this time! Did I mention the shipping was free? Yesssss! 👏</li>
    <li> I really love this!!! It is so cute and it has different shapes such as: 3 different sizes of circles, tear drops, triangles, football shaped, flowers, star, squares, hearts, rectangles, and a bean-ish shape!!! It was smaller than I thought it would be, but I am really happy I got it!!! There are tons of gems/stones and I highly recommend on getting them!!! ^^</li>
    <li> i love it .. Thank you.</li>
    <li> this was a waste of money they are so Tiny tiny, that u can&#x27;t even pick them up nor c them on ur nails,  S.I.N.Y.LADYRIDER</li>
    <li> I love these!! They look great on nails, I was very happy with the shine and sparkle they maintained. I just orderd two more of them. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I am addicted to doing my nails and love to add accessories.  These contain 100 each of 12 different shapes for less than $2.  What a bargain!  You don&#x27;t have to ration your rhinestones when you can get this many for such a reasonable price.  Bling up those nails!</li>
    <li> Nice i loved these rhinestones</li>
    <li> They are cute and easy to use. They are not too big, which makes them perfect for my tiny hands!</li>
    <li> Beautiful. Love the bling they give my nails.</li>
    <li> Love these and I use them often, thank you!</li>
    <li> Best gems I have ever used!!! Never fall off and only take a little bit of top coat to get them to stay on. I had no problem getting these off my nails. I just used some nail polish remover and they came right off. It is possible to reuse these gems after you wear them.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re all different shapes, stars, flowers, water drops, any shape you like, it&#x27;s in there. they are easy to put on the nails, you can decorate any design with them. By the way, the seller was really nice. Because after first time I ordered, it got lost, but they send me another one right away. So I was very happy with it, it was a good experience.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected and shipping was extremely slow. Later then what was given for deliver date, but for the price you cant beat it.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 because it was an awesome deal! Love it. Was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> A cute and great little case of adorable shaped rhinestones! love it, definitely what I was looking for, and the perfect price!</li>
    <li> I think these little gems are super cute. I have so many shapes to pick from its great. This pack will last forever if you&#x27;re not a pro. For personal use these are great. I am very happy with my purchase and order process. Yes I would order again! I only wish tracking info was provided.</li>
    <li> I received them today and estimated delivery wasn&#x27;t for another 3-4 weeks &amp; they&#x27;re really cute. My only problem is the picture makes it look like you&#x27;re getting way more .. other than that I&#x27;m happy with the product</li>
    <li> these are super super small and the shapes are kind of blobby. but they were super cheap!</li>
    <li> I received 1/10 of the rhinestones!!!</li>
    <li> The pieces are very tiny, but will try and use plus it didn&#x27;t cost very much.</li>
    <li> It gives a cute bling on your nails. They are very tiny good for my narrow nails! I also love the case its very handy</li>
    <li> I was very happy to receive this product. I like rhinestones and the amount is quite charming for the price of $1.20 which is what I thought I paid. However, I found that I had been charged $2.85 instead of $1.20 and free shipping. Aw...boo&lt;br /&gt;I hate it when that happens.</li>
    <li> suuuper cheap and lots of rhinestones. how can you go wrong with this deal? haha i love them for nails</li>
    <li> love them but i do not know how to make them stick to my nails properly</li>
    <li> Love all the shapes and sizes!</li>
    <li> This finally arrived and doesn&#x27;t look to have 1200 pieces. It probably has a third of that  number.  They are different shapes and sizes.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted :) Happy and would order again</li>
    <li> Love the variety of shapes and very easy to apply with the proper tools, however, loses some of its bling when covered with top coat.</li>
    <li> Really cheaop like a dollar with free shipping. you dont get alot of product but it has a nice selction. I would buy a agian if i ran out</li>
    <li> As I expected use all the tome</li>
    <li> I ordered these with the expect that they would not come very quick because I have ordered other things that are this inexpensive. That is really my only complaint. As long as you don&#x27;t mind waiting, it is a good purchase. I ordered these a week ago and they are expected in mid October. Just remember it may take a while, but not bad for a quarter!</li>
    <li> A great buy for anyone that loves nail products. It has a lot of different shapes and came quick in the mail</li>
    <li> these were a whole lot better than I thought they would be...I love them.I Will do business again..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks, Jeannie</li>
    <li> I use these on my nails all the time and they don&#x27;t fall off and look great! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> They were delivered pretty fast but they were extremely small.</li>
    <li> Product as described,  I  will order again. I&#x27;m very pleaded with product. Can&#x27;t wait to use them on my projects.</li>
    <li> Beautiful! I love them. My daughter is pretty good with these and they can be tidious to work with but it can be done with the right handlers.</li>
    <li> This item does the job but there weren&#x27;t a lot in there as the picture suggests. Still worth the money but not worth the wait.</li>
    <li> they are what i needed. a little bigger then i thought, but itll work for me. they are what they say so im happy with that.</li>
    <li> -Poor quality&lt;br /&gt;-Definitely not 1200&lt;br /&gt;-Not super shiny when applied to the nail&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Was happy about prompt delivery time though even though it said it wasn&#x27;t supposed to deliver until many weeks out.&lt;br /&gt;*You get what you pay for! :]</li>
    <li> I like that they are differents i didnt get any of them repeted am a nail artist and this is a great product alot of pp comment on my nail all the time and ask were i get them lol</li>
    <li> A little difficult to get them on, I use tweezers and gel polish.  Takes a while to get because they ship from China.  Plain packaging, no information with them.  I guess it&#x27;s worth the $2 having to wait 3 weeks to get them.</li>
    <li> I was a little disapointed that all the gems were mixed up when I got them but what can you do.</li>
    <li> The gems were all mixed up in the container.</li>
    <li> looks great we ain&#x27;t had time to try them yet</li>
    <li> Perfect product. Item as described in the picture. I recommend it to anyone who likes art decorations on their nails.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought it would be but overall its pretty full and the little gem look nice. thank you!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and in good condition.  Beautiful shapes and designs.&lt;br /&gt;Would order again.</li>
    <li> Great product but the picture does show more rhinestones then when you actually receive the product</li>
    <li> some larger easier to handle crystals which makes it easier to use.  nice variety of shapes  delivered within promised guidelines</li>
    <li> Nothing bad to say here, it actually looks like there&#x27;s more stones then what the picture shows. These are very very small, that can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on what you&#x27;re looking for. I don&#x27;t mind it. The packaging is very secure and had no issues at all. Fast shipping,  got it almost 2 weeks before estimated date. Would definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> when I receive this particular product I did not like it because it was the 11 I ordered all rhinestones in the circle kind from big to small and they came all different shapes from big to small not circle but from square rectangle oval diamonds flower shapes that&#x27;s not what I asked for  ; (</li>
    <li> Only came with a hundred or so, false advertisement</li>
    <li> The Nail Art Gemstone attained well before the delivery date 2 weeks earlier it was empress and the stones also were of good quality and glittered beautifully they look gorgeous. Thank you</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as filled as the pictures looks like. In fact it some of the pieces have spilled out in the packaging it came in.</li>
    <li> Item size is about the size of a silver dollar. Was suppose to be all different shapes as in image but instead were the same shape in different sizes. Less then 300 in all.</li>
    <li> Great product for a cheap price. Only complaint is that when you slide the container open some rhinestones fall out.</li>
    <li> Again too small to work with even for a younger person with small fingers.  Too frustrating.</li>
    <li> These &#x27;do not&#x27; sparkle, so, if you&#x27;re going for those we buy with that glitz, this isn&#x27;t them.  Also, they stand fairly high on the nail so with normal daily use they won&#x27;t last more than a couple days.  I&#x27;m going to use them in my art journal, some  :(</li>
    <li> It is okay nothing special but for the price I can not complain too much.</li>
    <li> Is exact as the picture love it really goooood deal I recommend this pretty jewels for your nails&lt;br /&gt;Yes pretty</li>
    <li> They are awesome! They are exactly what I expected!&lt;br /&gt;I also like that the container can be used again after this product has been used up.</li>
    <li> These are so cute thanks</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-For once, the amount shown on the picture reflects how many you actually get (the little wheel was nice and full!!)&lt;br /&gt;-Very cute accent pieces: butterflies, flowers, hearts, triangles, ovals, long rectangles, stars, large round crystals, smaller round crystals, bows and teardrops&lt;br /&gt;-reasonable shipping time&lt;br /&gt;-GREAT price for what you get&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Uneven amounts of the pieces (I got 0 moons, 2 teardrops, 5 stars, and a bunch of butterflies, hearts, and triangles) and I really wanted half moons!!!&lt;br /&gt;-Some were stuck to the lid and mixed up so it took some time to reorganize and place them in their separate compartments</li>
    <li> I love the variety pack. I&#x27;m having crazy fun with the endless possibilities these nail gems provide.  They&#x27;re also the perfect size and if applied the right way, can last at least a week with proper maintenance.</li>
    <li> really nice and cute designs and plenty in amount</li>
    <li> Great selection of shapes and sizes.  Small like you need for nail art decorations.  Super great price.  Try them yourself.</li>
    <li> Nice little surprise. They are fun.</li>
    <li> great item so glad that I ordered it... exactly what it stated it was and no issues of any note</li>
    <li> I would give it more stars if i received it!?</li>
    <li> Plenty of pieces for my 10 yr old to practice doing her own nails. She loves this big kit !</li>
    <li> great wheel and handy storage that allows you to open and close easily I am happy with all the shapes</li>
    <li> Got exactly what I bought - shipped from China so it took forever</li>
    <li> quantity not as described, received maybe 125 rhinestones, will not order again</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my nail art.</li>
    <li> I got these so that I can stop playing an extra fee at my salon. I got these for less than the cost of what one application would cost.</li>
    <li> Takes a few weeks to ship,  but the price is worth the wait!</li>
    <li> Cute, perfect size and a nice variety</li>
    <li> Very pretty a bit difficult to handle and the plastic case is a little flexible. I would order again though, mainly because of the price.</li>
    <li> Was very happy with prompt delivery time seeing as how it arrived before the estimated date however I am not happy with the quantity of shapes you receive! There&#x27;s are 12 compartments but the amount of gems that were in each compartment did not add up to 1200 pieces! And although the gems are very small I hand counted to make sure they were all there and the were NOT!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT THEY MAKE MY NAILS LOOK BLING OUT , I ALSO USE THEM AS SOME CRAFT STUFF I&#x27;M DOING THE CASE COULD BE A LITTLE MORE BETTER BUT OVERALL I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> There are lots of shapes to choose from. Great size for nails or any craft project you might be doing.</li>
    <li> These supposedly rhinestones are not only small, but I don&#x27;t see 1200 of them. They are small and odd shaped. Most of mine were like aluminum scrap and had no shape.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if there is actually 1200 little gems in this (I kind of doubt it) but I like using them, they&#x27;re easy to use, very cute, and shipped in time.</li>
    <li> These are a great addition to anyone&#x27;s nail designs. They are easy to apply with a curved tweezers and stays put when applying a top coat after application or my preference (sealing them with gel nail polish)</li>
    <li> I feel this product was totally misrepresented.  Notice it does say &amp;#34;rhinestone&amp;#34;.  I felt they were closer to tiny plastic bits and shapes....sort of at best.  I thought I was purchasing various sizes of actual rhinestones.  Sooooo wrong.  Would not recommend this unless you just want tiny little pieces on your nails.</li>
    <li> I really like the variety of shapes in this assortment. Who doesn&#x27;t love nail bling? The price is nice too.</li>
    <li> Wow, an awful lot for a little! Very happy with this, all the stones are nice. As far as I could see too, they weren&#x27;t mixed or anything when they came in the mail. Also, theres a ton of shapes to choose from. WOOT!</li>
    <li> i didnt think from the pic that they would be such small sized jewels but i rocked them anyway! cute!</li>
    <li> I have different models and is very easy to use. thanks My friends loved it&lt;br /&gt;The color is perfect  I can use use any color of nail polish</li>
    <li> Very pretty &amp; lot&#x27;s of different shapes. Is kind of thick but still okay if you are going to stack other smaller ones on top of it.</li>
    <li> was expecting for it to come in the wheel but it was in  a small plastic bag.  Still beautiful though</li>
    <li> So cute &amp; small very pretty on my nails</li>
    <li> Great amount shipping was early</li>
    <li> arrived fairy quick. lots of designs. i&#x27;m glad it didn&#x27;t get all scrambled together during the shipping process! container is smaller than the average palm. but there&#x27;s a lot of rhinestones in each.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the wheel I the picture, it&#x27;s much smaller than I expected. It&#x27;s pretty full but I doubt very seriously that there&#x27;s 1200 pieces about 500, it looks full because the wheel is tiny. I&#x27;ll except it because the price was fair for what I received! Probably won&#x27;t order this again!</li>
    <li> It was ok thanks for the fast delivery</li>
    <li> I like the product if only it didn&#x27;t take a year to arrive!!!</li>
    <li> These Stones have a very expensive look to them.  Several women have asked where I got them.  I&#x27;ll be ordering them again.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as cute as I expected, but for the price, not worth returning. They will be used. Not as sparkly as I hoped.</li>
    <li> There aren&#x27;t 1200 rhinestones in this little guy, but that&#x27;s all right. Mine came damaged, though, with one whole section missing. :(</li>
    <li> Great accent to have in your 3D nails art collection. I did a coat of clear polish (to serve as the &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34;) and stuck on the stones and most stayed on the entire duration, 10-14 days. Great Price, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> very sparkly there are plenty of stones and they do come in different shapes and sizes. you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> delivered safely. looks not too bad, not too good. just enough for the price. for daily use, it is very good i guess.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice. And of course with such a great price i can&#x27;t complain too much.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that it says 12 different shapes and some of mine were repeats&lt;br /&gt;i got:&lt;br /&gt;flowers, rectangles, tear drop , stars, triangles, hearts, squares and (pointed) ovals</li>
    <li> Its really small I thought the circle would be a lil bit bigger but otherwise it is fine fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This item is not what I expected.  The gemstones are so tiny and hard to work with.  I guess you get what you pay for. I must say though that delivery of the product is satisfactory.</li>
    <li> Perfectly sized for nail art - oftentimes nail art items are much too big. These are absolutely perfect. But there is definitely MUCH less than shown in the picture. Probably about half of what is shown. Would have given 5 stars if compartments were full as shown.</li>
    <li> I love these really cute shaped rhinestones, there are so many different shapes, something for everyone. The little girls love them. Great price too!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase . I thought it would be bigger as it appears in the picture but overall I&#x27;m content with my purchase. I would buy from here again .</li>
    <li> they look pretty good though I haven&#x27;t tried them out yet - It will be fun to play with them.</li>
    <li> loVE THESE AND THE PRICE IS JUST RIGHT</li>
    <li> Love these great and easy to apply not to big or too small!</li>
    <li> Very different from my other Nailart. My customers love the variety of shapes. Pleased with this selection. Will opt to buy more when needed. Thanx.</li>
    <li> The stones were blinding! I loved this they came in a variety of sizes and shapes. There were so many! i was so excited. It took a little while for them to get to me, but it was totally worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I have over the past few months gotten really into nail art and these are such a great accessory to add some bling to nails!</li>
    <li> I thought the case was a lot bigger, it&#x27;s about 2inches in diameter. The pieces are small, so you need something to pick it up with and apply. Mine looks like the picture, the amount is great. Maybe not 1200 but still a lot. It will probably last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem, I thought they pieces were flatter. I wanted it to be almost like stickers but they are slightly thick, but not too noticeable. This can be a good thing, though. The shape are cute and the wheel is productive for organization. Overall, still very cute and elegant. Sticks to at least one coat of nail polish, no glue necessary. :)</li>
    <li> I think its okay they look really cheap(they are ) but they&#x27;re all poorly shapen, and when I got mine they were all mixed together.</li>
    <li> Adds a lot of flair to nails n very easy to use. I youtubed how to use. Loved it , I bought too many stones. Im going to add some to my cases for phones.</li>
    <li> It arrived early that was great and its easy to work with! I does my my five year old daughter nails all the time and they last long and i recommend nail glue to make sure it stays:)</li>
    <li> Bought this item for Mom...Rhinestones looked nice but, they are too small.&lt;br /&gt;Would get bigger sizes for her next time.</li>
    <li> Dont know what all the complaints are about. No its not stuffed full, yes shapes are kinda mixed up. But take a close look at the picture so are they, and you can see the bottom. Mine didn&#x27;t have the butterflies. But came with two different size circles and the rest, perfect for the price but does kinda take forever to arrive.</li>
    <li> I got these right on the estimated date and they were well packaged. There were absolutely no stones out of place or out of the wheel. They are all different shapes like hearts, stars, flowers, butterflies, rain drops, moons, circles, rectangles, triangles, little bows, curved rain drops, and squares. I was hoping that they had different sized circle stones but my niece got a kick out of these and she actually let me paint her nails to put them on. So that is definitely worth it to me. Also people talk about the wheel being loose and letting the stones fly everywhere, well mine was snug and took a little effort to turn. I suppose that doesn&#x27;t matter to me as long as they are all safe and sound in their wheels.</li>
    <li> Had been going to school for nail technology and these were a gift for that, they where amazing and exactly what I needed for class, until they were stolen.  (Yes I now have my licence!)</li>
    <li> These are just what I was looking for. A great price and look. They stayed on for at least two weeks</li>
    <li> It is not the same as the picture . It is full of junk, not practical at all . G</li>
    <li> Love all of the different shapes! These crystals will bling out any nail design,and you don&#x27;t have to be a professional to use them</li>
    <li> this is a good buy for the price very small pieces great for nails and decorating other items would recommend</li>
    <li> Good. Nice. Okay. Alright. As expected. In one piece. Nifty. Shiny. A-ok. Acceptable. Satisfactory. Valuable. Favorable. Neat. Pleasant. Agreeable. Commendable.</li>
    <li> This product is a good value for the price. I love how the rhinstones look on nails. The different shapes make these great for multiple age groups.</li>
    <li> The item was small I thought it was going to be medium sized. But the Rhinestones are easy to put on no struggle and the rhinestones weren&#x27;t out of place when I received it.</li>
    <li> Love rhinestones, good price for the amount received. They were a little smaller than I was expecting, but that is no fault of the seller.</li>
    <li> It is small and compact fits anywhere. If you need to take it somewhere to do another&#x27;s nails, this is perfect and beautiful.</li>
    <li> This set has a lot of rhinestones and is an amazing deal for the price.  I use them mostly for nail art, but have also used them in other crafts.  I love the all the shapes and options!  Arrived at the beginning of the estimated delivery time, so I was also happy with that.</li>
    <li> These are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Many different shapes and sizes&lt;br /&gt;-Hold well on nail&lt;br /&gt;-Look good on the nail&lt;br /&gt;-Do not look cheaply made&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Hard to get a hold of.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot of glue ons on my nails as I tend to be hard on my hands, but its nice to have for that special night out.  These are pretty tiny so I don&#x27;t feel overwhelmed when I am wearing them.</li>
    <li> just what I needed and delivered when said would....using for crafts and fits the bill perfectly thank  you ... ...</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these gems, I love how many different shapes there are. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the top of it is so loose that it slides over and all the gems fall out and/or mix with each other.</li>
    <li> this is a very small container and I seriously doubt that there are 1200 rhinestones. I estimated about 700-800 stones( got tired of counting).  I have yet to use the stones so I cant comment on the quality.</li>
    <li> granddaughter very happy with them</li>
    <li> This is a great little set! Silver is the color of gem I most commonly use (it goes with everything), and this set gives me a ton of options! They stick great, and came at a great price. These are also very small, so they look a lot more elegant than most gem sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly, my biggest praise is for the gem container. It&#x27;s well designed and almost completely prevents the gems from mixing. With other gem sets, I&#x27;ve had to relocate the gems into a better container, but this one is perfect! A great plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this set to a friend.</li>
    <li> This item came super early- like way earlier than expected and there are so many rhinestones.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re very sparkly and blingy, and just the right size for any type of nail art.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this seller and item and if you&#x27;re skeptical, I recommend getting this product.</li>
    <li> Cheap foil style. Really too small to use</li>
    <li> Cute. Have not used it yet.</li>
    <li> My nails are always looking pretty .. Nice &amp; small rhinestones for a great price</li>
    <li> I ordered this mainly for the moon shaped rhinestones, and I was very excited to get it.  The package I received does NOT have any different shaped rhinestones.  They are all just round ones.  They are cute but I am sad that it wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> This wheel is small but it has a lot of silver rhinestones of different shapes. They static cling to the top of the wheel, the turning part and so they are scattered everywhere. I bought for my daughter and she is anxious to try them out. They are perfect size. Delivery came two days early.</li>
    <li> It was my faul for buying these i waa trying to get bigger size but didnt pay clse attention. They did come in handy for spall spaces in my projects but not as shiny</li>
    <li> This product came way before i expected, I have lots of shapes and different sizes to choose from, I am very happy with my purchase, and i will definitely be buying from them in the future...</li>
    <li> good for the price , I would buy this product again and I probably will, only wish the waiting period was shorter</li>
    <li> Priceless for nail art addicts like me! Great!</li>
    <li> we more better than I saw in the photo :)</li>
    <li> these are cute, the actual pieces are a lot smaller than i expected. not too happy with the construction of the case because the pieces get stuck on the clear part on top that turns to every slot, and it makes it a little hard to turn to the slot that you want to go to. besides the construction of the case, the gems are perfect to add a little pop to your nails without overwhelming your nails</li>
    <li> These came in the mail really fast. They stick to my nails pretty easily with just a dab of nails polish and they stay. Some of the stones were out of place, but that&#x27;s okay. There are a large variety of shapes and sizes so you can do many different styles on your nails. Would buy again. Although it would take me awhile considering the fact that there are soooo many stones.</li>
    <li> They became dull before I could even get the top coat on. Normally, the rhinestones are still shiny after I glue them to the nail. To coat makes them shine even more.</li>
    <li> Another great bargain for nail art. A lot of beautiful crystals making it worth the small cost. They are very small and more difficult to use.</li>
    <li> They look cheap. I would only recommend them if you&#x27;re doing a little girls nails and you don&#x27;t really care that they look cheap.</li>
    <li> These are so cute, and work perfectly. Great buy, and I had no issues receiving it.  I use these very often, and everyone seems to be jealous of them!</li>
    <li> TINY TINY TINY and with about 10 things In each section not worth even a dollar, pathetic, awful cheap terrible horrible crap</li>
    <li> I have been to department stores and specialty stores but couldn&#x27;t find  rhinestones that weren&#x27;t huge but these are a perfect size and many cute shapes! Shipped quickly and packaged safely in a small container.</li>
    <li> just recv my little package in mail after more than 3-*4 weeks not happy at all&lt;br /&gt;they dont shine not happy at all</li>
    <li> The picture makes it look like you get a lot more than they actually give you. But they are okay.</li>
    <li> Bling! Bling! Pretty toes and pretty hands!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is as described and will work for me playing around with my own nails, but I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because there is NO WAY there are 100 of each shape.  Not even close on some shapes.  Like I said, for just me it will be fine, and for what I paid I&#x27;m not going to whine too much because the ones I did get are great! But don&#x27;t expect to get 1200 jewels.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of random pieces that were left over from the stamping.  Because they come from Hong Kong, everything took awhile to get but these took probably 5 or more weeks.  Don&#x27;t order if you are in a hurry for something.</li>
    <li> I do my own nails because nail salons in my area are few and far between, crowded, and expensive.  These look great.  I recommend using special tweezers to apply them.</li>
    <li> After reading comments that there weren&#x27;t 1200 I counted. 506 only and not equal amounts the most was 63 moons and least 17 hearts. Their not rhinestone more like the old stick  earrings we had as kids. For the price I&#x27;m not going to bother sending them back, will cost as much to do that</li>
    <li> There was tons and tons of rhinestones. Was very happy With the quality! Def must have for nail techs for nail art</li>
    <li> I dont like all the shapes but this was a great buy and I needed some more nail rhinestones. Woop.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was a bunch of different shapes, which is my own mistake.. A few of those shapes I&#x27;ll never end up using.. I bought it for the round crystal gem looking ones.. They&#x27;re a bit small and way flatter than expected... But I also didn&#x27;t really read the description</li>
    <li> Salon Quality&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how long I had to wait for the product.  It took over a month and there was no tracking information.</li>
    <li> The rhinestones are very shiny giving the art a nice look, (i have bought some and they have been dull). they make a pretty good purchase</li>
    <li> I thought it came with glue and tweezers, it did not.</li>
    <li> So I just got it today and sorry to say but there are not an equal amount of gems in there so u might want to buy two of these wheels.. other then that they are to cute love them</li>
    <li> These are very nice until you put a top coat over them! They lose thier shine and you can barely tell what design the stone is. Maybe these would be good to decorate a cell phone case with but not for nail art</li>
    <li> My daughter is very happy to have all of these! She should not run out for a long time! I would order again!</li>
    <li> It took a while for them to come in but once they got here pretty excited to start working with them. Very cute designs</li>
    <li> Cute but just not as many as it says it comes with but I guess for a $1 can&#x27;t really complain</li>
    <li> I received my product fairly early which was the great part, but when you look closely at the product, all the rhinestones are the same shape -_-</li>
    <li> I ordered these thinking the rhinestones themselves would be larger. They are very small. Upside is they come in a great container to keep them all.</li>
    <li> Very Disappointed with this purchase.. Wrong Information about product. It clearly says that 12 different shapes and sizes rhinestone but what I got is only round shape rhinestone. I emailed to seller 2 times but I did not get any reply. Common If you are selling one shape rhinestone then why are you misleading the buyer.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize there were a bunch of different shapes, I thought it was all just flat circle rhinestones. But it&#x27;s actually kind of nice that you can use different shapes</li>
    <li> I love the different shapes that come with it...butterflies, hearts, diamonds, etc. It gives great bling and dimensions.  Only thing I&#x27;m not so thrilled about is that it can be a pain to turn to open to a different shape.</li>
    <li> As I expected, very nice collection! Got it sooner than I expected. Would recomment it to anyone seeking these fun nail art pieces. The price was great for what I received. Many shapes and sizes, all shiny...bling!</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for. And for me I hardly got anything. There were maybe 10 pieces in each shape. Not happy with this at all</li>
    <li> Great size selection is very very nice - did not buy it to use as nail art - bought it for my niece who will use it for cricket and crafting projects</li>
    <li> It came earlier than I expected, but it was wayyyy smaller than I thought it would be. As for the crystals I thought they were a bit on the tiny side, yes of course you can them small, but not tiny. Might use sender again, but not for this product.</li>
    <li> Again thought I bought rhinestones. These will do.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i was looking for to do my nail art!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love using these rhinestones!</li>
    <li> I ordered these to use as gems for nail art but the moment you put clear top coat on them they get foggy. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> These are okay, but I wouldn&#x27;t really call them rhinestones. It&#x27;s hard to describe exactly, but they&#x27;re more just silvery plastic pieces. Otherwise, there was a good variety of shapes, the case was fine, and they arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> In general, it&#x27;s a good product for its price. I read the reviews before I bought them, so I knew the downsides beforehand. It&#x27;s not super shining, but it looks ok.</li>
    <li> The are very tiny , but they do stay on until you take the nail polish off. I use a top coat over the gems to finish.</li>
    <li> For what I paid for it, its worth it. Cute designs and easy wheel to find what you want and close up.</li>
    <li> This product is plactic shaped to look like rhinestones.  It doesnt reflect in any type of light. The shapes are so small you can barely tell the difference</li>
    <li> These are tiny rhinestones, clear on one side with silver backing. They are a great addition to any manicure. I&#x27;m more of a girly girl and like one in the upper corner of each nail. My sister, who goes for a more natural look, put a moon and star shape on one ring finger and a diamond on the other.&lt;br /&gt;The shapes included are;&lt;br /&gt;butterfly&lt;br /&gt;droplet (curved)&lt;br /&gt;moon&lt;br /&gt;flower (five petals)&lt;br /&gt;almond shape&lt;br /&gt;triangle&lt;br /&gt;bow tie&lt;br /&gt;star&lt;br /&gt;square (or tilted to the side- a diamond)&lt;br /&gt;droplet (straight like rain drop)&lt;br /&gt;heart&lt;br /&gt;rectangle&lt;br /&gt;All of the shapes are cute on nails, even if &amp;#34;rectangle&amp;#34; sounds boring, it really looks cute like a long square cut diamond.&lt;br /&gt;These are about 2 to 5 millimeters across. You will need tweezers to apply these. The best way to apply is to take out a single one, place it rhinestone side up on a table or in the palm of your hand, apply it with tweezers to a fresh coat of polish, delicately arrange to be in the right place, right side up, and then top with a clear coat. These last longer than others I&#x27;ve tried, probably because they are so small that they don&#x27;t get snagged on anything. I can&#x27;t believe how good the price is. It comes with so many.</li>
    <li> I got a lot of different shapes. an easy to use container and the only flaw is that when you paint over them with clear paint they become very cloudy and lose their sparkle.</li>
    <li> great pieces for the nails to look cool and great all different ones for all my nails to look cool</li>
    <li> Nice little plastic accents - for the cost and going by the image I didn&#x27;t expect actual &amp;#34;stones&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;rhinestones&amp;#34;, they are what I paid for - cute, cheap (just over $1.00 U.S, shipped, where/when I purchased) accents that will be pretty on my toesies! Love the handy little wheel too, is sturdy and has held everything in place - hoping to reuse for my bottled accents when I need to reorded more of these silver ones. :) Will certainly purchase again when needed.</li>
    <li> Great stones, fun to work with and easy to use for different designs. Great price and great quality for what you paid for.</li>
    <li> The rhinestones are actually very small, but I find that perfect for nail art and considering my nails are curved and not flat. It comes with hearts, teardrops, diamond shapes, bows, squares, butterflies, moons, flowers, stars, rectangles, triangles, and a kind of sideways tear drop that I don&#x27;t know the name of. There are a LOT of each shapes, and all shine bright. Very cute!</li>
    <li> I raided my friend&#x27;s manicure drawer and used up a bunch of her jewels. I found this for her to add to her supplies and I hope she likes it. Super low price and Great value.</li>
    <li> The gems are to big for your nails lol it looks abnormal and freakeshly big to the point it doesn&#x27;t look good.</li>
    <li> I expected more stones. I cant imagine there are 1200 stones inside of it. But they are all so small, it probably be 1200.&lt;br /&gt;I hoped there would be more sqaure and round stones in it, cause those are used more often. After all: good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t clean the stones with a regular polishremover after usage. But if you search for a gentle remover without aceton there could be a chance you can use them again. My first attempt with aceton failed. :)</li>
    <li> I was very surprised and happy to receive the product well before expected. Over all I really like the gems for nail designs but they are a little on the cheesy side for quality. However that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much. I was very happy over all.</li>
    <li> Well first off these took forever to ship but that&#x27;s okay I guess. I like most of the shapes, there is hearts, flowers, teardrops, stars, triangles, bows, circles, squares, moons and butterflies. They&#x27;re pretty, not sparkly though. Though these are not rhinestones, they&#x27;re like plastic over shiney paper or something-that&#x27;s what it looks like anyways. I would recommend these for average &amp;#34;rhinestone&amp;#34; nail art.</li>
    <li> I like this product and the container is pretty good. It&#x27;s just somewhat hard to get the gems out of the container.</li>
    <li> These are so pretty and last forever!!!! Great Deal!!!!</li>
    <li> These are not rhinestone!!!!  They look more like little pieces of foil.  I am very disappointed.  I will not even try to use them.  If the postage was not so much I would return them.</li>
    <li> These rhinestones are absolutely adorable!!!! I love how many shapes came in this one tiny package! Just so you know though it is not as Big as it looks on the screen!!! It&#x27;s probably only three inches side!</li>
    <li> Great price. Easy to use and handle. The shine fades once you put it a top coat over it and turns a bit yellow. I like to put a top coat over everything to make sure it sticks for a good while. It was cheap but I won&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> SUPER fun and way easier to use than I would have guessed.  Great way to ad POW to your DIY mani</li>
    <li> This arrived very quick was just as described fits in the palm of your hand very easy to work with on nails</li>
    <li> There are a ton of varieties in here. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is if you don&#x27;t keep the container upright then the gems get mixed together. That&#x27;s my only complaint. Love the variety!</li>
    <li> My friend I bought this for really liked it and was very excited. I would buy again. thank you once again.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly and as desribed. I use a coat of clear polish over my designs and add the gems, then add another coat of clear polish. The gems stay on until I am ready to change designs. Love it!</li>
    <li> When I tell you I was shocked by how small this dial is!  The dial can fit in the palm of your hand, and the stones are tiny!  Next time I will order bigger stones, and there is no way that are 1200 crystals in this thing.  Its def not worth your money, and the shipping took quite long as well.  Spend your money elsewhere</li>
    <li> I agree that the # of pieces isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s advertised, but for the price, it is still a ton!  We won&#x27;t be able to use them all fora long time, but when we do,  I&#x27;d buy it again. And mine were sorted and in their container.</li>
    <li> This item show that its a full amount but when you get it, it only have a few for one set  or less of nails maybe if ur nice you can try (10)  but so far I didnt a chance to use them yet</li>
    <li> This order took a while to received (on in the US) but i do like the different designs that came in (moons, starts, circles, squares, etc)  The sizes are perfect - not too big.</li>
    <li> These are really fun shapes. They&#x27;re easy to apply.</li>
    <li> The little girl I purchased these for loves them.  She loves doing nails and this was a great addition to her collection.</li>
    <li> Nice bling bling for your nails, that&#x27;s easy to use and stays on for 3-4 weeks, with the use of the right glue!</li>
    <li> I thought it would have been allot bigger though, I like that it has so many designs, not just the same stones in different colours... worth the buy</li>
    <li> cutest ever , in early and adorable, i will def order these over and over</li>
    <li> Some of the compartments were mixed together but no big deal. These are cute :)</li>
    <li> great product you get all different shapes and sizes and they come in this cute little case that makes it impossible for them to get mixed up</li>
    <li> love it page was good love what i got was not crak when i got it love it going to by more</li>
    <li> I love all the different shaped gems. I had the one that looks like bows on may nails and they looked super cute</li>
    <li> the count is off, and the size of each piece was different, the shapes were not equal to each other. However it came on time and i think the price is still OK for that amount of pieces. maybe try not to failed advertise../</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t stay on ny nails.</li>
    <li> small wheel of different shaped clear rhinestones. hearst, diamonds, circles, squares, etc. smaller than expected but can&#x27;t complain for a dollar.</li>
    <li> The style is different but it comes in many shapes... it gets a 4/5 because some of the shapes are a little off but there&#x27;s mre to pick from so it&#x27;s not such a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;i would buy from them again ^^ and it&#x27;s fun to decorate these on your nails :D because it is just silver.</li>
    <li> Used with gel polish and very pleased</li>
    <li> I love the fact that there are many sizes and that they are flat back for easy application. Great price for 1200 crystals. I purchased in store for $2 and only got 20.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t look as full as the picture but its worth the dollar spent on it. Came well packaged. My nails look cute.</li>
    <li> there was multiples it was not 12 different it was 8different..&lt;br /&gt;bows&lt;br /&gt;,tear drop looking ones&lt;br /&gt;,half moons&lt;br /&gt;flowers,&lt;br /&gt; butterflies,&lt;br /&gt;triangles&lt;br /&gt;squares&lt;br /&gt;rectangle&lt;br /&gt;but they are usable and cheap so its whatever</li>
    <li> These are perfect!! Super cute gems and in a awesome deal. There are different shapes and so many ways to create different designs!! The container makes it easy to keep all these gems in and organized. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I just received these and they are exactly as described. They will look great on nails and they are the perfect size so it will be easy for them to stay on.</li>
    <li> These are NOT rhinestones as advertised. Apparently every package is different. I planned to only use the circles and there were no circles included in my package. Static electricity is a real problem and they stick together, move around and are a general mess. I received two sizes of teardrops, butterflies, hearts, squares,bows and a shape I can&#x27;t figure out. The small ones are TINY. If I use any it will be the large squares. As other reviewers have said, it is difficult to believe that there are 1200 pieces in the dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;I may use the large squares. The rest are a waste of money. Calling them \\&quot;Crystal Premium Quaslity Gemstones\\&quot; is a joke. I am glad that this is the only package I bought from this company. I would be very upset if I had a professional manicure and they put this junk on my nails.</li>
    <li> Great deal. I will taking them with me on my next pedicure!  I probably will expire before I run out of these.</li>
    <li> My order was delivered ahead of schedule. The jewels Look to be in great condition. However, there are not 1200 pieces. There are 12 slots, each with different shapes and sizes. I counted 4 compartments and they have a little over 40 in each. The other compartments don&#x27;t have that much more than the 4 i counted. So I can assume there are not 1200. There should be 100 in each if the 12 spaces, But there are not.</li>
    <li> Love,love,love these!!  These worked great, and were easy for me to get out of the container.  I only used nail polish to stick them on and it worked pretty well.  I also used glue to stick these on cards and gift decoration.  Glued some to my hat to give it bling.  Works great!</li>
    <li> The jewels are very cute but the wheel is not the size it appeared to be in the picture.  The wheel is MUCH smaller and so are the crystals.  They are a bit difficult to place because they are so tiny but they do look pretty once you manage to get them on there.</li>
    <li> Beautiful design.  Nice finish, shiny, cute, I just loved them. You will need tweezers.  They come in in different shapes.</li>
    <li> so many different design to choose from and designs what ever what ever you choose to do the sky is the limit</li>
    <li> They are not being used for the nails, they are being glued on to things that my daughter and her friends make when they come over.</li>
    <li> super crappy material..</li>
    <li> all the shapes are awesome. i pull this wheel out almost every time i do nails now. well worth the price. super cute nail art.</li>
    <li> Took a while to get to me but it came neatly packaged. For a while, I thought they were just silver from the way it looked from the outside but they were mostly all turned over. They came in different shapes as well...flowers and teardrops and such. I love them!</li>
    <li> The packaging had static in it so when I went to take out a jewel, it would stick to the plastic and the others would move.  I do like how the jewels fit on my nails.</li>
    <li> Perfect for decorating handmade cards. Adds a pretty sparkle without being overly flashy like glitter or colored sequins. I recently used on religious themed Christmas cards. I use a wax pencil  to pick up (about $1 or so on Amazon) and glue in place with Martha Stewart&#x27;s fine tip glue pen. Great assortment.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet but I was pleased with the overall product. I didn&#x27;t have time to count all the pieces to see if they were exactly 1200 but it looks close enough.  I&#x27;m not worried about the amount since there&#x27;s many different shapes. I totally recommend this to anyone who wants a little bling to their nails without paying the salon price.  It came before the estimated delivery date too ^_^</li>
    <li> Okay so this is my second product I bought from this account and I am very displeased with this one to.! Once again not as many gems as they say! Very UNHAPPY!!!</li>
    <li> i bought this and delivery came really quick&#x27;  ,its pretty easy to put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will have to oder more when these r done. thanks</li>
    <li> Love that I can sparkle my nails up!  Appreciated the timely delivery</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re expecting them to be bigger. The package was to small</li>
    <li> the product is exactly what I expected, I am satisfied with this item, its size is perfect and the color is very pretty, I love</li>
    <li> I used this product for nail art and it is wonderful. Very impressed in how quickly I received my package. Everything was neatly packed and would definitely use them again.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I was looking for. These are not really rhinestones more like pretty shapes. They do not shine in the light and they are very difficult to see.</li>
    <li> loved them, just what I wanted! I am starting my own business and these were great! the price was righ too.</li>
    <li> What a disappointment. They look very dull and not sparkly at all . They are plastic not no little rhinestones&lt;br /&gt;Would not buy again</li>
    <li> They are cute, beautiful and I can use them for a lot of different projects. Very happy with them, THANKS!</li>
    <li> I ordered it cause it has different shapes.&lt;br /&gt;but what I got was just same shape also It&#x27;s not even 1200.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s at most 20 of each, and there&#x27;s 12 compartments, so about 240 total. Still a good deal for the money!! but totally false advertising in the title. If they said 300, I wouldn&#x27;t complain, but c&#x27;mon, 1200... Glad I read the reviews beforehand.</li>
    <li> I love these rhinestones. What it doesn&#x27;t show in the picture is that they come in different cute shapes. There is moons, butterflies, hearts, circles, squares, triangles, stars and more!!</li>
    <li> I expected to be bigger pieces but it is ok. It has beautiful and different shapes. I can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
    <li> Nothing like a little rhinestone on the toes</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner than expected. They look soo cute! Although I must say this is way smaller than I expected hence why I only give it 4 stars. I wish the plate was bigger with more pieces. But I maybe should have read more of the details. Still love it though!</li>
    <li> Perfect for applying easily with top coat, great value.</li>
    <li> The rhinestones are cute, but I did not receive 1200.</li>
    <li> Took a very long time on the delivery.  Rhinestones are OKAY but not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> This is a great rhinestone  wheel for pro nail techs. It has round stones of different sizes, moons, stars, hearts, &amp; butterflies.</li>
    <li> Great product for nail decorating. So fun to use and nails look beautiful! I recommend this product to those who like to have fun with their nails.</li>
    <li> These are $10 plus in stores around town,  and you don&#x27;t get as many stones. This was a money savings purchase!!!!!</li>
    <li> I thought these were great for the prize there cute and look great on the nail fast delivery I would def buy more</li>
    <li> The stones were not separated into their own slots. I had to dump the entire wheel and sort them myself. This isn&#x27;t hard, but it was time consuming. I have never had to do this with any other stones I have purchased so I am hoping this doesn&#x27;t become a new repeat issue. I&#x27;d rather pay a little more at my local nail store to have them separate them for me upon purchase.</li>
    <li> There was different shapes as promised and they are not all mixed up together. I haven&#x27;t tried using them yet, so I don&#x27;t know if the quality is good. The only thing is that there is not 1200 in the wheel! Not even close, but overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product (:</li>
    <li> Although this item took quite a while to get to me, I love it. There are many shapes and sizes these rhinestones come in. &#x3D;D They are cute and pretty. I had my friend do my toenails and they look pretty darn good. It came really cheap but works wonderfully. For those who love doing their nails and toenails, I recommend this. It works great.</li>
    <li> Love them &amp;  use them all the time.</li>
    <li> These stones are really cute,  and came in all the shapes pictured.  The only problem I had was when I first opened it,  it was tricky so I dropped so many.  Make sure to be careful when opening it,  which you&#x27;re supposed to twist until you get to an opening.  On my thumb (not pictured well) I have one in the shape of a seed,  second finger is a teardrop,  middle is a titled square,  ring finger has a flower,  and pinky has a circle.  The most they lasted with a top coat was about a week,  and they didn&#x27;t come undone with anything!&lt;br /&gt;Ps.  The wheel did not come as full as pictured,  but still contained a good amount of stones.</li>
    <li> No complaints, looks just like the picture. I cannot wait to start gluing. Though, they are not sorted by size. Rather they are all mixed up.</li>
    <li> They work great for what they are. They are shiny, sparkly, and stay on for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
    <li> These are a tiny bit larger than I expected but still a great accent for nail designs. Makes a traditional polish job look more professional.</li>
    <li> Well I was very skeptical about ordering these bc of all the bad reviews but I&#x27;m glad I did! I ordered these 2/2/14, est delivery was 2/27-3/17. I recd them today (2/20/14). So I&#x27;m very happy they came early, it seemed like forever. I recd a small wheel with 12 diff slots. There were no gems out of place or out of wheel, packaging was good. Mine came with 12 different shapes but there was deff not 1200 gems rhinestones like it said. There was about 507 ( and I did count them so I could let it be known) this is what I recd; 32 triangles, 41 bows, 42 stars, 30 flowers, 45 hearts, 49 curved like teardrops, 61 circles, 50 rectangles, 37 butterfly looking shapes, 33 ovals, 55 squares, 31 straight teardrops. And the diff shapes are diff sizes and they are like plastic . Even though there were not as many as stated I&#x27;m still very happy with this product and glad I got it. They are deff cute and can be used for lots of diff things. I haven&#x27;t used them yet but I&#x27;ve used similar products and I think the best way to keep them on longer is to use nail glue but you can also use a top coat. I gave this 5 stars and would recommend it bc I received it before est delivery, they&#x27;re really cute and will deff be fun to use, and you can&#x27;t find this in any store and if you do it won&#x27;t be for this cheap price. So if you unsure about it like I was. I say go for it ! I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed. :-) hope this helps !</li>
    <li> I love these! so inexpensive and durable. I would consider this for the inspired nail artist. good to add to collection and really fast shipping</li>
    <li> The product arrived so late I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to receive it. The seller did contact me after my initial review and let me know when the order had been shipped and was very courteous and apologetic. The product was much smaller than I expected. I didn&#x27;t expect Swarovski crystals for that price so the fact they are silver backed and not all that shiny is not surprising. They are just TINY!! I actually think they will be perfect for kids and plan to use them for just that. Overall they are not a bad product and did take a long time but I will know now to maybe expect that when ordering from China.</li>
    <li> The description says it&#x27;s different sized rhinestones. When my order came in, LATE, it was different shapes! I did not want stars and moons etc, i wanted rhinestones. I wasn&#x27;t going to go through returning a dollar product, but I was upset. Maybe some people get the right thing, I mean, for a dollar I guess you should take the chance. If you get shapes, use them on your niece.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted. It is getting used. It was a great Christmas gift and the person loved it!</li>
    <li> rhinestones is what i thought i ordered and instead I got a cheap imitation of what I wanted, and it took forever to arrive. I had to wait a whole month for this product when it would have been cheaper for me to just have bought it at the store.</li>
    <li> Nice and organized rhinestone pack.  Plenty of stones for a long time.  Fun to wear and share.  We like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I love these little bail star, Hearts, and moons etc. I get to choose whatever I want on one Nail or all of my nails. I love the fact that they&#x27;re all different and shiny and silver.</li>
    <li> Love all the new nail art items out on the market today.  Even though I am not a pro, I do enjoy doing nails for friends and such.</li>
    <li> Nice package and they got here a little slow. I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry so all was well.</li>
    <li> Was exactly what was advertised. and was delivered on time. But was thinking I was going to get different styles of gems. It was 3 packs of the same styles.</li>
    <li> Quic Delivery! AWESOME collection of rhinestones, they are shiny and have a flat back to them so they sit on your nails nicely.</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied with my Rhinestones and my clients are excited to get their nails done with these stones!!!</li>
    <li> The rhinestones are very shiny and sparkly, which is what I wanted. They come in a few different shapes and sizes, which is nice for various projects. The only thing I hadn&#x27;t expected was the size, which was my own fault. I assumed they would be larger than they were. The sizes, though, are outlined in the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was pretty quick and I am overall very satisfied.</li>
    <li> They are ok for the price but NOT what is advertised. I was expecting rhinestones and these are just foil shapes.</li>
    <li> this are gifts and I know they will enjoyed them as much as me. Very cute and petite love the wheel.</li>
    <li> love it! its a tine case i thought it was more, but its worth it if you do your own manicures at home.</li>
    <li> I was half disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sizes. Not so various.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected 12 different sizes IN PERFECT ORDER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a mess!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I received this item about a week earlier that stated in delivery, and I was very happy with these.  I havent got to use them just yet but I cant wait to use them</li>
    <li> Great selection of rhinestones and conventionally stored. Nice to add some decorative gems to your nails! You can add a little or add a lot!</li>
    <li> This actually came a week and a half earlier than expected, which certainly made my day! Some of the shapes will take some extra creativity to think of designs and others I&#x27;m already coming up with ideas instantly. There aren&#x27;t any round rhinestones in this pack which is ok because this isn&#x27;t the only rhinestone pack I ordered and for the price compared to going to a local beauty store, I&#x27;m definitely not going to complain. Can&#x27;t wait to play with my nails!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with circles so that&#x27;s a little upsetting because that&#x27;s what I wanted. However they give you a great nail design no matter what and everyone ask my wife where she got her nails done because they look professional.</li>
    <li> I loved that they were all the same color and a lot of different shapes and sizes.  The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like it that it took so long to get to me.  I did get to me before that due to arrive date said and that is why I&#x27;m giving them 5 stars.</li>
    <li> With the price I can&#x27;t talk down too much about this product, however the packaging and shipping was horrible! I received it in the mail, cracked and half of the decals scattered everywhere in the box.</li>
    <li> This product s just what the other reviews are saying. Smaller than picture shows. No where near 1200 and received with the mixed up and falling out of there own little sections. However for the price you are paying for these I am still happy. If you want better quality you will need to pay more. These are just fine for me to do my own nails as well as my kids and grand kids</li>
    <li> I love these! I use them all the time. If you glue them right they stay one and look pretty (:</li>
    <li> Bought these for my daughter for Christmas and she loves them.  They are just like the salons use on their clients.</li>
    <li> I love the quality of the rhinestones, came well before expected. Thank you! I am a happy camper and cannot wait to use the rhinestones</li>
    <li> Okay so yea it is a good price, if you got what you were paying for. They did not fill the wheel. I only got 337 of them. If i could give no stars i would. This is crap. Not even half of what i was supposed to get</li>
    <li> Takes awhile to get them but you cant beat the price. Lots of different shapes to choose from. If you like to take some time to make your nails look nice these are great</li>
    <li> Great low cost product for your nails!! I&#x27;ve purchased many stones in the past and these were well worth my money and you get a lot.</li>
    <li> These are more of a little kids nail art thing. I thought they would be different sizes of standard nail rhinestones but they are more like bows and hearts instead of things as an adult that Id like. Description was vague...picture is as well. Beware your going to wait a month for them to arrive as well. Cheap enough that it really doesn&#x27;t bother me..another stocking stuffer for my ten year old :)</li>
    <li> this nail wheel has lots of stones! there are lots of pretty shapes such as crescents, hearts, squares, rectangles, stars, and so on. they are nice and shiny and teeny tiny so you can fit a lot of them on your nails!</li>
    <li> Amazing for the price!&lt;br /&gt;They came in a package smaller than i thought they would and the shapes aren&#x27;t quite the same, but for less than a dollar? You can&#x27;t beat that! Also, shipping said it would take over a month, but mine came in a little over a week.</li>
    <li> I bought this item in 2013 along with some other products. This product is very small and sort of hard to use! I love products like this but this one happened to be very little and i didnt like it.!</li>
    <li> I love these little gems. They come in many different shapes and the little thing they come in is so handy. They&#x27;re a bit disorganized but for the price I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I expected it to be much, much larger.&lt;br /&gt;It fits in the palm of your hand, not even 2&amp;#34; in diameter.</li>
    <li> Price for this was awesome, i make my own designs. and this has an assortment of shapes. I should of ordered more.</li>
    <li> They are actually mini metal plates, not rhinestones as titled.&lt;br /&gt;I will still use them, but was a little disappointed because I was expecting rhinestones.</li>
    <li> Great price! Under $1 for all these stones! Will make a great addition to my mani, pedi service! Thanks so much</li>
    <li> Yes, this is what I wanted but I was expecting them to catch the light or have a lot of sparkle. I just wasn&#x27;t that impressed.</li>
    <li> The picture shows an assortment of very sparkly gems but let me tell you they are not like that. The fake earrings at WalMart for $1 are more bright than these. They don&#x27;t make your nails look like the pictures on pinterest. If you want to add that extra something to your nails I would recommend up-ing  your price point. I bought these for $.86 with free shipping so technically I got what I paid for, which is why I&#x27;m giving this a 3-star review rather than a 1-star. Also, keep in mind these are being made and shipped from China.. that should explain the quality. Lastly, it took 27 days to get to me. Like I said, I got it with free shipping so I can&#x27;t complain too much but all in all I would&#x27;ve had a better experience throwing my $.86 in the ocean than getting these.</li>
    <li> Using these with the colored rhinestones are terrriffic. I love trying to use them in different ways. I hope I wil get more creative using them.</li>
    <li> There weren&#x27;t as many in there as there was supposed to be. I ordered 1200 for a reason, there are about 400.</li>
    <li> This silver moon rhinestone is perfect for designing nails and toes. You can create your own type of art on your hands and feet to match vlothinfgg or purses.</li>
    <li> Lots of stones.  Fun shapes.  Just very, very small.  They tend to slip out of their section.  Still great overall value.</li>
    <li> Took a little bit of time to arrive, but worth the wait.  Plan to use them this weekend when I do my nails.  Nice product. Recommend.</li>
    <li> Nail rhinestones. These look cute on my nails, and they were cheap. I love them. What else can I say.</li>
    <li> these are perfect they stay on pretty good. I put them on my self and put on about 3 layers of top coat. Only one fell off out of ten. And by the way I wash my hands frequently due to my job and it still stays on.</li>
    <li> love these little nail art design jewels. extremely cheap and cute! with a big variety.  Ordered on Oct 28 and i recieved them on Nov 21.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. There&#x27;s a lot of little small peices that you have to be careful with. Good product.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re so beautiful! It was perfect &amp; the perfect price! I&#x27;d buy them again for sure!! I love them(: -tatiana</li>
    <li> I think my granddaughter will just love these……price was right.  Came right from China and on time. She&#x27;s even researched these things on the internet on how to apply!</li>
    <li> This item is easy to use for nail art since it always sticks on the first time. I love this product!</li>
    <li> These are great just like the picture.  But Ebay has them cheeper for a lot more pieces. Will purchase from Ebay in the future</li>
    <li> very nice. super sparkly. a  lot better quality than i had thought or hoped for. will be ordering again. thanks</li>
    <li> I received my nail rhinestone pack in a timely manner and the quality is great.  I currently have two of the rhinestone bows on now.  My manicurist asked to buy the rest of my pack... but I told her no way.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than I expected. I got this for my niece for Christmas. The whole container is about the size of my palm.</li>
    <li> Yes I counted all the moons 68 &amp; I counted the ones that kinda look like mini bow ties their was 38. So no equal amounts in each slot, is their 1200 maybe. I love &#x27;em anyway I can&#x27;t wait to give them a try . I did flip it upside down &amp; shook it to see if they will mix &amp; they didn&#x27;t at all! So I&#x27;m pleased. I will buy from the seller again.</li>
    <li> Very Good!!! We like very much...We will order some more in next time...It is nice and beautiful....Recommend to buy some more in the future....</li>
    <li> they look nice in the container...&lt;br /&gt;but then, when you put it on your nail, the silver backing cracks and the rhinestone starts to fog from the nail polish....and even worse when you top coat.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy it.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I thought i was ordering something else my goof up sorry I passed them on to someone else to use,</li>
    <li> These little rhinestones are a great add on to my nail art collection. They are cute and I like the variety.</li>
    <li> thank you guys.you guys are awesome. my wife like your products and I will buy more stuff in near feature.</li>
    <li> My order came on time and exactly how it looked and was described.&lt;br /&gt;Would be better if they came in different sized though.</li>
    <li> I do like them...they did a little small but for the most part they are cute...u get all these different shapes and agian u can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> I received these more quickly than expected, and I was very pleased with the condition and variety.  The shapes are well-cut for the most part, and they are very easy to handle and apply.  I have received a lot of compliments on my nail art when using these!</li>
    <li> Love rhinestones but one downfall to these is that they are cheap and cheesy but what do u expect .</li>
    <li> I love all the diffrent shapes that come in this set! I used the butter fly on my nails and look forward to using more!!! I just wish they didnt all mix into each other.</li>
    <li> Love the vast assortment and different designs. Gives you something different aside from the standard Rhinestones that are just rainbow colored. The wheel helps keep the stones separate which is fantastic.</li>
    <li> These r very thick... I did not really like then but for the money I&#x27;m not going to return them... I can find some sort of use for them</li>
    <li> Perfect find! Cheap and pretty</li>
    <li> These are super cute, good quality, perfectly sized nail decorations, but there are no where close to 1,200 pieces. There are about 20 to 30 pieces in each shape category, making the total come to around 240-360, but for the price, I&#x27;m not too surprised or disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the variety of shapes: long rectangle, flower, star, paisley outline, heart, two sizes of circles (possibly 1 and 2 mm?), triangle, square, tear drop, crescent moon, and pointed ellipse/football.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is much smaller than I imagined, about 2 inches in diameter. The top of the wheel is clear plastic with one of the wedges cut out and it can be spun around so that when you are trying to get one shape out of the wheel, no other shapes come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are definitely worth it in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Love the price. They came right away. I have so many options in shapes to choose from. The packaging is nice and compact for storing.</li>
    <li> The picture is too small to identify that they&#x27;re shaped foil decals and not crystal decals. Not a bad product</li>
    <li> I bought these for my granddaughter.  She loves to do nails.  She was very pleased with them.  They are tiny, but she has tiny nails!</li>
    <li> Love these!  Can&#x27;t quite get the hang of putting them on my nails, as I need help from my daughter, but it&#x27;s so fun trying!  Love!!</li>
    <li> The assortment is amazing if you are into nails! Great product i recieved them in about 3 weeks not going to complain I love this product and no spill!!! packaged perfect! you get stars/moon/heart/flowers/alot more order it!</li>
    <li> Awful, very tiny, glitter sized. Not in the container, all over the place.</li>
    <li> I was expecting them to be a little bit better quality. I guess you get what you pay for with these.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and expected.  Good variety of shapes for nail art.  I would order again for sure. A+</li>
    <li> I bought these to try to learn to do my nails. I tried it and they look great. I definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> worth it, really cool nail art. can&#x27;t wait to use on all the girls &amp; myself for the summer. Our toes &amp; nails will look cool!</li>
    <li> wonderful fun for your nails</li>
    <li> It was not what I thought it was from the picture and description. These are not rhinestones, they are little silver designs</li>
    <li> These are very small and cute. Used on my daughter for her nails all silver shapes and sizes . .</li>
    <li> These damn things are horrible! Soon as glue or clear polish hit them they become dull and plastic looking..so embarrassing.. dont buy!!</li>
    <li> These are awesome little guys, comes in a pretty little container that is easy to spin around and access the shape you want, but not spill out the others. Love them and love the price.</li>
    <li> For a 12 yr old this is well worth the money!  These are not stick ons, so you will need a nail glue to stick good.</li>
    <li> Great product for price. Is as described.</li>
    <li> great nail gems, small but cute and lots of shapes.  can&#x27;t go wrong for the price!</li>
    <li> these are cool always using them to glue on my face or nails or vase or something they&#x27;re cool</li>
    <li> Love this! They were delivered weeks before I expected and are so shiny and I love all the different shapes.</li>
    <li> These stones are so low quality they are not even usable. It looks like dirty cloudy grey plastic on backing that is barely even silver. I don&#x27;t even know why someone would waste energy producing these other than take peoples money knowing it would cost more for a customer to send them back then it would for them to just throw them straight into the garbage. I feel scammed out of money.</li>
    <li> These were perfect, I loved them very much. Especially for an accent finger. I used all the square ones first.</li>
    <li> horrible i won&#x27;t even use these little rhinestones.. not at all what I had in mind. They are so small and there all mixed together, so I couldn&#x27;t even find what I was looking for if I was looking. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Ordered this item as a gift for a teenager that enjoys doing nails. Item is  very small but it&#x27;s good for the price. Received before ETA. Happy with item</li>
    <li> I was expecting 1200 rhinestones, like the description says. I&#x27;d say each of the 12 sections has at the most 15-20 rhinestones. The wheel is so small, less then 2 1/2 inches. All the jewels are mixed up and stuck to the top. It is not nearly what I expected. I would send it back, but it&#x27;s not worth the money. I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> I love nail art for cardmaking, but these spring-loaded wheels are very fragile, breaking easily. So, I just transfer the gems to a square container. This product is great and has enough bling to go as overboard as I want.</li>
    <li> I love little rhinestones, and I like how there is a variety in shapes and sizes. I don&#x27;t like the little plastic container they came in. You have to twist the top to move the opening to the individual wedge where the rhinestones are and they travel on the lid and get mixed into other wedges. I guess it&#x27;s not a huge problem since it&#x27;s still full; when it&#x27;s running low is when I&#x27;ll really notice that the wrong stones are in the wrong wedge. Also, I&#x27;m just super picky.</li>
    <li> This was a inexpensive stocking stuffer. She loved it. So very tiny. I am glad I purchased tweezers to with it. Very dainty</li>
    <li> Very nice rhinestones and I cannot wait to try them out on my nails, great deal, I just hope I don&#x27;t lose all of them.</li>
    <li> They look good, but i think the amount i received was way less then 1200. But it&#x27;s okay for this money.</li>
    <li> I ordered these, and they came a week later than the estimated delivery date. Which you know, sucks. Another bad thing about these little \\&quot;gems,\\&quot; is that they were all mixed up when I got them. I mean seriously, there are flowers and stars in every compartment, they got so mixed up! They are cheap plastic, and are by no means high quality. But for a dollar, it&#x27;s an okay buy.</li>
    <li> These little beauties are filled with sparkle and the stars seem to twinkle in the sun!  I use these on nails and in making necklaces.</li>
    <li> Good value for the price! There&#x27;s a lot of these little shinies in here! This will last this home manicurist a long time! Would order again. Recommend.</li>
    <li> MoYou has a distinctive image placed on their nail art wheels. The logo in the middle dial and the picture of Marilyn on the back, stating Rhinestones are a girl&#x27;s best friend. These are not premium crystal and not MoYou. That said, shipping was super fast for being from China, and they are the shapes advertised. They do cloud with top coat, so they are definitely not premium. Satisfied for the price, and shipping time, just know what you are ordering.</li>
    <li> These are so pretty and perfect for nail art.  I cant wait to order many more from this shippers. Excellent buy.</li>
    <li> Delivery was faster than expected. They are so cute  and tiny. I love that they are different shapes and nit the typical rhinestone. Perfect for nail art. I can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
    <li> the wheel came small as the pcs were stacked inside gives you the feel of having many pcs but in real they were less than 1200. so its not as described. other than that the shapes are nice and cute</li>
    <li> First time using this product and is easy to use and place on nails. Just add a dab of nail glue and you&#x27;re done!! It makes your nails look so much prettier than they already are :)</li>
    <li> Has more gems than I could ever ask for at this price!</li>
    <li> I purchased numerous nail art and I like the variety with this product.  I am happy with this product.  I did not have a problem with the shipper.</li>
    <li> They were threat. A little smaller than I expected but overall vet satisfied. For the price  it was really worth it. It also arrived sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Arrived as described. Didn&#x27;t understand the measurements so the stones are really small, but they&#x27;ll work. Nice shapes.</li>
    <li> Definitely not 1200 Rhinestones. When I received it the designs were all mixed with other. Quality looks ok...I haven&#x27;t used them yet though</li>
    <li> After these arrived, I was pleased that they were a little better than I expected. There are a bunch of different designs rather than just one or two things.</li>
    <li> the items are nice however I wish the case would have been designed a little better I spill so many</li>
    <li> It came really fast and there are so many options to choose from. Also the rhinestones are the perfect size and are easy to put on!</li>
    <li> This nothing like what they show and i am not happy at all. will not buy this item again. The rinestones are so small and the don&#x27;t even have a matching pair in the whole case so u can not use two of the same. So un happy Sorry i Purchased this!!!!</li>
    <li> they were super perfect for my nails absolutely love them I even used them to put on my cheer bows!</li>
    <li> What I&#x27;ve learned from ordering nail art accessories that come in these wheels is that the items mix together a bit as they travel. However, it&#x27;s not that big of a deal because they can easily be picked out with tweezers and put into the right tray. The pieces are large enough that not a lot of pieces moved around. Just some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to using them!</li>
    <li> I was thinking they were just regular rhinestones but i was wrong. They are very cute just not what i wanted.</li>
    <li> I will be using these soon on a nail design i love to use gems when styling my nails so it will always get 5 stars unless it not good, ( these are good)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t  see why I got write a bunch of words for something I like, now if I didn&#x27;t like I have a whole lot more to say. But I don&#x27;t cause I like it, it&#x27;s pretty cool!!!</li>
    <li> Thank you for your nice Nail Art Silver Moon Rhinestone Pack of 1200. It is very nice. Have a nice day!!!</li>
    <li> many different shapes. love the containers and the came quicker than i was told. will have lots of fun with these</li>
    <li> there are so many of these I don&#x27;t think I will ever run out. They are so much fun and add a lot to your nails. They arrived early so that was great.</li>
    <li> I use this product, in all my nail designs, simple , easy, and my clients&#x27; love them, will be ordering more , in the future!</li>
    <li> I have used these once since the purchase and will use again. I applied them with my top coat, maybe next time I will use a bonding glue to apply because I did not get the shine i wanted from them with the top coat. Items arrived quickly and was intact. I recommend product. There are different shapes in container which is a plus.</li>
    <li> I ordered this with nail art ideas in mind. Waited the 2weeks to get to my house. Was all happy to do my nails and I was lucky to have 100 all together. I didn&#x27;t do a review, I emailed them. They kindly answered my email and asked for a pic so I sent 2 made sure they got it. Got a email back from them saying how sorry they were and going to send me a bother one. (I offered to send this one back) was told didn&#x27;t need to. But it has been 6 1/2 weeks now, still no new one. So I have no choice but to leave a bad review. As for the rhinestones them selves are nice but didn&#x27;t get 20of any shape.. will not order from here any more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just what is expected. Stones work well too. I used nail polish to make them stick since I had no nail glue at the time, and they have not fallen off. Good product.</li>
    <li> Cell just as shown. And alot faster than it was supposed to. Excellent service.</li>
    <li> The reason I chose this item was because I have been wanting to use and get rhinestones to put on my nails because I think it gives the design and nail that extra WOW!! to the nail. I liked it for the most part. The only thing I did dislike about it was that they seem really small. I was expecting something a little bit bigger. But my overall satisfaction is great.</li>
    <li> Cute jewels pretty easy to work with but the lid slides easy so its easy for the jewles to fall out.</li>
    <li> Item as described! I love them! Just wish it wouldnt have taken so long to receive them.</li>
    <li> I like them ...there good</li>
    <li> Great deal and so sparkly.</li>
    <li> it helped me out with my nail business it was exactly what i was looking for</li>
    <li> They are plastic not real stones. don&#x27;t like then they fall off real easy.</li>
    <li> Very nice!  It arrived quickly and as advertised.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Cute silver rhinestones. They are very pretty on your fingers or toes which ever you preferred. Very cute and you will get compliments on it.</li>
    <li> This nail art wheel is super affordable and it has such a variety of fun shapes to choose from.  All shapes are fun and unique.  The shapes come all mixed up but it was really easy to arrange them.</li>
    <li> It was supposed to come with 12 different shapes, mine only came with tiny round gems.  Really disappointed in this item.</li>
    <li> This brands not bad.  I actually hardly use them because I like them more than any other rhinestones I&#x27;ve bought off amazon so I am trying to &amp;#34;preserve&amp;#34; them in a weird subconscious way.  They stay on better than other brands, but I could do with less crescent shapes and stars, more squares, circles and ovals.</li>
    <li> Not as big as i thought veryy tiny and most of mine are moon shaped booo i wanted star shape and heart but it will work i guess</li>
    <li> totally makes my nails look amazing! because polish and a design isn&#x27;t enough! and I didn&#x27;t pay over a dollar.. these things are wonderful! very small but very nice!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how many was in the wheel but I saw plenty for the money I spent and I wasn&#x27;t going to try and count them. This set is great for doing nail art because they are very dainty.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for all you have done for me. Good luck to you in future sales.&lt;br /&gt;Have a nice rest of the day&lt;br /&gt;goodbye</li>
    <li> These Rhinestones were a really good purchase. The container is much smaller than anticipated but the size of the stones are exactly what I needed. They are bigger than they look and the quality is better than most of what you get at the nail salon. Shipping is a little on the slow side since they come from China however, no regrets here.</li>
    <li> The rhinestones were thicker than I thought, so It comes off easily.. I had hard time trying to get those stones to stay,,,</li>
    <li> So perfect to play around with they are beautiful and well made I will advice to use gel top coat to keep brilliant glass like shine and if your using rhinestone too. But its up to you.</li>
    <li> I thought this product was much bigger. In the picture it looks as if the wheel is bigger then what it truly is. The diamonds do not look as if there is a lot in the wheel as the picture shows. I like that the diamonds came in a verity of sizes and shapes.</li>
    <li> For $0.13, you get a ridiculous number of gemstones that would run you about $20 or $30 here. As described and early. Very happy. I can afford to do my nail art and will be purchasing another one for my daughter who shares the same passion.</li>
    <li> they are pretty put on the nail, but the sizes are not the same, so you need to pick the same size when you use it.</li>
    <li> I just ordered this plus much more and I hhaven&#x27;t gotten them yet but I will do a review on my blog when I do. Follow and suscribe to me @ killertalk411.blog.com</li>
    <li> The quality is good, not super great though. The shapes are cute. And the product is shiny so I&#x27;m satisfied. Just as described.</li>
    <li> If you know how to apply then you will love these! Use a professional tool with these OR a toothpick. Have professional looking nails at home with these jewels. OR something I like to do is get my peti professionally done and when I get home I do the jewels myself. At the nail salon it is common to pay $1.00 PER JEWEL, so save yourself some money and DIY!</li>
    <li> Just what a girl needs last long , makes me happy and i love how i can create my own look with each and every gem :)</li>
    <li> Smaller than excepted but still great i used on my mom toe&lt;br /&gt;she loved it ad so did overall shipping was fast and great.:)</li>
    <li> I was going to use this to decorate my phone case but when I saw that it didn&#x27;t come with much and the rhinestones were too little, I decided not to use it for that and just for the nails. If only it came with the stated number of rhinestones, I could have done a lot with it but it did not so I gave it only three stars. The section of the wheel was barely filled not even to a quarter of each section which  was not how the picture showed but pictures can be deceiving. Overall, not a bad product, just know that you&#x27;re not getting as much rhinestones as you expect.</li>
    <li> This item arrived in the expected time. I don&#x27;t believe that there are 1200 of these rhinestones, only half. They are smaller than I  expected, not meant for toenails. I thought 2mm was a decent size for toenails.</li>
    <li> I like the wheel feature. My only complaint is that the title is misleading. I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase, but they are alright for what you pay.</li>
    <li> these are great for nail design they stayed on for at lest a week without falling off they go with any nail color</li>
    <li> A great deal of different shapes.  Great to use to make your own nail art work.  Love the different ways they can be used for nails,</li>
    <li> Def worth the price. Shipped quickly and it&#x27;s easy to use and looks cute!</li>
    <li> Great my wife loves it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally inexpensive for the value you obtain for it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a very smart purchase, I hope we can do business in future</li>
    <li> This is my first ever comment on amazon, and the reason that motivates me enough to do this is that for a second time i&#x27;ve received what i did not ask from overseas sellers, and i&#x27;m really pissed about it because there&#x27;s no way i&#x27;ll return something so cheap to wait a whole month for a seller i&#x27;ll never be in contact with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the &amp;#34;RHINESTONE PACK OF 11200&amp;#34; and i got hardly a 500 pack of pearl looking pieces of plastic, which i sooo didn&#x27;t want to order cuz i just simply don&#x27;t like &#x27;em, so that being said &amp;#34;DO NOT BE SURPRISED IF AFTER YOU READ THIS COMMENT AND STILL GO FOR THE PURCHASE THE SAME THING HAPPENS TO YOU&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;(Gave it one star cuz i have to in order to write this comment down).</li>
    <li> Well, even though it may be obvious, this pack here is a bunch of material for such a small price. What else could you ask for?</li>
    <li> I love my nail art crystal!&lt;br /&gt;is really nice.  I would say it look bigger photo, but it was small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but is nice.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> They are smaller then I expected. But ure differs aren&#x27;t but so big so they should do the trick just fine. It looks the same as in the picture and are very cute.</li>
    <li> The only thing that I would have to warn anyone about is that this container is much smaller than it seems</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nail technician and these rhinestones are of excellent quality and they were a great price compared to some I would get at my local beauty supply. I only wish there were some larger and some smaller rhinestones in the pack.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described in description. Thank you&lt;br /&gt;I really liked all the different shapes and sizes Thanks again good product.</li>
    <li> Not that great very empty quality was cheap but I guess for the price I should not be picky would not order again</li>
    <li> ok so i was surpised that the stones care different shapes, i can&#x27;t wait to play with these, you can get super creative</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this! I got this item incredibly fast, and it is inexpensive. What more would you ask for? Well packaged and all of the little stones appear to be there (too many to count, lol). Will definetely order from them again.</li>
    <li> Cute kit, nice selection!</li>
    <li> great value for the money</li>
    <li> Shipping was quite long. But item was great!</li>
    <li> WoW Excellent~~ Thank You so much! A++++-+</li>
    <li> When tray arrived the jewels were jumbled.  They become very cloudy when placed.</li>
    <li> I got the item really quickly. They are automatically separated and I love all of the different shapes. Some of the rhinestones are stuck together so you have to be careful when using them. They stick on easily and I picked them up with a toothpick. I put them on my nails with just a top coat a week ago and they are still on there and they are still shining. This is really worth the money.</li>
    <li> Theses are okay gems for your nails, not as many as there was suppose to be but the price was still okay</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a tomboy was looking for something that&#x27;s  a cool add on to my girlfriend new obsession about doing her nails. I received them faster then I expected, opened up the package to fall head over heels for this accessory!!! I could clearly see there wasn&#x27;t the right amount but way more then I read on these bad reviews.. I even took some out and realize they are a good small size and yet noticeable to stand out from a distance. I know I will buy some more at this price !</li>
    <li> These are so much fun.  You can&#x27;t  go wrong.</li>
    <li> its alot of stones cant complain</li>
    <li> This is really good, the rhinestone are really cute, and the quality are much better than other stones I bought, it is much fuller than them, I mean the account.</li>
    <li> It was fine and happy with the sparkles. It was part of a package and the price was right, ok.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy. Satisfied customer :)</li>
    <li> Great bright colors. Very shiny and small addictions for your nails. I love it when added on tip and top of nails. Great price small in size.</li>
    <li> Thank you for sending on time and I am so very glad that it was what I needed it made it easy for me</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Shipping was faster than expected.</li>
    <li> LOVE! I can put them on more than just my nails and does! Decked out a cell phone case with them too!</li>
    <li> Crystals arrived earlier than expected, almost 2 weeks before and since it was free shipping, it was a great deal for the price.  The crystals are beautiful, and have many different shapes. Theyalso have several different sizes, from tiny ones to fairly good small size.  I love the butterflies and the hearts. Cannot wait to use them. The wheel container is very sturdy and they do not mix with each other. I recommend this product and this seller.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected, but still a good deal for the money.</li>
    <li> These are cute and trendy, and there are plenty of shapes for different designs. The only problem I saw with these is that when I painted over them with clear polish, they didn&#x27;t really shine as much. Otherwise, they&#x27;re awesome and make your nails super fab (until they fall off).</li>
    <li> Cute but very small,I like them but may not use much because so very smal you can&#x27;t tell what they look like. They are nice!</li>
    <li> I love all the different shapes I can decorate my nails with. Some of them are a little thicker than I hoped and tend to stick out around the edges, therefore prone to snagging on something and coming off but I can make them work. Pleased with this purchase. :)</li>
    <li> in my opinion they were really ugly. Maybe like half are nice and usable but the other half look defective(as in 2 stuck together or have additional plastic pieces attached to it) i gave them to my little nieces to use and they liked them.</li>
    <li> The wheel took a while to ship here, but i understand it will take longer the further you are away from the producers. The wheel IS VERY SMALL!! About as big as the base of a water bottle. The gems were sort of mixed up and out of place.</li>
    <li> For the price, the rhinestones are not bad but it clearly indicates in the product description that different shapes and sizes are included. What I received was round crystal rhinestone of the same size, nothing like the picture shows.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to come with 1200 rhinestones, however I only got 337. I would like to know where the other 863 rhinestones are that I bought. I read the reviews and noticed that more people didn&#x27;t get the amount listed, so I decided to count mine and was angered to find out I did not get all that I payed for. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> Very tiny, and hard to stick on with out a dotting tool, nevertheless they are very cute and shiny, wont buy again though</li>
    <li> great product and really easy to work with if you have the right tools.I was very pleased with my product</li>
    <li> These are so cute and so pretty. I love them. I use them all the time and the price was great for them.</li>
    <li> Not to many round ones but a ton of other shapes. Quality not bad. The wheel itself is about 3&amp;#34;wide.</li>
    <li> Love doing my nails myself and these just add some sparkle to them</li>
    <li> Love these! I love that there are different shapes. They stay on the nails great and i love using them. People always love the extra pop! Would definitely get more. This is my honest review.</li>
    <li> I have yet to use them but im already in love with them , they are small pieces which is great cause i could fit them on my nails nicely</li>
    <li> Great styles. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> They are very thin.  I had to work carefully in order to not drop the container. The stones are nice. I thought I was getting different shapes, but it only included on kind.</li>
    <li> These are absolutely PERFECT.  small size works perfect for small natually cuved nails.  I the variety is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moons, Stars, Tears, Triangles, Squares, Clover and a few others.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only negative is my case didn&#x27;t seem to contain as many moons as the other items, but still great.  I will purchase more.</li>
    <li> It was what I expected. Just little smaller tho.but good for the price. Very shiny and different shapes to switch up with</li>
    <li> It is what i expected.. a bit of waiting for delivery, but you cant beat the price. woth the money</li>
    <li> February 1, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although they advertise \\&quot;Pack of 1200\\&quot; there are definitely not more than 500. They came all mixed up in the 12 slot plastic organizer/storage disc, (i.e. finding stars in the place where there&#x27;s mostly moons, and moons in teardrops and squares). I tried to shake it up and see if shipping caused the mixing of the different rhinestones, but they didn&#x27;t mix up more; therefore they mixed up the shapes upon filling the disc at their factory. I have counted a few of the lesser filled slots, and all of the mostly filled up slots. Each slot has 20-30 rhinestones, placing the total rhinestones in this package to..... 240 to 360.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this when it was 90% off, I would not purchased this if it had a higher price, and I do not suggest paying more than $2 for it. The \\&quot;rhinestones\\&quot; are of good quality, but clearly made out of plastic and not crystals or glass. (I expect rhinestones to be made out of crystals or glass, otherwise they should call them plastic gems.) The shapes that are the traditional gem shape, (i.e. square, rectangle, circle, teardrop) have nice cuts in them that make them sparkle and shine well in the light, but the other shapes (i.e. curved rain drop, moon, butterfly, flower) are not cut like a gem and do not sparkle, they just have the silver lining to shine. When one fell off my nail the silver backing still stuck to my nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I doubt you could even fit 1200 pieces into this tiny disc. I&#x27;m glad I received something fun for my nails, but let this be a warning to others who might try to purchase this for their business/salon. There is under 400 \\&quot;rhinestones\\&quot; total, and there is not an evenly matched quantity across the 12 different shapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tweezers worked just fine to pick up and place them on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still waiting for this company&#x27;s disc of \\&quot;1200 pearls\\&quot; to arrive, which I expect the same results from. Thanks for reading this far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 12, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still waiting...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 5, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still waiting....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 7, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up being tired of waiting, and submitted a claim to Amazon. I am not satisfied with this product at all by now. They promptly credited my account for the amount paid for the product. Thank you Amazon. Also, the pearl version mentioned earlier ended up being fine. I think this is a \\&quot;hit or miss\\&quot; company with their products.</li>
    <li> Not what i expected the wheel is extremely small. There&#x27;s is no way there are many diamonds as advertised. Buy from a different vendor.</li>
    <li> love these gems! always good for nail art!</li>
    <li> Great, looks pretty, the hearts are not as heart shaped but still they are really nice. It adds bling to your nails.!!</li>
    <li> package arrived broken and all charms were mixed up and looked like left over pieces. Most charmes were broken, guess thats ok for abstrat nail art.</li>
    <li> The product is poorly made and what I received in the mail does not match what I ordered online or the description.  It also took a ridiculous amount of time to arrive. The shapes are very vaguely visible due to the poor quality.</li>
    <li> these are so gorgeous :)</li>
    <li> great for the nail art you can do plenty to choose from</li>
    <li> These were a great deal for the price. I don&#x27;t think it has thousands but there are a lot of gems.</li>
    <li> I love all the different shapes they give you! They give you so many of each too, I love creating so many designs. I will deff be buying again!!</li>
    <li> They fall off within three days. I don&#x27;t get it. Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong. They are difficult to set, and putting top coat over them does not help. Maybe I&#x27;m just too rough with my nails. They are pretty however, but I&#x27;m thinking it was not really worth the 90 cents and two month wait on shipping from china :-(</li>
    <li> step mom loved them (: if shes happy im happy</li>
    <li> Very pretty. Great price.</li>
    <li> I received my wheel before estimated time  along with an unbeatable price...the stones are ok different shapes but they are not as shine as the picture shows and eventually the little shine it has it will go away...you wont be able to see they stones on your nails specially with that color or over designs</li>
    <li> These are fantastic! I can&#x27;t wait to start using them for my nail art. They came really early from the arrival date. I would purchase these again.</li>
    <li> To small thought it was going to be bigger but I guess not. Not what I thought it was smh</li>
    <li> this came broken/defective and with half the number of gemstones as described. Also, the &amp;#34;gemstones&amp;#34; are not really gemstones but just shiny cardboard.</li>
    <li> Do not recommend this product. Not sure how everyone elses experience went with this product but I personally got sent a very tiny package of golden star nail gems and NO silver gems. After waiting for over a month I was pretty disappointed to receive the wrong product.</li>
    <li> Great price and received before the due date!!  Going to use this item on greeting cards!  Small and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> The quality of these could be better but I guess you get what you pay for. It&#x27;s okay though, for the price.</li>
    <li> This item is a great idea for nail art! Great for a girls night or any object that requires a little bling!!</li>
    <li> These are very tiny.  Not sure what to do with them yet but I&#x27;m sure the kids will like them.</li>
    <li> i love my diamonds and other shapes decals for nails.. it took a lil while but i love them. although they where all mixed up in the plastic disc.. i still got my item. ty i appriciate it.. i will order again</li>
    <li> I like these, and they seem to be good quality, but the way the numbers are distributed is weird. There are a lot of round ones which is good, but only a few stars. There is a lot of kidney shaped ones, but only a few triangles. I will order again, but I wish I would have known beforehand.</li>
    <li> FELL OFF DIDNT LAST LONG</li>
    <li> these are awesome.... I really like these little gems because they surely will add some bling bling to my finger nail tips when I get them done..... I love them ....</li>
    <li> Easy to use dial yet some of the art is mixed in other holes, so you have to pay attention to what you shake out. Not a big deal. I used the art the same day I received my package. I enjoyed having a variety of jewels to pick from</li>
    <li> Love these so much. Little shapes and they are easy to use. Would buy these again. Great for little designs.</li>
    <li> I really liked these so did my daughter. Shipping was a lot faster than expected. The amount maybe off was not as many as I thought but they are nice and will work well for what we needed them for.</li>
    <li> As described. Great price.</li>
    <li> They are pretty good  for the price!</li>
    <li> Way too small.  Tiny package and tiny rhinestones.  There isn&#x27;t an easy way to get them out of the packaging without spilling them all over the place.</li>
    <li> Exactly as shown great price</li>
    <li> These are great. I love this product so much. I love using the gems on my nails. Packaging could be better cause it does spill</li>
    <li> I like the variety of stones. Lots of fun</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re okay but they came packaged all out of order, so I rearranged them before I took the picture. It says 1200 pieces or something and it&#x27;s clearly nowhere even close to that number. It says 12 designs, but I only got 9 (rectangle, star, flower, circle, weird teardrop, square, teardrop, triangle, and some other weird one) and then I got one heart shaped rhinestone and three crescent moon rhinestones. I got so many star shaped rhinestones that I had to put some in another compartment. It&#x27;s a good price, but they&#x27;re falsely advertising and don&#x27;t even give you what they assure you that you&#x27;ll get.</li>
    <li> Great vendor highly recommend</li>
    <li> Thank you!I like it!!!</li>
    <li> Came much sooner then estimated :-)</li>
    <li> These are not terribly brilliant, but at the same time, for the price, they are great.  If you like a crystal on your nail art now and then, these will work for you.  Great variety of shapes and each slot is very full.</li>
    <li> the size of the jewels are a bit bigger than what the pic looks like but they&#x27;re worth it (its only because I like really tiny jewels for my nails)</li>
    <li> They were all mixed up in the container. Some were even broken in half. Also there were a lot of some shapes and then hardly any of others. This was lame.</li>
    <li> i really wasnt satisfied. i was expecting to have more crystals, there was definately not 1200 of them in this wheel that i had ordered., but for a cheap price... not so worried</li>
    <li> I have read before some of the other reviews and was a little skeptical to buy them. Luckily they arrived and my fears went away as soon as I saw them. It is true that they are a little smaller than expected but once on the nails they look cute.</li>
    <li> Lots of different shapes! They are tiny and cute.  I haven&#x27;t used them yet. There&#x27;s just so many shapes I don&#x27;t know where to start. I think I&#x27;ll put one of each on one of my nails.</li>
    <li> Shipment was super fast! These are very adorable for all ages to have fun with nail art! At this buy, I bought a few!! Enjoy as I have been :)</li>
    <li> great price great product!!! just like the nail salon!!!!!! all you need to get is the rhinestone clear nail polish and your go to go</li>
    <li> I love all bling, and this is perfect. All kind of shapes and sizes. the possabilities are endless. These will last a long time ans what a great deal</li>
    <li> I loved all the little shapes and sizes and I just hope that it is 1200&lt;br /&gt;Pieces and I would count them but I really don&#x27;t have time for that.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and the little container they come in works great as&lt;br /&gt;Well and none of the rhinestones have fallen out.</li>
    <li> These are not premium quality at all as stated for this item. The different shaped rhinestones didn&#x27;t arrive all inside its own compartment. I had to lose some because it was caught in between the spinning wheel. These may look sparkly but once you apply it to nails with clear top coat it gets dull. Looks like cheap plastic. I would not recommend it for nail art. Guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Poor quality product. They are actually not rhinestones, its just silver plastic pieces with bad finish. But then this is what you will get for the price paid.</li>
    <li> it was not what i thought it was... as for the quality its not premium...ill use but will not reorder</li>
    <li> love love these they will last me a long time!!! so pretty for more pop to your nails and fun to use very happy!!!!</li>
    <li> Thumbs up: delivery&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs down: none thus far&lt;br /&gt;I would probably reorder</li>
    <li> These are a gift for a teen who loves to do her nails. Looks like a lot of pieces. You can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> I ordered it October 12th and received it October 28th, the estimated was November 5th. So that was a big plus. The stones are in different shapes and sizes but are perfect for nails ! Not 1200 but still a great price for the stuff!(:</li>
    <li> Works but the rhinestones were mix</li>
    <li> Cheaply made. When it came it was all mixed together and there&#x27;s no way there&#x27;s 1200 pieces!! Very unhappy</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use this yet.  But there is a good variety.  And the container they came in does a decent job keeping them segregated.  I did notice that some of the shapes have some that are distorted.</li>
    <li> ENDED UP BUYING SEVERAL NAIL ITEMS FOR A FRIEND WHOS STARTING HER SMALL BUSINESS AND SHE LOVED IT</li>
    <li> This little wheel has so many gems you never seem to run out! It&#x27;s perfect for playing around with your nails blinging them out for all kinds of designs.</li>
    <li> bought these on behalf of my daughter.  she loves making ornaments with photos in them and adding gems to give them just the right touch</li>
    <li> VERY NICE PRODUCT A LITTLE SMALL BUT THE PRICE IS PERFECT. TAKES A LITTLE OVER 2 WEEKS TO GET IT.</li>
    <li> The photo in the add shows rhinestones in different shapes and sizes, however, when I received mine, the stones were all the same (circular).  Very disappointed, but not worth sending back.  I can still use them as they are still nice rhinestones, but they are definitely not what is in the picture.</li>
    <li> I pretty much got wat i ordered. Came in before the delivery date  !! I havent try them but im sure they are gonna look wonderfull. I dod not count them and im not gonna trip if i dint get the full amount for the price is worth it.</li>
    <li> Grandaughter loves it.</li>
    <li> Very misleading and I did NOT receive 1200 pieces. I received 246 to be exact. The wheel is about 2 inches across the widest part, something didn&#x27;t look right there....so I counted them. Granted, you get what you pay for, but this is outrageous. I am going to contact the company immediately. I do a lot of nail art and am highly disappointed with this purchase. If you advertise a certain amount, there should be that amount in the wheel.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. I couldn&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it was. I was at a loss what to buy her until I saw this. I knew that she would have fun using this with my grand daughter.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Good quality. They don&#x27;t stay in the holder though. They fall out.</li>
    <li> as the title says, they were ok. (I only needed the circles) But, when I got them, 1 wheel of gems were completely gone and some were half missing!!!</li>
    <li> the quality is not very good, you get a lot in the containers. different shapes for different nail designs. not the best</li>
    <li> My bad I didn&#x27;t notice that the stone were different shapes.  Majority of my clients will not use the unusal stones but for the price it works</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Smaller than I thought but for price a great deal and very pretty!</li>
    <li> I like the wheel where these rhinestone come, it&#x27; pretty helpful and the rhinestones are pretty? I haven&#x27;t use it yet. All I can say is that it came fast and nicely wrapped</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t flat, so every time you hit it off something, it falls off. Not messing with these anymore.They are cute. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> not as shown in photo. the container is practically empty. i ordered 2 and they are both very empty- not like this misleading photo. the stones are nice and carious sizes, just very few to choose from</li>
    <li> These a really cute ,i just thought the wheel would be bigger but i still love these.</li>
    <li> Very cheap quality, but that&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t have to pay much. Please be advised that you will need to buy an additional tweezer-like object to place these rhinestones on precisely.</li>
    <li> Not even close to 1200 pieces. MAYBE 300, but not even close to 1200 like the description says. The reason I ordered it was because it listed that many pieces. It&#x27;s also smaller than I expected, but what I received is NOT what was listed. Getting 1/4 of what you pay for isn&#x27;t right!</li>
    <li> Just got them but I believe that it&#x27;s less then 1200</li>
    <li> came with stars, moons, ovals, squares, and a variety of other silver rhinestones perfect for nails!</li>
    <li> Ended up spilling it all over because the container is crap and didnt even properly spin</li>
    <li> love it  thank you so much</li>
    <li> Perfect for making random designs and flowers! Love them, FYI they are super tiny! Got several compliments on my first nail design.</li>
    <li> Not as nice as other brands</li>
    <li> Fun Nail rhinestones.  Good value for the money</li>
    <li> These are pretty and they got here in two weeks, but there is no more than maybe 400 in here.</li>
    <li> Take a min to receive but i like them</li>
    <li> the date said that I wasn&#x27;t going to get it till September 14 but I got it on August 4!  AWESOME!!! also it comes with a lot!!!</li>
    <li> kids love it, hard to get on nails...use tweezers it helps</li>
    <li> I received these sooner than expected. They were slightly smaller than expected and my stones were a tad bit out of place but they are adorable and will work well with the nail art I&#x27;m trying to achieve!! I think this is a great deal considering the prices of 1/3 just plain old round crystals at my local beauty supply. They come in bows,hearts,triangles , raindrops, squares , oh the variety!! I am extremely satisfied with this product!!</li>
    <li> I thought there would be more for each shape. It comes with like maybe 15-20 in each.</li>
    <li> Ordered Dec30, estimated shipping Jan25, arrived Jan11.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not 1200, but 12,shapes&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t complain for two bucks</li>
    <li> Got them very quickly, but they&#x27;re not organized at all, but hey, it gave me something to do. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a different type of rhinestone in each slot, and they aren&#x27;t super tiny, so if you&#x27;re looking for something smaller this might not be what you&#x27;re looking for. But they&#x27;re really nice.</li>
    <li> Almost empty, waiting for refund or replacement</li>
    <li> I like that this product was filled like it shows. Some of these they sell in the stores only have about 10  gems per section. But this is packed full!</li>
    <li> the packs of crystals were very nice. i ordered them as fun gifts for my five grandaughters. they loved using the crystals on their nails and made many designs with them</li>
    <li> I was happy when I got this little wheel. The rhinestones are nice sizes and are all so very different so it was nice to have all that variety. The only thing I had trouble with was that the rhinestones weren&#x27;t perfectly separated but I guess that&#x27;s fine since I can just find them on my own. Another thing was that I had trouble turning the top to access the rhinestones because they were getting caught at the top making it harder to rotate.</li>
    <li> Very cute but only 240 stones&lt;br /&gt;20 in each,I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Super fun and super cute. I love putting these on my nails. Make for fun times with younger siblings or children, even teens.</li>
    <li> took about a month to get here you need tweezers to put on very tiny pieces very hard to use</li>
    <li> Rhinestones were only in one shape. The only reason why I ordered was because it states &amp;#34;different shapes&amp;#34;. I am very disappointed</li>
    <li> Love love love them!!!! Thank you so much. I thought it was just one single design but they were all different types made me smile even more...lol</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, what I received was not what I ordered. Product is supposed to be different shapes, but like another reviewer or two or three, I only received a package of round ones. Disappointed, was looking forward to having the different shapes, as I have plenty of the plain round type.</li>
    <li> The gems came in all different colors and shapes not just clear stones like was pictured and in the description.</li>
    <li> You get a ton for the price!</li>
    <li> I use these nail art mo you silver moon they  look great on the nail I get complements</li>
    <li> its ok... but wont order again</li>
    <li> Definitely not the amount stated and there are some copies in the same pack. But overall it was worth the change I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Kids live! Great for arts and crafts</li>
    <li> I got what it says, although, I don&#x27;t know if there is as many gems as it says. Looks a little empty to me.. also, there&#x27;s alot of static in the 0lastic, so pieces are &amp;#34;floating&amp;#34; and when you try to turn, might get stuck. Other then that, it&#x27;s great for the price.</li>
    <li> My pre-teen loves theses, she has added them to her nails, phone, books, ipod, mirror &amp; she even put some on a pair of sunnies we have alike :)</li>
    <li> like rhinestones just not as any as in picture</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I use it all the time</li>
    <li> nice sizes, cuite decotations,</li>
    <li> These are pretty but probably more three-dimensional than you are expecting. They are quite thick for what they are.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the quantity and quality of the product. Delivery date was on point. Overall  I&#x27;m very satisfied!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soooo small! The diamonds are even smaller, it&#x27;s hard to work with.</li>
    <li> Not as shiny once you put them on your nail</li>
    <li> These are pretty cute, and there is a good amount of gems in the little wheel. They are a little bit cheap looking but you can&#x27;t expect the world when you pay so little. I recommend! You can make a lot of creations with these little fellas.</li>
    <li> Very cute tiny little psck, cute container cannot beat the price great for arts and crafts, I recommend it cute</li>
    <li> This is perfect. Exactly what I was looking for and for a great price too. So happy I found this seller and product. I use them for my finger and toe nails. A friend of mine found this same product for twice as much in a local store. Very</li>
    <li> Add said they were different shapes and sizes but the were all the same size... Wish the add would have specified the size...</li>
    <li> terrible not even rhinestones they look so cheap and plastic not to mention microscopic! don&#x27;t waste you money on this junk</li>
    <li> these are very blingin and sparkley on my acrylic nails. Comes in different shapes, hearts, stars, bows, triangles, rectangles, circles, flowers.. endless design capability. i got my package pretty fast too! i definately am happy with this purchase and will buy from this seller again. thanks!</li>
    <li> The case they&#x27;re in is so tiny. All the jewels are extremely small. This is not what I was expecting at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I got these and I think I love them!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay at all so disappointed I wish I can give no star</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, considering it comes from overseas. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> The took a bit to get here, but once they did, I was in heaven. They are so pretty!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my nail kit or any nail kit, or anything to do with art etc. For me it&#x27;s nails but I may end up using it with makeup.</li>
    <li> Not as expected hard to apply these rhinestone</li>
    <li> Nice mix of shapes...I especially love the little bow crystals! Very small so they look nice on your nails, not overpowering or too gaudy.</li>
    <li> they are great but very hard to remove. I only put then on with nail polish.</li>
    <li> This was what I wanted, even though for some reason I thought it would be bigger. But, I never ordered nail gems before, so I did not  know what the sizes are normally.</li>
    <li> I love them but when they arrived the box was semi open and the different shapes of sparkles were mixed up. So I had to actually separate them myself. Well that&#x27;s how I know that they were way less than 1200, but the quantity I got was ok for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Also they are not rhinestones but a thin silver sheet with some glass like material over them for shine.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly speaking applying Rhinestones on nails would lead to you scratching your face by the surface of rhinestones so this was fine.&lt;br /&gt;One last thing, I am a working professional and actually used them only once. Nothing bad with the product but the nails just didn&#x27;t match my attire. But am definitely going to use them for my vacations :)</li>
    <li> I love these, so shiny.  Perfect size for nails!  I was given a wheel full of different shapes.  Stars, moons, hearts, triangles, circles, tear drops, squares, butterflies, bows, rectangles, oval and flowers.  I used just a tacky top coat, placed them on, let dry a few minutes then pained another top coat on and they stayed shiny.  They are not glass or stone of any type, just plastic but for me they work and no one knows but me.</li>
    <li> I am really into nail art. This Rhinestone Pack is so cool! There are moons, stars, butterflies, bows and hearts, just to name a few. They are super tiny and fit perfectly on child or adult nails. It comes in a wheel and each different shape is in a different compartment. you turn the top to the section you want and pour out the &amp;#34;rhinestones&amp;#34;. Can&#x27;t wait to use these on my next design.</li>
    <li> The expected arrival time was way later than it actually came (it came about two weeks earlier) however the info says 1200 but the pack was not even 1000... they still cute and I&#x27;m getting tons of complements on my nails so I guess I shouldn&#x27;t bee too upset that they lied</li>
    <li> It took a while to get in the mail and the top was cracked a bit, but still works fine. Some of the gems are sort of big, but there are plenty tiny ones to work with and I like it a lot. Definitely worth the $1.49!</li>
    <li> as promised - tho there looks like about half as many gems in person i am going to take their word for it and assume there are 1200.</li>
    <li> Okay for the price paid....ordered it for my niece...have not opened the packet yet...but it looks good and important thing is that it arrived on time:)</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to start having lots of fun creating some sparkly nail art. Love all the different shapes and sizes!</li>
    <li> Much smaller than I was expecting, and clearly far fewer gems than advertised, but they&#x27;re very cute and easy to apply. Easily disorganized, however, but the cute designs make up for it.</li>
    <li> Great Nail Bling , at a great price. Great seller and product.</li>
    <li> It has different shapes and sizes it a lot of design I can do with it and fun and creative. It like the picture</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery, arrived almost 2 whole weeks ahead of schedule. The wheel seems like it&#x27;s good quality, it held up through shipping, all of the gemstones are in their compartment on the wheel. I haven&#x27;t counted them, but maybe not 1200, but still beyond worth the buy. At my local beauty store it&#x27;s $20 for 20 gemstones this size, and that doesn&#x27;t include a store and sort wheel.</li>
    <li> I just received these so i have not tried them out yet so sorry i will let you know when i try them out.</li>
    <li> These were even smaller than I expected them to be, but to me it&#x27;s a good thing because I didn&#x27;t want huge rhinestones! There are 12 different little shapes and I loooove the little flower. Theres circles, teardrops, triangles, different circles, ovals, flowers, stars, squares, hearts, small circles, rectangles and a weird oval type shape. They&#x27;re just cute and I love them!</li>
    <li> They can be used for anything and everything for the right glue. I&#x27;ve used them on nails, decorated my phone case, and other crafts.</li>
    <li> So I get my nails done regularly I took them to the shop and needles to say no sparkle they look like plastic dots afterwards</li>
    <li> You get what you paid for. I thought it was very cheap for a 1200 piece. I think I could have found a better deal by going to actual stores. You could tell the product was cheaply made and I was disappointed, because I was actually looking for circle crystals but there were only 5 pieces of circles... Most of it was moon-shaped.</li>
    <li> These are different sizes and shapes. If you only want standard circle rhinestones then this is not the one you want to purchase. I personally find a use for everything I have so this is why I like these.</li>
    <li> kids loved it an are having fun with it, just gotta keep them in 1 area lol so th dnt spill all over</li>
    <li> I love these, they are very sparkly and the perfect size. Lots of different shapes! It arrived very quick too. The one I ordered at the same time thru Mash still hasn&#x27;t arrived</li>
    <li> It comes in a cute little package and its easy to use. Just make sure you don&#x27;t let little kids get to this. I would recommend this product for older teens and adults.</li>
    <li> Cute different sizes, different patterns, but you def., need tweezers! I love the cute looks you can make with these.</li>
    <li> Loved them, so many different shapes. Got them for add ons to our nails for my sisters wedding, SHE LOVES THEM :)</li>
    <li> But appreciate support and instant contact..we will see. Hopeful to see it soon. I am looking forward to seeing what I get</li>
    <li> I have used them in just about every manicure I have done since getting them! I have used them in designs and as simple accents either placed in the center or top of my nail near the cuticle. I love that you get 3 different sizes! I get lots of compliments. I love them! Will definitely order more when I run out, and they are going quick! Shipping did take as long as projected (I think about 3 weeks) but given where they came from, and the price, it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
    <li> the rhinestones itself are not as shiny as others out there but there are alot of them in the wheel. when these came in the mail i thought i was going to get what was advertised (assorted sizes and shapes), these are all one size and one shape- the seller is resending me another wheel (kudos to them for taking care of this) so when item comes in mail, i will have to update my review.</li>
    <li> very nice! took awhile to ship though.</li>
    <li> As it was described, beautiful and comes earlier than was expected.</li>
    <li> this is so perfect! best product i could find for my nail art needs &amp; best price too - nail art gems at local shops are wayy overpriced. i was worried they might be too big for my tiny nails but the size is perfect. my order shipped &amp; arrived very quickly. good size, cute shapes, easy to apply &amp; design, and nice packaging too. it doesn&#x27;t seem like there are 1200 pieces though - that&#x27;s the only reason i gave it 4/5 stars. the shapes were a bit out of place in my wheel as well, but i don&#x27;t really mind.</li>
    <li> I love painting and fixing up my nails, and wanted to try these out. They&#x27;re small, plastic pieces with a silver backing to make them shine. All the different shapes were in their correct &amp;#34;compartment&amp;#34; and the package arrived on time in perfect shape. While these aren&#x27;t the best quality rhinestones you can find out there, for the price, they&#x27;re amazing and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Came really fast , and I love them</li>
    <li> excellent product I recommend</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.  They are great.</li>
    <li> The wheel is smaller then I thought it would be but whatever, they look nice enough. Its hard to tell what shapes all come in it because the photo isn&#x27;t that great but there are stars, crescents, regular round stones, rectangular, asymmetrical drops, squares, hearts, flowers, triangles, drops, and two sets of oval ones.</li>
    <li> They came in a plastic bag, not a wheel.  But otherwise, exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Nice an beautiful nail art</li>
    <li> it was&#x27;nt 1200 in the case but it was ok</li>
    <li> A little big and bulkier and more plastic-y than I had hoped for.. not bad. just not great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smaller than the picture. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it but I can say that there are a bunch of possibilities of making things. It&#x27;s awesome. They are all very shiny and eye catching.</li>
    <li> These did very well on my nails! I really like them. They must be good because my Daughter is always in them. These are very shiny and just nice little nail additions to any kit</li>
    <li> Worked out fine. The only thing I noticed was that it lost its shine when I used it with super glue.</li>
    <li> Tons of jewels, haven&#x27;t used them yet but they are what I asked for!</li>
    <li> The product is wayyy smaller than u think. It is a good product, but small. Think about when u go to like walmart or happy Harry&#x27;s and they have all their nail stuff together. Now look at the nail stuff for Ithaca bury kids... that&#x27;s how small these gems are, as small as those ones. They are okay other than size. They are .1 kg :D have a good day.</li>
    <li> so beautiful!!!!! i thought it was just going to be dots but it was starss and hearts  such a variety!!!!!!! so pretty u should def get this!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very easy transaction. Item was just as described!</li>
    <li> Very tiny; hard to get a hold of. They do stick to your nails pretty good.</li>
    <li> My daughter love these</li>
    <li> Excellent! Tweezer ready &amp; easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Good product, received as described and ahead of schedule.</li>
    <li> I found the rhinestones a bit big (in thickness) for my nails</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use this crystal during Chistmas and New Year&#x27;s Eve &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Ok I gave this three stars for one reason the gems stick up on your nails and get caught on everything I&#x27;m not likening this item at all a waste of money if u ask me</li>
    <li> This are the perfect size for nail art. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is the little pieces float around the container so they get kind of mixed up.</li>
    <li> Has incredible variety of shapes, some of which I didn&#x27;t instantly recognize (tear drop, baguette and paisley shapes) . Had no idea there could be this kind of variety! They are very small and it&#x27;s somewhat difficult to decern the shape on the nail which are the only reason they don&#x27;t get a full 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This shipped quickly considering the distance it traveled. Perfect for me b/c I enjoy doing my nails at home. Thanks for the reasonable price too :)</li>
    <li> Sent to my nieces for Christmas as they are older and into the bling thing.  I am sure they will LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome products, just wish it was a little quicker ship time but thanks anyway!!! I will reorder when needed, thanks again</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> They are ok. All different shapes. I only expected them to be round. My mistake</li>
    <li> Very cute gems! I live the different shapes and sizes. I love doing nails and these were a great addition to my nail art! I will definitely buy more!</li>
    <li> This is not what I was expecting .-.</li>
    <li> Very cheap and cheaply made!</li>
    <li> Yippy, more nail glam. Wonderful Thankx.</li>
    <li> The designs are so cute! I am a huge fan of nail art and I love adding gems. It&#x27;s nice to have them in shapes instead of just the tiny gems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside, there are definitely NOT 1200 gems in the case. I doubt there are even 1000 in there, and there is not an equal amount of each design.</li>
    <li> Some of the shapes are cut well, but some are cut very poorly and they are not shiny or sparkly which the picture gave the impression of.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t got this purchase so I don&#x27;t know if there any good or not maybe they will come one day</li>
    <li> awesome nail product and they look great i was a little surprised how small the container is but its still a great product and i received it before the estimated delivery date ;)</li>
    <li> This order came quickly and was exactly what I expected.  It came within 2 weeks of ordering.  The only negative comment I can make is that there are not 1200 rhinestones, but for the price I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
    <li> So many choices I cant decide...I wish this came in with a variety of colors, but this will do for now. I thought it was a great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> the only thing i guess i would have to complain about it was that when i opened the package all the rhinestones were in different compartments, which made it hard to find the same ones, but other than that amazing and sooo cute!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found these. If you are bored with just having the traditional circle rhinstone I would highly suggest getting this pack. There are moons and stars; hearts and circles. There are also other shapes but those are the fancier ones. They have a nice sparkle to them and are not dull even after a coat of clear polish. The polish doesn&#x27;t affect the rhinstones. I have had the heart ones on for a week now and have gotten so many compliments on my manicure. I will most definitely buy these again and again. They also are not huge but perfect manicure size and would even look nice on younger girls hands due to their size.</li>
    <li> Cute rhinestone but some had small pieces of plastic which were not file down, but for the price it was a good product</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re beautiful, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting the packaging to be so small...I feel like I could&#x27;ve gotten this item at my local dollar store. Good price though.</li>
    <li> I thought it they were just going to be different sized circles. They had so many different shapes I&#x27;m glad I got them. my nails look awesome, and I also bling up my shoes ;)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the picture fool you! I thought the gems and overall product would be bigger but the container is so tiny that it fits in the palm of my hand. The gems are tiny that I can barely tell wat the shap of it is!</li>
    <li> The shapes were cut very well. I like that I got so much variety for not that much money! I would repurchase from them anytime!</li>
    <li> Very low quality, also I only got the circular rhinestones which that&#x27;s not what the description says: &amp;#34; in 12 different shapes and sizes&amp;#34;!!&lt;br /&gt;I am a lit disappointed! I would not recommend this!</li>
    <li> My 16 year old daughter loves to have her nails done, either at a salon, or at home by me or herself.  She loves sparkly things and will love these!</li>
    <li> I love for my nails and the nails I do to pop and be seen from a mile away this product will definitly give yiou that effect.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!! Diamonds are a gals best friend..haha</li>
    <li> I understand that you get what you pay for. But I have purchased Rhinestones from Amazon before (for the same price), and they were fantastic!!! I figured it was time to re-up and I ordered these. First off, it took about 6 weeks for me to get this product. Once Delivered, the wheel was sooo crammed with &amp;#34;rhinestones&amp;#34; that it was difficult to spin the  top part to the opening. There were several different styles and shapes of rhinestones as well. I did not count them, but there were a LOT of them! Immediately, I wanted to sit down to do my nails! Thank heavens, I decided to use them on myself before I used them on a client...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the smallest round circles, which were not all uniform in shapes and sizes. They were made out of plastic and poorly put together with excess plastic on the bottom of the stone. (Almost resembling a fried egg. The the &amp;#34;rhinestone&amp;#34; is the yolk and the excess plastic is the egg whites). Again, I know you get what you paid for, and I know that these aren&#x27;t Swarovski crystals but I was expecting some kind of &amp;#34;BLING&amp;#34;. There is none. There is no POP, Shimmer, or Bling. There is just a series of lumps on my nails, nothing catches the light; just opaque lumpy bumps on my nail...and this was BEFORE I put the top coat on my nails. I should have gone through my orders and ordered from the last seller that I purchased from. I guess this will teach me to stop being so lazy!!! lol. Good Luck with your &amp;#34;Rhinestones&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> gems are thick so you catch or bump them vs. flat nailpolish. variety is very good.</li>
    <li> FUN.The shapes show up on nail well.You wont find this in America.</li>
    <li> These are so much fun</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re just what i expected! Happy customer!</li>
    <li> These are way too small and you really have to be a nail professional type of person to use them!</li>
    <li> so completely adorable! i used these for my 4 year old daughter and she love love loved them. made her feel like a princess she said! I believe I will use them on my manicure too!!!</li>
    <li> Just received rhinestone pack. Very exited can&#x27;t wait to use them. It didn&#x27;t take as long to arrive, that was a plus.</li>
    <li> hearts, stars, butterfies, different size crystals make your pedi look unique and feminine and fun. Uber small, though. You need a steady hand and proper tools to apply!</li>
    <li> Bigger stones than I thought, very nice!</li>
    <li> Cheap, but good quality set of pieces in it. Look good</li>
    <li> These are cute and nice, they serve their purpose and are really pretty. They are just so small and hard to manage and apply to nails, but I recommend tweezers.</li>
    <li> Super adorable! They don&#x27;t need  to much glue to hold down since they are small and light weight. I love them and recommend them to nail  artist  everywhere!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re ok...mediocre at best! You get what you pay for! Not 1200 pieces either! !!</li>
    <li> This nail art is supper cute! I would buy more</li>
    <li> Great product! Loved them all!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Lots of teeny crystals in various shapes. Lots of fun for nail art or even scrapbooking... Yay!</li>
    <li> It have this stars, flowers, and diferents shape so cute, it give this amazing eleagance to the designs! ! ,</li>
    <li> It was small, it looked much bigger when i got it, i was not happy. but it worked for what i need it</li>
    <li> I was going to say it is expensive ($4.34) compared with \\&quot;SODIAL(TM) 3000 Nail Art Gems Mixed Colours Shapes in Case\\&quot;($1.5 w/free shipping) at first, but since the seller realized itself is a somewhat \\&quot;sharp profiteer\\&quot; and changed the price from $4.34 to $0.08, I will let it go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the product itself, this is DEFINITELY not large as what it is look like in the picture. It is a small tiny case like one quarter and half.  And since it just has one singular color, the different shapes actually look like the same from others&#x27; view, unless someone pick up one of your finger, compare and check with another finger. |0|&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, it can work as a decorator when you want have some nail art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I recommend to try this before it: [[ASIN:B008U1Q4DI B008U1Q4DI]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you still want to open a nail art salon, I would say please go with this.</li>
    <li> Nail Art MoYou Silver Moon Rhinestone Pack of 1200 Crystal Premium Quality...&lt;br /&gt;good quality, nice, easy to use, bought from</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used on the nail yet.  Were not as sparkly as I thought they would be.  I think I will still use them though.</li>
    <li> These stones are the tiniest things ever. They are practically impossible to use. And they get all mixed up. I guess they are okay. I expected them to be bigger, all the same and have different sizes. You get a lot of different little shapes. Which I guess that&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM! you will never get it!&lt;br /&gt;i purchased this SEPTEMBER 2013, and it is now in the middle of JANUARY 2014!&lt;br /&gt;its not the fact its so cheap, but that they rip people off and are making a profit from it!</li>
    <li> They came in the mail yesterday, they are really small but they work for me. You can fix more than one on each nail.</li>
    <li> There are all kinds of shapes in this little box.  The variety is awesome.  It is not really a rhinestone, more like shapes cut out of alluminum.</li>
    <li> like the different shapes in the wheel, easy to pick up and they stay very good on the nail with just a top coat!</li>
    <li> These rhinestones are great, with a number of different styles and looks.  The stones vary in styles from stars to flowers and everything in between.  Great for creating a fun, flirty look or a more classic look for a more formal occasion</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, plentiful, fast shipping....for my various projects (nails, costume, makeup, props, art, decorations).  Easy transaction, glitters are bright without looking cheesy.</li>
    <li> These are NOT very clear or shiny at all. they are pretty dull and not even molded well as they are mis shapen and pretty crappy. THe shapes aren&#x27;t even made well as there is acrylic spill over and they look to be all &amp;#34;rejects&amp;#34; DO NOT BUY! Save ur $ and get some higher quality ones for your nails!!</li>
    <li> The product I received had different shapes but not round. I couldnt make a lot of designs because it was missing the round crystals.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty &amp;#34;cost efficient&amp;#34; (cheap) when it comes to buying things I&#x27;ve never bought before and since I recently decided to try doing Nail Art, I shopped around online for a while until I settled on buying these. It was a great choice! They are pretty tiny, but with any set of tweezers, they are fairly easy to pick up and maneuver. Plus, they are really shiny and they&#x27;re pretty durable as long as you glue them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Do not cover in clear coat because it removes all traces of the facets.</li>
    <li> Loved the price as well as the amount of items.  Have used several of these stones already.  Easy to use, esp. w/tweezers.  Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I love these rhinestones! They&#x27;re nice to make a simple mani nice! Just paint a color of your choice and add them on! My rhinestones have been on for over a week now and they&#x27;re on my nail pretty tight. I was afraid they&#x27;d fall off before my nail even chips but they&#x27;re really sturdy!</li>
    <li> you can make so much designs with it that its unbelieveable. i just cant stop creating designs., totally love it</li>
    <li> This would cost probably $5-$10 at a store. Nice variety of different shapes &amp; all my pockets has a generous amount of gems. Would deffinatly recommend for every nail guru !</li>
    <li> I sill havent got it I will not buy a nothing from you</li>
    <li> Super Excited my rhinestones came in. They are super gorgeous and I love all of the different designs. They are super amazing!</li>
    <li> The actual container these come in is NOT very friendly, I would recommend having something else to put these in as they get mixed up with each turn.  But the actual stones are so cute, and many.  Thank you, but consider a different container?</li>
    <li> Sparkles all over for new nail designs I will enjoy love it thank you</li>
    <li> Ordered: 02/27/2014&lt;br /&gt;Received: 03/12/2014&lt;br /&gt;Seller: Cube Protection&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was very swift for an overseas order.  It came packaged in a small yellow envelope and the wheel was then sealed in a plastic bag.  The stones obviously shifted around during shipping, but this did not matter because I did not receive any varied rhinestones.  All of the stones were round.  I was not too surprised based on previous reviews.  I was however disappointed in the shine of them.  They are not very faceted so tend to look more like dots on your nails.  Although I did not carefully count them, I feel that 1200 is a good guess for the amount I received.  These will be fun to play with but I will not be using them as often as I hoped.</li>
    <li> Pretty cheaply made but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> i was really shocked on how many was in the wheel. and how nice they all love. i love them. they look amazing on my nails. a great buy</li>
    <li> I love the way the gems glisten and even with gel over top they still glistened they are small and not big thank you</li>
    <li> Good starter set! They aren&#x27;t exactly high end, but there&#x27;s a lot of it, so that makes up for the quality.</li>
    <li> It might not be 1200 pieces, but there&#x27;s more in here than I could ask for, especially for the price! The sorting and the packaging is wonderful, and these look great on. I would recommend a pair of nail art tweezers so you can be more precise in placement of these tiny rhinestones.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and value for the price. The quality is unbelievable for such a low cost.  I have shared this along with other products to my local nail salon to save them a lot of money!</li>
    <li> I have now used roughly 1/3 of these, after many months of being used at least once a week by several people.  I especially like that they contain 3 different sizes of round stones.  The shine is slightly duller than you would find on rhinestones at a beauty supply--in the packs of 60 for $10 that is.  For the price, they are WONDERFUL and plentiful, and I will definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> I love this. Well worth the wait when you calculate how much it costs to add these types of things to your nails at the salon.</li>
    <li> Casing is inadequate. Does not keep stones separate and when it arrover everything was all mixed up.</li>
    <li> Arrived  early was exactly as described. They look beautiful they are a stocking stuffer for my daughter  for Christmas.</li>
    <li> The count is way off, otherwise, the rhinestones are as expected. For the price, it&#x27;s not terrible, but would appreciate them being honest!</li>
    <li> Super cute and very worth the price! :-)</li>
    <li> Meh...Not a fan of this set.  Weird looking rhinestones and (although I did not count them), not close to 1200...</li>
    <li> Different shapes, no rounds.</li>
    <li> Omg it&#x27;s great I love all the shapes, very easy to put on and they stay on very well. Great buy.</li>
    <li> The items keep falling off when I apply and most importantly they get snagged in any fabric.  This may just be a personal preference.</li>
    <li> All the different shapes definitely get the creative mind going.  For the 4th of July, I used the stars for my flag nails and the end result was very impressive.  Even after sealing the design with clear polish, they lost none of their dimension.  Great!!</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price! If you are looking for rhinestones this is a great place to start! The only thing I would reccomend is that you make sure to use a rhinestone polish. I didnt loose a single one.</li>
    <li> Very cute and they did not cost much, only a few cents totally worth it too. I will be getting more.</li>
    <li> It is very small and the lid just turns, it dosnt actually come off, so they are very hard to work with.</li>
    <li> The gem wheel is a great product, and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong, easy to select shape and long lasting when on your nail.</li>
    <li> This came faster then expected. Love it!</li>
    <li> The wheel is tiny. A lot smaller than I expected and doesn&#x27;t look like there are 1200 crystals. But, they are so cute and I will definitely get a lot of use out of them!</li>
    <li> While the title of the product claims that these are crystal \\&quot;premium quality\\&quot; gemstones, that simply is not the case. Nonetheless, for 2$ and free shipping they are still a worthwhile buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the item arrived, it was clear that the round case contains silver looking gems in a wide variety of designs.&lt;br /&gt;The package contained a mix that included 3 different sizes of round gemstones, curved gemstones, hearts, flowers, teardrops, ovals, triangles, rectangles, squares, and stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gems are easy to apply and stay in place well using either a small amount of topcoat or nail glue. They are great for adding a bit of pizzazz to an otherwise basic manicure!</li>
    <li> Awesome price and nice product.  I have not used it yet, but there is a nice selection of tiny clear rhinestones.</li>
    <li> Smaller than what the website said, I am disappointed</li>
    <li> Good product but too smaa</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Very nice rhinestone set. Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and set in polish. good variety, perfect size pieces. use tweezers.</li>
    <li> The stones are not as pretty as I thought they would be. I&#x27;ve seen better. The problem is with some of the shapes.</li>
    <li> These come in lots of shapes and sizes, so you can use them to make different designs. Recommend using tweezers.</li>
    <li> Very cute! It didn&#x27;t take that long to arrive as expected</li>
    <li> For what you pay there really shouldn&#x27;t be complaints.  They are not OMG amazing, but they are great for certain things.  If you need swarovski quality, I&#x27;d suggest looking elsewhere but for projects and a bit of fun these are perfect.</li>
    <li> I enjoy having my nails done, these will be very fun to use &amp; add a little bling to my nails.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected! Don&#x27;t like it. Worth its price I guess?? I can design something I suppose.</li>
    <li> I like it item as described I&#x27;m just adding more to get the word requirement. Happy with my purchase thanks again</li>
    <li> it has lots of fun shapes and designs. Shipping was a bit of a wait but it was well worth it.</li>
    <li> A great deal for the price. I used them to fix some costume jewelry.They can also be glued to toe/finger nails.</li>
    <li> Not near as many as quoted and it was a mess when I received it, but an assortment of shapes and great sizes. Great buy and fun for my daughter and myself!</li>
    <li> Great price. Small enough for accent nails and possibly craft projects as well. If you require small accent pieces I would definitely order these.</li>
    <li> These are tiny and pretty and I do believe I got 1200 of them. I use them with duo eyelash adhesive to high light make up. They are perfect.</li>
    <li> I was expecting to get different shaped rhinestones but I only got the circular shaped ones. Their is a lot of them in the container but still pretty disappointed. I was looking forward to all the different shapes it said it came with.</li>
    <li> Delivery timing was good and the actual product itself wasn&#x27;t bad but it didn&#x27;t come with moon shaped rhinestones and that was the reason I had purchased it in the first place! :(</li>
    <li> These are great - Can do many designs. There are quite a few shapes, and I&#x27;m looking forward to using them all - can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> I like that the crystals are in different shapes,but some shapes are soo small that its hard to make out for example, the crescent moons are too tiny.</li>
    <li> loved the product only thing is I wish that they were a little more shinier otherwise everything is good no complaints</li>
    <li> Cheap, tacky, and not at all what I thought they were going to be. I wanted to use them to gem one nail fully but there are just larger sizes and they look cheap!</li>
    <li> Great price, look just as expected. There are a bunch of designs and so far I&#x27;ve only used the round and flower ones and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll use the others, but I couldn&#x27;t find a better price and the spinny wheel stays closed so I don&#x27;t lose any all over the place.</li>
    <li> these are cute, but are a christmas gift for a friend. i&#x27;m sure she will love them and like using them</li>
    <li> I placed a order with this seller on December 3rd and this product came in the mail 11 days later. I must say I was very disappointed cause some of the rhinestone was missing out of the manicure wheel. I didn&#x27;t get 12000 crystal premium quality rhinestones. But I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Received 21 days after purchased. It came in a small yellow envelope from Asia. No complaints. Lots of pieces. I don&#x27;t know if I will be able to finish them all.... hehe. I didn&#x27;t like Some shapes but is ok. For the price. Less than 2 dollars, is ok :) I recommend this product. I can&#x27;t wait to start doing my nails.... ;) I live in Georgia USA. Ohh, I was forgetting.... it looks kind of cheap but I guess it will look cute in a well painted nails.</li>
    <li> The come in various shapes and are very useful. i get my nails done alot and id rather pay for these here than pay the ridiculous amount at the nail place for these. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Lots of choices for your nails and still a good deal, I&#x27;m fairly sure there is not 1200 in the pack but I like them.</li>
    <li> They seem to be about 2mm or more in the picture but are actually only 1mm, which is about the size of a large glitter particle. I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use them for my nails but will probably use them as glitter for decorating cards or small knickknacks.</li>
    <li> I gave this a 5 rating because the price is excellent and in my opinion, it&#x27;s the same quality stones most nail salons use. I use this on myself and 6 year old when we want to add sass to our toenail art!! I purchased the colored rhinestones also. Cheapest price I&#x27;ve found ANYWHERE..</li>
    <li> The stones in this set are VERY cute but as stated above, there&#x27;s less than half of the 1200. The round wheel is itself way too small to hold 1200 stones and I counted one compartment and there were about 20 stones in it (which makes the count around 240).  And static electricity is so bad, that I lost an entire section of rhinestones just from opening the wheel (they stick to the top of the cover and fall out.  This isn&#x27;t the fault of the seller).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lot&#x27;s of questions about what&#x27;s in the package, so here&#x27;s what I got. 12 different kinds of &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; sized, silver backed, clear, rhinestones. As a reference point, the 1200pcs New Nail Art Rhinestones Glitters Acrylic Tips Decoration Manicure Wheel (the long case) stones are smaller than these and the MASH Rhinestones 2400 Piece 12 Color Nail Art Nailart Manicure Wheels (the round case) stones are larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shapes are;  small circles (compartment I lost), flowers, hearts, half an oval on one side - point on other side (name of shape?), triangles, stars, rectangles, small teardrops, squares, medium circles, crescent moons, and ovals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the set was still worth the money even if it&#x27;s less than 1200 stones.</li>
    <li> Poor quality!  They are not too sparkly either. I was not impressed by this product.  Luckily, I only paid about a dollar and some change.</li>
    <li> I really like what i got but the rhinestones were all mixed together and there is no glue to apply. Otherwise the produce is good and I like all of them</li>
    <li> They arrived on time but when I use them and put the top coat on the top coat dolls the shine on them</li>
    <li> My only complain was that the hearts don&#x27;t really look like hearts. The rest of the shapes were pretty good</li>
    <li> I love them. They are just what the picture shows. They look so cute on the nail. And boy they shine. They were package nice and fast shipping. And shipping was free. I can&#x27;t wait to order from your company again. I want to Thank you for a great job nicely done. I will spread the word about ordering from you. Thank you again. Happy, Happy, costumers I have.</li>
    <li> Loved the variety great for nails!! Ran into sum problems with the delivery the first time but they were very helpful and resend them right away and got them on a timely manner.</li>
    <li> The rhinestone are not shiny enough.  They are ok for one time use only.  For the price they are ok.</li>
    <li> Lots of varieties in this little wheel. Its perfect for nail art! I use them all the time, its perfect</li>
    <li> I ordered these, and read the reviews. I thought I would get several shapes...I only got the circular rhinestones.. That&#x27;s not what I thought I bought. I am way disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love all the charms! Great price for what you get!</li>
    <li> so much fun adding these to my nail  routine! they were shipped quickly too! they&#x27;re easy to use, and such a variety to chose from</li>
    <li> yeah, it took a while to get here, but i didn&#x27;t mind since i knew it was coming from international.&lt;br /&gt;but when i got them, i used them that night, i was so scared it would not actually stay on, but so far its nice, and its saying on very well. since i just got them, i dont know how long it&#x27;ll be on.&lt;br /&gt;but for this price, it is soooo worth it. ITS TOO CUTE&amp;#60;3. (: 5/5 &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I love it! Came on time and got precisely what it said I would get.</li>
    <li> They are silver like shapes that are cute in design, but not crystal gemstones or rhinestones.  Otherwise I can still create with these some beautiful designs</li>
    <li> How can I sum this up, very small container, however, was very secured and shipped promptly.  Maybe not sure, but I do give second chances.  Thanks</li>
    <li> good assortment for the price, the pack is smaller than expected based on the picture and stones are tiny but would buy again.</li>
    <li> Very cute. As described! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Jewels are great and small.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice but the picture makes it look like more than there is in the package. Still pretty neat!</li>
    <li> I have these on even as we speak.  I&#x27;ve received several comments (people always look at my nails because I keep them neat, but not too long).</li>
    <li> cute, cheap, fast delivery, easy to remove in a pinch. The only complaints are the silver residue left after the gems have fallen off (which can be damaging without a base coat, and difficult to remove) and the fact that the flower gems are a pain to stick on and don&#x27;t really like to stay on long. I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s just the way I am using them.</li>
    <li> Good product. You need to use a good top coat and have a good bag to hold the product in because it does spill.</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for. I don&#x27;t think that they are 1200 stones but there are a lot of them. Unfortunately they&#x27;re pretty low quality, more like craft store rhinestones that are sort of rounded and not very sparkly. But again they were pretty inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I originally expected to have just circle rhinestones, however when it arrived there were all sorts of shapes like hearts, stars, triangles etc .which was definitely a plus. Haven&#x27;t used the stones yet but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll work out fine.</li>
    <li> The product is of a very cheap quality and quite a few of the shapes are mis-shaped. They adhere fine to nails, but turn dull when top coat is applied. The gems were really cheap...and I guess, well, you get what you pay for..:-(</li>
    <li> I love these little things. I share them with my granddaughter. She used them for her nail art and we both use them for scrapbooking and paper crafts.</li>
    <li> Perfect to use them with any color in my nails, easy to play with them and I bought the color one too...love it!!</li>
    <li> Gave this to my niece as she is into creating intricate designs on nails. She really likes it, I have not personally used them.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and I was shocked at how small the container was, but it can hold a ton of these tiny rhinestones. I love how small they are, perfect for nail art. Make sure you&#x27;re applying them correctly! Like any other rhinestones then they will just fall off if you don&#x27;t do it right</li>
    <li> This is simple to make your nails look sparkley.  Great compliment to the design of flowers I have put on my nails and toes.</li>
    <li> Smaller than you think haha</li>
    <li> pretty much exactly as advertised, although obviously the disk is not as full in real life as it is in the pictures.</li>
    <li> was nice, butvthere was only abt ten in each compartment, and many of them were misshapen.</li>
    <li> Used these to bling out a boring generic iPhone case. Now it&#x27;s super cute and shiny. I did save some for my nails. I&#x27;ll be ordering more to bling out more stuff.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute but I&#x27;m very disappointed that there wasn&#x27;t 1200 at all.</li>
    <li> This deffinetly not what it looks. like. These look like little diamond like things with different shapes. It actually looks like cheap junk, and nothing like fake diamond or rhinestone. And by the time I got them, they were all out of the container and all mixed up. I will not be using these, they will go straight into the garbage. Looks like something for a little girl. I will not every buy anything out of country, or from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Super price but too small for me to do what I wanted...</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift for my granddaughter- it came 2 weeks before expected and she was thrilled with it! Thanks for making me look good:)</li>
    <li> Came on time and was a great present. Just the size stated and it was a great gift. Premium quality is only for those who know how to use them.</li>
    <li> liked the product, I am being satisfied,liked the product, I am being satisfied, it was sent by me in a gift i hope so act set for the one to which a present was given as</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no way to use these Rhinestones there so small it&#x27;s like pouring salt you will have glitter all over everything !!</li>
    <li> These rhinestones arrived weeks sooner than promised:)&lt;br /&gt;However,  they are all the same shape (circle). There are different sizes, but mostly large &amp; mixed together.&lt;br /&gt;Why have different compartments if they&#x27;re just gonna mix them up? No big deal for me, but just FYI.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used them yet, but they look like any other bling on the market for nail art.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like acrylics and this last really long on my nails (just about a week) I go about my designs normally with polish and glitter an these bad boys. Its just so yummy to look at!</li>
    <li> Loved itttttttt,  little shine on your nails for that price? I rrecommend that a big time. All I need a little fantasy.</li>
    <li> As described, easy to use!</li>
    <li> I received my order very quickly.. was supposed to b here between April 22nd-may 4th. I ordered it March 24 and received it April 8th. It is smaller then I thought but I&#x27;m not complaining at all. The shapes are super cute and the perfect size for nail art..I can&#x27;t wait to use them. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Smaller than it&#x27;s supposed to be an no where near the amount of pieces it&#x27;s supposed to have</li>
    <li> Once you put them on a nail and you put a top coat over it, it makes the shininess dull, and it just makes it look tacky. But good for the price I guess.</li>
    <li> Great purchase.  It came from China, but still got here during the time frame they gave me at purchase. Good quality. No problems. Would buy again. Love the size!</li>
    <li> there are a lot of different shapes and these are all perfect size for the nail not to big and not to small</li>
    <li> I can put bling bling on my toes or my nails.  There are so many rhinestones and several different shapes, I will never have to order any ever again!</li>
    <li> It was very good to use and fun and easy for travel and olive it I&#x27;m going to get some more when I get the chance too and the price was totalally AWSOME :)</li>
    <li> These are small and cute. Shipping does take time though. It still arrived before the estimated date. The moons and star are small and great for nails. I love nail art and this was a great addition for my collection. Check out my nail art slideshow on YouTube&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;8mI6RWODtc0&amp;feature&#x3D;youtube_gdata_player</li>
    <li> Now I can do my own designs with these rhinestones. The price is right much lesser then the stores. It just tooka while for delivery.</li>
    <li> If I could give zero stars I would. First it takes forever to get my product then after I get it I open it up and ask of the rhinestones were all mixed up in the bag it came in, so I sorted them out myself</li>
    <li> I love this container, and it had great price for the product, I recommend for everyone and would definitely buy again if the price and quality stays the sames</li>
    <li> I really wanted these because I love silver gems and I like how they are all different sizes.  I ordered these and a set of multicolored gems but when they came in the mail I got 2 sets of the multicolored ones and NO silver set.  Really bummed.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted... :)</li>
    <li> I really like how easy it is to apply the rhinestones to your nails and just how pretty they are in the lights.</li>
    <li> It is low quality and a sad excuse for rhinestone crystal premium quality. That is exactly what it&#x27;s not. Not worth your money unless it isn&#x27;t to make your nails adorable. Cause they wont.</li>
    <li> nice crystals for nails</li>
    <li> Love decorating my nails! These are perfect!</li>
    <li> perfect!!! love this bling! and cheap too!</li>
    <li> Its cute and useful. I get many complements on my nails when i use these.</li>
    <li> I havnt used this item yet but I do have stones that I have used and they are like the icing on cake to finish off your art work. They add a little class to art work</li>
    <li> They looked great for a photo shoot I did makeup for they stayed on the face using eyelash glue came out superb.</li>
    <li> Great item, large variety of pieces inside, and the circular container is perfect for keeping everything safe from getting lost or all over the place!</li>
    <li> I would rate it higher since the price is amazing, but the quality really is not great at all. If you use a top coat over it, it gets very hazy and foggy looking. There are little burrs on some of the pieces. I would suggest spending $4 more for something better quality. I use these to practice on, and the container is useful - but I ended up throwing them away.</li>
    <li> these pictures make these products look so luscious and worth the price and every time I received something it&#x27;s like a mini dinky thing and I&#x27;m mad at myself every time</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t really rhinestones.  They&#x27;re more like silver foil cutouts.  Not at all what I expected or what was described.  Additionally, the shapes aren&#x27;t even clear.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. They came all mixed up and there were only like 3 shapes.</li>
    <li> Very nice product. I used them for my nails a few weeks ago. The gems came off after a few days, but that is to be expected.</li>
    <li> well I love this item I will be enjoying my bling out toes in the summertime thanks a lot this is a good buy for anyone who like Glitter&#x27;s are jewels on their toes or fingers you love it very reasonable just with they had some in colors</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re a little bigger than I expected but they&#x27;re still pretty.  Wheel is easy to turn and get the shape you want.</li>
    <li> I just received mine&#x27;s today &amp; they really came early ...... the container is sooo full, thank u so much i&#x27;ll be ordering again.</li>
    <li> i bought for nail easy to use nice price use with a clear coat  look good on nail easy to use for price buy it</li>
    <li> I would definitely order this product again.  There is so many shapes included in the package,  I have tons of fun experimenting with them all.</li>
    <li> *my first review was cut off LOL* I didn&#x27;t really like these. The fab brush was great but the heads on the rest of the brushes keep falling off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fine with then just that the bows are extremely small and the wheel isn&#x27;t really full but I&#x27;m fine with that due to the fact that the wheel is big</li>
    <li> I though I was getting different size circle rhinestones, instead they were stars, rectangles,stars and hearts to name a few, yes there was a set of circles as well but I would have preferred all circles.</li>
    <li> All the pieces were scattered. And not organized. Took a long time to come.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and looks beautiful on your nail.  My daughter used to make starry night nails for New Years</li>
    <li> love them!! Too cute :)</li>
    <li> Love these, wish they were a little bigger and if they kept their shine when you put a top coat on it. For the price, it is fabulous. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I love them. Took forever to get to me though</li>
    <li> I was super impressed with shipping! It came a week early than the expected delivery date range! I did expect a bigger wheel considering how many rhinestones the description claims this includes. It&#x27;s a very small wheel with 12 compartments. That means I should have 100 pieces per compartment to equal 1200 rhinestones. That is definitely not the case. It was very inexpensive so I&#x27;m not gonna waste time requesting a refund. I don&#x27;t think it should be advertised with misleading information, though.</li>
    <li> Totally Satisfied!! Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> Great price and love the various sizes.</li>
    <li> Purchased these a while ago, they took months to come in, once I received them they were not as described in the pictures. I only got round jewels and they were microscopic, you had to wet the end of a needle or toothpick to pick one up. Terrible purchase but you get what you pay for. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Cheap quality does not match pic didn&#x27;t get full order after waiting 4+weeks.</li>
    <li> Really nice for the price.</li>
    <li> On time and really pretty and variety really like them</li>
    <li> came partially empty and open all over the place</li>
    <li> Awesome stones for my nail art designs. Love all the different shapes.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for a wedding bachelorette party loved it so much had to buy each girl one for future personal use</li>
    <li> Very GOOD as promised</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected but otherwise it works well and ain&#x27;t no \\&quot;premium crystal\\&quot; just plain plastic. They stayed on my nail longer than I would expect but that depends on the glue.</li>
    <li> Not only do I use these on my nails, They are great for arts and crafts too.</li>
    <li> I love my diamonds so cute!</li>
    <li> No problems.  Like these.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price and fast shipping!!!!</li>
    <li> Really tiny not what I expected not happy at all and it took forever to get delivered</li>
    <li> just as it said it would be, safely packed tyvm</li>
    <li> These rimstones are beautiful! Thank you and delivery came a few days earlier! I love amazon!</li>
    <li> I love the product. Its exactly as described. I would recommend. It took 6 days to arrive but I got it and love it.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:efae87a3a447384f9bd35f1a542c8abc]]I like these gems..they are small and I can create unique patterns with them. I purchased them to get more creative in my nail designs, however I am unhappy that the description lies about how many come in a package. I counted..yes...every..last..one of them! NO WHERE CLOSE to 1200! Also not 12 different shapes either, unless they are talking about all the half stars or mis-shaped gems..In total I had only 265 silver gems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not even complain if the amount was the same as stated in the description. For the price paid it is still an okay deal..I guess. Upsetting however but I&#x27;ll live..Like everyone else probably thinks after purchasing..\\&quot;it was cheap\\&quot; and goes about their day..still a lie. Tsk - tsk! I hope the company starts packaging more gems in the crappy containers that the gems stick to or changes that 1200 down to a more realistic number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like using these, and will eventually bite the bullet and buy a pricier pack of gems that actually comes with the right amount instead of wasting money over and over on these small packages. I am pleading with you, please work out these issues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and these are super easy to apply..&lt;br /&gt;Paint nails, allow them to get tacky..and start placing gems in a design, pattern or just randomly..&lt;br /&gt;the tacky nail polish should hold the gems in place nicely while you paint a clear coat of polish over the top of them..&lt;br /&gt;allow to dry..!!</li>
    <li> My daughter loved the crystals for decorating a person&#x27;s nails after a manicure. I would order this item again.</li>
    <li> very small  but to glue unto flowers to give them a sparkle is another tip for what these can be used for.  container is easy to use and keeps them in plae until you use the.</li>
    <li> These are a cute item for girls who love to do their nails as I do. They are very tiny so make sure you have some tweezers or a pencil to pick them up. I know a lot of people like bigger sizes but I like that they are really tiny they will definitely look cute on toenails. Shipping does take a while if you do free shipping but its fun waiting for your stuff to come and for the price I don&#x27;t mind waiting a couple weeks for stuff for a $100 I got so much nail stuff from amazon that would probably cost over $500 in retail stores so the wait is worth it to me it will probably last the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> These work amazingly for my projects. Item arrived as described and is just like the info states and is pictured</li>
    <li> These came very fast and are a fun way to ad bling to a manicure or pedicure. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I expected to get the silver one from the pictures. Received colorful ugly ones instead.</li>
    <li> I bought these when they were just $0.36 and the shipping was over a $1 so I really got a good deal. They are very pretty and sparkly, when I took a couple out to look at them in my hand. Now I wouldn&#x27;t swear that the amount of crystals is 1200; because it&#x27;s not as if I&#x27;m really going to count them. Mine came all neat and tidy, none misplaced or messy; and the wheel isn&#x27;t loose like some other reviews I&#x27;ve read. I would repurchase when I need more.</li>
    <li> When you put clear polish over these fake plastic stones, they turn really cloudy and look very dull.....save your money and invest in the glass stones.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the amount of stones. My clients love them, I use them all the time. I will order more in the future</li>
    <li> These rhinestones are super awesome and so easy to use, i love them and would recommend anyone to get them</li>
    <li> These stones are so pretty!  They are an awesome addition to my nail art designs, and the wheel case they come in save my clumsy BLEEP from making a mess!  I highly recommend these if you do any kind of nail art or crafting.  Fantastic deal and worth every penny and more.  :)  HAVE FUN!</li>
    <li> The shipping was faster than the shipping expected date, mine came about 2 weeks after ordering!  The container was smaller than I expected it is about 3  inches diameter.  The way I use these is first I pick out which stones I want with tweezers and then carefully close the container.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the container is difficult to use, but if I do it carefully its not really a big deal to me.  Next I put on my color nail polish and allow it to dry.  After it is dry, I put a drop of nail glue where I want to put the stone.  One at a time I place the stones on the glue drops WITH TWEEZERS.  To finish, I apply a top coat.  These are perfect for my needs I love them and good value too only about 1 dollar!</li>
    <li> Lots of beautiful little accents for my nails. I love giving myself pedicures during the summer months and these give it just that extra little sparkle. Very easy to use. I use tweezers.</li>
    <li> Just learning nail art. This has so many adorable shapes. Love it.</li>
    <li> Really nice and cool product! Several sizes and like 10 different shapes! You dont need to buy glue for them. A little bit of transparent nail polish underneath, and a coat on top of it and the nail and you ll be done! They last forever!! Super shiny!</li>
    <li> These little rhinestone studs are awesome. There are many different shapes and they are the perfect size for nailart. The only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; I would have is that the wheel top doesn&#x27;t come off which can be a little frustrating to get the stones out. Other than that, I would definitely buy another.</li>
    <li> I guess for the price I paid it was completely what I paid for.  They are not very shiny though.  Even with my amazingly brilliant top coat they still do not shine...  But like I said, these are completely adequate for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my nails. I would recommend these if you like to work on your nails. They look great!</li>
    <li> the sizes and variety of shapes are exactly What i expected. I will order this item again very very soon</li>
    <li> Some of our friends and families members enjoy decorating their own nails with all kinds of artsy items like these and varied colors and the like, so we purchased these sets for these people, and as far as we know, they are pleased with them, and enjoying them. The little pieces are tiny, but, after all, one&#x27;s nails are relatively tiny, so for that reasoning, these art pieces need to be petite, and they are petite, but bright, and shiny and seem to be well-liked. Blessings.</li>
    <li> The package was compact. Affordable price. Item arrived within arrival date. Items are as described on the site. The rhinestones are small and just right for my small nails.</li>
    <li> This product arrived ahead of schedule as was as described.  The only reason that I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the fact that many of the rhinestone shapes are mixed together and I have a difficult time trying to sort them out when I am working on my nails.</li>
    <li> Received the product and the lid was busted. So they were all over the place in the container. Made it very difficult  to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so small not good quality they are all different sizes mixed I haven&#x27;t used them cause they are horrible</li>
    <li> The quality is great!! i have bought this sort of thing for almost $10 in a shop before, got it home and the entire thing has fallen apart. THIS product has been fantastic. I was only slightly disappointed to learn its actually only 6 different shapes, not 12, however it means you get more of that one stone instead of running out quickly and buying a new one for that one stone. HIGHLY recommend buying it!!!</li>
    <li> I took a double look when I got them.  In the picture you really can not appreciate the details but trust me that you will not be disappointed and if you use  rhinestones a lot you will want to buy more than one.</li>
    <li> Im able to decorate little nik nats around the house. I didnt realize that it ca,me with so many different shapes! I love it!</li>
    <li> this product was ok just not enough stones</li>
    <li> I bought it for myself hoping I could do something a little different to my nails. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that the turn dial thing is hard for me to turn but other than that awesome buy.</li>
    <li> Loads of crystals to play with :) I like a lot! :)</li>
    <li> I choose this rating for the simple that I order something and they send something different , it said Pack of 1200 Crystal Premium Quality Gemstones in 12 different shapes and sizes; It was the 1200 in different sizes, but not shapes, so i was a little disappointed, I need them really bad so I didn&#x27;t have a choice so I used them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karla Buckner</li>
    <li> I like the variety offered in this pack. I wish there was more of the plain round stones instead of rectangle but still good for the price.</li>
    <li> I am very dissapointed with this product it said 1200 crystals there is so little that it impposiblie to bu 1200. I will never buy from here agian not worth my money to buy it at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite small, but there is a lot of variety in the different Rhinestones. The only annonying thing was when I got them I had to reorganize them because it was such a mess. Overall qreat product and even came early. :)</li>
    <li> These are NOT Rhinestones, they are metal slivers in the various shapes. They are not flat either, they are flat on one side and the other side is bent up metal giving the illusion of rhiestones but not very good for wearing as they would catch on everything so you have to flatten them out anyway.</li>
    <li> these are Shiny but also tiny, tiny, tiny, but once i put them on my nails i think they will look nice.</li>
    <li> Its okay the Rhinestones were smaller than I expected but the selling price was fair so I really no complaint. I still used the product and enjoyed them</li>
    <li> My daughter and I do our nails together often. The stones/stickers/stamping/glitter/ and so on is always a must...This can get pricey, so I love this little wheel of options, and she knows she can use as many as she would like.</li>
    <li> The rhinestones came in a nice neat pack, nothing misplaced or spilled. The rhinestones are okay, a little on the small side and a bit dull, but a little top coat can make them shine. My order actually shipped 2 weeks early than expected, so a really nice product overall! Will be ordering this again soon!</li>
    <li> They were really cute, but a lot smaller than I expected but I still love them, if only it came with more :(</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and came faster than expected! Thanks!</li>
    <li> They were not what I thought. they are plastic, not stones. I guess i didn&#x27;t read it right. I didn&#x27;t like them. I bought these and the different color ones.</li>
    <li> Beautiful for nail art :)</li>
    <li> like these nail art item for the price</li>
    <li> These rhinestones are super cute and really small so they do not look tacky.  It came a lot earlier than expected too.  I really love doing my nails so these are perfect.  I am going to get more of these rhinestone wheels in the future.</li>
    <li> Item as described and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> plenty to choice from</li>
    <li> Wasnt what I was expecting. I ordered the moon shapes and got random shapes.  But came eariler then expected. And the wheel wasnt even close to half full.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I hate them, but I&#x27;m definitely displeased by the false advertisement. It says that the rhinestones come in a pack of 1200, when I barely received 200. This is not what I was looking for, and it does not deserve the decent rating. I received two slots with the same oval shaped gem, and although it is cute, I feel that this has cheated me out of the product that I believed I had purchased.</li>
    <li> plenty of sparkling crystal nail art for me to have fun! Love it!</li>
    <li> I like the nail rhinestones</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s different than the one in the picture, it is really tiny. but, i cant complain, it is what i wanted and for a great price.</li>
    <li> I like this mini rhinestone wheel. Its comes in silver clear and is many different shapes. I didn&#x27;t not count them but there seemed to be between 10-15 in each. I wish it came with more plain circle rhinestones. It did arrive before its delivery date.</li>
    <li> Beautiful nail art add ons!</li>
    <li> I love these! They are adorable and there are plenty of each to do the same design on each nail</li>
    <li> Easy to use, tons of pieces it was very full!  Great price and look great!</li>
    <li> Item as described, very happy. Great seller</li>
    <li> The package came weeks before the expected delivery date. I am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Came just as expected.</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s excellent. Very pleased!!!!!</li>
    <li> My order arrived  on time and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed with the product. The pack came in different shapes and the shapes are wonderful. I love it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these little gems! I need to get more!</li>
    <li> Charms fall off in a couple days even with heavy sealant top coat</li>
    <li> Delivery time was less than estimated but not really what I&#x27;d call &amp;#34;fast&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this is exactly what I wanted, what was advertised. They&#x27;re very pretty and perform just as you&#x27;d expect.</li>
    <li> Not even close to what was promised. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> very beautiful but not as much as in the picture.....  great quality though</li>
    <li> So many different nail art to choose from and it comes with extras, came earlier than expected. LOVED IT!</li>
    <li> Very happy with product</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and just as described. Spinning &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; slot lets you access jewels without fear of losing them due to other container types.</li>
    <li> Love these little studs, so cute!</li>
    <li> I love these. Not only do I use them on my nails bit I use them in art and scrapbooks</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this purchase! I bought what is advertised as &amp;#34;Moyou&amp;#34; brand rhinestones, and the photos even show the Moyou artwork and the signature sparkle of Moyou stones...however, the wheel I recieved has no brand name and no Moyou graphics. Not to mention that they were spilled in the package and tiny &amp;#34;stones&amp;#34; were everywhere! Had to sort the whole wheel.Would not have bought a knock-off if the info abt this product was truthful and accurate. Almost no sparkle on these plastic stones with a thick backing which sits very high on the nail making them uncomfortable to wear and easy to dislodge from the surface with normal wear. Buyer beware and buy authentic if you can!</li>
    <li> i saw these at sallys and they had about 50 for 4.00 dollars.  not cool dude.  i like the different shapes and sizes for a really great price and it arrived very quickly too</li>
    <li> Stones very small. Picture deceiving</li>
    <li> Great product will buy again beautiful love the silver moon rhinestone  just what I thought it will be can&#x27;t wait to try</li>
    <li> good quality.  good choices to choose from on sizes.  easy to use.  came in in record time.  will buy again</li>
    <li> The delivery for the rhinestones actually came a few days earlier than expected. LOVE the rhinestones!! Exactly what I wanted, I am so excited to try them and have some fun putting designs on my nails!!</li>
    <li> The selection is nice but the size of the pack is small and looks like way less rinestones.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item on the 25th of May and received it on the 1st of June and DELIVERY ESTIMATE: Thursday June 20, 2013 - Tuesday July 9, 2013 by 8:00pm.&lt;br /&gt; I was happy with the prompt delivery way ahead of scheduled time. I received a wheel with 12 compartments of various shapes. The breakdown as follows&lt;br /&gt;3.circle shapes (diff sizes) 1.heart 1.square 1.rectangle 1.flower 1.teardrop 1.star 1.triangle 1.oval 1.paisley like shape&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t ask me how many came in the wheel because i don&#x27;t have the time to count something so small but, it does look like the full amount.&lt;br /&gt;As far as quality goes its says, rhinestones crystal premium quality and that is NOT what it is. These are i guess plastic type material but glass/rhinestone&lt;br /&gt;they definitely ARE NOT. They become kinda dull looking after you apply glue to make them stay on the nail but if you use top coat for application its not as bad.I was going to use these for clients nails but because of the dulling i wont, I just use them for my pretty toenails :) Overall its worth the price. I mean come on what do you expect for less than 2 dollars and that&#x27;s shipping included. I just don&#x27;t like them advertising them as something they really are not. I hope this review helps someone  :)</li>
    <li> This is an a amazing product I love it so much It came way before it said it would. It adds some bling to my nails and works great they are shiny and stay on great there are many different shapes and sizes For the price they are it is totally worth it I definatley recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> I like to do my own nails, so this is perfect for me! I love the assortment of the different shapes!</li>
    <li> This was a really good buy, the price and quality are worth it. They are easy to use and very cute for all nail designs or whatever u want to put them on. Also my shipment arrived very fast. I will order these again.</li>
    <li> They are really small</li>
