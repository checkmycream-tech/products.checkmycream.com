      <li>i first tried in the morning, but noticed that my face was a bit oily after a few hours, but then again i live in tropic country and also tried a new brand of moisturizer and sunblock (olay regenerist and avene sunblock), but after i blotted, my face looks fresh again.</li>
      <li>It was runny and did not do much for me unless I used half the bottle.</li>

    <li> A gift for some Chinese friends. Estee Lauder is the Gold Standard for cosmetics in China, and my friends are so beautiful, it must be working!</li>
    <li> with just one application, u can see and feel the difference. your skin looks hydrated. i first tried in the morning, but noticed that my face was a bit oily after a few hours, but then again i live in tropic country and also tried a new brand of moisturizer and sunblock (olay regenerist and avene sunblock), but after i blotted, my face looks fresh again.
