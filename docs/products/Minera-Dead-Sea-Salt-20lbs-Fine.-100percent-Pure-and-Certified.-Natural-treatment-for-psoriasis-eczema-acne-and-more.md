      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d order this product again ;-)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;re looking for if you&#x27;re interested in a salt bath soak.  </li>
      <li>One or two pounds of it in a hot bath</li>
      <li>I think anyway ;)</li>
      <li>I used this in conjunction with a salt system for my hot tub (TechniChlor 110 Hot Tub and Spa Saltwater System Chorine Generator).</li>
      <li>So, I remembered hearing that dead sea salt was good for psoriasis and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
      <li>Very clean salt and comes in a solid resealable bag.</li>
      <li>I really like the fine texture -- it mixes well with essential oils and dissolves right away in water.</li>
      <li>I cannot tolerate many scents, essential oils, and the like on my skin, I am highly allergic.  </li>
      <li>quick web search pulled up  many benefits of using Dead Sea Salt as a therapy soak.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This salt is the real deal.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin much happier.</li>
      <li>Its much gentler than Epsom salts.  </li>
      <li>so she could really get the benefits all over her skin.  </li>
      <li>Salt baths really help my daughter&#x27;s eczema.</li>
      <li>I go through so much of this stuff.</li>
      <li>so much so that I gave up the creams and lotions - along with the ineffective and overpriced doctors as well....</li>
      <li>Within 3 days his whole body exploded in eczema.</li>
      <li>Most are marked as &amp;#34;closed&amp;#34; which means private from your friends and newsfeed.</li>
      <li>After just 2 uses my skin has never been this soft!!!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this stuff and have recommended this to others on other websites</li>
      <li>I have purchased magnesium chloride flakes from other companies but this one is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Has helped my eczema more than any other treatment including prescriptions!</li>
      <li>The eczema is still there, but it seems to bother her less as long as I stay on top of the baths (nice long 30 minute soak) and the moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>This was my second order and plan to order more in the future.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Makes a wonderful soak for tired and achey muscles such as legs and back pain. I have felt tingly after taking a bath with this.</li>
    <li> The Mineral Dead Sea Salt is surprisingly better than the ordinary sea salt I usually buy.</li>
    <li> Mathew 5:9, &amp;#34;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God</li>
    <li> I have been using Epsoms salt baths for many years to relax and invigorate.  I have read where the Dead Sea salt contains additional minerals and decided to order some.  Although the latter is more expensive per pound compared to the Epsoms, I figured it was worth a try. Combined both salts and scented with lavender oil (also an AMAZON purchase) for a truly heavenly soak.  Also created my own salt scrub by mixing with body oils (borage, grapeseed, rose hip, etc. also AMAZON vendors).  Sit on the edge of the tub, moisten your skin and apply the scrub all over-- before you hit the water and allow the crystals to work their magic.  Soak at least 12 minutes for ultimate benefit.  BTW, the oil scrub does not make my skin greasy.</li>
    <li> This product has so many health benefits.  Helped with my eczema and acne prone skin. Also makes for a wonderful relaxing bath with no harsh fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great Bath. Great Service !</li>
    <li> I love this Dead Sea Salt, have always been using it.</li>
    <li> This is a Great authentic product. Love it. As far as smell, the odor is decent or even odorless, I can&#x27;t smell any sulfur. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> A must have product for anyone with psoriasis or eczema.</li>
    <li> I use this sea salt to make saline solution to care for my body piercings and it works great. Nice packaging and consistency. I&#x27;d order this product again ;-)</li>
    <li> My itching stopped. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I used this in conjunction with a salt system for my hot tub (TechniChlor 110 Hot Tub and Spa Saltwater System Chorine Generator). Definitely DON&#x27;T use as much as they say to use. Add a little at a time until the salt system tells you there&#x27;s enough. Makes our hot tub water very soft and pleasant on our skin. I don&#x27;t use chemicals anymore to adjust the water - it just doesn&#x27;t need it!</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product.  I have purchased magnesium chloride flakes from other companies but this one is my favorite.  This product is helping my skin feel softer and less itchy.  It is also helping decrease my migraine headaches.  I have been applying it to my scalp to help with migraines and to my surprise my hair is growing back nice and thick.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This salt is fabulous in the bathtub and makes for a spalike experience.  It does come a little stuck together, but all in all a good quality dead seat salt.  I mix with epsom salt for an after workout soak and skin rejuvination and it works wonders.  Totally relaxing, and you do float in the tub.  I use probably 4 cups at a time and this bag lasts me for about 8 or 9 baths.  Worth the money for me when I compare it to going to a real actual spa for soaks and exfoliation and things.</li>
    <li> Relaxing!!! Slept like a baby after soaking in my Sea Salt Bath!</li>
    <li> Great product that keeps my psoriasis under control.  I was skeptical that it would help, but it far exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Great for toddler eczema.  Almost calms skin instantly after soak.  Most reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Everyone I have given samples to now worships me..sorry god, unintended side effect.</li>
    <li> Out of desperation I tried this product to help with a skin rash that my doctor could not identify.  It came well packaged - I wasn&#x27;t worried about the bag breaking at all.  It was also resealable so I didn&#x27;t worry about keeping it in my bathroom and having it clump up  with the higher humidity. I wasn&#x27;t sure that it was really helping, so I quit buying it.</li>
    <li> We use this in my sons bath, have been using it since he&#x27;s been 4mos old. He has excema and hives breakouts and this salt In his bath keeps him clear. It&#x27;s been a miracle for us. Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> We purchased this because our son who developed eczema behind the knees had gotten an infection. We were prescribed an oral antibiotic called duricef. Within 3 days his whole body exploded in eczema. Sea salt baths every 2-3 hours and aquaphor helped lots. Now we do daily sea salt baths and  his skin has cleared about 80%. We will always keep this in the house and use sea salt baths now. We are now using unrefined emu oil as a topical moisturizer. It makes his skin like silk. Beware of tea tree oil in the bath, it completely worsened him. I now use raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar in the sea salt bath and no soaps or cleansers. It&#x27;s not neccesary. Also if hour child is suffering or you are search facebook and join groups for your skin conditions. Most are marked as &amp;#34;closed&amp;#34; which means private from your friends and newsfeed. There are lots of people who can share information to help you. Don&#x27;t do this without support.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had psoriasis for over a year now and finally got tired of using steroids and other ointments. So, I remembered hearing that dead sea salt was good for psoriasis and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I was skeptical at first, but after reading other comments and researching why dead sea salt was good for you I bought a 10lb bag. After using the salt for a couple weeks I&#x27;ve noticed vast improvement. My psoriasis is almost completely clear and I hope in another couple weeks it will be. Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that the rest of my skin has improved and feels better. The dead sea salt also relieves stress and helps sleep! Finally, I don&#x27;t have much acne but the little I did have is gone and I haven&#x27;t had any new acne either. Overall, this product with help with many skin conditions and is great even if you don&#x27;t have any. All of this is coming from a 21 year old male who doesn&#x27;t usually believe in all nature anything and hasn&#x27;t written a single review for any other product. In summary, great product for anyone with skin and anyone who would like a little relaxation.</li>
    <li> Has helped my eczema more than any other treatment including prescriptions! So happy!</li>
    <li> I love this salt. Salt baths really help my daughter&#x27;s eczema.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis &amp; got this for a natural help.  I put a cup in bath water and soak for 15 minutes.  After just 2 uses my skin has never been this soft!!!  I am 63 and that&#x27;s saying a lot.  At the price, it&#x27;s well worth it.  It says it&#x27;s supposed to help to relax your muscles as well and help  with acne too.  I just know I feel good getting out of the 15 minute soak.  I usually take showers, but this has me taking soaking baths too.  Highly recommend!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product and great delivery as always.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;re looking for if you&#x27;re interested in a salt bath soak.  The bag that it comes in is thick plastic that didn&#x27;t tear in delivery, with a thick band at the top to allow for easy closing.  The salt is unscented, as advertised, so aromatherapy seekers should look at their scented lines instead. 20lbs is a great amount, not too huge that it sticks out in the bathroom, but plenty to last you a long time. Very pleased with my order.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by someone who also suffers from plaque psoriasis.  About a cup or two in a warm bath, soak for 20-30 minutes and the itch and redness is relieved. It may not be a cute but it alleviates the redness and itch</li>
    <li> love the soaks and YES! it works</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have used it for sea salt scrubs and for bath salt products with essential oils, or alone. couldn&#x27;t be happier with the price and huge bag! It will last you a while!</li>
    <li> We have always used Epsoms Salts for soaking our feet however we have adverse reactions to sulfates to we had to quit using it.  I am very happy to find this product although I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet from everything I have read I am sure this will work wonderful for us.</li>
    <li> I developed a bad rash about 2 months ago - I&#x27;ve been to several doctors who essentially shotgun their diagnosis by throwing expensive steroid creams and lotions at me - none of which has worked. I had to take a business trip to Hawaii and while there enjoyed the beach - and noticed a marked improvement in my rash - so much so that I gave up the creams and lotions - along with the ineffective and overpriced doctors as well....I decided that sea water was more beneficial than all those high priced creams. In order to try and simulate the ocean water, I purchased this product. This is not Epsom salt - that had no effect - this on the other hand has almost wiped out the rash entirely at a fraction of the cost of the useless doctors and their overpriced creams....I&#x27;m glad I found this stuff and have recommended this to others on other websites</li>
    <li> Awesome that I can have this delivered to my door. I really like the fine texture -- it mixes well with essential oils and dissolves right away in water. For me, this is the easiest way to get magnesium in my system, which is essential for a healthy heart. Wonderful side effects are no more eczema, clearer skin, no leg cramps, and, in this time of drought, a wonderful fertilizer for my plants. I re-use my bath water (it takes six minutes to fill my bathtub, hard to take a six-minute shower) for my outside plants, and they love the boost of magnesium.</li>
    <li> This salt has proven to help my dermatitis by soaking in a warm bathtub for about twenty minutes.  This was my second order and plan to order more in the future.  Your package arrived two days sooner than expected!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Been thru chemo a few times and this soak is awesome- i can feel it soaking into my cells and relaxing me as well as making me feel restored!&lt;br /&gt;Try it you will like it!</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery!  The product is absolutely wonderful!!  I will be ordering this for any years to come now that I tried it!</li>
    <li> These salts are awesome.I have arthritis really bad in my hands and feet,after soaking for 20 minutes before bed I can enjoying sleeping.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Arrived on time and the quality exceed expectations.  Reordering again</li>
    <li> Quality at a great price</li>
    <li> I love these Dead Sea salts and this is a very sharp price for them. Customer service was flawless, order with confidence!</li>
    <li> Ive purchased this product twice now.  It is delivered quickly .  I use it for salt baths for psoriasis.  It helps a lot and doesnt dry out my skin.  Its much gentler than Epsom salts.  I think anyway ;)</li>
    <li> This salt is the real deal. It helps with my daughters psoriasis</li>
    <li> Good price, and fast delivery</li>
    <li> This product is great for soaking sore muscles and even better face wash to remove dead skin.</li>
    <li> Harvested from the southern Dead Sea, San Francisco&#x27;s Minera Dead Sea Salt is 100% pure, nothing has been added, nothing has been refined out.  For a therapy bath, pour 2 cups into your bath water and soak for 20 minutes. Always rinse after using Dead Sea Salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick web search pulled up  many benefits of using Dead Sea Salt as a therapy soak.&lt;br /&gt;It treats  psoriasis, skin allergies, acne, hives, cellulite, dandruff, arthritis, back pain,  &amp; is a recognized cure for stress, insomnia &amp; related conditions. San Fransisco Salt Company&#x27;s web site provides information on a few clinical research studies which  tested the therapeutic properties of Dead Sea salts.  More clinical studies can be found by doing a web search.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opting for a relaxing bath, I added a handful to my bath water. It dissolved quickly &amp; had a slight mineral scent. A few small pieces of inorganic material were left in the bottom of the tub after the water was drained. After reading of the osteoarthritis benefits, I decided that I am going to soak my hand to relieve inflammation &amp; will update my review with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been provided several types of San Fransisco Salt Company products for review &amp; have been so impressed with their quality that I have purchased more for gifts.  My next purchase will be for me &amp; my family!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shelf life: 10 years&lt;br /&gt;Satisfaction Guaranteed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for an unbiased, honest review.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, almost through the whole bag and going to surely order another one.  Very clean salt and comes in a solid resealable bag.</li>
    <li> My sister had been trying to get me to try this on my daughter for the last 2 years, but I didn&#x27;t think it would work.  She suffers from some VERY itchy eczema all over her hands, feet, and legs.  She&#x27;s about to be 4 years old and this summer the eczema just seemed to get worse and worse.  The steroids weren&#x27;t keeping up with the itching.  At a recent doctor&#x27;s visit my pediatrician suggested we give this a try so I decided to just do it.  I AM SO GLAD I DID.  I used about 1 1/2-2 cups in a very full bath so she could really get the benefits all over her skin.  After she got out I lotioned her down while still slightly wet like our dermatologist has advised to do.  You could IMMEDIATELY tell the difference!  It was like she had soft skin again!  I could still feel the patches of dry skin from the eczema, but they just weren&#x27;t as bad and my daughter went through the night without scratching!  And the next day (after more lotion of course) she was scratching a lot less - sometimes not at all.  We give her a salt bath every other night and it has made a big difference.  The eczema is still there, but it seems to bother her less as long as I stay on top of the baths (nice long 30 minute soak) and the moisturizing.  This is worth a try for anyone with an eczema kid!</li>
    <li> Great seller, fast shipping. The salt is pure and is great for my skin. One or two pounds of it in a hot bath and you get the benefits of a thermal bath at home.</li>
    <li> I am currently experiencing topical steroid withdrawal. I had a small amount of eczema that was treated with topical steroids prescribed by my dermatologist. It worked for a while.. but then it didn&#x27;t. So he gave me stronger steroids. They worked for a while too. Then they didn&#x27;t. It got to the point that the lower portion of both legs as well as the backs of both hands were covered in an oozy mess of red raw skin. Gross, painful, itchy. I found Itsan.org and decided to stop using topical steroids. I am almost 5 months off them and I wish I had discovered Dead Sea Salt sooner. My skin has cleared up quite a bit from five months ago. I rarely have ooze any more and my legs are about 70% healed. I start every morning with a Dead Sea salt bath. I go through so much of this stuff. It helps dry up any ooze. It helps prevent and treat infection. It makes my skin much happier. I honestly couldn&#x27;t care less how much it costs, I love it that much. I haven&#x27;t tried other brands, so don&#x27;t actually know how it compares to similar brands.</li>
    <li> This is lovely!  It arrived very quickly too.  Yes I have a Prime account, but rarely have I been able to recieve 2 day shipping because of one reason or another.  With this shipper, San Francisco Salt Company, I recieved it within 2 days, fabulous!  It came well packaged.  I love that the bag is resealable.  The texture of the salt is nice and fine, it dissolves quickly in the tub and I am so glad I purchased this.  I also greatly appreciate that this salt is scent free.  I cannot tolerate many scents, essential oils, and the like on my skin, I am highly allergic.  This salt had no noticeable scent and I will purchase again.</li>
