### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great!</li>
      <li>OPI is the BEST.</li>
      <li>Its spendy but the girls know best anyway.</li>
      <li>I had been using Paying By Platinum by Spoiled (Wet&amp;Wild, with excellent viscosity and the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used).</li>
      <li>It is beautiful!</li>
      <li>and I haven&#x27;t yet seen the excellent product everyone else seems to be describing.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll love this color!!!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
      <li>this polish is beautiful in color and in its texture.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a beautiful color.</li>
      <li>all a great buy.</li>
      <li>BLAHHHH and non attractive combination of colors-</li>
      <li>It has a great glimmer to it.  </li>
      <li>so I was thrilled when I found what looked like a perfect match in Not Like The Movies.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>This nail polish is amazing!</li>
      <li>At best, glitter is overkill on top of this already gloriously metallic, dichroic surface.</li>
      <li>Turns out it&#x27;s not quite perfect; NLTM has fine, silver glitter in it, which the Spoiled version does not.</li>
      <li>The colour combo looks SO gorgeous when applied.</li>
      <li>This is a fabulous color(s)!!</li>
      <li>I spend honest to Gods</li>
      <li>Looks really nice.</li>
      <li>Nice, always got compliments</li>
      <li>I put off purchasing the cnd shellac uv light system because I love this right now!!!!!</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, it turns out to be the PERFECT color to have the black shatter applied to, and this redeemed the polish for me, because its irridescence is PERFECT for the shattering effect, and I receieve many compliments on it.</li>
      <li>It looks amazing on nails and gets a lot of attention :)</li>
      <li>This is the most unique color I own and it&#x27;s gorgeous.</li>
      <li>I saw this color and fell in love.</li>
      <li>so I thought I&#x27;d try \\&quot;regular\\&quot; OPI and see if it was better, but this one sucked too.</li>
      <li>nice color changing steel gray with a shimmer, that changes colors (silver/gold/black/gray) depending on the light.</li>
      <li>However I have to say it looks better in the picture than it does on your nails.</li>
      <li>Definitely an interesting color.  </li>
      <li>daylight brings out the most contrast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love the fact it has not chipped at all in four days.the color isn&#x27;t what I thought it was</li>
      <li>I would purchase this item many times over.would recommend it to anyone</li>
      <li>And who doesnt love Katie Perry.</li>
      <li>Love this nail polish.  </li>
      <li>Love the color.</li>
      <li>Dream\\&quot; over the top.</li>
      <li>Thanks for your great service.</li>
      <li>OPI is just amazing with the shades and &#x27;textures&#x27; they offer, from ultra rich cream, dreamy pearlescent and frosty shimmer/glimmer.  </li>
      <li>It got here faster than I expected and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is by far my favorite color ever!!  </li>
      <li>Very quick.</li>
      <li>Beautiful color looks different from every angle.</li>
      <li>i am so glad i didnt buy the full sized bottle.</li>
      <li>but honestly it seems to be more of an autumn shade rather than too wild to wear to work.   </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t chip, and provides fantastic coverage.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Depending on the direction of light, the color changes from lavender to olive.</li>
      <li>i gave to someone who would enjoy it.</li>
      <li>The polish went on smoothly.</li>
      <li>Granted, the OPI version surely came first and Spoiled was the knockoff, but I think the Spoiled design was an improvement.</li>
      <li>As a woman who loves the range of iridescents that OPI offers, I can safely say that this is in my top 5.  </li>
      <li>It was only made acceptable with the addition of Seche Vite top coat (which is a marvel in its own</li>
      <li>Under flourescent lighting (which I&#x27;m under most of the time) it looks like a goldish purple, which I don&#x27;t really care for.</li>
      <li>Depending on how many coats you apply this can look very different and lovely each way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Put on a nice wet finish top coat that makes it ultra shiny</li>
      <li>enjoy;)</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a very pleasing light color (with light pinkish purple and green iridescent tones) that looks great on my shorter nails.  </li>
      <li>very shinny the colors reflect off the light looks like</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s amazing if only because it&#x27;s OPI.  </li>
      <li>This is one of those polishes that you can mix and match and just have fun with.</li>
      <li>only reason I didn&#x27;t give this color 5/5 stars was because my wife doesn&#x27;t appear to be as enamored with this color as some of the others, though she still liked</li>
      <li>This OPI polish is so pretty, completely worth it.</li>
      <li>The shipping was fast enough, and packaging was nice too.</li>
      <li>This polish is exactly like PRISMZ by S.H. Nail Color.</li>
      <li>Really this is such a pretty color had many people compliment on this goes on</li>
      <li>a touch of green pink blended in with the silver can wear with just about anything awesome Opi color.</li>
      <li>Depending on the way the light hits your nails, it will look greenish or purplish; It has a light grey color overall, and it&#x27;s just fantastic</li>
      <li>(the brush certainly is inferior)</li>
      <li>Too bad it just isn&#x27;t durable enough to look perfect for more than a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Is the real stuff</li>
      <li>Much appreciated.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d heard that OPI was very hard-wearing nail polish</li>
      <li>very well</li>
      <li>i want to give away the mini, thats how much i dislike this color</li>
      <li>The pictures of it really don&#x27;t give it any justice, you have to see it for yourself.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear it much.</li>
      <li>Thanks again</li>
      <li>Really neat color.</li>
      <li>As with all OPI polishes it goes on smoothly and dries quickly, giving you a silvery pearl high tone with an iris purple undertone and the iridescent lilac and pale green shimmer that is very eye catching.  </li>
      <li>If you like cool visual effects, I would recommend this nail polish.</li>
      <li>so precious that unscrupulous sellers are watering it down?</li>
      <li>OPI is a very thick nailpolish which goes on so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t run like some more liquid-y polish will.  </li>
      <li>I used two coats and always I use a top coat it lasted about a week and a half.</li>
      <li>In the picture this color looks mainly lavender.</li>
      <li>but it is still very pretty and different..</li>
      <li>The brush is marginally better than the standard drugstore ones, but it failed to impress me as it is nowhere near as good as the Spoiled brush.</li>
      <li>Love the underlying colors, but have to deduct a star for missing perfection by a hair because of the glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have to say that when I first bought the bottle, I was more expecting a gunmetal grey with a GREEN shimmer.</li>
      <li>Typical OPI quality which is always fantastic.</li>
      <li>Probably sounds ugly, but it&#x27;s lovely and gothy, interesting without screaming for attention.  </li>
      <li>It can be used as a wash over other colors, and is very pretty when used that way -- or by itself.</li>
      <li>Depending on the light, it can look green or purple.  </li>
      <li>i thought this color would be a silver with flashes of lavender and a light green.</li>
      <li>Aesthetically, the glitter interrupts the smooth, gradient flow of the dichroism and the contrast of silver specks on the dark background makes the surface look gritty.</li>
      <li>When the light hits it, you can see pink, yellow, and blue reflecting off of the silver.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is extra fun with a coat of pink sparkly \\&quot;Teenage</li>
      <li>Sometimes it looks slightly greenish purple, which is pretty.</li>
      <li>The nail polish is not exactly what I thought it would be, just a very blandt color: sort of greyish-silver w/ sparkles.</li>

    <li> The nail polish is not exactly what I thought it would be, just a very blandt color: sort of greyish-silver w/ sparkles. The shipping was fast enough, and packaging was nice too.</li>
    <li> was wrapped well with bubble wrap, didnt care for the color but thats not the sellers fault. i gave to someone who would enjoy it. thank you.</li>
    <li> Let me start of this way... I spend honest to Gods minutes moving my fingers to stare at the nail polish.    It is beautiful!</li>
    <li> I have to say that when I first bought the bottle, I was more expecting a gunmetal grey with a GREEN shimmer. But when I applied two coats the polish I noticed the polish oxidizes and becomes a lavendar color, which at first really disappointed me and upset me. HOWEVER, it turns out to be the PERFECT color to have the black shatter applied to, and this redeemed the polish for me, because its irridescence is PERFECT for the shattering effect, and I receieve many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color looks different from every angle. Was concerned about knock off OPI but this was legit! It took me about 3 coats to get it to a shade I like.</li>
    <li> Just to look at the bottle, I thought this would be a very dark color with purple and green iridescent tones.  Two coats, and it&#x27;s a very pleasing light color (with light pinkish purple and green iridescent tones) that looks great on my shorter nails.  It looks different in different lights...daylight brings out the most contrast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is extra fun with a coat of pink sparkly \\&quot;Teenage Dream\\&quot; over the top.</li>
    <li> I saw this color and fell in love. However I have to say it looks better in the picture than it does on your nails.</li>
    <li> This OPI polish is so pretty, completely worth it. This is the most unique color I own and it&#x27;s gorgeous. It got here faster than I expected and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Over all a great buy.</li>
    <li> I had a hard time with my rating on this polish because compared to nail polishes as a whole it&#x27;s amazing if only because it&#x27;s OPI.  OPI is a very thick nailpolish which goes on so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t run like some more liquid-y polish will.  But when comparing this polish to the other polishes in the Katy Perry line this one is my least favorite.  I like that it&#x27;s metallic and somewhat multi-faceted but as a whole it&#x27;s pretty boring.  I don&#x27;t wear it much.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous color(s)!! It changes from silver to green to purple. It looks amazing on nails and gets a lot of attention :)</li>
    <li> Nice, always got compliments</li>
    <li> I am honestly NOT impressed with this color. It is very similar to the color &amp;#34;Peace,Love, and Opi&amp;#34; but not as dynamic. I ended up gifting it away.</li>
    <li> Depending on how many coats you apply this can look very different and lovely each way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far my favorite color ever!!  I put off purchasing the cnd shellac uv light system because I love this right now!!!!!</li>
    <li> When I got the nail polish in the mail, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn&#x27;t just a plain silver nail polish. When the light hits it, you can see pink, yellow, and blue reflecting off of the silver. If you like cool visual effects, I would recommend this nail polish.</li>
    <li> I had used this product before &amp; just HAD to have it. The colour combo looks SO gorgeous when applied.</li>
    <li> i thought this color would be a silver with flashes of lavender and a light green. what i got was a metallic olive green with almost no lavender or silver. i am so glad i didnt buy the full sized bottle. i want to give away the mini, thats how much i dislike this color</li>
    <li> When I got this polish I was expecting one shade, and I was alright with that. But what I got was 3 shades in one polish. The pictures of it really don&#x27;t give it any justice, you have to see it for yourself. Depending on the way the light hits your nails, it will look greenish or purplish; It has a light grey color overall, and it&#x27;s just fantastic and I caught myself quite a few times staring at it.    Typical OPI quality which is always fantastic. Doesn&#x27;t chip, and provides fantastic coverage.</li>
    <li> In the bottle this looks like a dark smoke frost with iridescent shimmer, but when you get it on your nails it&#x27;s a whole different ball game.  As with all OPI polishes it goes on smoothly and dries quickly, giving you a silvery pearl high tone with an iris purple undertone and the iridescent lilac and pale green shimmer that is very eye catching.  Apply your second coat and you get a deeper, richer iris undertone and silvery shine with a fairytale quality shimmer with just a few flecks of silver glitz.  Put on a nice wet finish top coat that makes it ultra shiny and it&#x27;s beautiful. It sounds like it would be too dark but honestly it seems to be more of an autumn shade rather than too wild to wear to work.   As a woman who loves the range of iridescents that OPI offers, I can safely say that this is in my top 5.  OPI is just amazing with the shades and &#x27;textures&#x27; they offer, from ultra rich cream, dreamy pearlescent and frosty shimmer/glimmer.  You&#x27;ll love this color!!!</li>
    <li> This color is beautiful and looks like a purpleish silver depending on the color of the base coat. White base makes it look silver and dark base colors make it look purple. a clear base coat with two coats looks like those cars that change color when they drive past. Depending on the angle you look at it changes from green to purple to silver. Really neat color. The polish has to be at least two coats thick to lose the transparancy but it&#x27;s a beautiful color. This is one of those polishes that you can mix and match and just have fun with. enjoy;)</li>
    <li> This nail polish is amazing! The picture does not give it the credit it deserves. It is grey with a slight shimmer that shifts to a violet color and a green color and it is opaque in two or three coats</li>
    <li> Not quite what I expected, still wear it from time to time.</li>
    <li> I used this nail polish before and the color inside is nothing to do what I had before. May be .....</li>
    <li> Love the color. Matches with everything  and as irredescent, it changes with the outfits you wear. Hard to find and of course it is dicontinued</li>
    <li> this polish is beautiful in color and in its texture. I would purchase this item many times over.would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> Love the fact it has not chipped at all in four days.the color isn&#x27;t what I thought it was but it is still very pretty and different..I&#x27;ve received complements on it also.</li>
    <li> nice color changing steel gray with a shimmer, that changes colors (silver/gold/black/gray) depending on the light. It can be used as a wash over other colors, and is very pretty when used that way -- or by itself. I like to use it as a tip color on my nails. Looks really nice.</li>
    <li> This polish is exactly like PRISMZ by S.H. Nail Color. Except S.H. shades are beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on the direction of light, the color changes from lavender to olive. The pic is very deceiving; due to the base being silver, the first sheer coat is silver, but the more coats, the deeper pigments take over. BLAHHHH and non attractive combination of colors- my opinion</li>
    <li> One layer of this will not do.  It&#x27;ll make your nails look dirty so you need 2 coats.  This is a gunmetal grey color with silver sparkles in it.  Depending on the angle you&#x27;ll see flashes of purple and green.  Definitely an interesting color.  The polish went on smoothly.</li>
    <li> I had been using Paying By Platinum by Spoiled (Wet&amp;Wild, with excellent viscosity and the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used). I adore the color - it hauntingly mimics an oil slick on a puddle, with its asphalt-gray depth and a surface that throws lavender and a soft olive green depending on the light. Probably sounds ugly, but it&#x27;s lovely and gothy, interesting without screaming for attention.  Too bad it just isn&#x27;t durable enough to look perfect for more than a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d heard that OPI was very hard-wearing nail polish so I was thrilled when I found what looked like a perfect match in Not Like The Movies. Turns out it&#x27;s not quite perfect; NLTM has fine, silver glitter in it, which the Spoiled version does not. At best, glitter is overkill on top of this already gloriously metallic, dichroic surface. Conceptually, oil slicks shouldn&#x27;t have glitter in them. Aesthetically, the glitter interrupts the smooth, gradient flow of the dichroism and the contrast of silver specks on the dark background makes the surface look gritty. Granted, the OPI version surely came first and Spoiled was the knockoff, but I think the Spoiled design was an improvement. Love the underlying colors, but have to deduct a star for missing perfection by a hair because of the glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why only two stars? I could live with the glitter, but I hated the quality of the OPI lacquer. It is so watery that it runs and pools up against my cuticles no matter how careful I am, and produces very uneven coverage. It manages to exaggerate every ridge (yeah, I know about ridge filler but my other, CHEAPER, polishes are forgiving enough that the surface is passably smooth for everyday wear without). The brush is marginally better than the standard drugstore ones, but it failed to impress me as it is nowhere near as good as the Spoiled brush. Overall, fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my third experience with OPI nail lacquer and I haven&#x27;t yet seen the excellent product everyone else seems to be describing.One of the two previous bottles I bought was also watery and extremely difficult to control. I thought perhaps Sephora by OPI was an inferior product (the brush certainly is inferior) so I thought I&#x27;d try \\&quot;regular\\&quot; OPI and see if it was better, but this one sucked too. It was only made acceptable with the addition of Seche Vite top coat (which is a marvel in its own right).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label on the bottom is printed in green and the brush has \\&quot;OPI\\&quot; embossed on it. These are supposed to be signs that the product is genuine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is OPI supposed to be watery? Is their quality control inconsistent? Is the real stuff so precious that unscrupulous sellers are watering it down? What&#x27;s going on?</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife. she loves it. Its spendy but the girls know best anyway. And who doesnt love Katie Perry.</li>
    <li> Really this is such a pretty color had many people compliment on this goes on very well I used two coats and always I use a top coat it lasted about a week and a half. very shinny the colors reflect off the light looks like a touch of green pink blended in with the silver can wear with just about anything awesome Opi color.</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish.  Depending on the light, it can look green or purple.  It has a great glimmer to it.  Wear it on my toes and finger nails.  Great!</li>
    <li> I frequently purchase OPI Nail Lacquer for my wife, who is 28 and enjoys OPI products because they coat well and last longer than other brands (whether more or less expensive).  You know you&#x27;re getting something that&#x27;s going to last a bit longer with OPI, and of course this color/line doesn&#x27;t deviate from that standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this color 5/5 stars was because my wife doesn&#x27;t appear to be as enamored with this color as some of the others, though she still liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think she cared that it was from the Katie Perry Collection, and neither did I.  Regardless, it&#x27;s a quality product.</li>
    <li> Great product. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend any other polish. OPI is the BEST. Thanks for your great service. Very quick. Much appreciated. Thanks again</li>
    <li> In the picture this color looks mainly lavender. Under flourescent lighting (which I&#x27;m under most of the time) it looks like a goldish purple, which I don&#x27;t really care for. Sometimes it looks slightly greenish purple, which is pretty.</li>
