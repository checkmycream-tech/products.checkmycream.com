    <li> I use to get a full biosilk package for 30 bucks at Jc penny, considering that, the silk therapy should have been around 15, I´m not quite sure about the size though, still the product is authentic and in reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried those products that say &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;compared to&amp;#34; and you know what?  They don&#x27;t cut it at all. They are either too thin, too thick or too greasy.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. My hair is really frizzy and curly. When i straighten it, it still is a puff of hair and has some friz. I use this and it makes it smooth, makes it feel less dry, and holds my hair down so it doesnt look puffy. I love it</li>
    <li> I use this every time I wash my hair.  Lasts forever.  Really softens the hair and repairs.  Would be good on colored hair.</li>
    <li> I like the way it smells and the way it makes my hair feel.  I do have to be careful and not add too much or it will look greasy but overall very satisfied (this the second bottle for me and we&#x27;ll worth the cost)</li>
    <li> I first bought this item for myself a couple of years ago and now my husband likes the way it feels on his hair.  Great item!</li>
    <li> I was surprised to receive it so quickly. It came the next day as promised! I have been using it regularly and I really like it. I will order more from you. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Biosilk Silk Therapy for years.  I have fine hair and the blow dryer does a number on it.  When I use the serum, it keeps my baby fine hair nice and soft and no fly-aways.  I love this product.</li>
    <li> she had thick hair and she says it works really well. she uses it while her hair it wet and on her ends when her hair is dry.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and get it highlighted regularly. With all the dying, blow drying and straightening i do my hair gets dry and frizzy. This product works great and my hair is back to feeling soft and silky again. I used it everyday before i blow dry. I definately recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years and have never found anything that works as well as it does!! I have also found an additional use for it as well. Dry feet in the summer put a small amount in your hand rub on heels and feet and they are baby smooth! Highly recommend this product to everyone![[ASIN:B003E0YX5Q Farouk: BioSilk Silk Therapy, 12 oz]]</li>
    <li> Good product. Worth buying the big bottle considering how expensive is the tiny one in some stores. It smells wonderfull also. Usually, after putting it in my hair, i rub my hands together and use the left overs as hand lotion :-D</li>
    <li> Have used this product before and am very satisfied as I live in a humid, hot climate and have frizzy hair. It does wonders for my hair. This was a reorder.</li>
    <li> Price is a little scary at first, but this bottle will last you forever. I&#x27;ve had it since Christmas, it&#x27;s now May, and I&#x27;m maybe 1/8 through the bottle and I use it on my long hair nearly everyday. Makes my hair shiny, soft and healthy. A little greasy in your hands but cleans up easily with a quick wipe with a towel.</li>
    <li> Great product! Really makes my hair feel smooth and silky. Simply put a small amount in palm and mesage in. Works wonder on dry, frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> I blow dry and flat iron my curly hair 1-2 times a month and sometimes after I wash out my hair I can see the damaging affects that the heat has caused and so I needed something to help treat and repair it back to good health. I like to only use this after I have gone through the whole long process of blow drying and flat ironing my hair. After I rinse my hair and it&#x27;s damp (not dripping wet) I apply a small amount to my hair, focusing on the ends.  My hair has never looked any better than when I use this, it gives me a natural shine when completely dried and my hair so soft! I&#x27;ve noticed that since this is a treatment I only use it once to twice a week or else my curls will not benefit from it and will look even frizzier than before. But it truly is awesome to use when you feel you&#x27;re hair needs some tlc. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I use this product in the following manner: After washing my hair, I pour just a little in the palm of my hand, rub my hands together and pass my hands over my hair working it in towards the root. It give my hair a resistance to dryness; it gives my hair a softness and gentleness despite the hair spray I may apply.</li>
    <li> Good product. Only need a drop so it should last you a long time.  If you have short hair you probably only need the smaller size.</li>
    <li> I got some biosilk from this company, when i received it the bottle was black and looked used. I thought maybe it got ruined with heat or something plus it had a seal. So I didnt think anything of it and opened it to use it I noticed it didnt smell the same as it normal does. when I poured out it was so runny and smelled so bad. When I tryed to email I got a reply with I have to pay for shipping and express mail and they will refund only if not opened. so therefore Im writing this email to let everyone know dont by from this company. There product is bad and not at all what it should be!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my long hair since 1995. It smells wonderful. leaves a wonderful sheen on the hair and takes out the tangles.</li>
    <li> This is not fake Biosilk.  It came with a plastic wrap over the bottle and a seal over the opening.  It&#x27;s thick and smells like the real thing.  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than the beauty supply store. My natural hair soak it all up. Not too greasy doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down</li>
    <li> great product, real a huge plus for my hair. Hair dresser turned me onto this with a small bottle.  Had to order a large.  shipped on time and without issue.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products of this kind and I can assure  you this one is the best! Even at the hair dresser I receive compliments on the texture of my hair when I wear this. I would recommended to everyone!</li>
    <li> My sisters and I are half black with the often testy mixed hair that comes along with it- and we&#x27;ve been using and loving this stuff for almost 10 years now. I apply BioSilk when my hair is wet &amp; before applying mousse- my hair is so much shinier and less frizzy when curly. When I plan on using heat tools, I wait until after I use the flat iron to apply, to the ends mainly- it really helps guard against humidity and keep my hair soft and shiny, PLUS it smells wonderful and counters the &amp;#34;flat iron&amp;#34; smoky smell that comes with using heat on my hair.</li>
    <li> When my hair turned white in my older years it became dry and dull.  A small amount of Bio Silk put the moisture and shine back and gave better control.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used BioSilk in the past and do like it. I find with my curly hair that I have to be careful not to use too much BioSilk because it tends to drag the curls out of my hair!</li>
    <li> I love this product for my hair.  after washing, I put a small amount into my wet hair as a leave in treatment.  I dry my hair and that&#x27;s it for the day.  thank you----great price on this item.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It smells amazing and leaves my hair shiny without looking greasy. I use it after straightening to finish it off and just a little dab goes far.</li>
    <li> Since I was given this for a birthday over three years ago, I&#x27;ve been hooked on the product. Lasts a long time and leaves your hair feeling healthy and manageable.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product. Use a little and it goes long way. One bottle will last at least one year</li>
    <li> I have used biosilk for years. I color my baby fine hair, and biosilk keeps its soft and shiny. I need to use very little so the bottle last a long time.</li>
    <li> This has saved my hair. I am a white women but have hair the is not very managable. I don&#x27;t care for my hair at all, it is course and my scalp is very dry. I have used this for years and swear by it. It leaves my hair soft, my scalp not so itchy and I love the way it smells. Each bottle lasts about 9 months to a year. I have medium to long length hair.  I am very pleased with what it has done for me. I also have highlights in my hair and it doesn&#x27;t effect them at all.</li>
    <li> It gives my hair much better texture, more silky and nicer drape.  I was really glad to find this product.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is pretty strong;  some people could not use it because of the fragrance.  Some of my friends might not be able to be around me because of the fragrance.  It would help to have a fragrance free version of Biosilk.</li>
    <li> Great therapy treatment that doesn&#x27;t make your hair heavy or greasy.  Only small amounts are needed.  If you accidentally put on too much, it still doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy, it just takes longer to be absorbed in.  It&#x27;s also great to use on rough patches of skin.  I combined this product with Biotin, so eventually I will only need to use Biosilk after hairstyling.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser gave me a small bottle after a hair disaster and I can&#x27;t live without it now. Makes even the worst hair look good!</li>
    <li> I like this service, it delives on time&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this service to my colleague&lt;br /&gt;and will buy some product when I needed for sure.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome ! Use on your hair to keep smooth as silk,also making hair stronger. Can also be used on your skin.Has a pleasant scent. Using over 15 yrs !</li>
    <li> This is the way to go if you use this as much as I do!  Again, half the price of the salons!</li>
    <li> I heard about this product on an amateur hair review video that I saw on Youtube.com.  The video host had great hair and she recommended using the product (I only briefly remember previously hearing about it on TV...) but I figured that I would check it out since I was looking for a good leave in product, so I purchased it on Amazon.  Overall, the product has been GREAT!!!  I like the fact that it&#x27;s a good price, it smells good, it&#x27;s clear, it&#x27;s light, it leaves a little bit of a shine on my hair, and I&#x27;ve noticed hair growth, increased volume and overall healthy hair since using it.  I would definitely purchase the product again and I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I started using this when every other leave in conditioner wasnt working for my curly hair. My sister was using it for a while and she had me try some out and it leaves my hair so soft, withuot tangles and best part is I dont need to out anything to keep my hair from getting frizzy.</li>
    <li> This one works better than most presently on the market some charging an unbievable price. You will get the money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
