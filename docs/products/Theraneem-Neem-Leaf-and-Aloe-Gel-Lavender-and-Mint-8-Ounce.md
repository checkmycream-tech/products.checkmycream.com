      <li>I had no negative reactions again.  </li>
      <li>I quickly took a wet cloth, gently wiped and dabbed it off of my face and neck, and applied some of my go-to lotion for eczema.  </li>

      <li>HOWEVER, let me caution you about this gel:  If your skin is sensitive like mine, DO NOT USE ON THE FACE!  </li>
      <li>I found the scalp conditioner at my local health store, and I was interested in the scalp care.  </li>
      <li>But as is common with eczema, it works great for a while, then it&#x27;s becomes a little sporadic or doesn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
      <li>My skin is oily and slightly sensitive.  </li>
      <li>it is the Mint in this product that is causing this \\&quot;burn\\&quot; in my sensitive skin.  </li>

      <li>(It&#x27;s ALL sensitive.)  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it! As a physician and vain human being-I&#x27;ll say I noticed the ingredient list and had to try. I&#x27;m thrilled with the results. I&#x27;ve bought several extra bottles giving them to my family and close friends for multiple reasons as listed.&lt;br /&gt;It says to apply on face w caution. I absolutely love it from head to toe but would suggest heavier application to feet or troubled skin on the torso, then applying the excess over face gently. I went through the first bottle in just a few weeks. It&#x27;s been roughly 3 mos now. Effects?&lt;br /&gt;Tighter skin, improved elasticity, decrease dryness, less inflammation or &#x27;flaky, red skin, complete resolution of callouses on feet, improved nail and cuticle health (pedicure in a bottle)&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are natural antimicrobials, so would work theoretically for body acne particularly (but I can&#x27;t comment on that by experience).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve paid a lot of money and received less quality than this many times before.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item with the original Theraneem body lotion as an alternative between the two.  This one has Natural Aloe Vera and Mint added to it which adds to the healing powers and the fragrance is great.  It also works well on most skin irritations and prevents fleas and mosquitoes from &#x27;biting&#x27; the skin surface.  A natural skin care product with insect repellent properties, what&#x27;s not to like.</li>
    <li> Nope. I got this for my occasional acne and skin rashes. This actually GAVE me a rash.  No therapeutic effects, and really expensive. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! It clears up acne on my back wonderfully and soothes skin from bug bites. It also seems to smooth out bumps on my skin.</li>
    <li> Use this daily!!!  It is light and greaseless.  Has helped with many skin issues that were frustrating me.  I will always use this!</li>
    <li> very pleasant smell and stop mosquito bites .Also soothes itching over all does what its designed to do.</li>
    <li> I love these Neem products.  (However, read to the end for the warning...)  I bought this gel, the scalp shampoo, and scalp conditioner for my multiple forms of eczema.  I have atopic dermatitis, sebborheic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, and keratosis pilaris that wreak havoc on my body.  I found the scalp conditioner at my local health store, and I was interested in the scalp care.  Not many shampoos and conditioners are focused on the scalp.  So, I decided to try three of this brand&#x27;s products.  Well, I have a prescription and other products that I buy and use to make my skin bearable to live in.  But as is common with eczema, it works great for a while, then it&#x27;s becomes a little sporadic or doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Well, I did research on Neem, and it sounded promising.  I will try anything to attempt to get away from my corticosteroid prescription that I know is not good for me as I am someone that is all about All-Natural products.  But I must use it or watch my face break out into painful, itchy, red, raw skin.  What I liked about Neem oil is it is not only GREAT for scalp sebum, but it&#x27;s great for eczema, psoriasis, AND hair!  So, I have VERY positive results thus far with the shampoo and conditioner.  HOWEVER, let me caution you about this gel:  If your skin is sensitive like mine, DO NOT USE ON THE FACE!  It says it on the bottle to be careful about putting it on the face.  HEED THIS WARNING!  I wish it warned what it would do to your face and the front of your neck!  I did heed the warning in that:  First, I put a small portion on my lower leg...when I had no bad reaction, that night, I put it on my body and hair.  I had no negative reactions again.  I waited for two days before I put it on my face.  It took just a few minutes before I began to feel heat.  It felt like I had a fever.  I look in the mirror, and I may as well have been in the sun all day!  I quickly took a wet cloth, gently wiped and dabbed it off of my face and neck, and applied some of my go-to lotion for eczema.  I continued to apply the lotion while at work until every last trace of \\&quot;the burn\\&quot; was gone.  I did not realize until this reaction that the skin on my face and neck is any different that the rest of my body. (It&#x27;s ALL sensitive.)  But it must be different.  So, if you wish to use on your face and/or neck, try it in a small location and slowly add to this location until you are confident that it won&#x27;t \\&quot;burn\\&quot; your skin.  I have a feeling it is the Mint in this product that is causing this \\&quot;burn\\&quot; in my sensitive skin.  Therefore, be cautious!  But I also will add that I love using it on the rest of my body.  It soaks right in, and I receive many of the same benefits as my other go-to lotion.  I will probably alternate as, like I said, eczema is variable.  Some products work for a period of time, then you have to switch it up.  However, I did find some products that have lasted a few years with which I have been very pleased.  But I am still on the search for the product to replace my prescription for my face.  I am looking for something of the all-natural variety.  I have located some possibilities that I will try...</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t heard of the benefits to skin from Neem oil. I originally purchased it to use on my little dog, since Neem oil does a pretty good job of keeping insects away, but decided to use it for myself. Don&#x27;t worry, I have stuff for my doggie too. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to really say what it is doing, but I can say I have no complaints. It&#x27;s supposed to help with wrinkles, rashes and all kinds of things. We shall see, but it feels good and it smells good, to me.</li>
    <li> Love the way this glides on &amp; feels! The smell is very pleasant as well. I would reorder in the future.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s easy to use and provides gentle healing with a lovely clean smell. It&#x27;s not at all greasy or unpleasant.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and the problem with most moisturizers is that I break out in acne if I use it on my face. Using this product has helped my dry skin on my face with no problems with acne.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on the recommendation of a friend who said it helped her with extremely dry skin.  We both swim in an indoor pool and the chemicals are very drying.  I use the product under my regular moisturizer and it makes for an excellent team to fight chemical and winter dryness.  It&#x27;s a good product; on the pricey side however.</li>
    <li> wish i new about this sooner</li>
    <li> I bought this for my skin,,,, but it did say use on  hair too.... so I did, it is great.  I have fine thin hair and I love this stuff.  Gives me body and make my hair look much more healthy!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s and it makes my skin tight and gives it a nice tone.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.... helps with my sensitive skin...</li>
    <li> The ingredients are pure!&lt;br /&gt;Feels wonderful, even on your face!</li>
    <li> I love Theraneem Neem Leaf Aloe Gel. When I use this product on my face and neck it tightens my skin like the very expensive products they have on the market. Then you have to rinse it off. It is organic and, the other review says it all! I also rub some into my hands and, run my fingers through my hair when it feels dry. It can be used after you shampoo instead of using hairspray.  It is really making my hair look healthier and, hydrated.</li>
    <li> I will never be without this product again as long as the maker keeps it the way it is and doesn&#x27;t mess with it.  I have suffered with acne since I was a teenager.  I&#x27;ve tried store bought remedies, proactive, and other prescriptions that are caustic and harmful to the body.  I recently decided to stop assaulting my body with chemicals and went on a mission to find natural products (herbs, salves, whatever) that would help me.  I wasn&#x27;t looking to be cured per se but just given a boost.  I started washing my face with nubian heritage&#x27;s african black soap (with oats) and using the Theraneem leaf and aloe gel, lavender, and mint gel as my toner/moisturizer.  I have not had a big nasty pimple on my face since.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, sometimes, I&#x27;ll feel like a little breakout is on it&#x27;s way but with the use of this product, the breakout is minimalized and barely noticable. Oh, I also use an inexpensive facial sponge I to wash my face first (which opens up the pores and prepares them to take the medicine of the Theraneem product).  My skin is oily and slightly sensitive.  I will say however, you may need to be careful if your skin is very sensitive because the mint will burn you.  It just tingles for me and feels cooling as it dries on my skin. After it dries, if I feel I need a little more moisture,I&#x27;ll use less than a pea sized amount of shea lotion from Nubian Heritage.  Shea is an excellent moisturizer but I find if I don&#x27;t use a scant amount on my face, it will block my pores, and I&#x27;ll break out.  Anyhoo...overall, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Anything neem is gr8!</li>
    <li> This product works wonderfully. Keeps your skin soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> This gel is great, a little goes a long way &amp; that&#x27;s perfect!! I recommend a cream for extra protection during the day but at night the gel is perfect for the skin!! The smell is short lived though, I would have liked it to last much longer but there are creams that will benefit that way instead!!</li>
    <li> I have a combo of all three and i refuse to keep using expensive chemically induced products. I have only had this product for a month or so and i can truly see the difference. The smell isn&#x27;t as bad as others perceive it to be. To each their own, I&#x27;d rather have naturally glowing skin &amp; hair...</li>
    <li> I got this to try and moisturize and stimulate my shedding hair. Its the best combination of ingredients. My hair texture is 4G, lol the worst of all the textures. But this product actually makes my hair soft and curly. I will purchase again. My only issue is that they need to add a washer to the pump to keep it from leaking out. Or change the pump to a continuous thread snap cap.</li>
    <li> Much better smelling than the neem lotion without the aloe gel.  Great for dry skin.</li>
