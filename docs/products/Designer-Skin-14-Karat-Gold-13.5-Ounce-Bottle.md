<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works good smells good</li>
    <li> Super cheap and fast A+</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing! I bought it in the salon for almost three times as much. It gives great color and makes your skin really soft. The shipping was quick and it was the real deal. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> It is very difficult for me to tan and bought this due to reviews. It is okay but other millennium products work better for me. Love black night.  It does smell good!</li>
    <li> I love almost All Designer Skin Lotions, Usually Cant go wrong, Beautiful smell, pineapple like, masks the odor taning can leave. Goes on smoothe and leaves a great color</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way with this lotion, so it lasts you a long time! It is very moisturizing left me skin smooth! The scent I think is yummy it is fruity yet has a coconut after scent. It had pretty good results the bronzers are nice, left me golden. This lotion would be perfect for a beginner! Happy Tanning!</li>
    <li> I typically use Designer Skin&#x27;s Luminary, but I&#x27;m running low. So, I bought a packet of what the associate at the salon suggested. Although Luminary is still one of the top sellers and the best of the best, I did actually like this product.    Thankfully, she let me smell the lotion first before buying a packet. Some people do not like the smell, but I did. It smelled like a light musky/fruity scent (I DID NOT smell the \\&quot;fig\\&quot;, just the exotic fruits scent). Anyways, when I put it on the formula was very running and thin, making it lack 5 stars. What I&#x27;m super happy about it is, after using this lotion, I, even my boyfriend, noticed a very dark tan, a nice and light scent to my skin, and best of all soft/moisturized skin. This is definitely one of my new favorites!    Here&#x27;s the short story: I stick to Luminary (a breakthrough) and Goddess (a tingler/builder). The color I got from 14 karat gold is the best of both! Not too light, but not too dark. Absolutely great and quick results!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and like the results, this time I was not happy when it arrived, unsealed.  Any product going on the body should be sealed for obvious safety and health concerns.</li>
    <li> Product was not expired and worked great.  The smell is a lot better than other tanning lotions.  I would recommend to anyone looking at trying a new tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> I live the smell and it works great</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad, feels good and really made my tan shine! I&#x27;m a model, so this is very useful for me.</li>
    <li> I used to work at a tanning salon, which is how I found out about this lotion. I like to try every single lotion, so I never stick to one in particular. Not the case with this one. I&#x27;ve already bought at least two bottles of this for myself. I love the scent and the color you get from this lotion. My dad wanted to start tanning so I told him to buy this one. After about a month we actually had to tell him to STOP tanning because we was wayyyy to dark. I always recommend this lotion to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion it gives me a sexy dark tan that lasts, I don&#x27;t have to go tanning every day with this lotion because the tan lasts. This lotion gave me a very even tan that looks natural people think i tan in the sun and not in the bed. Also it makes my skin very smooth and silky after i am done tanning and i love the smell before and after i tan. Also it got rid of all my blackheads that i had on my nose and some pimples that i had on my back.&lt;br /&gt;Now not only am i really dark with a tan that lasts but i also have a fresh and silky feeling and looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;IF I WERE YOU I WOULD DEFF GIVE THIS LOTION A TRY. THE NAME SPEAKS FOR IT SELF</li>
    <li> I have been tanning using 14 Karat gold for 3 weeks and have not noticed any color change! Even with the 14 bronzers. I paid 65.00 for this at a salon. I used my moms honey bunny and had instant color! Not the best stuff. But ok if you are not wanting instant color!</li>
    <li> I tan a lot, so i am very picky about my lotions, this one is one of the better smelling ones ive used, and i noticed a difference, just not a huge difference. You can get better lotions for the price however</li>
    <li> I partially didnt really care for the smell. Kind of smells like bananas. And I didn&#x27;t really notice a huge change in color. I think this is more for the feel and health of your skin rather then giving good color/darker results.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to order this lotion at such a great price. Once I got the package I opened it &amp; it was the wrong lotion. They sent Black instead of the 14 Karat. I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really really love this lotion I tanned with it for a couple of weeks and got really dark really fast. It smells super yummy too(&#x3D; Be warned though, I have been told I look alittle orangy a couple times from the bronzers in it so becareful</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was what a friend who used to work in a tanning salon suggested. It has a really tropical fruit-y smell, which I don&#x27;t really care for, but it&#x27;s not as noticeable once you get out of the tanning bed. It&#x27;s a good tanning lotion to start out with, however, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying this particular one again.</li>
    <li> Arrived as described. Pleasant fragrence - smells like apricots. Thank you</li>
    <li> I used this lotion when I began tanning at a salon for the first time. I was a little worried to be spending so much($60) on a lotion I hadn&#x27;t used before! Well I did and OMG!!! I was getting darker by the 4th tanning appointment! I used this lotion with my sister for about 3 months and we still had some left at the end. I am sooooo excited I could find it on Amazon for only $19!!! I had to actually STOP tanning because people were telling me that I was getting TOO dark!!! And I am not a person that tans easily, if Im trying to tan outside in the sun its not going to happen. :) I would def. recommend this lotion to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> 14 karat gold by designer skin is one of my favorite tanning lotions! I switch off between a few to get the best results and this is always one of my &#x27;go-to&#x27; lotions! The smells is AMAZING and the results are great! Just like with any lotion, you apply liberally before tanning and it works it magic. The bronzers give you an immediate result, and I&#x27;m all about instant gratification! It gives you that &#x27;sun kissed&#x27; look right away and the more you use it, the darker you get! Of all of the lotions I&#x27;ve used, this is probably in my top 3 favorites! On a side note- if you purchase this at the tanning salon you&#x27;re going to pay upwards of 80-100 for the bottle, so for sure buy this on amazon!!!</li>
    <li> This was probably the 3rd lotion that I actually tried and stuck with. I used this bottle up until it was bone dry. I love this stuff. I got really tan really fast, but I did hit my plateu with this lotion as well. I&#x27;m thinking about re-ordering again, just because it&#x27;s so cheap and really works. The smell is bearable once you get used to it. At first, it made me queasy and gave me a headache after I tanned. But I&#x27;ve grown to really love the smell, or not mind it so much. It smells like Pandora. But a little better than pandora. Anyway.</li>
    <li> This one is my FAVORITES....because of it&#x27;s fresh tropical fruity smell and all of the many compliments I get after lunch time...lol...Could use more of a bronzer, but....is great once you have achieved the tan you wanted.</li>
    <li> This product does not leave color on your clothes, does not flake on your skin, does not stink, and develops a very realistic natural bronzing tan. I just bought this for my sister as I have used it for almost two years now.</li>
    <li> I used to work at a tanning salon so I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different lotions. This one is definitely my favorite! I love Designer Skin products, but I love this one because for 1 it has instant bronzing, it&#x27;s an age defying formula, and has the color stay technology. When I get out of the tanning bed I&#x27;m super dark! I love it! And the tan stays around for much longer than it does with the cheaper stuff I have! It also gives my skin a wonderful golden brown color, looks very natural compared to some of the other lotions I&#x27;ve tried. Phoenician is a great example...that one gave me a very odd orange tone....it was obvious that I used a tanning bed with that one, not natural at all...although the silicone in it was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2, it smells wonderful! It smells like tropical fruits...a lot of pineapple, I think. And it doesn&#x27;t leave that, \\&quot;I just went tanning\\&quot; smell, which I hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all the different indoor tanning lotions I&#x27;ve tried, although there are some really good ones out there, this is the best bang for your buck, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard a ton of horror stories from customers purchasing tanning lotions online. I mean, unreal, so I was a bit hesitant to make this purchase through amazon. The only reason I did was because there was a statement on here somewhere that either Amazon or the Seller claimed that the bottles are sold factory sealed. I couldn&#x27;t find that statement just now when I went back and looked for it, but it did come factory sealed (wrapped in plastic). And since I already knew what I was buying, the contents inside were 100% 14k Gold lotion. I have used it with no skin irritations too, so I&#x27;m 100% confident this lotion has not been tampered with in any way!</li>
    <li> This is a great tanning lotion with bronzer. The best thing is it smells so tropical like you are right on the beach!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. Works great and you get dark fast without looking orange.</li>
    <li> Would not recommend.  Generally speaking Designer Skin is a good brand.  This just is a poor product. Does not smell good, strange texture.</li>
    <li> I really like the effects of this product.  The aroma of it was ok.  I surely is darkening and I love that about it.  It&#x27;s not that orangely look either.  Beautiful color.</li>
    <li> Pleasent smell. Reminds me of the tropics and coconut/pineapples. Mixes well with other lotions. I use three different lotions when I tan and it smells great with my other choices. Goes on easy and does not leave you feeling greesy after application.</li>
    <li> I have tried TONS of lotions over the years and this is by far my favorite!!!! As I was reading through the reviews I noticed NO ONE mentioned that this is an indoor OUTDOOR lotion!!!! And I have used it at the salon and pool side and it&#x27;s AMAZING!!!!!</li>
    <li> Totally fantastic product. Nice and even dark tan. Very easy on the skin. No dryness or itchiness. Pleasant fragrance. Would purchase Designer Skin products again.</li>
    <li> This lotion was exactly what I was looking for and at an amazing price!! I will never buy another bottle of designer skin lotion from Cal Sun EVER AGAIN! Great item thank you! I would recommend this to all my girlfriends!</li>
    <li> this lotion isn&#x27;t anything to scream about color wise but i never feel greasy or oily after applying it and getting out of the bed, or the sun. the smell is really good, not over powering and it goes on really smooth. i&#x27;ve used better lotions but i&#x27;d maybe buy this one again. good for those who are just starting to get color</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with my lotion! As a man its hard to find lotions with a smooth texture for your arms, this is the one! I received my lotion today and just used it! The results are amazing! This is a unisex lotion and I highly recommend it you won&#x27;t regret it! My skin feels moisturized and fresh, no nasty after smell either. The smell is pleasant and light.</li>
    <li> This was my first real bronzing lotion that I have used. I use it in the tanning bed and I absolutely love it! I bought the bottle at my tanning salon for 65$, on sale, (bad mistake), so get it on amazon. It smells almost like a pear scent perfume, not too strong though, and still smells basically the same after my tanning session. I have found that tanning with this lotion gets me darker when I wait until the next morning to shower so it can set in, It moisturizes my skin great, makes it very soft, and my bottle has lasted a while now. I would buy it again, and recommend it.</li>
    <li> still my favorite lotion! if your looking for  good bronze color i HIGHLY suggest. I worked at a tanning salon and this is the ONLY lotion I&#x27;ve actually seen results with</li>
    <li> Ok. So here&#x27;s the story. I have been tanning like 6 times a week for about 2 months straight. So you could only imagine how dark I am. But I&#x27;ve recently reached my tanning plateau (happens to everyone after a while) I just honestly can&#x27;t get any darker. So I&#x27;ve been playing around with different kinds of tanning lotions. I&#x27;ve used tinglers, bronzers (with HIGH bronzing levels), and any other kind of tanning lotion you can think of. I stumbled upon this one and read really good reviews on it, AND it was REALLY cheap compared to all the other lotions I&#x27;ve been recently buying. After I used it for the first time, I got INSTANT color! Which hasn&#x27;t happened to me in a LONG time since I&#x27;ve been tanning for months straight. And I just got back from tanning with this product for the second time (so yesterday and today) and I got even DARKER than I did yesterday. This stuff is great! I honestly didn&#x27;t think I was able to get any darker but this stuff is ridiculously great!! I sure will be buying this again! So to anyone who has reached their tanning plateau, TRY THIS!! It so works!!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and got here in time!</li>
    <li> Love it! It helps bust the color quicker&#x27;</li>
    <li> I always love the smell of coconut and it gives me thr most beautiful tan :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tanning lotion for over a year now and I&#x27;m obsessed with it. It makes me incredibly dark when I use the tanning bed, but it doesn&#x27;t leave an orange tint on my hands after using it. I somewhat think tanning lotions are a scam but I&#x27;m convinced this lotion actually makes me darker. I&#x27;ve also used it while laying out in the sun and it&#x27;s amazing the color it gave me. It also has a nice beachy smell that I don&#x27;t mind getting on my clothes. If you want a nice gold color I would definitely recommend using this.</li>
    <li> This was my first Designer Skin bronzer lotion that I used, and I love it! However, I am not too fond of the smell. I don&#x27;t tan that easily, but with this product, I got instant color. I used it for a few weeks before switching to DS Liberate. I will say that my mom has a great base tan, and she used this product for a few days and loves it more than I do.  I would NOT use this product if you don&#x27;t already have a base than because it could cause you to turn a little orangy.  Side note: this did not come off on my clothes, which of course, is a huge positive.    Overall, I liked this lotion!</li>
    <li> pretty good tanning lotion. I am fair skinned and did a good job. gave a slight bronze look but not orange or streaky at all.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have always been a fan of the 14K gold. Also, I used to work for a tanning salon in high school, was a little skeptical about buying online. No issues!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try something different from what i have been using(Urban Princess which I Love!) and this tanning lotion smells sooo good and after a couple of hours any scent dissapears which is good.Got really nice tan from it that does not go away for a very long time. Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Sweet deal for this item. I love to use this kind since it has a 14x bronzer. I recommend this to anyone who wants to get tan evenly and look bronze not orange. Highly reccommend.</li>
    <li> This lotion rocks!!! It smells awesome, works great, and makes your skin feel super silky smooth. Better than any lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> Great product for a beginning a base tan! Then bum up to the bronzers, you will look more natural.</li>
    <li> I have tried other products in th past and I shouldn&#x27;t have.  Nothing can compare to 14karat gold lotion.  It is the best on the market.  I won&#x27;t be trying anything else in the future.  Love, love, love it.</li>
    <li> I love love love this lotion! It is my second bottle. Good amount of bronzers, but still lightweight--no heavy silicone to make you feel like you&#x27;re covered in a layer when you get out of the tanning bed. Scent stays true after tam, too. No funky smell when you&#x27;re done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very partial to Designer Skin Tanning Lotions, as I&#x27;ve been using them since I started tanning my sophomore year in high school. This is such a great DS lotion. I first tried this in a packet I bought from my tanning salon last year, used it in a 20min high pressure bed &amp; it got me SOO DARK! So I went on amazon the same day and ordered the full bottle. 14x the bronzers, it really is amazing.</li>
    <li> I was looking for in door tanning lotions and my neice recommended this one for the first choice and Bellezza. Well when I added this to my shopping cart is said that it was in stock, and so I proceeded to the check out. But when I was ready to confurm my order it said that there were none avalible. I think that this needs to be corrected and I think that they should hook me up with a bottle.. GRR.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion , if you want a natural looking tan and fast this is the one to get !!!</li>
    <li> I bought this tanning lotion from Amazon for the price since the tanning salon I worked at sold it for $70.00 and I knew what a great lotion it was from the free samples I was able to use when I worked. $26.00 is definitely a more reasonable price for lotion. I would recommend this lotion to anyone who likes a tropical coconut-y smell. I love tanning with this lotion because the smell reminds me of the beach and I can pretend I am there for the 10 minutes I am in the booth, very relaxing. You can even use this lotion outside and get really good color. This lotion also has you tan in no time (2-4 visits). However, you do need to let it set in your skin (Can&#x27;t shower for a few hours or until the next morning) or else the tan will fade a lot. This is because of how much bronzer is in it, but if you like bronzers, I would definitely recommend this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;One final point, you get a lot of lotion in this bottle. I bought this lotion back in March 2012 and used it throughout the summer outside and many visits to the salon and still have about 1/3 of the bottle left.</li>
    <li> I ordered this 2 years ago.  It worked well, as I remember.  I will probably use it again this year.</li>
    <li> First off i am a veteran tanner. My current salon showed this to me and said it was one of there favorites, i love designer skin products so i was quite excited to try. The smell is horrible (rotten pears). And it makes your skin EXTREMELY itchy i will NEVER USE AGAIN. its been 2 days and my legs are still itching. I gave it 2 stars because it leaves your skin soft..until you start to ravish it lol. I tried black noir today by designer skin much better results!!</li>
    <li> This us my best tanning lotion, for what you are paying you are getting an amazing deal. I will buy this every summer for as long as its availabke,</li>
    <li> I was concerned it wouidnt be the exact product because I have read reviews stating that lotions has been replaced. This was definitely not the case with this lotion. It&#x27;s exactly what it said it was. The packaging is the old design. The company has since changed the color of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, this lotion was shipped very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I like the product. It does have a very strong fruity smell so if that bothers you, I don&#x27;t recommend this lotion.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite indoor tanning lotion by far.  the smell, color, everything.  Designer Skin is, in my opinion, the best brand out there for tanning lotions, always satisfied w/ their products.  &amp; just because 14 K isn&#x27;t the newest or most pricey don&#x27;t overlook it... try it for yourself :)</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product in a tanning salon and paid twice the amount. So to me this product is reasonably priced and smells delicious. Helps with the tanning and maintaining my color!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle of this and hated it. I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell. I think it smells like a monster energy drink at first, but after you get out of the bed it makes your skin smell BURNED. It&#x27;s really nasty!</li>
    <li> Great tanning lotion and cheaper from amazon versus salon</li>
    <li> So far I really like it,it also smells really good, and I received it really fast!</li>
    <li> 14 Karat Gold tanning lotion is by far my favorite.  It smells great and it works amazing! I use to work at a tanning salon and this was my all time favorite.  I still order this and don&#x27;t like other kinds.</li>
    <li> I have had great results with 14 Karat Gold,  Love the product and will purchase more in the future.  Designer Skin is a great skin care product too!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very natural looking, you will see results . I am a repeat buyer of this 14KT, you will not be disappointed&lt;br /&gt;it has a great scent, u will not smell like that burnt. (those of you who fake and bake like me)  you know what I mean !&lt;br /&gt;this is truly a great starter bronzer if you are a 1st timer .....  get it !</li>
    <li> amazing color for olive toned skins. gives a perfect sun kissed look and the smell isn&#x27;t bad at all. I am definitely purchasing this products again.</li>
    <li> This is more than a lotion.  You feel bathed in gold.  It even works on those pesky wrinkles that seem to appear overnight after a certain age, and gives you a glow as if you had been to a spa.  And it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I use to use it a lot in the past the price was great, I am already tan but when I use this lotion it burnt me I was so red and hurting I have never experienced that before. This is suppose to be bronzer, instead it was more of a tingle will never buy again.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best tanning lotions you can buy. It costs much more at the tanning salons. It has a nice scent and really does a nice job. If you want to boost your tan this is a good one to buy.</li>
    <li> Shipping was incredibly fast... The product itself...Was alright...smells good when you apply it.. Smells kinda weird after tanning. This product will probably work really well for someone who is still building a tan. I&#x27;ve only used it about 3-5 times now, but I started switching it with a tingle lotion on some days so we&#x27;ll see how it works :)</li>
    <li> great product.  great seller</li>
    <li> Smell was good, product was good, just need to change it up now and then when tanning.  Felt good and I was happy with the lotion.</li>
    <li> my girlfriend loved it it was $80 in the tanning salon so we were all happy to find it cheaper.</li>
    <li> I bought this same product at my tanning salon and it cost me over 70.00. I&#x27;m so happy because I really liked the product but didn&#x27;t think I could afford it again. Since I just ran out it was very nice to have my new product arrive the day before. Thank you.</li>
    <li> used product before and tanned nicely but for some reason this product did not tan me instead I got burnt. Could have been medications that I was previously on or not...either way try it and see if it works for you or not</li>
    <li> I worked at a tanning salon until it closed. We sold this for 78$ with my discount I paid about 35$. I am very pale with blonde hair, but I don&#x27;t really burn easily. This got me so dark in a short amount of time. Unfortunately I lost it, and I&#x27;m so happy I found it here. I just ordered it and I can&#x27;t wait until it comes in!!</li>
    <li> I like the product.  It has a bubble gum fragerance.  My skin feel very soft when I use Designer Skin 14 Karet Gold.  It&#x27;s a good indoor tanning lotion for a reasonable price. [...]</li>
    <li> one of my favorite indoor tanning lotions it works very well az a bronzer and It smells great and such a much cheaper price on amazon then you will ever find in a tanning salon I would defn recommmend this lotion to a friend</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to many products but this one seems great for my sensitive skin. Helps create the perfect natural glow everyone wants.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a big change since I been using this lotion an tanning. It smells pretty good an is a reasonable price for tanning lotion</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.. It is the only lotion that helped me tan.. I actually got a tan!!!. Which is hard for me because I am so white.. I would recommend this lotion to anyone...</li>
    <li> I order this lotion August of 2014. It is dated 2013 on the bottle. Because this lotion is very quality, I kept it and it still works the same.</li>
    <li> I have had this product before from a tanning salon--- smells, works and looks the same.  great price, fast shipping, plus didn&#x27;t have to deal with salon salespeople and salon mark-ups (SORRY! NOT SORRY!)  will definitely buy again from this seller, would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Love this no orange tent at all... golden brown tan.</li>
    <li> Are there better lotions out there?  Sure.  But in my opinion, this is the best one for the price range.  It also has a pleasant, neutral, light smell that I like better than most.  One of the best tanning lotions I&#x27;ve ever used over the years.  Works equally well in sun or a tanning bed.  The only reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5 is because it WILL leave you feeling greasy and oily until you shower or swim, but most lotions do.  It&#x27;s as though it never fully absorbs into the skin, so you end up washing off some of the bronzers, which it has a few.</li>
    <li> I am a very white lady, and I love this lotion. The smell reminds me of an island- kinda a tropical smell, and I love the bronzing effect. I never quite get &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; but I do get a nice golden glow from this lotion. (It could be my skin of course that makes me not tan heavily) but either way, I only use this lotion for my tanning. Strongly advised to try this one.</li>
    <li> Considering it was expired from 2 years ago, NO IT DID NOT MEET MY STANDARDS! EVERYONE THERE STUFF IS SO CHEIP BECAUSE ITS EXPIRED! WATCH OUT</li>
    <li> no lie dude, someone gave this to me on there way out of the tanning salon cuz they were moving away. so i was like cool this is by disigner skin this will be a sick tanning lotion. i went in the booth and after i read the bottle i pour some into my hand (very liguidy and runny) and started rubbing into my legs and ect..well about half way done i notice this  HORRIBLE!!! scent so i smelled my hands then the bottle and i was so repulsed by this smell i had to take baby wipes and wipe this s*** off my body while trying to hold my breath. dude idk if it is just me or what, but i am by no means picky when it comes to scents with lotions AT ALL. idc how bad it smells as long as i get tan lol i just shower after anyway, but this s*** really turned my stomach dude. idk what is in it to make someone like me nausious but it did. i have never in all my years as a tanner  been turned off by a lotion by the scent,but i just cant deal w this. its nasty and i do not recommend this even to my worst enemy lol. i see in other reviews people mention the nasty scent well they aint kiddin, DS got it wrong with this stuff. idc how tan i get, cant handle the sour rotten fruit/fremented 80 year old apple cider scent lol idk it could just be me or the girl  who gave it too me wanted a laugh lol not cool but i think this is the lotion by seeing other reviews.. do not recommend this deer urine they call lotion to anyone!</li>
    <li> Every time i use this i get compliments alll day on how great i smell lol the bronzers kick butt too :)</li>
    <li> This is an amazing lotion. I love this stuff.  Will definitely keep buying it. This is my third bottle over the last few years.  Good stuff! :-)</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. :) I got a nice tan and quickly!&lt;br /&gt;Prefer this over Designer Skin Black! Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This smells so super amazing! Makes you DARK! A definite MUST HAVE tanning LOTION! Great buy. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love it! I get lots of compliments from people when I wear this. IT SMELLS DELICIOUS! Except after you tan you smell like bacon..lol I like bacon too, So to each his own my friends!</li>
    <li> Just as extra expected.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t really work for me. I asked the owner of a tanning salon why she thought it didn&#x27;t work well with me, and she said she hasn&#x27;t sold it 2+ years!! No wonder it doesn&#x27;t work!! Or I guess it could&#x27;ve been my skin type. Either way I don&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff does exactly what it says. I noticed a deeper tan within a wee; I only go tan 3 times a week so that&#x27;s awesome! At my salon this lotion is $70! Buy it here!</li>
    <li> Get a nice golden base tan with this. Smells ok.</li>
</ol>
