<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I ran out of my usual eye cream and decided to try something else so I purchased this. The consistency is too light for me. It smells great. Unfortunately I used this for 2 weeks and saw no difference. Actually, I did see a difference, my eyes seemed to get worse, which told me that I needed to go back to my normal eye cream. That&#x27;s what I did and my eyes look happy again.</li>
    <li> Feels dry after using</li>
    <li> It feels so relaxing when I put it on. I bought this on a whim based on the high reviews and I am very happy with it. Moisturizes the eyes very well.</li>
    <li> The eye cream goes on smoothly, but too early to tell how effective it is. Don&#x27;t get it in your eyes, can be irritating. The smell is interesting.</li>
    <li> I tried this cream and after 1 month i didnt see any results. My girlfriend told me about REJUVEL 3D (an anti aging cream that uses NASA.. YES! NASA technology). I proceeded to order REJUVEL 3D&#x27;s microgravity cell renewal cream and i started to see results on the second day. This cream took away my discoloration and darkness under my eyes. My skin feels so soft, the texture has improved and people have been noticing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your time with this product. Instead try REJUVEL 3D!!!</li>
    <li> Useless. It has very nice texture but doesn&#x27;t do anything for my eyes!</li>
    <li> I am 29 and this did not work for my dark circles under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Nu-nutrients Cucumber cream cools my skin around the my eyes, and leaves it feeling super smooth. Working over 14+ hour shifts, I have gained dark circles under my eyes which the cucumber cream has been fixing little by little and day by day. I think its one of the best and maybe the only best cream I have ever used to work this good. It doesnt smell bad and it refreshes my skin. :) I love it.</li>
    <li> I usually look for the higher end under eye moisturizers/depuffers, so I decided to try this product out. I read good things about this brand, so I thought why not? I&#x27;ve been using this for a month. I apply a very, very small amount morning and night (you don&#x27;t need much). This has a light, fresh cucumber fragrance. I am so happy I found this product! My skin felt instantly soothed when I used it the first time.One of the best eye creams I have bought in a long while!</li>
    <li> I love cucumber smelling products that are clean and fresh. I have pretty sensitive skin so I&#x27;m very careful about what I use. This soothes my skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. The dark circles under my eyes are not as noticeable and the skin feels more hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it wasn&#x27;t quite so expensive. But by using it just around my eyes, it does last longer. I&#x27;m making it a part of my skin care routine, I&#x27;m not sure that I would notice if my fine lines around my eyes diminish with use, because I don&#x27;t notice them to begin with. I just want my skin to feel smooth and clean. This product works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something that would help with the looks of the area under my eyes, and I found it. This products is amazing and does the job. I love how I feel afterwards, too! Worth the money for sure!</li>
    <li> I love love love this product. I&#x27;m an avid user of eye creams because as a full time employee, a full time mom, wife, and all my other hats... I&#x27;m exhausted. All the time ! And sometimes I am so stressed out that I don&#x27;t sleep very well .. and wake up looking it. Now that I&#x27;m getting a bit older, I&#x27;ve noticed that my eyes get puffy easily when I don&#x27;t sleep well and that I&#x27;m starting to get lines. This cucumber eye cream is so soothing and feels so good when I put it on. It really does reduce the swelling so it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve been up crying all night long or something (which doesn&#x27;t happen, but that&#x27;s what it looks like !).</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a product that makes you look younger and feel better,  then this product is for you. Reduce expression lines and wrinkles with this product.  I can&#x27;t help but to use it nightly if you can only benefit from it. The cucumber formula also feels soothing and extremely refreshing on your skin.</li>
    <li> Aaaahhhh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice....I like to use the NuNutrients eye cream at night as part of my usual night-time regimen.  After washing my face, and massaging the serum into my face, I take a bit of the eye cream on my baby finger and then lightly dab it under my eye.  At my age, under eye bags are inevitable, probably due to daily stress and lack of enough sleep.  Realistically, the eye cream hasn&#x27;t taken away the bags under my eyes but it&#x27;s certainly left them less noticeable after two weeks&#x27; use.  Not only that, once I apply the cream under my eyes, the skin becomes more soft, less strained.  I really like that.  Overall, it&#x27;s definitely a product I recommend to anyone with under eye fatigue - as you can tell, I much prefer to refer to them as &amp;#34;eye fatigue&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;under eye bags&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Love this cucumber eye cream.  It is very refreshing and makes the skin firmer and feeling awesome!  I highly recommend this cream to any women that need a nice feeling, non-greasy cream at night or even during the day.  It is the best facial cream I have used in several years.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use it every day and it feels so nice under my eyes. I work a lot and get bags under my eyes, and this cream definitely helps.</li>
    <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have bags under my eyes yet. Due to long hours at school and work I do so I was looking for a product to help out with that. There are so many different products out there that I went with reviews and price. Worst case scenario it didn&#x27;t work. Luckily it has been improving so I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been working a lot lately and not sleeping as much. It is super obvious by the puffiness around my eyes that I am not &#x27;rested&#x27;, and this is unattractive, and makes my employer nervous. I think my eyes make me look more tired than I am, so I thought I would get something to help this. I bought this and it did just that. It love it. I would recommend it, and would say it is super effective for it price.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It smells and feels amazing. I noticed my eyes looked alittle brighter after my 2nd use. I use it only once a day, and that was enough to see it actually works.</li>
    <li> I love using products made with natural ingredients on my skin so NuNutrients Cucumber eye is one of my most proud product purchases. I have a fair complexion and dark circles under my eye are very prominent. After 2 weeks of using the eye cream, i notice a significant difference in the circles under my eyes because they no longer were there! Awesome product that smells great.</li>
    <li> Who knew that Cucumbers would be so good for eye cream. Many woman worry about eye circles and bags under the eyes. I bought this for my sister who goes through tons of skin care products all the time. She has told me that it&#x27;s made of very good quality and she is pretty happy with it. I see the difference, and her skin looks much healthier and hydrated. Pretty good product at a good price for the market.</li>
    <li> i was so in love with this product. ias most women who are in thier mid 40&#x27;s, we are concerned with our skin. i had dark circles from lack of sleep and long work hours i started to notice that wrinkles were also forming under the crevices of my eyes. my face was dry and i used many skin products before, i decided to use try this product . after i recieved it in mail, i used it and after a week i started to notice the skin on my face was lighter, and glowing. the puffiness i suffered seem to diminish and i felt young again because you could see my eyes again. it created a soft layer on my face and it was so refreshing to use. i recommend this product highly for women who are looking for a good healthy product for thier skin and problem areas most of us suffer from</li>
    <li> People always tell me that I look younger than I am, but people always tell me that I always look tired. Just I tried the Omegaboost for my hair loss issues, I tried NuNutrients to make myself actually look younger than I am. It has worked very well. I know that because I am very tired from all of the work that I have done in the last month-but people say that I look good. Moreover, the people that talked about the circles under my eyes have noticed they were gone (they said it nicely of course). With that in mind, I would recommend this to people that actually could use it because it does work as a way to get rid of what may be a subtle aesthetic look (the circles under my eyes) and it was to me until multiple people pointed it out.</li>
    <li> I work long hours as a nurse and it was starting to show. Three months ago, my coworker recommended NuNutrients to me. I have seen a tremendous change under my eyes. i finally look my age! If you work overnight, I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m usually pretty careful in checking reviews to spot any potential scam.  The companies hired for fake reviews are getting smarter, so now the fake reviews are harder to spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I bought the cream and while it smells good, the results are pretty much non existant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I checked the reviews in more detail and I was convinced they are fake.  For instance, the last two 5-star reviews as of today are from Nina Chung and Alexis Danclar.  Strangely enough, both users have ONLY rated the EXACT same products with 5-stars over a couple days.  What are the odds of this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from yet another company selling an average product and boosting its sales through fake reviews.  When will Amazon start clamping down on this?</li>
    <li> Great product! I have had a problem with puffy under eyes and dark circles under my eyes for years. This issue seems to run in my family on both sides. I have tried so many products in the past which claim to fix this problem but none of them have worked. After using this product for just one week I have noticed a huge difference. My eyes look rested and refreshed. The women at my gym give my so many compliments, saying how young I have been looking lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy I decided to order this product. It has done exactly what it said it would do. The price is very affordable and I received it really fast. I recommend this product if you have issues with your under eye area.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with these rashes below my eyes, I believe inflammation, but I was never sure. I have tried other things only to have it worsen. However this actually helped! I don&#x27;t have the rashes anymore and my skin feels incredible.</li>
    <li> Two months ago I encouraged my mom to get out of the house and go on a date (its been 10yrs) and she refused. My wife and I kept at her constantly but she refused because she felt old because of her wrinkles and circles under her eyes. So we began our search for a really natural product that has worked for others. My wife found NuNutrients Cucumber Eye Cream and decided to buy it. The result? Every Sunday my wife and mother spend hours talking about her many options and how she cant walk a few meters without getting compliments - I think ill have to take that cream away - LOL! Thanks NuNutrients, my mom is enjoying life again and its all because of you!</li>
    <li> This cream is a life saver. let me tell you, I work very late at night and get up very early in the morning. I have always had dark circles under my eyes and have to layer on the make-up to keep it from being noticeable. I look younger and healthier without so much make-up but I do what I can. I love the cucumber smell of this cream, it is so refreshing to me. It really does help diminish the dark circles under my eyes and I am very happy to say that I no longer have to wear so much cover-up.</li>
    <li> What an amazing eye cream. This really gets rid of eye damage, from dark rings to other things. Not only that, but the cream smells very nice and feels extremely natural on the eyes. Plus, the product has a great value for the quantity and comes in a conveniently sized and shaped container.</li>
    <li> Really wonderful. I have been using NuNutrients- Cucumber Eye Cream for 3 weeks now and I can feel the difference in my skin and around my eye area. My dark circles are gone, the wrinkles and freckles have disappeared and I feel fantastic. The smell is really refreshing and and it does work wonders for you. Its time you start feeling great with great skin and feel fresh all day long. I highly recommend NuNutrients- Cucumber Eye Cream for any one having dark circles, wrinkles or any skin problem. Great buy! The price is very very reasonable too compared with the effectiveness of the product.</li>
    <li> Great skin product. I wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first, but after trying it I am now a huge fan. It is extremely soothing on the face and makes my skin soft while at the same time tightening my skin and reducing the wrinkles. I am very satisfied with this product. No complaints to report.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the aging process turn you into the Crypt Keeper. Smooth out your facial skin with this product so you don&#x27;t have to look like tomorrow today. Arrives quickly and has great results. Get this now.</li>
    <li> I had dark circles under my eyes from the college days of pulling all-night study sessions and working full time. I used to hide them with concealer, but good concealer is expensive. My friend used NuNutrients Cucumber Eye Cream on her dark circles, and she looks great! I decided to give it a go. After using this product the dark circles under my eyes have almost completely disappeared. Now I&#x27;m saving money on concealer and feeling better about my overall appearance.</li>
    <li> I am a software professional and sits before computer for most of the time. As a result of this, there are dark circles around my eyes. My eyes also became weak. Then I started using this cream and it shown great improvement in eliminating dark circles. With regular use, I am able to find smooth skin and cool feel. The puffiness around my eyes also decreased and yes, it is an amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for NuNutrients for this wonderful Cucumber Eye Cream!</li>
    <li> Nunutrients Cucumber cream really soothed my skin around my eyes, and left them smooth,and moisturized with a really great scent. Also, reduced my dark circles, and even helped out by smoothing some eye wrinkle. ( A much needed bonus)!!  It also helped reduced some inflammation around my eyes, as it made my eyes more firmer feeling. I can not believe how great this made my eyes feel. This eye cream really works great for a spa day!! I recommend this product for anyone who wants or need a really great eye cream.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything. It&#x27;s just liquified cucumber so you&#x27;d be better off just putting fresh cucumbers slices on your eyes.</li>
    <li> NuNutrients Cucumber Eye Cream is a wonderful part of my nighttime routine. I love the smell of the cucumber. It is such a soothing scent. Add that to the fact that the creme is velvety smooth and leaves my skin feeling and looking rejuvenated, and you have a product that is worth buying again and again. Anyone looking to reduce dark under eye circles and puffiness, should buy this product. It is a safe and effective cream that really gives you a bang for your buck! All my friends use this and I suggest that you do to!</li>
    <li> OMGosh. It&#x27;s just awesome. I love the cucumber smell and it has an immediate brightening effect my tired eyes (I&#x27;m a masters student so I don&#x27;t sleep).</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife who has gained dark circles under her eyes for working overtime. The cream is very soothing and has completely removed the black circles after a few days of application. Highly recommend others to try.</li>
    <li> NuNutrients Cucumber Eye Cream is a great way to improve skin condition around the eyes.  After continuous application, it reduces eye wrinkles.  It&#x27;s also a good way to reduce dark spots under the eyes.  Priced just under $40, it&#x27;s a bargain.</li>
    <li> Nunutrients Cucumber cream leaves my skin smooth. I love nunutrients cucumber because it cools skin around my eyes. It also soothes my skin and has an amazing moisturizing effect on my skin. It has helped reduced the circles under my eyes. The puffiness is gone because it help reduce inflammation and calms my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyes looks youthful again because nunutrients cucumber has an anti-aging effect. I no longer have dark circles under my eyes. I feel and look younger. I recommend nunutrients to anyone who is looking for a reliable yet inexpensive eye cream.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she&#x27;s really happy with the purchase. She said that it&#x27;s really good and it really has the smell like natural cucumber. It works extremely well on her and has been constantly asking me to buy more for her. I highly recommend this on anyone who wants eye cream at a good price with an outstanding quality.</li>
    <li> From working nights and lack of sleep, I have developed dark circles, and smoking brought wrinkles out. I like the look of older age but not at the age of 23!! I tried everything and nothing helped. I finally got recommended this by my girlfriend who I thought was just wasting my money. Come to find out, it is how she stays beautiful with firm tight skin. I figured I would give it a try and WOW. Only a week later I have amazing results and I love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife, and then began trying it myself. First off, she is 52 year old asian lady. I am 50 year old caucasian. We have a wild kid who is hard to keep up with, and over the years we&#x27;ve developed circles around our eyes, puffiness, just not youthful. As a surprise, I got some NuNutrients Cucumber Eye Cream for my wife to try. She usually uses eye creams from Target, different brands, but this one she reported to me as being different and refreshing. I decided to try it too. We both like the cool feeling. I like the information that it is made up of natural ingredients in addition to cucumbers, which by the way are one of my favorite vegetables. We feel healthier as a result of using Nutrients Cucumber Eye Cream.</li>
    <li> Very good cream. I really like it. particularly helpful in dealing with bags under his eyes. Almost gone and my gray circles under the eyes. In the morning, I look rested even if you do not sleep enough last night.</li>
    <li> Every time I use this product, my skin feels rejuvenated and refreshed. The smell is amazing- I feel like I am at the spa each time I use it. The best part about it is that cucumbers have anti-inflammatory properties-- I put it around my puffy eyes in the morning and the puff is gone by the time I get out the door. I have actually used this on my entire face-- it gives it an extra fresh lift.</li>
    <li> I love NuNutrients - Cucumber Eye Cream, it has&lt;br /&gt;been God sent. For all of my adult life I have sufferred for dark circles under my eyes. I have used some of the industries most expensive and popular products over the years and Nu-Nutrients is on par with the best of them and at a fraction of the cost. Now while I appreciate a good bargain as well as the next fashionista, I spend my money wisely on things that are essential and that work. This Product Works!</li>
    <li> I put this on after I wash my face and some night it burns underneath my eyes.  Something not so natural must be in it..</li>
    <li> It has a pleasant smell but it really does not help with my dark circles.  Unsure really if it is helping with fine wrinkles also.  Will continue to use till it is gone.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I used to have to pile concealer under my eyes to hide the dark circles I don&#x27;t have to anymore because this product now I look even younger than ever. This also tightened my skin too. It smells good &amp; feels good on your skin leaving your skin feeling invigorated and moisturized. Must have facial cream.</li>
    <li> I think I only had to use it for two to two and a half weeks before seeing genuine results. Beforehand I was just surrendering to the ravages of time and my eyes were feeling baggy and wrinkly and it was doing a real number on my confidence. But now I feel better and I can take on aging gracefully thanks to NuNutrients!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me:(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this on behalf of my girlfriend... who looks AMAZING thanks to NuNutrients Cucumber Eye Cream. She&#x27;s been raving about it for the past couple weeks. When baby&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy! And this cream makes her happy. She works a lot of hours, and has bouts of insomnia. She&#x27;d been self-conscious about the dark circles under her eyes... to the point it was affecting her self-esteem and even her interest in going out. It didn&#x27;t take long for the cucumber cream to work. She looks great, feels great. And we&#x27;re going out tonight! Thanks NuNutrients! I owe ya!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a week. So far, I can&#x27;t tell a difference with dark circles, but it&#x27;s ability to get rid of puffiness is nothing short of amazing! I use it on my entire face, and the skin looks much smoother.</li>
    <li> As I have become older, I never thought in a million years  that I would suffer from bags or dark circles around my eyes..... But I do! I&#x27;m not one to wear a lot of make-up, let alone creams until I came across this product. What caught my attention was it being cucumbers and how refreshing it will feel. Once I put on the cream for first time, instant cooling feel. My circles around eyes became less puffy and skin  left feeling soft. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!! I&#x27;m on my 6th bottle of it!! It&#x27;s light and effective. ☺️</li>
    <li> I use it before I go to sleep and I’ve found that if the cream has time to dry on your face then it works best. During the day works too but not as good.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Feels very refreshing on my face.</li>
    <li> Am 45, have had dark circles under my eyes since bad allergic reaction in 2nd grade.  And recently, under-eye puffiness has really set in.  I am so happy I read through all the reviews.  Have only been using for a few days, but definately see a dramatic difference!  As someone else stated, have tried many other products, but this is the first to apparently really be affective...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I use this when I start looking tired under my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried other creams before, which have worked, but this has to be the quickest one to work for me that i have used to date. I have sensitive skin and eyes and this one doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
    <li> Like the produvpct and the herby cucumber smell. Seems to help with my chronic eye puffiness. Gives sensation of relief ....to early to comitt to any other claims....not a miracle product so far</li>
    <li> Awesome Eye Cream!  I look younger already!  The cucumber has a nice smell and feels cool to the skin.  This NuNutrients Cucumber Eye cream took the puffiness away from under my eyes.  I use it every night before bedtime.  It is a part of my bedtime ritual.</li>
    <li> If your looking for a great product to remove dark circles from under your eyes, this is it. This product not only eliminated the dark circles, but it also helped rid the swelled look of my face sometimes.</li>
    <li> I just turned 30 years old, and in addition to dark stress circles under my eyes, I was beginning to notice the very beginnings of fine lines in the corners of my eyes. I was freaking out a little, since I am not ready for that yet! Thankfully, a co-worker recommended this to me. It truly is soothing, and my face just feels good after using it. Best of all, the lines and circles have vanished! I feel much more secure about my face now, and I no longer feel the need to obsessively apply concealer throughout the day!</li>
    <li> I would recommend giving this eye cream a try. I have always heard that cucumbers on the eyes help to relieve puffiness and so when I saw that there was a cucumber eye cream, I figured that it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try. I have only been using it for two weeks now but so far so good. I can already see small changes in the way that my eyes look less tired than they did before and the skin around my eyes is a bit firmer.</li>
    <li> Wow! My dark circles are gone and I look 10 years younger. I already have great skin going for me but at 57 the dark circles were bothering me. Now I feel like I&#x27;m in my forties and I&#x27;m ready to paint the town. A must have for you women who want younger looking eyes!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m only 21 and i already have such terrible dark circles under my eyes. I can only really get them to go away if i go get a facial but i just don&#x27;t have the fund for that right now. After i found this eye cream though, i started to notice my dark circles just weren&#x27;t a problem anymore, and it also reduces  a lot of stress on the eyes because of the cucumber in it. i feel rejuvenated and i don&#x27;t have to spend an extra 20 minutes in the morning packing on concealer before i go to work!</li>
    <li> It is a rip off . False reviews or maybe did not work for me . It&#x27;s such a waste of money . It is just like any other moisturizer with less moisturizing ability . I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to this product for anyone with any expectation .</li>
    <li> So I was a little skeptical about buying this because there were SO many five star reviews. Didn&#x27;t think it could be true and guess what, it wasn&#x27;t. Though this cream is nice, it smells nice and feels nice, I have had zero reduction on the circles on my eyes. I bought No7 eye cream a few days ago and I am already noticing a difference now. I think most of these reviews are fake, which I&#x27;ve seen others say as well.</li>
    <li> This is the only eye cream my wife will use.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a bit of a stress reliever.  I&#x27;m not quite the age for wrinkles, but I do get dark circles from lack of sleep, stress, etc.  I bought this half expecting another placebo product with no real effects, but I was so wrong.  This product not only made my dark circles disappear, but using it is such a relaxing experience.  5/5 a must have for stress relief.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews of other users and I was pleased to learn that the product is very good and is especially effective for the eye as indeed is specified on the package, I think that would purchase the product safely</li>
    <li> Feels cool and fresh on eyes.  Would recommend</li>
    <li> Loved this product! Saw results within a few weeks. Great moisturizer and smells good!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay moisturized . The first jar felt better than the 2nd jar . Maybe a different manufacturer. Too expensive and doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream! My eyes get super puffy and my dark circles are very noticeable when I don&#x27;t get enough rest. I&#x27;m a night owl with insomnia, so I never get enough sleep. But this product makes it look like i&#x27;ve had a full nights rest! No joke, my dark circles diminish and my face looks brighter and fresher than ever :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus! A little goes a long way... I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream now for about 2 months and I still have a lot left. Another great thing about this product is that it feels so nice on my skin. It really is soothing like the description says. Right after putting it on, I feel a cooling sensation, so I know it&#x27;s working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me and only get 3-6 hours of sleep a night, do yourself a favor and get this eye cream. It makes you feel great and no one wants to look like a raccoon!</li>
    <li> I have always had under eye darkness. I have tried a lot of products to help get rid of them too. I really am happy with this product and recommend it! Its definitely improved my under eye circles so much. I even have to wear less makeup and thats a great aspect of using this cream. It also feels really wonderful when you apply it which is also another thing I love about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other products in the past and they might work after using them for a very long time but after using this cream I saw that it helped and improved my circles almost immediately! I love the feel of the cream as well. Some other products out there smell way too chemical but this has a pleasant scent. I love the natural ingredients found in it and I truly believe thats what sets this apart from any other cream.</li>
    <li> Cucumbers have long been used to help puffy eyes – I remember putting cucumber slices on my eyes after reading this tip in a beauty magazine. The dark circles and puffiness under my eyes have been a longtime pet peeve of mine. If it were not for that, I would look a heck of a lot younger than I do; although people still think I am younger than my age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HATE the dark circles and what I call bags under my eyes – I don’t like looking like a raccoon, and an aging one at that. I have tried so many products - from inexpensive Oil of Olay to really expensive La Prairie - with a lot in between. None of these have helped much and I resort to applying a lot of erase/concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this a try after a friend of mine recommended it. I don’t care for oily or overly perfumed products, but love this because it is light and has a perfect consistency. After using this cream everyday for just a week, I definitely noticed an improvement in the puffiness and I looked less like a raccoon. I am really happy that I tried this product and have confidence that the appearance of the skin under my eyes will improve even more with extended use. I can finally be proud of my appearance and perhaps people will stop telling me I look like I haven’t slept. This has gotten rather tiresome (no pun intended) after hearing it hundreds of times over the last 15 years – especially from my own mom!</li>
    <li> As a mother of two kids I don&#x27;t get as much sleep as I would like too, so I constantly have dark circles under my eyes that even good concealer won&#x27;t cover. I have been using the cucumber eye cream for about a month now and WOW what a difference! the dark circles have definitely lightened up and my eyes look brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream it self is very light and it smells cucumber-y, you don&#x27;t need a lot of it just a small dab under both eyes. I use it every morning and night and I used it under my make up.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I work a lot and sometimes I barely get sleep. Over the years, I started to develop bags under my eyes  and began looking a lot older than my actual age. A friend of mine recommended that I use this product to remove my bags and to get me back to looking like my age or younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product and I absolutely love everything about it. I recommend it to everyone I know that has been having the same issues with dark circles and bags under their eyes. I love how it smells unlike some other creams that have a not so pleasant smell. It is very rich and creamy and leaves skin feeling soft like a baby. I have gotten rid of the bags under my eyes but due to the fact that I work so much, I keep using it so that those dark circles and bags don&#x27;t come back. Get this product. It is awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 5 weeks now, and I actually do think it has helped a little to lighten the circles under my eyes, and the dark blue color at the inner corners of my eyes. Hasn&#x27;t taken it away as much as I had hoped, but will continue using to see if I get more results.</li>
    <li> Very small bottle for the price...but I thought hey if it works awesome...but it doesn&#x27;t after 3 weeks of using and the bottle is about gone...NOTHING I still have bags under my eyes...</li>
    <li> useless i dont undrestand who wrote all those positive reviews this is useless</li>
    <li> This product does its major in more than just the eyes. Once I applied this cream around the eyes, it not only reduced the visible effects of my stressful life, but it also worked to reduce the stress itself. I was able to go through my day without having to worry about how my eyes would look and the cucumber and natural leaf extract just gave me a soothing feeling that I loved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great on reducing the wrinkles and bags around the eyes, and on top of that, it&#x27;s worked just as well as any product I&#x27;ve bought that was meant to increase my wellness. The immediacy of its cooling effects is nice, but what&#x27;s nicer is that the effect has such durability. Also a big plus is that it is made of all-natural ingredients - something many other companies cannot boast.</li>
    <li> So I have a history of having dark circles around my eyes because I&#x27;ve been wearing glasses ever since I&#x27;ve been 5 years old, and because of that I don&#x27;t even want to get contacts anymore, I want to still wear glasses because of the dark circles. I was looking around for a cream that removes dark circles and I came across this and I am so happy I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed the dark circles around my eyes have started to lighten up and my skin is looking so much better! The more consistent I am with putting on the cream the lighter, and lighter my eyes are becoming. its even making my skin brighter all together. This was such a smart purchase on my end. It really docent matter how much it is...you cannot put a price on how good it will make you feel! Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had huge bags under my eyes since my son was born three years ago. I tried a half dozen different products, but none made any noticeable difference. This eye cream works. I use it in the mornings and evenings. Somewhere between the 1st and 2nd weeks I started getting compliments on my skin. There is a significant reduction in the shadowy-ness under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great and has an immediate cooling effect when applied. It doesn&#x27;t feel oily or sticky.  I look less like a tired mommy and more like a well-rested hot momma! At last--a skin care product that actually gives you results!!! Wahoo!</li>
    <li> This product did the opposite of what is supposed to. I now have more red circles below my eyes and there is an irritation burn. I&#x27;m only hopeful that this will go away in a few days but I&#x27;m never using this product again</li>
    <li> Even at the ripe old age of 39 I wake up with these unfortunate looking bags under my eyes. I know, I know, I should get more sleep. But since I’m in the midst of working, and raising two kids, getting the recommended 8+ hours is, needless to say, difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve of course considered surgery, but … when I researched eye creams on Amazon, I noted the great reviews, and that was enough for me.  Oh, and yeah, the price! It hasn’t created any miracles, but I can definitely notice a difference, especially with the puffiness, and the fine lines around my eyes. Totally recommend.</li>
    <li> For as long as I could remember, my eyes have always had dark circles. Even when I rest well. I&#x27;m fair-skinned, so it always bothered me. I use make-up but it never lasts through the day. I decided to look up other options and tried this. Very happy! It&#x27;s nice to finally not look so tired, even when I&#x27;m not!</li>
    <li> I I have been using this product for almost a month. I was waiting to write a review because I wanted to see results, so far I have not seen any negative or positive results. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle cream, but I was a little disappointed that there is no results at all. I can say that a positive thing about this cream is that a did not cause any irritation around my eyes like other creams. I will continue using it, and if I get any results later on I will post it, after all it hasn&#x27;t even been a  month</li>
    <li> When applied, this product feels incredibly smooth, comforting, and rejuvenating under your eyes</li>
    <li> The cream itself was great but I wasn&#x27;t really a fan of the cucumber smell (i know, i am buying a cucumber cream here), my friend tried it and loved it so i gave the rest of my jar to her. So i guess its a good cream but just not for me. I took away another star because amazon sent it to me a day later than I was supposed to get it. UGH!</li>
    <li> I purchased this on a whim because I saw all the positive reviews...then I noticed that very few of the reviews are actually verified Amazon purchases. I think the company just wrote a bunch of fake 5 star reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for a week and have come to realize it doesn&#x27;t do anything at all. It is just a moisturizing eye cream. I usually use Kiehl&#x27;s eye creams to eliminate my dark circles and puffiness. Since I started using this, I have had numerous friends come up to me and ask &amp;#34;what&#x27;s wrong?&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;are you okay? your eyes are puffy.&amp;#34; People keep asking if I haven&#x27;t been sleeping well. I have never had anyone ask me this before. Needless to say, I will be going back to my old Kiehl&#x27;s eye cream. Lesson learned: if you see a new product on Amazon with numerous 5 star reviews, always check to see if the reviews are actually from verified Amazon purchases.</li>
    <li> I am very old and my skin has started to sag around my eyes a lot. I guess my daughter bought this online from Amazon and gave it to me as a gift for my birthday as part of my present. I don’t know if it can subtract 20 years but I have been applying it to my face every night and I think it has subtracted 3 or 4 good years. Maybe if I keep using it, I will feel like a baby! Lol. I am happy with results and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Wow - this actually DOES remove those pesky dark under eye circles! I was super impressed with this product and use it daily. It feels great when you apply it too - very refreshing. I didn&#x27;t expect this product to actually do what it claimed, but it does. This is now a staple in my cleansing routine.</li>
    <li> Recently took a new job that requires long hours. In theory I should be getting the same amount of sleep as anyone else but the post office and grocery stores do not adhere to the same schedule as I do. So I usually end up getting 6 hours of sleep on a good day. Lately I’ve developed dark circles around my eyes and I walk around all drowsy. It’s not a good look frankly and I started to use cucumber eye cream and it’s worked a bit on my appearance. I think if I get in a routine it will get better so I’m here to buy more and hopefully I’ll get a better schedule, but for now I’ll use NuNutrients.</li>
    <li> Their skin must feel so good afterwards. This product gives me a little taste of that though, and I know because I’ve had facemasks but they take so dang long to do. I think I feel about 80 percent as good, honestly. And that’s really good for literally just putting it on and rubbing in my face. All of maybe three to four minutes. Amazing. I’ll take it. Thanks NuNutrients.</li>
    <li> can&#x60;t see any change at all. It does feel good when applied, cool.</li>
    <li> Tried this product to replace Arbonne eye cream. It smells nice, not chemical and has a thick consistency. Because I live in a high elevation, dry climate, i use it both at night for &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; and in the morning for &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t see a life changing difference, there is a positive difference. I will continue to use this product for it&#x27;s hydrating properties.</li>
    <li> I work from 4am until 8pm in a kitchen does it do horrible things to my face and my eyes get it the worst since I barely get enough sleep for the demands of a family and a full time job. After about 3 years on the job I look 5 years older and I was desperate to do something about my meal ticket ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using a few brand that you can find at your local pharmacy they offered minimum help on my dark bags. I was recommended this product so I gave it a try. After about week of use I noticed my eyes were lighter and less puffy. In two weeks my bags were gone and my eyes look younger.</li>
    <li> Just took a graveyard shift and it’s been hell on my eyes. After work I crash out at maybe 9 am and a lot of the time I have to get up earlier to make sure I make it to certain stores or chores I need to do before 5pm or 6pm. Then I have to eat and get ready for my next shift. In theory it would be easy but since the entire world doesn’t work that way my eyes are used to inconsistent sleep. I have dark circles a lot but after using this cream my eye circles have faded a bit. It’s working out and maybe I can switch to a more regular time to work but until then I have this product.</li>
    <li> Just started using this....it&#x27;s the s***!!! I love it!! Already notice a difference!!!!! Its da bomb!!!!</li>
    <li> This delightful cream has been permanently added to my skin care regimen. All the NuNutrient products I have tried have been simply marvelous and this one is no exception. Used in conjunction with the NuNutrient Vitamin C serum, I have almost completely eradicated the dark, baggy circles under my eyes. This cream feels great on my skin and the cucumber scent is quite pleasant, and not overwhelmingly strong.. This product, plus enough sleep, is very good for the general health of your visage. If you like cucumbers, or even if you don&#x27;t and just want your face to perk up a bit, check out this eye cream. It&#x27;s worth your time. I know it was worth mine! I used to have really bad under eye blemishes from years of just not treating myself right. Those days are over, and this cream is helping me get back to where I was when I was young.</li>
    <li> I am a new mom and like most new moms, I rarely sleep. A friend bought this for me and I didn&#x27;t believe it would work. I was very pleased and surprised when it did. I now look like I have had a full night&#x27;s rest!</li>
    <li> The Cucumber Eye Cream works wonders! I actually prefer this over using the old-fashioned way of just using cucumbers! I use it either day or night, or as a pick me up, or when I feel like having a &amp;#34;mini-spa&amp;#34; day. Easy application - just dab underneath the eyes. It has a slight cooling effect, and it slowly lightens and improves the appearance of dark spots under the eyes. Also is good for slowly improving the appearance of crow&#x27;s feet. It really is amazing!</li>
    <li> I am nocturnal! I have two toddlers and a very &amp;#34;affectionate&amp;#34; husband, so I don&#x27;t sleep! I was so tired of throwing away my money on makeup trying to cover my dark circles, so I wanted to find something to get rid of them. I was using other creams I won&#x27;t use names but they were making me break out, I have very sensitive skin.  My brother got this for me as a gift because he uses a hair restoration treatment from Nu Nutrients and he loves it so he got me this. I have been using it every morning for almost a month and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or rashes, and my dark circles have been replaced with smooth supple skin that matches my complexion. I have started using it on my entire face now so that the rest of my face looks as beautiful as the skin under my eyes! It works fast and gave me great results. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> As a busy stay at home mom and housewife I am constantly on the go and don&#x27;t always get the amount of sleep I should be. While my body cathes up, my eyes tell a different story. On those days especially is when I go to the cucumber eye cream. It has such a cooling and soothing feeling without leaving my face feeling greasy like some other creams did.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this eye cream! It took a couple of weeks to see results, but those results are phenomenal! I&#x27;ve always had big dark bags under my eyes and I&#x27;ve started to develop crow&#x27;s feet in the past couple of years. After just a couple of weeks, my eyes look years younger and I don&#x27;t even have to wear makeup when I go out anymore. Plus it has a very natural cucumber scent that I love! I definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a good eye cream!</li>
    <li> I have a problem with dark circles under my eyes and it is really pronounced in photos. Being a guy, I wasn&#x27;t generally too concerned with them  until I started getting my photo taken for heads shots and at performances (I play the guitar). I didn&#x27;t like how I was looking in photographs so I took the advice of a friend and tried NuNuntrients Cucumber Eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of using this, sleeping a little more and keeping an eye on my hydration those puffy bags are all but gone. I highly recommend this product and would use it again.</li>
    <li> Another great product from NuNutrients. I love this cream, I use it regular. It definitely helps firm and tighten my eyes and remove the dull dark marks, so I won&#x27;t look like an overworked zombie! lol. It&#x27;s even great just as a moisturizer under make-up. My skin does feel flawless and I am very satisfied with the results i&#x27;m getting :) A+ Product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I am so happy I bought it. With long work hours and the daily stresses it showed under my eyes. The cream felt great, and smelled nice too. It works good for my tired eyes, nice and cooling. I plan on buying it again</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful eye cream!  I have always had some trouble sleeping, and as such I wake up with dark circles and bags under my eyes frequently.  I have used a lot of skin creams before like Cetaphil, Olay etc.  but none have worked as well as this cucumber eye cream from NuNutrients.  I apply it once or twice a day, always before I go to sleep and when I wake up I see my skin looking refreshed and smooth.  I really do look 10 years younger since using this cream, and others have told me so!  It&#x27;s a fantastic product, I encourage everyone to try it out.</li>
    <li> This product not only has a good perfume good but it Feels good. I Have really bad dark circles. It is really bad and Makeup has not really helped. I have been using this product about 5 days and I am noticing a difference. I fully intend to use this daily for the next few weeks and see how it turns out at the end of the month But I have high hopes for this product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about the product itself but the reviews her seem all fake. Most reviewers have reviewed other products but most of them are the same products, the odds of which are super rare !</li>
    <li> my wife likes it and like the result. very effective.</li>
    <li> The air where I live is polluted and it hurts my eyes, makes them puffy. I keep it down with NuNutrients and the inflammation goes down pretty well.</li>
    <li> I started a new job and I haven’t gotten much sleep because I am trying to impress them. My appearance has started to drop a little bit though, and that might be as important if not more important than putting in long hours. So I started to use this cucumber cream and my eyes used to have these dark, dark bags under them. Now they are almost back to what they were before I started this job. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Really happy with results. I use it twice a day and it is great for my eyes I have no problems or inflammation.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a few weeks. Can&#x27;t see results yet. But like the consistency</li>
    <li> I’ve been using this every night before sleeping and it has drastically reduced the dark circles I used to get in the morning. I have a hectic schedule so more sleep is the obvious solution but for now this product will help clean me up a little bit in the mornings before work and dropping the kids off at school.</li>
    <li> Dark circles and puffiness are my biggest issues with my eyes until a friend introduced me to the NuNutrients Cucumber Eye Cream.  I doubted that it would work but I’ve used using it for three weeks and the results are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve used other products but, none gave me results like the NuNutrients Cucumber Eye Cream. Dark circles and puffiness are gone and replaced with a smooth and radiant face. I’m truly happy with this product.</li>
    <li> About equal to other brands around this same price. Its a good product. Amazon shipped it quickly.</li>
    <li> This eye cream flakes up on my face shortly after putting it on.  Initially it seems moisturizing and adds a sheen to your face; however shortly after it starts flaking up and makes me want to wash it off my face.  Also will flake if make up is applied over it.  I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife to try because we have a toddler and she doesn&#x27;t sleep well so constantly has dark circles under her eyes from lack of sleep. She tried this and her eyes look so much better. She was so happy I bought it and is getting more soon.</li>
    <li> Asian skin and dark circles don&#x27;t really go well -  and i hate to see those big dark circles around my eyes in every picture. No matter how much amount of makeup I do, I just couldn&#x27;t get rid of those ugly circles. Anyway, after a lot of research, I decided to invest in this cucumber based cream. As for the fact, cucumber is well known effective ingredient for bright eyes, I somehow knew this formulation will work for me. Along with cucumber, it has a number of whitening agents that make your dark circles disappear with constant use. I have been using the product for a month now and can already see my dark circles getting lighter. It comes in a easy to carry tub. Yes, it is a recommended product and you must try it out!</li>
    <li> God bless NuNutrients - Cucumber Eye Cream - Soothing Eye Cream.  I have dark circles under my eyes and have always been self conscious of this.  When I read about this product I decided to give it a try.  I did not have much to lose, the product was way cheaper than anything I could buy from the stores.  I received my order in no time and quickly put it to the test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I not only loved the feel of the silky smooth cream and the pleasant springy smell &amp;#34; IT WORKED&amp;#34;.  Words can not describe how happy this product has made me.  You will have a devoted faithful customer from now on.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but I&#x27;ve always had serious problems with dark circles under my eyes. All my friends growing up said I looked like an owl, which although hilarious, made me feel self conscious about my appearance. I&#x27;ve used a multitude of moisturizers and eye creams throughout my life, with limited success. Until I found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT ACTUALLY WORKS GUYS! My dark circles are gone! I don&#x27;t look like an owl anymore! I feel so much better about my appearance, and it&#x27;s had such a positive impact on my life.</li>
    <li> Lately I have been like my eyes were sagging, feeling tired and dry. Most days I have looong days in the office and then at home so I don&#x27;t usually have time for spas or to pamper myself. I noticed my coworker using this and asked for a small sample and I was hooked. I can just apply it and forget about it. It smells and feels so refreshing and relaxing. I&#x27;ve already gone through 2 containers of these-- it makes you relaxed and more confident about yourself. I don&#x27;t have to put on heavy makeup to smoothe the wrinkles and dark under eye circles--- thid product does all the work for you. Not only is it affordable and worth your money, but it&#x27;s an amazing investment that doubles your return.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!! This is 100%fake product and your eyes will itch. I used it for a few days and now in pain.</li>
    <li> Got rid of lines around my eyes. I first noticed it a few weeks ago and then decided to get rid of them. It was surprising to see something in the mirror that wasn&#x27;t there before. The cucumber feeling was nice and cool to the touch and finally the lines disappeared. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I used this every night before I go to bed around my eyes and on my face.  It helps smooth and refresh my skin leaving me looking more rested by morning.  I wish there was more in the container so I could be more generous with how much I could put on!</li>
    <li> People at work have noticed a new glow about me. I tell them I use this cucumber eye cream and that I use it nightly every single day. I think it&#x27;s cool that it exists--the cream reduces the lines around your eyes and makes me feel great every morning.</li>
    <li> Are you kidding me! I look 15 years younger!  I&#x27;ve had 3 kids in the past 5 years, that will take a toll on anyone&#x27;s sleep. I have noticed myself aging faster than I can even keep up with. It seems like every time I look in the mirror I look like a different, older, person.  After just a couple weeks of using the NuNutrients Eye Cream, I can already see difference.  Not to mention, the cucumber smell is absolutely fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is so smooth and calming, i could literally leave it on my face for days.  I&#x27;ve tried many of the other products on the market and this is bar none the best one. I will definitely be sticking with it.  Makes me feel young again!</li>
    <li> I hate it when my face gets wrinkles and doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;up to snuff.&amp;#34; It frustrates me to no end! I despise when my face has wrinkles, as well. So what do I do? I go online to try and find products to help. Luckily, I stumbled across NuNutrients. Ever since starting with their product, I&#x27;ve been happy. Even if it didn&#x27;t work for my wrinkles (it does), I&#x27;d buy it alone for the feel of the soothing power against my skin. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I love to laugh and I won’t stop laughing no matter how many laugh lines I get. Cucumber Eye Cream helps out a lot and helps me stay laughing.</li>
    <li> Seems like I’ve been getting older. I noticed some lines around my eyes so I searched for a solution. Found this cream on Amazon based on the reviews and I have to agree with most of them. I use it nightly and some of the smaller lines have dissipated. I think it is allowing my face to retain more water or something. However it works, it is pleasing to use and I enjoy the results very much.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to odors and this eye cream is made from cucumber extract, so it’s very soothing and does not have any astringent smells or anything that is oft putting.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo30DC0E7H0XJVY]]</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see results. Neither did my husband. I think it&#x27;s a scam. :/</li>
    <li> The areas around my eyes have drastically changed for the better. I am using this every day and after a week or a little more my face looks a lot better. I had some rings and some blemishes but they have just about disappeared. I am happy with the results and would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I saw a change in my circles after just a couple</li>
    <li> This eye cream is superior to others that I&#x27;ve tried. It can also be applied to the lids; which others claim and can&#x27;t.  I Highly recommend and will buy it again. This is the second time I have ordered it. It&#x27;s not oily so it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
    <li> Bought this mainly because the reviews were great but after going through an entire bottle I did not notice a big difference on my dark circles.  I have always had dark circles but the situation was made worse after suffering a broken nose, it&#x27;s been four months and I still find myself applying make up before heading out the door and this cream did not help.  Wish I could get my money back.  I will however say that this cream does make for a good facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Do not order! This product really just seems like your $2.99 drug store lotion. This is cucumber lotion, only. This does nothing to soothe, lift, or deeply moisturize. Move on to another product. I was pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love it! It makes your eyes feel calm, cool, and relaxed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it works for some people, but I had a bad reaction to this product. My eyes got really red after a few days of use, and caused eye aches.</li>
    <li> The over all results of the cucumber eye cream have been good. The puffiness I experience has diminished. I also like the cooling sensation when u put it on, it feels nice on the sensitive skin around my eyes. The one thing I wish it did was help my dark circles a little more. I still think it&#x27;s a great product and I have recommended it to friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dark undereye circles since I was in my 20s – I figured it was something I was just stuck with. Add on four kids, limited sleep, a diet that isn&#x27;t always the healthiest, and a decade or so… let&#x27;s just say the dark circle problem did not improve. And then came the day when I was applying eyeliner and realized that the corners of my eyes now had teeny little wrinkles that the eyeliner pen was getting hung up on – ugh! And that&#x27;s when I started researching and following a much stricter skin care regimen to try to slow down the horrible things that were happening to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using NuNutrients - Cucumber Eye Cream for about three weeks now, and the results are pretty dramatic. The dark circles are lighter than they were, and the skin around my eyes looks firmer (less saggy). I didn&#x27;t really have any visible puffiness to my eyes before, but the skin under my eyes felt kind of &amp;#34;mushy&amp;#34; before, and now it feels firmer in addition to being less purple-colored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a tiny bit of this gel to cover the entire eye area – one full pump dispenses enough gel to cover not only the area around both eyes but also my entire forehead (as I learned on first use – now I just dispense a half-pump of the gel, so as not to waste this miracle stuff!)</li>
    <li> I hate how often I get dark circles under my eyes! One of my friends gave me this to try. I have noticed that she doesn&#x27;t seem to have dark circles nearly as much as I do. Furthermore, I also like how it is safe for all types of skin since I sometimes have irritated skin. Also, I like that is has cucumber. I have read a lot about how cucumber is good for skin. So after trying this product, I noticed somewhat of an improvement. I am really happy that I don&#x27;t always look like I need sleep!</li>
    <li> This is the best product that I have used for a firmer, smoother skin. I have been using this product for a while now and I can feel the difference. I had tried various anti-aging, anti-wrinkle creams and lotions and various other eye creams but nothing is as good or comparable to this one. Right from the first use, you can tell the difference with the firmer skin around the eyes. The cucumber eye cream is good for your eyes and it helps in reducing the fine lines and wrinkles. Give it a try guys, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for seven days and I am completely amazed at the results!! The wrinkles under my eyes are so much better. I am working too much with computer and after working nights I have circles around eyes. It actually helps with my dark circles. One more plus - really good smell. Cucumber cream brings satisfaction. I prefer use it ones a day before night.</li>
    <li> Very cooling....refreshing eye cream. Bit pricy for amount</li>
    <li> Dark circles, wrinkles, crows feet, I had it all. Now, after using NuNutrients my skin is better than ever! It made me wonder why I didn&#x27;t use it sooner! Definitely recommend to anyone looking to improve their skin!</li>
    <li> Wow, this eye cream worked wonders on the dark circles around my eyes and has a very pleasant overall soothing effect. It feels so great to put on that it has become a staple to my beauty routine. I would highly recomend to any women who wants to have a great feeling and looking face.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love the smell!</li>
    <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been noticing the dark circle and bags under my eyes....not a lot, but they are starting.  I&#x27;ve used this cream for 3 weeks now and I can honestly say that I have noticed a BIG difference.  Smoother, less dark, and overall better appearance.  I&#x27;d like to finish this jar and then continue another round with a second jar to see how things progress.  Overall a good product.</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend. She was always complaining about how she had these dark eye circles and she always thought they were unattractive. So I got this for her and she likes it. Makes the dark spots fade away and I honestly admit it makes her look a lot younger now. She told her friend about it while we had her for dinner and her friend is in love with it just as much as her</li>
    <li> I have always had dark circles, and bad. I have tried everything to get rid of them, aside from creams...because I am young still(haha). But a friend suggested this one and wow! I noticed a difference after the first use. I love the smell of it and everything. Great, miraculous product!</li>
    <li> Felt and smelled very natural.  It cooled down my skin around the my eyes. Say goodbye to puffy eyes. Good product!</li>
    <li> I’ve used so many skin products it’s insane. And I have to say for the value, this one might be the champion. It has a great quality cucumber cream and it feels great on the eyes, and most of all the results speak for themselves.</li>
    <li> My skin is sooo smooth now! I bought this product because my cousin recommended it and it has simply been amazing! I apply it to my eyes and my cheeks and I noticed the dark circles around my eyes have reduced by a lot, my cheeks are also less wrinkly and my skin in general feels very soft. This product does what it says it does. I recommend it for any mothers like myself!</li>
    <li> I just received this so I am not sure how it is going to do on the dark circles but, it feels wonderful on my eyes and it is very hydrating.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Just like other reviews have said, I think it&#x27;s tough to put a price on looking youthful, since that quality is so revered in our society. But if you had to put a price on it, NuNutrients comes out on top, because as far as I can see it&#x27;s cheaper than most other things that do similar results, which is good. Face feels smoother, no bumps, no bags, no puffiness. Feels good on the skin, smells great. Excellent.</li>
    <li> It is sticky and doesn&#x27;t do anything for my dark circles.  A waste of money, I think.  The cream looks very nice in its jar, though, but I think that&#x27;s where it will stay -- in the jar.</li>
    <li> Ah! The cucumber scent. It’s so fashionable that I am glad this product also keeps my skin and eyes looking great and youthful. I also get the benefits of breathing in such a great, clean scent. And it’s very attractive to people, they notice me coming in and it’s not a gross feeling like cologne or perfume. It’s like “oh a clean person has just walked into the room, and she has such nice skin.”</li>
    <li> I bought one jar and while I was happy with the product I wanted to research the company that makes it.  I could not find anything out there... however when I googled the ingredients list I found several other products with the same ingredients in the same order, same wording/directions....  I ordered one and it is the same thing as far as I can tell.  I only paid $14.00 for the other &amp;#34;brand name&amp;#34;, seems like it might have been a repackage with an upped price.</li>
    <li> I used to have chronic swelling around my eyes, leading to generally unattractive blotchy redness. I thought it would improve if I just got more sleep, but alas the puffiness would not go away! I heard about the wonders of cucumber cream, and decided to try this as I trust NuNutrients products. After about two weeks, all signs of blotchiness went away and now my face feels smooth and taut once again! I used to get people asking me if I was getting enough sleep, annoyingly I never knew what it was. I have since used substantially less applications, and it is still working great. I now swear by cucumber extracts for all of my skin products.</li>
    <li> I naturally have a darker under eye color and I have tried lots of make ups and products but i was looking for something that promises to be more permanent.&lt;br /&gt;  I decided to try this product I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 days and I feel like I already feel/see a difference. I feel like my under eye color has already become lighter and less puffy tired looking. A great natural product. I am very happy 👍</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s get a little personal here, a very close family member became paralyzed after a bike accident. I&#x27;ve spent the last 10 month traveling from clinic to clinic, working hard at retraining him how to walk. I cannot even begin to tell you how old I began to look because of all my newly-found wrinkles! Crows feet and brow lines like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.&lt;br /&gt;A friend sent me this lotion in a care package and I had to come back to say thank you! This gave me back my confidence and smile. Whomever created this wonderful lotion- cheers to them!&lt;br /&gt;You absolutely cannot beat affordable and COMPLETELY natural ingredients with proven results. I know I&#x27;ll be a long-time customer!</li>
    <li> Feels very soothing around the eyes</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cooling eye cream. I use this when I&#x27;ve had a hard day and wanna relax my puffy face or if my eyes have those unsightly bags/ dark circles I get when I&#x27;m working to meet a deadline. It definitely makes me feel pampered even if I&#x27;m just sitting at home. The smell is soothing too if you&#x27;re into aromatherapy, which I am. I should note that I have sensitive skin and tend to breakout from a lot of lotions and creams. This cream passes my sensitivity test. I&#x27;ll be adding this to my list of gifts to give, for the hard working ladies in my life.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t help my eye area.  In fact, it made my eye area worse. I&#x27;m giving it two stars because I did finish the product as a facial moisturizer. I&#x27;ve gone back to a best selling eye gel on Amazon that only cost $19 and seems to actually work for me.</li>
    <li> I have always had very noticeable dark circles under my eyes (bad genes, I guess!)  They are even more prominent when I get less than eight hours of sleep, so....always.  I&#x27;ve been trying to find a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; eye cream that really works since I was 16 years old, and to give you an idea how long it&#x27;s been, I just celebrated my fourth 29th birthday. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NuNutrients Cucumber Eye Cream is the best thing to ever happen to my skin care routine. It feels good, it smells good, and- get this- it actually works!  My circles are less noticeable and any puffiness immediately goes away after I put this on. I don&#x27;t think anything will completely get rid of my dark circles since they are so pronounced, but this is good enough for me. I have tried every product out there, and nothing else works even half as well. You will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> feels great, don&#x27;t know if it actually works but the smell and feeling on my skin is great.</li>
    <li> This product is very soothing and it’s great for getting rid of circles around your eyes. Nobody wants to see that. A tip I heard and use is that I stick it in the refrigerator and then when I use it, it’s really cool and has a cucumber flavor to it. It makes the entire experience pretty neat and relaxing.</li>
    <li> the smell gave me a migraine. It appeared to be a good product. I forgot to see if it had a fragrance so it was my fault.</li>
    <li> Helps reduce puffiness naturally</li>
    <li> I have tried so many eye creams....but after trying this one, I&#x27;m not trying another! The cream is really light and doesn&#x27;t have a harsh, medicine-like smell at all. The cream rubs in really well, and doesn&#x27;t give a greasy feeling after you put it on. When you put it on, you&#x27;ll just need a dab. Within a week I started seeing major results! The skin under my eyes was definitely more toned without feeling super tight, and there is no itch or irritation when you apply it. Always apply it right after you wash your face, and when I apply it before bed, I apply a little more than in the morning. I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of concealer anymore. I would definitely continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have dark circles, Just puffy eyes. I need to face the truth nothing works. I&#x27;m a man so I don&#x27;t see myself wearing concealer and makeup.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty useless. I have bags under my eyes and swelling most mornings. They are not absolutely horrible as I am only 33 years old but I anticipate them getting worse over time. I have used this product for 4 days and not only are my bags still there but the swelling is at least twice as bad. I bought this product because of the great reviews but once my eyes started to get worse, I noticed that only a few of the 5 star reviews were from verified amazon purchases. This makes me believe that a bunch of clowns went on and gave reviews for a product they have never tried. I actually saw another reviewer comment on exactly the same thing but was hoping they were wrong but after my eyes getting worse, I think he was right. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed. Not just because the product didn&#x27;t work, but because those reviews seem to be false.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any reviewers who have my problem. Really wanted to like this eye cream because I was ready for a change from Olay. The first time I applied the cream, I dotted it around my eyes as shown. Less than 5 minutes had passed before my eyes started burning and felt like all moisture in both eyes had dried up. Had to wash cream off and my eyes bothered me all night. Next night I more carefully dotted cream around eyes because I thought maybe some had gotten in my eyes the first time. Again, eyes started burning, eyes dried out and had to wash cream off. The third night I tested the cream on the top of cheek bones, an inch away from eyes. Same thing happened with burning eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will not be anymore tests for me and I have wasted money since this cost was twice what Olay costs.  Actually this is the only eye cream that has affected my eyes in such a painful way, and I have many, many years of experiences with eye creams.</li>
    <li> I have been feeling dry around my eyes lately, and the skin crackles a bit. Don’t want to develop wrinkles so I’ve been using this cream. Love it. It works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I use this cream for my wrinkles and dark circles under my eyes. From the results that I have witnessed on my own skin, i would swear by it&#x27;s effectiveness.I would recommend that those of you who are looking to have a brighter, smoother look when people look into your eyes get this product and use it, you will not be disappointed. Absolutely a great product!</li>
    <li> I love the cucumber smell and I feel so fresh and healthy every time I use this cream. I can feel it working and firming up my skin and I can feel how much smoother my skin is after suing the cream. At this rate the cream is working better at making the lines around my eyes go away better than my actual make-up. Also a great cream to use for streatch marks and forehead wrinkles. Very soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to redefine my look, this Cucumber eye cream is really miraculous in taking the dark lines away. I was in awe the first day my purple and deep lines under my eyes had gone away. My eyes look bright and I look awake and alive at work, it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I was battling with dark rings around my eyes and at 25 that&#x27;s hard to deal with. I began using NuNutrients Cucumber Eye Cream and I must say it&#x27;s great.  This cream is soothing and refreshing. It lighted the circles and I&#x27;m feeling more confident. No woman should have to live with dark circles.  Buy this cream and use as directed, it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> This cream works wonders. Upon learning about the 100% money back guarantee, I figured I&#x27;d have nothing to lose if I gave it a shot. Within the first two weeks, the dark spots surrounding my eyes had already begun to diminish! Today, two months later, I have ZERO signs of dark circles and my appearance looks about ten years younger I&#x27;d say. I recommend this product to anyone. It works. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain with this one.</li>
    <li> This product works brilliantly! It is hydrating and refreshing, and I&#x27;ve seen a great improvement with my under eye circles with daily use. As a college student often I run on very little sleep and this cream has been an enormous help. It is soothing, and gets the job done like no other!</li>
    <li> This cucumber cream should have ten stars.I mean my eyes arevalways super puffy.I work as a night shift nurse and I often get off work and go on to appointments and my children&#x27;s school.People often say you look so tired.Thats not good to hear. I&#x27;ve been using the cream for 3 weeks and I am totally excited!</li>
    <li> Cucumber, wow guys that is a great idea! My mom just got this product and her skin was so fresh and soft after used it. Her look is more fresh and you know what I don&#x27;t need it but I ma using for also. We need to buy really soon because now my sister want to feel the same freshness!</li>
