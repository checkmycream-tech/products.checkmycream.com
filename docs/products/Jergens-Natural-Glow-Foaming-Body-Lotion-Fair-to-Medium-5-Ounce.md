      <li>Its nice to use in the winter</li>
      <li>If I had to use a sunless tanning product, this would be it but even for my fair skin that easily burns</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like putting a really good lotion on your skin that just happens to darken to a nice, light tan.  </li>
      <li>and I burn very easily in the sun.  </li>

      <li>Love this stuff for the color it brings out in my skin.</li>

      <li>otherwise it&#x27;ll look like you were touching an umpa-lumpa.</li>
      <li>I like to exfoliate but cannot do so when using this since it just colors the top layers of the skin, which is just what it is supposed to do.  </li>
      <li>It is so much better than anything I have tried.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend this product to anyone who likes a healthy looking colour on there skin but without the sun .</li>
      <li>Ok - lets get it out of the way up front.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it might not work as well for everyone, but as someone who has tried almost everything else, I couldn&#x27;t reccomend it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I just put scented lotion over the top and it was gone.</li>
      <li>I love this product but I will no longer buy it.  </li>
      <li>And I&#x27;ve tried many, including the orangey-toned, original ones years ago!  </li>
      <li>It evens the skin naturally and beautifully :)</li>
      <li>It is light &amp; airy, thus it spreads on very easily.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a blond kid, so my skin is pretty fair or medium</li>
      <li>I really like how nice my \\&quot;tan\\&quot; looks with using this product!</li>
      <li>maybe that is because my A/C is out, and I live in Atlanta, lol.</li>
      <li>Great product, I will use it next year when the weather is warm again.</li>
      <li>I am a very very fair red head.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very fair, and I haven&#x27;t gotten streaks with it, so that is a big plus.  </li>

      <li>My boyfriend wouldn&#x27;t come near me all summer if I was using it, LOL.  </li>

      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell after you apply it (or if it does, I honestly don&#x27;t notice) and it gives a nice soft looking tan, no orange tint.  </li>
      <li>dries VERY quickly and is never streaky.</li>
      <li>It does not have a strong odor - but to avoid having the &amp;#34;self-tanner&amp;#34; smell</li>
      <li>and it will be fine.  </li>
      <li>(clicking sound</li>
      <li>I have light skin that eventually tans</li>
      <li>this product, thats how smooth the foam is to spread.</li>
      <li>For the cheap price I paid for this, I&#x27;m almost in disbelief at how well it worked.  </li>
      <li>Leaves skin moist and smooth.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s just a light sunblock/tan scent.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was diagonised with skin cancer sept 2013 so was told by my skin specialist than I could not afford to get my skin burnt or even tanned no more , I&#x27;ve always had fair skin so decided to try this product through a friend giving mr a sample of the lotion wow it was great air gouge took ages to dry , then on a visit to the states last year found they done a mousse in this product even better and drys really quick . Would recommend this product to anyone who likes a healthy looking colour on there skin but without the sun .</li>
    <li> I am very fair-skinned and simply cannot tan; All I need is simply the look of having had a little healthy sun on my skin. This product, alas, does not live up to the hype. Yes, it has a smell... and the smell does NOT go away. Worse, it streaks. Yes, it does.&lt;br /&gt;So now my legs look like a skin-tone Jackson Pollack painting. And it IS a little orangey.&lt;br /&gt;Try something else.&lt;br /&gt;Jergens can do better than this.</li>
    <li> I am one of those people who rarely writes reviews, but after using this product I wanted to share... I have light skin that eventually tans so I started with the fair to medium.  It goes on easy, dries fast, doesn&#x27;t streak (from the areas I can see).  I noticed a few other reviewers said it smells bad, but I put lots of it on and didn&#x27;t notice any strong odors.  I used it every other day for about a week and my skin has a nice, natural looking color.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it seems to settle/appear darker in hair follicles on my legs - my fix was applying a light moisturizer first then using the foam on days I didn&#x27;t shave.  Other than that this was the best inexpensive self-tanner I&#x27;ve ever tried.  And I&#x27;ve tried many, including the orangey-toned, original ones years ago!  The biggest plus was how fast it dries, the lotion took forever, seems to feel sticky throughout the day until my next shower.  This dries quickly and leaves skin feeling smooth.  Overall a great and healthy alternative to a real suntan and more convenient and cheaper than a professional spraytan!</li>
    <li> I have used the Fair to Medium lotion for a while now and liked the results the best over other self-tanners I have tried (including Lancome and Christian Dior). But, this is so great because it dries really quickly (you can get dressed after 5 minutes), results look as natural as the lotion, and there is not much of a smell that I can detect. The lotion still has a faux tanner smell, but this really doesn&#x27;t. It does have a slight scent, but unlike a previous reviewer, it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I have fair skin and with the mousse, I have a bit of a natural-looking tan a few hours after using it. With the lotion, it took at least two applications to achieve the same tan level. Though the mousse doesn&#x27;t last as long as the lotion, this fact negates that concern for me. Also, it is SO much easier/more pleasant to use this mousse in the heat of the summer than the lotion, which takes much longer to dry and until then, feels icky. Ultimately, I really like this self-tanner. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because as the \\&quot;tan\\&quot; fades, it fades unevenly.</li>
    <li> First let me say, this is the first sunless tanner product I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;ve read some reviews of people complaining about the smell. I have no idea why. It&#x27;s not too strong and it smells great. Love the scent. I&#x27;m a blond kid, so my skin is pretty fair or medium I&#x27;d say. I had some tan left over from the summer, but I&#x27;m pretty white. This product WOULD be great, but I just didn&#x27;t get the color I expected. I&#x27;ve used this product 1-2 times daily for over a week, and almost no noticeable difference. I&#x27;ve been putting it on my left thigh and not my right the whole time, to compare my legs after a week. It&#x27;s been over a week and still they&#x27;re both fairly pasty white. In the right light, it&#x27;s noticable, but for the most part you can&#x27;t tell. This stuff just doesn&#x27;t make my skin look darker. Maybe it&#x27;s just me? I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m going to try the stuff made for darker tan skin next time.  Pros:  -Smells great. Like maple syrup kinda, but better, and not thick and sticky haha  -Dries almost instantly  -applies evenly  -cheap  -leaves skin feeling great and soft  -not sticky  -the small amount of color it does leave is natural-looking  Cons:  -Used over a week I can barely tell any difference. Doesn&#x27;t make me look darker.</li>
    <li> For some reason, I always forget that I CAN get a tan. Not a natural one, of course. The best I can do is freckle and/or burn. I forget about tanning products, because in the past I&#x27;ve had bad experiences turning orange or streaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this foam three days in a row. It is very subtle, so don&#x27;t expect immediate results. I really like it BECAUSE it is subtle, making it nearly impossible to streak yourself. It also has a \\&quot;natural glow,\\&quot; so I&#x27;m not worried about turning orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foam dries really quickly, and I don&#x27;t think it smells bad. There is a faint scent, which can easily be cloaked with a spritz of body spray. Otherwise, it&#x27;s just a light sunblock/tan scent.</li>
    <li> It leaves you a little orange but not so orangy where it looks really bad.  It does the job.  It doesn&#x27;t smell good.  My sheets smell like it now.  I used to use a self tanner about 15 years ago when they were getting big, and it smelled like rotten yogurt then.  I don&#x27;t know why they still haven&#x27;t been able to mask the smell because this one smells a little like rotten yogurt too.  As long as you apply each night and quick rinse in the morning to get rid of the smell, it works just fine. Don&#x27;t forget to wash your hands really well, especially your palms!  otherwise it&#x27;ll look like you were touching an umpa-lumpa.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I did want to say a little bit about this self-tanner.  I have used Jergens self-tanning lotion in the past but hated the smell and I found it sometimes made me look a little orange in spots.  I now use the Natural Glow Foaming Daily Moisturizer and I love the effect!  It doesn&#x27;t smell after you apply it (or if it does, I honestly don&#x27;t notice) and it gives a nice soft looking tan, no orange tint.  Also, I can notice the effect after only one use!  I definitely would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product is great because the self tan smell is not present, but I&#x27;ve used almost the whole can spraying my legs in several coats of this spray over the course of only 2 days but did not see hardly any difference in my color. I tried a true blue spa bronze bombshell before that-and it worked amazingly, but it&#x27;s no longer sold in stores so I decided to try this one out. You may have to use the whole bottle before seeing any change in color.</li>
    <li> This product is sooo much better than the cream or lotion.  It is light &amp; airy, thus it spreads on very easily.  I have stocked up as I had problems trying to find this version for quite awhile.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot because it has a good price tag, it isn&#x27;t streaky, and doesn&#x27;t make your tan look uneven.  However, one down fall to this product is it truly needs to be applied EVERY day otherwise it fades so fast!</li>
    <li> I just got this stuff yesterday and I am already seeing results. Because I&#x27;m in a college dorm, I wanted something that would dry quickly so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to walk around (half) naked. This stuff meets my requirements! I&#x27;m impressed. Just be careful around your knuckles and wrists. Although I&#x27;m sure this is an issue with any other self tanner and that putting lotion on those spots beforehand will help. Overall, I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Works great, no streaks love the color</li>
    <li> I really like how nice my \\&quot;tan\\&quot; looks with using this product! I&#x27;m very fair, and I haven&#x27;t gotten streaks with it, so that is a big plus.  And no smell after it dries (and it dries fast!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To avoid the \\&quot;orange palms\\&quot; dilemma, I use a pair of vinyl gloves (can be purchased at most drug stores -- and can be reused several times).  Also, it takes a little practice to get the correct amount of foam to dispense from the can; be careful or way too much might come out!  I find that a golf-ball sized amount of foam is just about right to do each leg, and then one the same size does both arms and chest.  You&#x27;ll have to experiment to get the right amount for your application needs, but I am really impressed and plan to keep using it!</li>
    <li> If you take even a day off from using this lotion you will see quite a difference in the color of your skin.  I only used it on my legs as my upper body is tanned from the sun, but since I dont wear my bathing suit everywhere my legs are not.  I love that it gave my color and did not look fake.  Its smooth overall, a little sticky, but that wears off within seconds.  I like to exfoliate but cannot do so when using this since it just colors the top layers of the skin, which is just what it is supposed to do.  Great product, I will use it next year when the weather is warm again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years.  Works great for extra pale skin- goes on even and doesn&#x27;t look orange.  Dries quick</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. My skin goes from ghostly white to fairly tan after a couple applications, and looks very natural! The mousse is much easier to apply than lotions, no streaking, and no orange tint! LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Does not apply evenly and is very very streaky. Also has an orange hue. I have tried to give it a chance several times. Disappointing product</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin, i decided not to tan any longer because it is so damaging to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I thought being tan wasn&#x27;t going to happen for me but this lotion is really nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some positive things about it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. it spreads on nicely&lt;br /&gt;2. it doesn&#x27;t look orange!&lt;br /&gt;3. it dries fast so it doesn&#x27;t get on my sheets&lt;br /&gt;4. looks natural&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are is a negative thing about it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle nozzle (for me at least) wasn&#x27;t perfect, when you use it be prepared for A LOT to come out. be very careful when pushing down on it, also i noticed that it doesn&#x27;t really stop coming out afterwards, i would push it and use it and the bottle would still be spraying some out and it got messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noticed a nice glow and slight tan the next day! and its day 2 and i look like i went tanning at the salon on high for a bit, love it and will continue to buy it. im just hoping it doesn&#x27;t run out fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its only my second day of using it, the second day i only put solution over parts i missed so i look completely even and i do. I feel like i have a nice glowy non orange tan and im so happy.</li>
    <li> So...  get this.  Do.  It&#x27;s lovely.  But don&#x27;t get it from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it twice.  The first time, when it came dented, missing a cap, and clearly used I sent a very angry email to the seller who DID NOT APOLOGIZE for the disgusting shipment but just sent a matter of fact they&#x27;ll send another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second came, also dented and used (with a cap this time and the top wasnt&#x27; dirty like the first but the directions clearly say it&#x27;ll make a clicking sound when you first use it and this click had obviously already happened.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave up and didn&#x27;t bother, ran it through hot hater and spray out a bunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since bought a new one at cvs.  (clicking sound happened).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is lovely and works well if you use it at least 4 or 5 times a week.  The seller is terrible.</li>
    <li> Used this for 5 days in a row and there was a definite change in the color of my skin.  Be careful around ankles, feet, elbows and knees.  Make sure it is applied evenly.  And doing a light coat on ears is a good idea if hair is short or you are going to pull it back.  I liked it and found it great for brightening up fair, white legs. But, I did not put it evenly on my feet and it showed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, if you want some color that definitely increases with each use, this is a good product. My husband said it is orange.  I do not agree. It served a purpose in early spring when my legs were pasty white and I had an event to attend and shorts were in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS BEFORE AND REALLY LIKE IT.  IT DOESN&#x27;T STREAK AND BLOTCH LIKE SO MANY OF THE LOTIONS AND CREAMS.  IT IS ABSORBED QUICKLY AND GIVES YOU A GRADUAL COLOR.</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner that I have used. It drys fast, moistens your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a smell after drying. As with all tanning lotions remember to wash your hands afterwards and don&#x27;t worry it will not turn your knee&#x27;s or elbows orange.</li>
    <li> Who new! Foam it is. All my friends (and some strangers who asked) are trying this now! I can&#x27;t handle Jergen&#x27;s lotion, it looks like I went finger-painting. But this passes as natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful to not over-apply. It also needs to be exfoliated and re-applied by the end of the week so your pores don&#x27;t collect more color than your surface skin. Good for really white complexions, I am no longer embarrassing myself.</li>
    <li> I love this product but I will no longer buy it.  If you rub it in thoroughly, you will not have any streaks.  I am fair and it gives me a natural color.  Not orange.  If anyone gets streaks, or claims to turn orange, they have yet to perfect the application of sunless tanners.  Unfortunately, I will not be buying this product again.  Jergens, please leave out the parabens!  Propylparaben, in particular, is bad news. Jergens, please clean up your products.  My new go to product is a more natural option.  Unfortunately, I have yet to find one in the form of a foam (which I had grown to love).  However, the creams are going to have to do.</li>
    <li> I used to prefer the lotion, but the foam dries so much faster and is easier to apply. Make sure you evenly coat the best you can to avoid gaps in color, but they are subtle even if you do mess up. Make sure you wash your hands (especially the web part of your fingers) afterwards. It takes about 2 days to start to see color and its nothing deep or dark but a nice glow that rids you of the pasty white lol I&#x27;m not embarrassed to wear shorts to bed now haha You can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion!  It is so much better than anything I have tried.  Comes out as a foam and a little bit goes a long way.  Yipeeeee</li>
    <li> Sunless tanning products are great for Oompa Loompa cosplayers. Luckily I used this product (according to the directions) at the beginning of my weekend so that if something went wrong it had time to fade. This product isn&#x27;t all bad. It&#x27;s cheap! The smell is not fowl and it doesn&#x27;t streak like many other sunless tanning products. The tan it gives looks alright indoors but outdoors it looks completely artificial. The key chemical works by reacting with enzymes on the surface of your skin. Sun goes skin deep and activated melanocytes to produce melanin. If I had to use a sunless tanning product, this would be it but even for my fair skin that easily burns I think I&#x27;m better off building a tan the natural way.</li>
    <li> This is very sticky..and you really have to commit to applying it absolutely everywhere every day.  Just not very practical.  And it smells bad.</li>
    <li> I should have known better!  This product has an odor just as all self tanners!  It also feels sticky and gummy on my skin.  My bra also stained after wearing it 12 hours after application of this product.  The stain will NOT wash out.  I am very disappointed in the results.</li>
    <li> This is the best self-tanner that I have tried, but it can still look a little orange in direct sun light. You have to use it daily in order to maintain the color, but it is easy to apply and dries quickly.</li>
    <li> I like the way this foam spreads. It is not too greasy, or too dry. A handful of the foam spreads nicely, and covers two legs. It is not a dryish foam. I am not worried about streaks w/this product, thats how smooth the foam is to spread. Much better than the lotion by far. I&#x27;m using it for the first time, and I&#x27;m not finding that it dries really quickly, but maybe that is because my A/C is out, and I live in Atlanta, lol. That said, it took about 5-7 minutes for it to soak in, and be touchable. Have always loved the Jergens products, and like this one the best for spreading more evenly, drying more quickly, and having that same subtle color. It is if nothing else a great moisturizer! There is NO smell what so ever, but I actually do like the self tanning smell, lol.</li>
    <li> I like the foam versus the lotion,The foam absorbs quickly and the color I get is totally natural and gives me a little glow.&lt;br /&gt;I am very fair skinned so this product looks the most natural on me.</li>
    <li> This is the best self-tanning product I have every used! I am very fair and only want a bit of color;this product is perfect- dries VERY quickly and is never streaky. I am ordering it online because I cannot find it in any stores- most seem to only carry the medium to dark shade and that is too dark for me. It does not have a strong odor - but to avoid having the &amp;#34;self-tanner&amp;#34; smell I will apply it an hour or so before bed and then shower as usual in the morning.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! You actually do get a nice glowing tan! The foam is easier to apply without getting  streaks.</li>
    <li> Product works pretty well and very quickly, I noticed the difference within only a couple of hours of my first application. There was minimal streaking on the paler parts of my skin such as my feet and the underside of my wrist, this is quickly fixable with a make up wipe though.  You don&#x27;t really have to use a whole lot for your entire body either as the foam expands a lot in your hands, so you are left with a lot of the product for future applications. This is great for the cheap price, will definitely purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to give me a light, barely discernible tan when in fact it gave me a very obvious &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;. Its nice to use in the winter but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend only using it two or three times a week.</li>
    <li> This is really good on my fair skin.  Gives me a realistic glow.</li>
    <li> I thought this would help me get a nice soft tan, but at the end of the day it left me orange. Inside it looked fine, but when I went outside you could really tell - and I felt so embarrassed.</li>
    <li> The tan does begin to work, is non-streaky and gradual, and natural toned on my olive skin. However, there IS a smell, much like other tanning products. Also if you sweat a lot, even a day or two after using the product, brown beads of sweat begin to roll off your body and stain your clothes. Embarrassing in yoga class...</li>
    <li> This stuff has the most offensive smell.  Its sticky and it leaves a residue on my skin that is unpleasant against my clothes.  Do not buy this product.  The company says no self tanner smell, well that smell would be much better then the gross smell it has now.</li>
    <li> Works very good.  I always use the lotion version but this works a bit faster....I am a regular colored white girl and it tans me enough that I don&#x27;t wear nylons at work. :)</li>
    <li> Ok - lets get it out of the way up front.  ALL self tanning products have some kind of odor.  Get zen with it or go get a real tan out in the sun.  The odor issue is nothing new.  In the past, when I used the lotion formula of this product(and many other self tanner lotions - yes, I have tried them all) the odor was constant for days.  You were either using it and you were smelly all the time or you weren&#x27;t and you were pale.  My boyfriend wouldn&#x27;t come near me all summer if I was using it, LOL.  With the mousse formula, thankfully the smell fades after about an hour.  It is quite strong when you first apply it, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting it on right before you go somewhere, but after the product really fully dries the odor does eventually go away.  I find the color to be fine - am Casper the friendly Irish Girl and orangey products on me would look very dramatic. This is not orangey at all.  For those who think it is, I would suggest you are probably trying to use a shade too dark for your skin tone.  Try the next lighter shade formula.  It&#x27;s meant to build color gradually, so use the product as intended.  For my extra white skin, I see a nice glow after the first application and start to look \\&quot;tan\\&quot; (meaning normal human skin color - all you whiteys will know what I mean) after about the second.  Since it does build gradually, I don&#x27;t feel like I have to be extra careful applying it.  Don&#x27;t go crazy but just be reasonably even with your application and it will be fine.  For the money, I feel Jergens is probably the best in the category.  I have also tried the $30 versions from Sephora but they have all the same issues, so why waste your money?</li>
    <li> Love this product, it tans so well and does not streak.  Price is also low</li>
    <li> I was so excited to order this and when it got here i did a deep exfoliation and shaved and put it on.. I woke up the next day and I was ORANGE!!!!!!!! It doesn&#x27;t dry in seconds it takes like 20 minutes to dry and i will give it credit since it does change the color of your skin but it makes you look like you got raped by a Dorito</li>
    <li> I was amazed by the lack of streaks. I have tried many brands from inexpensive to very expensive and they all streaked or grabbed ankles/heels. The fragrance is nice even though I can detect a hint of the \\&quot;tanner\\&quot; scent. I just put scented lotion over the top and it was gone. This is the first self-tanner that I will buy again.</li>
    <li> The foaming lotion applied evenly and worked well, not too much color and no smell. No streaks, I would buy again</li>
    <li> Leaves skin moist and smooth. No more scaly dry legs.</li>
    <li> First of all I have been sunless tanning for about 15 years and I have tried everything.  I have very fair Irish skin and I burn very easily in the sun.  This is seriously the best product I have used! I have used the lotion for quite a while, but the smell was driving me nuts as well as the fact that it took forever to dry.  This foam has solved both of those problems for me! Virtually no smell and it is very quick to dry.  It is very easy to put on and much faster than the lotion.  I don&#x27;t have to use as much product when applying.  The key to a smooth application and no streaking is yellow kitchen gloves.  Cut them off though so they just go to your wrists!  Works wonders for application and no orange palms!! I actually have been using this twice a day.  Once after my shower in the morning and also before bed.  This has given me a very quick tan in just a couple of days!  Awesome product!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff for the color it brings out in my skin. The lotion by same company does not bring as rich a color, and the lotion is STREAKY, whereas the mousse is not. HOWEVER, the mouse if very drying to the skin, whereas the lotion is moisturizing. Darn, I have to choose between moisture or great color???</li>
    <li> I love the Jergens natural glow products.  I am a very very fair red head.  These products are gentle to my skin.  I like the shuttle  change to a tan.</li>
    <li> This is not only a great tanner, but the best moisturizer.  It&#x27;s not greasy, yet spreads very well when applying.  It&#x27;s like putting a really good lotion on your skin that just happens to darken to a nice, light tan.  Love it!</li>
    <li> this is the best tanning product i have ever used.  it gives realistic color and doesn&#x27;t smell!  i bought another bottle right away because i was afraid i would run out on vacation, but it lasts and lasts.  i still have the new bottle, and much of the first one.  the only negative is that it is a bit sticky at first, but dries very quickly, and the stickiness goes away.  being naturally very pale, i don&#x27;t like the way i look in a bathing suit, but this lotion made it ok to be seen at the beach.  i love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This works!  I am so happy with it.  Fair skinned and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin orange.</li>
    <li> No streaks, but even on someone as white as me, it takes a long time to build up.  By the time I had color, I had to shave again and it all came off!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised .</li>
    <li> If you want to read a hell of a review, look no further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll preface this by saying that I&#x27;m a 21 year old male with very, very fair skin.  My whole life I&#x27;ve struggled with only suffering from burns, and not reaping any of the benefits of spending time in the sun, like tanning.  I was tired of sitting down and seeing my bright white thighs, or looking at myself in a picture with my friends looking like a foreigner in another country.  Needless to say, I wanted a change, but even after reading everything there is about tanning online, I spent countless hours in the sun with expensive tanning lotion on, only to realize I had wasted my time.  Nothing happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided to try self-tanners despite friends (and my girlfriend) telling me I would look orange, streaked, and just plain bad.  I was still determined.  After doing some research online, I went with Jergens.  I took a shower, used an exfoliating scrub, and was freaking out before using the product (although it said it takes multiple applications to see a difference).  I stripped my clothes off and made sure to apply the foam evenly and liberally all over, then walked around my apartment for 15 minutes while it dried.  That night I looked at my hands in between my fingers to realize that I had missed a spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wait!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How could I know that already?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was 1-2 shades darker all over my body.  I didn&#x27;t look orange or &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;.  I went out with friends that night who thought I was finally able to tan because apparently I looked great.  That was four days ago and I still have almost the exact same color I did that night.  I&#x27;m sure it will fade soon, but I&#x27;m confident that after re-applying Jergens it will go back to how it was.  For the cheap price I paid for this, I&#x27;m almost in disbelief at how well it worked.  Also, the slight smell went away after 6 hours.  I&#x27;m sure it might not work as well for everyone, but as someone who has tried almost everything else, I couldn&#x27;t reccomend it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Make sure to shower first and use a body scrub&lt;br /&gt;-Apply evenly - which isn&#x27;t too hard considering the foam is white, and it&#x27;s easy to see what you&#x27;ve missed.&lt;br /&gt;-Wait 10 hours or so before using a shower&lt;br /&gt;-Apply slightly less to areas with a lot of hair as the product can get stuck in hair and make that area slightly darker.</li>
    <li> Its good, it works. The colour shows up a couple hrs later, so it works fast. Only issue is that its kinda streaky. I do my best to rub it in evenly, but it still comes out blotchy.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin and it just made my skin look dirty brown.  Much too dark for me.</li>
    <li> Does the job when the sun isn&#x27;t around.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It evens the skin naturally and beautifully :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time.  It&#x27;s very quick drying and does not have a bad smell like alot of sunless tanners.  I&#x27;m pretty fair and the color is very natural.  I use the foam for upper body and the daily moisturizer for legs.  Great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a week and I&#x27;m not any tanner than I was before.</li>
    <li> This product purports to give you a natural tan that appears gradually.  I applied this stuff yesterday and now I am streaky and orange.  Not an attractive look.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff.  It doesnt get very dark, so im going to try to get the medium to dark next time, but it doesnt break me out and gives me a natural \\&quot;look alive\\&quot; glow- vs. the white pale dead look I usually sport.  Im literally told I have a healthy glow to me after I put it on and its very natural, not orange.  Plus the BF says its smells good.  Neutragena spray is also good but stinks.</li>
    <li> product is good but I ordered the wrong thing... but that my fault, will order again in the future, when I have used up what I have</li>
    <li> This is defiantly my favorite formula! Easy application and no freakishly orange Oompa Loompa tan :] (I am very fair skinned).&lt;br /&gt;-Erin</li>
