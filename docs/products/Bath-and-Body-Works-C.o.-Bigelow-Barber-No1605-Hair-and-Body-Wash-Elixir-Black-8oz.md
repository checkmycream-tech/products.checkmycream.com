      <li>A great gift for Christmas, birthday or Father&#x27;s Day.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>All-in-one products are very handy, and this one smells great.</li>
      <li>my girlfriend says i smell like a man (in a good way)</li>
      <li>and it does as good a job as anything else as a soap.  </li>
      <li>Very satisfied with price.</li>
      <li>Great smooth feeling ...</li>
      <li>I have loved this product and fragrance for many years</li>
      <li>We both agree that it&#x27;s a nice &#x27;manly scent&#x27; as he refuses to use fruity things.</li>
      <li>All I know is it&#x27;s either dumping out a lot more soap than before (the hole)</li>
      <li>All the girls love it.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>You will love this soap so will your woman.</li>
      <li>Just a nice clean manly smell.</li>
      <li>Smells good, and got here fast.</li>
      <li>and I have to say that i like the black the best</li>
      <li>However, upon ordering this thinking it&#x27;d be a bit more of a sophisticated scent, I found it really resembles stuff like Axe Phoenix.</li>
      <li>rich foam ... but</li>
      <li>Overall, Bath &amp; Body Works products are pretty cheap; I&#x27;m going to stick with the hair &amp; body washes from The Body Shop, which are always of superior quality.</li>
      <li>This is such a great body wash for a real man.</li>
      <li>It smells good and isn&#x27;t  overpowering, and won&#x27;t hang around for too long after you&#x27;re done bathing.</li>
      <li>, blue is pretty good too.</li>
      <li>My favorite body wash by far.</li>
      <li>Better the then musk at body shop by far.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and liked it, quite a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to buy it in bulk when it&#x27;s on sale (usually 10 or so) and that lasts me upwards of a year.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used CO Bigelow&#x27;s green and really enjoyed it as it was very unique in it&#x27;s scent.</li>
      <li>Simply amazing, I love the scent and just the mellow and subtle aroma it leaves on your skin.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>The package appeared to have more than adequate packing material but the top was not adequately snapped down.</li>
      <li>looked all over to find it, and luckily I found it on Amazon, where I usually find most of what I&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
      <li>more then any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Either way I&#x27;m less than pleased about it.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>This soap is one of my favorties not only doe this soap leave you fresh</li>
      <li>double the price, right?</li>
      <li>I love this stuff because I&#x27;m lazy</li>
      <li>With that, if I use half as much soap it&#x27;s almost worth</li>
      <li>Fresh and clean smelling, just a little goes a long way since it is so concentrated.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to tell for sure which.  </li>
      <li>like I used to, have to order it online apparently.</li>

    <li> I love this stuff because I&#x27;m lazy and I don&#x27;t want to have six bottles of goop in my shower. It smells good and isn&#x27;t  overpowering, and won&#x27;t hang around for too long after you&#x27;re done bathing. Can&#x27;t buy it at B&amp;BW like I used to, have to order it online apparently.</li>
    <li> All-in-one products are very handy, and this one smells great. It dries my skin after using, however, and it&#x27;s not even winter yet. Overall, Bath &amp; Body Works products are pretty cheap; I&#x27;m going to stick with the hair &amp; body washes from The Body Shop, which are always of superior quality.</li>
    <li> Great smooth feeling ... rich foam ... but pricey item</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used CO Bigelow&#x27;s green and really enjoyed it as it was very unique in it&#x27;s scent. However, upon ordering this thinking it&#x27;d be a bit more of a sophisticated scent, I found it really resembles stuff like Axe Phoenix. I couldn&#x27;t personally tell the two apart in a blind test (maybe someone with a more refined nose could.) There may be a few finer notes of difference, but I can&#x27;t tell. However, the selling point I have with this is that it is extremely latherable. I&#x27;d say 2x more then any other product I&#x27;ve tried. With that, if I use half as much soap it&#x27;s almost worth double the price, right?</li>
    <li> I have loved this product and fragrance for many years but I was disappointed that one of the tubes was not secured properly and had lost about half its contents during shipping.  What a mess.  The package appeared to have more than adequate packing material but the top was not adequately snapped down.</li>
    <li> Fresh and clean smelling, just a little goes a long way since it is so concentrated.  Great for travel as it can be used on hair and body.</li>
    <li> The best smelling shampoo around. All the girls love it. No joke.</li>
    <li> Best Body wash period.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift a few years ago and finally used it, and found it to be terrific on both my hair and as a body wash.&lt;br /&gt;I looked all over to find it, and luckily I found it on Amazon, where I usually find most of what I&#x27;m looking for.  Great product for men.</li>
    <li> This soap is one of my favorties not only doe this soap leave you fresh it is great for hair and face. You will love this soap so will your woman. Highly recommended. Better the then musk at body shop by far.</li>
    <li> Only hair and body wash I always use. Great product.</li>
    <li> Simply amazing, I love the scent and just the mellow and subtle aroma it leaves on your skin. It&#x27;s basically the opposite of AXE; and trust me, you want to be the opposite of AXE.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered. Very satisfied with price.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves the aroma and it lathers up well.  I use an equivalent as if toothpaste and do hair, face (shave), body (including back brush) all in one swoop during my morning shower.  Throw in a hair conditioner a couple times a week...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and liked it, quite a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to buy it in bulk when it&#x27;s on sale (usually 10 or so) and that lasts me upwards of a year.  I hate shopping at the Mall so finding the sale and purchasing online is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But recent purchases are starting to make me wonder if they&#x27;re either changed the formula to make it runnier, or if changed the size of the opening in the lid.  The product doesn&#x27;t seem to last anywhere near as long as it had in the past.  It&#x27;s hard to tell for sure which.  All I know is it&#x27;s either dumping out a lot more soap than before (the hole) or they&#x27;ve thinned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way I&#x27;m less than pleased about it.  I still like the smell and it does as good a job as anything else as a soap.  But not when I&#x27;m paying this price and starting to feel like I&#x27;m getting less for the money.  So be mindful of games they play with packaging.</li>
    <li> Smells good, and got here fast. That&#x27;s about all I have to say! This stuff is hard to find in stores now.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m on my third bottle of this stuff and I have to say that i like the black the best, blue is pretty good too. my girlfriend says i smell like a man (in a good way) when I use it to wash up, i keep one at the gym so i come home smelling great</li>
    <li> This is such a great body wash for a real man. None of the crazy scents we see from other body washes. Just a nice clean manly smell. I love it.</li>
    <li> My favorite body wash by far.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  My husband loves it.  Would recommend to all. A great gift for Christmas, birthday or Father&#x27;s Day.</li>
    <li> He Bics his head so I can&#x27;t speak to the shampoo aspect of this. We both agree that it&#x27;s a nice &#x27;manly scent&#x27; as he refuses to use fruity things. I&#x27;ve used it myself and it actually leaves a bit of the fragrance on my skin for an hour or so after a shower.</li>
