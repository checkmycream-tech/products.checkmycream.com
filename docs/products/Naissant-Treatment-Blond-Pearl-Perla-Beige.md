      <li>the longer you leave it on the better</li>
      <li>So glad I bought this.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love.  </li>
      <li>After using both the shampoo and treatment my hair is the PERFECT blonde!!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t get any hair dresser to lift it more for fear of fryng.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hooked :)</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m ok with it</li>
      <li>This does not tone and the smell is overwhelming</li>
      <li>As a toner it seems ok</li>
      <li>Gets the orangy tones out and brightens and refreshes my blonde perfectly.</li>
      <li>and i love it</li>
      <li>I love the Naissant perla beige treatment.  </li>
      <li>I used it every couple of days and love the results</li>
      <li>Great product so far, and</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
      <li>It keeps all brass out of my hair, smells wonderful, and a lot less than Aveda.</li>
      <li>Great for enhancing my blonde highlights - I use it once a week</li>
      <li>, so i enjoy that as well.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried all the ones available in the U.S.  Control the intensity levels by the amount of time you leave the product in.</li>
      <li>It smells great &amp; brightens my blonde.</li>
      <li>Fantastic colour payoff.</li>
      <li>whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;After just ONE use of this product, my hair is a nice beige blonde and the lowlights are a nice tone as well!&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>I have tried many purple hair products and this is right up there.</li>
      <li>It also brightens my blonde highlights very nicely.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft and shiny, love it!</li>
      <li>At first I thought it turned my hair purple, but after I dried it it was the perfect color.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised how effective this product is.</li>
      <li>This brand is the best..removes brassy warm tones and doesn&#x27;t dry out hair like most purple shampoos.</li>
      <li>I used this for the first time today and so far I love it!</li>
      <li>I honestly thought I purchased the shampoo version of this and realized, once in the shower, it was the actual toner.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think this is a good product to use in between your color (particularly if your hair is super blonde) or if you need, like me, to knock out brassy tones.</li>
      <li>It takes quite a bit  to work thru hair ...but its definitly worth it.</li>
      <li>So I ordered it, right away I saw results.</li>
      <li>I use this right along with the Shampoo..</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t really think there is anything special about it to justify the price.</li>
      <li>and it really works!</li>
      <li>When used along with the Naissant Shampoo Blond Pearl - Perla Beige, my mousy brown roots lighten up enough to prolong touching up my roots.  </li>
      <li>So much better than the what you can buy from your local Ulta or drugstore.</li>
      <li>Despite it not toning my hair to the colors I&#x27;d hoped, I still give it 4 stars because of how well it really works!</li>
      <li>I am so impressed, and I&#x27;m not easily impressed, trust me.</li>
      <li>This treatment is rich and leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
      <li>It works amazingly, I have black hair on top and blonde on the bottom</li>
      <li>I took a chance with the positive reviews.</li>
      <li>I saw how amazing all the reviews were on this product and decided to give it a shot, and it took the yellow completely out and left me with the beautiful ash/almost white blonde that I wanted.</li>
      <li>I tried it after seeing multiple youtubers preach that its awesome, but im always skeptical of their reviews as most of them are just trying to push products in a young girls face.  </li>
      <li>left it very smooth and soft as a bonus!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad because my hair was very dry from lifting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Pricey, since I really try and coat my hair (</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>And the price is so much lower than some stuff out there that compete with this product.</li>
      <li>I have a light ash brown balayage with ash blonde highlights thru out</li>
      <li>and it takes all the extra coloring out and makes it a nice platinum blonde again</li>
      <li>so I was searching for something that kept the brassiness out and kept the blonde light and vibrant.</li>
      <li>It looks great on fresh and tired blonde hair but don&#x27;t use it too often or your hair will start to look grayish!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other similar products and this shampoo &amp; treatment has worked the best for my blonde!</li>
      <li>I previously used Shimmer Lights and I&#x27;ve found this brand works a bit better and is not as drying to my hair.  </li>
      <li>It definitely tones, if you are looking to be more beige blonde.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for getting the &amp;#34;brass&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND, you&#x27;ll never have to go to your stylist for toning treatments ever again.</li>
      <li>Instead of refreshing my hair it stained my hair blue grey.</li>
      <li>If you are going for a dull blonde look with gray tint, this would be good for you.</li>
      <li>I leave it in for about 5 minutes or more, but never more than 10, then rinse.</li>
      <li>This stuff is literally a miracle worker, I have ombré hair and the blonde part was VERY yellow to the point that I thought I was gonna have to bleach my hair for a third time to get the color I wanted, but my hair is very fine and thin and wouldn&#x27;t be able to handle that.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of natural gold tones in my hair so it gets brassy.</li>
      <li>I have tried different purple shampoos and never really saw much of a difference, this stuff really tones your hair.  </li>
      <li>This really doesn&#x27;t condition my hair at all, and even leaves it feeling dry.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use this and update my review once I give it a few more tries.</li>
      <li>I find besides for the purple toning my hair color, it allows for random shades of blonde streaks giving my hair that nice blonde mix--swirl of colors, and leaves my hair nourished and hydrated--which is much needed after stripping color from your hair.</li>
      <li>While taking the brass out of my hair and lightening the blonde , it also made it really soft</li>
      <li>I have dry curly locks which recently I bleached and this really gave me moisture while I was washing it out.</li>
      <li>the natural white hair has definitely taken on a purple color.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used this for the first time today and so far I love it! My hair was so soft and it definitely toned out some of the yellow in my hair. I will probably buy the shampoo to go along with it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is literally a miracle worker, I have ombré hair and the blonde part was VERY yellow to the point that I thought I was gonna have to bleach my hair for a third time to get the color I wanted, but my hair is very fine and thin and wouldn&#x27;t be able to handle that.

At first I thought it turned my hair purple, but after I dried it it was the perfect color. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND, you&#x27;ll never have to go to your stylist for toning treatments ever again.</li>
    <li> It works amazingly, I have black hair on top and blonde on the bottom so sometimes when I wash it the black color leaks into the bottom and makes the blonde a grayish color, so I put this stuff on my hair when it&#x27;s dry, leave it on for about 20 min and it takes all the extra coloring out and makes it a nice platinum blonde again but if I leave it in too long it turns a purpleish color, which I like so I&#x27;m ok with it lol I love this stuff, I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone :)</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product! It keeps all brass out of my hair, smells wonderful, and a lot less than Aveda. I have officially switched!</li>
    <li> I use this once a week and it really works!</li>
    <li> Great product so far, and I&#x27;ve only had to use it twice. Gets the orangy tones out and brightens and refreshes my blonde perfectly.</li>
    <li> I cannot rave about this purple hair treatment enough. I have ordered it at least 7 times in the last 10 months. I lighten my hair with over the counter blonde hair dye (I&#x27;m a natural dirty blonde) after each dye, my hair has a slight orange tinge that I HATE. I was was recommended this purple hair treatment by a random online post I was reading. So I ordered it, right away I saw results. You can leave it on for a few minutes or for 20 minutes. Either way, you see results. I find besides for the purple toning my hair color, it allows for random shades of blonde streaks giving my hair that nice blonde mix--swirl of colors, and leaves my hair nourished and hydrated--which is much needed after stripping color from your hair. Plus! Now it comes in a larger size! All in all, I&#x27;d say give it a try. I love it!!</li>
    <li> I have a dark blonde ombre going for me at the moment. I&#x27;m prone to brassiness so I was looking for something to freshen up my look and ended up purchasing Naissant. The liquid is very thin, purple, and smells faintly of dye. That&#x27;s basically what it is after all, dye. It can be a bit messy if you&#x27;re not careful. But, I can see an improvement after using this product. I didn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; moment afterwards but I was still happy with the result. I think this is a good product to use in between your color (particularly if your hair is super blonde) or if you need, like me, to knock out brassy tones. I leave it in for about 5 minutes or more, but never more than 10, then rinse. It does dry out my ends but a deep conditioner eradicates that problem.</li>
    <li> Best toning treatment on the market and I&#x27;ve tried all the ones available in the U.S.  Control the intensity levels by the amount of time you leave the product in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised how effective this product is. I used it just once and it turned my brassy highlights into platinum highlights. I find I can use it once a week or less and it lasts (I wash my hair every day)</li>
    <li> Totally love this! It tones down brassiness, and doesn&#x27;t stain bleached strands purple unless you overdo it. I have tried many brands in an effort to  accomplish these results--this is the best.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  When used along with the Naissant Shampoo Blond Pearl - Perla Beige, my mousy brown roots lighten up enough to prolong touching up my roots.  Will continue to use on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> This brand is the best..removes brassy warm tones and doesn&#x27;t dry out hair like most purple shampoos. This is my favorite shampoo now, buy it if you have platinum hair!</li>
    <li> I love the Naissant perla beige treatment.  I previously used Shimmer Lights and I&#x27;ve found this brand works a bit better and is not as drying to my hair.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I use this right along with the Shampoo.. the longer you leave it on the better it works for me..and be sure to work it in good.. As a hairdresser.. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> A must have product for blondes who suffer from brassy tones!</li>
    <li> Seems to work on my hair.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft and shiny, love it!</li>
    <li> Did not work for me.  I am growing out white hair from previous colored blonde hair and the treated hair has turned a too yellow blonde.  I used this product thinking I could tone down the yellow in the treated hair, but that did not work.  Used product twice and now the blonde has not changed but the natural white hair has definitely taken on a purple color.  Not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Loved this product! It looks great on fresh and tired blonde hair but don&#x27;t use it too often or your hair will start to look grayish!</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner! I wish they would make a deep masque with purple tone.</li>
    <li> The Wife:&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing! I honestly thought I purchased the shampoo version of this and realized, once in the shower, it was the actual toner.&lt;br /&gt;I found a review of it through a youtube channel video and my hair was seriously brassy with both gold and orange tones after stripping it with bleach to remove 5BR from my hair to go back to my natural color, which turns blonde in the Summer from the Sun.&lt;br /&gt;I thought there was NO HOPE whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;After just ONE use of this product, my hair is a nice beige blonde and the lowlights are a nice tone as well!&lt;br /&gt;It left it very smooth and soft as a bonus! I&#x27;m glad because my hair was very dry from lifting.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to just leave my hair alone for a bit and use essential oils to get it back to a regular PH and strengthen.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other similar products and this shampoo &amp; treatment has worked the best for my blonde! I had naturally black hair and have bleached it so I was searching for something that kept the brassiness out and kept the blonde light and vibrant. This shampoo did it for me and I follow up with the Blond Pearl Treatment to help condition any damages from the bleaching.</li>
    <li> Definitely tones my hair. I find this stuff really effective. I leave it in for 15-20 minutes once a week..does the trick.  My hair is medium blonde.  Pricey, since I really try and coat my hair (shoulder length bob) so only last 5-6 uses. Lost a star for price, otherwise great product!</li>
    <li> The perfect pair for the Naissant purple shampoo. I can&#x27;t go without it. It completes the look. After using both the shampoo and treatment my hair is the PERFECT blonde!! I will never be without!! 💗</li>
    <li> It turns your blonde hair gray and gives it a dull finish( I tried both shampoo and conditioner, actually bought too much now I have 4 bottles left that I can&#x27;t do anything with). I&#x27;m not a fan. If you are going for a dull blonde look with gray tint, this would be good for you.</li>
    <li> I use this along with the shampoo. This is nice to use and gives good results. It smells great &amp; brightens my blonde. It does do what is says but I don&#x27;t really think there is anything special about it to justify the price. The previous purple shampoo that I have used prior does the same thing for less than half the price. I will finish the bottle but probably would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Despite it not toning my hair to the colors I&#x27;d hoped, I still give it 4 stars because of how well it really works! It definitely tones, if you are looking to be more beige blonde.</li>
    <li> Wanted to try this after all the hype, but of course it did not work for me. I have brassy tones in my hair that I wanted to tone between color sessions. Instead of refreshing my hair it stained my hair blue grey. I am so upset. To reverse my smurf hair I had to wash with dawn dishsoap. So disappointed.</li>
    <li> It definitely is something that i would repurchase. While taking the brass out of my hair and lightening the blonde , it also made it really soft and i love it</li>
    <li> Best purple conditioner !!!! I&#x27;m hooked :)</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Highly recommend for getting the &amp;#34;brass&amp;#34; out of your blonde!&lt;br /&gt;Ps.  Don&#x27;t leave it in too long or you&#x27;ll turn grayish/violet!</li>
    <li> Fantastic colour payoff. So glad I bought this. I mix it with my favourite conditioning treatments. Works like a charm. I have tried many purple hair products and this is right up there. Very dark purple. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This really doesn&#x27;t condition my hair at all, and even leaves it feeling dry. As a toner it seems ok but I only am using it for highlights. I actually meant to order the shampoo but I guess I make a mistake so I thought I would just try it out anyway. I think I am returning it.</li>
    <li> This does not tone and the smell is overwhelming</li>
    <li> Great for getting out the *Brassy*!</li>
    <li> Great for enhancing my blonde highlights - I use it once a week so it lasts a long time</li>
    <li> Amazing!! I have a light ash brown balayage with ash blonde highlights thru out and this product definitely helped remove the brassy orange/yellow tones!</li>
    <li> I loved this treatment more then it&#x27;s shampoo. I have dry curly locks which recently I bleached and this really gave me moisture while I was washing it out. The smell does not bother me like other reviews I&#x27;ve read. I will continue to use this and update my review once I give it a few more tries.</li>
    <li> Worked great. So much better than the what you can buy from your local Ulta or drugstore. It takes quite a bit  to work thru hair ...but its definitly worth it. Gave some to my mom and she loved it. Will order again!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of natural gold tones in my hair so it gets brassy. I can&#x27;t get any hair dresser to lift it more for fear of fryng.  This treatment in addition to the shampoo not only got rid of the brassiness, it seemed to lift my blonde to lighter levels.  I am sold.  I will continue to use these products. Love, love, love.  Also delivery was days before expected.  Good job.</li>
    <li> I love this the shampoo for keeping my expensive highlites ashy. I used it every couple of days and love the results</li>
    <li> This treatment is rich and leaves my hair feeling soft. It also brightens my blonde highlights very nicely. I use it once or twice per week with the blonde pearl shampoo. I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> This works so well! It moisturizes, tones my hair, it&#x27;s so good! I&#x27;m so happy that I ran into this! And the price is so much lower than some stuff out there that compete with this product. I am so impressed, and I&#x27;m not easily impressed, trust me. Highly recommended for people looking for the best toning product for silver/blonde hair.</li>
    <li> I did not want to give it any stars at all. I took a chance with the positive reviews. My hair ended up with dull gray strands &amp; stained purple/lavender. I had to go to a salon to get my hair cleaned &amp; clarified to take the stain off. I&#x27;m sending it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> This purple treatment is FO REALS.  Just dont leave on too long or it will give your hair a silvery purple tint.  I have tried different purple shampoos and never really saw much of a difference, this stuff really tones your hair.  As long as im blonde bombshelling it out, i will keep this product in my shower.  I tried it after seeing multiple youtubers preach that its awesome, but im always skeptical of their reviews as most of them are just trying to push products in a young girls face.  And its not a million dollars, so i enjoy that as well.</li>
