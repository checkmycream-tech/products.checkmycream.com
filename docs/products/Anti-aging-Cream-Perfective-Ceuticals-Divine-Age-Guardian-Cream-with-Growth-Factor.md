      <li>It has a distinct feminine smell to it, which isn&#x27;t so good if you&#x27;re a man like me :-)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using the Perfective Ceuticals anti-aging line over the past month and I have noticed that some of the puffiness and very fine lines have relaxed a bit.  Simply put, this cream goes on lightly and leaves a pleasant scent and seems to help mellow some of the effects of the daily assaults to skin.  It doesn&#x27;t clog pores and a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m often told I look younger than my age (recently by my Dermatologist and by another one of my doctors) and I think a product like this can help keep that young look going.  I&#x27;ve used the line for about 1 month most days and I like the combo of the serum and the Divine Age Guardian Cream with G/F.  Nice product that just seems to work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tried this type of product before or anything like it.  In fact I don&#x27;t even wear makeup.  I didn&#x27;t have any preconceived notions or expectations of Perfective Ceutical products whatsoever.  I&#x27;m not particularly gullible and have to try something and thoroughly test a product before passing judgement.  Now you can simply called me very pleasantly surprised.  Mind you, if you have deep wrinkles, perhaps you&#x27;d better pass on this one.  If you have those crows feet and laugh lines that come with age, this is a product that you may wish to add to your wish list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my late fifties and definitely am showing signs of wear and tear.  I do like the natural aging process and dislike the look of people who have had face lifts.  Frankly I think some of them of look as if they are going to pop.  Now, what does this actually do?  I&#x27;ve been using the Perfective Ceuticals products for about a month.  I diligently applied a small amount as directed twice a day.  There was a light, but almost imperceptible greasy look to the \\&quot;Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy.\\&quot;  The other two products didn&#x27;t have that, but left a greasy film on my hands.  This washed off readily with soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days I actually noticed a difference.  What was happening was that the crows feet and small wrinkles were what I would call \\&quot;softening.\\&quot;  It definitely was noticeable and I actually thought I looked younger.  Perhaps I was deluding myself, but if I felt better about how I looked, that&#x27;s all that counts.  Of course if you use one of those magnifying mirrors you&#x27;ll notice every little wrinkle, but peering into a regular bathroom mirror it was as if I&#x27;d used some sort of concealer.  No, it&#x27;s not going to work on the deep lines beside your mouth, but softens the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no need to slather on this product as a little dab will do it as they say.  When you use the \\&quot;Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy,\\&quot; make sure you use a flattened \\&quot;pea-sized\\&quot; amount because if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;ll run out quickly.  All in all, I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the Perfective Ceutical products.  Actually, I&#x27;m very impressed they worked at all as my expectations were low to nonexistent.  Yes, this product does work.  If you expect that all your wrinkles will be totally erased, you need to look elsewhere.  The intent of Perfective Ceuticals is, I believe, to lessen or soften those light wrinkles you already have.  If you can settle for that, you&#x27;ll be happy.  I&#x27;ve done a bit of research on the ingredients.  The only iffy one, of course is the EGF.  Personally, I think this company did their homework.  The only drawback that I can see is the expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS ... what are these?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua), , Triethylhexanoin, Olive Squalane, Emu Oil, Dimethicone, Glycerin, 1-Butylene Glycol, 3-Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone/Copolyol Crosspolymer, Matrixyl (Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4), Polyquaternium-51, Raffinose, Beefsteak Extract, Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Ginseng Extract, Licorice Extract, Lactic Acid, Hydroxyproline, Vitamin E Acetate, Retinol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~  Cyclopentasiloxane: Otherwise known as D5;  it is an emollient.

    <li> I bought this cream since my favorite face cream has been discontinued. This cream does exactly what it says at a reasonable price. Even though it has a texture slightly richer, it is easily absorbed and gives my dry skin a more \\&quot;plumped up\\&quot; look. I would suggest using this cream in between neck and breast as well.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of different skin creams because I am sensitive to strongly perfumed cosmetics.  As soon as I opened this cream I was relieved - the rose scent is light and sweet and a little old fashioned.  The cream, however, is really rich.  It goes on nicely and feels really good.  It has only been a few days so I can&#x27;t say I see any differences, but I sure can feel them.  No more dryness, no more flaking, and no more itchiness.  In winter here in the northeast, that&#x27;s saying something!</li>
    <li> I started buying this in 2011.  I have used it for 5 years.  Helped my skin a lot!  A miracle cream.  Now I use something else that actually erases wrinkles because it grows new cells and creates a truly youthful face!  But this product was my first introduction into a skin facial product that does what it says it will do.  I swore by it for 5 years, and since it doesn&#x27;t take much, this jar will last you three months, easily.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Sorry, but I was simply not impressed. The design is lovely, the price is not, and I gave it to one of my daughters-in-law to try. She has dry skin on her legs. She diligently applied the Perfective Ceuticals cream to one leg, and a very inexpensive honey cream to the other. After a couple of weeks, she told me that the honey cream was MUCH better than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was quite a revelation, given all of the positive reviews on the Perfective Ceuticals cream. Hence, we cannot recommend it, nor will we be purchasing it again. Our wallets and our skin, will thank us!</li>
    <li> OVERVIEW:  I&#x27;d been trying different age prevention products for years (since I&#x27;m over 50 now) -- each time new \\&quot;research\\&quot; uncovered the latest miracle cream or a friend raved about how \\&quot;this really works,\\&quot; I gave it a try.  Half-empty bottles lined my shelves.  Rarely did I re-order as I wanted to try something new.  Not any more.  Those half-empty bottles have now been thrown away.  Every since I&#x27;ve been using the Perfective Ceuticals line, I am not open to trying anything else; there&#x27;s no reason to.  I use the Anti-Impefection Eye Therapy, Divine Age Guardian Cream and Divine Age Guardian Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIVINE AGE GUARDIAN CREAM:  This review is about the Divine Age Guardian Cream.  I tend to have oily skin so shy away from any type of creams because of break-outs or greasiness.  This is the first cream I have used that deeply moisturizes my skin but does not leave it feeling oily.  I use the Age Guardian Cream before bed.  I actually look forward to this last step of my skin care regimen each night because it makes my skin feel so smooth and hydrated.  In the morning,  I wake up still feeling moisturized but not the least bit oily.  I truly love this product.</li>
    <li> For the price, this product simply doesn&#x27;t offer that much value.  I think a lot of the other reviewers must be family members or employees or something.  Although the scent is fine, I find the cream greasy, and I prefer Olay&#x27;s Regenerist because my skin only feels just like skin immediately after application.  I&#x27;m 49 and don&#x27;t yet have extensive wrinkles or anything, but I was looking for more results in skin quality and smoothness from this cream than it provides.</li>
    <li> This is going to be a bit of an usual review, I bet. I bought this cream for my wife. She&#x27;s hitting 45 in December and had, in my opinion, been noticing things that aren&#x27;t there. It started in June and she would stare in the mirror and become critical. She&#x27;d ask me whether I noticed the latest wrinkle and honestly? I never saw the first one, so I wasn&#x27;t sure how to answer. It&#x27;s a tough position for a husband because I don&#x27;t want her to think she&#x27;s crazy, but none of that is really important to me. I love her and I think she&#x27;s as beautiful as the day I met her almost 16 years ago. But bear in mind that I am a man; we&#x27;re kind of clueless in these areas. However, to make her feel better, I asked some of her friends and my sisters what I could do to make her feel better. Two of them recommended this cream. I know my wife is really into natural things and doesn&#x27;t even wear make up, so I had to be careful with anything I was going to give her. It had to contain natural ingredients and not have her feeling like she was wearing a cosmetic. This was a lot to ask of something that calls itself an anti-aging cream.   Well something really strange happened. Even though I had never noticed anything different about her face and had seriously wondered whether she was seeing stuff that just didn&#x27;t exist, her complexion looks so much smoother and finer than it did before. It&#x27;s not something I can put into words. I still can&#x27;t see any wrinkles; I never did, but she looks more, and I am not sure what the word is, brighter and cheerier than she did before she began using this Perfective Ceuticals stuff. I even took out a photo of her from a year ago and she looks better. Her face isn&#x27;t puffy any more and her skin is smoother. I can&#x27;t exactly explain it, but whatever it is, I notice a difference and so does she, which really is all that matters. I have always told her, if she&#x27;s happy than I am happy.</li>
    <li> This is basically the only stuff I can use as a shield during the dry, winter months!   The biggest change after using this lotion: my skin tone has evened out and yes, I see a difference with fewer fine lines around my eyes and mouth. However, the deepest lines on my forehead are still relatively visible, as expected, but nothing short of a face-lift or botox is gonna get those nasty little suckers out!  I&#x27;ve even been sparingly applying some of this lotion on some dry spots like my hands and elbows! Absolutely awesome, awesome, awesome!</li>
    <li> Was excited to try this product. I am a beauty  junkie and have tried all of the expensive high end department store brands such as La Mer and La Prairie to name a few. This highly hydrating cream comes beautifully packaged in a unique rounded jar. When I applied the cream I immediately felt the hydration. I live in the desert so moisture is always a problem for me. Even after 30 minutes I noticed my skin still felt and looked dewey. I thought it looked plump after the first application. My wrinkles and lines seemed to be less noticeable. Well, after just 2weeks of use my girlfriends started to notice something &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; thinking I had Botox or something to look fresh and not so tired. I have perfective ceudicals to thank. I feel and looks 5 years younger. Will def reorder and continue to use.</li>
    <li> I was looking to splurge on a new face cream and saw that this one had been reduced a little, so i went for it. Love it! The first thing I noticed when I got it was the cool, spherical jar. When I opened it, it smelled like flowers. It&#x27;s a gorgeious smell. I put it on before bed and my skin felt so good almost immediately. I actually felt a little firmer, even that skin under my chin. When I woke up the next morning, my skin was so soft. It is an excellent moisturizer and I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does to my skin over the next few weeks.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1JPRECX4NX44Z]]This video review is for [[ASIN:B0030DE8F2 Anti-aging Eye Cream for Wrinkles and Puffiness Under Eyes - Perfective Ceuticals Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy Cream with Growth Factor]], [[ASIN:B0030DK7E8 Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) Skin Care - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor]] and [[ASIN:B004B9C8MO Anti-aging Cream with Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and Peptides - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Cream with Growth Factor]]. I have taken some before and after photos and put them in the video.     My skin type is dry, sensitive and sun-damaged so I was hoping the products could help my discoloration and fine lines in some way.     My experience with Divine Age Guardian Cream:    Day 1: Opened up the jar of cream today and I was greeted with a pleasant smell of crisp roses! After first application, my skin seems to be getting along with the lotion and my face looks a little more vibrant. Wait and see.....    Months 2-4: Okay, so things are looking pretty sweet so far! My wrinkles are microscopic now and my pores are noticeably smaller and lighter. My skin tone looked more even and radiant...    Months 5-8: Having a crummy time at work these past few months. Still keeping to my skin regimen though cause it&#x27;s the only thing that&#x27;s been working out perfectly so far this year in my life. I&#x27;m not getting as much improvement as I was before but what&#x27;s been done so far has been amazing. I look fresh, firm and fierce if I do say so myself! My skin texture has never been better and I go out most days without foundation.     The texture of this face cream is intensely rich and fairly sticky after application but as long as it works, who cares? I am very pleased with the results so far and I don&#x27;t even use foundation any more.</li>
    <li> I am a sucker for skin products, especially night creams.  Since I use to be a sun worshiper, I guess I am  trying to undue the damage to my skin.  Especially during these cold winter months, I use to go to bed with my skin feeling dry and irritated, no matter what moisturizer I used..  I would  subsequently wake up with the same dry, irritated skin even after a good night&#x27;s sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a Clinque user for years, as was my mother before me.  Recently, I even tried a few new creams from Estee Lauder until my dermatologist recommended Laura Mercier.  My skin certainly felt less dry, however, none of these products were a WOW factor.  When I tried Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Creme, I immediately felt a difference.  I use this product in the evening and you only need a small amount.  The cream has a light, floral smell, perhaps reminiscent of  rose petals.  My skin seemed to immediately feel smooth, hydrated and comfortable.  After a month of use I see and feel the cumulative results of this luxurious but not greasy cream.  My make-up goes on smoother and I now need to only use a few drops.  What this cream is doing under my skin I leave to the experts.  On the surface,  my skin tone is more even, the dry/tight look and feel is gone, as are the fine lines and wrinkles. I would recommend this cream to my 22 year old daughter and only wish it were available when I was that age.  A sample was provided for review. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love this cream and If someone said I could have a case of cream from all the kinds I have tried I would pick this cream hands down. The reason I would do that is because this one has Growth factor in it and that is way different than other creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Growth factor really transforms the look and feel of facial skin and makes even aging skin like mine look the best it can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Divine age Guardian cream will help boost the skins production of collagen and Elastin and prevents collagen from loosing its spring. For me this is a huge deal I am 54 and going to be 55 soon and let me tell you that you will see a difference with this cream very quickly</li>
    <li> This is a very nice product but it had one major downside for me: It has a distinct feminine smell to it, which isn&#x27;t so good if you&#x27;re a man like me :-) The first day that I put it on, my wife asked me why I smelled like a woman. I told her about this skin creme and her response was, \\&quot;You&#x27;ve got to try something else because I don&#x27;t want my husband smelling like my mother.\\&quot;  I&#x27;d love to continue using it, but there&#x27;s no way I can with feedback like that.  Even if you&#x27;re a woman, you should be aware that the scent lingers for hours after you&#x27;ve applied the product, so you really need to like the way it smells to use this over the long term.</li>
    <li> In my quest for the fountain of skin youth I have tried all sorts of different brands, day cream, night cream etc. The anti-aging cream from perfective Ceuticals truly is divine. It feels so luxurious and creamy as I&#x27;m applying it to my face and it lasts all day. After I use it at night I wake up actually feeling soft and dewy, like a soap opera star when they wake up looking good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any issues with my sensitive skin, no breakouts, redness, or rash. My skin feels smoother, even my husband noticed when he was rubbing my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there is a slight rosewater scent that is very pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sample provided</li>
    <li> Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Creme is a wonderful product. It makes my facial skin feel soft and gives it a nice glow. I could see the effects within about two weeks and it was noticeable to others as well. I highly recommend this creme which has Omega 3-6-9 along with peptides and epidermal growth factor in its ingredients to stimulate collagen regrowth. Try it. I must disclose that I was sent this cream as a gift from the manufacturers.</li>
    <li> What a great skin cream! Not only does the cream come in a gorgeous little sphere, it also makes your skin gorgeous. In just 4 days my skin is more soft, supple, and dewy. I&#x27;ve known for a while about the wonders of both Emu Oil, and Retinol A, but I&#x27;ve never used a product with them both in it. The cream has a great texture as well, not greasy. Love it. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Divine Age Guardian Cream with Growth Factor is a great product. Unlike some other facial creams that are light, making your face feeling dry only minutes later; this is an actual cream. It moisturizes your skin without an oily look or feeling. All you need is less than a dime size of cream to cover your entire face and neck each day which gives my skin an all day smooth feel and nice glow.</li>
    <li> It has really helped my skin stay nice and soft from this dry harsh winter. It is suppose to lift and tighten, and I really felt it do it’s job! Now that I’m in my thirties’ I am constantly on the look out for products with antioxidants and Omega 3′s in them and this one has them, plus more!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Cream from the company, free in exchange for writing an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to put this product aside for a few months, because it was too heavy for North Carolina summers.  Now that the weather has cooled down, I was able to give it a try.  I&#x27;m happy to say that it&#x27;s every bit as good as the rest of their product line!  I apply this cream to my clean face before bedtime, and wake up with radiant skin and fewer wrinkles every day.  It soaks into my skin quickly and leave it moist but not sticky, and the growth factor in it helps combat wrinkles and eye bags.  It&#x27;s amazing to me, after using many products to combat aging without success, that there&#x27;s actually something that does what it promises.  I&#x27;ve seen 10 years come off my face since I began using Perfective Ceuticals products! I will continue to use them as long as they make them.  They&#x27;re that good!</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved the face cream rich and luxurious as well as calming to skin Llowi g me to turn back time while relaxing.</li>
    <li> Disclosure-  I received this product as a review sample some time ago. I&#x27;d never used this type of product before and I was surprised- it feels really good on my face. After I&#x27;d been using it awhile, I noticed a difference: my skin got much smoother and the wrinkles seemed less noticeable. Mostly I love the texture of this product: it&#x27;s creamy and smooth but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended and I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I loved this cream. I was attracted to the fact that so many people were willing to swear by it. I thought &amp;#34;no way can this product live up to its reputation.&amp;#34; I got it when there was a sale--I&#x27;m 27 and am starting to see some wrinkles around the eyes and smile area. I am in a customer service environment and always make dramatic expressions, which are starting to be etched into my skin. I want to try to stave off aging for as long as I can, but I still break out if the product is oil at all. I absolutely love this product--it feels good going on and absorbs really well. I love the smell....the appearance and I love how current Perfective Ceuticals is with their research--I will continue to use!</li>
    <li> And it calms super-sensitive wind chapped faces!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really is amazing. Not only did it hydrate after a harsh winter, but I recently did a face peel. This is the only cream I could use after the peel.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, making it a good value despite high initial investment.&lt;br /&gt;Looks nice on the vanity as well!</li>
    <li> Not really but the fact is that, after her first couple of months with this product, my wife is going to order more because she&#x27;s hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We received a free &#x27;for review&#x27; box of [[ASIN:B004B9C8MO Anti-aging Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Cream with Growth Factor]] from the Perfective Ceuticals people together with the [[ASIN:B0030DK7E8 Anti-aging Serum - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor]] and the [[ASIN:B00AYARK2C Anti-aging Eye Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy Cream with Growth Factor]] which together make up the complete anti-aging solution. They suggested that we review the product whenever ready, hopefully after a few months of use so the results would be apparent. So... a few months have passed and the results actually were apparent after about 10 days. Not that I noticed because my wife could not possibly look any more beautiful than she does, but... you know, that&#x27;s what she said :). She is extremely happy with it and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some advice: follow the use instructions from Amazon&#x27;s site to the letter and you will be happy. Remember that The right order to apply the products, if you have them all would be: Serum &gt; Eye Cream &gt; Face Cream. Face cream should always be last because it locks in the other two. They recommend 2 applications daily but Ms. D only applied them once per day at night and she noticed results after only a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one little note: be aware that anyone who is allergic to Retinol (Vitamin A) should not use this products.</li>
    <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and have very dry and fairly sensitive skin (menopause).  Winters in New England don&#x27;t help either and the over the past five years I&#x27;ve felt like the skin on my face is not my own (creepy!). The Gaurdian Cream is just what I need to thoroughly moisturize and calm down that dry skin feeling.  The cream has a light scent of rose petals and the texture is luxurious (as is the packaging).  It goes on nicely and takes about 5 minutes to fully absorb into clean skin.  My face feels fresh and doesn&#x27;t feel or look dry anymore.  I just looks healthy!  I do use the cream over the serum, which by the way, really tones and tightens the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many high and low end day and night creams only to return or toss. The Guardian Cream is a keeper!</li>
    <li> I just recently started using this product and cannot honestly give an assessment as to whether it works or not but will write a review in the future as time goes by and as I see results or no results.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing!  I had been using it for a couple of weeks when I went to a retirement workshop.  The instructor looked at me and said that I needed to have 25 years of service to even think about retiring.  When I told him that I had over 30 years of service, he said that he thought I WAS 30!  It was worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> This Anti-aging cream is just that....nice and creamy.  It feels rich and smooth.  My skin feels like it instantly drinks up the cream when applied.  And, you need just a small amount.  When you apply you do so in upward circular motions to help stimulate your skin and get the cream where it needs to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this has been one of the top anti-aging creams I have used on my face to date.  After 1 day I felt my face felt better.  After a week it feels really soft and silky, and I have noticed a difference in how my skin looks--tighter--firmer--a few less wrinkles.  Can&#x27;t wait to finish the product and see how my face looks then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside is strong smell of either rose or else the musky type smell from the emu oil.  Other than that, this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to read my full review here. [...]</li>
    <li> Absorbs into the skin really well and makes your face feel smooth.</li>
    <li> I received the cream free to try and provide an honest opinion. Here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent and feel of this cream. It&#x27;s slightly thick, but rubs easily and it&#x27;s not sticky at all. As usual, every time I try a new product I get small bumps on my face the first one or two days and it goes away, unfortunately the little bumps did not go away. My face did not itch, so I didn&#x27;t feel as if I had an allergic reaction to the cream and I continued using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smile lines around my mouth are really faint. They are still there, but only I notice them, I pointed it out to a friend who said I&#x27;m imaging things, lol. Since I didn&#x27;t have wrinkles, I can&#x27;t really comment on those changes, but in the three weeks that I have been using this, my complexion is noticeably more toned and my Homer Simpson mouth discoloration has faded a bit. I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I felt compelled to come back and write a review because I&#x27;m 54 and I&#x27;ve been carded twice this week!!  Once at the market and once at Trader Joe&#x27;s (also a market). I was wearing sun glasses, but still!! I bought the Clarisonic Mia face cleansing gadget and was using it for about a month when I came across the reviews for Perfective Ceuticals. I had noticed my skin looking a little firmer,the brows were lifted a little and I had less of a tired look after using the Mia.  I first decided to buy the eye cream because I was out of the latest brand I had tried.  Until now, I had never found an eye cream that I thought did every much for me. I stopped buying the expensive ones because they did the same thing as the inexpensive ones, nothing! I had some puffiness in the mornings under the brow area, dark tired looking circles under the eyes, and fine little wrinkles also under the eyes.  After the first application, I went back onto Amazon to read the reviews on the serum and cream.  I decided to buy both of them, feeling a little guilty about how much money I was investing.  And just a month earlier I had purchased the Mia &amp; the Opal(Clarisonic&#x27;s eye machine) for $330.  Well my investment paid a dividend! I feel pretty again!  I&#x27;ve been using the PC products now for about a month and a half. For the first 3 weeks, I used it morning and night.  After that I became lazy and it was hit and miss in the evening. The whole product line holds in the moisture on your face.  If I fall asleep without washing my face, I can still feel it working it&#x27;s magic when I wake up! The elasticity has returned.  My skin has a glow, even after a light brushing with my Bare Minerals. I pretty much agree with everything the others have written.  The \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; feeling the other reviewer mentioned is hard to explain.  It&#x27;s not as bad as \\&quot;sticky\\&quot;, but I&#x27;m not sure what else you&#x27;d call it. I acutally don&#x27;t mind it, in fact I&#x27;ve grown to like it.  When I touch my face I feel the, kind of sticky feel,but I can at the same time feel how firm and soft my face feels, all good. My skin doesn&#x27;t have that tight feeling, but it feels tight to the touch.  I hope that makes sense. Though I myself, don&#x27;t think I look near 21 yrs old, I definately feel like I&#x27;ve turned the hands of the clock back maybe....12 - 15 years.    About the Opal I mentioned above, I&#x27;m not sure it was worthwhile. I bought it because I was desperate to do something to help my eyes look better and to stop the aging process. I was feeling like I was in a tailspin in that area.  I&#x27;ve seen demos where it was tested on people and you could actually see a difference from their first use.  This was not evident on me.  But I continue to use it because who knows, maybe it&#x27;s having a cumulative effect and adding to my younger look.</li>
    <li> Perfective Ceuticals Divine is aptly named.  It&#x27;s a great night cream, one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  It has a faint rose fragrance that&#x27;s icing on the cake for me, though it goes away quickly.  The cream is thick, and seems to have little water in it, so you don&#x27;t have that weird watery sensation that just seems to sit on your face that I&#x27;ve found in a lot of drugstore brands.  This stuff instantly makes my skin feel smooth and moisturized.  The feeling is still there in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s emu oil in this cream, which is pretty much a miracle product in my book.  My husband has found topically applied emu oil to be very effective on arthritis I in his hands, and I can testify that this cream makes my skin supple and younger feeling.  It&#x27;s not a facelift in a jar, but it&#x27;s pretty close to perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference after only one application.  Since I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks, I don&#x27;t seem to need as much makeup, and even in the cold and blustery winter weather we&#x27;ve been having here, my skin has yet to feel dry and tight.  I&#x27;ve been using this cream in conjunction with the Perfective Ceuticals Serum, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample received for review.</li>
    <li> I loved the scent of this cream and didn&#x27;t find it too overbearing. I don&#x27;t think it lingered that long but I do use perfume. I loved that I could use it underneath foundation without the foundation clumping into balls as I rubbed. I did find it a little greasy but letting it soak into the skin a few minutes helped with that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and have started to take notice the changes my skin is going through. I started to notice I developed more noticeable dark spots on my face, my skin looks and feels drier especially during the winter time and I started to develop noticeable wrinkle lines around my eyes.  This product was recommended by a friend so I decided to try it out.  Boy am I glad I did.  What I like about its first is the smell of Jasmine.  My husband has noticed and comments on how nice my face smells when he kisses me.  I also like that this does what it says it does.  After using it for about three months, I was using it for both day and night for about 1 month, and then i switched to use it just night time, but I definitely have noticed my face stays moisturized all day and night.  I also noticed that the small tiny bumps on the bottom of my cheeks have pretty much flattened so my face feels smoother when I run my hands over them.  This one bottle has lasted me a long time.  3 months and I still have at least 1/3 left.  A little goes a long way with this product.  Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually writing reviews but I do read them. I&#x27;m happy to share that I am impressed with Perfective Ceuticals products. It feels lightweight, pleasant to use and leaves your skin feeling very soft toned/firm. Recently I had a baby, and I noticed more wrinkles in several areas on my face. After trying this new anti-age cream I did noticed improvements in those areas.  Also I really like the packaging of this product...it makes me want to hold it and use it more often.  It has a good feel even for your hands.  I would definitely refer to friends and family!</li>
    <li> Great Antiaging cream. Very soft and smooth. Feeling young already and that&#x27;s the truth!</li>
    <li> I have been using this in conjunction with the eye serum and the anti aging serum. I am loving this cream. It goes on light and grease free, and has a delicate floral fragrance that makes me feel ultra pampered. My face is definitely healthier looking now that I have been using this. My skin had been looking old and dry, but since I have been using this product it has started to glow again. As far as face creams go, this one is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I first tried Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Cream with Growth Factor a little while ago when one of my best friends bought is as a sort of gag gift for my birthday. We all got a good chuckle out of it at the time, but once I started using it (why not, right?) I quickly came to realize that it was the most thoughtful gift anyone has given me in quite some time. After using it for just a short time, my face felt so much firmer and started to look like the version of my face I only thought I&#x27;d see again by flipping through old photo albums. Now I see it in the mirror every day! My face has only gotten better since then, and I&#x27;m still not used to people exclaiming over how youthful my skin looks! I just ordered a second jar, and there is no question that the price tag is 100% worth it. Plus, I love the pretty blue sphere design. The cream itself has a wonderfully fresh, delicate floral scent. The texture is thick and rich but the cream soaks in pretty quickly so anyone bothered by heavy-feeling beauty products doesn&#x27;t have to worry about this one.  I have to say: anyone out there who is vacillating between this Perfective Ceuticals face cream and some other anti-aging cream, stop thinking about it! Scroll back up and click that order button. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Now for my thoughts I love the gorgeous jar it came it made me feel like I went to a high priced spa to buy it. I thought it smelled nice not to over powering. I really liked the light creamy texture of it and how it went on easy without leaving behind a greasy feeling. I also liked how quickly it absorbed into the skin leaving it feeling soft. I also liked that after a week of using it several family members noticed a difference in my skin. I didn&#x27;t notice but others did and that made me feel good. Over all I really enjoyed using the product and will continue to do so. It was a real plesure finding a product that worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m NOT satisfy with this product, I got a really bad allergic reaction around my face, also the fragrance is to strong and no pleasant. This is an expensive cream and I did no see any results.</li>
    <li> Wow, this has to be the best skin cream I have ever used.  It really soaks into my skin and plumps it up.  It really makes a difference.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> A product that works from the inside out is something that I want for my skin and the Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Cream does just that. It helps to stimulate your cell rejuvenation and to produce collagen elastin. This is great to help with the fine lines and wrinkles. It also helps even out skin tone and lighten sun spots and discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is so rich and thick and goes on smoothly.All you need is a small amount and apply to your face and neck area. I have not had any irritation to it at all. It makes my skin feel soft and rejuvenated.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product free of charge for review purposes.</li>
    <li> The gene pool has not always been kind to me.  I didn&#x27;t get tall or small,  my neck &amp; waist are too short, my shoulders more like those of a football player.  I did hit the jackpot in two ways though.  I got my mother&#x27;s hair, still nearly as thick, almost as shiny and exactly the same color as it was the day I turned 16 - no gray to be seen.  (My sisters, both younger, both gray for a decade, are livid.)  I also got my Dad&#x27;s good skin, so while I am in the middle of my  seventh decade, I am not as yet a wrinkled old crone.  Still, I have my share of lines, a couple of scars and the beginnings of a few crows&#x27;s feet around my eyes.  You might not notice them, but I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago the folks at Perfective Ceuticals asked me if I would like to try some of their products.  Not long after a box landed on my doorstep containing three of their Anti-aging products -  [[ASIN:B004B9C8MO Anti-aging Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Cream with Growth Factor]], [[ASIN:B0030DK7E8 Anti-aging Serum - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor]] and [[ASIN:B00AYARK2C Anti-aging Eye Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy Cream with Growth Factor ]].  Since then, I&#x27;ve been using my regular cleaning regimen, followed by the application of the Perfective products.  I must say, I am impressed.  My skin is moister and my lines less apparent,  I&#x27;ve particularly noticed a fairly dramatic difference in the scars, which have become pretty hard to differentiate from ordinary wrinkles, and the no-longer-crepey skin of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004B9C8MO Anti-aging Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Cream with Growth Factor]], best used after application of the [[ASIN:B0030DK7E8 Anti-aging Serum - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor]], smells faintly of roses.  A tiny dab goes a long ways, leaving the skin soft and moist without being greasy or heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that you should note - this product does contain Retinol A, only problematic for a minor few who have some sensitivity to it.  Do, however, be sure to wear a sunscreen out of doors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 - Really nice, effective cream.

    <li> Summers are pretty brutal in Michigan but winters are worse.  Usually I can see the damage from the cold and wind on the backs of my hands and then on my face.  No matter how much lotion I put on my face, it seems to absorb it.  This winter, after a few months of using Divine Age Guardian Cr&amp;egrave;me, my hands are getting raspy and wrinkly from the cold, but my face is not.  The directions say to use this twice a day but I have been getting by with using it once, in the morning, over the Divine Age Guardian Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the issue isn’t so much younger looking skin, but healthy skin.  I love the feeling of good, clean, moisturized skin and how soft it feels, from the inside and the outside.  After almost 30 years of using Clinique, I began to feel like the moisturizers were pretty similar in results, even though they seemed to be becoming even more Advanced and Extra everything.  Their costs also seemed to be going up exponentially for smaller and smaller containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember the beautiful bottles and jars my mom had on her dresser when I was little.  They were always just a little out of reach and a little too fragile for a child’s hands.  They were looked pretty and they were small and smelled like clean linen.  These bottles are so pretty and of such a nice color that they remind me of the bottles that were always out of reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Divine Age Guardian Cream every day for a month, and, wow, what a difference in my skin. To be honest, I never expected that a moisturizing cream, even one as pricey as this, could make much of an impact on the texture of my skin; I had used a different brand of moisturizer every day, so I expected this one to subsitute for that, perhaps with a more penetrating moisturizer.  But this cream, when combined with the Divine Age Guardian serum and eye cream, did much more.  My face not only feels softer, but the skin looks more supple.  No, it did not erase the lines already there -- it&#x27;s not plastic surgery after all and I *am* in my early fifties.  It did restore some elasticity and made my facial skin look less thin, however.  For that, I&#x27;m sticking with this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the cream is somewhat thick, as creams tend to be, it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy look or feel.  My skin pretty much sucks it up right away.  I can put on make-up right away.  I noticed a difference in feel in a couple of days, and the appearance changes occurred after about a week of application, maxxing out around three weeks.  I used the cream for twice a day for the first two weeks, then used it sometimes only once a day since I need a moisturizer with sunscreen when I am going to be outside during the day.  A Perfective Ceuticals anti-aging cream with SPF 15 would be perfect!  The once-a-day application doesn&#x27;t seem to diminish the results already there; however, I recommend starting out twice a day because the results might be more astonishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream contains epidermal growth factor, something consumers should be aware of in case they have any concerns.  Although this cream contains something called \\&quot;beefsteak extract,\\&quot; this is a plant extract, not a meat product despite the name.  I have sensitive skin, and I had no reactions to this product, not even a break-in breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really, really love this cream and its results. (Note:  The manufacturer provided a sample for review.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmannreview.)    -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
    <li> I have been using Perfective Ceuticals Anti-aging Cream for slightly over three weeks to improve the appearance of the skin on my face and deck. Overall, I like it but would have preferred the unscented version. This cream is recommended to be used twice a day. I don&#x27;t mind the scent in the morning, but strong scents keep me from falling asleep at night. It would have been great if this cream was available in unscented version as well. Using the cream I see some improvement, although it is only a relative improvement not total obliteration of the fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am attaching a photo of the open cream tub (photo can be located by following &#x27;customer photos&#x27; link under the main photo). The cream is creamy white and has a strong rose smell. The container is very attractive ball, which hold 50 ml of cream inside of it. Direction say to apply a small amount to the face and neck with gentle and smooth circular movements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream spreads nicely, leaves no shine so I can put it on and go out without worrying about tell-tell shine under my eyes. I am applying the cream twice a day in the morning and in the evening. I prefer fragrance free cosmetics, I hope in the future Perfective Ceuticals will develop the same cream without a scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this cream for testing and evaluation from the manufacturer. Having this direct line to them I wrote to them asking the details about the &amp;#34;growth&amp;#34; factor mentioned in the name. I wanted to understand better what this was and whether it could have any negative effects by penetrating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received an explanation that Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) is a protein with 53 amino acids. It is very large in size and not able to penetrate into the skin topically. It is approved for cosmetic use by the FDA and there is no evidence topically applied EGF causes skin cancer cells to multiply faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EGF works by reducing the length and depth of fine lines. Matrixyl (Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4) helps reduce eye puffiness by strengthening the elasticity of the eye skin area. Omega 3-6-9 and Ginseng Extract helps correct imperfections by stimulating cellular regeneration and microcirculation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complete list of ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua), Cyclopentasiloxane, Triethylhexanoin, Olive Squalane, Emu Oil, Dimethicone, Glycerin, 1-Butylene Glycol, 3-Butylene Glycol, Dimethicone/CopolyolCrosspolymer, Matrixyl (Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4), Polyquaternium-51, Raffinose, Beefsteak Extract, Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Ginseng Extract, Licorice Extract, Lactic Acid, Hydroxyproline, Vitamin E Acetate, Retinol, Sodium Hyaluronate, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In response to my inquiry the manufacturer also sent me an article published in a Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (&amp;#34;Human growth factor and cytokine skin cream for facial skin rejuvenation as assessed by 3D in vivo optical skin imaging&amp;#34; Journal of Drugs in Dermatology, Oct, 2007 by Michael H.

    <li> I just walked El Camino de Santiago in Spain, a 500 mile hike that lasted 33 days. I was out in the sun all day, walking 5 to 9 hours daily. I wore toxin-free sunscreen every day, but my skin took a beating from the sunscreen and a bit from the sun as well. My face had aged a lot that month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I returned home, thank God this product was waiting for me to try! I used it every night before sleeping to let it does its rejuvenation thing. Within weeks I could tell the difference. The leathery appearance of my face faded, as did the subtle wrinkles. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate the container. I tend to drop things at times and have many a cosmetic ruined because when it drops the glass breaks. When I dropped this, the plastic container didn&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Schenck, author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit &amp; Planet&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;Beyond Broccoli, Creating a Biologically Balanced Diet When a Vegetarian Diet Doesn&#x27;t Work&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;Expats in Cuenca, Ecuador: The Magic &amp; The Madness</li>
    <li> I have been using this only at night after I wash my face, and I really feel that my face does feel better.  Even though I am middle-aged, I don&#x27;t have that many wrinkles yet, but I want to make sure that I keep my skin looking as youthful and healthy as possible.  It is really important to me that a product works from the inside out, and not the other way around.  I truly believe that a product must first work on the dermis rather than just something that is spread over the epidermis in order for it to work well.  I am happy to have found a product that does work first on the dermis because beauty does start on the inside first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally have sensitive skin, but have found no irritation from this product.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have been using the suite of Perfective Ceuticals products for 2 months. Though I noted in my reviews of the serum and eye cream that I had not seen any diminishment in the appearance of wrinkles or lines during these 2 months, I do feel that the moisturizing cream is quite effective. I have very dry skin and have always used a moisturizer twice daily. The Perfective Ceuticals cream is so effective that I really just need to use a few dabs to moisturize my entire face and neck. The container is still about half full, so I expect to get at least 2 more months use out of it. It goes on smoothly and leaves so greasy residue. It is a bit sticky at first, but I usually wait a few minutes before applying my makeup. My skin is soft and supple, though I don&#x27;t believe I look any younger :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cobalt blue packaging is quite striking, and I leave the blue sphere out on my bathroom counter since it is so attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received sample products from the manufacturer for my trials.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference the first time I tried this product. It felt light and did not leave my skin feeling greasy. Since I have combination skin I am skeptical trying new moisturizers. After the first week my skin looked smoother/firmer and had a healthy glow. This is a great product!</li>
    <li> This cream is great for sensitive skin.  It has a light rose scent, but it is not overpowering. I&#x27;ve been using the cream with the serum, and the texture of my skin is noticeably smoother.  I have combination skin, and I was concerned that it would be too greasy. However, it absorbs quickly and my skin feels hydrated, but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived on time, and they even included samples of the eye cream.</li>
    <li> When the order I placed did not come, I called Gorgeous Find and they were extremely helpful in making sure I received it. I really recommend this specific product Anti-Age Cream. You notice the difference immediately! I know it may be on the expensive side, but it has all the necessary elements for your skin. Will continue to purchase products from this company in the future!</li>
    <li> I work outside all day and the weather here gets pretty chilly and dry. This stuff is so rich and hydrating and yet it absorbs quickly. I use it two times per day and have done so for nearly a week. In terms of wrinkles, I have used this for one month and have seen some improvement (not like what some of you say on here) and I even emailed the company.  They said for wrinkles, need to wait three months to see the full effect so I guess I have to wait a bit longer.</li>
    <li> There are many anti-aging creams out there, but I really feel this one is a face-lift in a cute blue sphere!!! The only down side I find is the hit your pocket book takes.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this. With all the great reviews and the cost I thought it had to be good. It did nothing for my skin! Plus it has Paraben in its ingredients which is a Carcinogen!</li>
    <li> Love this product haven&#x27;t had long enough to tell what it will do for my skin. But I definitely love the feel and touch of this cream it is really thick and silky and when I put this on it soaks right into my skin.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Light, non greasy, good results.  It has hardly any scent which I prefer, and my skin looks great when I use it.</li>
    <li> Face cream or lotion? When I was younger I just rubbed the same lotion that I applied all over my body to my face. Then age and weathering starting catching up to me. LOL @ weathering - just like the stream wearing down the canyon walls so does each year to my body.&lt;br /&gt;Now I apply a face cream - which just seems like a thicker lotion. I have been using the Perfective Ceuticals Face Cream for several weeks. I honestly have mixed feelings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice, sort of &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; according to my teens. It applies easily and absorbs quickly. It also doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily or feeling like it is being smothered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like a great product doesn&#x27;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I get to the ingredients and the pricing. That is where I start having problems. Some of the ingredients Methylparaben, Ethylparaben) are ones that I have learned should be avoided on the facial area. Add those to the price point for this product and there lives my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while it may feel great on my skin, I can&#x27;t say that I would purchase it again. For this reason alone, I rated it a 4 of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
    <li> I tried this on both myself and my mother (mid-forties and mid-sixties respectively) in a two week trial in conjunction with the Perfective Ceuticals Anti-Aging Serum. What a difference! Both of us have dry, sensitive skin. This product tightened and brightened in addition to its intensive moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of us had visible results, more noticeable for mom, who had wrinkle reduction around the nose and mouth. I noticed that the lines on my neck were visibly reduced. The scent is very light and fresh and minimal, which I appreciated both from an aesthetic point of view and because it wasn&#x27;t too pronounced or likely to cause irritation. Neither of us had any irritation whatsoever using these products. This is an important consideration, as those with sensitive skin can have issues even with expensive products. The cream is incredibly rich and feels wonderful going on. It leaves the face and neck feeling smooth, moist and flexible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that my skin tone was more even and that my pores were tighter and that my skin was just brighter and younger looking. Mom had all of these effects plus some visible reduction of wrinkles. It feels luxurious going on and lives up to its claims and its price. A dab between a pea and a dime does the entire face and neck and I expect the generously sized jar to last longer than comparably sized products. In addition, I loved the packaging and the containers. The round container looks nice sitting on the vanity and is a lovely metallic blue somewhere between navy and midnight. I definitively recommend this to women in the second half of life, especially those with dry and/or sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> When I was asked if I&#x27;d like to try Perfective Ceuticals products containing Growth Factor, I was skeptical. I am a &#x27;Doubting Thomas&#x27;. You know &#x27;seeing is believing&#x27;. I decided I didn&#x27;t have anything to lose, so I accepted their generous offer and made it known that I would write an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first thought: &#x27;If this product line works, how will I prove it?&#x27;...you know &#x27;seeing is believing&#x27;. So I got out my point and shoot camera &amp; took some before pictures. Oh, my gosh, the pictures I took wouldn&#x27;t prove anything. Apparently the cameras used to take before photos are of a different quality than my point and shoot. So, I am sorry, but I will not be able to provide evidence for you to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my mid 60&#x27;s, have a fair complexion which is sprinkled with light colored freckles. As a natural stawberry blonde, I sunburn easily. I&#x27;ve never been a sun worshiper so I don&#x27;t have many deep wrinkles, just normal aging wrinkles with deeper wrinkles around my mouth (marionette lines?). My d&amp;eacute;colletage is wrinkly too...yuck! I have a couple light colored  spots on my face too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw improvement quickly when I began  using these Perfective Ceutical Anti-aging Guardian products  2 1/2 weeks ago:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0030DK7E8 Anti-aging Serum - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00AYARK2C Anti-aging Eye Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy Cream with Growth Factor (New Packaging)]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004B9C8MO Anti-aging Cream - Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Cream with Growth Factor]]&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been applying them, as instructed, twice a day. I&#x27;ve also have been applying the serum &amp; this cream to my d&amp;eacute;colletage.  (applying to this area isn&#x27;t mentioned, but I wanted to see if my d&amp;eacute;colletage area improved). Being a thrifty person, I also experimented by using these products once a day. It didn&#x27;t take long for me to discover that I had much better results when I used them twice a day. So twice a day it is. This cream has a very, light rose  fragrance. It is the only product of the three that has a fragrance. This  light creamy lotion  absorbs quickly yet I can feel it on my skin long after I&#x27;ve applied it. My forehead especially has an &#x27;oily&#x27; feel.  If you have oily skin, this cream might prove too heavy for you. As it is, I like it, but once in a while I apply less to my forehead. On the days I use sunless tanner, I wait about 4 hours before I apply Perfective Ceutical&#x27;s product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw improvement after using these products for two days. My wrinkles are still there, but less noticeable. My d&amp;eacute;colletage improved, my light colored age spots are a bit lighter,, my neck area is better, the pores are a little smaller. There has been a marked improvement with the wrinkles/lines from my nose to my mouth.  As it is, I don&#x27;t look half bad without using foundation. Although, when i want to look my best, foundation is a must.  All in all, I&#x27;ve seen a definite improvement &amp; saw it within two days of use. I&#x27;ve been told I look 10 years younger. Keep in mind that my skin is not sun damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could tell you which product to try first, but since I&#x27;ve been using them together, I&#x27;m not sure. Because these products are pricey, I might opt to try the serum first. Another thought is to email Perfective Ceuticals and ask their opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not store this product in extreme heat or cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product guarantee copied from Perfective Ceutical&#x27;s website:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Perfective Ceuticals&#x27; products are designed to be sold exclusively by dermatologists and dermatology professionals.

    <li> I received a sample of Perfective Ceuticals, and was impressed with the results. I really wish the photos of the actual container did it justice. I usually never comment on the container, but it is really stunning and beautiful. It is a blue orb (as you can see), but it is also super reflective. It is a really beautiful container for an incredible lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the time I used the lotion, my skin softened significantly. I only have very fine lines and wrinkles, so I did not see a dramatic change in those, but based on the difference in texture it created, I believe the other reviews that it can make a huge difference lines and wrinkles. What I loved most was it was thick enough to be used as a night cream, but I could also use it for daily wear as it provided a good base for my morning make-up</li>
    <li> I have a few \\&quot;lines\\&quot; on my face I&#x27;ve been trying to come to terms with since they showed up one day. The first were the little creases that show up around the mouth (laugh lines). They&#x27;re small right now, but I see them. Especially when I&#x27;m applying makeup. While I&#x27;ve been useing light mineral makeup for the last 6 months or so instead of thicker foundation, I still notice that the makeup will over the day, settle into the lines on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a small line under each of my eyes, that I notice every time I apply my eyeliner. As much as I try not to pay attention to them, it&#x27;s hard not to when your makeup actually ends up settling into them. And before the lines on my face, I discovered I have a very significant crease on my neck. While I may be in my early 30&#x27;s, the \\&quot;lines\\&quot; are slowly sneaking up on me, and just putting a little moisturizer on my face isn&#x27;t making them go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for the last several weeks I&#x27;ve been using the Perfective Ceuticals anti-aging system to see if it would help with my situation. I&#x27;ve been using this Divine Age Guardian Cream with Growth Factor and also the Divine Age Guardian Serum with Growth Factor and Anti-imperfection Eye Therapy with Growth Factor. I&#x27;ve been using them in the recommended order of first applying the serum, then applying the eye cream, then finally this face cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first changed I noticed was that after the first few weeks, my makeup wasn&#x27;t settling into my smile lines as much anymore. Some days I can&#x27;t see the lines at all. Next I started noticing that I had less and less problems applying my eye makeup, since it wasn&#x27;t bleeding into the tiny lines under each of my eyes. Before the lines themselves started to fade, my makeup was showing my the difference, by not settling into them. I&#x27;ve been quite pleased with how well this anti-aging system has worked, and have noticed some fading now also on the much more obvious neck crease. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing just how much it will continue to smooth out my skin, with continued use. The trio of anti-aging facial products works well to target each area specifically, and all at the same time. I&#x27;m very happy with how well they work together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided for reviewing purposes.t will continue to smooth out my skin, with continued use.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my Divine Age Guardian Cream morning and night for the last few weeks and have been impressed! My skin has not been dry at all (even while using heavy acne-fighting products) and my skin looks brighter and feels softer and smoother than it has in awhile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time of year my sun spots usually start to pop out more, especially on my forehead because I&#x27;m in the sun a whole bunch, but while using this awesome cream, my sun spots have been very minimal and if anything, have faded a bit, even though I always get more nasty sun spots in the summer!</li>
    <li> Having been approached by Pefective for a possible review, I did some investigating on their website.  Being very particular about what I use on my skin, I needed to know what the ingredients of this product before I said yes.  How they knew that I was an a age where I needed age-defying creams, I couldn&#x27;t guess, but now days it&#x27;s all about moisture and getting those skin cells boosted into high gear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the list of what exactly goes into Perfective, I was anxious to try give the product a try.  Here are some of the ingredients that caught my attention: olive squalane, emu oil, oligo peptide, ginseng extract, licorice extract, lactic acid, vitamin E, retinol A, and other things that I couldn&#x27;t pronounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face cream I was given is supposed to work on repairing my skin by boosting the production of protein and collagen and storing my lipid barrier.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now, and my skin does feel wonderful, but honestly, I use the high end(expensive) Estee&#x27; Lauder products so I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, except that the Divine Age Guardian Cr&amp;egrave;me has a wonderful light scent, while some of the other high end products are unusable because of their heavy scent. I definitely would choose this cream over what I have been using. (I went back to my previous creams and I found that Perfective was a whole lot better than what I was using. Now I have an array of very expensive creams that I don&#x27;t want to use any more because Perfective is so much better, and less expensive. I will only be using Perfective from now on.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Divine Cr&amp;egrave;me goes on like silk and no matter how many layers I choose to apply, it never fells heavy or greasy.  It just soaked right into my skin without leaving me with that glossy look that comes from sitting only on the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I really liked about the Divine Cr&amp;egrave;me, was that there was no added sunscreen.  I&#x27;ve read up enough about sunscreen to only use an all natural brand, which I apply everyday, so I don&#x27;t want any extra, especially when I use the cr&amp;egrave;me at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, and while this is probably not important to anyone else, the Divine Cr&amp;egrave;me comes in the beautiful round, midnight blue jar that is easy to open, and looks great sitting out on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold on the Divine Cr&amp;egrave;me and I&#x27;ll be buying more in the future.  I&#x27;m always happen to be using the latest and the greatest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Io only use an all natural brand, which I apply everyday, so I don&#x27;t want any extra, especially when I use the cr&amp;egrave;me at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, and while this is probably not important to anyone else, the Divine Cr&amp;egrave;me comes in the beautiful round, midnight blue jar that is easy to open, and looks great sitting out on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold on the Divine Cr&amp;egrave;me and I&#x27;ll be buying more in the future.

    <li> I am in love with this cream! It is perfect for my perpetually dry, problematic and extremely sensitive skin! It has worked extremely well with hydration, moisture retention and evening out my skin tone. It has also worked very well on the fine lines that have started showing on the sides of my nose. These fine lines annoy me beyond words and I am very happy that are products out there that are readily available for consumers like me who don&#x27;t want to resort to botox. I love the scent of this cream and my skin has never looked healthier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a blogger, I am often provided Press Sample kits by companies for review purposes.

    <li> I am 40 years old with oily/combination skin.  This was a wonderful alternative to my favorite anti-aging cream, Artistry Luxury Creme, which is far too expensive for me to purchase regularly.  Perfective Ceuticals Divine Age Guardian Cream made my skin soft and supple, the overall tone looked better, and my skin looked healthier.  I used this primarily at night, and I was very pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should really buy more of this, but the price tag is a bit steep, so I am testing other, less expensive, anti-aging creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to make a suggestion to the manufacturer of this product:  Change the packaging.  I read a review here on Amazon about someone losing their grip on this container, and I did the same thing.  I know it looks nice, but it&#x27;s not very functional.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it I was in awe of the texture of this cream!  I could tell it was like nothing I ever used before.  In words its really hard to describe its not thin like a lotion it has a really good texture that I loved instantly.  I applied this to my face and neck in a circular motion.  The first night I used way to much and it took a long time to absorb.  The point I&#x27;m trying to make is a little bit goes a long way you don&#x27;t have to over do it!&lt;br /&gt;I know a lot of lotions leave a greasy gross feeling.  With Divine Age Guardian cream I didn&#x27;t have this.  It took about 5 minutes (when I used the proper amount) for it to absorb into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The very next day my skin felt healthier!  My skin feels healthy and I know the cream will keep me looking young longer</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product.  It didn&#x27;t take 3 products or 5 steps, it was easily applied after my shower without leaving me oily.  I&#x27;m a busy mom so being able to apply and go is a must! It helps keep my skin hydrated and soft during the day!  Love this creme!</li>
    <li> I use Perfective Ceuticals cream over the Perfective Ceuticals serum and eye cream to seal them in. At bedtime, that&#x27;s all I need. In the mornings, I layer Perfective Ceuticals sunscreen over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using before and after photos three weeks apart, I can see a definite improvement in lightening of my liver spots. My kids noticed that right away. They also said my skin looks younger. I can&#x27;t argue with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With other creams, I put them on, they dry, and then it&#x27;s like there&#x27;s nothing there. With Perfective Ceuticals cream, I literally feel it on my skin all day, protecting it and locking in the moisture. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it. It works, and I&#x27;m happy to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review by Perfective Ceuticals.</li>
