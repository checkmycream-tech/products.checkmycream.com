      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>The primer does its job efficiently whereas the liner sealer is amazing to use.  </li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>The primer is okay, nothing spectacular but does the job fairly well.</li>
      <li>It is a pointy felt tip-like thing... gives a nice line.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say the Primer works like</li>
      <li>you can imagine, or what you own.  </li>
      <li>To be honest, I haven&#x27;t even checked out the primer side yet.</li>
      <li>this is the absolute best product I have.  </li>
      <li>I like the eye liner better than the primer, but both are good.</li>
      <li>The sealer is good, but you have to remember to hold the dispenser with the sealer at the bottom and the primer at the top because the sealer runs out if you</li>
      <li>What makes this product great is the liner Sealer, last all day and man it wonderful  being able to use my eyeshadows as eyeliner too.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t come off of the stick very easily and onto my eyelid.</li>
      <li>The Liner sealer is incredible; you can really take any eyeshadow and make it your liner.</li>
      <li>I believe I own an eyeliner in many shades and it takes up space, believe me.  </li>
      <li>so it looks nice for most part of the day</li>
      <li>I prefer cream primer, but this is a nice (and better priced) alternative to what I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply, lasts all day!  </li>
      <li>I love elf cosmetics, this primer is awesome so far I have gone all day with no creasing or smudging .</li>
      <li>primer is OK, but pulls at the eyelid tissue when you put it on.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
      <li>I love the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
      <li>The liner sealer works better than the primer does.  </li>
      <li>The sealer side turns my favorite eye shadow into liquid liner.</li>
      <li>Mac counter sells it for much more.  </li>
      <li>Most liquid eyeliners irritates my eyes, causing them to tear, which washes away the eyeliner.</li>
      <li>I saw this had a primer its not liquid tube more like stick tube  </li>
      <li>As for the liner sealer, i really love making my eyeshadow into eyeliner.</li>
      <li>It is my sincere hope</li>
      <li>If elf sold just the sealer I would purchase it for sure (there are better eye primers out there).  </li>
      <li>It would be better if it were liquid.</li>
      <li>It allows you to use an eyeshadow as eyeliner.. and it works a lot better than just using water or something.</li>
      <li>Item is ok..</li>
      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>- just dip into your favorite color eyeshadow</li>
      <li>You prime your lids and under-brow, then apply your shadow, and then the best part...turn that same color shadow into a matching eye liner.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I used to use the Mary Kay primer and that worked better.</li>
      <li>finally found one that works perfectly!</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>#34;I love your make-up&amp;#34; compliments all the time.</li>
      <li>I do have oily skin, so maybe it works better for others.</li>
      <li>You just can&#x27;t get a better eye lid primer and make-it-yourself eyeliner than this.</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this, but I just don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I prefer more of a pinkish concealer.  </li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
      <li>It works much better</li>
      <li>The liner was ok.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got this so my eyeshadow would stay on longer. and sure enough it lasts but not all day. I like it because its cheap and still works better then most.</li>
    <li> Use this everyday when applying my makeup!</li>
    <li> The liner sealer works better than the primer does.  But for the price, it&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
    <li> it came fast shipping and its new . I always used the eyelid primer from elf . I saw this had a primer its not liquid tube more like stick tube  that I like . I do recommend it .</li>
    <li> I thought this was supposed to seal the liner I already have on. It doesn&#x27;t; it takes it right off.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. The primer doesn&#x27;t work at all...I actually think it might increase the creasing of my eyeshadow a lot sooner than if I had not used it. Only saving grace was the liner sealer, I really liked that. Overall, I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I really love the primer, it&#x27;s long-lasting, neutral color , clear, I have no issues. The sealer is a gadget which transforms an eyeshadow to a liquid eyeliner. It&#x27;s really useful. I hope you&#x27;ll like it too.</li>
    <li> looks great but performs average. dosen&#x27;t cover up that well</li>
    <li> E.L.F. always makes quality products.  Some of which give the department store brands a run for their money</li>
    <li> I love the eye makeup primer, but mainly I&#x27;ve been looking for an eye liner sealer that I could use with some of my eye liners that just aren&#x27;t long-lasting.  I&#x27;ve found that the secret to using this is to let the eye liner set (no matter what kind -- pencil, gel, etc.) before using the sealer.  If you don&#x27;t, the sealer will take up the liner.  If you wait though, it works.</li>
    <li> You just can&#x27;t get a better eye lid primer and make-it-yourself eyeliner than this. The primer takes away any redness on your lids,  or elsewhere,  like under your brow.  Then the other end, moist from the liquid it comes in, can be dragged across any eye shadow to become eye liner. You prime your lids and under-brow, then apply your shadow, and then the best part...turn that same color shadow into a matching eye liner. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Item is ok.. Kinda hard to open the gel part. The primer itself pulls the skin too much. I&#x27;d prefer urban decay.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. The primer does its job efficiently whereas the liner sealer is amazing to use.  I now have so many different color combinations with my eye shadows that I am thrilled.  It is definitely worth the time to click the button and buy this product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for my usual brand on both the website from which it comes, as well as here on Amazon, but it was sold out at both places.  So, I began searching for a replacement, and came across this one.  After reading the favorable reviews, I purchased one for myself.  It arrived a few days later, on time, and in a protective packaging, but I have been busy as I am in school for the summer, and so I wasn&#x27;t able to try it until today.  One reason I bought this is that for the last part of spring and much of the summer, I deal with allergies (watery eyes part of that.) I had read another reviewer mention she suffers from dry eye and she too has watery eyes, but after using the liner sealer, her liner stayed put.  I find nothing more frustrating than dealing with trying too put on eyeliner with watery eyes! Even my waterproof liners don&#x27;t seem to stay put on days when dealing with watery eyes.  I even  tried putting a matching wet/dry shadow over it, but as always, I would look in the mirror and my right eye would look good,but my left eye had missing eyeliner on the outer bottom corner of my left eye.  In any event, today I tried this product, both the primer and the liner sealer,  My eyes were watery today, but after using the liner sealer, my liner (eye shadow turned waterproof liquid liner) stayed on and I am impressed.  In fact, I am debating the idea of sticking with this product over the other brand I usually use, just for the liner sealer.  I read another customer stating she wished they would consider just selling the liner sealer, and I am in total agreement with her.  I believe I own an eyeliner in many shades and it takes up space, believe me.  With this you would only need this product and an eye shadow to have waterproof liner in just about any  color you can imagine, or what you own.  I have yet to try it with wet/dry shadow but suspect it would be a great duo-(the shadow and liner sealer).  I love the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;As for the primer, again, my shadow stayed on my eyes well.  I used a concealer brush to apply which made the application much easier than using my fingers, and how I usually apply my eye primers.  For me  it is the best way to apply and this was no different.&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is one product I was happy to find and glad I purchased.  It is my sincere hope that e.l.f. will, 1) never stop making or selling this product as I will buy it from now on, and 2) consider just selling the Liner Sealer, and again, I will buy it forever. A great product from a great seller! If you are looking for a true waterproof liquid liner look no further than this product, some shadow and your imagination for experimenting with different color liners.  Not only will it save you money and space on too many liners that may or may not stay on, but the price is right for a product that truly works.  Buy this.  You will not be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this almost every morning since I bought it (almost two years ago - I should change it out, I know) and it&#x27;s still great! I use the primer side almost exclusively, which is apparently unusual, but I don&#x27;t have as much use for the sealer side as I thought I would. The primer goes on smoothly and makes eyeliner application a breeze, and it seems to help the eyeliner stay on longer. I&#x27;ll definitely be getting another one of these when I run out.</li>
    <li> Item was broken as soon as I opened the package. What a waste of money ,</li>
    <li> Very difficult to apply. Couldn&#x27;t use at all. Went in the trash.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I see much of a difference. My make-up seems to stay on just as long without this product.</li>
    <li> My eyeshadows stay until I wash them away and the colors I use really show up! This is an excellent eyelid primer and the other end of the product can be used to make eyeliner out of any eyeshadow I want.</li>
    <li> I like this duo.&lt;br /&gt;The primer helps keep the eyeshadow on, but when using it, a small amount is all that is needed. It goes on smoothly, and dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The sealer is okay, but really is only good for one color. I mistakenly used it with a dark shadow for liner, and returned it to the bottle. Every use after that one has been muddied with the color mixing with the original dark color.</li>
    <li> Get this just for the sealer, the primer creases. Imagine a primer creasing and its winter still. As well the sellers communication is not the best anyways.</li>
    <li> Liner sealer burns when it gets your eyes, and the primer is cakey and causes your eye makeup to crease.</li>
    <li> The primer is an odd color, it makes my eyelids orange and it kind of looks weird with eye shadow on top of the primer. It creases and mixes with the eyeshadow. I probably would not purchase again as I am not going to get that much use out of the liner sealer. However, I only spent 3 dollars on this item from target. Like I said, unless you have orangey skin already this primer is probably not for you.</li>
    <li> Not so impressed. I usually like e.l.f. products too. I bought it for the eye primer, and was excited that it also came with a liner sealer. Neither work very well for me though. I bought a cheap NYC eyeshadow palette and it comes with an eye primer that is surprisingly awesome. This primer, however, does not measure up at all. Does not keep eyeshadow on any longer than if I didn&#x27;t use the primer at all. The liner sealer did not make a difference to me whatsoever either. Disappointed. :-(</li>
    <li> The primer isn&#x27;t anything special, just a typical primer. I wouldn&#x27;t say it makes my eyeshadow last any longer with than without it. I still haven&#x27;t quite figured out how to use the other side.. The brush does not wipe clean easily.</li>
    <li> the primer does not work at all, it still creases and mixes with your eye shadow which as a result makes your eyes look muddy, the sealer STINGS your eyes a lot. it is very watery as well and it smells very chemically,</li>
    <li> Great product does what it says</li>
    <li> This product does its job and does not break the bank. Great product. I will be buying it from now on.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say the Primer works like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt smudge nor fade out as I apply the eyeshadow&lt;br /&gt;The Sealer hasnt gotten much use though so I cant say much about it&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend this to friend.</li>
    <li> I use the exact same eyeshadow, eyeliner and mascara every day. The only thing I did differently was add this item - e.l.f. Eye Primer and Sealer to my routine. I applied the primer first, then my normal eyeshadow  and eye liner, then the sealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the product didn&#x27;t work as advertised. My makeup still smudged and ran. Second, I ended up going to the doctor the next day because my eye had swollen up and was painful. He said I had a stye which was caused by a blocked eyelash gland. I&#x27;ve never had a stye before and the only thing that changed in my beauty routine was adding this product.</li>
    <li> Neat 2 in 1concept.  The primer goes on smooth and my eye shadow lasts all day.  The line sealer is great because you can use it with any eye shadow to make a liner that stays put even in the Florida heat! Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Great eyeshadow primer; I normally use more expensive product so I was really pleased when I placed this product on one lid and the more expensive product on the other lid and found this product measured up after 8 hours wear.  The Liner sealer is incredible; you can really take any eyeshadow and make it your liner.</li>
    <li> I líked it!  It is the same thing of the picture right there! It is so awesome! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I would say this gives me a few extra hours of eye liner in place, but it doesn&#x27;t last all day. I used to use the Mary Kay primer and that worked better. I&#x27;m not throwing this one away, but I doubt I will buy it again once it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> love this, the other elf primers were liquid and terrible -- this one is easy to blend and apply, my eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t crease and lasts all day :)</li>
    <li> I love it I use it for eyeshadow primer and it&#x27;s wonderful</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.  Any color eyeshadow can be used as a long lasting liner.  It&#x27;s cheaper to buy the little bottle of elf liner sealer though,  and use a brush or reuse the felt tip pen-like thing that this has.  The lid primer is ok,  no big shakes.</li>
    <li> I have oily eyelids and my eyeshadow always fades throughout the day. But the primer actually enhances my eyeshadow color and keeps it on all day:)))</li>
    <li> I was kind of skeptical but this stuff really works my eye make up stays on all day love it!</li>
    <li> I like the eye liner better than the primer, but both are good. The primer could go on a little more smoothly. Still, excellent product for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thick and pasty but goes on well if you rub it in. The shadows seem to stay fresh at the lash and brow line, but the primer doesn&#x27;t prevent creasing (which is what I was hoping for) over all I&#x27;d say it works as a consealer but shadows still crease and wear off on the middle. The liner was ok. I used it a few trimester but the lines were so thin and transparent that I&#x27;ve. It trikes it again. Maybe a different color would work better but I prefer the  lighter colors (browns not blacks) and it doesn&#x27;t work well with lighter shades. I also found the exact same product at Walmart for about $3.85, and this seller charged more plus shipping.</li>
    <li> The primer is very difficult to apply. It doesn&#x27;t come off of the stick very easily and onto my eyelid. It would be better if it were liquid. After struggling to apply, I still get creases in my eye shadow, which doesn&#x27;t stay on very long. I  bought this product for the primer and didn&#x27;t try the sealer.</li>
    <li> The primer end is not very effective. It&#x27;s quite dry so it pulls on the eyelid, goes on unevenly, and results in a splotchy shadow application. The liner sealer is much better, with a fine applicator brush. I bought this plus the Emani minerals sealer so I could compare and found the latter to be a much better buy.</li>
    <li> I use the eyeliner primer.  I use a pencil liner, then I dip the liner primer into a coordinating eyeshadow and go over the line.  It keeps my liner in place all day.</li>
    <li> I have &amp;#34;divided&amp;#34; feelings about this product.  First of all the eye shadow primer formulation part of this dual&lt;br /&gt;product is smooth and creamy and does a fine job of keeping one&#x27;s eyeshadow in place all day. However,&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry I cannot say the same for the eyeliner sealer. I could not concentrate on how well this eyeliner&lt;br /&gt;sealant may have worked because I was too busy trying to keep it from running and dripping everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps e.l.f. should have used a &amp;#34;sealer&amp;#34; for their sealer.  I grew weary of the watery deluge and just poured&lt;br /&gt;it all out in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to break up couples but I believe a &amp;#34;separation&amp;#34; would benefit both parties.  Lol.&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, I would be willing to purchase the eye primer again as a separate product.</li>
    <li> My liner still runs, so this product is useless.</li>
    <li> The primer did not keep my eye shadow crease free.  I tried it twice - both times it creased as if I had no primer. It reminds me of the old lipstick-like concealer in a tube. Which never worked either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liner does work - I use it with a dark eye shadow to go over my pencil liner. Be careful when opening.  Always hold that end down when unscrewing, because that stuff will pour out.</li>
    <li> The primer is okay, nothing spectacular but does the job fairly well. What makes this product great is the liner Sealer, last all day and man it wonderful  being able to use my eyeshadows as eyeliner too.</li>
    <li> What can I say about...simply wonderful.  With this little tool, your make-up will last ALL DAY until you remove it.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.  Mac counter sells it for much more.  Even though it&#x27;s a different applicator, it has the same results.  Last forever!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my 62 year old mother who has recently become interested in playing with makeup and eye shadows. She lives in Hawaii so the humidity often makes eyeshadow fade faster and since she has more mature skin, she wanted to try a primer to make the eyelid more smooth for application. She loves the elf eye primer and sealer! She says the primer goes on smooth which she loves because some of them go on a bit chalky. She says the primer makes the eyeshadow go on smoother, the colors come out more vibrant, and they last all day without fading or creasing. She is especially in love with the sealer and has been experimenting with turning her eye shadows into eyeliner. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I was surprised that this was well-rated.  If anything, it made my eyelids more greasy and my makeup ran right off.</li>
    <li> I prefer using cake eyeliner because I have never been able to completely control liquid liner so I purchased this product for the sealer. It really works!! Great for both cake liner and color eye pencil. Now the eye primer, which I did not think I would ever use but figured why not try it out...this blew me away. Since I am a little north of 50, the skin at the inner corners of my eyes is not as firm as it was. As a result, when I apply liner it has a tendency to feather in the corners. No More!! First, I applied the primer and blended it with a makeup sponge. Next the cake liner  went on smoothly and stayed right where applied. Finished with the sealer.  The result, 8 hours later, it looks just like it did when I put it on. AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> I really bought this for the Liner Sealer, which is good because I was unimpressed with the eye primer.  After only 4 hours, my eyeshadow was creasing.  It didn&#x27;t improve the staying power at all.  But, the liner sealer was excellent. It lasted all day, and it didn&#x27;t flake off.  Yet, it was easier to remove than charcoal liner. The liner brush is the skinny foam type, and I just dipped the wet brush in my mineral eyeshadow and mixed it a little to wet the shadow and just applied it to my upper and lower lids like a pen liner.  If you want to have the option of doing any color liner you want, just lightly wash off the liner brush before putting it back in the sealer so you don&#x27;t color the sealer.  This is great, because I can use any of my mineral eye shadows and have a lot of color options.  For the $4 I paid, I really don&#x27;t mind that the eye primer was a bust.  The primer needs to be a lot more oil absorbing to be beneficial.</li>
    <li> I love elf cosmetics, this primer is awesome so far I have gone all day with no creasing or smudging .</li>
    <li> Boy this primer helps keep my eye shadow in place.  I put in on my lids, let it dry for a few minutes and the apply my shadows.  I don&#x27;t get creases, or oily build up and I don&#x27;t need to reapply my shadow.  It STAYS in place!!!!</li>
    <li> I never used the line sealer, I buy it for the eyelid primer. I use eye shadow all the time, every day. Different colors, depending on the time of the day. But even with heavy make-up for the evening, like silver and shimmery black, this makes it stay in place and doesn&#x27;t smudge. I HATE smudged eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a pro, but I get &amp;#34;I love your make-up&amp;#34; compliments all the time. I have round beady eyes (yuck!), so I elongate them with eyeliner AND eye shadow, so a primer is a must for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been buying and re-buying this. Trust me, it works.</li>
    <li> I tested this primer along with every other primer in my collection along my arm for a series of swatches. This one won over all of them for how much it boosted the color. Have not tested for longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the liner sealer much, but I&#x27;ve tested it, and it definitely does makes an eyeliner out of any eyeshadow or pigment you have.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this, but I just don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s an okay product, but neither side is fantastic. Actually, I only used it a couple times, then began ignoring it. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I BROUGHT THIS FOR A PHOTO SHOOT AND THIS WORKED PERFECT. I WILL BUY AGAIN. GREAT PRODUCT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get this product for the primer (though I do use elf primer) I got this for the sealer and it works beautifully! I have pretty oily skin so naturally my eyelids get really oily. I used a maybelline eyestudio 05 Give Me Gold eyeshadow which I applied only as a type of eyeliner with a liner brush I dipped in water, drying off the excess with a towel. After I applied the eyeshadow, I dabbed on the liner sealer and fanned it dry. This was around 11 in the morning. I walked around a lot and it was a sunny day. I went to the beach at night and got back late. At one in the morning my eyeshadow is still perfect. It didn&#x27;t smudge at all! And it&#x27;s so cheap! Worth the purchase even without the primer.</li>
    <li> I would have givin this 5 stars, but i had an allergy sensitivity to the liquid part of this product.</li>
    <li> The eye primer is a great product, but even better, I use it as lip barrier sunscreen.  Excellent multi-purpose concealer, too.  I don&#x27;t really need the liner sealer, otherwise I&#x27;d give it a perfect rating.</li>
    <li> was looking for this for a very long time already! finally found one that works perfectly! a but hard to actually rub on but does the job!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. My eyeshadow stays on all day, no smudges on eyes. I haven&#x27;t tried the other half yet, however it&#x27;s worth it just fort the primer.</li>
    <li> the primer does zero for me &amp; the eyeliner sealer actually smears my eyeliner &amp; makes it look uneven. (have tried w/ many different kinds and brands)</li>
    <li> I like the idea of the eyeshadow liner with the primer, it is the reason I purchased this product. The primer was easy to use and it brightened the color of eyeshadow however it is not long before eyelids look oily with creases. You get what you pay for, I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I do not like this primer as much as the Revlon one I used previously.  I purchased this due to the price.  Unlike other primers that I have used, the eye shadow and liner does not stay on all day.  There are smudges in the crease of my eye almost as if I didn&#x27;t use a primer.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great product!</li>
    <li> I use this product daily before applying my eye shadow. I don&#x27;t use the liner sealer much because I primarily use gel liner, but the few times I used it I realized it erases some of the liner if you don&#x27;t let it dry a bit first. All in all a good product, will buy again.</li>
    <li> I prefer cream primer, but this is a nice (and better priced) alternative to what I&#x27;ve been using.  I have&#x27;t used the lip sealer yet.  The primer hasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
    <li> This was the first primer i have ever tried but i like it so far. It was easier to apply than i was expecting and really made my eyeshadow stay put as well give it more vibrant pigment. As for the liner sealer, i really love making my eyeshadow into eyeliner. It works pretty well, my only complaint is with the applicator. Its so stiff and hard. And it frays at the end making application sloppy as well as making it very difficult to fully clean out the eyeshadow. Im just a beginner with makeup, and this product has made a huge difference for me. I know there&#x27;s better primers out there, but for me this works fine and the price is much more affordable.</li>
    <li> I love the E.L.F products lines and when I found this I was very quick to purchase but after my first  use was disappointed in the staying power.  I have very wide eyes with a very slight droop to the lid and lids are oily.  When I use this I prime, then put setting powder over this prior to putting on my eye shadow.  If I don&#x27;t powder prior to my shadow it will crease and does not last at all.  The liner sealer does work over my waterproof liner.  Liner sealer usually works for my 12-15 hour work day.  I am giving it 3 stars only because it takes extra steps to keep the staying power of the primer, sealer works great.</li>
    <li> I like this eye shadow/liner combo.  I have oily skin though so it looks nice for most part of the day but then my liner does smear.</li>
    <li> The sealer is good, but you have to remember to hold the dispenser with the sealer at the bottom and the primer at the top because the sealer runs out if you forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primer is OK, but pulls at the eyelid tissue when you put it on.</li>
    <li> I have trouble with creases. This did literally nothing to improve that (I have a variety of quality eyeshadow, so it&#x27;s nit that). I do have oily skin, so maybe it works better for others. I found the primer was also a bit too waxy and didn&#x27;t go on very easily.&lt;br /&gt;I kept it to use the sealer. I often use shadow for lid liner to match my look and the sealer works great! Stays all day.</li>
    <li> The primer barely stays on for more than two hours. Its horrible and fades away so quickly!! I wish i didn&#x27;t waste money on this. Im upset with the liner sealer as well it stays on for all of maybe an hour and thats all. It burned my eyes at that too. Again very upset with an amazon makeup purchase!!</li>
    <li> Love this product - easy to use.  The liner is not that great as it dried up rather quickly and it will leak out leaving a sticky mess so store it standing up with the liner part on the bottom so it doesn&#x27;t drip out.  Otherwise, for the money it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.  Leaves my eye makeup and concealer in place all day no creasing!</li>
    <li> This item has two uses. Eye lid primer and eyeliner sealer. I am 35 and starting to see aging around my eyes. Eyelid primer twist like lipstick. Pulls my eyelids when putting on. Also the eyelid primer is flesh tone, I prefer a yellow tint primer. The yellow undertone goes well with my light skin tone. Eye liner is awesome. The sealer side turns my favorite eye shadow into liquid liner. Eye liner is still on after 13 hours!!</li>
    <li> This is a great concept - bought eye primer/liner sealer for $3 at Target.  Great stuff!  The eyeliner works great - just dip into your favorite color eyeshadow and you&#x27;ve got your eyeliner-of-the-day!  Easy to apply, lasts all day!  Great price too!!</li>
    <li> Yes, I said it.  In my bag of makeup this is the absolute best product I have.  I use the eyelid primer at 3:30 in the morning and after a long, and generally hot shift at work and an afternoon filled with running errands and an exercise class, my eye makeup is still vibrant and on my eyes not under them.  But the REAL gem is the liner sealer.  You can use it to make a liner out of any eye shadow.  In the last couple of years, I have developed dry eyes, and the result is that my eyes water for what seems like hours in the morning trying to moisten themselves.  As a result, any liner I put on my lower lashes just washes off.  Now I use the liner sealer and at the end of the day, I STILL have liner on my lower lashes.  It&#x27;s a small thing, but it makes me happy. I heartily recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Completely amazed with this. Although, learning how to do it is a bit difficult without instructions of some sort. The eye primer was self explanatory but using the line sealer with eyeshadow was a little difficult. Awesome stuff though. I figured out the easiest way for me and it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I was super excited about the concept of this little thing, but I was let down when it showed up.  First, the concealer is a lot more yellow than it shows in the photo.  I prefer more of a pinkish concealer.  Second, the eyeliner sealer idea is a great concept, but doesn&#x27;t work very well.  You are supposed to dip it in eye-shadow to create any color liner you wish.  However, the brush is so thin, they liner is barely noticeable.  If you are looking for an extremely subtle, natural, look with VERY thin liner lines, you may like this.  Otherwise, just get a regular liner.</li>
    <li> Both of these products are good, I&#x27;m not sure why they&#x27;re attached... but for the price, who cares. Buy it if you want either one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because Target was out of the ELF primer I had been using. The stick primer here works well, and I maybe even like it more than the cream primer I was looking for. There is no drying time with this product. You can buy cheapie eyeshadows, and they don&#x27;t fade with this primer. There&#x27;s good amount of it in the tube also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner sealer is a really unusual product. It allows you to use an eyeshadow as eyeliner.. and it works a lot better than just using water or something. It does not leave goo in the eyeshadow container either. It is a pointy felt tip-like thing... gives a nice line. Could be useful if you want an unusual eyeliner color or want it to match your eyeshadow. Only small problem is that it is sorta hard to switch colors; If you use it for black on Monday, you&#x27;ll have to do some clean up to use it with turquoise on Tuesday. So maybe buy a couple.. and give the primer a try.</li>
    <li> The eye primer isn&#x27;t anything special.  I have oily eyelids and the primer works okay.  The primer isn&#x27;t as soft as I would like, so you have to rub a bit on your lids.  The liner sealer on the other hand is amazing!! If elf sold just the sealer I would purchase it for sure (there are better eye primers out there).  I can use the sealer, on as I mentioned my oily skin, and it will stay on all day.  I&#x27;m serious about all day.  I work 12 hour days and I&#x27;ll use it on my upper and lower lids, and it will not move.  I actually have to you a bit stronger of a make-up remover when I use the sealer.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> meh. NYX milk is better.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and works well.  The only negative is the design of the applicator.  It is easy to spill the liner sealer.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely amazing! To be honest, I haven&#x27;t even checked out the primer side yet. My favorite lid primer is currently Too Faced Cosmetics &amp;#34;Shadow Insurance,&amp;#34; and I haven&#x27;t seen a need to switch. The real star here is the liner sealer!!! I am a professional makeup artist, and why on earth I didn&#x27;t know about this until now is beyond me. I use this not only to seal liners but to make my own liner colors. Dip it in any shadow you want, and poof! Bright pink, red, purple, blue.. liner in any color you want! It&#x27;s perfect when you want a more muted liner color and all you have is black and brown, or when you want something really vibrant to match your shadow. The idea of coordinating liner with shadow is brilliant, and I love it! I have gotten so many compliments on my crazy liner colors, especially the vibrant cobalt blue I&#x27;ve made with loose pigments! Seriously, check it out. It&#x27;s cheap enough that you won&#x27;t feel bad if you don&#x27;t like it or won&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> It is very oily. I wear the primer to prevent the buildup of my eyeshadow, but it does the opposite. I am just going back to using my powder foundation as a primer. It works much better</li>
    <li> Lllllloooooovvvvveeee......really works!</li>
    <li> I am disappointed. I purchased this item primarily for the liner sealer, and it has failed each of the 3 times I tried it. To the trash it goes!</li>
    <li> The primer is actually very good and I like the freedom to experiment with different colors for eyeliners. It actually does lock the color in and the applicator makes it easy to draw a line on your lid. Just be sure to wipe off the applicator after each use to prevent contaminating the liquid with different colors.</li>
    <li> I used to use a product by Benefit to seal my eyeliner and mascara. It was discontinued so I&#x27;ve been trying other things. This might work ok but the applicator for the sealer is super stiff and hard, so it takes off the eyeliner I just applied. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> It does help to keep eye make-up on a little longer, not as long as I would like it to, but it is better with it then without it.</li>
    <li> The eyeliner sealer doesn&#x27;t do much for me--I still get raccoon eyes, like I ALWAYS do with eyeliner. So that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars. But the eyelid primer is great. It&#x27;s thicker than most eyelid primers, so it stays in place and I think it works much better. A friend just asked me why my eyeliner never creases and lasts such a long time.</li>
    <li> This did not seal my eyeliner and last all day.  Terrible product.</li>
    <li> I love it! no more dark eyelids or faded eyeshadow. The only counter effect is that It does not keep oily eyelids from happening.</li>
    <li> This little item is like finding a diamond in coal...It turns your dry eye shadows into eyeliner! And it is great for my sensitive skin around my eyes, which is just dang AWESOME!!! Most liquid eyeliners irritates my eyes, causing them to tear, which washes away the eyeliner. But with this LITTLE BEAUTY PRODUCT SAVED MY EYES...</li>
    <li> Terrible quality of make up, do not buy!</li>
    <li> My wife likes it and the shipping is really fast</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Nothing to write home about</li>
    <li> i have terribly greasy eyelids and loved UD primer. within 2 hours it smudged.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m at that age where my lids droop a little and eyeliner smears like a raccoon hit by a semi.....was ready to give up after trying just about every kind of eyeliner and I don&#x27;t looks so good without it! I personally use the primer then put powder over it then apply gel liner then the sealer....they could start a religion with this stuff!!</li>
