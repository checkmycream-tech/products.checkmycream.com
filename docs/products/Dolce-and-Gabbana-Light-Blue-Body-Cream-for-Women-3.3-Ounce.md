      <li>Nice, soft fragrance.  </li>
      <li>good scent like the blue one!</li>
      <li>It is not thick like how most lotions are.</li>
      <li>Fast and easy</li>
      <li>makes skin very soft and she loves it also i love the way she smells with this lotion and feels</li>
      <li>Oh I just love this light blue by Dolce Gabana.  </li>
      <li>A fresh scent.</li>
      <li>Pretty good compared with its price, the fragance does not last enough on you though it was not a bad deal.</li>
      <li>The jury is still out on this as i&#x27;m just trying this suggestion today for the first time.  </li>
      <li>Such a great fragrance coming out of the heavy winter.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>thanks so much dolce and gab  </li>
      <li>So i apply the Light Blue lotion and then spritz the Light Blue fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I wish it was available in a larger size.</li>
      <li>So no matter how much you put on its not to aggressive.</li>
      <li>The smell is long lasting and stays with you all day so elegant !</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m enjoying the fragrance and so other people</li>
      <li>The only reason i bought this is because the Light Blue EDT i have doesn&#x27;t hold a scent on my body for more than ten minutes.</li>
      <li>The scent does not stay with you for long and the cream is so light it does not do anything for your skin.</li>
      <li>It goes on the skin so smooth and lasts for a long time.</li>
      <li>It is classic, modern, soft and always get compliments when worn.  </li>
      <li>Secondly, if you leave the tube standing the amount of lotion in the tube hits right below the word Dolce &amp; Gabbana.  </li>
      <li>23$ dollars is not a small money for a 3.3 oz lotion.</li>
      <li>I thought the tube was going to be larger as much as I paid  </li>
      <li>wow what are you wearing........</li>
      <li>So far it is working well for my wife.  </li>
      <li>When layered it really lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>First, the tube is much smaller than what I had expected for a 3.3Fl oz.  </li>

    <li> My wife just loves this stuff and the smell is not strong at all compared to perfume sprays. So no matter how much you put on its not to aggressive. Body Creams are the way to go I think.</li>
    <li> Love the scent of this and the application is really nice feeling.  I leave it in my gym bag for after showers...it moisterizes and saves the trouble of having perfume that may break.</li>

    <li> I love the sent.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a quite a long time.  Reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order arrived quickly!</li>
    <li> I love this scent, but it fades quickly.  I would buy it again, and probably will.  Best smelling fragrance around now.</li>
    <li> makes skin very soft and she loves it also i love the way she smells with this lotion and feels</li>
    <li> I received this with in two days of purchase. This is my favorite scent but I had not tried the lotion before, but I love it now. It&#x27;s light and airy and does not have the sticky effect like most perfume lotions, I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Price was phenomenal &amp; service, impeccable!</li>
    <li> Few things which I am very disappointed.  First, the tube is much smaller than what I had expected for a 3.3Fl oz.  Secondly, if you leave the tube standing the amount of lotion in the tube hits right below the word Dolce &amp; Gabbana.  Third is what disappointed me the most, the lotion is very watery.  The scent does not last.  Dolce and Gabbana is my favorite scent and I love it so much, I thought the lotion would last like the perfume, but I am very disappointed in this purchase. Definitely would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Oh I just love this light blue by Dolce Gabana.  I wish i could order once a month that is how much I love this product.  If there is ever a combination set please advertise.  LOL</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this on me. :)</li>
    <li> Sometimes I get fooled when I order on line: the product looks like something that it isn&#x27;t...but this was the real deal at a great price!</li>
    <li> The only reason i bought this is because the Light Blue EDT i have doesn&#x27;t hold a scent on my body for more than ten minutes. No lie! I was told that layering might be my solution.  So i apply the Light Blue lotion and then spritz the Light Blue fragrance.  The jury is still out on this as i&#x27;m just trying this suggestion today for the first time.  But the lotion has a oily, sticky texture to it, which i&#x27;m not that crazy about. So i only gave it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I loved the light fragrance in cream form to layer with the fragrance.  I would have liked a&lt;br /&gt;thicker cream, but since it was supposed to be &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; and refreshing it works fine! s Definitely would recommend it for summer.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent! When layered it really lasts a long time. I wish it was available in a larger size. So I don&#x27;t need to keep ordering it.</li>
    <li> Good product.  So far it is working well for my wife.  We both like the scent.  We ca recommend it.</li>
    <li> Pretty good compared with its price, the fragance does not last enough on you though it was not a bad deal. I think iwould try another fragance. I think this is not original.</li>
    <li> Bought it to gift someone and had good words about this product.</li>
    <li> Package arrived on time. The problem is its almost half emptied...its not new. I am very disappointed.  I want refund. 23$ dollars is not a small money for a 3.3 oz lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this body cream! It is not thick like how most lotions are. And it smells great. But the scent does not last too long</li>
    <li> Nice, soft fragrance.  Purchased 2 - one as a Christmas gift.</li>
