      <li>Pleasantly scented, clean feeling.</li>
      <li>This Shea butter is by far the best I ever had!</li>
      <li>but I LOVE it so much more than what I&#x27;ve been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>USES: I love using this as a lotion for my body.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love this.</li>
      <li>Overall I think this is the best one.</li>
      <li>I love the way this leaves my skin feeling.  </li>
      <li>Then, I bought two more jars with plans to give them away to relatives.</li>
      <li>I sleep better too because my legs don&#x27;t ache after applying.  </li>
      <li>and well just feels better.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>feel confident during the day.</li>
      <li>and I thought that it was more of a creme (for some reason), Shea Butter irritates my eyes</li>
      <li>yes you might consider coconut butter smells better.  </li>
      <li>It makes your skin so smooth and you literally feel it soaking in to your skin!</li>
      <li>For the price,the shipping should be more cared for.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought some of this through another web site, but this is a great product and it&#x27;s truly high quality.  </li>
      <li>It makes my skin so soft and although I did not get good results with using it on my natural hair, it does an excellent job on my skin.  </li>
      <li>So therefore I&#x27;m willing to pay to get Wise&#x27;s Owl Organics each month and maybe send some as a gift.</li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome and definitely helps areas that are affected to heal quickly.</li>
      <li>, I really appreciate the USDA organic, Fair Trade, and chemical free glass.  </li>
      <li>I gave this product 3 stars, however, because this product works fine as a moisturizer for my legs and arms and</li>
      <li>I loved that I could notice a difference in how soft my hands and feet were after just one application!</li>
      <li>However, the truth is, I liked it so much, that I&#x27;ve kept them for myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin feels fabulous.</li>
      <li>I like that it&#x27;s fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t make me feel oily.</li>
      <li>This would be a perfect 5 stars if they could give it to us for 8oz at half the price, while keeping everything else the same (gift box, chemical free glass, USDA, Fair Trade, ECOcert) .  </li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin and this has been the best thing so far for it.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Whish they would think more logical about this.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Why look for shea butter rich moisturizers when you can&lt;br /&gt;buy  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and takes awhile to be absorbed.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call it sweet or unscented and</li>
      <li>I totally recommend Wise Owl Organics</li>
      <li>Even though I think it is best for the body and secondary use as hair sealant.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Pleased to say that in one week they are much softer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve discovered pure shea butter is the absolute best thing for my ridiculously dry skin.</li>
      <li>I ordered wise owl organic shea butter and no longer suffer from dry flaky skin.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>Have been using Shea Butter a few weeks now and am seeing great results.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes on light and really absorbs into your skin.</li>
      <li>you might not care for this one, but for me anyways the smell is worth the ease of use and creamier product.</li>
      <li>Very nice product, left skin extremely soft.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs pretty quickly and has long-lasting moisture.  </li>
      <li>Goes on really greasy, and doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly, so plan to wear pajamas if you&#x27;re going to sit on furniture.  </li>
      <li>and when I used it I found that it had a smooth texture that I wasn&#x27;t able to find in other shea butter.</li>
      <li>pretty great.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d heard there was a difference between western shea butter and eastern shea butter, so I&#x27;d thought I try this eastern shea butter to see if it worked any better.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve found this to be the most lasting moisturizer on the market.</li>
      <li>the company&#x27;s communication was first rate.</li>
      <li>received my first two jars as a gift...</li>
      <li>I can tell it will last a long time and do a great job.</li>
      <li>This was my first attempt at trying out pure Shea butter -</li>
      <li>It goes on extra rich but then absorbs right into your skin.  </li>
      <li>But the good news is that just a tiny amount goes a LONG way.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much at all for the area.</li>
      <li>/&gt;OVERALL:  I really like this</li>
      <li>It really helps with my cracked feet.</li>
      <li>: It is only 4oz and can fit into your hand.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>It is in a chemical free glass with the symbols and writings on 2 giant stickers.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only ever had it mixed into a lotion of some kind.</li>
      <li>Other than that I&#x27;m really satisfied with this</li>
      <li>Another great thing about it is that my skin doesn&#x27;t dry back out until I shower the next day.</li>
      <li>The western butter that I bought was grey and kind of grainy.</li>
      <li>- it is a high quality product that is very healing.</li>
      <li>This shea butter is really high quality.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use it on my face.  A terrific healing moisturizer.  Why look for shea butter rich moisturizers when you can&lt;br /&gt;buy  Wise Owl Organic 100 % Shea Butter?  Pleasantly scented, clean feeling.</li>
    <li> This works startlingly better than the West African shea butter I&#x27;d previously purchased, definitely well worth the extra cost!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome and definitely helps areas that are affected to heal quickly.</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and myself have very sensitive dry skin and the first week of using this product I noticed amazing results. It helped soothe and heal our irritated skin that was due to harsh weather.  I highly recommend this product to anyone and will continue to use it daily.</li>
    <li> This Shea butter is by far the best I ever had! It makes your skin so smooth and you literally feel it soaking in to your skin! It works wonders!!! Good for strech marks also!</li>
    <li> Very nice product, left skin extremely soft.  Will buy it again.  Like that it is organic certified.</li>
    <li> For my very dry skin, this is the best of the best!  A small amount goes a long way and my skin is softer.  Also, it FEELS sooooo good.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cream!  My hands have been dry and cracked this winter and this moisturizes them so well.  A little goes a long way, so the jar will last you a long time.  It absorbs pretty quickly and has long-lasting moisture.  It&#x27;s also really pure, the only ingredient is 100% organic Ugandan Shea Butter.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS!!  My skin feels fabulous. I use it on my body during the day and on my face at night. I was a bit shocked at the size of the jar when it arrived, as I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the ounces when I ordered it. But the good news is that just a tiny amount goes a LONG way. I would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> For the price,the shipping should be more cared for.&lt;br /&gt;My jar came completely broken in to pieces as if someone dropped it and then tossed it in the box. Very dangerous btw:/ I could of cut my self really bad..&lt;br /&gt;They did sent a replacement jar but expect me to ship the other jar back..which I found ironic since I have to endanger my self again..packing the broken glass and shipp it. I did add some stickers and warned them about the danger of cutting them selfs...&lt;br /&gt;Whish they would think more logical about this.&lt;br /&gt;The Shea butter seems really good.I am allergic to most oils and creams,so I tried this on my knuckles and elbows that had gotten a bit dry and rough. Pleased to say that in one week they are much softer.</li>
    <li> This cream is excellent!  It goes on extra rich but then absorbs right into your skin.  I use it everywhere, especially on those extra dry spots like my heels and elbows.  It has a very natural smell, no perfumes or fragrances.  I totally recommend Wise Owl Organics - it is a high quality product that is very healing.</li>
    <li> Love it.works great.I will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Wow! I&#x27;ve been using 100% Shea Butter for awhile now but this one is excellent.  I usually check items I order carefully and I thought that it was more of a creme (for some reason), Shea Butter irritates my eyes and so I don&#x27;t apply it to my face and I wash my hands after applying and I was hoping that a creme base would not do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed that this wasn&#x27;t a creme... BUT! This brand is melts easier and absorbs easier. I have no idea what they&#x27;ve done to make it this way but I LOVE it so much more than what I&#x27;ve been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will order again - very happy :)</li>
    <li> It goes on smoothly and takes awhile to be absorbed.  I like that it&#x27;s organic with no added fragrance.  I would give it 5 stars except that I think the price is high compared with other brands.</li>
    <li> USES: I love using this as a lotion for my body.  You can also use this for a face lotion, hand lotion, and as a hair sealant.  Even though I think it is best for the body and secondary use as hair sealant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONTENT: It is very soft when you put your finger in it and it appears to be solid.  Once it is on your hand/finger for 5 secs it immediately melts into oily liquid.  My body definitely feels moist after I put it on.  I recommend to do it overnight after hopping out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SMELL:  At first it has a little bit of a bold, nutty, and ground smell but it goes away especially overnight.  I wouldn&#x27;t call it sweet or unscented and yes you might consider coconut butter smells better.  I don&#x27;t mind since it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COLOR: It has a light white, yellow, cream color.&lt;br /&gt;SIZE: It is only 4oz and can fit into your hand.  Depending on how much you use it, it can last at least 15 days to maximum of 45 days.&lt;br /&gt;CONTAINER:  It is in a chemical free glass with the symbols and writings on 2 giant stickers.  It does come in a gift box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:  I really like this but I will be honest and admit it is on the expensive side for how much you get.  This would be a perfect 5 stars if they could give it to us for 8oz at half the price, while keeping everything else the same (gift box, chemical free glass, USDA, Fair Trade, ECOcert) .  Other than that I&#x27;m really satisfied with this, I really appreciate the USDA organic, Fair Trade, and chemical free glass.  So therefore I&#x27;m willing to pay to get Wise&#x27;s Owl Organics each month and maybe send some as a gift.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve discovered pure shea butter is the absolute best thing for my ridiculously dry skin. I&#x27;m talking seriously dry skin that cracks and bleeds and is not only painful but disgusting. I&#x27;d heard there was a difference between western shea butter and eastern shea butter, so I&#x27;d thought I try this eastern shea butter to see if it worked any better. It has a smell that is earthy, a little off-putting, but not horrid. I didn&#x27;t notice any odor with the western stuff. However this eastern butter is creamier, smooths easier and well just feels better. The western butter that I bought was grey and kind of grainy. You had to heat it with a hair dryer for a few minutes to get it to spread well. It came in a plastic jar and well, I sorta worried about chemicals not necessarily good for you, being released with the heated plastic. I like that this comes in a glass jar. If you are very sensitive to earthy smells you might not care for this one, but for me anyways the smell is worth the ease of use and creamier product. I will buy this one again even though it&#x27;s a little more expensive. Overall I think this is the best one.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this. It goes on nicely. I have super sensitive skin and this has been the best thing so far for it. Essential Oils also blend well with it. (For the essential oils; Mixing in hand one application at a time not the entire jar)</li>
    <li> I am loving this product! I have used it four nights in a row and I can tell a difference in my skin already. I have been complimented by a friend that said my skin looked great. I am recommending this to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> WooHoo, this is a moisturizer!  I love the way this leaves my skin feeling.  Is expensive, but my skin is worth it.  Have been rubbing on my legs after showering at night.  Goes on really greasy, and doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly, so plan to wear pajamas if you&#x27;re going to sit on furniture.  But when you wake up next morning, your skin will feel so soft and silky.  I sleep better too because my legs don&#x27;t ache after applying.  Am getting ready to order second jar.  Doesn&#x27;t smell great, but not bad.  After applying, there is no odor at all.  Am very glad I tried this.</li>
    <li> I have a tendency towards very dry skin, especially in the winter. I ordered wise owl organic shea butter and no longer suffer from dry flaky skin. I love this product. I use it everywhere, every day. It&#x27;s great for everything. Before this product, shaving my legs resulted in itchy skin. Now I apply wise owl Shea butter after shaving and that problem has been solved. I&#x27;ve tried other similar products but I&#x27;ve found this to be the most lasting moisturizer on the market. You can&#x27;t go wrong ordering this. The ingredients are quality and the customer service excellent. I will always have this product. I&#x27;m addicted to my new skin, thanks to this product!!</li>
    <li> Difficult to use but the shea butter great as always</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last week.  Unfortunately, I am not able to use it for what I intentionally purchased it for (as a facial moisturizer).  I developed blackheads on my forehead and cheeks and cysts along my jaw line after using this product even though shea butter is supposed to be non-comedogenic.  I gave this product 3 stars, however, because this product works fine as a moisturizer for my legs and arms and the company&#x27;s communication was first rate.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It will last a really long time. You don&#x27;t have to use much at all for the area. I like that it&#x27;s fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t make me feel oily. Another great thing about it is that my skin doesn&#x27;t dry back out until I shower the next day. This product also has helped heal the area I applied it to.</li>
    <li> Have been using Shea Butter a few weeks now and am seeing great results. My skin isn&#x27;t as dry. The Shea Butter is making a difference. Am very satisfied with product and do recommend it.</li>
    <li> Unbelievably goodness!  It makes my skin so soft and although I did not get good results with using it on my natural hair, it does an excellent job on my skin.  It is quite expensive so I am using it sparingly.</li>
    <li> This is the best Shea Butter that there is!! I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty great.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on light and really absorbs into your skin. I use it at night and it never comes off in my sleep</li>
    <li> Love this product! Received as a gift and love the way it makes my skin feel! :)</li>
    <li> I love this product! I received this as a gift from my daughter. I use it everyday on my cuticles and it has made a huge difference on my hands and nails.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend bought me this and I am&lt;br /&gt;Hooked the quality is amazing! I highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> This Shea Butter is great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my first two jars as a gift... one I gave to my girlfriend and the other I started using. Then, I bought two more jars with plans to give them away to relatives. However, the truth is, I liked it so much, that I&#x27;ve kept them for myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve very active outside in the cold, dry winter air, and this product has totally saved my dry skin!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Wise Owl Organics!! You&#x27;re a lifesaver!!</li>
    <li> I was searching for a clean shea butter for my severely dry skin.  I came across this on amazon and love it!  It rubs in very nice and feels amazing.  I even received a personal phone call from the company asking me about my experience with it.  That&#x27;s customer service!</li>
    <li> My face looks awesome! I don&#x27;t get oily and it helps w acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;I feel confident during the day. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> This was my first attempt at trying out pure Shea butter - I&#x27;ve only ever had it mixed into a lotion of some kind. I apply lotion to my hands and feet every night before bed so I started using East African Shea Butter instead. It has a slight gritty feel that was different from my usual lotion but once I got used to that, I loved it. I loved that I could notice a difference in how soft my hands and feet were after just one application! It really helps with my cracked feet. I don&#x27;t have to constantly apply lotion all day anymore! I can rub just a tiny bit of East African Shea Butter on my hands and they feel soft again and without the greasy feeling of lotion. I only wish I had tried this product earlier! I can tell it will last a long time and do a great job.</li>
    <li> feels nice on your skin</li>
    <li> This shea butter is really high quality. I could see it when I opened it and when I used it I found that it had a smooth texture that I wasn&#x27;t able to find in other shea butter. And it&#x27;s organic which is always a bonus. I highly recommend this product. High quality at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> I bought some of this through another web site, but this is a great product and it&#x27;s truly high quality.  This product sparked my obsession with free trade,organic, and cold pressed shea nilotica; while reading about it I recently ran across one that lotion crafter sells on their site for $14 a pound and makes my pocketbook a lot happier.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product! I have used it for one week and I see a huge difference in my rough, dry hands.</li>
