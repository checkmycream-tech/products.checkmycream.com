<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is not by Paul Sebastian. No where on box nor on bottle does it say Paul Sebastian. It also does not smell good. Smells tinny or like alcohol. Cheap and falsely advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always very happy and satisfied with anything I get from Amazon</li>
    <li> exceeded expectations on how it stays on and lingers on my skin.  Smells fresh, clean, and crisp.  I LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Awesome!!!!  My wife wears this fragrance and loves it.</li>
    <li> Love it very clean smelling.</li>
    <li> My forever favorite!!  Always get compliments when I wear this fragrance!</li>
    <li> This is very hard to find locally... shipment was very swift, and price was good too.... so convenient to order from Amazon...thanks.</li>
    <li> The writing on the bottle pictured on Amazon is in script. The bottle that was shipped to me has block letters on the bottle.  The scent is different from other bottles I&#x27;ve purchased in the store.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000XEBDK4 Casual By Paul Sebastian For Women. Fine Parfum Spray  4.0 Oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as a replacement for an original bottle of Casual. It is definitely not the same product. It has a strong alcohol odor, not the sweet talcum fragrance as the original. In addition, the color is tannish not clear. My wife was very dissappointed and will not wear it. She uses it as a bathroom air freshener.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product unless you need to freshen up your bathroom.</li>
    <li> A fruity &amp;#34;white Shoulders&amp;#34; scent.  Get compliments all the time on the &amp;#34;Casual!&amp;#34;  Love this spray!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Casual for years and this is the second bottle that has almost NO scent.  It had the scent when I opened it, but by the third day of using it, it was gone.  What&#x27;s with this product?  I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to get this fragrance for the price I got it for.</li>
    <li> This scent is a staple in our house  It is so light and fresh still the fragrance lasts a long time</li>
    <li> My wife likes it, so I am happy.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find Casual on Amazon-----this has been my favorite for years and has become very hard to  find in the stores. What a disappointment----this smells nothing like the original Casual. The bottle I got smells   more like coconut oil than the original light Casual sent. I don&#x27;t usually return but I think this one will have  to go back. Very very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful fragrance.  Clean and fresh.  Get a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used casual for years its my one &amp; only spray and a lot of people have asked what i was wearing  i love it</li>
    <li> Casual by Paul Sebastian is my grandmother&#x27;s favorite perfume.  My Mother usually buys it at a store, but I thought I would save my Mother $40, and buy Gram her favorite gift for 1/2 the price at Amazon.  I called Gram to wish her a Happy New Year yesterday and she told me the perfume has \\&quot;no smell\\&quot;.  This is a problem since she uses it for the nice fragrance and gets many compliments for how good she smells at her personal care home.  It is useless and I can&#x27;t return it because it is a liquid.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have to make a trip to a store and get to my grandmother during the snowy winter months.  What a disappointment!  Was the price reduced because the product is inferior?  Is Amazon selling old merchandise?  This was a waste of time and money.  Buyer beware!  Why is this product still being sold?</li>
    <li> I have been using this perfume for years!!! It s my most favorite and I m so grateful Amazon still has it.... I keep a stock if it so every time I use a bottle I replace it right away for fear someday it will no longer be available.  I get compliments on it all the time, everywhere I go!!😄</li>
    <li> Good clean smell.  Often asked what I have on.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite perfume for Women.  I have been wearing this perfume for a very long time.  Sometimes it is hard to find in the store as many of the major stores do not carry this item anymore.  This fragrance compliments me and my chemistry very well.(lol) I get so many compliments on this fragrance when I wear it,,,it turns a lot of heads and I am asked a lot, what is that fragrance you&#x27;re wearing!!!!!  When I do see it in stores, I buy them all!!!!! When I can&#x27;t find it in the stores, I can always find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this cologne several times before and was VERY pleased, but this time, the cologne was a strange color and didn&#x27;t smell the same at all. I didn&#x27;t realize I couldn&#x27;t return it if anything was wrong with it. I work hard for my money and this was just throwing money out the window. Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy anything else from Amazon again.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance! Get a lot of compliments!</li>
    <li> This parfum spray  has a nice clean soft sent perfect the summer or all year round it&#x27;s no the same as the original but very close  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is the only fragrance I have worn for many years and got compliments all the time. I have had a hard time finding it in stores and was excited to find it available online but skeptical. I took a chance even with the reviews. It really does not smell the same and I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is one of my My favorite perfumes it was easy to order and it was sent to me in a reasonable time, I ordered two for myself and received one as a Christmas gift  now I have three and I can have one everywhere I need it.</li>
    <li> My wife recently made this purchase to replace an almost-empty 4-year old bottle of the same.  When it arrived, she asked me to compare the scent of the two bottles.  Although the scent was the same fragerence, the newer bottle smelled somewhat weaker...noticeably weaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it three times in the past month, she also discovered that the essence didn&#x27;t last for more than a minute or so..... I concur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is all that I wear and get compliments every time that I were it.</li>
    <li> Love it !!  I have so many people ask what I am wearing , so it smells like you just stepped out of the shower</li>
    <li> This perfume is fabulous! Since this perfume has been discontinued I was concerned that the fragrance would not be the same... It was spot on!</li>
    <li> Smell doesn&#x27;t even last 1 hour...</li>
    <li> I also like &amp;#34;Designs&amp;#34;  by Paul Sebastian.</li>
    <li> delivery on time, good product.</li>
    <li> Great delicate and unoffensive scent. It stays on longer than most perfumes. Too bad this can no longer be found on the store shelves.</li>
    <li> This is NOT the old, original, casual perfume. Others have made the same statement here and they are correct. Also Amazon will NOT give refunds or credit on this product. I did find the original scent at perfume.com.</li>
    <li> I have loved the fragrance for years but these days the aroma does not last.&lt;br /&gt;In the past one could spray this on and it would last for hours.  Not anymore!!</li>
    <li> Love Love this light airy fragrance. Never disappoints!</li>
    <li> I recieved this perfume in a timely  manner well packaged and in good condition. Casual is a light parfum that has a clean odor and people comment on the fresh smell.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this fine par fume.  It has a sweet, light, but NOT over-powerful aroma, and I receive frequent compliments on it when I am out.  When you first spray it on, there is a slight alcohol odor which quickly disappears.  It is in a pretty bottle and sprays nicely.  The scent lasts a long time, proven by the fact that I can still smell it on my clothes the following day.  I spent a long time trying to find a lovely scent like this; one that has a floral aroma without heaviness.</li>
    <li> I have used Casual for years and like it very much. It has not changed!</li>
    <li> Beautiful, light fragrance.....!!!  I have used half the bottle already!!!</li>
    <li> I wonderful scent it keeps you coming back to buy more! I had the bottle for two year and I&#x27;m only half way through it. Nice design of the bottle and cap. I good deal for your monies. It&#x27;s light not too over powering and it&#x27;s a scent for all ages. I feel like a real women when I spray this on. I can&#x27;t say nothing bad about Paul Sebastian they have made the is perfume since the early 1990&#x27;s. Thanks Amazon for still selling this product and I hope you don&#x27;t stop selling it.</li>
    <li> I have an old bottle with just a small amount left in it from over 10 years ago. The label on the bottom of what I received is the same (different lot numbers though) so this is not a knock-off. It&#x27;s the real thing! It smells exactly like it should.</li>
    <li> I get a lot of compliments on this perfume.  Years ago I could buy it a Meier &amp; Frank and I always loved it.</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d on time and as described. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance.  Smells clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> I have been buying Casual for many years this is the best cologne out there!! If you have not tries this give it a chance! Buy it!</li>
    <li> I&amp;#34;ve been using this perfume for five or more years  and love it everytime I get many compliments of it and is the only when i use , I would be lost if it was taken of market</li>
    <li> I love this scent, it is so fresh. People stop me to ask what perfume I&#x27;m wearing. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I get stopped all the time by strangers (&amp;friends) asking me what perfume I&#x27;m wearing because it smells so good!</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t quite smell as good as my old bottle.  Not sure where I can buy the authentic Casual perfume, but I am disappointed.  I love my old Casual...</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom- she loves it!  The fragrance is very fresh and long-lasting.  Great price, and shipped quickly.  I will always reorder for her when she runs low.</li>
    <li> very nice wife loves it</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law &amp;#34;s favorite perfume!  It came just in time for her birthday!</li>
    <li> I would definately buy this product again it was exactly what I wanted thank you...I am going to  suggest to my sister to order this also.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite perfume i will be purchasing more in the very near future- thanks you this product awesome</li>
    <li> Perfect fragrance and unlike Perfumania  stores the price was right!  This is a great buy that I would recommend to all of my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I received my pkg expeditiously. It was wrapped very well. I will purchase my items again in the future and the prices are gr8t. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This is not the same Casual perfume that I have bought for years. Same bottle but not a good scent. I requested a return.</li>
    <li> Clean, crisp, like soap... That&#x27;s what people say.  Men always comment on how good I smell.  Lasting and great quality fragrance that&#x27;s perfect for every day and any season.  Nothing else even comes close!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  It is soft and clean and fresh.  I like to wear it every day.  Perfect for t-shirt and jeans kind of day!</li>
    <li> I love casual and have been wearing it for years. I can not tell you how many compliments I get on it. It is not a strong smelling cologne which I love. I don&#x27;t want to walk into a restaurant and have someone get sick from the smell why they are eating. This cologne is just the opposite. I have people coming up to me asking me what cologne I am wearing. I love this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other colognes and nothing compares to the light refreshing smell of CASUAL.</li>
    <li> Good fragrance for women nice smell.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and usually have found it at Marshall&#x27;s. Amazon had it for a better price and it was delivered quickly!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like a strong perfume and this is a very nice, clean smell and I get compliments on it all the time...have been wearing this perfume for years.....it  is an excellent price, too!  highly recommend the seller for their service and product.</li>
    <li> I buy my Casual from Perfumania.  I&#x27;ve been buying it from there, for years now.  I have personally never had any issues.  Though if I did, I would definitely take it back.  But every bottle I&#x27;ve ever bought of Casual, from this store, has been absolutely fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells wonderful and it&#x27;s a soft smell.  Nothing harsh at all.  I&#x27;ve had many compliments over the years.  I highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you concerned (understandably so) about getting the \\&quot;real thing,\\&quot; I would recommend either one of two options:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1).  Get this from a department store (Yes, it may be a bit more, but that&#x27;s ok)&lt;br /&gt;2).  Go to Perfumania&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be very tricky, buying this on Amazon, or ebay or one of those outlets.  I would definitely go the department store or Perfumania, avenue.</li>
    <li> This parfum is getting really hard to find in stores so when I came across it on Amazon I had to purchase immediately! So glad I did . . .</li>
    <li> This is my and my husbands favorite. Amazon is the only place we can find it for a great deal. It smells great. Isn&#x27;t strong very soft smelling. Love it. My husband doesn&#x27;t like anything else for me but this.</li>
    <li> It is the only fragance she wears and at your price I was able to supply her with it for a while. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The smell of this perfume Casual,by Paul Sebastian is not the same as the last bottle I purchased.It has a musky scent, where my last bottle was a sweet scent.I will not by this on line again. Very disappointing!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this cologne for 10 years and expect to use it another 10 years.  It has such a fresh fragrance and I get compliments when I wear it.  I do not feel dressed until I spray with Casual.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite.I get more compliments with this fragrance than any other I have.</li>
    <li> Great price!  Great fragrance!!  So glad I can still get it online.</li>
    <li> Smells light and beautiful</li>
    <li> One of my all time  favorite summer scents &amp; I  can&#x27;t wait for it&#x27;s delivery.  I have been stopped over and over again  and asked what  fragrance I&#x27;m wearing  because of its soft clean scent. .. Nice compliment !</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance. Have used it for years. Hard to find in department stores any more. Always get many compliments and women ask the name of it and then write it down, so I know they really mean it.  THIS USED TO BE TRUE, BUT IN 2016 I BOUGHT THREE BOTTLES AND ALL HAVE ALMOST NO SMELL AT ALL!!! BEWARE!!</li>
    <li> Lovely, clean scent - perfect for just about any occasion and particularly nice now for summer when you don&#x27;t want anything too overpowering!  Has got to be one of the best values out there.</li>
    <li> I love this parfum.  I use it everyday since 6:30 in the morning and in the afternoon a lot of people keep complimenting the clean soft smell of it. I recommend it if you like soft, clean, jazmin kind of aroma.</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and was of good quality. My mom loves this perfume and this is the cheapest place to get it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on this perfume I have ordered it a few times and will continue to order it. It is a clean not overpowering smell so it is perfect for work</li>
    <li> I chanced on Casual Perfume about 6 years ago and have not used anything else since then.The scent goes well with my body, as evidenced by the many compliments I received. They keep asking what the perfume is. As they say, perfume should go with your body chemistry and I found the perfect one. It is my signature scent- love, love it.</li>
    <li> Love this scent and have used it for years - most men say, &amp;#34;oooh, you smell good!&amp;#34;,&lt;br /&gt;and my husband says it doesn&#x27;t bother his nose - many perfumes give him a headache!</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance and i was impressed by the delivery time</li>
    <li> Like several other reviewers, we received what appears to be a fake version of Casual perfume. My wife has used Casual for many years, but became nauseated from the smell of this one - definitely not the real thing.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Not too strong and it last all day. Even when you cant smell it, I have people asking me what Im wearing!&lt;br /&gt;I would def recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Quick, easy and I received my order in just a few days.&lt;br /&gt;My wife was very happy and THAT&#x27;S what it&#x27;s all about!</li>
    <li> Love it. It is a fresh powder scent and is admired by many people.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I get so many compliments on it. I have used it for years and couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> it smells like a fragrance i used to get from bath and body works but&lt;br /&gt;is no longer available which was Hearts Desire</li>
    <li> Great smell, very light. Works real well with the body wash for a clean fresh scent all day. Would and have recommended to everyone.</li>
    <li> this is the only perfume that smells good on me.  I always get LOTS of compliments on how good I smell</li>
    <li> I LOVE Casual. This is not Casual. It is clear and watery. It looks nothing like the picture. The scent doesn&#x27;t smell right. It&#x27;s like a cheap imitation. So disappointed. Hate the fact that amazon doesn&#x27;t let you return cheap &amp;#34;parfum&amp;#34; due to health reasons. It&#x27;s unhealthy to pollute the air with this junk.</li>
    <li> OK - I have worn this fragrance for may years (since the 90&#x27;s, I think). When it was initially discontinued in stores, I tried another more expensive brand that I also enjoyed for a number of years. But, when budgets became tight and I wanted a nice fragrance at a reasonable price, I was so excited to find this online. It&#x27;s amazing the number of compliments I receive and they always want to know the name of the fragrance I&#x27;m wearing. One of my friends received it as a gift and was surprised to know how much it cost. My husband likes the men&#x27;s fragrance as well. We&#x27;ll stay true to Casual as long as they make it! Super happy customer!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume and it is not sold in stores any longer.  I have gotten so many compliments over the years. I was so dissappointed. It&#x27;s all alcohol. And I can&#x27;t return it. Waste of my $20.</li>
    <li> love the scent...fresh and light. Great for every day and even those special days. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This smells terrible. If you are sensitive to perfume, it will give you an instant migraine. Even if you like stinky, floral, cheap old lady perfume, please do others around you a favor and do not buy this.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> nice bottle. great price. luv the scent. second time i made this purchase. crazy that there is a minimum requirement for amount of words you must say</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift for my mother in law.  She loves it and has used it for years!</li>
    <li> My most favorite scent.  I get complements on it all the time.  I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 10 years.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Floral, romantic scent that lasts but not over powering.</li>
    <li> Smells like straight rubbing alcohol mixed with sweaty butt. If I could give it no stars I would!!! Thumbs DOWN</li>
    <li> OMG  love this cologne</li>
    <li> My husband is very hard to please with the smell of perfumes. He is a Paul Sebastian customer has been for many years.He purchased this for me for Christmas and I have to say we both love it...Finally</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. It has been my signature fragrance for over 20 years. It has the cleanest smell and the men love it. If I go to the mall, at least five men will stop and ask what I&#x27;m wearing. So they can purchase for wife of friend!!!  You will love it.  I just received a new bottle from Amazon. I don&#x27;t know what everybody is complaining about! My perfume bottle smells exactly like what I bought in a department store over 20 years ago and paid $40 a bottle for. I don&#x27;t know maybe something is wrong with your nose are they got a call it or they got allergies my perfume smells exactly the same. Five stars plus here!!!</li>
    <li> not too strong. great for day.  ok for eve.  nice fresh clean powdery citrusy scent. if you like clinique happy, youll like this.</li>
    <li> smells good  and last all day! My neighbor  loves this fragrances and that all she wares....It smells very good on her</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance! Takes me back to some very fond memories.  Long lasting.  I always get compliments when I wear it.!  Timeless</li>
    <li> this perfume is great. the smell is so sexy and light, yet strong and seducing. i love perfume and this one is definitely my new secret...</li>
    <li> What can I say,  I like it smells good.</li>
    <li> The bottle has no nozzle and straw, different than the old one I bought years ago in high street shop. The scent can only stay for 1 hour or so. I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments on &amp;#34;how I smell&amp;#34; :-) Things like, &amp;#34;you smell soooo clean!&amp;#34; &amp;#34;is that soap or cologne, it smells wonderful!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My mom couldn&#x27;t find this anywhere, so I bought it here. The reviews said it smells different than the original Casual but it didn&#x27;t for me or my mom. She LOVED it. And it&#x27;s a great price for such a classic perfume. :)</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this for years and I still get compliments on how good I smell. I love Casual!</li>
    <li> Casual by Paul Sebastian is a wonderful cologne. Light an fragrant not a heavy harsh smell....have been wearing it for years an could not believe the low price on Amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> Glad I found it...!!:)</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent.  Everyone wants to know what scent I am wearing.  I wear it all the time.</li>
    <li> This is the original scent which always sends compliments my way. After a previous order that did not hold it&#x27;s fragrance, the company refunded my money and sent me a new bottle. They were very good with their customer service by following up with phone contact. I am happy with the result.</li>
    <li> I have bad body chemistry when it comes to perfume.  This is a clean pleasant smell!  Get tons of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I have worn Casual for many years and this product is not even remotely similar to Casual . You will be extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> Have been using this perfume for years.  Nice and light and just a beautiful as the first time I used it!  So glad I can get it through Amazon!</li>

    <li> I really like this scent.</li>
    <li> I really love this cologne and it is hard for me to find one that smell well  with my chemistry.  This one works really well for me.  Will always use this cologne.</li>
    <li> does not have any smell to it.  I think it is old</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE WAY THE DESIGN OF THE BOTTLE FOR THIS PERFUME. I ALSO LOVE THE SMELL OF IT. I RECOMMEND THAT YOU BUY IT IF YOU WANT TO SMELL GOOD.</li>
    <li> I did not like the scent ,</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance, but fairly pricy at Macy&#x27;s on my current budget.  So happy to find a large bottle of the real thing for &amp;lt;$20 at Amazon &amp; with free shipping too.  &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> You will love the flowery  fragrance of this perfume</li>
    <li> I love smelling it on someone who introduced it to me.  Hope it smells as delicious on me.</li>
    <li> great scent, got it for my mother in law, super happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Casual for many years. It is &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; fragrance; light and fresh.  I get so many compliments when I wear it. I have had complete strangers stop me and ask what perfume I am wearing. Sometimes in the summer I wear Causal with a light spray of White Shoulders, again I get compliments wherever I go. Casual and White Shoulders are my favorite scents.</li>
    <li> This was a gift, but my mom loves it. Light fragrance; not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I have been using Casual Paul Sebastian perfume for 8 years and I absolutely love it. Since I could not find it in stores anymore I decided to order it on line. However, I was so disappointed when it arrived and I discovered it was a fake. The smell is terrible, nothing like the real perfume. It smells like bad fruit. I had to throw it out. I am now desperately looking for the real thing. If anyone knows where I can get it, please let me know.</li>
    <li> I looked everywhere for the casual perfume and was so glad to found it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner. My favorite perfume</li>
    <li> My 96 year old grandmother uses this perfume. She ran out and we were visiting her. She said she was having a tough time finding this in the store and I just went online while we were talking and ordered it and sent it directly to her house. She got it in about 3 days and was tickled to get it. She is definitely not technology oriented but she has enough grandchildren and great grandchildren to help her on that part.</li>
