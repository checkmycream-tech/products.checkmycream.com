      <li>We now own the Seki nail and toenail clippers.</li>
      <li>This is a good clipper much better than the cheaper ones that I purchased in stores over the years.  </li>
      <li>Superb quality at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t see the difference between the Deluxe clippers and these (non-Deluxe) ones:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also own another clipper without the catcher to do the deeper clip.</li>
      <li>Nice functional clippers for thicker toenails.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Admittedly I don&#x27;t buy toenail clippers often but this one was extremely sharp.  It cuts through the thickest nails with ease, very little pressure necessary.  I don&#x27;t know if this is a superior product or if the previous one I&#x27;ve been using is just worn down.  Needless to say, it was a great surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally purchased this clipper for the &amp;#34;nail catcher&amp;#34; feature.  It works well enough if you clip off big pieces.  Smaller/finer clippings may still fall out so be a little weary.  The nail catcher also makes the clipping end of the clipper slightly thicker; for me this can make it difficult for me to clip the deep corners of my toes.  Maybe this is just a problem for me.  Maybe no one else clips their toes that cleanly/deeply.  In any case, the nail catcher can be removed in this instance, but then I&#x27;m just back to using a regular clipper.</li>
    <li> I set out to buy a &#x27;good&#x27; pair of finger nail clippers, and stumbled across all the glowing reviews of this brand. After trying the finger nail clippers, I knew the toe nail clippers were going to be just as good. I was not disappointed, these are amazing. The blades are formed from polished stainless steel, the handle from a brushed metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a little more expensive that I&#x27;m used to paying, but based on the reviews I thought I would give the Seki brand a try. I&#x27;ll never use a different brand again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of design work went in to making these feel comfortable and perform well. From the ever so slightly curved blades, to the ergonomic styled handle with groves and indentations to ensure a comfortable and stable grip. These feel well made, and work just perfectly. Sharp, well balanced, and ergonomically formed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They make a very satisfying noise when the metal blades close together. OK, so these are only nail clippers, and no need to get too excited, but it is difficult not to be excited about a product this good.</li>
    <li> These toe nail clippers are sharp in style and cutting. They are made so you cannot cut too deep. As far as the clippings being caught inside, I am not too sure about that or really care that much. Since I walk a lot for health, I don&#x27;t want my nails to be too long in my tennis shoes. I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> The first thing I did after using these Seki Edge Toenail Clippers for the first time, on my fingernails, was go through the house and gather up a box full cheap dollar store clippers collected over 25 years and throw them in the garbage.  Never again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Seki Edge Toenail Clippers are fantastic for fingernails.  They are effortless, smooth and sharp as a razor.  The stainless inset file on back and the contoured lever prevents the clippers from slipping when in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife tried them out on her dainty fingernails and refused to give them back.  I was hoping she&#x27;d do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I do the trimming on the cats claws, I ordered 2 more pair, one for me and one for the cats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I later discovered that our vet uses these same clippers on his kitty patients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most fingernail clippers are too small for my hands and are hard to control.  These Seki Edge Toenail Clippers are the perfect size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has small hands and she loves these Seki Edge Clippers for her fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, since toenails are like paper products in an office supply warehouse and come in every thickness imaginable, for my toenails, I prefer the Mehaz Professional Wide Jaw Slant Edge Toenail Clipper which has a jaw opening of 4mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison, the jaw opening on these Seki Edge Toenail Clippers is only 2mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let your toes get in a jam.</li>
    <li> Best toe nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used. Sharp as heck, and works wonders. I&#x27;m happy with it and use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I thought I try these toenail clippers based on reviews.  The clippers barely even clasp onto my nails.  When and if they do grab on my toenails, it does cut but it cuts just a small sliver of my nails.  The opening is too narrow and I do not even have thick toenails.&lt;br /&gt;These are worthless.  I wasted money again at Amazon.  I say that about half of my Amazon purchases, the products do not live up to standards described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could return these too.</li>
    <li> These are the best I have found. They are very sharp and easy to use. I already had a fingernail version that I bought over a year ago.</li>
    <li> Very sharp.  The 4 star rating is because it is very difficult to see what/where you are cutting the nail.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why these are so good, but they are.  The plastic casing around the lever means that it is easy to grip and a cinch to cut.  They are so easy to use, even on the thickest of nails.  It takes something that I dread (cutting my toenails) and makes it completely easy.  I have already purchased a second set for my mom.  Can&#x27;t recommend these enough.</li>
    <li> As a type 2 diabetic I need to do this job very carefully with a quality clipper . I&#x27;ve never had one this sharp and effective!</li>
    <li> If you got toe nails and they are stubborn to cut this is the clipper.  Like a knife through butter.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little awkward to hold at first with the sleeve on it, but gives an easy, clean cut every time! No clippings flying everywhere. The file is difficult to get at, and is kind of useless in my opinion, when you can buy a cheap pack of files from any store.</li>
    <li> They perform their job well, I can not say much else.  Pay for something nice the first time around perhaps?  I appreciate the nail file on the bottom end because sometimes I mess up the cut and filing the nail a bit is a great way to make sure you don&#x27;t snag things or people with a poorly cut nail.</li>
    <li> The plastic Control catcher makes the clipper feel wider than it really is.  Clipper itself is narrower than I imagined and narrower than a cheaper large nail clipper bought at a local store.  Hard to get around the big toe and thumb nails.  However, clipper is very sharp.  Reread the product description and sure enough, there is a file on the bottom of the Control catcher/clipper.</li>
    <li> Seki is the best nail cutter on the planet. I&#x27;ve always used this brand and only use this brand for cutting my nails.</li>
    <li> HOOKED ON THESE. GOOD STOCKING STUFFER ;+}</li>
    <li> It is sharp and easy to hold...just need to be a little limber to reach my toenails and make it easy to cut.</li>
    <li> Not wide enough opening for thickened nails. No better than one I have</li>
    <li> I have only used them a few times but these seem more sturdy, and have better cutting edges, than the inexpensive clippers available at the drug store.  Only time will tell if they last.</li>
    <li> Great nail clippers. Very, very sharp and make clipping nails effortless. I use these for fingernails and they are just the right size (I consider my hands/fingers to be of normal size for a 6&#x27;2&amp;#34; guy).</li>
    <li> holds all the clippings in there. Easy to clean. the fingernail version works great also. I&#x27;m definitely not buying anymore clippers that won&#x27;t catch nails ever again.</li>
    <li> Good cutter.very sharp</li>
    <li> My wife wanted a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; pair of clippers instead of the cheap ones I usually get.  She won&#x27;t use these either.  I find the plastic (probably added for old or arthritic hands) to be cumbersome and get in the way.  I take them out of the plastic to use them.  Unfortunately, the file is in the plastic which makes it almost unusable for me.</li>
    <li> Super sharp, convenient.  Works well for the whole family including kids</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always just bought the 2 dollar junk ones from the checkout stand but this is of high quality and comes with a lifetime warranty so ill never go back to those cheap ones again on cost alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price aside, they cut like a dream. The catcher works pretty darn well. It hardly ever misses a clipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using these was a revelatory experience! I always dreaded clipping my nails but this makes it so easy and quick. I use it on my hands and feet.</li>
    <li> I got tired of inexpensive clippers going dull, so I splurged on this one. It has lived up to all of the positive reviews I had read.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. Its absolutely a MUST HAVE in each and every home. The superb quality reflects in the product.</li>
    <li> I like this product for fingernails only since it has a small concave cut blade.  I purchased the Kai 001 L with a large straight blade for toenails.  Podiatrists recommend straight or convex to avoid ingrown toenails.  I decided to compare both brands.  Both are made in Japan and are very sharp.  Both have removable clip catchers.  Both can be used without the catcher to reduce overall size.  To show the relative sizes my photos also show a Trim (Bassett) convex Toenail clipper and a US quarter coin. Both products are excellant.</li>
    <li> Not worth it. The blades are sharp, presumably because it&#x27;s new but I have a dollar store clipper from a decade ago which is more functional. Clippings fly out, the plastic cover is very difficult to slide back, and it doesn&#x27;t even add that much value, considering its bulk. It&#x27;s nice that it doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy, but now I&#x27;m not so sure I need a solid clipper, so long as it does its job and has easy cleanup.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect clippers for my boyfriend who has toenails like Sasquatch.  Seriously gets the job done. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect nail clipper. Ideal. Not quite big enough to be a toe clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depends on your toe size i suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still five stars!</li>
    <li> Clean cutting and with much less effort than other clippers i&#x27;ve used.  Expensive, but worth the money.  I separate these from other clippers in my house so they don&#x27;t get lost.</li>
    <li> Best nail clipper I have ever used. Really works on thick nails with very little pressure. Good for arthritic hands.</li>
    <li> A little bulky to get used to but it catches the nail trimmings really well. This stops them from flying around and then you just dump them out. The sides of the blades curve slightly towards the nail.  It is also the sharpest clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR FINGER NAILS.  LOUSY FOR MENS TOENAILS.  DOES NOT OPEN ENOUGH TO ALLOW CUTTING LARGE TOE NAILS.  MIGHT WORK FOR JAPANESE MEN, NOT FOR SIZE 11+  MALE FOOT.</li>
    <li> At first glance it looks like any clipper, wrong, it is extra sharp and cuts even really thick toenails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never by cheap local store clippers again.  I have heavy nails and these make quick work of them.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think a nail clipper would make much difference, but it does.  This one has a thicker top lever and it&#x27;s easy to cut thick toe nails, i was pleasantly surprised that clippers do make a difference, it cut through easily and seemed like less effort.  The toe nail catcher plastic is ok, although i didn&#x27;t use it much, it does make it seem bulkier.  Some complained that they couldn&#x27;t use the file as it&#x27;s sort of indented in the plastic base, but i had no trouble with it.  It&#x27;s a little bit in because of the plastic toe nail catcher housing, but you can take it off, but i didn&#x27;t.  I still didn&#x27;t have trouble using it, it was sharp, i guess the only problem is that the file is a little small and you have to go back and forth a lot, but it works.  Glad i bought it.</li>
    <li> This is really great! I always  thought that those old $1 clippers were good enough, but this is worlds better!</li>
    <li> I finally spent a few extra dollars and bought Seki.  Should have done this way sooner!  I purchased a curved nail clipper and a straight-edge toenail clipper (have to be careful of ingrown toenail).  Wow!  I will never go back....  These are quality clippers ~ no fighting to get through the nail and no splitting.  They handle quite well.  I&#x27;m very happy with them, and my husband likes them, too.</li>
    <li> Bought these or my dh.  He loves them!  :-)  what else can you say about toe nail clippers?  Plenty sharp and more room for getting toe nail into it.</li>
    <li> These are the best and sharpest clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. They&#x27;re moderately priced and accomplish the job with very little effort. I recommend them.</li>
    <li> Effective at catching clippings, been using for about 6 months now and still just as sharp. I&#x27;ve gone through so many clippers and none match up to this one. I&#x27;ve just ordered 3 more to give out as gifts.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know a nail cutter could be so easy and smooth.  Worth every penny!  It fits ergonomically into the hand and the cutting action is very easy.</li>
    <li> purchased before 10 yr. ago</li>
    <li> Works really well....better than anything I have been able to find up to this point. You can grip very easily.....no fumbling around......worth every penny and it was a great price to boot.  Amazon, as usual, great delivery !!</li>
    <li> This is a good clipper much better than the cheaper ones that I purchased in stores over the years.  Works well and worth the few extra dollars</li>
    <li> Wow. I never thought I would rave about a set of toenail clippers. You can feel the quality with the first nail you do.  Great..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a toenail clipper. Not really anything special.</li>
    <li> Super Sharp and good grip. Makes it easy to trim nails.</li>
    <li> no more of those cheap drug-store bought clippers that are dull after 3 uses... this thing will cut down a tree! well made and sharp</li>
    <li> It is very easy to use and cuts easily and quickly.  I am diabetic and these are excellent for trimming toenails.</li>
    <li> After using these clippers for the first time I thought, &amp;#34;I had no idea they made these for professionals.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like very expensive professional hair cutting scissors, I assume they also make manicure tools for the professional and these must be in that class!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re very heavy compared to the consumer grade clippers you get at your local Wal-Mart, and the price is only a few dollars more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They cut VERY well, no hesitation, or prying, or twisting with the Seki Edge, they cut easily thru the toughest nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything this might be a problem, as they cut with such a &#x27;snap&#x27;, that you may end up with a few clippings flying out onto the floor, your desk (I use mine for my fingernails, too), etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s OK, though, because these cut so well, I don&#x27;t mind a little cleanup, and most of the clippings do end up inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these to replace the $4 clippers I bought at Wal-Mart. The Seki&#x27;s are about twice as much, but easily three times better than the cheaper brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my rotten children stole my cheap clippers. No one has confessed despite repeated interrogations, but if these disappear I should be easily able to identify them, assuming I can actually find them in someone&#x27;s possession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy these, they&#x27;ll be the last clippers you ever buy. Unless you have kids...</li>
    <li> I am a fanatic when it comes to keeping my nails cut short. Until I discovered these clippers I always used Revlon clippers and wasn&#x27;t entirely disappointed. However since I started using these Seki clippers I have noticed that my nails no longer have a sharp edge to them after being cut. The design of the handle is also much more comfortable than other clippers I have used over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easily worth the money.</li>
    <li> These clippers are a cut above.  (Pun intended.)  They work very well and are sturdy.  Also they are impressively well-designed.</li>
    <li> Good product, cuts clean &amp; sharp, excellent quality</li>
    <li> Fantastic clipper! My wife has limited strength in her hands and fingers. Pushing the head of the clipper out of the white holder gives her additional leverage and makes it even easier for her. The tool is sharp and cuts easily and beautifully. Great product!</li>
    <li> what a difference between this and drugstore clippers, I&#x27;m ordering 10 more for myself and family members as presents, or maybe I&#x27;ll just keep them for myself</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical but this thing catches 95% of my clippings and just works well.</li>
    <li> Cuts easily and nicely.  Comes with this large plastic case for ergonomic handling.  Never saw this on any other clipper.  Don&#x27;t think it comes off.  Didn&#x27;t want to force it off and break it.  Surprised that the metallic lever seems a bit like plastic rather than steel.</li>
    <li> This is the same review I left for the Seki Edge Deluxe fingernail clipper...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used these clippers and they cut through nails with no hesitation and using almost no pressure I was shocked.  I have always purchased what I thought to be &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; clippers like Revlon, etc which all required a lot of pressure to get them to cut and even then it usually wasn&#x27;t very clean so I just thought that all clippers basically sucked.  The Seki brand clippers are amazing and have held their sharp edges over several months of using them.  I&#x27;m sure they will eventually dull and wear out but I&#x27;ll only ever purchase more Seki clippers to replace them.  Try them and see the difference!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality trimmer.  Right size to use for either fingernails or toenails.  Not too big as some of them can be.  Sometimes easier to take off the white wraparound nail catcher when using on your toes.  It gets in the way otherwise and you can&#x27;t clip straight across.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this clipper for the high quality and precision of it. It feels very sturday and will probably be long lasting.</li>
    <li> The manner the toenail clipper cuts the nail is fast and with ease. There is no struggle whatsoever from my part. The clipper makes a click sound when it removes the nail. It is definitely good quality and worth the price.</li>
    <li> This product works fine. Seki seems a good company.&lt;br /&gt;How ever, I find that the ss 109 is a superior product from the same company.&lt;br /&gt;Even though it is slightly smaller, it cuts better and would probably work for most toe nails.</li>
    <li> These are great.  Worth the money as they cleanly clip your nails and capture the clippings so they don&#x27;t fly all over the place</li>
    <li> These toenail clippers ake okay.  They still didn&#x27;t go over the large bumpy nails. They may work for some people.  Any who, I have a good pair of regular clippers now.  I was letdown, but, that&#x27;s okay.  Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> This clipper makes my old toenail clipper seem like I was using a chisel to trim my toenails. This baby is SHARP. Sure hope it stays that way.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;From the creators of the Samurai sword in the mountains of Seki, Japan, SEKI EDGE combines centuries-old craftsmanship with modern technology to create the world&#x27;s finest stainless steel...&amp;#34; Toenail Clipper. The ancestors who once resided in Seki, Japan should be proud of this clipper with a hand-finished cutting edge. This clipper, capable of cutting down nail or foe, lives up to the back of the box product description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip: hold the bottom of the clipper downwards to better utilize the built-in clipping catcher.</li>
    <li> Very nice clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I did not like is the &amp;#34;file&amp;#34; surface on the bottom - could the gone without it.&lt;br /&gt;The catcher attachment was ok - because of the file surface on the bottom, I prefer to use it without it.</li>
    <li> A well-made, sharp nail clipper! Leaves a clean, smooth cut, not a jagged rough one like the $ .99 drug store versions. Also nice that it has the plastic pier to capture the cuttings so they don&#x27;t fly all over the room for you to find later.</li>
    <li> High quality product. feels very solid. cuts great, file is excellent, too. I own 2 other sizes and they&#x27;re all excellent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good quality but overpriced, in my opinion.  That said, it&#x27;s sharp and works as described.  So, if you don&#x27;t need this one, there are cheaper one&#x27;s too get, but you risk getting garbage.  I had a different clipper from a dollar store that broke when I just turned the handle.  So, at least you know this one will work well.</li>
    <li> These are by far the sharpest clippers I have ever used. The design and quality of manufacture are top-notch. I was so impressed I also got one of their fingernail clippers.</li>
    <li> Like a knife through butter on my thick &amp; tough toe nails. I almost bought the more expensive Seki toenail clippers, until I announced my intention to my husband. The look on his face made me reconsider. I don&#x27;t know if it would have been worth the extra $8 for the other version. But this version beats any toenail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used into the ground. It truly is life changing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t clear to me from the description, but the clippings catcher and file are part of a thing that the clippers fit into. The clippers can come out of it, if you don&#x27;t really want the catcher and file. The catcher only caught about 1/2 of the clippings, so not great but not terrible.</li>
    <li> I own some very nice pocket knives and it made me wonder if there was such a thing as a high end nail clipper. Somehow I made it to this Seki clipper. I own several folding knives made in Seki Japan, a place known for making the sharpest knives in the world out of the finest grade steels. I had to part with the money. I&#x27;m glad I did. This is worth the price compared to the cheap $2 nail clippers in the bin at your local drug store. Very sharp, good feel in the hand.  I almost don&#x27;t have to file when I&#x27;m done. Very nice product with a high quality look and feel.</li>
    <li> i have big, thick, gnarly toenails and these things cut through them like a hot knife through melted butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;worth every penny with the clean cuts they do on even the thickest of nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if youre looking around at all the fancier looking clippers, just stop. these look average but perform wayyyyy above average.  you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> Some clipper seem to just shred my nails, but these give a good, clean cut.  They are very easy to hold in arthritic hands too.</li>
    <li> I have problem toenails and I even have psychological problems cutting my nails. I get queasy and nervous when cutting these very challenging toenails. But these clippers are a god-send. They are, in a word, perfect. Everything about them is perfect. They make a difficult task all but effortless. I simply can&#x27;t recommend these clippers enough.</li>
    <li> These clip very cleanly with little effort.  They are so superior to every nail clipper I have bought over the decades.  I highly recommend them.  I will be looking at other Seki products as it seems they take pride in their products.  (Trying not to be an advertisement here, these are just that good!)</li>
    <li> Very nice clipper, I recommend you get the (mostly) stainless steel version instead.  The nail clipping catcher is useless, trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed several complaints about customers whose toenails won&#x27;t fit in this clipper.. I&#x27;m old enough to have thicker toenails, and I was able to clip them easily with the smaller FINGERNAIL version.  If your toenails are 1/4&amp;#34; thick, you really shouldn&#x27;t be looking here.  I recommend what a guy I knew used... AN ANGLE GRINDER. (Honest)</li>
    <li> Not sure what all the fuss is about with these toenail clippers.  Seems about the same as the last pair I replaced.  I&#x27;ve had this pair for about 1.5 years and it&#x27;s definitely not as sharp as when I purchased it.  I&#x27;ll likely try another model when I replace it in a few months.</li>
    <li> I have only ever used cheap drugstore nail clippers, which work just fine.  These Seki clippers were a real pleasure to use, however.  They are sharp and clip my thickest toe nails with ease.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a joy to use good tools. If you have ever used cheap quality clippers, you know the difference right away when you use these clippers. Sturdy and sharp. Why waste your money on junk? Buy these.</li>
    <li> will never use another brand..superb and easy</li>
    <li> clipppers work fantastically</li>
    <li> We now own the Seki nail and toenail clippers. After reading reviews for the fingernail clippers (after going through about 5 pairs of other brands) I took the plunge and bought them. 5 years after owning the fingernail clippers it dawned on me how awful our toenail clippers were so I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy these and I&#x27;m happy I did. Same great quality, nice sharp edges, smooth cut, easy to use. The toenail clippers come in a white &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; but it can easily be removed if you&#x27;d rather.</li>
    <li> Ordered from HeadtoToe.  This is a very good clipper and made in Japan.  Have used a few times and do not have any problem.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and easy to use. What more can I say?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m making up a kit of nail cutters, shapers and tools.  This brand is very good.</li>
    <li> File is exposed and rubs my finger when using the clipper.  That is like fingernails on a blackboard to me.  (How long before most of the population DOESN&#x27;T know what that means?)</li>
    <li> Best clippers I have ever had.  Well worth the price to have a nice pair.  Now I just have to keep the kids away from them so they do not become lost!</li>
    <li> This thing cuts like butter!!!  Wish I had known that there was a difference between drug store brands and quality clippers, it is like day and night!!!</li>
    <li> Works easily on my thick nails and the extra bulk of having it in the nail file case makes it easy to keep track of, but a little clumsy to use. The less expensive nail clippers I was buying from Walgreens really didn&#x27;t clip cleanly and took a lot of force. These cut right through without any effort and produce a clean cut. It&#x27;s just a little hard to position the clipper properly because of the bulk of the file case. It can be removed though.</li>
    <li> The clipper performed very well. The quality is very good.  Provides a nice clean cut. I would buy another one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve written reviews here for a couple of brands of nail clippers that did not work, one of them I think was almost as expensive as this one, with handles like wire cutters, but these cut through my very thick toenails like butter.  I&#x27;m happy at last.</li>
    <li> No more chipped and jagged toenails and struggling to fix a bad cut. Cuts clean and straight. I actually had to remove a whole large toe nail after a tree stump fell on my foot. Large toenail was bloodied and this clipper helped me painlessly cut away the whole nail. Expensive, but you do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Great clipper. I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing until I used this. The convenience factor of the nail catch is so good. I use this for my toenails and my finger nails.</li>
    <li> Is sharp and sturdy.  It is a bit awkward to use due its large case which catches the clippings, and I end up with the &amp;#34;corners&amp;#34; a bit ragged.  The problem may simply be the inevitable tradeoff for having the clippings caught.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, it&#x27;s sharp, we dig it.</li>
    <li> Seki clippers are fantastic. They give a clean crisp cut with no snagging or hanging of the nail. Yes, they are a little pricey, but you actually get what you pay for. Highly recommend Seki.</li>
    <li> I usually try to make the small, everyday things in life as enjoyable and efficient as possible.  I&#x27;ve neglected a better nail care solution for years, never really paying attention to it.  I have nail clippers - from CVS or something - they work fine.  Why try to fix it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My parents had been sharing a pair of nail clippers for years.  So for Christmas this year, I purchased these for my father.  He loved them.  So I tried them out, and wow, these are amazing. They make the process that much better - easier to handle clippers, cleaner cuts, and a nifty little cover that captures all your clippings.  Seeing as I clip my nails every 7-10 days or so, how could I not buy these for myself?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these toenail clippers, and the matching fingernail clippers.  They are very reasonably priced and I am very happy with them.  Order yourself a pair, and unless you are some kind of crazy nail clipper collector, I promise you&#x27;ll be more than pleased.</li>
    <li> These clippers work great their very sharp so you have to be careful they work much better then the cheap pair I used to have. I use these on my cats nails as well I would buy these again no complaints.</li>
    <li> Large size to get foot nails.  Doesn&#x27;t also collect as described so it gets 4 out of 5.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cuts clean. Doesn&#x27;t shoot the clippings all over the place, usually. I like it! I used it more for my finger nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish it had a hook to scrape the crud underneath but.. oh well. I&#x27;ll use a business card.</li>
    <li> My main reason for purchasing this item was the catcher compartment feature, which is supposed to contain the numerous nail clippings. However, this is only the case if you are holding the clipper at an angle that pulls the clippings downward into the compartment. If the nail clipper is tilted upward, which actually feels more natural, the nail clippings fall out, which totally defeats the purpose of having the compartment feature.</li>
    <li> I use this for cutting my cat&#x27;s nails--nice and sharp and easy to manage. I like it so much I&#x27;ll probably get one for us humans!</li>
    <li> This is the nicest nail trimmer I have ever used.  It&#x27;s big enough that I do not need to contort my body to reach my toes.  I have ordered a second one.  I might end up buying this for everyone&#x27;s stocking stuffer this year.</li>
    <li> Hubby&#x27;s toenails are really thick, have broken 2clippers on him. These seem to cut through easily and are so easy to use. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I have dexterity issues so I needed a pair of clippers that were sharp, easy to handle, and I like the little toenail catcher case. These exceeded my expectation! They are a bit pricey but hey they are awesome. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Works very well and keeps its sharpness.</li>
    <li> It is very sturdy and sharp. It is slightly more expensive than some other nail clippers, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC PRODUCT.  My husband loves them.  The first time he used them he said they were the easiest trimmers he had ever used.  I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Easy to use and sharp. No slippage in the hand</li>
    <li> Yes, a good quality product.  Arrived in great shape and on time.  Use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I think it is a great value buy.  The clipper is very sharp, but safe. It also easy to hold.  It is nice to hace a tool like this versus all the cheap clippers which slip out of your grasp and get dull quickly.</li>
    <li> Love these they are super sharp which makes it easier to trim nails and the nail catcher adapter is a good addition it can be removed if needed</li>
    <li> Love these clippers. Well made and sturdy. These really do leave no rough edges! Ordering  a second pair for my boys!</li>
    <li> I did not notice it was for toenails. It is huge.</li>
    <li> As advertised good clippers cuts thick toe clean and no sharp edges nails arrived well packaged will recommend product</li>
    <li> wow!  This is the sharpest clipper I have ever used.  I&#x27;ll be buying these as gifts!</li>
    <li> Toenail clippers should have a straight edge.  Curved can lead to ingrown toenails.  I don&#x27;t know what other are raving about with these.  They cut nails but they&#x27;re nothing extraordinary.</li>
    <li> bought it for my hubby. He loves how it catches all the nails. it&#x27;s brilliant for us lazy couple ;)</li>
    <li> Very sharp and the opening is wide enough to hold toe nails. The only complain is file. I had to practice several times to find the comfortable position to use the file without hurt my toes.</li>
    <li> Verdict still out on if it was worth the price....</li>
    <li> After buying cheap clippers for years this thing is fanastic for your nails. The other clippers would break down and get dull in no time but this thing is super sharp!!</li>
    <li> Best nail clipper for both fingernails and toenails.  Super sharp and the nail catcher is very handy.  I even bought another one to trim my cat&#x27;s nails because it cuts so cleanly and quickly.</li>
    <li> Too big for girl&#x27;s fingers</li>
    <li> I recently lost the toenail clippers I have been using the last few years.  I thought those were pretty good.  Not wanting the cheap, drug store generic clippers, I figured I&#x27;d cough up a couple dollars for some &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; ones on here.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting the price on these, but after reading the reviews, I figured I may as well give them a try.  As soon as they arrived, I used them.  The previous reviewers weren&#x27;t exaggerating.  These were comfortable to use, required very little pressure, and made nice, clean cuts of the nails.  In fact, the cutting was so smooth and required so little pressure, I actually butchered one of my toenails.  I was trying to get just a little deeper, got distracted, and cut my nail at a weird angle.  No damage done, and no pain, but next time I&#x27;ll make sure to remain more focused on the task at hand.  I am a lot more impressed with these clippers than I should be!  I would recommend picking a set up.</li>
    <li> I simply can not see how SEKI can make a quality product at such a low price! You can spend a lot more but you won&#x27;t get anything with better steel or function.</li>
    <li> fast delivery  &amp; good Deal, Thanks</li>
    <li> My husband loves it says it works well.  We grew tired of buying clippers that did not work well. Revlon leaves your nails with uneven cuts then you have to file them.  Tweezerman is better but still not as good as expected.  My 12 year old is using them right now. He says you need very little pressure to cut the nail and gives you a smooth cut.  The file on the underside is a little annoying but useful.  Do not expect the plastic compartment to catch the nail clippings because it does not.</li>
    <li> So times hard to make a cut without leaving a tiny sliver of nail that will snag on your sox. Almost too sharp for an amateur to use, probable a professional product.</li>
    <li> The title says it all. This is far better than any of the drug store clippers I&#x27;ve owned in the past. Very sharp, cuts clean, built-in file works well.</li>
    <li> Does what I want and be widely spread open .</li>
    <li> it is sharp, and has good leverage. but it leaves a nasty edge that needs to be filed, never have to do that with cheap 2 dollar clippers. and the catcher does not work at all.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this toenail clipper is as good as the review led me to believe it would be.  It is not easy to cut straight across the nail with it, it leaves nails very sharp, and it doesn&#x27;t always catch the nails when they are cut off.  It works okay, but is nothing special.</li>
    <li> Superb quality at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I use these to trim my cats&#x27; claws, and they&#x27;re perfect for that.  I have two older cats who aren&#x27;t particularly fond of having their claws trimmed -- sometimes, they&#x27;re just fine with it, but other times they&#x27;re not very cooperative.  It&#x27;s important to me to have clippers that are sharp and cut cleanly so as not to traumatize my furry friends more than necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried 3 or 4 other clippers (including a couple specifically designed for pets), and THIS one is the best so far.  It&#x27;s not too big and it&#x27;s easy to handle.  When you&#x27;re dealing with a cat who isn&#x27;t terribly interested in the process and is squirming a bit, having a secure grip on the clipper is essential,.  The \\&quot;housing\\&quot; holds the clippings until I&#x27;m ready to empty -- just hold it over the waste can, cutting end down, and shake a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a sturdy well-designed and well-built unit, and should last for years.  I know for sure that it&#x27;s much easier on my cats than other clippers I&#x27;ve tried.  Definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> Too narrow an opening for my nails</li>
    <li> this is a high quality clipper.  Especially like the idea that it &amp;#34;catches&amp;#34; the clippings, and it does.  Cuts clean and good quality.</li>
    <li> This clipper is the best one I&#x27;ve owned, so far. I am handicapped and it is difficult to care for my feet. The clipper is large enough to handle with little strength in my right hand. It is sharp enough to clip tough nails without making a raged mess of them. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> The best clipper. Very sharp. The nail catcher will get in the way on the edge with the deeper clip. I also own another clipper without the catcher to do the deeper clip. I hope they make the kitchen shears.</li>
    <li> This is the best clipper I have ever been using. I used to have to buy a new (cheap) one every few months and still  frustrated with their functionality.  This one last over a year already and still working nicely. It stays sharp and precise. That makes it much easier to trim nails for kids. I bought a couple and gave them to my Mom, brothers, and sisters. They all love it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It is worth the extra money compared to other clippers. The mechanism seems to be constructed more sturdily than others.</li>
    <li> Seems silly to review a nail clipper, but I bought this online based on the reviews, and frustration with blunt drugstore clippers. It actually is quite sharp, and the cover to catch nails is removable and easy to clean out. I actually had a visitor use it and ask me for the product info so he could buy it.</li>
    <li> very sharp and clips with ease. comes with the casing that catches clippings so you can use the clipper anywhere and dump the clippings after you are done.</li>
    <li> These babies really cut cleanly. Very solid feel to them. I have both nail and toenail sizes. I&#x27;m a guy with thick but short finger and toe nails. These cut my nasty thick toenails very cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The file seems odd. It is imbedded on the back of the clippers and seems less than accessible because it does not go to the edge. I admit that maybe I do not understand how to use a nail file when you can not get the edge on your nail. With this file, you can only really use it at 90* to the nail -- can&#x27;t get \\&quot;under\\&quot; the back of the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the file is less than perfect, the clippers are awesome.</li>
    <li> Nice item, need more time to evaluate the quality.</li>
    <li> The only thing I like about this clipper is the wide opening.  It does open enough to fit over large toenails, but only if you remove the bulky white case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are that it is dull and cuts the nails very raggedly.  The shape of the opening makes it hard to cut smaller toenails closely.</li>
    <li> Have only used it once but very impressed.  Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned. Almost doesn&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re cutting anything.</li>
    <li> What can someone say about toenail clippers? With this item I can say a lot. I have used these clippers for months so this is not a review of something rarely used. This is a high quality product from Japan. The blades are really sharp and cut thick nails easily and cleanly with no nail soaking. When I say easy I mean that very little pressure is needed on the handle to make your cut. No hard snap and no pain from a hard snap. The blades match each other so well that my wife can trim the claws of the tiny kittens that she is bottle feeding for a shelter. The plastic handle is removable if you wish. These trimmers may cost more but are well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> I only used it once so far and it seems to cut with less effort than others. I am satisfied&lt;br /&gt;with it. I dont know what the plastic part is for. I thought it was going to help me from&lt;br /&gt;cutting too close, but didnt and I cut my big toe. I dont blame it on the clipper though.&lt;br /&gt;I will just have to be more careful.</li>
    <li> A++++++. Super fast shipping and a great deal!  Thank you!!!!!!</li>
    <li> the end of clipper is not curved enough,it does not catch the cut nails.extremly sharp edges.very light in weight.happy with the buy.</li>
    <li> The best toenail clipper. I have a few thick toenail, and this clipper can cut it easily. Easy to hold.</li>
    <li> I hate toe nail clippers. They always split my nails and its always a hassle. I always feel the need to get them professionally done after I cut them. BUT I LOVE THESE! They cut flawlessly and without the slightest  but of effort. They&#x27;re awesome. Who knew you could be so happy over something so simple : )</li>
    <li> These clippers are so sharp it cuts through my fingernails like butter.  It&#x27;s so effortless and quick when I use them.  Be careful, though. it IS very sharp so you might accidentally clip to close.</li>
    <li> It is true you can probably cut through a steel nail with these, but functionally they are just horrible. They won&#x27;t even open wide enough to get your toe nail in there in the first place. They are heavy duty and high quality, they just were not designed well. I ended up just throwing mine away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars because they&#x27;re made well.  However, these clippers are not for a normal size American man. The arc is too small. Also, the design makes it hard to see the blade while using. I&#x27;m getting a clipper from the local Duane Reade.</li>
    <li> The best fingernail clippers I have ever used! I order a pair for all my family members!</li>
    <li> good quality but little be big ,</li>
    <li> I have gotten three of these now.  I keep them everywhere within easy reach.  They are much better than other brands of toenail clippers in my opinion.  I use them on both toes and fingers.  I removed the plastic holder and they are then very versatile.  They work well on my husbands very thick toenails and also do the job for the tiny hangnails I get on the sides of my fingernails.  Very sharp.</li>
    <li> For the price you cant beat them. They are so sharp and precise that I ordered their tweezers and fingernail clips and they are just as good.</li>
    <li> Wonderful clippers, for both fingernails and toenails.  Was getting unable to clip with left hand due to arthritis in thumb joint, but these clippers are constructed in such a way that it takes little pressure to use them.  Hooray!</li>
    <li> My giant fingers and toes require a lever and a fulcrum for which a simple toenail cutter does not suffice. Archimedes would own this toenail clipper, and use it often, when he was not busy discovering small cities in Alaska.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little nail clippings are no longer everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;This nail clipper rocks. And I have gone through (and broken) lots of nail cutters.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and cuts nails like butter. Catching container mostly works. Most clippers you buy in the store don&#x27;t cut toenails very well, this one is far superior.</li>
    <li> Strange to review nail clippers... Anyways, these work well, and the plastic guard which catches nails is super handy!</li>
    <li> This clipper is constructed of high quality! I cuts my nails really nicely.  I enjoy using this clipper and would recommend others to buy it!</li>
    <li> They are better than store brands even some name brands,they are made in Japan! not cheap china made. Cuts are clean &amp; sharp weather you cut dry/before or wet/after shower like me. Very little pressure is needed to clip nails(keep in mind I have average toe nails w/only thick nails on big toes). It Has a built in nail catcher that works great catches each &amp; every clipping make sure you tilt clippers back so clippings fall &amp; stay inside and empty after cutting 1-2 toe nails. I have yet to try file on nails since I have one already,clippers cost $12/&amp; change which is fine I feel the clippers should last 5-10 years.</li>
    <li> It works just fine but I removed the plastic part right away (it just slides off.)  I guess the plastic part is the &amp;#34;nail catcher&amp;#34; but it never caught a nail.  The &amp;#34;nail file&amp;#34; is just a rough surface on the bottom.</li>
    <li> My scary sharp Spyderco knife has Seki-City stamped on the blade.&lt;br /&gt;So, I decided to try Seki Edge clippers. Wow! Super Sharp!&lt;br /&gt;I have 3 old clippers that I will be tossing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small clippers are too small for most of my nails..&lt;br /&gt;The medium sized clippers are okay, but not very sharp. Kinda tears the nails off.&lt;br /&gt;The large (toe nail) clippers are a bit too large for my toe nails, and also very dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Seki Edge toenail clippers are a bit larger than then my old medium.&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;m a man with medium sized hands).&lt;br /&gt;They work great for pinky nails right on up to (thick) big-toe nails..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should get a another Seki for my bicycle med-kit.. I hate breaking a nail and having the ragged edge hanging off all day..</li>
    <li> I bought Seki&#x27;s stainless steel nail clippers, and after experiencing those, standard toenail clippers were no long satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these in a hurry so I didn&#x27;t see the difference between the Deluxe clippers and these (non-Deluxe) ones:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Seki-Edge-Stainless-Toenail-Clipper/dp/B0063LG46O/ref&#x3D;pd_sbs_bt_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;158C8KF4Y3H2ES4Q4K6F&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference is that the build of the Deluxe version is very similar to the run-of-the-mill nail clippers, although of course a bit higher quality. You want the (non-Deluxe) ones in the link because those are the stainless steel type that will give you that sweet cutting satisfaction.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for someone with thick toenails. He said they work really well. Definitely better than the cheapies.</li>
    <li> Pros: Well made&lt;br /&gt;  Sharp but not dangerous&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Slippery in hand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There might be some models out there more thought out (like Fukishima!)</li>
    <li> As is the case with the other Seki fingernail clipper that I&#x27;ve had experience with, the cutting surfaces on this one are just outstanding.  The difference between fingernails and toenails cut using this compared to a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; clipper is that the cuts are just so amazingly smooth.  It&#x27;s like my nails are getting cut and filed all at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I don&#x27;t think this form factor is my favorite.  The guard to catch the clippings is nice, and it does a well enough job if you hold everything at the right angle, but it prevents there from being a separate nail file that can swing out.  Instead, there is a file surface on the bottom, but it&#x27;s not really usable, and I miss having the little flat hook thing to clean the dirt out from under my nails.  Inevitably, I end up going to my old clipper just for the nail file bit to clean my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second issue with the clipping guard is that it juts pretty far forward towards the mouth of the clippers, such that it&#x27;s definitely more difficult to get the clippers where you want them if your nails have gotten kind of long, and it&#x27;s also harder to see where exactly everything is positioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to do it again, I would definitely get another Seki Edge clipper of some sort, but not this particular one.</li>
    <li> Despite other glowing reviews, I found this clipper to be a gimmick.  My regular high quality straight clipper does a better job.  This actually worked better for fingernails than toenails as it&#x27;s smaller than usual. I think it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is going to sound crazy, but this is seriously the best toe-nail clipper I have ever purchased. Originally, when buying it, I thought - &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a toe-nail clipper; like, how much better can it really be from any other clipper out there,&amp;#34; but, after reading some of the reviews, I decided to give it a try, and ... it is seriously the best nail clipper out there. Even the nail file on it is amazing, and ... it&#x27;s All metal, so the nail file never wears out! Anyway, I don&#x27;t know what else to say about a toenail clipper. lol. But seriously, this thing is worth the extra money - it&#x27;s just super sharp and clips so well. I know, that saying something like a lowly nail clipper is &amp;#34;Amazing,&amp;#34; but it really is true about this one.</li>
    <li> Well made, extremely sharp. Easy to use with no twisting or turning with tough nails. Versatile enough for fingers and toes. More than satisfied!</li>
    <li> Some thinks you should just no be cheap about. This is one of them.</li>
    <li> these are good,  but made for small people.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable handle and it cuts like a hot knife on butter with very little pressure or effort! That&#x27;s why I bought it, right? The only thing I found to be a slight negative is it cuts TOO well....so make sure where the placement is before you snip...you could easily trim more that your nail!</li>
    <li> These are, without any doubt, the sharpest clippers I have ever had!  I will purchase this brand exclusively in the future.</li>
    <li> easy to handle and much better than the cheaper clippers.  would definitely buy again.  would also give as a gift</li>
    <li> Just tried them today and worked great. Nice and sharp with positive action. Threw my other style clippers away. Even the file on the bottom works good, but not that concerned with it.</li>
    <li> After I bought this clipper, I threw out all the dull ones in our house. Definitely a worthwhile indulgence.</li>
    <li> The Seki Edge Deluxe Toenail Clippers are nice and sharp.  Great quality.  Since I am in my 70&#x27;s both my finger and toe nails are ridiculously thick and THESE WORK.  Enough said</li>
    <li> Nice functional clippers for thicker toenails.</li>
    <li> Got this as a gift for my husband.  He wanted a quality clipper and these do the job.  It&#x27;s very precise and easy.</li>
    <li> it is strong, not one of those that bends like the drugstore version. have used it many times. would order Seki products again.</li>
    <li> Your search for the highest quality clipper ends here. Believe the hype.. Buy it. You will not regret this purchase. The best clippers I have ever used in my 40+ years of life. These are a little wider than the fingernail clippers.</li>
    <li> Superior to any other clippers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and as long as my daughter and wife don&#x27;t find where I have it hidden I hope it will stay that way and not get lost.</li>
    <li> Seki makes great stuff</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-sharp and therefore cuts well&lt;br /&gt;-body of the clipper is enclosed in a shell that catches some clippings&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Sometimes will leave nails with edges that need to be filed (I&#x27;m lazy and usually don&#x27;t file my nails after clipping with other nail clippers, but with this one I find that I do occasionally have to)&lt;br /&gt;-not all the clippings are caught by the outer shell</li>
    <li> Does its job nicely!!!</li>
    <li> Product came quickly and as promised.  This clipper is a game-changer!  Very easy to use and is a well made product.  So glad I purchased!</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick and tough nails on my big toes, so much so that some cheap clippers have often just died on me. Those that manage to clip the nails usually do so in an uneven way; sometimes snapping the nail in an awkward way. Additionally, since the nails are quite thick and hard, the cloud part flies off in a random direction, ending up a couple of meters or more away. These are hands down the best clippers I have used for clipping my toe nails.These cut with a clean snapping action and have a housing that helps trap most of the clipped nails if not all.  I was divided between these and done other highly rated deluxe clippers here on Amazon, and while I can&#x27;t provide a comparison with other products, I&#x27;m certainly happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I only used it for few times so far, but they feel very solid and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;I just needed to get used to this, but it&#x27;s so far so good.</li>
    <li> The Seki Edge Deluxe Toenail Clippers are some of the best I&#x27;ve seen. I have an expensive pair from Brookstone and another pair that are German-made Solingen Steel, and neither compare in the least with the Seki Edge. The Seki are sharp, the gap closes completely with absolutely no light bleeding visible in the closed jaw. In a word, these do the job better than anything I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve tried several well-known brands that are more expensive but not nearly as sharp and precise as the Seki Edge clippers are. You will not be disappointed with these clippers. If there&#x27;s one thing I would ding them for, it&#x27;s just that the nail catcher doesn&#x27;t always work, but since it&#x27;s not really necessary in my mind, I don&#x27;t take any stars away from the rating.</li>
    <li> Quality construction Pleasant to use. Sharp blades, No uncomfortable nail pulling. Works fine for fingernails too. Cut nail  catcher is a plus. Good leverage for thick toenails.</li>
    <li> I had very tough toenails (I&#x27;m an old geezer) and my old toenail clipper wasn&#x27;t able to hack it but this Seki Edge made mincemeat out of my crusty talons.  Very good product!</li>
    <li> Believe the hype. I just wish it looked cooler. It looks cheesy, but I&#x27;m not about to knock off a full star for a toenail clipper&#x27;s aesthetics. Buy it.</li>
    <li> These clippers are so easy to use. In the past, I had trouble squeezing regular clippers when cutting my toenails. Not now! These are great!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  With my toenails, I have to consider having the local farrier stop by and re-shoe me.  After buying this clipper, I found that I no longer needed bolt cutters to trim my toenails.  Sharp with good leverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> How did I live without this!  I was so tired of cheap toenail clippers that bent the nail without cutting that I decided to try the Seki.  Love the product, and bought the fingernail clippers also.  I cut my husband&#x27;s toenails also, so I get a lot of use from this excellent product.</li>
    <li> Seems silly to rate a toenail clipper, but some don&#x27;t do the job.  This one does.  It&#x27;s slightly bigger than I like, but I&#x27;d never before realized how much better a really sharp, well-designed product is, compared to one I can buy for $2-3 in a drugstore.</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;m writing a review for nail clippers.  Clearly, I have too much free time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, this is coming from a man who clips his nails like a deranged child and has always used the $2 clippers from the checkout lane.  Oh man, are these things better.  I paid $10 for these and they are totally worth it.  First, they are so sharp that they clip my nail without leaving that rough edge that catches on everything.  In fact, they&#x27;re so sharp that they will casually remove any skin you accidentally get caught in them because you don&#x27;t pay attention.  Second, the little clip catcher is the reason I bought these and it&#x27;s great.  My wife always looks like she&#x27;s about to sign the divorce papers when I clip my nails on the couch and the shards go flying like spent casings being ejected from Rambo&#x27;s machine gun.  This thing catches about 95% of the clippings and the only ones it misses are the ones that fall into my lap and that&#x27;s not a big deal.  Finally, these clippers are very nicely made and easy to handle so even a clothed ape like me can clip his nails without dropping the clippers or fighting with the folding mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, you can either buy 5 sets of cheapo clippers that render your fingers into tender pink stubs or you can buy 1 clipper that will probably last you forever and won&#x27;t really require taking out a second mortgage.  Just buy these things, already.</li>
    <li> Works great--just need to find a good &amp;#34;container&amp;#34; to hold this and other products to keep in my purse with me.</li>
