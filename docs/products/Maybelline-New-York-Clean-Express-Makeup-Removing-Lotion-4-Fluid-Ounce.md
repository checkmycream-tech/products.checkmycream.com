      <li>Very pleased well order again.</li>
      <li>This works great-- I love that it is a lotion instead of a liquid.</li>
      <li>The price is good too although like I said before, wish it had more in the bottle.</li>
      <li>This is a nice liquid, that I use as pre-cleanser, to get Korean bb creams and sunscreens off.  </li>

      <li>There are better products out there.</li>
      <li>Leaves your face nice and smooth and make-up all gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>or maybe it is just more of a moisturizer than I like.</li>
      <li>I found the best application for this product was to take the cap off and squeeze the entire tube into the garbage.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it would take off the waterproof mascara</li>

      <li>Maybelline Flash Clean 3-in-1 makeup removing lotion.</li>
      <li>There was none the wipe was clean.</li>
      <li>NOT Maybelline Flash Clean</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite makeup remover.  </li>
      <li>For taking all the other makeup off it works great.</li>
      <li>Therefore, it isn&#x27;t that useful to me.  </li>
      <li>I use this product about 3 years, and it is very convenience for me because I do not need to clean my face once again when I was in hurry.</li>
      <li>My usual cleanser is great at getting all my foundation off but doesn&#x27;t get all the mascara, so I needed something for eye makeup.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product, and works just as well as more expensive products.  </li>
      <li>The bottle doesn&#x27;t contain much so I run out quick.</li>
      <li>but it did pretty well.</li>
      <li>but how will rubbing lotion into my face get the makeup to come OFF my face in the first place?  </li>
      <li>Stings in the eyes if you use too much but gets off makeup pretty well.  </li>
      <li>Wow it came super fast</li>
      <li>but it worked really well.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s so reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>so you get way too much.</li>
      <li>What I like about it is that it really takes off your eye makeup and doesn&#x27;t blur your eyes with greasiness.</li>
      <li>so I attempted to remove it from my skin, only to find that the whole lotion/makeup mess turned to some kind of oil! ....</li>
      <li>WOW!!  </li>
      <li>product really cleans-off all make-up leaving your face soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It leaves the face clean, without being too greasy or too dry!</li>
      <li>My eyes are super sensitive and long after using this at night to take off my makeup, my eyes continue to water until I wash my face.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried various cleansing products, many left my face feeling DRY and owl-eyed</li>
      <li>Next time I&#x27;ll stick with a normal makeup remover, which is sad because I find them a bit greasy (the flash clean is more of a lotion feeling).</li>
      <li>Plus it stings my eyes and sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This product helps take the chore of removing makeup off my sensitive skin a breeze .</li>
      <li>Three stars because it does what it says it would: takes off the makeup, leaves your skin soft and hydrated..</li>
      <li>My old eye make up remover</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After trying six or more skin cleansers this has been the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for removing makeup. This product helps take the chore of removing makeup off my sensitive skin a breeze . Not only does it take my makeup in a flash, but it also leaves my skin feeling softer . And it&#x27;s so reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite makeup remover.  Awesome on waterproof mascara.  I cannot find it in the local stores but Amazon came through!  Great!</li>
    <li> Some make up removers leave my face feeling greasy and oily, this one does the job without leaving anything behind.</li>
    <li> It removes some of my make up but it doesn&#x27;t work well at all. It doesn&#x27;t remove it all, it doesn&#x27;t remove my primer or eye make up at all. There are better products out there.</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser with a few exceptions. The bottle doesn&#x27;t contain much so I run out quick. Also, it&#x27;s a bit difficult to rinse off or maybe it is just more of a moisturizer than I like. What I like about it is that it really takes off your eye makeup and doesn&#x27;t blur your eyes with greasiness. There&#x27;s no sting to eyes either. The price is good too although like I said before, wish it had more in the bottle.</li>
    <li> best makeup remover ever</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it would take off the waterproof mascara but it did pretty well. Maybe if I left it a little longer it would have got it all. For taking all the other makeup off it works great. Afterwards I used a makeup wipe to see if there was any makeup left. There was none the wipe was clean. I will be getting it again.</li>
    <li> I love how it works quickly to remove my waterproof makeup. I won&#x27;t use anything else!!</li>
    <li> I use this product about 3 years, and it is very convenience for me because I do not need to clean my face once again when I was in hurry.</li>
    <li> Greasy and the opening is too big so you get way too much. A disappointment. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye makeup remover I have ever used.  It&#x27;s a,gentle remover without having to scrub and rub the eye area .</li>
    <li> WOW!!  This came so face, did you send it by Drone?  This is a nice liquid, that I use as pre-cleanser, to get Korean bb creams and sunscreens off.  The products are light weight, but the cling to the skin, this helps remove it!  I then follow with a liquid foaming cleanser!  It leaves the face clean, without being too greasy or too dry!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent makeup remover that does not dry out your skin. Makes your face feel moisturized after using it. I am buying it again and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> ...nope, it&#x27;s just a waste of money. I found the best application for this product was to take the cap off and squeeze the entire tube into the garbage.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just thick and creamy enough, dissolves makeup &amp;#34;in a flash&amp;#34;. It doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes, so it&#x27;s perfect for eye makeup.</li>
    <li> I thought this was just for the eyes so that&#x27;s the only place I&#x27;ve used it but it worked really well. My usual cleanser is great at getting all my foundation off but doesn&#x27;t get all the mascara, so I needed something for eye makeup. My old eye make up remover (it was in a lotion form too) made the skin around my eyes feel a bit raw, but when I use this is doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m putting anything on. I apply it with a cotton round and it gets all the left over mascara off. Best of all there is no residue or irritation around my eyes. I&#x27;ll probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> This works great-- I love that it is a lotion instead of a liquid.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even use waterproof mascara. Plus it stings my eyes and sensitive skin. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product and shipped super fast!!</li>
    <li> I wish this was hypoallergenic.  Three stars because it does what it says it would: takes off the makeup, leaves your skin soft and hydrated.. I don&#x27;t know it if CLEANS, I felt like I had to rinse my face though it says \\&quot;no need to.\\&quot;  Anyhow. It works fine, but my eyes are allergic to this.  My eyes are super sensitive and long after using this at night to take off my makeup, my eyes continue to water until I wash my face.  Therefore, it isn&#x27;t that useful to me.  Next time I&#x27;ll stick with a normal makeup remover, which is sad because I find them a bit greasy (the flash clean is more of a lotion feeling).</li>
    <li> The packaging leaves a lot to be desired and the lotion is very thick. It&#x27;s difficult to get the correct amount from the bottle, even when stored cap side down. I tend to use my hands to wash my face and it takes 2 hands to squeeze the bottle to get any lotion out of it. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product, and works just as well as more expensive products.  It&#x27;s definitely a great bargain.</li>
    <li> Very nice. I like it. It does the job.</li>
    <li> Wow it came super fast And it works great. Smells divine too. Very pleased well order again. the only thing as that they&#x27;re not really that big if I would have known the size was that small I would have ordered for which is why I will order again but otherwise I&#x27;m very very happy</li>
    <li> Terrible stuff.  The stuff comes out basically as a lotion - not the lather-it-up or exfoliating treatment I&#x27;d expect of a makeup remover.  In fact, the instructions say it&#x27;s not necessary to wash off - but how will rubbing lotion into my face get the makeup to come OFF my face in the first place?  All it does is smear my makeup and possibly drive it (and any dirt) deeper into my pores.  Gross!  Within minutes it felt slimy - so I attempted to remove it from my skin, only to find that the whole lotion/makeup mess turned to some kind of oil! .... talk about oil vs. water! ... Now the makeup wouldn&#x27;t come off, I had a greasy sheen all over my face, and water was only going to make matters worse.  I had to spend the next several minutes going through my cabinet to find something that could take the oil out of my pores.  Greasy slimy mess!  NOT RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for getting mascara off at night!</li>
    <li> greasy and definitely stings the eyes</li>
    <li> Stings in the eyes if you use too much but gets off makeup pretty well.  Probably wouldnt buy again...</li>
    <li> AMAZING TAKES OF YOUR MAKEUP BEAUTIFULLY AND WITH NO STRIGHLE WHAT SO EVER</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried various cleansing products, many left my face feeling DRY and owl-eyed (when you try to take your mascara off and product leaves you w/ big-dark-circles...NOT Maybelline Flash Clean 3-in-1. FANTASTIC lotion/eye makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product really cleans-off all make-up leaving your face soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the best way to use Flash Clean, is to squeeze-out-the-lotion to a dime-size and apply it to my dry skin (no need to use water to apply). Work in the lotion to your eyes, cheeks, neck for about 1 minute, then rinse. Leaves your face nice and smooth and make-up all gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yup, this is a keeper: Maybelline Flash Clean 3-in-1 makeup removing lotion.</li>
