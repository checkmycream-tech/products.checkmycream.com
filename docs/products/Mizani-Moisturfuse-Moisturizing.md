    <li> Love this will always keep it on hand.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner! Will most definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This works very well.  If you are going for a natural hair style and need the right amount of moisture for your hair, this is it.  Best bet, leave in over night and then rinse in the morning, or just let it sit the whole day.  You will notice the difference.&lt;br /&gt;Also, before you get your hair done at the shop, put this in the night before and the let the stylist shampoo it out.  Your perfectly moisturized hair will cut down the wash and drying time you spend in the chair.  Styling will be a breeze.</li>
    <li> My expectations were met.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a recommendation from a friend. I was not pleased at all. It doesn&#x27;t smell great and its a pain to get out of the tub it comes in. But worse it did nothing for my hair. It felt dry and like I never put conditioner in it after using this product. Not worth it at all.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.</li>
    <li> This conditioner makes your hair so soft &amp; so much more managable! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to my old shampoo/conditioner after using Mizani!</li>
    <li> No complaints, item as described.  Priced lower than what I can find it for locally.  The scent it heavenly!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE all products of Mizani.This product locks in moisture that is very much needed for women of color of all hair types.</li>
    <li> This product had such great reviews so I gave it a try...big mistake! My hair became so tangled and started to shedding and come out in clumps.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the feel of my hair after using it, a couple days after using i could not brush my hair.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CONDITIONER.  I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR MANY YEARS AND STILL CONTINUE WITH MY NATURAL HAIR.  I FIND THIS WORKS FOR MY VERY THICK KINKY HAIR THAT HAS NOT BEEN PROCESSED IN TWO YEARS.  AMAZON ALWAYS HAS A GREAT PRICE AND I USE A LOT OF PRODUCT WHEN I CO-WASH MY HAIR.  IT LEAVES MY HAIR SOFT AND MAKES IT EASIER TO COMB.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t yet tried the one I purchased but the reason I ordered this product is because my hair tend to be dry an my hairdresser used this conditioner on me an the results was amazing my hair felt so soft an nice. It came within 4 days which was good.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product great price for the amount you get, great bouncy shiny hair smell lovely too I definitely recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Bought it for a friend abroad and she seems to like it</li>
    <li> Mizani is one of my favorite hair care brands. It rarely disappoints. I used this conditioner when my hair was relaxed, now that its natural and everything in between. I love how defined my curls are after using this. Its great for natural, relaxed, color treated and damaged.</li>
    <li> iam natural very help full moisturizer</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner on the market. It leaves your hair soft and repairs any type of damage.</li>
    <li> I have relaxed hair that is thick and dry so I require products that infuse moisture back into my hair. I normally use Affirm or Nu Expressions conditioners because it makes the hair feel moisturized and very soft. This conditioner DOESN&#x27;T DO THIS!! It DOES NOT leave the hair super soft and detangled like other humective conditioners. This was a waste of money</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used in my life. It moisturizes adds strength with a tiny bit of protein and and smells like heaven to me. My hair is ssooooooo soft after using this everytime. It just gets no better this is a quality conditioner. You can use this conditioner once a week as a deep conditioner and your hair will always has what it needs!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going away to school and bought this to take with me in case I can&#x27;t find it where I will be. I will get several uses out of this tun, for sure. Not bad for the price. Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> After trying all types of conditioners for dry hair, Moisturfuse is the only hair conditioner that helps my hair.  I have dry coily hair that stays dry. I use this conditioner after I shampoo and the comb just glides through without snags and tangles.  I sometimes use this conditioner as a leave-in conditioner because it works just that good.  Although this conditioner is a little spendy, it is worth it for my hair type. Highly recommend this for dry coily hair types.</li>
    <li> Mizani Never Fails! I love this product it delivered exactly what it promises! Hair is left strong yet soft and manageable!</li>
    <li> I purchased the smaller size of this a while back and loved it so I recently decided to repurchase. First, I love the 30 oz tub it comes in, it makes it easy to scoop out. I use this as my daily conditioner and besides the amazing scent, over time the moisturfuse has made my hair stronger and softer(Ihave thick relaxed hair that is very dry). When this runs out I&#x27;ll definately be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I believe this is the best product for curly hair in the market in the last 2 years. Amazon has the beast deal.&lt;br /&gt;If you have curly hair, you would be so happy that you have found Mizani.</li>
    <li> This product smells soo good. My hair felt soo soft and clean. My hair feels soo much stronger and healthier.</li>
    <li> I will also continue to purchase this product. I love it. Great deep conditioner. I also purchased the Thermo conditioner and shampoo.</li>
