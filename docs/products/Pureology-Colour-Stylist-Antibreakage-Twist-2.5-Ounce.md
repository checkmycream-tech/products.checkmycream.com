      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>This is a great product once you figure out how much to use for your hair.  </li>
      <li>This had a creamier texture while the Texture Twist is more sticky.  </li>
      <li>and I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this product, but the pump mechanism on the two containers of it that I received did not work.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>My hairstylist tried this in my hair, and I love it.  </li>
      <li>Neither Control nor Anti Breakage Twist can give me the definition of style that Texture Twist is able to do.  </li>
      <li>It took me using this a few times before I figured out what amount was good, and what worked best.</li>
      <li>Love the smell, too.</li>
      <li>Love this hair styling product.  </li>
      <li>It was great for shine and maybe a soft hold but for taming flyaways and creating definition this didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
      <li>I have been using the original discontinued texture twist for almost 10 years now and that stuff was like magic for my hair.  </li>
      <li>I have fine, wavy hair</li>
      <li>HOW you use the product makes a HUGE difference in how it will work in your hair.  </li>
      <li>It leaves the hair smooth, shiny and manageable.  </li>
      <li>I could shampoo and condition, follow up with a leave in conditioner, and then put in original texture twist.  </li>
      <li>I first tried it when my hair was short, and it was all I needed to mold a great style.  </li>
      <li>I received this really quickly and it&#x27;s exactly what i wanted</li>
      <li>this was very light and did not have the same hold.</li>
      <li>Why would anyone who cares about bottom line discontinue such a winning product?  </li>
      <li>My hair dried with nice waves/curls and minimal frizz and nice bounce.  </li>
      <li>I had such an easy hair routine in the morning</li>
      <li>And on my hair, it&#x27;s very close to the nose, so the odor is ever-present.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t see a difference in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>However, I really cannot stand the chemical odor of this product.</li>
      <li>I could then go in with a little more original texture twist to smooth out when dried and to rework hair every morning.  </li>
      <li>It worked best when my hair was short (about down to my chin and layered) but it also works well now that my hair is down to my shoulders.  </li>
      <li>It can hold a decent curl, and also cooperates with a straightener.  </li>
      <li>I am a new mom right now looking to go back to work</li>
      <li>I will be looking for a new product and a new line of shampoo and conditioner...</li>
      <li>I have a very sensitive nose, so it might just be me.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair very soft and managable.</li>
      <li>It make my hair feel soft and helps keep the curl.</li>
      <li>I always apply it (less is more) when my hair is wet, or else it leaves it greasy feeling</li>
      <li>, thought my texture twist would be a product that would last forever, now I have to find something new and spend triple the amount of time on my hair, not to mention shell out $$$ in search of a comparable product.  </li>
      <li>I put this in damp hair and let it air dry, then gently separate the waves.</li>
      <li>Really makes a difference on dry hair!</li>
      <li>You really need to play with it to see if you need to put it in your hair wet, damp or dry.  </li>
      <li>If you have thick, semi coarse, super wavy almost curly hair, don&#x27;t even bother with this product.  </li>
      <li>keep trying to work the uber frizz out after my hair has dried (already used it in my hair wet) with a little more here and there and nothing.  </li>

    <li> This probably a very nice product. My hair stylist recommended it and she is very talented. However, I really cannot stand the chemical odor of this product. And on my hair, it&#x27;s very close to the nose, so the odor is ever-present. I have a very sensitive nose, so it might just be me.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t see a difference in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;A little expensive and didn&#x27;t really see the results I was expecting.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist recomended this... and boy am i glad she did !! Leaves my hair very soft and managable.</li>
    <li> This is what my hairdresser uses on my hair and I love this product.  I use it after showering or just on dry hair.  Really makes a difference on dry hair!</li>
    <li> This is a great product once you figure out how much to use for your hair.  It leaves the hair smooth, shiny and manageable.  Love the smell, too.</li>
    <li> I used to get constant compliments on my hair when I used TextureTwist. Antibreakage Twist leaves my hair flat and slightly greasy.  I will be looking for a new product and a new line of shampoo and conditioner... Goodbye, Pureology!</li>
    <li> I like this product, I like this product</li>
    <li> Love this hair styling product.  Can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but the pump mechanism on the two containers of it that I received did not work.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Not too stiff or too limp. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It make my hair feel soft and helps keep the curl. It seems like it doesn&#x27;t get as dry when I just it.</li>
    <li> So disappointed that Texture Twist if no longer being made.  Have tried Control Twist which is the \\&quot;replacement\\&quot; and it doesn&#x27;t do the job.  Was told to try Anti Breakage Twist.  Doesn&#x27;t come close to doing the job Texture Twist does.  Neither Control nor Anti Breakage Twist can give me the definition of style that Texture Twist is able to do.  BRING BACK TEXTURE TWIST.  Don&#x27;t know what their marketing department is thinking!  TEXTURE TWIST IS THE BEST PRODUCT EVER.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after being a faithful user of their Texture Twist.  I found that this product didn&#x27;t work as well as Texture Twist.  This had a creamier texture while the Texture Twist is more sticky.  I didn&#x27;t get any definition or seperation with the Anti Breakage Twist.  It was great for shine and maybe a soft hold but for taming flyaways and creating definition this didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this!  I have fine, wavy hair and this does the trick.  I put this in damp hair and let it air dry, then gently separate the waves. I get soft hold and texture with a little shine and zero frizz.  A LITTLE BIT of this product goes a long way.  You really need to play with it to see if you need to put it in your hair wet, damp or dry.  This is different than texture twist, but it does do what it is supposed to.  For the girls who have given negative reviews, go to your stylist with the product and have them show you how to use it.  HOW you use the product makes a HUGE difference in how it will work in your hair.  It took me using this a few times before I figured out what amount was good, and what worked best.</li>
    <li> I had tried a sample, and then i took the plunge. I received this really quickly and it&#x27;s exactly what i wanted</li>
    <li> I use when I am staying home and want a softer look and feel!</li>
    <li> My Wife Loves this product.</li>
    <li> This product works great in my hair.  I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t mouse, as mouse makes my hair too crunchy.  Gel doesn&#x27;t work well in my hair.  My hairstylist tried this in my hair, and I love it.  I first tried it when my hair was short, and it was all I needed to mold a great style.  I always apply it (less is more) when my hair is wet, or else it leaves it greasy feeling (some people don&#x27;t mind this for the sake of a good style, but I want touchable hair).  It worked best when my hair was short (about down to my chin and layered) but it also works well now that my hair is down to my shoulders.  It doesn&#x27;t hold in a curl so much, but it does keep my hair from going to crazy town.  I have hair that might be considered wavy.  It can hold a decent curl, and also cooperates with a straightener.  My hair itself isn&#x27;t particularly thick, but I have a lot of it.  This product works great for me.  I&#x27;d recommend trying it, as it might work great for you, too.</li>
    <li> If you have thick, semi coarse, super wavy almost curly hair, don&#x27;t even bother with this product.  I have been using the original discontinued texture twist for almost 10 years now and that stuff was like magic for my hair.  I could shampoo and condition, follow up with a leave in conditioner, and then put in original texture twist.  My hair dried with nice waves/curls and minimal frizz and nice bounce.  I could then go in with a little more original texture twist to smooth out when dried and to rework hair every morning.  It was awesome and my hair looked amazing, always got compliments, and just such an easy routine for me.&lt;br /&gt;Now, with the discontinuation of texture twist I decided to try this &amp;#34;the replacement&amp;#34; product.  Definitely not tacky/sticky enough.&lt;br /&gt;I keep trying to work the uber frizz out after my hair has dried (already used it in my hair wet) with a little more here and there and nothing.  I am a new mom right now looking to go back to work and this couldn&#x27;t have happened at the worst time.  I had such an easy hair routine in the morning, thought my texture twist would be a product that would last forever, now I have to find something new and spend triple the amount of time on my hair, not to mention shell out $$$ in search of a comparable product.  Boo!!!  So disappointed in Pureology!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have curly, wavy hair, which I can&#x27;t wash everyday, or it dries out. This stuff smooths, softens and realignes my curls to a perfect, you think I just showered look. I work it into my dry hair with my fingers. Sometimes a little blast from the hair dryer for lockdown.</li>
    <li> Expected this to be like the discontinued nanowax.....this was very light and did not have the same hold.</li>
    <li> Why would anyone who cares about bottom line discontinue such a winning product?  Bring back Texture Twist! There was nothing like it.</li>
    <li> Wife&#x27;s go to!  She has been using this for years.</li>
