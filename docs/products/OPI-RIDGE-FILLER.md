      <li>This is one of the better ridge fillers that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>I redid my nails tonight using 2 coats of ridge filler with the under &amp; top coats.</li>
      <li>It worked ok</li>
      <li>But I love this stuff and have already told my mom she needs to get it.</li>
      <li>Have used this for years-nothing better to smoothe out nails.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>you us on top.</li>
      <li>I love this product and can never find it in the store</li>
      <li>This was a pretty good product while it lasted.</li>
      <li>but I think it made them chip more easily.</li>
      <li>Like an old friend, it seems happily unchanged and as likable as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I find this covers all ridges very smoothly so that your nail polish goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>As expected from the OPI line, this is an excellent product.</li>
      <li>Much better than buffing to get nails smooth.  </li>
      <li>I like a clean, understated, feminine and sophisticated look.</li>
      <li>Love this as it fills in ridges,dries quickly and protects my nails.</li>
      <li>and I wanted my nail to look smooth when I painted them.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>Gives a nice matte surface so the polish really clings to it.</li>
      <li>It work well for my nails and makes them look smooth.</li>
      <li>It definately made my painted nails look smooth</li>
      <li>If you can do two coats your nails will be smooth as they can be.</li>
      <li>I needed it very much and my nails look much better.</li>
      <li>I love the product , it does exactly what it says.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and dries quickly.</li>
      <li>Hard to describe but very attractive.  </li>
      <li>Other than that it is a great product.</li>
      <li>Seems adequate, not miraculous</li>
      <li>A light touch is best, as the filler does dry with a white, matte finish.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good enough product that it is worth buying another one if you have the money to spend.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and dries reasonably fast.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!!</li>
      <li>Really helps to smooth nails.</li>
      <li>so can&#x27;t just put clear top coat over the filler.</li>
      <li>My favorite was an old Chanel polish.</li>
      <li>I often use it alone with a clear coat on top.</li>
      <li>It gave me time to really see that this ridge filler produces an amazingly pretty neutral, semi-matte, semi-translucent treatment!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d love to find a product that actually works.</li>
      <li>I found that this product has done exactly what I was after.</li>
      <li>This product evens the surface of my nail perfectly, and, for me, less filing and buffing means an ever so slightly thicker nail.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Gives a professional look in a couple of quick steps at home.  </li>
      <li>Awesome for a base coat and makes the main paint color look so much better.</li>
      <li>it does fill in ridges ( not 100%) but it makes your nailpolish last perfectly for at least 5 days!</li>
      <li>I have used various light colored, very translucent polishes.</li>
      <li>Really does the job of filling in those ridges that come with age.</li>
      <li>It really does work and makes your polish come in much smoother and cover any ridges.</li>
      <li>It does a very satisfactory job as an undercoat .  </li>
      <li>After applying, my nails look smooth and gives it a white color that alleviates the need to wear nail polish.</li>
      <li>You must always use two coats to do the job properly but when done your nails are so smooth.</li>
      <li>( It was very well packaged and on time.)</li>
      <li>It really does fill in ridges, it dries fast, &amp; does not interfere with the nail polish color</li>
      <li>I look at my nails and have never seen them look so good outside of buffing them down.  </li>
      <li>This is EXACTLY what I looking for as a signature neutral~~ subtle &amp; sexy!</li>
      <li>but after it dries you can rub your nails with a soft cloth and you have a soft, see-thru glowy look that mimics the appearance of healthy naked nails</li>
      <li>I needed something to fill in my deep nail ridges and this does exactly that and is not messy nor time consuming, dries quickly</li>
      <li>It is difficult to find in my area so purchasing online is great.</li>
      <li>Really makes the nail polish come on smoothly, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that around my cuticles, if I miss a spot of nail polish over it, it looks white and therefore making my nails look ashy.</li>
      <li>It does dry somewhat white so be sure to go over it with your color.</li>
      <li>So if you have gross indents from having acrylics removed this is the best fix without cutting your nails.</li>
      <li>Had to put it on immediately and WOW!  </li>
      <li>Good, smooth base for nail polish</li>
      <li>I like the ridge filler because it gives my home manicure a professional look.  </li>
      <li>Never having forgotten it, I was pleasantly surprised to see it by accident  on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>looked high and low for this product.</li>
      <li>It produces a very finished long!!</li>
      <li>Ridge Filler is a matte finish base coat that creates a more uniformly smooth surface on your nails.  </li>

    <li> I love this! It work well for my nails and makes them look smooth. It is difficult to find in my area so purchasing online is great. The price is much better too.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.  It looks horrible.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s review: This works perfect. It really does fill in ridges, it dries fast, &amp; does not interfere with the nail polish color you us on top.</li>
    <li> I wish I had known about this product years ago.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner. Pleased with product.</li>
    <li> It is leaving yeallowish color when used on the nails. Can not be used alone.</li>
    <li> Really helps to smooth nails.</li>
    <li> I bought this after getting my acrylics removed and as you know you&#x27;re left with awful ridges in your nails. I hate the way the indent looks so I thought this product would fill in the indent. It did! Not only that but the finishes is a matte white and so I found myself having to apply only one coat of color afterwards. So if you have gross indents from having acrylics removed this is the best fix without cutting your nails. They look perfect afterwards!  I bought mine at the grocery store and it was on sale for $4!!! Woohoo!</li>
    <li> This ridge filler is the best that I have found.  I was using another brand and I find this covers all ridges very smoothly so that your nail polish goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Really makes the nail polish come on smoothly, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that around my cuticles, if I miss a spot of nail polish over it, it looks white and therefore making my nails look ashy.</li>
    <li> I love this ridge filler! It saves your nails from being sand papered at the nail salon.&lt;br /&gt;I looked high and low for this product. Every place I went was either out of the product or didn&#x27;t sell it.&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy when I found it here.</li>
    <li> Great product. Second order.</li>
    <li> Love this as it fills in ridges,dries quickly and protects my nails.I am a ranch owner and around horses,dogs and cats...this lasts for over a week with no chips.</li>
    <li> not impressed. didn&#x27;t it long enough, possibly</li>
    <li> This was a pretty good product while it lasted. When I got half way through the bottle it started to get clumpy and became unusable. It&#x27;s a good enough product that it is worth buying another one if you have the money to spend.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say I am impressed.  I don&#x27;t think it filled the ridges, it just kind of dulled everything.</li>
    <li> Love this product; it does what it says.  I needed it very much and my nails look much better.</li>
    <li> Perhaps my ridges are worse than the other reviewers. But this product does not fill the ridges in my nails. It perhaps makes a small difference but not an awful lot. I have to put other polish over it to get the appearance I want. It is easy to apply and dries reasonably fast. O.P.I. also claims their U.S. product line is now non toxic. But since I bought it to fill ridges and it really doesn&#x27;t do that, I consider it a waste of money. I&#x27;d love to find a product that actually works.</li>
    <li> Where is O P I?  The product received is not O P I&#x27; it&#x27;s Orly.  I was quite disappointed but did not return it.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would work on my toe nails vertical ridges that I was told is an aging thing. It worked ok but I can still see the ridges through this base coat and two coats of polish and one coat of top coat. Not as bad as before but still visible.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I apply over a base coat and the ridges from my nails aren&#x27;t visible. If you can do two coats your nails will be smooth as they can be. It does dry somewhat white so be sure to go over it with your color. But I love this stuff and have already told my mom she needs to get it. I had artificial nails for my wedding and they wrecked my real nails. This stuff is awesome.</li>
    <li> Much better than buffing to get nails smooth.  I often use it alone with a clear coat on top. Really does the job of filling in those ridges that come with age. A light touch is best, as the filler does dry with a white, matte finish.  Have gone through 3-4 bottles over the last few years.  Have recommended to friends when they complimented me on my nails.  I do them myself.  Gives a professional look in a couple of quick steps at home.  Easy and effective way to strengthen nails and make them look their best.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Nice base coat for both finger and toenails.  Smooths out nails for any choice of polish over it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the better ridge fillers that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> I love the product , it does exactly what it says. And I was also happy with the fast delivery. Would buy product again.</li>
    <li> My hands are often in the line of vision of clients, patients, customers, ETC. I like a clean, understated, feminine and sophisticated look. I have used various light colored, very translucent polishes. My nails are medium long. My favorite was an old Chanel polish. It is a particular look that is very hard to define. Recently, I ordered a very pretty, very pale pink OPI polish. It was due to arrive the next day so, the night before, I applied a base coat, this OPI Ridge Filler &amp; a quick-dry top coat that had a semi/ to no sheen. Fine.&lt;br /&gt;The polish didn&#x27;t arrive for 3 additional days. It gave me time to really see that this ridge filler produces an amazingly pretty neutral, semi-matte, semi-translucent treatment!! I redid my nails tonight using 2 coats of ridge filler with the under &amp; top coats. It produces a very finished long!! I love this!! This is EXACTLY what I looking for as a signature neutral~~ subtle &amp; sexy!</li>
    <li> Have used this for years-nothing better to smoothe out nails.</li>
    <li> I like the ridge filler because it gives my home manicure a professional look.  It&#x27;s great for a base coat.</li>
    <li> This works great! It´s also a great base for pastels.</li>
    <li> As expected from the OPI line, this is an excellent product. I have some fairly severe ridges that I hate, and I had been filing and buffing my nails to reduce them. That worked of course, but it also made my already pitifully thin nails even thinner. This product evens the surface of my nail perfectly, and, for me, less filing and buffing means an ever so slightly thicker nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great OPI product!</li>
    <li> It really does work and makes your polish come in much smoother and cover any ridges. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I use OPI Ridge Filler by the gallons.  You must always use two coats to do the job properly but when done your nails are so smooth.</li>
    <li> it does fill in ridges ( not 100%) but it makes your nailpolish last perfectly for at least 5 days! ill keep buying for that reason only!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping!! Love the product!</li>
    <li> I received my filler this morning.  Had to put it on immediately and WOW!  I look at my nails and have never seen them look so good outside of buffing them down.  My nails are to thin for that.  I haven&#x27;t tried a colour yet, but can&#x27;t wait to see how great it looks.</li>
    <li> Love this ridge filler.</li>
    <li> Not as good as others I have tried.....does not cover ridges after two coats!</li>
    <li> I bought this ridge filler because I was having my fake nails taken off and I wanted my nail to look smooth when I painted them. It definately made my painted nails look smooth but I think it made them chip more easily.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thick and doesn&#x27;t do much to fill ridges.</li>
    <li> I love this product and can never find it in the store so I was thrilled to find it on line. It makes my nails stronger and I use it as a basecoat.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I&#x27;m coming down off gel nails and had some pretty serious grooves but after gentle filing and buffing this product smoothes my nails beds out like silk. You will need a couple coats. And it makes your Polish color pop.</li>
    <li> Good, smooth base for nail polish</li>
    <li> Works well but leaves a cloudy look to your nails so can&#x27;t just put clear top coat over the filler. Other than that it is a great product.</li>
    <li> You MUST take your time and apply evenly. If you do and apply 2-3 coats, it is a great base for polish, and I found the paint stayed on longer and was way easier to apply.</li>
    <li> Seems adequate, not miraculous</li>
    <li> I just love this product. Awesome for a base coat and makes the main paint color look so much better.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. It made polish last longer.</li>
    <li> I found that this product has done exactly what I was after. After applying, my nails look smooth and gives it a white color that alleviates the need to wear nail polish. I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
    <li> It is a good ridge filler. It goes on smoothly and dries quickly. I just wish it was clear so it could be worn alone, but I would hardly ever do that, so I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
    <li> I needed something to fill in my deep nail ridges and this does exactly that and is not messy nor time consuming, dries quickly so I can continue with next color.  some nails only need one coat while deeper ridges need two or three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not hesitate to re order, liking the product and delivery. ( It was very well packaged and on time.)</li>
    <li> Best ridge filler ever! Gives a nice matte surface so the polish really clings to it. Really does fill the ridges and makes the polish look smooth and perfect.</li>
    <li> I used this product some time ago and then I could no longer find it.  Never having forgotten it, I was pleasantly surprised to see it by accident  on Amazon.  I didn&#x27;t remember the  brand name but recognized it from the bottle pictured.  Like an old friend, it seems happily unchanged and as likable as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opi Ridge Filler is a matte finish base coat that creates a more uniformly smooth surface on your nails.  It does a very satisfactory job as an undercoat .  BUT, what I like is that it can be worn by itself and creates the look of buffed nails.  It goes on flat but after it dries you can rub your nails with a soft cloth and you have a soft, see-thru glowy look that mimics the appearance of healthy naked nails but with a subtle faintly opalescent glow.  Hard to describe but very attractive.  Love it!!</li>
