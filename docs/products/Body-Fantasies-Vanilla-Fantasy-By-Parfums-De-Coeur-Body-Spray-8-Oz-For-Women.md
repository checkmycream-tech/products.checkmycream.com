      <li>The fragrance smells like real vanilla extract and not fake, manufactured vanilla.</li>
      <li>I live in Arizona and found in the hot summer weather that Vanilla Fantasy was a great subtle scent and not over powering.  </li>
      <li>My sister really wanted a large bottle of this Vanilla Body Spray for her birthday</li>
      <li>My whole family uses it.</li>
      <li>This is the only fragrance I can wear comfortably.    </li>
      <li>The package arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
      <li>I will now try to locate something similar to their original aroma.  </li>
      <li>Please go back to the original recipe.</li>
      <li>I have made brought this product in the past an love love it, can&#x27;t find it in the local Walmart where I live.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I am highly allergic to perfumes.</li>
      <li>I have somehow become sensitive to most other fragrances.  </li>
      <li>The original formula in the bottle which is shown was amazing; the new formula in the newly designed bottle is watered down with much less vanilla than before.  </li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s true that it does linger for a long time.</li>
      <li>and i never saw it again till i was browsing online for a new set of sprays and saw this again.</li>
      <li>I completely recommend this to anyone who loves vanilla!</li>
      <li>Be aware that this vanilla spray is not the same as the bottle that is shown in the listing.</li>

      <li>, I came to find vanilla scent to be the only one I really want to wear regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really become a signature scent for me, and for only $7 or $8 a bottle!</li>
      <li>I will Continue to order this product from Amazon in the future, shipping of the product is fast.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m nearly 30 and have been using this spray since my early 20s.</li>
      <li>Well... what would you say if you suddenly smelled fresh baked sugar cookies and realized it was the person next to you?&lt;br</li>
      <li>I ordered the old version of vanilla body fantasies that they no longer make which is sold on amazon, and they mailed me the new bottle which is different ingredients than the old.</li>
      <li>This is subtle and lovely without being too sweet or juvenile.</li>
      <li>bottle retains a true scent to the end while the only small bottle I tried did not.</li>
      <li>I first encountered this spray in my mom&#x27;s cabinet as a little girl.</li>
      <li>Makes me sad, as in the past wearing it I received many compliments on its fresh smell.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I would have left a zero. Be aware that this vanilla spray is not the same as the bottle that is shown in the listing. I wrote to the seller two times and never got a response. Nothing. I ordered the old version of vanilla body fantasies that they no longer make which is sold on amazon, and they mailed me the new bottle which is different ingredients than the old. Does not smell the same at all. Be aware before you purchase!! Not a good seller at all. I&#x27;m out money and spray. So frustrating!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to say much, other than the fact that something in this product made me allergic, and I broke out in hives and itched like crazy for 2 days. But on the plus side, it did smell kind of nice.</li>
    <li> I have made brought this product in the past an love love it, can&#x27;t find it in the local Walmart where I live. I will Continue to order this product from Amazon in the future, shipping of the product is fast.</li>
    <li> I have used this body spray for years but unfortunately none of the local stores are carrying it any more. The package arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
    <li> I am highly allergic to perfumes. This body spray is light yet it lasts all day. I get compliments all the time whenever I am wearing it.  I NEVER need to buy the expensive over powering perfumes again!</li>
    <li> I have somehow become sensitive to most other fragrances.  Scents I used to wear now make me congested and even headachy.  This is the only fragrance I can wear comfortably.    Fortunately, I am also a kindergarten teacher, and it&#x27;s a definite job benefit to always smell like warm cookies!  I get lots of compliments on this vanilla scent.  Several times I have been just standing in a line and the person behind me (a stranger) says, \\&quot;You smell great!\\&quot;    The fragrance smells on you just like it smells in the bottle and lasts well throughout the day without changing. I agree with other reviewers that the 8 oz. bottle retains a true scent to the end while the only small bottle I tried did not.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite body spray and it is hard to find. so i went to amazon and they had it thank you amazon you are great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on 8/13/2011 and it was here by that Tues. I was scared that the alchol would overpower the vanilla, but it didnt. Smells good. Have to spray alot to get it to last tho. Maybe pour some into a smaller oil bottle to carry around through the day. Goin to try other scents from this line too! Best sweet scents i ever tried and ive been looking!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I think I lost my last one, but this stuff lasts.</li>
    <li> Our family enjoys many outdoor activities and the gnats and other itty bitty   bugs of summer are annoying....this spray smells good AND keeps those annoyances  away.</li>
    <li> My sister really wanted a large bottle of this Vanilla Body Spray for her birthday but I could only find the smaller bottles which never really last. We both have been fans of this scent since childhood and the drugstore in town never carries it so I decided to search on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spray is fantastic and lasts forever. Two days after she wore it, I could still smell it in the laundry as I washed clothes. And the compliments?? Well... what would you say if you suddenly smelled fresh baked sugar cookies and realized it was the person next to you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, great gift idea and great for the money. But...if you really want to upgrade from and \\&quot;good gift\\&quot; to a \\&quot;great gift\\&quot; take my advice and buy the bodywash and lotion as part of a set. They will love it. My sister didn&#x27;t even know that the bodywash and lotion existed in this scent. Now she wears it everyday!</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments from men on a daily with this scent. I have other scents but this one is one is a collectable for sure!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this bodyspray for over five years and it has never let me down; almost not one day goes by without out a guy complimenting on the fragrance. And for the price, definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> This body spray was by far the best smelling stuff I&#x27;ve ever used...untillllll...they changed their formula.  The original formula in the bottle which is shown was amazing; the new formula in the newly designed bottle is watered down with much less vanilla than before.  If you will compare the ingredient list, you will see the fragrance now comes third in line after the water and alcohol whereas it used to be the second ingredient after the water.  I&#x27;m very disappointed with their changes.  I will now try to locate something similar to their original aroma.  Sad that they have compromised their products.  I feel they will lose many customers besides myself which will result in a greater loss for them.</li>
    <li> I discovered this spray at a campground store many years ago. They sold it to help keep away biting gnats. It worked great. It also seems to work for mosquitoes and flies.  It is so much better to smell of vanilla than of bug sprays! My whole family uses it. No DEET for the kids this way!   I have a lot of allergies to scents but I have no problems with this one.  Love it! Love it! Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for years, and have gotten many, many compliments about it. Even long after I&#x27;ve stopped smelling it, others comment on \\&quot;something smelling really good in here\\&quot; and I just smile.  The strangest thing is that at the end of the day, this smells *just* like Cocoa Puffs cereal on me (and this isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing)!</li>
    <li> My vanilla-loving aunt&#x27;s boyfriend hated this one. I guess it wasn&#x27;t enough of a Fantasy.  Not enough like Vanilla, he said.</li>
    <li> Good product doesn&#x27;t quite smell like the original product.  Makes me sad.  I have sentimental feelings with this product.  Please go back to the original recipe.</li>
    <li> This body spray is awesome!!! I get compliments all the time about how good it smells. I recommend buying it.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t luv the smell of vanilla, this spray is heavenly.  The scent is light and refreshing, try Body Fantasies for a pleasant change from heavy scents.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  Difficult to find.  This will be a re-occurring order for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m nearly 30 and have been using this spray since my early 20s. It&#x27;s incredible, and I get so many compliments all the time from both men &amp; women. I&#x27;ve never liked fancy-pants, expensive fragrances or anything too strong. This is subtle and lovely without being too sweet or juvenile. And it&#x27;s true that it does linger for a long time. It&#x27;s really become a signature scent for me, and for only $7 or $8 a bottle! It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ll wear.</li>

The purchase went smoothly and even though the shipping was high the packing was exceptional.  I ordered two bottles, but am sure I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
    <li> perfect transaction glad to get this spray as it is my favorite, and walgrens is not carrying anymore thank you amazon,  Barbmeow</li>
    <li> great scent. great seller</li>
    <li> Very pleasant after bath splash.</li>
    <li> We live along the river and this stuff works great on gnats.  Everyone including the guys use this product. I carry it in each vehicle, the boat, it&#x27;s in the garage, the kitchen, on the deck.  Always close by.</li>
    <li> Thought I would give this product a try...I am happy to report...the scent is absolutely delicious!!    My husband noticed the smell right away and LOVED it!  I use the body wash also..great stuff for shaving your legs....smells just yummy in the tub!!    For the price I don&#x27;t know how you can beat it...will be buying this again!   LADIES...THIS IS A HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this fragrance from Walmart because I needed something to accompany the Bodycology Brown Sugar Vanilla body cream and shower gel because I didn&#x27;t see a matching fragrance. This accompanies well. I love all things vanilla. The fragrance smells like real vanilla extract and not fake, manufactured vanilla. I completely recommend this to anyone who loves vanilla!</li>
    <li> Someone wore this into the workplace the other day.  It was a smell I have encountered several times over the last year or so.  It must be very cheap to be so popular. Between the itching and the instantaneous throat tightness it is an entirely unpleasant experience.  Please, ladies (and gents?), don&#x27;t wear this stuff out of the house.</li>
    <li> Love, love this brand.  I get many compliments all the time.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I first encountered this spray in my mom&#x27;s cabinet as a little girl. When i wore it to school everybody would say \\&quot;something smells so good or like cookies\\&quot;. Well the bottle finished and i never saw it again till i was browsing online for a new set of sprays and saw this again. I have many perfumes and sprays but save this one for a special event or night out. I recieved so many compliments from this spray it is my all time favorite spray. Even the guy I&#x27;m dating love this scent so much! it&#x27;s definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> If you have not yet, try THIS or any other Vanilla body spray/perfume/eau de toillette.&lt;br /&gt;I have received complimetns from guys for wearing vanilla scent. Vanilla is highly likely to get your man noticing you ( or if you&#x27;re not with a man and looking, some are likely to pay notice to you ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, I came to find vanilla scent to be the only one I really want to wear regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deserves waaaaaaay beyond 5 stars!</li>
    <li> This is what I always wear but it&#x27;s so popular they are always sold out at the local drugstores.</li>
    <li> Vanilla Fantasy is all I have worn for the past 3 years, however, in January of this year when I ordered 6 bottles.....it had no frangrance at all.  I complained to Amazon and was advised this seems to be a frequent issue now.  I will not pay for an inferior product.  Makes me sad, as in the past wearing it I received many compliments on its fresh smell.</li>
    <li> I get more compliaments using this product.  I have been wearing Vanilla Fantasy for quite a while and am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The Vanilla spray is $26.00 when all the rest of them are $6.29??? This has to be a misprint! I know the body fantasy sprays have been discontinued in almost all of the stores and they are hard to find but that is quite a price hike for just one scent when all the others are so much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m doing reviews now because I forgot how much I miss this scent! I have to re-order more now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years- makes me smell like a cinnamon bun.</li>
    <li> ANYTHING VANILLA IS MY STYLE, AND YES I WOULD RECOMMEND THE PERFUME TO OTHERS, THIS IS OUTSTANDING PERFUME, I ENJOY THE SCENT, AND I DEFIANTLY AM INTERESTED IN PURCHASING MORE</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I used to be able to buy it locally, but now have to order it.</li>
    <li> she smells like fresh baked cookies</li>
    <li> This body spray is a great product and for a great price. Not all stores carry the product but glad I could find it on Amazon. Came in good condition and will order again someday.</li>
