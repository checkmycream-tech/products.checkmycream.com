      <li>Makes it look shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>But I love it.</li>
      <li>but I imagine it would make curly hair look lovely and frizz-free too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for about a year and love it</li>
      <li>I love all the Biomega products, just not a fan of this one.</li>
      <li>Will order some more</li>
      <li>This gel works okay,</li>
      <li>For my hair, this is the best hair styling product out there and the only one I will use.  </li>
      <li>and I love it ,</li>
      <li>I love all things Aquage.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It does not take much and is best to use after your normal wash and condition in the morning but can be used to touch up throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>I shake the tube before each use, but several times thats not helped.&lt;br /&gt;I would love to give this a five because when it&#x27;s a good bottle, it&#x27;s great on both curly and straight hair days.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how it will work on other hair types but its perfect for me.</li>
      <li>I have fine, frizzy, wavy hair.</li>
      <li>It does smooth your hair and help with styling.</li>
      <li>Again, I had hoped it would smooth my hair, help soften the frizz, but did not perform.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair smooth and shiny</li>
      <li>I got a free sample of this product from my saloon.</li>
      <li>It washes out cleanly too.</li>
      <li>Still, after using it after every wash, it doesn&#x27;t make it super silky and smooth like it is supposed to.</li>
      <li>i love the real product</li>
      <li>I requested a full refund.</li>
      <li>I use this regularly and love it!</li>
      <li>I really think that it helps smooth my hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and this product protects my hair from the heat of the blow dryer and keeps it from frizzing even on high humidity days.</li>
      <li>This is a very good gel for somebody that likes their hair soft and natural without the extra hold.  </li>
      <li>I have fine thin hair and this stops the fly aways creating a smoothing finish before spraying it in to place.</li>
      <li>I can either let it dry on it&#x27;s own or can use a hair dryer if I am in a rush.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t have to use more than a little bit, and it leaves my hair soft, curly, and feels nice to the touch even as it dries.  </li>
      <li>First tried it when my hairdresser used it on my hair.  </li>
      <li>I have used this product for about 2 years, got the first one from my hair stylist.</li>
      <li>I bought this the first time around at a salon.</li>
      <li>but this really helps to minimize that even when I let my hair dry on its own, which I do about 95% of the time.</li>
      <li>This makes it smooth and soft without having to use too much product.</li>
      <li>I requested a full refund as I had some of the real Behave left over from a salon I originally tried it at and compared it to the stuff I received from Amazon.</li>
      <li>FAST SHIPPING.</li>
      <li>The real Behave deserves 4 stars.</li>
      <li>Some don&#x27;t help much, some do</li>
      <li>when i use it on wet hair they&#x27;re more flexible and not fuzzy.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
      <li>As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s the same thing I buy for more money from my hairdresser.</li>
      <li>It works extremely well with straightening irons, that&#x27;s how you get the most shine and silkiness -</li>
      <li>It works but is really priced too high.</li>
      <li>The product works okay, but smells different than the last tube purchased at a salon.</li>
      <li>If you want your hair to act normal in high humidity weather, you need to get this product.  </li>
      <li>There was also residual product in my hair after a few washes which was great because it lasted so long and still looked great--and makes the product last longer!  </li>
      <li>was yellowed like it had been in a sunny window or was very old.  </li>
      <li>Makes my hair manageable and very soft to the touch.  </li>
      <li>My hairdresser used this product on my hair and it made it so soft!</li>
      <li>It makes my hair so soft!</li>
      <li>It does not weigh your hair down and leaves it quite smooth.</li>
      <li>Just like pretty much every other hair product I&#x27;ve tried, this product didn&#x27;t live up to the hype everyone else seems to be experiencing, but I do like the product.</li>
      <li>My hair was still soft and natural looking---no crust or grease!  </li>
      <li>The real product is clear and the product from Amazon has a milky white consistency.</li>
      <li>The product varies from creamy and light in color to oily, heavy &amp; yellow-clear in appearance.</li>
      <li>The real product looks and smells different than the product sold from on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have naturally some friz in my hair</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair that loves to frizz.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff...as long as I have long curly hair I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I really think that it helps smooth my hair. Just be careful where and who you buy It from. I usually get it at a salon but got it on amazon the last time and the product consistency is different and it separates In the bottle which is weird. I think people are selling old product online.</li>
    <li> I have &amp;#34;Harry Potter&amp;#34; type hair (grows straight up) and it calms it down in the extreme humidity of the southern US Climate.</li>
    <li> Behave changed everything about restoring life and shine and moisture to my hair.  My hair is completely white, two processed to a dark blonde and highlights, a bit of natural wave and curl, and this product tames it all.  If you have just $20 to spend on a treatment, make it this one.  You will not need anything else.  But stock up on it - it is not always easy to get!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair that loves to frizz.  This product keeps it under control!</li>
    <li> I have very thick, very coarse hair and it&#x27;s the best smoother/tamer I&#x27;ve found for the price. Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this only a 3 because the product is inconsistent. I&#x27;ve ordered or bought it retail about 6 times now. The product varies from creamy and light in color to oily, heavy &amp; yellow-clear in appearance. I shake the tube before each use, but several times thats not helped.&lt;br /&gt;I would love to give this a five because when it&#x27;s a good bottle, it&#x27;s great on both curly and straight hair days. It does not weigh your hair down and leaves it quite smooth. It washes out cleanly too. Unfortunately, this cannot be counted on with each bottle.</li>
    <li> The second product by this company that was recommended to me, but is a clear disappointment. Again, I had hoped it would smooth my hair, help soften the frizz, but did not perform. I am sorry, Aquage...</li>
    <li> Great product. Leaves my hair smooth and shiny</li>
    <li> I have half-straight, half-wavy hair that frizzes up and &#x27;fros out like crazy in the summer humidity. My stylist introduced me to Behave and it&#x27;s like a miracle - makes my hair look like a curtain of silk, so shiny and polished looking, even in the worst heat and humidity. It smells wonderful too. It works extremely well with straightening irons, that&#x27;s how you get the most shine and silkiness - but I imagine it would make curly hair look lovely and frizz-free too.</li>
    <li> If you want your hair to act normal in high humidity weather, you need to get this product.  It is amazing.  I use this and Aquage uplifting foam and it makes my hair look fuller with no frizz!  Will order some more</li>
    <li> awesome product for making your hair smooth</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and this product protects my hair from the heat of the blow dryer and keeps it from frizzing even on high humidity days.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 2 years, got the first one from my hair stylist. I use it after I wash/condition and after I squeeze out the excess water from my hair I work a pea size amount into my hair and put my hair in a hair towel.  I can either let it dry on it&#x27;s own or can use a hair dryer if I am in a rush.  I have naturally some friz in my hair but this really helps to minimize that even when I let my hair dry on its own, which I do about 95% of the time. This also helps when I am in humid weather...</li>
    <li> I have coarse, wavy hair. This makes it smooth and soft without having to use too much product. Will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in product  --- i had to throw it away.  It was not what i had purchased in my salon.  it was clear instead of whitish and the outside of the tube was yellowed like it had been in a sunny window or was very old.  one of the tubes i bought practically blew up when i opened it all over the floor  ---  the solution was hard to clean up like i had spilled a bottle of olive oil.  i love the real product and hopefully i can find it in a salon again.</li>
    <li> This seems to be watered down. It doesn&#x27;t have the same effectiveness as the one I buy in my salon! Buyers beware!</li>
    <li> Sophie&#x60;s Room product was nothing compaired to the product i got through my old hairstylist. It was runny, clear, &amp; gave me dandriff, when it is suppose to be white &amp; have the texture of shampoo. Not to mention the back of the bottle was yellow, like it was old or reused. I will not be buying from this seller ever again!</li>
    <li> FAST SHIPPING. Best stuff ever.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product on Amazon! I was foolish and did not listen to the reviews. Spend the time and buy it at a salon. The real product looks and smells different than the product sold from on Amazon. The real product is clear and the product from Amazon has a milky white consistency. Both perform differently too. The real Behave deserves 4 stars. I requested a full refund as I had some of the real Behave left over from a salon I originally tried it at and compared it to the stuff I received from Amazon. I am not going to pay for fake product.</li>
    <li> Just like pretty much every other hair product I&#x27;ve tried, this product didn&#x27;t live up to the hype everyone else seems to be experiencing, but I do like the product. I have long, dry, wavy hair, and I think using this did extend the health of my ends from my last haircut, though my ends ended up getting brittle after a while. Still, after using it after every wash, it doesn&#x27;t make it super silky and smooth like it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> I love all things Aquage.  I have tried a ton of products over the years and I have found Aquage to be the very best solution for my hair.</li>
    <li> I hate giving Aquage Biomega Behave a negative review but I feel that I must warn others.  I have used and LOVED this product for two years.  The real product is wonderful but this is not it.  This last tube that I ordered through Amazon from an outside seller IS NOT Aquage Biomega Behave.  It came in a tube that looked right, but the smell was wrong, the color was wrong, the texture was wrong and the product clearly did not work the same.  I am terribly disappointed at the waste of money and I&#x27;m afraid to order it from Amazon anymore.</li>
    <li> Great product and service</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works well on frizzy, color damaged hair.  First tried it when my hairdresser used it on my hair.  Now on my second tube.</li>
    <li> Great heat protectant.  The tube lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> But, it is way way overpriced. Will I order it again at this price? I am not sure yet. But I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s the same thing I buy for more money from my hairdresser.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair lay down and not frizz up like it did before.  Makes it look shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> It works but is really priced too high.</li>
    <li> Works miracles on my wavy/frizzy hair!  I love it.  Smells wonderful too.</li>
    <li> Fabulous!  It makes my hair so soft!</li>
    <li> love this product. Received it in the mail in about a week.</li>
    <li> If you have frizzy hairs when its humid, this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by my hairdresser and works great</li>
    <li> love the product. cheaper at my hairdresser!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair limp and dirty after less than 1 day.</li>
    <li> Buyer Beware!! This was not the real deal, smelled different and looked different from the one I bought from salon. I requested a full refund.</li>
    <li> This product is great when I&#x27;m in a hurry and just need a quick style. I have fine/ wavy hair that gets frizzy if I don&#x27;t style it. If I&#x27;m in a hurry I can just run a little of this through damp hair and it lasts all day without getting crusty.</li>
    <li> I put a little on my wet hair and blow dry.  Makes my hair manageable and very soft to the touch.  Great product !!</li>
    <li> The stuff is great does wonders for Florida Humity</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for frizzy hair.  I live in Austin Texas and have tried countless products.  It does not take much and is best to use after your normal wash and condition in the morning but can be used to touch up throughout the day.  It also has no harsh chemicals and it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I use this product daily and it works well with my ceramic straightening iron.  I cannot purchase this product locally so what a great find.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduce me to this product and I love it ,when i use it on wet hair they&#x27;re more flexible and not fuzzy.&lt;br /&gt;All you have to use is one little drop,so this tube wil last me for a long time,Thank you.</li>
    <li> The best product I have used in a long time, I have thick hair and it is hard to find a product that smooths hair and stays there naturally.</li>
    <li> Great styling tool, does great to help control frizz.</li>
    <li> Reliable delivery. I have used product before. It leaves a nice shine and de frizzy my hair. It is a great product</li>
    <li> Great product. Came quicker than I thought.</li>
    <li> I am soooo not a hair product fan...nothing I try ever works...products are usually sticky or greasy and just plain gross looking. My hair stylist used this on my hair and I fell in love!!  It&#x27;s amazing.  My hair is frizzy usually and this made it look sleek and shiny! Just gorgeous!  My hair was still soft and natural looking---no crust or grease!  There was also residual product in my hair after a few washes which was great because it lasted so long and still looked great--and makes the product last longer!  Needless to say I just bought some for myself!  can be hard to get I hear, and this is the only listing on Amazon...otherwise you have to get it through a stylist.</li>
    <li> This gel works okay, probably would not order again due to the smell and consistency. I love all the Biomega products, just not a fan of this one. It does smooth your hair and help with styling.</li>
    <li> The product works okay, but smells different than the last tube purchased at a salon. Don&#x27;t know if I would trust buying this again. ??</li>
    <li> I have really curly hair that is hard to tame.  This works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before and it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is a very good gel for somebody that likes their hair soft and natural without the extra hold.  My hairdresser gave one tube to me and I like it.  I bought two myself.</li>
    <li> I bought this the first time around at a salon. It puts the finishing touch on my sometimes crazy hair. It&#x27;s one of the first hair products I&#x27;ve actually stuck with long enough to need to reorder! I saved a couple of bucks with Amazon.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this product on my hair and it made it so soft! After receiving my product, it seems always the exact amount comes out each day for use - less waste!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about a year and love it so when I get low I re-order because no one locally sells it.</li>
    <li> This item can&#x27;t be found in any beauty salon. If you ask for it, it takes forever to get it. I was very happy to find it here. Give it a shot, it is really an excellent product!</li>
    <li> For my hair, this is the best hair styling product out there and the only one I will use.  It provides a softness and control I don&#x27;t get with other products.  I let my hair dry naturally as it is coarse and tends to frizz.  Not so with this product... Don&#x27;t have to use more than a little bit, and it leaves my hair soft, curly, and feels nice to the touch even as it dries.  I would recommend totally to anyone considering purchasing.</li>
    <li> I got a free sample of this product from my saloon. I&#x27;ve tried lots of smoothing products over the years. Some don&#x27;t help much, some do but they weigh your hair down or make it look greasy. I used this stuff and thought ummm, where have you been all my life?! I have fine, frizzy, wavy hair. I don&#x27;t know how it will work on other hair types but its perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Auqage Biomega products are the BEST!  I have fine thin hair and this stops the fly aways creating a smoothing finish before spraying it in to place.</li>
    <li> I use this regularly and love it!</li>
    <li> Wife loves this product.  When she was running out, she milked the tube until there was nothing left.  Her gift arrived just about the time she was scraping the inside of the tube for the last tiny remnant.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair smell good and leaves it smooth.  Not the best product but it works well enough for the price.</li>
