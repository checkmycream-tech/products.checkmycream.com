      <li>Best eyebrow powder ive used so far.</li>
      <li>Brushes are very useful, wax could be better, but still cheaper than most eyebrow kits and works great</li>
      <li>First time using brow powder and it works great.</li>
      <li>The brushes are fine too, but I just prefer my own angled brush for application.</li>
      <li>so much more easier to blend</li>
      <li>and I get more compliments then ever..  </li>
      <li>The color I got is more of a filler than a detailing or defining color, and the wax lasts all day.</li>
      <li>Cheap stuff!</li>
      <li>I have used many products to fill in my eyebrows, including pencils and gels.  </li>
      <li>Great product, thanks...</li>
      <li>Love the shade and everything.</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>NYX products take up more and more room in my makeup drawer</li>

      <li>I love this product and wish I had discovered it years ago.</li>
      <li>My brows have never looked better.</li>
      <li>Glad I bought this.</li>
      <li>but it really works great for brows.....</li>
      <li>(it does) make the eyebrow hairs behave better, but it just looks way too shiny for me</li>
      <li>I love the colors and the packaging.</li>
      <li>So much better than eye pencil.</li>
      <li>But I was looking for something more dense since I like to wing out the end and make my eyebrows more articulate-looking.</li>
      <li>,It great for me, I like it so much</li>
      <li>I purchased this product, thinking I was just getting a better color for fill-in.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the purchase due to the color and great price.</li>
      <li>this product made it so simple and easy to make my eyebrows look perfect</li>
      <li>But you can use a separate applicator and be fine. :)</li>
      <li>So other than the angled brush I recommend this, its adorable and the perfect travel size for on-the-go brow touch-ups.</li>
      <li>A very good filler for those who already have enough eyebrow hairs.</li>
      <li>they look natural and well-shaped :) Thanks to Nyx :D</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had been using another eyebrow pencil for years on my thinning brows. I was ok with that for the most part, but had been increasingly frustrated with the uneven color and crumbly specks. I found this highly rated and reasonably priced NYX, so thought I should try it out. I had read other reviews about the too short brush, so I purchased an NYX brush with a long handle but same bristle width as the one included in the compact. My first try with the angled brush was a little challenging, but with practice, I pretty much mastered my own technique. You do have to keep swiping the brush into the powder because each swipe doesn&#x27;t go to far. I did not mind that. After applying the color (it comes with two, but I only used the more reddish tone), you roll the spiral wire brush in the wax, and lightly apply that over the brows. This not only tames unruly hairs, but you can drag it with a little more pressure to lighten or blend some areas. A little trick I came up with is to take a 1/4&amp;#34; wide brush, spray lightly until damp with any hairspray and apply to finished brows until you feel the moisture on your skin. Do in a moderately light touch so as not to remove any color. It really helps protect your brows and the color stays longer. I would buy again!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I will never use an eyebrow pencil again. First product that makes me look like I have nice eyebrows.</li>
    <li> I like this brow filler, just be prepared with another brush since the one provided is way too hard.</li>
    <li> First time I used something like this and I get more compliments then ever..  And you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE NYX products, and I love this cute little brow kit. It does come it lighter and darker colors, but this was perfect for me, I&#x27;m light/fair complected and dye my blond hair an auburn/burgundy and it matches well. It would have received a five-star rating from me if I wasn&#x27;t so disappointed with the little angled brush. The bristles are made from plastic and not from an animal hair or synthetic hair, and seems like instead of being cut into the angled shape, it was burned into it. So it doesn&#x27;t pick up powder, but does work ok with the brow wax, so it&#x27;s not completely useless. The little spoolie brush is made from the same material but works just fine for it&#x27;s size. So other than the angled brush I recommend this, its adorable and the perfect travel size for on-the-go brow touch-ups.</li>
    <li> Awesome quality and great and easy to use! Bought on a recommendation and glad I did!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing - I don&#x27;t use the tools it came with but I use a thin elf makeup brush</li>
    <li> I usually use Ditzy but couldn&#x27;t find any available at the moment on Amazon, so I purchased this. I like it a lot and found it worked great. Would definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by how natural this eyebrow powder looks. I am a brunette but my eyebrows are black (black pencil and powder looks too harsh). This color is perfect to fill in gaps/perfect your brow (I tend to overpluck sometimes). I love  it!! I definitely prefer over an eyebrow pencil.</li>
    <li> If you know how to use it it&#x27;s work really well</li>
    <li> This product is really cheap and you can tell when you get it.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with an angled eyebrow brush and spooly brush which are both made of hard plastic material.&lt;br /&gt;The pigment has a red tint and the darkest powder is actually pretty light when applied.&lt;br /&gt;If you have light brown hair, it would work. Or red hair, it would be even better.&lt;br /&gt;However, brunettes and black haired girls will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good product. Blend is good for my hair and skin. I have dark brownish-basically tanned- skin with auburn colored hair. You can blend two colors to find the best that suits your skin tone naturally.</li>
    <li> Great product, thanks...</li>
    <li> I love them! Fast shipping! Thanks a bunch!</li>
    <li> The product is way too dark and is hard to get on. I would try the blonde next, but afraid that too will be too dark. I&#x27;m a medium brown just to let all know and this didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> It was not posible to pass trhough customs dueto internal regulation of Health Minister</li>
    <li> Great eyebrow powder.</li>
    <li> I like the product and that it had brushes to apply but it arrived broken.</li>
    <li> I have used many products to fill in my eyebrows, including pencils and gels.  I have found this to be the most effective.  I apply the gel part first with the mascara-wand looking tool.  Then I fill in the sparse parts with the dark color only (I have light brown hair) and then brush them once more with the wand to make sure they&#x27;re the right shape.  I think it looks very natural, and I even had someone compliment my eyebrows the other day.  She said &amp;#34;Your eyebrows are so nice!  You don&#x27;t even have to fill them in, do you?&amp;#34; so I guess others can&#x27;t tell either.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Best eyebrow powder ive used so far. I definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Worked great! Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed!  After reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  The colors are off and the product is junk!  Even though I blot the powder, it still crumbles and gets all over my face.  Cheap stuff!</li>
    <li> I normally use a similar product by e.l.f. and thought I&#x27;d give this one a try. The application and look were consistent with what I wanted, slightly better definition than my previous brow combo. However, this stuff stayed tacky all day! It never dried! I did not like that feeling and having to constantly worry if my brows had smudged.</li>
    <li> The wax does little for my eyebrows. The powder applies OK and takes awile to show up. However I like how there are two tones of eyebrow powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hate the little angled brush that it come with. It&#x27;s not angled at all; it&#x27;s cut straight across and is really hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product if you&#x27;re traveling and want to pack lightly on your makeup.</li>
    <li> This brow kit does a nice job of filling in and smoothing down brows. Brunette colors match well, not too dark, not too light.</li>
    <li> A very good filler for those who already have enough eyebrow hairs. But I was looking for something more dense since I like to wing out the end and make my eyebrows more articulate-looking.</li>
    <li> Much darker than I had expected. It doesn&#x27;t come off easily which is good for long wear, but absolutely terrible if you mess up or need to fix a spot.</li>
    <li> This beats using the brow pencils any day! so much more easier to blend and the wax helps those stray hairs stay in place along with the color being flattering and matching of my hair color. I would recommend this over the pencil.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good substitute for the pencil. I like using it!</li>
    <li> One of the best products out there, awesome!!</li>
    <li> Product sticks to skin and isn&#x27;t workable.</li>
    <li> This eyebrow set took me a while to get the hang of how to use since I hardly have any eyebrows. I youtubed some ladies who made tutorials on how to use this &amp;#34;properly&amp;#34; and I have made perfect eyebrows since. The two brushes that come with this kit are helpful, but if you have your own I would recommend using those because these are sooo small. Overall, this is a great kit and you can basically achieve any look you want with this. I like to make ombré eyebrows with this kit. I will be buying again!</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted. The color is great. I don&#x27;t really use the wax because I have a wax pencil but the brushes are great.</li>
    <li> March 2015 update :  I have had the same pallet for almost a year now.  I may not apply make up as much as others.  But I this is lasting me a cold while.  It works great helping to color in my naturally blond eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;April 2015: First time using brow powder and it works great.</li>
    <li> it was in good condition, there was no sign of damaged  and it arrived the day it stated. I like it makes my eyebrow look natural since I don&#x27;t have much eyebrow hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, worked exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> Five things in a tiny box! Worth its price :) My brow doesn&#x27;t look too dark with this. :D they look natural and well-shaped :) Thanks to Nyx :D</li>
    <li> The powder looks all smudged on when you apply it. I am not pleased with nyx products so far. I&#x27;ve also tried the pencil and it looks too rough.</li>
    <li> Exactly what was expected and arrived perfectly. Color is as pictured.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I use it every day! I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves NYX products, this is perfect!</li>
    <li> get it for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;love the brushes</li>
    <li> I have very thin brows.  This helped to fill them in and define them.  Other similar products were much more expensive.</li>
    <li> Before that I used a pencil eyebrows. Now I change to use this,It great for me, I like it so much, It looks extremely natural.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with the purchase due to the color and great price.</li>
    <li> Colors are really nice for filling in or creating brows without the dark harsh look. The brush is not stiff enough to create a shape. You need to have or purchase a brush.</li>
    <li> Good product; will buy again</li>
    <li> My brows have never looked better. As good as the brow bar to go and way less expensive! I love the little wax stuff</li>
    <li> did not like how i look with it, you pay what you get for, just didn&#x27;t like product texture, thanks anyway</li>
    <li> fairly hard to apply and the color doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
    <li> I love this, easy to use, perfect colors and a great price! I bought a second one for my sister.</li>
    <li> This item is easy to use, its shades are perfect and the wand and gel to tame my brows are terrific.</li>
    <li> Love the shade and everything.</li>
    <li> not bad, not great either.</li>
    <li> I think this product is great!! It is a great price and works well.  I bought a larger slanted brush and that is what I recommend.  I do not use the wax at all and the product still stays on.</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> The NYX Eyebrow Cake Powder adds a bit of color to your eyebrows which is particularly nice if your brows are beginning to fade due to maturity. Application is easy as I&#x27;ve only used the powder not the wax, and the powder seems to stay put throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
    <li> My only problem is being able to apply the wax so it doesn&#x27;t extend beyond my eyebrow. I gave up and don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> The actual product, the brow powder, is a very nice shade and is the perfect color to go with my hair. However, the brush given with the powder is not flat and thin enough. It should be more thin and sturdy so that the user of the product can replicate hair like marks on the brows. The spooley included is nice and useful. I&#x27;m not very please with the wax, because it&#x27;s sticky, gets everywhere, and makes my eyebrows weirdly shiny. Okay product overall.</li>
    <li> I am not exactly sure why this is rated so highly. It&#x27;s ok, but you can really see the color on the brows in my opinion. It&#x27;s one of those colors that when you walk in the sunlight, you immediately realize how obvious it is that you filled in your brows (if that makes sense). Anyway, it&#x27;s ok if you blend it really well and use it very sparingly!</li>
    <li> This has become my favorite new product. I actually have curly eyebrows and the wax in this set keeps them put where they are supposed to be. I love the two different shades of brown that come with it as sometimes I want my eyebrows filled in more dramatically than others. I will absolutely be buying more of this product.</li>
    <li> I love the colors and the packaging.</li>
    <li> Just tried this for the first time,I love this powered eyebrow makeup,it fills in my sparse eyebrows nicely &amp; looks natural!!lt also seems to last longer than the Maybelline I have used for years, BUT the darker brown color is too dark &amp; the lighter brown color,(which is really a medium color brown)well they&#x27;re just isn&#x27;t much of it, I like the wax (it does) make the eyebrow hairs behave better, but it just looks way too shiny for me,I hate the tiny brush so I have a long brush, that I always use&lt;br /&gt;so all in all,it&#x27;s great, but won&#x27;t last me near as long as my regular Maybelline,so I&#x27;m not sure if I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> super easy and great quality! love it</li>
    <li> I love this product, I didn&#x27;t even realize I was missing eyebrow powder till I started using this and now I love it! Easy to use and looks great with my dark brunette hair!</li>
    <li> I have been using this and another brow pencil and my brows look perfect.</li>
    <li> Great product, perfect colors.  I have medium-dark brown hair and the color match my hair perfectly.  The brushes are fine too, but I just prefer my own angled brush for application.</li>
    <li> I ordered this accepted a bigger amount. the overall thing came in a shoe box size but the compact itself can fit in my palm. it&#x27;s a very small amount for the price I paid. even the brushes were half the size of my finger. the powder is cheap and I def won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Bit clumpy and blends well.</li>
    <li> I use this with the NYX Eyebrow Wax pencil. My eyebrows look great and more defined. I&#x27;m using the lighter of the two shades in this case and it looks good. The darker one would probably be too dark - I think the wax also enhances the color and makes it darker. The next time I buy -  I&#x27;ll try one shade lighter. Excellent product and you don&#x27;t have to use very much at all.</li>
    <li> I think this powder is much easier to apply and more natural looking than a pencil. It includes eyebrow wax and a spiral brush to keep the powder in place and your eyebrows tamed and trained.</li>
    <li> Glad I bought this. Nice pigments. NYX products take up more and more room in my makeup drawer</li>
    <li> When I ordered this, I had no idea that I would be receiving three items, and the powders appeared to be much lighter in the photos online than they are in person</li>
    <li> I liked it however dosnt match so can&#x27;t use it.. But dosnt blend well or I just suck at trying to do eyebrows .. Lol</li>
    <li> This product works well, even if you have very little hair in the eyebrow area.  Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t look fake, and stays on.  Once you fix the &#x27;sparse eyebrows&#x27; problem, you will be amazed at how this one simple thing improves your look.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have thin eyebrows &amp; this product works really well to fill them in.  I don&#x27;t always use the wax.  Works fine either way. Both shades works well on me.  I use the lighter one in spring &amp; summer.  The darker one for fall &amp; winter.  I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> just as I expected. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Love it!  One of the best purchases I have ever made.  How have I not heard of this until now?  I have medium golden brown hair and this shade has been perfect.</li>
    <li> Great for eyebrows very happy. Brushes are very useful, wax could be better, but still cheaper than most eyebrow kits and works great</li>
    <li> This works gret nod is nice and to. I would definitely recommend this and AMAZON has it at an amazing price.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price</li>
    <li> Really like the brow wax and two colors, plus tools.  Both shades can be mixed or used alone.  Everything you need for shading and styling your brows!</li>
    <li> This is the right color if I mix them together and gives a great look! Can not beat the price. I cannot tell you how many types of eyebrow &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; I have wasted money on. The only thing is I don&#x27;t use the cream that comes with it. I don&#x27;t even know how it&#x27;s supposed to be used but I think it works all day just by itself.</li>
    <li> It was easy to put on and tamed the longer hairs of my eyebrows, so that it looked like an arched eyebrow everyone has been sporting.  Like it, but, wished it wasn&#x27;t so hard to put on the applicator.</li>
    <li> So much better than eye pencil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a pencil user and filled in with some eyebrow powder.  I purchased this product, thinking I was just getting a better color for fill-in.  As soon as I received it, I figured it may just be a good standalone eyebrow product, so I tried it solo and I was pleasantly surprised. I was also surprised that it held up...all day long.  No reapplication necessary.  No more eyebrow pencils for me.  Now I spend less time filling in my brows and they look so much more natural.  I love this product and wish I had discovered it years ago.</li>
    <li> Love it! Makes my eyebrows look amazing!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I had to look up online how to use it. So the only thing I would change is directions being packed with it. But be does that it was easy and my brows look great!</li>
    <li> The brown powder is a good color for me. Also I like the wax a lot, but I&#x27;m going to run out long before I&#x27;m out of the powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the brow comb, although it is a little hard to grab from inside the container. To apply the powder I use a brush from real Techniques, which is MUCH better than the brush in the kit. (The brush in the kit is totally stiff.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t take too long to apply, and looks more natural than a brow stick on me.</li>
    <li> Love this product so much im new to doing my eyebrows and this product made it so simple and easy to make my eyebrows look perfect i&#x27;ve tired other products as well but nothing has given me the results i wanted untill i tried this never going back !</li>
    <li> Difficult to find this kind of cake powder for eyebrows.  Love it!</li>
    <li> lil oily but just damp it with a cotton ball other than that i love this and with order again</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a strange product.  I&#x27;ve used other eyebrow powders and this is just different.  It&#x27;s not like a powder.  I think it&#x27;s greasy.  I don&#x27;t know but I&#x27;m afraid to try it again.  It feels and looks like it won&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
    <li> I like this....at first I was hesitant on the wax and color...but it really works great for brows.....I wear a med brown and it is just right.</li>
    <li> The colors aren&#x27;t quite what I was expecting, but I like it overall.</li>
    <li> As described. No complaints</li>
    <li> Not sure how I&#x27;ve been able to survive without this product! Adds a touch a glamour I didn&#x27;t expect.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good just don&#x27;t rub your eyebrow area or will come off.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My eyebrows look natural. The color is perfect. Very easy to use especially if you have a brow stencil. Don&#x27;t let the price fuel you this eyebrow cake powder is high quality and the best I ever used.</li>
    <li> Not much to say except that it&#x27;s a great product and you have everything you need for your eyebrows in a little pack. You can never go wong with Nyx especially since the quality is much higher. I love it!</li>
    <li> never used an eyebrow powder before......like it.  Stays on all day.  Nice color;  love the light and darker brown...thanks.</li>
    <li> The only problem is that the applicators are very short and makes difficult the application of the product. But you can use a separate applicator and be fine. :)</li>
    <li> The comb is the best part of this! The brush is a bit too stiff but I use my own for most cases. The color I got is more of a filler than a detailing or defining color, and the wax lasts all day. Remove before bed or risk a surprise in the morning, whoops! Worth the price.</li>
    <li> perfect color. my hair is dark brown, and ive always been told eyebrows should be a shade or two lighter for girls with dark brown hair. shipping was fast. smaller than expected, but it was a cheap price so what can I say?</li>
    <li> Love this, excellent to fill in my light/medium brown brows. Can&#x27;t beat the brice</li>
    <li> i really don&#x27;t know how to apply it so I just brushed it on and that seemed to work.  don&#x27;t know what to do with the white stuff, there were no directions.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a year ago, use it a couple times a week, and haven&#x27;t had to replace it yet. I have medium/dark brown hair, and the lighter of the shades is perfect. A few problems, though: I have to use more than I think I should to get good coverage, it tends to come off / smear easily, and the angled brush is too wide. I only continue to use it because the color is good and I don&#x27;t want to waste the money by throwing it out.</li>
    <li> Love it! Will order again.</li>
    <li> Does a great job.  Works best if you use your own eyebrow brush and not the one that comes with the kit.&lt;br /&gt;2nd time I have ordered this.</li>
    <li> No comments on this product.</li>
    <li> Great price and alternative to more expensive brands. I use a softer small brow brush to apply it then brush it out with the brow comb included to make it look natural. I have darker blonde/light brown hair and mainly use the darker shade of the brunette palette sparingly with no wax.</li>
