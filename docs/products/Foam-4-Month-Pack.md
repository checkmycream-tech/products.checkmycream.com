      <li>Just a little squirt and your mouth feels clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>but I think the gel might be a little better.</li>
      <li>first purchase was gret, this seems to be something different...</li>
      <li>/&gt;Too early to know if it works as advertised.</li>

    <li> This item does exactly what is claimed.</li>
    <li> I love this product; it is exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use this all the time for fresh breath and a clean tongue.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t be without it. Wish it was sold in more stores!</li>
    <li> I discovered this product with the tongue cleaner a few months ago at CVS.  Always concerned with oral hygiene I gave it a try and really liked this as an added part to my regime.  As luck would have it, they have stopped (appears to be) carrying it in CVS, Walgreens, anywhere in my area.  So online I go to find the foam and find that it is much cheaper.  Almost half the price.  It was $7.39 for 1 in the store vs the pack of 4 for $14.99 + shipping of $2.99.  Great deal and I am glad to know it&#x27;s not off the market.  Gives you a clean fresher feeling after brushing your teeth in the morning.</li>
    <li> This is very good. Makes the cleaning pleasant and effective. Treat it like soap for your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true you could use something else or nothing at all but the results are not the same.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product! I have tried dozens of different mouth washes, tooth pastes. This is the only one that solved my problem, left my mouth feeling great!</li>
    <li> Great product.  It works!</li>
    <li> I have tried two different and they do not foam. It is spraying a watery liquid on the tongue and is not as effective as the original sample I tried. I will not be buying any more.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It performs exactly as described, and I am so pleased to buy it on Amazon in a multi-pack (since only one store in my area carries it and I do not shop there).  Highly recommended!</li>

    <li> Works extremely well.</li>
    <li> Ordered and was delivered right away.  This stuff works really well!</li>
    <li> 3 out of 4 dogs agree with the headline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too early to know if it works as advertised. Stay tuned.</li>
    <li> first purchase was gret, this seems to be something different...</li>
