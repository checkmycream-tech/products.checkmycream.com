      <li>Hard to find this sold separately, as I use the lotion more than the perfume.</li>
      <li>I clearly remember being at Sunglass Hut and the girl working there</li>
      <li>In addition to the scent, Passion by ET keeps my skin soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure if the lotion smells this loud, the perfume is worse.</li>
      <li>The smell suits older aged ladies bring them memories.</li>

THIS WAS HER HER FIRST&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT IN HER PERFUME LINE...WHENEVER I WEAR IT PEOPLE COMPLIMENT ME ON IT.  I WAS GLAD TO FIND IT ON AMAZON AT SUCH A LOW PRICE...WILL ORDER AGAIN FROM AMAZON!!</li>
    <li> I use lotion instead of perfume.  It can go on my neck and arms, etc., and the scent lingers ALL day.  Love the silky feel and great aroma.  I get compliments all the time, \\&quot;You smell wonderful\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> Perfect transaction! Great price and great produt!! This lotion is a little old-school but it smells so Yummy.. I get comliments all the time!</li>
    <li> one of our favorites, it has been discontinued .  we were glad to find it.</li>
    <li> This perfume has been on my to get list for a while. I clearly remember being at Sunglass Hut and the girl working there smelled great so I asked her what she was wearing and she told me Passion by ET. Sweet. Okay so I order this stuff and it is AWFUL. Maybe it just doesnt work well with my body chemistry. It was so strong and overwhelming and I couldn&#x27;t get the granny smell off of me even after showering. NOT for me but maybe for you. TEST at the store before you purchase. UGH</li>
    <li> I am glad you sell this product!I don&#x27;t like strong aromas, but the body lotion is milder. Thank You for selling it by itself.</li>
    <li> Passion products are my preference of the Elizabeth Taylor products.</li>
    <li> Great!! Thank you so much, it smelled so good. I ordered from eBay and they sent me a very old and stail product. I&#x27;ll keep you on my list to order from.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;d never tried Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s products, so I thought I would try a lotion first. This lotion is kind of loud for my taste. I&#x27;m sure if the lotion smells this loud, the perfume is worse. I have to wear just a little of it so it doesn&#x27;t  over power me.</li>

    <li> Great. My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Got one in a gift box with the perfume last Christmas. Hard to find this sold separately, as I use the lotion more than the perfume. I bought four tubes to stock up. It is very reasonably priced. Also, I have very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother me when I apply it. :)</li>

    <li> This is a great body lotion after showering, to help moisturizer your skin. I layer this with the body powder and perfume for an all day subtle fragrance. I can&#x27;t smell it after I first put it on as I&#x27;ve become somewhat used to it,  but others say it&#x27;s very light during the day and really pleasant. I use it as my signature fragrance and have had many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this stuff</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the perfume!  I can&#x27;t even use it as it just smells rancid when I put it on.</li>
    <li> This is my fragrance!!!  Very happy with the cost of body lotion.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years because it blends so well with my own sence. I add a little baby lotion to it and the mixture is heaven for me.</li>
