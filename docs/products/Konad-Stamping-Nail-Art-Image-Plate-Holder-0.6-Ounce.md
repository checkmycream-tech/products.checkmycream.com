      <li>For me, the plate holder was more of a hassle since it is just one more thing to clean the excess nail polish off of.</li>
      <li>I say that you really don&#x27;t need it to still do a good job stamping your nails.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I originally got all my Konad stuff and chose not to buy the plate holder, because it really isn&#x27;t necessary in order to use the plates. However, after a few weeks, I started getting really fed up with polish ending up everywhere, and I was running through paper towels very quickly. So I finally decided that the three bucks I spend on this, is going to actually save me money on paper towels in the long run... It finally arrived and after using my plates with this holder, I can definitely say it makes a huge difference for me, when it comes to neatness. It helps that you can rotate the plate so that the image you use is touching the extra surface, and polish comes off the surface really easily. So, to sum it up, you don&#x27;t *need* this to use the Konad plates, but you *need* this if you really want a cleaner working area when you&#x27;re using them.</li>
    <li> Works well to hold the plates in place, but I suppose that shouldn&#x27;t be too surprising seeing as it is designed to do as such. I kinda wish the bottom had a bit of texture to it to help it grip the table, but it&#x27;s entirely functional.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about needing this with my purchase of the stamper, however, it is necessary for me and makes the stamping process quick and simple.</li>
    <li> Ordered this before the holiday&#x27;s and it never arrived. I contacted the company (they did not contact me) and they stated USPS lost over 200 of their packages. If that was really the case, why didn&#x27;t they send out an email to the most recent orders to let them know?! Very disappointing. I did get a refund after I contacted them. I think this is bad business practice.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Does what it says it should BUT it is so much better just to set the plate straight onto a paper towel so when you&#x27;re done, you can just pick it all up and throw it away. I bought this without thinking and have barely used it. I would suggest not buying it and just using a paper towel! I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Love it! Helps with the accidental swipe of nailpolish onto the table or floor. Great price too. I bought two for myself.</li>
    <li> I got this image plate holder because I was new to Konad Stamping Nail Art and I wanted to make sure I got all the things that will help me use the system better. The holder is not bad but it&#x27;s not really necessary since you can place the image plates on top of a paper towel (which I still do even though I got the plate holder) and it will work fine. So if you don&#x27;t feel like you require it don&#x27;t waste the money, I gave it 4 stars because it does the job, but it&#x27;s not really a must.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if I really needed this, but it does hold the plate still while you apply polish and scrape of what is not needed.</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure if I needed this product. I&#x27;ve been using the Konad and bundle monster system just fine without it for a couple months but I finally decided it was time to try this. It works well and makes the stamping process easier and less messy but it&#x27;s not by any means a necessity when using  Konad. Long story short I&#x27;m glad that I purchased this and do recommend this product to my friends. If you have an extra $6 lying around, why not buy it and make your life easier!</li>
    <li> Had this plus the plates a long time and still love it</li>
    <li> I purchased this to hold my Konad and Monster Bundle IP&#x27;s and it does the trick. It helps on holding the plates down while scraping the excess polish off and it helps me be less messy. It is easy to wipe the polish off of the holder with regular nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> this thing sucked, i really dont know how anyone could give this a good review.  It doesnt work, i mean it works the same like putting the disks on a piece of paper, it barely keeps it still, or in place.  what , do they pay these people to write theese reviews??</li>
    <li> The Image Plate holder is a very convenient tool when using Konad.  For all you first time users out there, know that this is not essential to the process but merely quickens the process and makes it so that you can easily swipe away the excess nail polish from the scraper.  Overall I would recommend this item if you want to simplify your process but if you don&#x27;t want to spend the money you will be fine without it.</li>
    <li> This really serves no purpose. It&#x27;s supposed to hold the disc in place, but does not do that. Also, will fit any of the discs, not just the Konad ones.</li>
    <li> Great quality product.</li>
    <li> as i stated before ya this product really is not worth the money the disk never stays and its so light that when u go to you the scrapper the disk goes with u *sometimes* but if u want to have this go ahead but i see no need 4 it</li>
    <li> This holder works great, does the trick and helps out a lot! You should definitely buy it if you have the image plates because this helps out a lot and makes the job easier!</li>
    <li> My daughter saw this product in the mall. I choose to order it via Amazon instead. As soon as she opened it, she started putting Konad nails stamps on everyone. The product came on time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> The plate holder is a must, if you have konad disc&#x27;s.  It really helps hold the disc in place.  Have used the disc without it, and the disc just slid all around.  Plus, it also catehes the excess nailpolish.</li>
    <li> This plate holder is great and really cuts down on getting nail polish everywhere. You can just wipe it down with polish remover and a cotton ball after you are done with all your nails and it&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s not a nessessity to use the plates, but it&#x27;s helpful, and you don&#x27;t have to hold down the plate with your fingers. It&#x27;s also cheaper than buying it directly from konad</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use with my Konad brand stamp plates.  Considering most of the kits do not come with the holder, I was not certain I really needed one. After seeing several Youtube demos, I decided it would be helpful&lt;br /&gt;The purpose of this holder is to keep your plate stationary when needed and allow you to easily move it (without damaging your paintjob) when you need to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;If you have never stamped before and are new to all of this, I do suggest you get the holder.  It makes it easier to hold the plate steady while you scrape it.  The lip on the end allows plenty of room to hold it.  Unlike generic plates, the Konad ones do not have sharp edges, so it&#x27;s not really a safety issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about he holder is, I&#x27;d like the hole deeper.  My konad plates have a backing on them that cause it to stick up a little bit and it sometimes rotates in the holder while I clean it.  I&#x27;d like it if the holder really \\&quot;grabbed\\&quot; the plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy I ordered the holder and I use the holder every time I use a plate.</li>
    <li> I got it in a good amount of time and exactly what I saw on this site. When I first looked into buying this product I was unsure if I needed it, thinking I could just use the plate without the holder. I decided to buy it because I was new to using the plates and the price was reasonable to make the purchase. Once I got it I realized it comes in handy and I do not have to worry about holding the plate with my hand. I just wish it would come with the stamper and scraper.</li>
    <li> I ORDERED THIS KONAD STAMPING NAIL ART IMAGE PLATE HOLDER FOR MYSELF.  I LOVED IT SO MUCH I GOT 2 MORE FOR MY FRIENDS.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU GET THIS TO HELP HOLD  YOUR PLATE AND SCRATCH THE POLISH ONTO THE HOLDER.  I GIVE IT 5 STARS.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know, maybe its just me but this is just one purchase I made that was unnecessary. It just sits there as I used it one time only. Its also an extra thing to clean that makes no sense to me.</li>
    <li> Not necessary but a handy accessory for nail stamping.  It holds the templte still while transferring the desgn to the stamp.</li>
    <li> This holder does it&#x27;s job. I am able to easy swipe my BM plates as long as I hold the plate in place. Helps with cleanup cuz I don&#x27;t need to use a bunch of paper towels, I just clean the holder. It&#x27;s not necessary, but if you want to make your stamping slightly easier, get it.</li>
    <li> So this thing is basically worthless if you aren&#x27;t getting the KONAD brand image plates. I bought an off-brand set of plates (cause they were very inexpensive) and the discs are slightly too small for this plate holder. You can still use it but the plates can wiggle around so there really isn&#x27;t much point to having this thing anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can just as easily put the image plates on a paper towel and work from there instead of using this plate holder. I say that you really don&#x27;t need it to still do a good job stamping your nails.</li>
    <li> This is one extra step in the stamping process.  Not really necessary and takes up more time. It should come free when your order a certain amount of stamping plates.</li>
    <li> Love it! Does just what it&#x27;s supposed to at a great price. A must for anyone who enjoys stamping.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Don&#x27;t even bother buying it. It serves no purpose. It doesn&#x27;t even hold the plate as you scrap across it. You&#x27;re better off scraping the plate on a piece of paper or table.</li>
    <li> I got this for her and she uses it all the time. She loves it. She uses it for her nails, and she also stamps designs on alot of other things.</li>
    <li> The concept of this item is great but the disc&#x27;s don&#x27;t stay in there very well. It should be a little deeper and larger.</li>
    <li> I bought this to go along with the design set for my niece who was 12 at the time.  She said it helped with holding the plates but wasn&#x27;t easy for her to use.</li>
    <li> There were a few times using this that the plate popped out. There&#x27;s really not much to this thing. It&#x27;s not bad, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great, quick service! Will definitely order again! I received it within the specified time frame and item was exactly what I expected and it works great too!</li>
    <li> Well I bought this for my daughter and it was no big deal to her... I use it more than her!</li>
    <li> works great with the product, placed order and recieved the palte in less then a week. fast shipment and no problem with the order.</li>
    <li> I found this to be unnecessary with the bundle monster plates, maybe it is needed for the Konad ones but I just set the bundle monster plate on paper towels or newspaper and it doesn&#x27;t move. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Bundle Monster Nail Art makes stamping plates for a whole lot cheaper.    The Konad French Tip plate works fine, but the small flowers and hearts are difficult.</li>
    <li> I got the image plate holder at the same time as a bunch of image plates and all the other things you need for stamping nail art, and i love how easy and clean the whole process is. but I find the image plate holder to be almost useless. i can get just as good results from simply putting the image place on a paper tower, and then i don&#x27;t need to clean up the excess polish from the scraping when i&#x27;m done, since it&#x27;s already on something i can throw away or compost.  as far as image plate holders go, if you still want one, this one is sturdy and well made, with a hole in the back for easy removal of the plate when you&#x27;re done with it, so you don&#x27;t cut your fingers fiddling with the thin plates. so it&#x27;s a good image plate holder. but image plate holders in general re useless when doing nail stamping art.</li>
    <li> I love this product. This was a great addition to my growing Konad collection. Would recommend to anyone with nail art stamping plates.</li>
    <li> I like this now my plates don&#x27;t move. Great size and my plates fit in nicely</li>
    <li> HAVE to have one of these for stamping!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product thinking I needed it, but turns out, I didn&#x27;t.  It works well, but truth is, one can just use the stamp and image plates.  This can cut down on the mess, but that&#x27;s about it.  If one knows what they&#x27;re doing, you really don&#x27;t need it. Just use your hand to hold the plate and go for it.  The shipping and handling coupled with cost of the item just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> Ok, this does exactly what it says: nail art image plate holder. It holds stamping plates. That&#x27;s all it does.</li>
    <li> i love it it holds all type of plates &amp; makes it much easier for you to use the image plates  was worth it :)</li>
    <li> My niece loves this whole set.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE AND HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I love these days work really really good I had to check him all out they were properly wrapped I love how they came and bought three at Walmart and they could not work at these goodies where yours do and there are so many of them I just love them</li>
    <li> Nice plate was easy to use and clean up! Made it great for holding the plates! Would recommend this product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but it works great. This item is very useful and it is easy to clean. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> THIS PARTICULAR ITEM IS VERY HELPFUL WHEN USING TEMPLATES FOR NAIL DESIGNS. ITEM IS STURDY AND IS A GOOD BUY BUT NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.</li>
    <li> Love this! I just recently started getting interested in painting my nails and doing something more than just one or two basic styles. I absolutely LOVE this holder. It holds my plates in place so they don&#x27;t slide all over my table and scratch it all up.</li>
    <li> Goes along with my nail kit and it holds my plates so handy so I dont have to struggle with holding the plate and nail polish. I recommend this if you get the kit!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to nail image stamping and I wanted to be sure I picked up everything I might need; however, I did not need this. It just causes more work since I have to keep cleaning off all the nail polish that gets on it. It&#x27;s easier and less messy just to place the image plate on a paper towel or any flat surface.</li>
    <li> helpful with the nail art plates, once get some practice you may not need to use it to achieve the steadiness needed</li>
    <li> Holds the plate in place and makes it easier for the application.  A must to go along with your starter kit.</li>
    <li> this image plate holder is a must (in my opinion) it just make it easy to use the Konad Stamping Art Image Plates.. its not that expensive and it work great.</li>
    <li> A very ideal tool for stamping your nails, helps told it in place a for simple place when stamping.  This is an essential tool.</li>
    <li> This holder saves a lot of trouble when you&#x27;re scraping your plates. I didn&#x27;t think I would really need it but I have learned it really does make things stay in place and provides a clean scrape every time.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter who does nails and she loves it.  Said it was easier to use than one she had purchased.</li>
    <li> My wife used them and really enjoyed them they were very nice, and would recommend them to anyone that does nails.</li>
    <li> Holds plate steady while using and makes it easier to use the plates.  I would definitely recommend to a friend</li>
    <li> I love having this plate holder, it makes it so much easier to keep the plate in place. No worries that it might slide or tip. It is a must have if you do a lot of stamping!</li>
    <li> It actually took my longer to figure out exactly how to use this than it did to just use the plates without. It&#x27;s a nice little tool but if you are going to try nail stamping just jump in with both &amp;#34;hands&amp;#34;. It takes practice and patience whether or not you use this or do it &amp;#34;free hand&amp;#34; so to speak. Either way once you get brave enough and gain some confidence you&#x27;ll see that it saves time, nail polish and cleaning if you just skip this step. I gave it a three because there is nothing wrong with the product and if you are skittish about the whole stamping idea maybe it will give you a little boost of confidence. Or like me make it seem like a wasted and unnecessary step that seemed to make it sound more complicated than it really is.</li>
    <li> This plate holder works well to hold the plate while stamping.  This also worked with my generic nail stamping plates. The plates are sort of slick, so I am glad as a beginner that I have the plate to hold the nail stamping disks in place while I am learning to use them.</li>
    <li> I got this to put my plates on when doing stamping. I thought I&#x27;d need it but honestly have only used it a couple times as I forget to use it. It really doesn&#x27;t make a difference in using it and just setting your plate on another surface. Also its hard to clean.</li>
    <li> Some stamping plates I own are much larger then my konad ones and you honestly do not need this plate holder instead of wasting your money on this go put it towards a case that can hold all your plates which is much more lovely and usefull!! I recomend the pueen case holder they are gorgeous and totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I bought this plate holder, not sure if I really needed it since I am able to stamp my nails just fine without it. This plate holder just makes the process a little easier, it holds the plate steady so that I don&#x27;t have to think about it. I like this plate holder and enjoy using it. Is it an absolute necessity? No. But it is nice to have and I am happy that I bought it.</li>
    <li> If you have the Konad Nail plates then you will not be able to live without this. It holds the plate in place as you put the Konad polish on it and makes the scraping and stamping so much easier. Believe me, I have tried to do it without this holder and it is extremely difficult. You have to have this holder if you have the plates.</li>
    <li> I love using it because it holds the stamping plates really well, what makes easy for me to do my stamping. I love it!!! Thanks</li>
    <li> This holds the plate in place while you clear the polish. Makes nail stamping a little easier! Glad I purchased it!</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
    <li> Will be tickled when manufacturer places non-skid tabs on the bottoms so they don&#x27;t slide on slippery surfaces. Works great if you hold the holder in place while using the stamper with it. Good item for the price.</li>
    <li> They did not provide a tracking number, so I thought my package was just going to take a long time to come, but it has been almost a month and I have not received my holder.</li>
    <li> This item does save your work area from getting messy . . . those blue nail towels are expensive.  A feature no one else has mentioned is that you can also test out designs on the pink scraping area, then wipe clean with the polish as you clean off the plate.  It does hold the plate secure (I just have the Bundle Monster plates but I understand that both those and the Konad work perfectly). It&#x27;s cool, and I like it.  No you don&#x27;t have to have it, but you won&#x27;t regret having one either!!!!    Manufacturers:  Cool idea for you:  I wish there were a Konad product to hold the plates and be able to put them away like folding a book so they don&#x27;t catch dust and you can see them all at once, or nearly all at once.  And another product that could also be really neat, would be a practice board with different backgrounds with strips of major background colors, such as clear, natural, French pink and white, red, black, plum, that could wipe off with polish remover as it does on the scraper.  It would be very cool to be able to store it inside the disc storage device I am dreaming of.  Many plastics are not acetone safe; so we could use a product like this.</li>
    <li> i have absolutely no problems with this product at all..it works fine..it doesn&#x27;t fit perfectly with the bundle monster plates but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal..the only reason i give it three stars is because i personally don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary..simply putting the image plate on a paper towel or something will do..but considering the price, i purchased it</li>
    <li> Very good service would use again</li>
    <li> Bought for my granddaughter and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Arrived sooner then said. I am very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Useless, I got it because I thought it was a necessary item, but it just adds to clean up, it makes a mess out of the excess polish.</li>
    <li> This plate holder will hold your image plate in place . I can highly recommend this product . It will however only work on the round image plates.</li>
    <li> This tool truly has no use and makes it more difficult to use the stamp.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> Love konad products...</li>
    <li> These are so easy  to use that a child could use them.  They work great and are so easy to use</li>
    <li> Not much to say about this one - it does what it needs to, and holds the plates in place.  I ordered SHANY brand plates, because they had a 25-pack pretty cheap, and this was my first foray into stamping.  Loved it!  I wish the base of the holder were wider, to give you more to hold onto.  But it&#x27;s pretty easy to keep clean - I use a q-tip soaked in acetone or regular polish remover to clean out the crevices and avoid botching my fresh manicure.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m digging it! Not too bad to do my right hand, either, as a painfully un-ambidextrous person.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine trying to stamp my nails without this thing holidng the plate in place.  Comes in handy!  Glad I got it.</li>
    <li> This plate makes doing the stamping alot easier.  It holds the design wheel in place so you can use the stamping.  I would recommend getting an extra one if you have multiple people doing their nails at the same time.</li>
    <li> I got the image plate holder, because it was cheap and I wanted to ensure that the stamping process would be as efficient as possible. Firstly, the holder is made from a strong, stiff plastic. It won&#x27;t bend and it&#x27;s not flimsy. I got some plates from Bundle Monster and they fit perfectly. I&#x27;ve found the holder very useful as a place on which to rest the scraper inbetween stamping. Place your image plate so that the image you want to stamp is closest to the flat surface, then scrape onto the open plastic surface. The plate holder is cleaned easily with nail polish remover (I use pure acetone). You can do your stamping without the plate holder, but for the price, I think the holder is a really useful addition to your stamping kit.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my first nail art kit. It&#x27;s good quality, and the plates don&#x27;t slide around. Easy to understand how to use, and the hole in the bottom allows for easy plate removal.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even use this, The nail plates that I ordered don&#x27;t even fit in it so I don&#x27;t really have a use for it. My fault for ordering the wrong ones though. It&#x27;s probably still a good product.</li>
    <li> Bought this with a few of the plates for nail decoration for my sister in law. She LOVES it and uses it all the time.</li>
    <li> Bought the whole Konad nail stamping kit.  It works does what it says it&#x27;s to do,  bought for the girls for Christmas no complaints.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I though it would be great to have something to hold the discs as you swipe off the excess polish, but the circle implanted in the holder is to shallow and uneven causing just a great big mess and uneven swipes. I wasted my money on this.</li>
    <li> not much else to say except it does what it should do which is hold a nail art disc into place for easier use. would recommend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-jill</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t really use this because its an extra step but it is handy if you&#x27;re stamping on a slippery surface</li>
    <li> As promised!  Got this to go with the Nail Art Stamp kit to hold the discs and thought it was a geat idea.</li>
    <li> Not the best plate holder for stamping plates they slide off and don&#x27;t stay put so you have to hold the plate there , only benifits is you don&#x27;t make a mess on your table</li>
    <li> Did not use it to use myself.  Ordered for grand daughter and she&#x27;s happy with it so that&#x27;s what counts.</li>
    <li> Plate Holder works well with all the discs we have. It really does make it a little easier for the kids.  Konad has not let me down with any of their products.</li>
    <li> i tried others but konad kit is best for nails art ... this holder is stable and hold the image disc firmly ....</li>
    <li> I use this most of the time I use my plates. I fits circle plates with are all I have, for now. more of a cool accessory but not a necessary to buy. but if you think you will user it I suggest you get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Its holds your plates in place.&lt;br /&gt;A sturdy base to work off from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It has light scratch from the scraper and nail polish found its way in, and doesn&#x27;t come out.&lt;br /&gt;Light color gets dirtier faster.&lt;br /&gt;Not really needed for the whole nail stamping experience.</li>
    <li> I JUST BOUGHT THIS ITEM I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN I GOT IT ALONG WITH THE SPECIL NAIL POLISH AND IMAGE PLATES. I USED IT RIGHT WHEN I GOT IT . IT COMES OF SO CLEAN AND MAKES MY NAILS LOOK LIKE I WENT TO A HIGH QUALITY NAIL SALON. I LOVE IT SOO MUCH&lt;3</li>
    <li> The price it was good ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok okok okok  ok ok</li>
    <li> This is just the thing that I needed when I ordered it and now I have it and it is still just the thing that I needed Wow!</li>
    <li> I also have the salon express set. The salon express set&#x27;s image plate holder was way more flexible and easy to use. This Konad one was hard. Like as if you were scraping the polish too hard, you could break it</li>
    <li> I tried to work with the plates without the holder but it seems like polish got all over everything.  This helps keeps things cleaner.</li>
    <li> This holds the stamps in well and does what it should do.I have no complaints about this product.It was a good buy</li>
    <li> It does the job. All it does is hold your plates in place so it&#x27;s not much of a disappointment. It goes to a cheap set of nail design tools.</li>
    <li> This is hard to use on yourself.  I bought this for my daughter.  She does not seem to use it much.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s stupposed to.  cleans easily with non-acetone remover.  I&#x27;ve used this for over a year and I still think it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, this is useless... I put the plate but it doesn&#x27;t really work for holding a plate in place since the holder itself keeps moving all over the place...</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t even need this at all for these stamps. They were ungainly enough without adding another piece of &amp;#34;hardware&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I chose three stars for this item . It is sturdy and gets the job done. However, the pink color stains and looks cheap like it&#x27;s your daughters Barbie accessories! Needs a professional look.</li>
    <li> disk does not stay in place when using.  I find using a paperplate under the disc is easier than trying to use this. quality is ok for price.</li>
    <li> holds the plate steady.</li>
    <li> This arrived earlier than expected and is exactly the same thing you would see in the beauty supply store, just a whole lot less.</li>
    <li> No, this isn&#x27;t necessary but it helped me keep my mess to a minimum. When I first ordered all my Konad stuff, I skipped the plate holder. I used the stamping kit for a long time before I decided to dish out the extra $3.50 for this when I ordered more image plates and polish. Since I&#x27;ve tried it out the first time, I haven&#x27;t stamped without it. It fits Konad plates and some of my others perfectly. Helps keep nail polish mess to a minimum and prevents counter/table top accidents. It&#x27;s inexpensive enough to try out but I think it&#x27;s just a matter of preference of the user.</li>
    <li> I bought this plate holder for my niece to use with Bundle Monster plates.  I gave it a try, but the plates really don&#x27;t seem to sit well in the holder.  I found that it is easier to simply lay the plate you are using on a napkin or paper towel.  For me, the plate holder was more of a hassle since it is just one more thing to clean the excess nail polish off of.</li>
    <li> The image plate holder came quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave it as a gift to my niece, along with the Konad Professional B Stamping set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She likes it.</li>
    <li> What you see is what you get! Great plate holder and exactly as described and pictured. No complaints here. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I recently bought the Konad nail stamping kit and thought I needed the image plate holder. Nope! All you have to do is keep the plate steady with your hand while you scrape excess nail polish off with the other hand. I should have gone with the advice from other Amazon buyers, who said this image plate holder was not necessary.</li>
    <li> This item came very quickly. I have had no problems with it. Nothing was damaged and it still works. I am happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I love this product but I really didnt use this as much as i should have because I always forgot I had it.</li>
    <li> I like this plate holder it works well when scraping the extra polish from the image plate. Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> A good addition to my nail kit.</li>
    <li> Very Disappointed!!!&lt;br /&gt;1.The holder is made out of HARD plastic,causing it to slide around.&lt;br /&gt;2 The recess is too shallow so that the plate slides off.&lt;br /&gt;3. The lip inhibits you from lifting a clean design unless you rotate the actual plate.&lt;br /&gt;4. the plate holder is to long and bulky.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work.  Complicated to follow instructions.</li>
    <li> Love stamping with this  product.</li>
    <li> I bought the stamping kit and didn&#x27;t even see this little gem. I love it and it holds the plates and works great</li>
    <li> This is a handy tool, although not really necessary for stamping. The light pink color makes it more difficult to clean. Sometimes the plates pop out too.</li>
    <li> Once you get use to it, it becomes easier. At first it was a bit difficult. It is an awesome tool to have for Stamping nails.</li>
    <li> Use this all the time.</li>
    <li> Despite what the Konad website will tell you, this is not a necessary piece of the stamping puzzle. If I place the stamping plate on a paper towel, that is enough to prevent it from shifting around.</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think I would need this.  I found out that it was extremely helpful. It holds onto the disk and makes it easy to scrape off the excess polish.&lt;br /&gt;You can use the stampking kit without it but for the price it is worth not having the hassle.</li>
    <li> I love this product as well as the plates and stamper! It is so fun, and easy, and I honestly always get compliments on &amp;#34;How did you do your nails!?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> FAIL.. it doesn&#x27;t hold the plate at all. The indents are way too small.. UGH...</li>
    <li> Loving it!!! Thanks &#x3D;) easy to use and hold the image plates very well!&lt;br /&gt; Fast shipping with good value product! Will return to buy &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, you can hold the Plate with your hand.</li>
    <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t get this item really. It gets really messy after stamping on  all 10 fingers and paints get between the plate and plate holder eventually. I must say you really really don&#x27;t need this thing at all. It doesn&#x27;t even hold the image plate steady, instead it comes off with the slightest force, I guess its just not deep enough. If you started off without it like I did and thought about getting it, I assure you you will be totally fine without it and much less frustrated since expectations won&#x27;t be betrayed.</li>
    <li> It was great. it held the image plate holders and i had no trouble and it held them down well.</li>
</ol>
