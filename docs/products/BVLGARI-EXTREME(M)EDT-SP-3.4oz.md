      <li>This is a great spring, summer, and fall fragrance; but it is different than the original, but for amazons price, it&#x27;s a great fragrance.  </li>

      <li>and than fast shipping godd product best price thanks to amazon....</li>

      <li>Very mild odor and does not stay even for 5 mins.</li>
      <li>Strong tea note encompasses this scent from beginning to end.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;Compared to the original Bvlgari Pour Homme (which is quite good as well), Extreme is more noticable and has more longevity and projection.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Very mild odor and does not stay even for 5 mins.</li>
    <li> Great Scent. My Wife loves it.</li>
    <li> this is one of the best scents that I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;thank you amazon.com</li>
    <li> Extreme is nice cologne.  However, I prefer the original Bvlgari.  Please don&#x27;t get me wrong, I have used Extreme for quite some time, but it&#x27;s not one of my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; fragrances.  This purchase from Amazon was the first problem we experienced, BUT it was resolved with one telephone call.  Allow me to elaborate...  The product that I received smelled nothing like what I was accustomed to &amp; the bottom label was absent, so I called Amazon.  The customer service representative immediately addressed my concerns &amp; resolved the issue.  Even though this problem was caused by a vendor, Amazon stepped up &amp; shouldered the burden.  Amazon stands by its customers &amp; stands behind its guarantees!  The reason that I took the time to explain this is because I have read a lot of the editorializing by whiners &amp; complainers, who claim that they were \\&quot;cheated\\&quot; or \\&quot;tricked\\&quot; with sub-standard or not authentic products.  My point is: If you encounter a problem, pick up the phone &amp; call the customer service department...  If you have a genuine problem, you know how to conduct yourself &amp; you have a little patience, you will find a very competent, friendly &amp; helpful person on the other end of the phone.  He or she will be more than willing to address your concerns in a very timely manner.  In my experience, Amazon customer service representatives do a great job!!  Moreover, Amazon&#x27;s policies are fair &amp; reasonable.  Thanks to Amazon for making shopping simple!!</li>
    <li> Great packaging to avoid breakage. And GREAT price. Thanks.</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;Extreme\\&quot; is the stronger version of the so called Bvlgari \\&quot;pour homme\\&quot; (Same packing &amp; bottle style). I must have finished at least 3 100ml bottles in the past 10 years of this perfume and I am currently on this \\&quot;Extreme\\&quot; version. Love the little musky and organic smell of this perfume. Highly recommend it for lovers of milder perfumes.</li>
    <li> I am not writing this because I personally love this scent.&lt;br /&gt;I like it, as it has a fresh and unique scent and it does last long.&lt;br /&gt;I really prefer Acqua di Gio, Givenchy Pour Homme (which to me are the 2 BEST in the world), I even liked Aqva by Bvlgari over Extrême. But then I started getting compliments from A LOT (and I mean REALLY A LOT) of women when I wear this.&lt;br /&gt;So trust me, you can go for this and see how much heads you will turn.</li>
    <li> I got it because I like the aqua line, and I must say I&#x27;m happily impressed!</li>
    <li> I first smelled this cologne at an airport in Italy.  I purchased it there and brought it home for a gift for my boyfriend.  It is amazing.  He works in sales and people would constantly compliment him on how great it smelled!</li>
    <li> I like the regular Bulgari for men but this thing is way too powdery and way overpriced.  Azzaro Chrome and Nautica Voyage are both better and cost less</li>
    <li> Not Good As Shows,Its Like a Water,Smell Not Staying Even One Minuets.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite and in my opinion, the best men scent in the world. My wife loves it too.</li>
    <li> I usually stick to a couple of my preferred colognes (Hugo Boss, RL). This time around i thought of trying Extreme. Not sure if the cologne by itself is meant to be \\&quot;fragrance myopia\\&quot; (i just made up the term) or the one i got was diluted and spirited down. I literally have to shower it upon to get the effect, for say 10 minutes... Just for records, i suffer from a scaled down compulsive disorder for cleanliness... so i&#x27;m pretty hygienic, otherwise my review might be interpreted as \\&quot;body odour overwhelming the cologne fragrance\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one fades rapidly. It sure does smell nice for the duration it stays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d stick to my preferred choices.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I found it to be the same as the one I bought at Macy&#x27;s, and the price was half that of Macy&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Good smelling cologne.</li>
    <li> Totally dissatisfied... Knock off..</li>
    <li> ý saw tis perfume in sephora manhattan and then decided to buy it to my father. ý think it is the best gift for a man. and than fast shipping godd product best price thanks to amazon....</li>
    <li> My father got me this cologne in 2007, since then it&#x27;s my favorite. I&#x27;ve been buying new bottles whenever my old ones finish. However, I always buy from retail stores. This time I decided to give Amazon a shoot. What a surprise! I tried to wear it today and literally, its smell was totally different! I know exactly how it smells as it is my favorite for 4 years.. I can&#x27;t believe Amazon can sell something fake, and I am not suggesting it is fake, maybe it&#x27;s expired. When I received it it was great but over time its smell faded and changed! However, I think I will never buy colognes online again. I&#x27;ll pay double the price and get what a pay for... Instead of paying half the price for a weird smell!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband and he loves the smell so much we ordered the after shave as well.</li>
    <li> This is just right.  Not too strong but just enough to have the hint of a scent. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this perfume and so do I. It&#x27;s a classic scent for men.  Sophisticated yet not too musky like a lot of other men&#x27;s fragrances.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing smelling cologne.. my gf loves it as well and is all over me when I wear it..definitely can&#x27;t beat the price either for the large size of a100$ bottle off cologne..under 40 bucks..!</li>
    <li> GREAT SERVICE &amp; GREAT PRODUCT, THANKS</li>
    <li> I was so looking forward to this fragrance. I decided to purchase from Amazon. The product arrived on time, the bottle and packaging looked authentic and was sealed. Upon opening the product, I was thrown off when I checked the seal at the bottom of the bottle that some details on the seal were cut off in a rectangular manner. This finding left me feeling I might have received non authentic product, because why should someone go to the length of removing part of the details that trace and identify the product. So disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Another outdated scent, but better than the original. Another donated bottle of trial an error</li>
    <li> Great price from seller. Gift for my father in law.  His favorite cologne.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was well pack so that it didn&#x27;t break&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will order this product again once I finish what I have.</li>
    <li> It very good fragrance original of my favorite</li>
    <li> i love this perfume!! and the best part.. my girlfriend even  more!! can be use at day and/or night time ^.^</li>
    <li> I like your service i&#x27;ll buy again with you</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I would have named this pour homme extreme, I would have given it it&#x27;s own name and marketed it separately.  This is a great spring, summer, and fall fragrance; but it is different than the original, but for amazons price, it&#x27;s a great fragrance.  This fragrance can be worn by the young and old, in any kind of warmish weather.  There is nothing  offensive about it, though, you wont stand out.  It&#x27;s a great safe scent.</li>
    <li> A great spray and at a most affordable price.</li>
    <li> ORDERED 2 OF THEM. BOTH ARE FAKE AND SMELL LIKE RUBBING ALCOHOL!&lt;br /&gt;AND NOW THE&#x27;RE SAYING I CANT EVEN RETURN IT!!!</li>
    <li> As described... a replacement for the one fully used bottle... quick shipping. Thank you</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my dad.  He has been longing to have it.  He is a perfume-loving man and he was happy upon receiving it.  He even gave praises to Amazon due to their promptness and sincerity to their words and actions. Wherein, it arrived two days ahead of the expected date.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne so much that as soon as it reach half of bottle I am going to order another.</li>
    <li> Omg the women at work love the scent and it last all day into the next very very pleased will order again</li>
    <li> My favorite out of all of the Pour Homme line from bvlgari.  Much stronger then the original and soir.  Great projection and longevity.  Strong tea note encompasses this scent from beginning to end.  I use this as a suit and tie or formal event wear.  Well blended and not synthetic smelling, gets lots of compliments due to the large projection.  Easy on the trigger though, it can get cloying.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. I can&#x27;t believe it was released almost 20 years ago. It&#x27;s fresh and exquisite and it stands the test of time. The price is really good too.</li>
    <li> Good but not as good as the one I have</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product and delivery.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE AND PRODUCT</li>
    <li> i love this fragrance and have been using 8 bottles over 5 years. I ordered this since it&#x27;s significantly cheaper than those at airport duty free shops. however when it arrives most of the fragrance has disappeared and all left is a faint chemical pomelo peel smell. very disappointed with the order.</li>
    <li> This stinks I ordered the wrong fragrance.</li>
    <li> It seems it is the original, however the fragrance will vanish after a couple of hours,  not sure if this is the way it is or this happens because is a fake product, great smel tough</li>
    <li> Good price on a known product.</li>
    <li> My secret weapon. Drives women nuts. Put on lightly for maximum impact.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Bulgari Extreme for almost 12 years now. It has easily been on of my favorite fragrances. I&#x27;d like to describe Extreme as that hidden choice when most guys tend to opt for the more commercially-advertised, mainstream fragrances. It is subtle, yet sexy. It&#x27;s manly and of earthy-notes but still smooth and attractive. It conveys confidence and sophistication, yet modern sensibility. I find it suitable for morning and afternoon wear.</li>
    <li> Around $88 in department stores.... great value on amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Smells so so so good....</li>
    <li> I like it. But the fragrance is not so stable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years because the scent is outstanding and long-lasting.  People compliment me and ask me what it is simply because it smells so good.</li>
    <li> Why does the bottle look different than the advertisement? The one sold just says \\&quot;extreme\\&quot; and has a very simple look. The one in the ad shows a nicer bottle with a spray top and it has the full name of the fragrance. Do I smell a rat?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this fragrance on occasions. I tried a few fragrances that I smelled. But,  I kept thinkng about Bulgari. That&#x27;s when I thought about the discounts at Amazon. Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> Como de costumbre muy buen olor, dulce, citrico tipo toronja, suave y de larga duracion, recomendado para los que gustan de olores suaves con la caracteristica calidad de Bvlgary.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s for a gift for a friend of mine. I love the smell and cannot go wrong with it. Love it!</li>
    <li> Product arrived as specified, well pack and on time. These was for a present to my best friend who love it and only uses this colon else</li>
    <li> This one I received had the correct fragrance I was used to for about 1 week.  Then, aftershave-like fragrance remained.  I trashed it while it was still 80% full.  I can&#x27;t believe Amazon still carries this supplier.</li>
    <li> Excellent smell! All the girls love it. I have been loyally wearing it for 7 years and I still keep on getting compliments from women until now. It;s really a classic, manly, woodsy scent.</li>
    <li> I receive many compliments when wearing this scent.... it is the only one I use now. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my products and the delivre is the best</li>
    <li> great service and product</li>
    <li> By far one the best--and perhaps underrated--colognes of all time! Well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> when i got this one the bottle already broken. no good</li>
    <li> It turned out to be fake! I was suspicious and went to Macy&#x27;s Store to compare with original Bvlgari pour homme extreme. Completely different!!</li>
    <li> Loved it when I bought it some years ago and been buying it ever since. Love it! I also love the regular Bulgari but prefer the Bulgari extreme.</li>
    <li> Smells very nice. Not too strong or harsh like some other mens colognes. My husband enjoys it and uses it often when we go out.</li>
    <li> I expect a great product and I receive a great product.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a little sweet smell to man, it is for you.&lt;br /&gt;My wife likes so much.</li>
    <li> The smells of BULGARI is amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tester that I tried at the store lasted longer than the one that I bought from Amazon.  However, I believe ALL of perfume testers at the stores are concentrated bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other thing I can do is purchase a new bottle from the store and compare it with the Amazon bottle to see if the Amazon bottle is watered down/fake or not</li>
    <li> this cologne is very dear to me like for real..its very good plus it never wear offf never..its a very good cologne to have</li>
    <li> I read some of the previous reviews &amp; how some go into such great detail outlining all the different parts that make the sum total of the particular smell. Wish I had that talent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first sprayed it on it was very strong (not in a negative way) and I also notice a low keyed citrus smell. After about 10 minutes I begin to notice the other smells from this spray...very nice.  As I wrote initially I cannot put into words that would describe all the subtle and stronger components that make the sum total, but the end result is a wonderful fragrance.  I will definitely buy more when this runs out.</li>
    <li> Amazing scent, I found out about this cologne on accident when my mother was wearing it and asked me &amp;#34;Wow check out this perfume! Doesn&#x27;t it smell great?&amp;#34; I replied, &amp;#34;Yes, what brand is it?&amp;#34; she showed me the bottle and it was Bulgari Extreme. We both mentioned that it smells like a guy or girl could use it so I tried some on. We started hiding the bottle from each other because we like it so much and did not want to share haha. I did not notice the pour homme at the time, it smells refined and complex. It was not until later I re-read the bottle and noticed it said pour homme. To her embarrassment, I showed her and we couldn&#x27;t believe how attractive it smelled and I decided that I should keep the little left since it is officially a cologne haha. I ran out quickly from daily use and have not used it in years as it is pricey at the mall. Lo and behold I find it at Amazon for less than half the price, of course I picked it up regardless of the reviews. I am wearing it now and the scent stays on my polo shirts the next day and some. It stays on me all day. Box was sealed and has what appears to be a serial number. Seems legit to me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real thing! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This account is under my wife&#x27;s name, but I am a 29-year old man. Thought I should clear that up in case that causes any confusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be clear, Bvlgari Extrême is my favorite fragrance I&#x27;ve ever worn. Its spicy-woody notes are unique and masculine, and don&#x27;t give off the type of Old Spice/Drakkar Noir stink that became en vogue in the last few decades. It&#x27;s sophisticated and subtle, and I pray they never discontinue it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is the second time I&#x27;ve had this happen when purchasing from Amazon. The bottle and packaging appear to be authentic, but as others have noted in the reviews, the scent in the bottle is assuredly *NOT Bvlgari Extrême*. I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent exclusively for over a decade and only the two bottles I&#x27;ve ever purchased from Amazon have this sort of after-shavey, strongly acidic, dad&#x27;s-cologne smell to them. Be forewarned: you will not get the fragrance you paid for if you buy this product. Other websites will sell testers and overstock at this price, but will not ship a counterfeit bottle to you. I&#x27;d highly recommend looking elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only upside is that Amazon will not allow you to return the cologne, as it is apparently a hazardous material [but it was okay when they shipped it to my house? Is TSA running the returns dept?] I say it&#x27;s an upside because they will refund your money, but let you keep the (not-at-all-authentic) bottle of cologne anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: Bvlgari Extrême is the only cologne I will wear. It&#x27;s masculine; subtle, not cloying. No chance of it being mistaken for AXE body stink. This is NOT Bvlgari, do not purchase it.</li>
    <li> I had purchased one of this a long time ago and i ran out so i went looking for it, but it was a bit difficult to find it on the stores so i decided to buy it online, the delivery was ultra fast and it smells just as good as i remember it, i would recommend it to anyone who likes great smooth scents!</li>
    <li> Excelent service and excelent product! I love to buy with this provider. They always be kind and do good follow up to me</li>
    <li> Love this !!! He was very surprised !!! And smells great !!! A great price and an excellent product !!!</li>
    <li> Smells awesome &amp; the ladies love it also.&lt;br /&gt;Said I needed more words to finish this review and why is that?</li>
    <li> This is clean and sexy. I love the woodsy notes that come through and make my man smell so clean and masculine.  I highly recommend this for men who want to attract the attention of women.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product, it feels like 60% of water and 35% of alcohol, 5% of real cologne.I barely can smell it.  Bvlgari Extreme means extremely weak in this case.  And I have been a bvlgari user for the past 10 years.  Trust me, stay away from this one.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t expect anything less...Amazon delivered.</li>
    <li> love the smell and so do my friends everyone is asking where i got it from love it love it</li>
    <li> good stuff well packaged did not take long worth it</li>
    <li> Like a knucklehead I gave this away some time ago, what a mistake but glad I came to my senses and re-purchased! Could be a signature scent.</li>
    <li> The best perfume i have ever had!</li>
    <li> GREAT Perfume Always !!!</li>
    <li> love this Eau the toillet</li>
    <li> Arrived swiftly, and I now smell like a million bucks! Awesome cologne! My wife loves the way I smell thanks in part to this product!!! I give it all marks...</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd time I have purchased this product &amp; I am very satisfied with it. It lasts long &amp; has a great fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love fragrances nowadays and own various bottles, and my collection is always growing. However, Bvlgari Extreme will always hold a special place in my nose (and in my girlfriend&#x27;s heart). This was the first cologne I ever bought a bottle of, and after running out of my 1.7oz bottle I bought a 3.4oz here on Amazon (great deal!) I will never be without this smell; it has become a signature scent for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bvlgari Extreme is a classy and top quality fragrance for men. It is not aquatic or gourmand, so don&#x27;t expect to smell like the ocean or like Acqua di Gio or like an ice cream sundae. I&#x27;m not saying those smells are bad, but Bvlgari Extreme is perfect for someone who wants to smell unique and dignified, with a more natural smell. You will not smell like the other guys, but you WILL smell like a MAN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extreme is rather complex and probably requires at least a few full wearings before it is understood. This is a green smell, very fresh in the opening with bitter citrus notes that last quite a while. The heart of the fragrance reveals Bvlgari&#x27;s signature darjeeling tea note, which can also be smelled in the orignal Bvlgari Pour Homme as well as the Soir version. Extreme has excellent longevity (8+ hours no problem!) with good but not intrusive projection. The basenotes of woods and oakmoss linger for a long time, never relinquishing the character of the midnotes (the citrus and tea never quite leave), and as they become closer to the skin, create a beautifully sexy skin scent that lingers on clothes, too. Even at the end of a long day wearing Extreme, my girlfriend can&#x27;t get enough of the way I smell. Two thumbs up!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the original Bvlgari Pour Homme (which is quite good as well), Extreme is more noticable and has more longevity and projection. The tea note is the same, but Extreme is quite a different cologne! To summarize:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXTREME:&lt;br /&gt;-Green and vibrant&lt;br /&gt;-Wet (projects like a beast when you work up a sweat, throwing off grapefruit and tea goodness)&lt;br /&gt;-Long lasting and potent&lt;br /&gt;-Noticable&lt;br /&gt;-Envigorating tea&lt;br /&gt;-Great for spring weather and the great-outdoors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original PH:&lt;br /&gt;-Dry and less fresh&lt;br /&gt;-Subtle and less noticeable&lt;br /&gt;-Peppery and anaemic&lt;br /&gt;-Calming tea&lt;br /&gt;-Best indoors and for work situations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the negative comments I see are about authenticity. I was worried about getting a counterfeit product, so I recommend using Fragrancenet as the seller. They have a great track record and sure enough I received the real deal.rowing off grapefruit and tea goodness)&lt;br /&gt;-Long lasting and potent&lt;br /&gt;-Noticable&lt;br /&gt;-Envigorating tea&lt;br /&gt;-Great for spring weather and the great-outdoors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original PH:&lt;br /&gt;-Dry and less fresh&lt;br /&gt;-Subtle and less noticeable&lt;br /&gt;-Peppery and anaemic&lt;br /&gt;-Calming tea&lt;br /&gt;-Best indoors and for work situations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the negative comments I see are about authenticity.

    <li> Personally not what I expected when I read about this product. Definitely should have sampled it first. My mistake. The smell does last all day, so do not over use this one people. It is more perfumy than manly.</li>
    <li> excellent purchase, the product arrived on time, which is such as described, I highly recommend</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this cologne, and I got the Extreme version because this does not last longer than 10 minutes. If you get this product, consider aslo getting a Travalo travel cologne sprayer</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent of all time. The woodsy notes make me smell manly and very masculine and with this, a little goes a long way. 3 sprays can last up to more than 24 hours, in my experience. All the girls love it too so I don;t see any reason why I should change my signature scent. LOL</li>
    <li> Smells great, just like the product in the store, but less expensive. Thw bottle came in original packaging and was not open.</li>
