    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a few days and I think I notice a difference!&lt;br /&gt;I also got the night cream and the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I noticed a reduction in redness of pimples in one week. I have acne prone skin and have not noticed any breakouts after using this for a month. It even takes of make-up! I use a quarter size and massage it on my face, then mix with water to remove makeup. After that I use about a dime size in my palm and work up a small later (this lathers a little bit, but not a lot) and then wash off any residue. I even used a cleansing water after to double check if all my makeup was off and it was! Including eye make-up! Note: I do not not use heavy eye makeup or waterproof type makeup.</li>
    <li> Obviously, products like these work for some people, and not for others. In my case it not only reduces redness with zero irritation, but when I use it consistently it seems to reduce the number of flare-ups I have.  I&#x27;ve had this problem for close to 20 years, and started using Eucerin Redness Relief products a couple of years ago.  First product that&#x27;s had any real effect.  I gave it to a friend with rosacea who also finds it very helpful.  By the way, it&#x27;s super concentrated and a tube goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is only thing with water I use any more to clean my face. It only take a very little  gel to wash my face.</li>
    <li> I have such combinatiion skin, dry in some areas, red in others and break outs in others.  This product smooths my skin in all areas and does NOT make me break out worse.  I like it quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I have a mild case of rosacea and this cleanser really helps calm it down.  I use it twice a day and I&#x27;ve seen marked improvement.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and find that if used every day it really works. I also use the daily perfecting lotion with like results.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and thought this would really work after researching it.  I was very disappointed when my skin started to sting when I used it the first time and caused a bad flare up and peeling for days.  I&#x27;ll stick with Clinique redness solutions.  It&#x27;s a lot more expensive but I have no problems with it.</li>
    <li> Very happy that I can order this via Amazon.com, because its hard to find in stores. Works very soothing on irritated skin.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from Rosacea into my 20s and can&#x27;t afford the expensive treatments from dermatologists, this works just as well if not better !</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing. I have rosacea and the redness was cut more than in half after I started using this cleanser. Also, it seemed to even out the redness, and left my rosacea less patchy. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This product is very soothing and reduces redness within days of beginning usage.  And it takes just a tiny bit for each cleansing.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial cleanser for sensitive skin - gentle enough to remove eye makeup but doesn&#x27;t cause burning sensation like other doctor prescribed medications</li>
    <li> Eucerin is an excellent product..simple as that and I own a variety ..</li>
    <li> Goes on thick and I don&#x27;t feel like I can wash it all off without cleaning deep.</li>
    <li> I guess its working, not very quickly.</li>
    <li> my dermatologist recommends this stuff.  it&#x27;s super gentle doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out.  I love it</li>
    <li> I am returning for my second purchase of this product.  I am a senior citizen (67) with very fair skin and I looked all over for a product for a bit of roseacea that appears on my cheeks under my eyes.  A friend recommended AguaPour which is a Eucerin product, and it worked quite well, but it&#x27;s like Vaseline, so I use that when I&#x27;m not going out anywhere.  Then I found the Redness Relief line.  Works very well under make-up, and it cleared up the roseacea.  Not completely, but you can hardly see it (only I know it&#x27;s there).  I plan to continue using it - especially now that winter is coming.  I&#x27;m hoping it will hold the roseacea in check.during the winter.</li>
    <li> I would not have bought three of this product of Eucerin Redness Relief Soothing Facial Cleanser --  if it didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> My skin was less red almost immediately after use. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> This has been one of the best products I have tried to calm redness down ....my face just loves it!</li>
    <li> This is a good cream, have been using it for a while now, my dermatologist recommended, like it very much.</li>
    <li> I keep ordering this because it is a good cleanser.  My recent order was shipped promptly without any problems.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> The only reason I rated it a 3 is because it did not help my particular redness in the face due to rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;My face is super sensitive but I had to try it.</li>
