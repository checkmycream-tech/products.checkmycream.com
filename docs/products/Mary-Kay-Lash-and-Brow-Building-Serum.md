### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>After cataract surgery I used the post operative drops and grew wonderful lashes.  </li>
      <li>This product is awesome, have been using it for a month but noticed improvement within 2 weeks.  </li>
      <li>Great job Mary Kay!</li>
      <li>I have had great results with this product!</li>
      <li>when i got it, it is everything the ad said it was and more!!</li>
      <li>I read a lot of good reviews and this product was affordable, so I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
      <li>Good news all around</li>
      <li>Good product - like MK</li>
      <li>this product looked good on the web page</li>
      <li>price was good, but does not grow brows.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for eyebrow but not for eyelashes.</li>
      <li>I got good results using this product on my brows, but it did nothing for my eyelashes.  </li>
      <li>and I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my lashes length or thickness.</li>
      <li>So glad I got this.</li>
      <li>I used it mostly on my eyebrows since they have always grown in space.  </li>
      <li>I do feel this is working and more than exceeds my expectations.</li>
      <li>I have never been a fan of Mary Kay products but am I glad I decided to try this one.  </li>
      <li>For me, the product works better than anything else, and I will continue using it.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with both the results this product gives and the reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the mascara is preventing penetration into my lashes as quickly as my brows.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, dries fast, and seems to be effective.  </li>
      <li>The most immediate results were right away, and then after a couple of weeks.  </li>
      <li>My brows have filled in, although I don&#x27;t think they will ever become as full as when I was in my 20s and 30s.  </li>
      <li>I have not seen a significant difference.</li>
      <li>The price is good if it actually worked.</li>
      <li>it works far better than i thought it would.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with my results so far.</li>
      <li>This product sells for $38 on sale through a consultant so to find it as Amazon price was exciting for me as I had wanted to try one of the lash builders but was intimidated by price and warnings of turning your iris color.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of bummed but not surprised.</li>
      <li>i am very please with my purchase and will buy again!</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
      <li>might keep using it to see if I&#x27;ll get results, but I don&#x27;t really think the eyebrow pimples are worth it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I was expecting my lashes to respond just as fast</li>
      <li>but it really works, and,</li>
      <li>My eyes itched so much.</li>
      <li>It seems like if too much is used, it will glob.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really like applying it to my eyelashes, so</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t say much as to eyebrow growth, it may have been helping it may not have been.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, I am 63 and was 16 when the dot to pencil thin brows were in, having kept that pattern for years, my brows never regrew and I am so pleased that MaryKay provided a product that is safe and affordable</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I know llashes take a while to grow, yet I am surprised how much thicker and longer my lashes are after 2 months of use.</li>
      <li>and my eyes look like I have light liner due to my eyelashes having grown in within 6 weeks.</li>
      <li>I have noticed some new growth in my thinning eyebrows.</li>
      <li>So far I have not had any issues with the Mary Kay Lash &amp; Brow Building Serum.  </li>
      <li>And since you are using it near your eyes, care is needed not to get it in or closer to your eye than it needs to be.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed significantly that when I am using this regularly little to no eyelashes and eyebrow hairs</li>
      <li>I had over-plucked my eyebrows when I was younger, but I have tried to be more cautious for the past 25 years.  </li>
      <li>I only got 2 mo worth of use out of it, and it doesn&#x27;t perform any better or any worse than any other product I&#x27;ve used since 2009</li>
      <li>Some nights, I apply it right over my eye makeup when I&#x27;m too lazy to take it off.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard others rate the product highly so perhaps the results are not consistent.  </li>
      <li>, no matter how thin an amount i tried to apply it turned into this glue-like consistency and started peeling off of my skin, and since my eyebrows fall out fairly easily</li>
      <li>I have very few lashes on my right side and it has really grown them over the last few months.  </li>

<li> been using for over a month now and not really seeing anything.  </li>
<li> I used this product every night for about three months and saw no real changes.  </li>
<li> (mobilized Army Reservist deployed to Iraq - who cares how glamorous I look?), and they grew back very slightly.  </li>
<li> I wasn&#x27;t diligent about everyday application, so perhaps thats why it lasted so long.</li>
<li> not sure if it is actually Mary Kay product</li>
<li> I had used one other \\&quot;pricier\\&quot; lash building product which made my lashes grow longer, but then they would start to break off or fall out.  </li>
<li> I have intraocular implants due to cataracts</li>
<li> Just use with caution, and maybe a little bit at a time until you get use to it.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this diligently for a little over a month</li>
<li> i lost a few in the process, so it was counterproductive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It was a waste of money.</li>
<li> I would not purchase this again since I feel as if I wasted my money.</li>
<li> I tried it for few weeks in my eyelashes</li>
<li> Happier, I can now use very little brow liner as my eyebrows have grown in</li>
<li> There is a small amount of delicacy needed to use this product.  </li>
<li> For me, this product is unbelievable.  </li>
<li> Can usually get 4 mo of usage out of a lash product of this size and that&#x27;s using it twice a day as recommended.</li>
<li> but it is not super dramatic, but I believe it is working.</li>
<li> Disappointed but at least it seems to work for lashes.</li>
<li> This is saving my eyebrows from a bad thread.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I read a lot of good reviews and this product was affordable, so I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt. I used on my eyebrows, as directed. I found no difference or improvement. It did nothing. Disappointed but at least it seems to work for lashes.</li>
    <li> I use it on both my brows and lashes. I noticed an immediate difference in my brows and my mother even commented on their fullness. I was expecting my lashes to respond just as fast but it did take about 3.5 weeks to notice a difference. Some nights, I apply it right over my eye makeup when I&#x27;m too lazy to take it off. I&#x27;m sure the mascara is preventing penetration into my lashes as quickly as my brows. My lashes are thicker in appearance but not longer as of yet. I&#x27;m pleased with my results so far.</li>
    <li> So..so.. product. . It&#x27;s good for eyebrow but not for eyelashes. When I apply it to my eyelash before i go to bed, my eyes itches and irritated the next morning. I tried it for few weeks in my eyelashes and I finally gave up.  My eyes itched so much. But I still use it for my eyebrows. I have not seen a significant difference. Oh well..</li>
    <li> I have noticed some new growth in my thinning eyebrows. I do feel this is working and more than exceeds my expectations.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, dries fast, and seems to be effective.  I only use it on my thinning brows and over the course of one month, some hair has regrown in overplucked areas.  I plan on continuing to use it to fill out my brows.</li>
    <li> I know llashes take a while to grow, yet I am surprised how much thicker and longer my lashes are after 2 months of use. The bottle lasted for 4 months! I wasn&#x27;t diligent about everyday application, so perhaps thats why it lasted so long.</li>
    <li> This is saving my eyebrows from a bad thread.</li>
    <li> Can usually get 4 mo of usage out of a lash product of this size and that&#x27;s using it twice a day as recommended. But not this product. I only got 2 mo worth of use out of it, and it doesn&#x27;t perform any better or any worse than any other product I&#x27;ve used since 2009</li>
    <li> The product works well but it DOES NOT come with 2 like it says in the description.  It only comes with one!</li>
    <li> I did not see any difference while using this product I used it all.  I guess I should have ordered two.</li>
    <li> price was good, but does not grow brows. It did seem to keep me from losing anymore though. I wanted it to work, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> been using for over a month now and not really seeing anything.  not sure if it is actually Mary Kay product</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!  I have very few lashes on my right side and it has really grown them over the last few months.  You have to use it every night but it really works, and, you can&#x27;t beat the price!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I am not particularly enamored with this  as I see absolutely no difference at all in either lashes or brows.  I would not purchase this again since I feel as if I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions and didn&#x27;t see a difference. It was a waste of money. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this diligently for a little over a month and I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my lashes length or thickness. I&#x27;m kind of bummed but not surprised. I will continue to use this product until it runs out and then I will start using a homemade castor/coconut/vitamin e oil concoction that I found on Youtube.</li>
    <li> Just what wife was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a month now and notice a big difference in my lashes. They appear to be longer and fuller.</li>
    <li> After cataract surgery I used the post operative drops and grew wonderful lashes.  Lutesse is not that desireable and most expensive.  I discovered Mary Kay serum an trust the company.  Good news all around</li>
    <li> I like the product and the price but still waiting to see a difference. I do see some eyebrows growing in but it is not super dramatic, but I believe it is working.</li>
    <li> This product sells for $38 on sale through a consultant so to find it as Amazon price was exciting for me as I had wanted to try one of the lash builders but was intimidated by price and warnings of turning your iris color. Not seeing that warning in the MK product I purchased it and as advertised, there may occasionally be just a slight tingle, the same I get sometimes from mascara as I have  had extreme dry eyes for years due to mascara irritation.  In fact, my dry eyes have improved since using this product as I can actually go without mascara now and my eyes look like I have light liner due to my eyelashes having grown in within 6 weeks. Happier, I can now use very little brow liner as my eyebrows have grown in, I am 63 and was 16 when the dot to pencil thin brows were in, having kept that pattern for years, my brows never regrew and I am so pleased that MaryKay provided a product that is safe and affordable</li>
    <li> I used this product every night for about three months and saw no real changes.  The price is good if it actually worked.</li>
    <li> this product looked good on the web page so i gave it a try. when i got it, it is everything the ad said it was and more!! it works far better than i thought it would. i am very please with my purchase and will buy again! so people give this a try you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> I got good results using this product on my brows, but it did nothing for my eyelashes.  Still looking for a product that does both.</li>
    <li> Used all the serum hoping to see growth and it just never happened. I&#x27;ve heard others rate the product highly so perhaps the results are not consistent.  Which is a bummer.</li>
    <li> I have had great results with this product! I had used one other \\&quot;pricier\\&quot; lash building product which made my lashes grow longer, but then they would start to break off or fall out.  So far I have not had any issues with the Mary Kay Lash &amp; Brow Building Serum.  In fact, not only have they grown longer but they have gotten thicker as well.  I am very pleased with both the results this product gives and the reasonable price.  Great job Mary Kay!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, have been using it for a month but noticed improvement within 2 weeks.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I can notice that my lashes are longer and fuller since I&#x27;m using this product. I definitely recommended, but just for night time use.</li>
    <li> i choose this rating because there seems to ne not enough serum inside tube.  I only had it for almost two weeks and its gone already, I only use it at night time as directed on tune. Will not recommend. Also havent seen any changes in brows.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 2 weeks so I can&#x27;t say much as to eyebrow growth, it may have been helping it may not have been.&lt;br /&gt;However that doesn&#x27;t even matter anymore because it&#x27;s been giving me breakouts on my eyebrows, which is disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;Also, no matter how thin an amount i tried to apply it turned into this glue-like consistency and started peeling off of my skin, and since my eyebrows fall out fairly easily i lost a few in the process, so it was counterproductive.&lt;br /&gt;I might keep using it to see if I&#x27;ll get results, but I don&#x27;t really think the eyebrow pimples are worth it.</li>
    <li> I had over-plucked my eyebrows when I was younger, but I have tried to be more cautious for the past 25 years.  Two years ago, I did not pluck them for over a year (mobilized Army Reservist deployed to Iraq - who cares how glamorous I look?), and they grew back very slightly.  After I returned, I tried another eyebrow serum, which didn&#x27;t work.  I have been using Mary Kay Lash &amp; Brow building Serum sporadically for 10 months, and I noticed a difference almost immediately.  My brows have filled in, although I don&#x27;t think they will ever become as full as when I was in my 20s and 30s.  For me, the product works better than anything else, and I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> I have never been a fan of Mary Kay products but am I glad I decided to try this one.  I lost my eyebrows due to an allergy several years ago.  I was even thinking about having my eyebrows tattooed since eyebrows do frame the face.  For me, this product is unbelievable.  I&#x27;ve been using it about a month, and my eyebrows are actually growing back. Never in my dreams did I think this product would work but, it does. I know it says you can also use it for lashes but, I&#x27;m going to draw the line there.  I have intraocular implants due to cataracts so I am scared to try it for my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Good product - like MK</li>
    <li> This product does what it claims.  I used it mostly on my eyebrows since they have always grown in space.  The most immediate results were right away, and then after a couple of weeks.  I didn&#x27;t really like applying it to my eyelashes, so I only did that every once in a while.  There is a small amount of delicacy needed to use this product.  It seems like if too much is used, it will glob.  And since you are using it near your eyes, care is needed not to get it in or closer to your eye than it needs to be.  It did cause minor acne on my brow, and the fumes from the product minorly stung my eyes.  Overall though, this product does what it claims.  Just use with caution, and maybe a little bit at a time until you get use to it.</li>
    <li> So glad I got this. I use it every evening during my skin care routine after applying eye cream. I&#x27;ve noticed significantly that when I am using this regularly little to no eyelashes and eyebrow hairs come/fall out when removing eye makeup!</li>
