    <li> Holds hair VERY well but causes hair to be extremely dry to the point you think its going to snap off, but then again it does say extra strong hold so I can&#x27;t knock pantene for that. Be sure not to apply too much, when I applied too much product it became a complete mess and caused my entire head to feel very stick. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this to get the look you are after.</li>

    <li> Awesome product! One of my daily items that are a must!</li>
    <li> Recently started using mousse with my new hairstyle and this is my favorite of the FOUR I&#x27;ve tried! It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy, just adds volume and keeps it in place.</li>
