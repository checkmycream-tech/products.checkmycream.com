      <li>I love it.  </li>

      <li>On top of that, no scalp itch with this one, as I cannot use hair products that contain alcohol.  </li>
      <li>love</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Bed Head by Tigi is so easy to use...</li>
      <li>I have wavy/curly hair that easily can get frizzy with weather</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t recall if it&#x27;s specifically supposed to do this, but it seems to protect my hair from daily heat styling, which is a great plus to have that in one product</li>
      <li>I use it with another product to smooth out my texture.</li>
      <li>but it is worth it!</li>
      <li>Overall good, can hold curves for one day.</li>
      <li>love the product helps hold shape for straight hair</li>
      <li>I have wavey hair and it may do a better job on straight hair.</li>
      <li>I wanted something easy to apply with out a lot of fuss (check), pleasant fragrance (check), and worked well without weighing hair down or making it sticky throughout the day (check).  </li>
      <li>I have serious Shirley Temple hair and this stuff is some of the best I have tried...especially for the price.</li>
      <li>Really this is a great product and wish it was sold locally, I searched for it everywhere.</li>
      <li>This makes my hair feel very soft and smooth!</li>
      <li>Love this product for my naturally curly hair!</li>
      <li>The Product is great however a little pricey at $20 a bottle....</li>
      <li>This is the best volumizer I have found for my thin, sometimes tends to get oily hair.  </li>
      <li>And  as with daily use of any styling product, I would highly recommend a good detoxifying shampoo to get rid of and prevent build-up.</li>
      <li>Small talk works great to give my hair volume.</li>
      <li>(so my hair doesn&#x27;t clump up so much during the day), and provides a bit of volume to my straight, fine hair.</li>
      <li>I returned it, hoping it would be better packaged the next time since that was the reason for the return.  </li>
      <li>he has short hair that he spikes up.. smells ok too</li>
      <li>WILL DEFINITELY GET MORE OF IT.</li>
      <li>My hair is real fine and this helps add texture without weighing it down.</li>
      <li>It does not shine as much, and has a good firm hold.  </li>
      <li>With most products, I have to use a lot to get the desired results or have to use multiple products to get my hair to behave like I want it to (and I really don&#x27;t like having lots of product in my hair).  </li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for LESS than I had ever paid.</li>
      <li>It can either be blown out for a nice finish without frizz, or if you let your hair dry naturally, it will give it a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look.</li>
      <li>Its a must for my fine, short, pixi type style....</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s really saying something.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend giving it a try!</li>
      <li>Currently, I have an above the shoulder haircut and this product works great to give the lift and body that I want without making my hair feel gross by the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this styler for 2 years straight</li>
      <li>it really helps to add bounce if you do not have the time to put into your hair.</li>
      <li>I really like this product and the price.  </li>
      <li>thanks in advance.</li>
      <li>Love this product - a little goes a long way - but provides some holding power to my fine hair!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>This product puts a little body into my hair and holds for most of the day.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to style normally because it was so limp.  </li>
      <li>the only stuff I use - have always had fine hair that nothing could help, but with this I actually have body and can style it!</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m always trying something new</li>
      <li>couldn&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
      <li>I have the world&#x27;s most unruly, thick, straight hair.</li>
      <li>First off, I have tried countless products on my fine and slightly wavy hair.  </li>
      <li>However, the first time it arrived both bottles had leaked product over the bottles as well as the two books packaged in the same order.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love Tigi Small Talk.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i order this product often and this time it had not exploded in the box!</li>
    <li> Love it! Best product to add volume and control to my naturally curly (unruly) hair!</li>
    <li> My hair is thin and fine and this left my hair limp and lifeless.  I wasn&#x27;t able to style normally because it was so limp.  I typically use Power Trip and CatWalk Curl Booster but after the rave reviews on this product I decided to try it....I am not a fan but I do love most Bed Head Products.  This one just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and find that it really gives my fine, thin hair substantial body.It&#x27;s so convenient to order from Amazon as it&#x27;s not the easiest product to find.</li>
    <li> I found the product did a fairly good job of giving my hair valume, but not as good as most of the reviews said. I have wavey hair and it may do a better job on straight hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for curly or wavy hair. it really helps to add bounce if you do not have the time to put into your hair. I use mine with a diffuser as well. It can be rather sticky and get those white hard balls at the end of the pump so be careful not too get those in your hair.</li>
    <li> Have tried lots of products....this one continues to be the favorite.  Smell is great.  I put two squirts into hand, add a few drops of water and work through wet hair.  Scrunch a bunch and air dry.  Price break when signing up for \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> bought for my bf.. he loves it wont use anything else.. he has short hair that he spikes up.. smells ok too</li>
    <li> I planned a trip to the United States in advance, bought products on the Amazon site, choose gifts for my son, as well as products of interest to me, but to close the purchase, the site informed me that the address was inconsistent and suggested changing it.&lt;br /&gt;I accepted the suggestion, and with it, the few products that I bought and I got it was because I spent almost the entire trip trying to track my orders, and going to the FedEx office to pick my products. I honestly think almost lost this trip, not counting the time to request a refund.</li>
    <li> Overall good, can hold curves for one day. Smell is good too.</li>
    <li> I wish people would use the PRODUCT customer review just for the product and not add problems they had with the SELLER(s). Really this is a great product and wish it was sold locally, I searched for it everywhere. My hairdresser used it on my hair last week, with a little argon oil which I use regularly and without blow drying, my EXTREMELY curly hair looked and felt great. I could never get my curls manageable and they always ended up tangled after a while but this kept them in check and healthy looking. Love it have to have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a place to rate your bad seller and/or package experience, keep it there and rate PRODUCTS appropriately</li>
    <li> works really good.  Was recommended to me by my hair dresser.  I wanted to quit getting perms in my hair, but have no body.  Small talk works great to give my hair volume.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter at Christmas, but I only received one in the box.  The description says \\&quot;Pack of 2\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I really like this product and the price.  I spent double for it from my stylist.  However, the first time it arrived both bottles had leaked product over the bottles as well as the two books packaged in the same order.  I returned it, hoping it would be better packaged the next time since that was the reason for the return.  Second time, both bottles were still leaking and product was all over the box.  It was a big mess both times.</li>
    <li> This is a good alternative to hair gel.  It does not shine as much, and has a good firm hold.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product but packaging seems to continue to be a problem.  At least 3 of the bottles I ordered had leaked.</li>
    <li> Good price, arrived quickly</li>
    <li> First off, I have tried countless products on my fine and slightly wavy hair.  With most products, I have to use a lot to get the desired results or have to use multiple products to get my hair to behave like I want it to (and I really don&#x27;t like having lots of product in my hair).  With this, I really only need a nickel sized amount for my whole head.  I wanted something easy to apply with out a lot of fuss (check), pleasant fragrance (check), and worked well without weighing hair down or making it sticky throughout the day (check).  Currently, I have an above the shoulder haircut and this product works great to give the lift and body that I want without making my hair feel gross by the end of the day.  I had tried this product from a friend before buying, so I knew the pack of 2 would be a good value for me.  I don&#x27;t recall if it&#x27;s specifically supposed to do this, but it seems to protect my hair from daily heat styling, which is a great plus to have that in one product and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month.  As someone who is constantly looking for a good deal of bang for my buck, this is a great product for me!  And  as with daily use of any styling product, I would highly recommend a good detoxifying shampoo to get rid of and prevent build-up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this styler for 2 years straight and I love it. Not too sticky and definitely not too thin. Recommended for anyone else who has thin hair.</li>
    <li> love this product for my curly hair!</li>
    <li> This makes my hair feel very soft and smooth! I will order this again! My hair feels like it is a lot more healthy when I use this product. My hair is real fine and this helps add texture without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Tigi Small Talk.  It&#x27;s too bad there are rumors of it being discontinued, which is why I bought the two-pack.  This is the best volumizer I have found for my thin, sometimes tends to get oily hair.  The volume lasts all day and it does not make my hair weighed down, oily or limp.  On top of that, no scalp itch with this one, as I cannot use hair products that contain alcohol.  Overall, a winner. Tigi, please do not discontinue this product!</li>
    <li> love the smell&lt;br /&gt;love how this makes my hair feel&lt;br /&gt;packaged and shippment great&lt;br /&gt;awesome stuff great price  thumbs up</li>
    <li> I have mid back length thick hair with curls and this is my go to (couple years now) since my other product I used was discontinued.  I also tried  BedHead Foxy Curls.  Not the same as this.  Thin hair as well as thick hair can be flat on the top.  What this allows me to do is air dry my curls then shake (finger comb) the crown to add a little volume without poofing out my entire head.  After that I use a few sprays of paul mitchell freeze and shine and voila!  Done.  PS it smells like a delicious fruit salad.&lt;br /&gt;Buying more today.</li>
    <li> I have the world&#x27;s most unruly, thick, straight hair. This product puts a little body into my hair and holds for most of the day. It is the best one I have found yet.</li>
    <li> My wife just loves the results, for her naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product - a little goes a long way - but provides some holding power to my fine hair!</li>
    <li> This product gives my hair more body.  I like it!</li>
    <li> Tigi Bed Head works great! I have very thin and fine hair. Tigi gives my hair body and a fuller look.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;m a product junkie so I&#x27;m always trying something new but this is my must have. I use this everyday to add manageability and texture to my fine hair. I highly recommend giving it a try!</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and hate using gel on its own.  I use \\&quot;Small Talk\\&quot; every day.  I mix a little gel in with the \\&quot;Small Talk\\&quot; in my palm and distribute through out my hair.  Small Talk helps give my curls definition without becoming crunchy (when you use gel alone).  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for five or six years.  Usually buy 2 bottles at a time even though it lasts&lt;br /&gt;a long time....I just don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
    <li> Loved getting 2 for what I could pay for one at a salon! Great product to define curly hair.</li>
    <li> I use this daily...works great.</li>
    <li> It works on my fine limp hair to give it volume and lift as well as shine. I don&#x27;t want to use anything else. I have been using it for over a year.</li>
    <li> YOU WILL LOVE THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;ONE OF THE BEST OF ITS TYPE OF SKIN CARE.&lt;br /&gt;I  WILL DEFINITELY GET MORE OF IT.</li>
    <li> I like this product.. Yes it is a bit more expensive compared to the other  brands but it is worth it!</li>
    <li> Used this for years, great product still.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this product two years ago after my hair started back after chemo.  I recently discovered it on Amazon and have been purchasing it from here ever since.  Its a must for my fine, short, pixi type style....couldn&#x27;t live without it.  It gives my hair the illusion of volume and style.  Good product, good price.  Bed Head by Tigi is so easy to use...I just rub a dab between my palms after washing my hair, and massage it into my hair, style and leave it to air dry.  Its great!</li>
    <li> the only stuff I use - have always had fine hair that nothing could help, but with this I actually have body and can style it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have thick hair already but I love it. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and I only need a tiny bit. Think dime size amount, so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This stuff is perfect for super fine hair.  I love it.  There is absolutely no build up and it washes out with your shampoo..</li>
    <li> I purchase this pack of 2 Small Talks as it is way cheaper than buying at the salon.  This is a great lightwight styler for fine hair.  I use it every day.</li>
    <li> I use this product after washing or wetting my hair.  It can either be blown out for a nice finish without frizz, or if you let your hair dry naturally, it will give it a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> I used the small talk daily . the smell is wonderful makes me happy all the time and its the best cream i used ever</li>
    <li> As advertised, I bougth a pack of two small talk, but I got only one. I did not receive the pack of two as announced. Please contact me to solve this problem! thanks in advance.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for a friend.  It came in sturdy packaging.  Once opened the contents were found to be in great shape.  Would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I started using Bed Head Small Talk about 6 years ago and bought it from my stylist. When I moved to Florida, I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I tried several other products but nothing gave my hair the volume and lift as Small Talk. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for LESS than I had ever paid. If your hair is flat and lifeless, give this one a try.</li>
    <li> Have been using the product for years. I highly recommend it. I have wavy/curly hair that easily can get frizzy with weather I use it with another product to smooth out my texture. TIGI is a great company.</li>
    <li> great product.  have used it for years!</li>
    <li> Love this product for my naturally curly hair!</li>
    <li> This is advertised as a Pack of 2 and I only got one bottle.  The Product is great however a little pricey at $20 a bottle....</li>
    <li> works well, pretty expensive, but a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Very good, I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great setting cream. Leaves hair soft yet manageable.  Hair never feels &amp;#34;gunky.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love it, always buy two at a time it&#x27;s cheaper than the salon.  I give one to my daughter and she loves it too.</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  I love it.  My hair thickens and gets good volume.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with a Bed Head product.</li>
    <li> At one of my last haircuts, the hairdresser used this product on my hair, but they didn&#x27;t have any at the salon. I&#x27;ve been borrowing my daughter&#x27;s bottle for the last few months, and then finally bought some here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smooths and separates (so my hair doesn&#x27;t clump up so much during the day), and provides a bit of volume to my straight, fine hair. I put it on before blow-drying. It&#x27;s my favorite hair product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years! It breathes life into your hair without making it greasy or gunky- the days that I don&#x27;t use it I really see a difference- flat, dull hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> love the product helps hold shape for straight hair</li>
    <li> I continue to come back to this because it gives my hair some body and also makes it easier to comb out the tangles in my thin hair.</li>
    <li> I have serious Shirley Temple hair and this stuff is some of the best I have tried...especially for the price. I go organic on almost all things, but for this stuff I make an exception... that&#x27;s really saying something.</li>
