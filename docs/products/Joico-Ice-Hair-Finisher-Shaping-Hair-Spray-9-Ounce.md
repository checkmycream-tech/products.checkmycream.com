    <li> This hair spray will keep your hair in place. Just a little too stiff.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item thru amazon ai received sit quickly and so easy to purchase not like hunting from store to store&lt;br /&gt;And never finding it</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray I have ever used.  It holds great and the best part is that it is not sticky. After spraying it is possible to continue to style your hair. Be care to look for the can that states the \\&quot;hold control #\\&quot;.  I have found that the one that is best is \\&quot;hold control #2\\&quot;.  This is the only one I use.</li>
