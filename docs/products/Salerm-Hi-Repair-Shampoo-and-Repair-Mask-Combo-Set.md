    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months now. It was suggested to me by a girl who has the most beautiful hair and so long! I asked her what she used and she told me SALERM. It was kind of spendy, but seeing as how I only wash my hair twice a week, I decided to go for it. So glad I did. I can tell a total difference in the health of my hair and how well it holds curl. I have long hair (down my back) and it is thick. I use a good amount of shampoo, at least the size of a silver dollar and start at the roots. It doesn&#x27;t get too sudsy, which I actually like. For the conditioner I also use a scoopful and leave it in for 5 min before rinsing. I am very happy I purchased this and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> The conditioner leaves my hair very soft, the shampoo dries my scalp too much. But I used it anyway.</li>
    <li> Great product but shampoo top arrived broken 😞</li>
    <li> Excellent, repaired my hair instantly, will keep buying it, very very happy!</li>
    <li> Best product ever I love the way it work on my hair leaving it nice &amp; smooth ..worth the price</li>
    <li> I love it! It lives my hair soft and bright. It also makes my hair smell very good. Although is the first time I am using this product; I will definitely continue buying more.</li>
    <li> The products are great.they helped restored my hair.my hair is more soft,looks healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> This is always been my favorite shampoo and conditioner and I keep using it.  It leaves the hair with a nice smell and shiny.</li>
    <li> I took both items to my hair dresser who use this product on her clients and also sells it.  After washing my hair with the shampoo she used the mask. She stopped and went to her mask. She started to smell and feel her mask then mines. She showed me that there&#x27;s a difference in the two. The mask at the salon had a stronger smell than this one. It is also thicker , she leaned my jar and it slide right down, but when she did it to her jar the mask didn&#x27;t move at all. She said to her there wasn&#x27;t a noticeable difference in the shampoo but the mask was way off. She caught the differences right away. This product is not the same and it&#x27;s a watered down Immitation. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I would&#x27;ve rather pay the difference and get it from the salon.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my mom after her hair was damaged while on vacation.  Her hairstylist even complemented her on a good choice of product to use.</li>
    <li> Best products ever..... You won&#x27;t be disappointed !!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing products will repair your hair for sure! I  wanted to be blond for a summer but my hair did not agree. My stylist recommended this to me, after a month all I could do was thank her!! Never used anything like it.</li>
    <li> Awesome quality, terrific smell. I can use the mask as an intense repair treatment or to slick my hair back (instead of gel or hairspray) on rainy, humid days and it works wonderfully! Gives my hair a smooth, sleek look and my hair does not move! It also works to apply it either on dry or damp hair before exposure to bleached water such as water parks and pool and great for before salt water. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Love this product  it was introduced to me by my hairdresser and I&#x27;m  hooked. It leaves your hair silky soft and very healthy and shiny after you style it and smells delish ..its worth purchasing herein Amazon the hair salon was more expensive in the price for both products..</li>
    <li> The last time a bought this product, the shampoo come with a dispenser for easier use. This time, it didn&#x27;t come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> 100% perfect repair I love it!</li>
