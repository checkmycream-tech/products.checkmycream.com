<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is an excellent product at a terrific price!! I will be a returning customer for all my hygiene needs can&#x27;t beat the prices!</li>
    <li> I bought these a couple of weeks ago and I love them. They leave my face clear of makeup (the wipes are very soft, which I appreciate), smell amazing, and leave me feeling refreshed. I like these better than the grocery store brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I gave it one star because that was the lowest offered.&lt;br /&gt;These wipes made my skin feel like I had a sunburn.  I made chamomile tea, cooled it with ice chips, soaked a wash cloth with it to help with the burning sensation.  It still itches and is quite uncomfortable after 5 hours.&lt;br /&gt;It caused lots of small bumps as well.</li>
    <li> Smells Great! Perfect for a quick way to freshen up your face or remove make up. Left my face refreshed.</li>
    <li> I really, really like these. They leave a fresh refreshing feel on my face as if I just left the spa and most importantly, they remove my make-up. I am currently wearing MAC studio fix, concealer and mascara and this pretty much gets it all off. I sometimes go over my mascara with an additional wipe but that&#x27;s just my own habit. I would definitely recommend these over Neutrogena wipes and I actually like those.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and great product. For this price, the quality is exceptional.</li>
    <li> Not Bad,  this is a nice inexpensive product I don&#x27;t think it smells bad, kind of fresh smelling the bottom is a little stand which is cute.  Took off all my makeup and eye makeup with little effort.  I would recommend it.  Shipped quick</li>
    <li> Refreshing and worked great even on my sensitive skin! Will be buying more!</li>
    <li> Great smell, would buy again just on this but the package opening is more challenging than I would have suspected and with no indication of how/where.</li>
    <li> The wipes did I what I expected them to do - removed make up and had a very clean, refreshing smell.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I was sent the incorrect item when I ordered.  I chose to keep what I received to try something new but these &#x27;Green is Good&#x27; facial cleansing wipes are the best.  I use them to remove my makeup on nights I do not want to do my full facial regimen generally because I am too tired.  I feel that these get my face clean and do not leave a residue.  I have extremely sensitive skin so I am always hesitant trying something new for fear I will break out.  These have not broken me out once.  I highly recommend for travel or nights where you are too tired.</li>
    <li> These facial wipes really work especially if you are a mature person and have a hormonal imbalance. I sometimes get acne and redness on my face - after using these wipes my face is clean and clear and you look and feel beautiful....You can confirm online but I believe Green tea is great for anti-aging, aloe firms and cucumber cools the face.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful wipes.....recommended for all persons with or without blemishes.</li>
    <li> They are soft and feel good on the face but I was dissapointed with the scent of the product ,I was hoping it would smell like cucumber but it has the smell of purfume instead which is not as enjoyable.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Light fresh fragrance. Larger cloths than most brands so they last a lot longer. Have been trying every brand and variety I can find and these are my favorite so far. Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> Just did not like.  Have been using Ponds wipes which are textured and really remove the makeup and get into your pores.  They are a heavy substantial wipe that really clean your face.  These are a smooth, wimpy cloth that did not appear to really clean my face.  I would not buy this brand again.  I did not throw them away yet but doubtful they will ever get used and will end up in the trash.  Ponds all the way for me!</li>
    <li> It has a very pleasant fragrance and cleans my face very well without feeling dry.I like it and will reorder it.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! Feels refreshing on your skin. Good alternative if your being lazy and don&#x27;t feel like washing your face at night.</li>
