      <li>I love this combination &amp; the price is great.</li>
      <li>LOVE the peppermint smell too!</li>
      <li>I was thrilled.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say I have grown more hair</li>
      <li>I love the tingling sensation on my scalp.</li>
      <li>If i run out for a period of rime it is noticeable in the ahower drain how much more hair falls out without this.</li>
      <li>The dryness on my scalp and ichyness went away on first use.</li>
      <li>Very well packaged!  </li>
      <li>I noticed it made my hair feel soft and almost 100% tangle free.  </li>
      <li>but it has really stopped the hair loss going forward.</li>
      <li>but it seems as though I&#x27;m not losing as much.</li>
      <li>I came back online and bought the smaller, cheaper kit of Nioxin Thinning Hair System Kit 4 - Noticeably Thinning Hair For Fine Hair on January 26.  </li>
      <li>Too new to comment.  </li>
      <li>Have been using consistently for the last couple of months.</li>
      <li>Very convenient price - this product was suggested to me by my Italian hair salon and it completely revitalized my hair since I&#x27;ve used it</li>
      <li>Overall, I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s re-grown my hair back to normal</li>

    <li> Very convenient price - this product was suggested to me by my Italian hair salon and it completely revitalized my hair since I&#x27;ve used it</li>
    <li> Very well packaged!  Works great</li>
    <li> The only shampoo and conditioner I use</li>
    <li> Too new to comment.  Another time.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve been using for over 10 years when I noticed thining hair.  Overall, I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s re-grown my hair back to normal but it has really stopped the hair loss going forward. If i run out for a period of rime it is noticeable in the ahower drain how much more hair falls out without this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this about 2-3 weeks ago at a hair salon which included the scalp treatment&#x3D;$106 :(.  I noticed it made my hair feel soft and almost 100% tangle free.  Bosley and keranique made my hair feel dry/coarse.  Waiting to see if it helps the receding/thinning hair at temples.  I color my hair and it is thin.  It has gotten thinner over the last 18 months.  I&#x27;ve gone thru a lot of stress over the last 2 years.  I came back online and bought the smaller, cheaper kit of Nioxin Thinning Hair System Kit 4 - Noticeably Thinning Hair For Fine Hair on January 26.  Thought I might use this one then go back to the 3.  At this point don&#x27;t have anything negative about it.  Hope it helps my thinning hair at temples.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for six months and will never return to another brand.</li>
    <li> I love this combination &amp; the price is great.</li>
    <li> Very good product at a good price, arrived on time</li>
    <li> When I discovered that I could get these hair products from Amazon at half the cost of them in the beauty salon I was thrilled. But I worried about the quality of the product - like maybe they have been diluted or tampered with. Now that I have used them I can say that I do not notice any difference in the look, feel or consistency of the products and they have cleaned and conditioned my hair just as the previous ones have so I feel that they have not been tampered with and are of the same quality as the ones you get in the salon. I am very happy with them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a little over 2 weeks and have seen improvement in my hair.  I&#x27;m losing less and new hair is growing in.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Still waiting to see results -- but hope it will be what it says it will be.  We&#x27;ll see won&#x27;t we!</li>
    <li> Using this product regularlyhelps keep my hair thicker, healthier and keeps it from falling out.</li>
    <li> Have been using consistently for the last couple of months. Definetly have seen an improvement in regards to hair loss also&lt;br /&gt;seems to cause my hair to grow faster.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin 3 for a couple years and am please with it.  I can&#x27;t say I have grown more hair but it seems as though I&#x27;m not losing as much.</li>
    <li> Excellent results. The dryness on my scalp and ichyness went away on first use. I love the tingling sensation on my scalp. I received the products in a timely manner, no complaints on my part.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever! LOVE the peppermint smell too!</li>
