<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells fresh, sexy and masculine without smelling &#x27;old.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had good luck with most of the Burberry scents -- Touch, Sport, Summer.</li>
    <li> Great cologne for working ...I lasts all day and the projection is excellent. I get so much compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband in the past and he liked it very much. So when he was running low and I saw this at a great price I ordered it his birthday.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. I love to wear it everywhere! Its so fantastic! I am so glad I purchased this!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a birthday present for my boyfriend because I love the smell sooooo much! It&#x27;s definitely different from other cologne smell that feels so masculine (so typical of men&#x27;s cologne, right?). The smell is soft and baby-like. I love smelling his shirt even more :3</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume because of the good reviews. But, the item that I get is fake, its barely have any smell and inside the bottle I can see some debris and sandy looking things, I bought it from amazon directly. So, I will recommend everyone who want to buy to ask and confirm to amazon first before ordering this perfume.</li>
    <li> I had smelt a sample at the local department stores and loved the smell.  When I ordered it through amazon it would seem very reliable and it did, it got here quickly, reasonable price BUT when I had sprayed this, it does not last!!  At first, the smell stays on for a few minutes but as time passes it on, you can hardly smell any fragrance.  The only way to smell this is grab your shirt and hold it to your nose.  The one I had smelt at my local department store was a 1oz bottle and the smell was fresh through out the day and night.  The one I have received feels like a cheap knock off or I might have been the unlucky one.  Never buying again from online and will always stick with the department store.</li>
    <li> Burberry Touch smells sooooooo good! I bought this for my boyfriend and I swear its like an instant orgasm for me lol. I refuse to let him wear this out the house without me around that&#x27;s how good it smells!</li>
    <li> After doing a lot of research on 2-3 new colognes I wanted to buy, the name Burberry was recommended to me by a friend, who said he tried it and that it drove the ladies wild. I debated between this and Burberry London and finally caved on this cent. After wearing it for just four days I can definitely say this stuff lasts ALL DAY! I do a spray on each wrist and rub on each side of my neck, and a small spray on my chest and I&#x27;m good for 8-12 hours. As far as appeal goes, I have four different women in the first day smell me and go \\&quot;What are you wearing?!\\&quot; So yeah...TOP buy guys!</li>
    <li> Scent is like art and in this case smell is in the nose of the beholder. The product description -- floral and citrus leaves with mid notes of cedar and spice, and low notes of vetiver and musk -- is pretty accurate, and I would emphasize \\&quot;cedar and spice, and musk\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t wear it every day (tacky in an office setting) but I do get some compliments when I wear it going out to dinner functions. But best of all I like the smell.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance!  My girlfriend loves it on me too!  I usually wear Hugo or Polo Sport.  I was going to buy the new Diesel fragrance but the Burberry was different and I had to have it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Pleased.</li>
    <li> Burberry Touch for men smells incredible.  It opens with strong notes of violet, then transforms into a pepper and oakmoss scent.  Then it dries down into a white musk and tonka bean heaven.  It is definitely one of Burbery&#x27;s top scents and I highly recommend it.  People will compliment you on how good you smell when you wear this.  On top of that, the bottle is very elegant with a rosewood top.  Amazon also offers this a lot cheaper than most department stores, where they usually sell it for around $67.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is very nice and I like it very much and my wife also like it.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the fragrance only last about and hour or so and no one could smell it any more. When I was in a retail fragrance store a few weeks before I ordered it thru Amazon.com I sprayed the same fragrance from their test bottle and I could smell it even the next day.  I think they maybe deluting the bottles that are not test bottles and so the fragrance does not last as long.</li>
    <li> Love Burberry, great product. Cheaper than major stores!</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne for my husband not realizing how large 3.3 ounces really was.  I think I got a great deal here on Amazon and my husband really enjoys the product.  It was shipped quickly and I received a great product.  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Every man should have this in their collection.  I doubt any will find it offensive.  Just a pleasing all-around scent.</li>
    <li> One of my friend recommended me to buy this product. And I am never disappointed with his comment.</li>
    <li> Elegant, yet not too overpowering. I think this perfume is suitable for people in age range of early 20s to early 30s... Will be weird for old guy to use this perfume. I recommend people to try it out at any perfume store first before buying it. You can&#x27;t really tell whether you like a perfume or not just based on reviews.</li>
    <li> Everything was as promised! Delivered on time, exactly what I paid for. Thank you for holding up your end of the bargain!</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I found the Burberry Touch for Men on Amazon!  All the retail stores wanted $60 and up, but I got it on here for only $35!  My BF loves this stuff so I am happy that he is happy with the gift!</li>
    <li> Just received my Burberry touch today and not only was the shipping quick but the item in great shape too. Nice work guys and it also smells terrific</li>
    <li> I hate most colognes and perfumes... they&#x27;re always too strong, or smell like something strange. I love this one, though! Ordered it for my boyfriend and it smells amazing. It&#x27;s not too heavy. Manly but delicate. Love it!</li>
    <li> The title says it all. I&#x27;ve received a good number of compliments (all from girls) about my perfume. It has a nice subtle smell that shows class and style. It&#x27;s like a good wine: not too strong, but not too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, perfumes might or might not work well with your particular chemistry. Also, I can&#x27;t see this perfume working for the \\&quot;tough guy\\&quot; stereotype. This is more of a sophisticated fragance. It goes well with men who are more into fashion. Great for the day.</li>
    <li> I do like the smell of this. It&#x27;s not as great as I remember but I still love it on my husband.Very large bottle that will take a long time to use. I got it for him a couple years ago and there is still a ton left. He pretty much uses it a few days of the week.</li>
    <li> The smell is good and lasts longer than you think, but the problem is no one will notice really since it doesn&#x27;t go further than your clothes. It does make my shirts smell great for days even after once. If you already have a women who comes up close, then it&#x27;s great but for a bachelor, you need another perfume to lure women in.</li>
    <li> This item burbury touch is my favourite. This is the only perfume  Iuse. Good price.Excellence service by Amazon.com  I will recomend Amazon.com to every one&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is the king of all website.</li>
    <li> what a great cologne by burberry. burberry touch is in a league of its own with its mellow smell that lasts and lasts and lasts, even after the gym. women constantly inquire what fragrance it is that im wearing and just leave it to their imagination. I was introduced to Touch back 2005, ran out and have not stumbled across this cologne until recently and boy have I been missing out. Treat yourself to a bottle this Christmas your significant other will thank you in more ways than one.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. The seller was good too.  Item arrived exactly as promised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 different girls tell me this smells just like a scented maxi pad.  I&#x27;m not convinced this is flattering.</li>
    <li> the item arrived really fast and exactly what i was hoping for. great scent the ladies love it. i would buy it again</li>
    <li> I find this scent to be very unique and interesting. In the bottle it smells like your average generic cologne but on the skin it&#x27;s fascinating. I can&#x27;t get enough of it. The high notes smell typical of a Burberry line. The low notes remind me of Dove soap almost? I have had a couple females tell me it&#x27;s similar to baby powder but I don&#x27;t smell that exactly. I typically need 4 squirts for it to last most of the day. I got the 3.3 oz bottle and was very surprised at how large the bottle was. It&#x27;s easily as tall as my hand.</li>
    <li> This is a quality cologne, and it seems perfect for a young professional. I use it as my default work cologne. However, at least on my dry-ish skin, the cologne wears out absurdly quickly. The top notes seem to be gone after less than a couple hours, and I doubt even the deeper notes are detectable after four or five hours. Even at the beginning, it doesn&#x27;t have much power, which is a positive quality if you&#x27;re going for subtlety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a cologne with a punch, go for something with more musk and more staying power. In the land of men&#x27;s cologne, this one is a bit of a boy.</li>
    <li> I know this product is really well-reviewed, so when I got it I was a bit surprised at the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s actually a very nice scent. It has more complexity than you might expect, and a good whiff doesn&#x27;t kill your nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also lasts a decent amount of time, and it&#x27;s definitely a scent you can wear in everyday environments, such as at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem with it is that it&#x27;s quite a flowery scent. It&#x27;s something you might smell on an older woman, like your Mom. Still a very nice smell, just not for a man in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe that&#x27;s why there are so many good reviews, is because women might like the smell of it, so the guys get good responses, and therefore write good reviews?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes my bottle was sealed and says FOR MEN on the bottle. Too bad I can&#x27;t return it, maybe I&#x27;ll give it to my Mom for Christmas.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s signature scent for many years now and always a pleasure to find our more expensive indulgences on Amazon for a better deal!! Authentic and smelled Yummy as ever!!</li>
    <li> thisis my favorite.. I check them all out in the department stores and this one has the nicest smell. it also lasts a long time</li>
    <li> I do like most of Burberry&#x27;s line of colognes but I found this one to have a sour smell to it.  I&#x27;m very surprised most people liked the cologne.  I&#x27;ve been wearing cologne for over 20 years and have had dozens of different bottles and this one was definitely up there for the worst.  I know colognes may vary from one person to the next but this one had a salty and sour fragrance to it.</li>
    <li> Burberry Touch is a great scent that women love! I know this from personal experience. Add this product to your \\&quot;sharp dressed man\\&quot; image.</li>
    <li> This is a great scent for men - clean and refreshing but not too strong</li>
    <li> This is a nice cologne. The previous reviews about the scent are correct, the most noteworthy being the fact that you should use it sparingly. After all the other scents have faded (which is within about 5 minutes of putting it on), you&#x27;re basically left with a musk - which isn&#x27;t overpowering, but definitely noticeable and lingering - and a little hint of vetiver/sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As stated in the title, this cologne seems to be suited for those in their mid 30&#x27;s and older and for more formal situations, which is the only reason I took a few stars off. I like more flexibility in a fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good cologne, though.</li>
    <li> Product wears nicely and is not overbearing, always gets positive feedback by others. Unfortunately, it wears off too quickly, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Always loved Burberry stuff and this is one of my favorite cologne. It may not last as long as some other colognes, but for me, it&#x27;s still worth the money as I only use it when I go for shorter outings.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne!  It&#x27;s my favorite and Amazon sells it for almost half price!  It was delivered quickly and in the original packaging.</li>
    <li> My husband wears Burberry Touch regularly and purchasing it on Amazon is so much easier and less expensive.  I have only had positive experiences with Amazon retailers and continue to shop Amazon with confidence and high expectations of finding quality products and prices.</li>
    <li> This is probably my favorite scent in my whole collection. I am a cologne junkie, and have really been looking for my &#x27;signature scent.&#x27; This is it; it&#x27;s very hard to explain, just buy it! It&#x27;s clean, rich, sexy, alluring and not over-powering or musky like many other mens colognes. I have used Armani Code, L&#x27;homme Yves Saint Laurent, Armani Attitude, Kenzo Toyko and I find that they just sit in the back of shelf now! I find that this is a great cologne for those in their early twenties. L&#x27;homme Yves Saint Laurent and Armani Code have that usual &#x27;musk&#x27; that is not very youthful and not what I am looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get complimented and have girls coming up to me asking what I am wearing ALL the time, nearly every time I go out, it&#x27;s a lovely experience!</li>
    <li> Not too overpowering, subtle fragrance that is long lasting describes Burberry Touch beautifully packaged in side and out and encased in a grey flannel sack--some very classy marketing overall. Touch has a mildly musky scent, so use it in small amounts.  This isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;splash on\\&quot; cologne..a little goes a long way.  If you look carefully, you can purchase this cologne for $24.95 at local TJ Maxx discount retailers.  Check it out before you spend over $30 here at Amazon.</li>
    <li> It came in a nice box, so this would make a great gift item. I have been using this product, so there where no surprises.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is very soft overall, prominent baby powder scent with overtones of lavender and other flowers. Somewhat feminine boutique (not always a bad thing...)</li>
    <li> This is a great cologne! Very light and airy, fresh and soft all in one! The shipping was fast, and over all it was a pleasant purchase!</li>
    <li> Without a doubt, this is the best smelling scent for men around.  Clean, crisp, never heavy and perfumy smelling.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a different scent other than the famous ones like Black, Armani, BLV, Hugo which I have used before. This certainly has a spicy and a masculine scent and is good for party / night wear. Used it a couple of times and already received compliments. My girlfriend loves it too :)</li>
    <li> I bought Touch by Burberry at one of the leading retail stores for $65.00.  When I got home, I decided to check Amazon to see what price they offered. I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised that they had the exact bottle for half the price.  The next time we need to purchase a product, we will check with Amazon first!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this fragrance for years and so far amazon has had the best price I&#x27;ve encountered on it. I wish I had checked a while ago rather than buying it in a retail store.</li>
    <li> I loved Burberry Touch the first time I smelt it! I was very nervous about buying it over the internet at such a discounted rate, but Amazon is awesome and I love my purchase</li>
    <li> This perfume work perfectly with my skin. I last for the entire day, and the smell is just amazing. I have various perfumes, including a few from Gergio Armani, and I still prefer this one.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best colognes I have in my collection. I purchased the Burberry Brit from Macys about a month ago and I smelled the Burberry touch before I left the store. Once I got home I was wishing I would have bought the Touch along with the Brit. The smell is just so refreshing and lasts for a very long time. Also, it does not make your eyes irritated like some other colognes. I stand by this product. Perfect for wearing in the morning, office, school, special occasions.....endless. Women of all ages seem to notice and like the smell.</li>
    <li> This is probably my favorite scent, I use it everyday and the scent smells nice without being too &amp;#34;out there&amp;#34;. It also seems to last the whole day without having to respray.</li>
    <li> Reviews on this cologne or any other is going to be kinda in the nose of the wearer. If you like a sweeter but still masculine smell that will stay long and won&#x27;t need to be reapplied all day..then this is your scent. I recommend it to anyone..but then, I like it. This is one of those things you should try out before buying blindly. But this has always seemed like a real quality product and smells great all the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been collecting/using the best of the best colognes for a while now and this is the latest to top my list of must-have colognes. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this one as it has the perfect balance between not too fruity or not too musky. The only downside to Touch (depending on how you look at it) is that it tends to be too strong, so stay on for a while, so use sparingly and maybe even spray on from a distance.</li>
    <li> I looked around at different reviews for colognes and also on the advice of the Elvis Duran in the Morning show took special interest in this scent as a valentine gift to my boyfriend.  The bottle was quite a bit bigger than I meant to buy.  The scent when first applied is cloying in my opinion and smells a bit like baby powder which is a scent I detest.  However, when this scent is given some time to mellow out it is just amazing!  It makes me want to eat him up :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne before and I still like it, and it still smells fresh, good size for the size</li>
    <li> This stuff has a strong musky smell, but my bf loves it and I like it an hour after he puts it on</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my brother and he loved it. Its has a very pleasing fragrance. I specifically love the bottle cover. I would definitely recommend this one.</li>
    <li> this cologne is by far the sexiest cologne for men. it&#x27;s very understated which makes it even more sexy. ladies.... i highly recommend this for your men.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne for my hubby for Valentine&#x27;s Day.  I didn&#x27;t want to pay the $60+ it is for this size at Sephora and most department stores.  I was so happy to find it on Amazon.com for half the price!  It arrived in perfect condition and super fast - received within 3 days of ordering with free super saver shipping! It was boxed and shrink-wrapped as if I had bought it at the store!  My hubby loves the cologne and also appreciated the $ I saved! He smells delicious!  Thanks Amazon and Burberry!</li>
    <li> Fake product. This was not burberry. It smelled kind of similar but not the same and it was in a knock off bottle with a peeling off burberry label. I purchased this as a gift so it was pretty humiliating. Amazon should not allow this charlatan to sell this product.</li>
    <li> Cologne is obviously a matter of personal taste. This particular scent I feel is very professional and not overly distasteful and overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wear it for that first date or business meeting.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my college age son as a stocking stuffer at Christmas.  He loves it and his girlfriend loves it.  I purchased a little over and ounce for him from a local department store a year ago but he ran out.  I found a big cost savings by purchasing through Amazon.  Delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> First impressions were a bit sweet for my tastes.  However, the scent does grow on you, and now I prefer this to my other choices.  Give it time to develop...there are subtle changes over the hours while wearing.  Pleasant and mature.</li>
    <li> The price on Amazon is half you would spend in any store, definitley worth the price, and it came within a few days.</li>
    <li> Very nice great smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last for almost 6-8Hrs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too strong. Great for every day use.&lt;br /&gt;I am using same bottle for more than 8 months now.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my 20 year old son, and he loved it.</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorite smells.  It actually changes throughout the day (in a good way).  But really, bottom line is said in the title of the review.</li>
    <li> good product  and have nice quatilys and i know people will like it. they should try it and see them selves</li>
    <li> The scent of Burberry Touch by Burberry for Men Eau De Toilette Spray is perfect, I love it!!! I would surely recommend this to my friends. The scent stays in me the whole day.</li>
    <li> the perfume came before i was expecting.....i just loved it!!! i am giving four star just because i ordered it with a gift gift wrap. othrwise itss just awesome :)</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping....works well, so far so good, still too new to know for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: product worked really well, no major complaints!</li>
    <li> I bought this product from macy&#x27;s for about 70 bucks because it smells great. Much cheaper on here but the smell was noticeably off a little. Wearing it everyday for a year you know what it smells like and there was definately a change in smell. Still smells good. But not AS good.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my partner for Christmas. It&#x27;s one of his favourite colognes. We both love it. It smells amazing and he&#x27;s very happy with the gift.</li>
    <li> love it, great shipping and good communication! Will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Items are 100% real. I work in retail, and it is the same bottle. Love it</li>
    <li> It is not the same like the ones I used to by at the large chain store. This does not last all day like my prior ones and does not smell the same too.I am wondering if the one I got from here is opened or dated.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this colonge also gets alot of likes from passer by&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Great price last time I bought this colonge in this size bottle for this price was at the Sams Club a few years ago when I first tried it&lt;br /&gt;Now even Sam Club wants more money than this cost for half the size bottle and that&#x27;s if they even have it&lt;br /&gt;At this price and this size this colonge only has Pro comments&lt;br /&gt;Cons  I have nothing bad to say about this one&lt;br /&gt;Most definitely would recommend to a friend</li>
    <li> BOUGHT IT FOR MY FIANCE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY AND HE LOVED IT. I LOVE THE SCENT, THE PRICE, THE QUALITY OF PRODUCT. IT ARRIVED IN A TIMELY FASHION AND I WAS PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT GOOD QUALITY ROCK BOTTOM PRICE</li>
    <li> The fragrance is exceptional. Avery time I use I got compliments and asked what cologne I use.</li>
    <li> Good price. Been looking for this stuff for a while now at a reasonable price. Cheapest I&#x27;ve found it on here.</li>
    <li> The cologne has gotten many compliments; highly recommend!  It is one of my favorites and the volume is quite nice as well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about this scent, but girls ask me all the time what it is.  If they have boyfriends, I tell them the wrong kind.</li>
    <li> I like this, this is my 3rd bottle  i dont used it all the time therefore i can still wear it whenever i want to and still  like it.....&lt;br /&gt;If the price is right why not, ......seems to be a quality product .....recommend it....</li>
    <li> After reading all the rave reviews on this site i was expecting much better. The cologne starts out with a STRONG heavy pungent powdery scent. It can really reak havoc with your nose and throat areas if you apply too much so use very sparingly. I used 3 sprays! For the first couple hours it smelled like i was breathing talcum powder which WASNT pleasant. After a couple hours it lightens and transforms into a lighter pleasant sweet floral musk smell. It actually smells like its geared more for women than men. I think overall there are much better choices out there that offer clean, fresh, crisp manly fragrances without that annoying lingering powdery scent that never really goes away with time.. UNPLEASANT! LOL.  Not sure why guys love this fragrance so much its ok/ average but i would not buy it again!.. Just seems like there is some sort of tradeoff between the nice musk aroma and the thick top heavy pasty powdery scent. Just go buy a bottle of Kenneth Cole Reaction and thank me later...</li>
    <li> I love this product very much. All of my friends love it. I highly recommend to buy this product .</li>
    <li> i had purchased this product from a Dept store so i am familiar with the scent.  I decided to get a good deal on Amazon.  The product is long lasting and seems to be the real thing.  Great price, great service, great scent.</li>
    <li> Title says it all! This is the best smell and it never gets old. Just don&#x27;t spray too much and you&#x27;ll be getting compliments all the time! Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been much of a cologne wearer until recently. This was a recommendation by a colleague. I liked the smell immediatley...subtle and masculine which is exactly my style. I was also suprised at how long it lasts. I workout during my lunch breat at work and I can still smell it after running three miles and showering (and i do not spray it on my clothing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is now my favorite fragerance.</li>
    <li> I bought my husband this - I smelled it in the store and fell in love with it. Its not a heavy cologne, crisp and light. Its the perfect cologne.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the scent of this cologne. It is definitely one of my favorite fragrances but on my skin it does not last very long. Some colognes I can get away with only 2 or 3 sprays to last the day but with this one apply 5 sprays and usually do not get a full 8 hours. That being said I do give this 4 stars because the fragrance is simply amazing. I do not have a very fine tuned sense of smell but whatever is in this I find very appealing; I just wish it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> I get a fair amount of compliments when I wear this cologne. It smells great when you put it on and lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Burberry Touch is one of my favorite fragrances.  It is traditional, but fresh!  I never tire of wearing it and highly recommend it for men of all ages.</li>
    <li> Not long lasting, but  $35 for mens cologne so you get what you pay for. Will not go with this cologne again</li>
    <li> my son had his 24th b-day this was part of his gift&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is one of the scents that he likes to use</li>
    <li> I am a very heavy colonge user. I always have more than 10 different cologne with me all the time beside my reserve ones which i keep it secretly in my closet. I love burberry and it is by far one of the best cologne i have used since i started using any kind of cologne. This is the cheapeast price you can find in amazon, for the same product outside at Macys or other big name store you will pay over sixty bucks. This is the best deal and the best product you can find period.! Loved Burberry and will buy again and again!</li>
    <li> I think this is one of my new favorite colognes.  I would give this six stars.  I think the Burberry brand is a very popular cologne for men and women.  I would buy again any day.</li>
    <li> The price is unbeatable for a product I would pay top dollar for. This is a must buy this holiday season</li>
    <li> This product smells exactlly like the one you would buy at Macy&#x27;s just cheaper!  I think this is a very good value to smell so good!</li>
    <li> It is much lighter than normal!!!! The sealing did not look like an original one too! Hope it is not fake!</li>
    <li> I put this smell good on and killt da club. Err body wanna smell me, smell my man scent, and basque in the vapors.</li>
    <li> I tried this cologne many times at department stores before purchasing. I think it&#x27;s a great scent, perfect for fall and winter. To me it&#x27;s a sophisticated scent which would work well for wearing with a suit or any other type of occasion where you&#x27;re dressed up a bit more than normal. It&#x27;s a clean, fresh scent that still has some body to it. I wouldn&#x27;t consider it a light scent, but it&#x27;s also not a heavy/strong winter type scent either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason you should definitely buy it is the price. You can&#x27;t beat it. Amazon is my go to place for buying colognes because you just can&#x27;t get it cheaper anywhere else. I would say try this at the store to see if you like it, since everyone&#x27;s smell preferences are different. If you like it, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it here.</li>
    <li> This is a great cologne and lasts forever. Sometimes a little to sweet smelling, but it mixes well with other colognes and scentes. Not too overpowering.</li>
    <li> I love it and so does my wife. Need I say more? I have used this scent before and I keep coming back to it.</li>
    <li> I happened to know about colognes a great deal,... and I have conducted a test&lt;br /&gt;on this item and it proved to be fake,.... the odor does not last long (not enough oil base), in fact it smells even different&lt;br /&gt;i bought the original one from the mall and you can&#x27;t compare both; the one from the mall has a scent that lasts much much longer and is very strong, this product has watery texture. I&#x27;m 100% convinced in my conclusion that this product is not the real Burberry made.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from Amazon.com. It arrived just on time with excellent quality. I have been using this fragrance for years and love it a lot. This purchase from Amazon.com was exactly what I expected with excellent service. Thanks a lot...</li>
    <li> I love this scent; it is so light, clean and fresh.  The person I bought it for is irresistible as it is, wearing this cologne just makes him even more appealing.</li>
    <li> This cologne is awesome... Not to strong or overwhelming, a soft, light, clean, fresh smelling cologne that is long lasting. I have been using Burberry Touch for years and I would highly recommend it for all men.</li>
    <li> great price great product i get many compliments on this cologne. if u like Dolce &amp; gabana and abercrombie Fierce youll like this</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and son. I knew my son liked the fragrance because I&#x27;d bought it for him before.&lt;br /&gt;It is not overpowering  like some men&#x27;s fragrances refreshing.  My husband liked it, too.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is awesome. It is subtle but definitely present. I gift this to all my favorite men... :)... and they love it too.</li>
    <li> I say that is not original because smell just for 1 hour ... If you want to buy a good product go to buy a departamental store</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the Burberry Touch Eau De Toilette that I had first tried at Macy&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s much cheaper here on Amazon as with all other things.  Irrespective of how much you spray it seems to last all day long.  My clothes smell of it even after being laundered, so you can imagine how potent it is.  That being said, it&#x27;s not over-powering even when you wear it.  The only thing I would find as a con for this is that I occasionally feel like it smells a little like a women&#x27;s perfume, but for most part it&#x27;s good and smells masculine.  I would definitely recommend this for everyday wear and for a long-lasting freshness all day long.</li>
    <li> not too overpowering, nothing esle to say. i don&#x27;t like having to type more than i want to, so please remove that requirement.</li>
    <li> This and aqua di gio are my two personal favorites and the two that I receive the most compliments on. It isn&#x27;t too overpowering of a smell and two sprays is enough to last the day. My female coworkers always give me good reviews when I wear it and my girlfriend loves it. This is quality cologne for a good price.</li>
    <li> This is one of my best and top colognes for me and my father. We enjoy it very much and it has a smell that prolongs nearly all day.</li>
    <li> Inspected this bottle very carefully and happy to report that it is authentic--guess it pays to order from Amazon direct.&lt;br /&gt;Touch is a good scent with light musk in the opening; floral/woody sillage.  Good for year round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased colognes from the houses of YSL, Versace, Chanel, Issey Miyake, etc. from department stores such as Saks, Neiman, Macy&#x27;s, Nordstrom since i didn&#x27;t want to take a chance on getting counterfeit.  But for my latest purchase of Dior Homme, I ordered again from Amazon direct. Keeping my fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> will recommend it for anyone who wants a great gift or for themself -&lt;br /&gt;the size and smell is great for the price</li>
    <li> Very inexpensive compared to Macys. I tested this spray in the store, liked it, and bought on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance itself is mild yet noticeable.</li>
    <li> Just do not wait..have it! I loved this.It has that fragrance which only you can experience.Every body has a different way to respond to perfumes..so choose it right!</li>
    <li> This is my fav perfume from past 10 years and I think I can go another 10 using the same one. Just love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling Burberry they have out. I just order more for my fateher I know he will like it.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to buy this perfume. But trust me it is great. My wife loves it and the female colleage asked which one is it to buy for her husband. :) It stays on till you wash the shirt. :)</li>
    <li> I was so happy when I found it on amazon for a great price. I would def buy another one when I run out again!</li>
    <li> Its different than other colognes. Someone said it before but it does indeed bring about an \\&quot;air\\&quot; of class that&#x27;s been missing in all the macho colognes and body sprays. I&#x27;ve gotten tons of female compliments since i&#x27;ve started college last year. Its been my best kept secret since i first got it as a gift from my brother.</li>
    <li> I am usually not a burberry cologne fan, but Touch is a pretty good scent. The only downside is that it can be a little over powering sometimes. Still, Touch is a good scent.</li>
    <li> This item arrived fast and as described in listing. I was amazed that I purchased this item for half the cost that I would&#x27;ve paid at Macys. This is a great price for TOP quality great mens cologne.</li>
    <li> I have worn this fragrance consistently since 2003. It is definitely my favorite scent and is subtle yet sophisticated. The bottle gives a consistent amount with each spray which is important to me as I do not want to overuse it when I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great!</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne because of the scent and how strong it is. (not at all) It will last a long time when wearing it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this order. Came quickly, and much cheaper than department stores. It was well packaged and it came like it was supposed to.</li>
    <li> This shipped promptly and packaged for safe arrival. I felt the discounting was not as competitive as comparable products but bought because I&#x27;ve used the scent and couldn&#x27;t compare others over the net.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne, its my favorite. However to me there is something different about this one then the last bottle I purchased at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have some of the one i purchased at the store that i keep in my car.  The spray is different, one is a heavy short spray this one is more so a light long spray.  The smell does not seem AS strong as my original bottle either. It makes me worry that it&#x27;s the diluted display models, but everything on the bottle, packaging etc tell me its legit. That is just my 2 cents. The women still say I smell good so I&#x27;m not too disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this fragrance several times. It has an addictive woody scent that lingers with you. People tend to come back and ask what I&#x27;m wearing, closing their eyes to take another whiff (ladies mostly) ;)</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites perfumes!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay for more than 3 hours</li>
    <li> A nice smell that Ive used for years. Im 27 and find this to be a good and balanced scent. It doesn&#x27;t linger too long but is distinct enough to be remembered by those you encounter. This isnt for the 17 year old that drenches himself in Axe or the guy who wants the entire bar to smell him when he walks in.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on lots of good reviews, and my husband couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. He said he can&#x27;t stop smelling his wrist at work.</li>
    <li> I have tried them all from Burberry and &amp;#34;Touch&amp;#34; is by far the best from their fragrance line.&lt;br /&gt;I have been told it has a hint of baby powder.</li>
    <li> For the price, I would out this up against Prada any day. Along with being a great smell, it lasts and drives the ladies nuts.</li>
    <li> This cologne is really really amazing. I was quite skeptical on spending that much money to buy a cologne online and that...too...without experiencing it how it smellss!!!Wow!!. This guy is really really Cool and it smells invigorating and pleasant. I Already got lot of compliments on its nose soothing odor(Good smell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give credit to my friend who suggested me this product and that too from amazon. I never buy cologne online as there are some sellers out there just wanted to exhaust their old inventory with a price that it don&#x27;t worth. But, this is really a great buy. will recommend to others</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he absolutely loved it! He&#x27;s obsessed with burberry touch but didn&#x27;t think I would get it because of the price but this price was amazing! Super happy with this purchase :)</li>
    <li> Friend strongly recommended this cologne so I went ahead and bought it. The price was very good and the smell is unremarkable. It&#x27;s a very clean scent and lasts all day. I have random people coming up to me and asking me what cologne I use.</li>
    <li> Best Eau De Toilette spray.  I love it.  My best Burberry scent.  It smells so good.  Light scent.  Best scent for me.</li>
    <li> My husband loves Burberry Cologne so I ordered this for Valentines Day for him.  He loves it,  the bottle is the right size too. I love it on him as well it smells great!  I definately recommend buying it for the man in your life!</li>
    <li> very nice Cologne a nice soft smell i love it.....very nice cant complain my wife love it and it has e very sexy touch love it</li>
    <li> This is truly one of the best smelling colognes out there in the market. Have received many compliments on how great I smell after using it. Sometimes when it is windy out and the wind hits me and then I smell the Burberry on me I think to myself &amp;#34;Damn I smell amazing&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great product. The smell is great and there are always compliments.  Would definitely buy again.  Arrived quick and great price.</li>
    <li> a lovely fragrance, very charming and mesmerizing, pairs well with one million  and or au de rouge (bvlgari).</li>
    <li> It smells amazing! My boyfriend loved it!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift. Received product very quickly. AMAZING price!!! Even cheaper than the online fragrance outlets (with a coupon!) Thanks again!!!</li>
    <li> Everything as hoped for. A character requirment for number of words in this field of entry is lame. Real lame.</li>
    <li> Not sure how to describe a smell....all I can say is that the women approve of it!  Wound buy again.</li>
    <li> I agree with some other reviewers.  I&#x27;m in my early 40s.  I wouldn&#x27;t have been interested in this this type of cologne.  In my 20s and throughout the 30s then till now, I&#x27;ve been a fan of fresher, light, often \\&quot;sport\\&quot; type (sometimes citrusy) smells.  The reason why I like this Burberry Touch is for the after-notes after it wears off the initial sharper impressions.  I like the musky powdery woody hints after the first 30 minutes, and it&#x27;s not overbearing at all.  I like it.  This comes from a guy who hasn&#x27;t bought this type of \\&quot;mature\\&quot; smell before.  This is the type of fragrance worn by the most interesting man in the world, not by some immature kid with an arrested development.  You may call it an evening type of perfume, as opposed to a day-time one.</li>
    <li> Fresh clean scent... Critics have mentioned that it&#x27;s too strong, so I recommend using it sparingly.  Easily my favorite cologne of all time.</li>
</ol>
