<li> I can use 100 strips for a long time.</li>
<li> I tried using these strips on my eyebrow and legs and they left behind large patches of hair.</li>
<li> Took a long time to arrive, weeks past expected date.</li>
<li> These work good with the creme wax (haven&#x27;t tried them with hard wax) but the product literally took about a month to arrive! :(</li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> However, the wax that came with the package was awful.</li>
