      <li>Really love these blades.</li>
      <li>What I am most please about is the auto shipping every the months.</li>
      <li>These blade refills are great, they fit right into my Gillette razor.</li>
      <li>The product came in on-time, the right product, and in good condition.  </li>
      <li>It is high quality product, and the price and quality ratio contained in the product is great.</li>
      <li>Have yet to see if the pro glide is better or not, but this one works fine for me</li>

      <li>Much easier than going to the store to buy them, and the price is good too.</li>
      <li>So I purchased them for a fantastic price AND they shipping very quickly.</li>
      <li>the blades have worked for me just fine, no complaints.</li>
      <li>The product is just fine, fit my fusion power handle.  </li>
      <li>Plus with prime there is free shipping...</li>
      <li>Always gives an incredibly smooth shave and wears well.</li>
      <li>Smooth and I have yet to cut myself.</li>
      <li>I received a free package of cartridges from Gillette .</li>
      <li>clearly this is a good value.</li>
      <li>After decades of having the skin on my legs chopped to smithereens by being such a skinflint, it was ONLY by default of receiving the Gillette Fusion Razor through the Vine Program that I realized just WHY people spend good money on GREAT razors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
      <li>Great deal and more economic than purchasing these razors at the local box stores.</li>
      <li>Original, As described and fulfills my requirement.</li>
      <li>so i need to clean shave and</li>
      <li>clean shave.</li>
      <li>Fusion gets you clean.</li>
      <li>Very close and safe shave.</li>
      <li>and I personally feel like those blades appear to be superior to these.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s unavailable, after being a loyal customer for years and years</li>
      <li>But no matter what, personally, I haven&#x27;t seen blades remain sharper for more than 4/5 shaves at the max or more than 3 weeks if once a week shave.</li>
      <li>Although they sound overpriced at first I have used one set of blades for two months and sometimes longer.  </li>
      <li>I have tried almost all damn razors and shaving gels in market worth trying, nothing has come close to Gillette, be it disposable ones or Mach or Fusion or Series gels, they win hands down.</li>
      <li>have used Gillette&#x27;s blades since the &amp;#34;Mach 3&amp;#34; and I have always been pretty happy with them (despite their short lifespan and high cost).</li>
      <li>Well worth every penny paid.  </li>
      <li>Get about 2 weeks of a good shave before blade dulls and reduces effectiveness of the shave.  </li>
      <li>At $4 or so each, it&#x27;s kind of pricey, but worth the cost given the solid shave you get</li>
      <li>Anyway, it is worth it.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money</li>
      <li>However, the sheer magic of how FANTASTIC these blades work and</li>
      <li>The blades got here on time but went to use one and it broke right away.</li>
      <li>I subscribe to auto delivery and save additional money right through Amazon.</li>
      <li>Came with the right count.</li>
      <li>these are fast and clean.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that other factors such as using a brush and better shaving cream impact the quality of my shave more than top of the line razors do.  </li>
      <li>is nice, but I continue to use the razor head for long after it is gone</li>
      <li>For a good and a clean shave, a blade lasts Max of not more than a month.</li>
      <li>I get really good use out of them, they last and the price is better than Target or other places</li>
      <li>Buy straight razors instead, they&#x27;re cheaper, better for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>reviewers have stated that three blade shavers offer the same advantages for a lower price, and while I cannot comment on that assertion, I can say with assurance that Fusion razors are incomparably better than any one or two blade model I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They are good razors even when the price is a little high.</li>
    <li> Good razors and love the fact that they Shipp automatically</li>
    <li> I had this item on auto-refill, and all of a sudden it&#x27;s unavailable, after being a loyal customer for years and years</li>
    <li> As a man, and having sensitive skin and a tough beard also, I suffer from the worst of both worlds!!!. Thanks to these razors, I get a close shave and my skin goes unaffected and is left smooth for the wife to touch. I only see that you can only get a few good shaves from each razor and then it is basically showing wear and not shaving close enough. While everything else in the world has cheapened up, so has the metal we use in the US. But, for the money, it is the best manual razor I feel out there. I subscribe to auto delivery and save additional money right through Amazon. These razors in a 4 pack at Walmart are $15.97 and I pay $10.38 from Amazon with auto delivery, so why not!. With these tough economical times, why not save a dollar and I wrote this to let other people know about this deal that is available. Thank You.</li>
    <li> The product is just fine, fit my fusion power handle.  When I search, this product popped out as Fusion Pro-glide, and in the link for this product, the text also suggested proglide, but the product I received is just normal fusion. On the webpage itself, the description is correct, but if not looked carefully but just believe the search result, you will think you are buying a proglide. It is confusing.</li>
    <li> I have very very sensitive skin, and try to shave only once a week if it helps. Max 3 times. I have tried almost all damn razors and shaving gels in market worth trying, nothing has come close to Gillette, be it disposable ones or Mach or Fusion or Series gels, they win hands down. But they have their limits. Some one wrote that they last longer if we dry it, rust is what blunts a blade kinda... naah not at all. Generally I hate water, be it a razor or a towel or anything else. I dry my razors using hair dryer for a minute after shave, and consequently the blades get dry too. It helps keep water of my rack too. But no matter what, personally, I haven&#x27;t seen blades remain sharper for more than 4/5 shaves at the max or more than 3 weeks if once a week shave. For a good and a clean shave, a blade lasts Max of not more than a month. No problem with it for 6 months, it will work, but would be a damn bad shaving experience. We don&#x27;t need to get a Gillette for that, any run of the mill Chinese throwaways would do.</li>
    <li> I had previously been very satisfied with this product, but my first, and only, 4-count package from Amazon had defective \\&quot;Lubrastrips\\&quot; that curled, leaving sharp edges that could cut facial skin -- and did. The strip was still mostly green, indicating that it should have been good for additional shaves. The strips on all four blades in the package curled and one fell off. Perhaps there is a manufacturing difference in the blades sold here versus in stores, or perhaps it was just a bad lot.  I would&#x27;ve given the blades I purchased in stores five stars for sharpness and longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See the user loaded photo of a blade with a curled strip (if Amazon hasn&#x27;t removed it, again).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a razor and it works. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Just as good as T thought it would be. It is a Gillette. The absolute best razor.</li>
    <li> Good subscription deal.</li>
    <li> Good price, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great deal and more economic than purchasing these razors at the local box stores.</li>
    <li> The product came in on-time, the right product, and in good condition.  It&#x27;s a nice bonus to be able to setup a subscription for this stuff. Beats sam&#x27;s club or costco.</li>
    <li> Fusion gets you clean.</li>
    <li> I was always of the belief that 37 blades is overkill!  Then I tried the Fusion blade.  The Best, most comfortable shave I have ever had.  Well worth every penny paid.  Simply the best.</li>
    <li> I tried switching to decent disposable razors as the Gillette Fushion blades are getting so much more expensive than they were when I started using them a few years back, but other blades have given me razor burn so I am back to these until I can find an alternative that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
    <li> Good razors but way over priced. I won&#x27;t buy these any more. If cost is not an issue with you then these are good razors.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if these were genuine Gillette blades or knockoffs or what, but I couldn&#x27;t get near as much longevity out of these blades as I did from the same blades bought at the local big box store.  I mean, they work, they just dulled out much faster.</li>
    <li> buying these blades on amazon is the best! i no longer have to go to depressing Rite Aid, or CVS and try to find an employee who can unlock the razor blade shelves for me. i have these on my &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Two of the blades , have already worn out, very quickly , only a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Probably the best blade going. Always gives an incredibly smooth shave and wears well.</li>
    <li> Recently learned I should change my blades after every other shave. Even though these are pricey, Amazon seems to have the best pricing.</li>
    <li> These are great razors for the everyday shaver, however they are very expensive.  I&#x27;ve found that other razors can be almost as good but for a dramatic discount.  I&#x27;ve found that other factors such as using a brush and better shaving cream impact the quality of my shave more than top of the line razors do.  After trying most razors, creams, and such out there I&#x27;ve settled on the Tweezerman&#x27;s brush (amazon, around $11), Art of shaving or Proraso (c.o. bigelow) shaving cream, and inexpensive Dorco razors.  Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I received a free package of cartridges from Gillette . the cartridges for these work really well other than they clog up easily.  At $4 or so each, it&#x27;s kind of pricey, but worth the cost given the solid shave you get</li>
    <li> Got it a day later then I should have...great product tho</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those chicks that used to buy a Bag O&#x27; Razors at the Dollar Store. The operative words are \\&quot;used to.\\&quot; After decades of having the skin on my legs chopped to smithereens by being such a skinflint, it was ONLY by default of receiving the Gillette Fusion Razor through the Vine Program that I realized just WHY people spend good money on GREAT razors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $4.10 per blade unit, in my world, this is ghastly expensive, compared to what I used to buy. However, the sheer magic of how FANTASTIC these blades work and how LONG they last, made me open up my moth-filled wallet and order the refills. The in-between times that I need to shave my legs has DOUBLED, simply because the shave from these blades is almost like a waxing job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never a knick/scape/bleeding gash on my legs any longer, I&#x27;m now a convert to the philosophy (at least with razors), that \\&quot;You Get What You Pay For!\\&quot; So long, Dollar Store disposable razors. Hello, Gillette Refills! :D</li>
    <li> Not all blades are created equal!  I&#x27;ve been using the Fusion razor for about two years now after moving from an electric shaver. Much closer shave!  I aldi like the detailing blade. What I am most please about is the auto shipping every the months. I will never have to run out to the store just to buy blades again! Plus with prime there is free shipping... I&#x27;m saving $3 on each order not including the cost of fuel and my time!</li>
    <li> fusion blades are great for the manual razor . i have never had any issues using them so far !!!</li>
    <li> I was able to shave my face multiple times with no cuts. clearly this is a good value.</li>
    <li> Best I have ever used. Well worth the money</li>
    <li> clean shave. these are fast and clean. does a great job. for me i hv inspection from the school house so i need to clean shave and these does the job but i hate how razor cost so much</li>
    <li> Anyone that can make four cartridges last three months must be shaving peach fuzz or only shaving once a week. That&#x27;s what you have to do to get by on their advertised $1 per week subscription plan. I had to triple my order (about $3 per week) to be able to shave once daily. The Fusion ProGlide does make my face feel like a babies butt for a few hours which is better than the alternative brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using gillette since the mach3. I updated for this and us really good. I used and works really well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Fusion razors for a number of years, and continue to be amazed by the virtually total lack of nicks, even with shavers that have been used for months.  There was controversy awhile back, with some Amazon customers questioning the authenticity of the Fusion packages. I find these units deliver the same repeated close shaves as those I&#x27;ve bought in the past, online, and elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have stated that three blade shavers offer the same advantages for a lower price, and while I cannot comment on that assertion, I can say with assurance that Fusion razors are incomparably better than any one or two blade model I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Buying this product on amazon saves a ton of money. I would recommend it to anyone over going to a store and buying it for at least double the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Item just as described works great and arrived quickly. I Will order again when items needed. No problems very happy.</li>
    <li> Smooth and I have yet to cut myself. It&#x27;s a men&#x27;s razor but I like it better than traditional women&#x27;s as I feel they are smoother and easier on the skin not to mention they don&#x27;t rust as fast.</li>
    <li> the blades have worked for me just fine, no complaints. Have yet to see if the pro glide is better or not, but this one works fine for me</li>
    <li> Really love these blades. They don&#x27;t make sonic booms as the Mach 3s did. Constantly cracking my neighbor&#x27;s carrier pigeon&#x27;s eggs. Also comes with a nice box you can use to re-gift stuff during the holidays. Next time I&#x27;ll subscribe to this instead of buying it one pack at a time. I&#x27;m just trying to sync up my beard growth cycle to the subscription service. I highly recommend this to anyone who is not trying to look like a Diesel model. I&#x27;ll buy this again. I have to.</li>
    <li> Came with the right count. As Sharpe as those bought in a store. Nice packaging!&lt;br /&gt;Do I think this expensive razor and cartridge is worth the extra cost. Really can&#x27;t say, its close to a no, but that would mean I made a mistake LOL. Id say it was worth it but only to fussy people.</li>
    <li> These are great razors. They always get the job done without leaving a mark. The green strip leaves behind a nice softening effect. Would recommend these to everyone! I think they are better than any women&#x27;s razor I have tried.</li>
    <li> I like this company&#x27;s product. It is high quality product, and the price and quality ratio contained in the product is great. I like it</li>
    <li> Where once was a creepy neck beard, there is nothing.</li>
    <li> These blade refills are great, they fit right into my Gillette razor. Much easier than going to the store to buy them, and the price is good too. I won&#x27;t use anything but this brand of razor either. Recommended. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The razors I received in my last order were dull!  What happened?  They shave like they have already been used....</li>
    <li> Any of these five razor blades are way too expensive and they&#x27;re basically a rip off. But however you still need to shave probably...lol</li>
    <li> The blades got here on time but went to use one and it broke right away.</li>
    <li> Sometimes it seems like a waste to be using so many blades at once, but one cartridge lasts me a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Same thing as what is in stores.</li>
    <li> Amazing as always on time and always a pleasure to deal with fast and always on time thank you for your great job</li>
    <li> Original, As described and fulfills my requirement. Thanks</li>
    <li> These blades don&#x27;t glide very smoothly.  Get about 2 weeks of a good shave before blade dulls and reduces effectiveness of the shave.  I shave after a hot shower and use Geo Trumpers shave cream applied with a brush.</li>
    <li> Good price, competively. Arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> Ordered for replacement blades and they work great.  My order was shipped quickly and in good order.  I was pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great razors for a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> better then harrys blades</li>
    <li> The packaging is way too big.  A four count of razor blades does not need a box big enough to put a large novel in.  Otherwise great way to buy blades.</li>
    <li> I love these razors they last me months. Ladies don&#x27;t be fooled by marketing and buying those dull pink razors that die after a couple shaves.</li>
    <li> This is a basic refill set and works fine.  Although they sound overpriced at first I have used one set of blades for two months and sometimes longer.  I shave every 3 days give or take.  I used to shave every day and they lasted about 30 to 40 days before they needed replacement.</li>
    <li> I actually wasn&#x27;t intending on purchasing these on Amazon originally but it came up as an option when I purchased a new razor and I said, welp I can get some points on my Amazon Card and why not? So I purchased them for a fantastic price AND they shipping very quickly. Three days? Maybe two, and I&#x27;m not even a Prime member. Great price and great quality. Exactly what you would buy from Rite Aid or another chain store for a couple bucks less. Some say Amazon is killing local businesses because of purchases like these, well they should maybe not make quite the buck on some products. I know a local business owner and the way he lives is hardly &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; so if I can save a couple bucks and get points + not even have to go to the store to pick it up, I&#x27;M IN! Will purchase again in the future!</li>
    <li> Tried one of the new cartridges and works very smooth and sharp. shaves great.</li>
    <li> This Item has the best price I could find anywhere locally in stores and online. You want to be careful buying cartridges online since sometimes they are not genuine ones. That is why I buy from amazon since I know they will last and work well. The subscribe and save is especially great. These blades last a while, but it is still nice being able to get them every few months and they are also at a 5% discount which makes the price even lower! Will continue buy these cartridges from them since great price and great shave! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Buy straight razors instead, they&#x27;re cheaper, better for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Great value and shipped quickly!</li>
    <li> These blades give me the closest shave with little or no irritation. Face feels great when done.</li>
    <li> I buy these all the time and they last for many shaves. Still more expensive than buying blades for electric shavers.</li>
    <li> much too expensive -schick better value same shave,Haven&#x27;t used it yet.Cheaper at warehouses.I&#x27;m still using Mach 3 disposabiles&lt;br /&gt;which shaves just as good.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why anybody would spend money on these overpriced razors.  I went to one of the monthly clubs and a pay a 1/3 of what Gillette wants for their razors. Plus the quality is equal and the shave better.</li>
    <li> Very close and safe shave.I still use an electric occasionally but nothing shaved closer than my 5 blade fusion.Usually after shaving with my Braun I have to do a touch up with the fusion to get that smooth feeling</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with this product but need to be better.. it&#x27;s okay for time being, not sure other people...</li>
    <li> Tried every razor and razor club. I absolutely hate admitting it, but nothing gives me a better shave than these insanely overpriced razors.</li>
    <li> These are a bit over priced from anywhere you buy them, but they work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like they do get dull quicker than they should, but the lotion strip works well enough that you can sometimes get away with a quick shave without using shaving cream (I have somewhat thin facial hair, so that may make a difference). My mustache is somewhat thick though, and I have found that one of these blades will only last about 3 or 4 shavings before it gets pretty uncomfortable to shave my mustache against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Gillette&#x27;s blades since the &amp;#34;Mach 3&amp;#34; and I have always been pretty happy with them (despite their short lifespan and high cost). I received a &amp;#34;Schick Hydro&amp;#34; razor for Christmas last year and I personally feel like those blades appear to be superior to these. I&#x27;m going to use these as a backup, but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll end up buying them again after having tried the Schick ones.</li>
    <li> Great razor at a great price.</li>
    <li> Good razors. I just wished they were cheaper.</li>
    <li> the best a man can get!</li>
    <li> First order arrived as described and waiting for other to arrive on monthly basis.  Very good razor.</li>
    <li> the refill blades are great</li>
    <li> I get really good use out of them, they last and the price is better than Target or other places I&#x27;ve seen them</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these razors for years and love them!  They give a great shave and the moisture strip on them is nice, but I continue to use the razor head for long after it is gone (I just soap up) and it still gives a great shave with no nicks.</li>
    <li> It is expensive than I thought, but it is the best Cartridges I have ever used.  Anyway, it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I would like to start of by saying, these are the best blades i have purchased. They deliver a nice clean shave with hardly any hassle. I will clearly be purchasing these again</li>
