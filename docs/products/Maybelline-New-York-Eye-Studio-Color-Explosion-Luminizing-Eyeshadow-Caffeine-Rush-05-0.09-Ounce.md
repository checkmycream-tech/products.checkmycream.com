      <li>Definitely worth buying!</li>
      <li>Not a knock off, its the real deal! :]</li>
      <li>The shades are a nice taupe shimmer with only one shade (one of the ivory shades) being more of a metallic.</li>
      <li>The shades are very neutral and easy to blend.  </li>
      <li>lovethe shimmer shadow colors..very calm but can make you eyes really pop!!</li>

      <li>No regrets and a happy future abounds, until they&#x27;re gone!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It holds up a whole day and once it lasted thorugh my gym session too!</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s pretty shimmery, which I didn&#x27;t expect, and that bothers my eyes.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this entire palette of shadows.</li>
      <li>Then I use the most sparkly part to add on just enough glamour.</li>
      <li>Maybelline New York Eye Studio Color Explosion Luminizing Eyeshadow in Caffeine Rush is a super collection of neutral brown tones that will take you from day to evening, depending on your application of the product.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty cosmetic to really bring out your eyes.</li>
      <li>I searched online and bought several of these palette combos because it is my easy morning go-to shadow.</li>
      <li>The eyeshadow stays on during my whole 12 hour shift.  </li>
      <li>Came fast and packaged well.</li>
      <li>The darker shade works very well as an eyeliner for a smokey look.</li>
      <li>The shimmer topcoat is very shimmery and it makes your eyes really stand out.</li>
      <li>Someone even ingeniously tried to make it look right by pasting the &#x27;correct&#x27; caffeine rush key on the back.  </li>
      <li>Does not have a big enough of the darker shadow part, I could use more of the darker tone.</li>
      <li>I love maybelline eye studio little palettes, couldnt find this one in stores</li>
      <li>I wish it was a little more beige-light brownish.</li>
      <li>But progress and new shelf products keep a-comin&#x27; to draw our interest and tempt us with new must-have items!  </li>
      <li>When I first put this on, my husband asked what was different because I looked extra pretty that day!</li>
      <li>This is a replacement of my old one that was used up.</li>
      <li>Have been using it nearly every day.</li>
      <li>The white one has a bit to much shimmer in it for me</li>
      <li>lighter shimmery shades go really nice and subtle during the day and the darker ones can be used for a more dramatic look at night.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The colors are soft and blend-able and really make my green eyes stand out.</li>
      <li>And he does NOT normally notice new make-up.</li>

    <li> I love maybelline eye studio little palettes, couldnt find this one in stores so i ordered it here! Definitely worth buying! Not a knock off, its the real deal! :]</li>
    <li> This brown pearl color family is perfect for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;Although she is picky to pearl color cosmetic, she loves this one.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter asks me to buy it for her.</li>
    <li> I wear this eyeshadow every day. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a nice neutral eyeshadow compact. The shades are a nice taupe shimmer with only one shade (one of the ivory shades) being more of a metallic. Very blendable, nice buildability, great staying power. The darker shade works very well as an eyeliner for a smokey look. All-in-all this is a very nice compact for a decent price.</li>
    <li> Love the colors!  The eyeshadow stays on during my whole 12 hour shift.  The colors are vibrant and I love the sparklies in it!  Got so many compliments the first day I wore it!</li>
    <li> Great color match every time so far. I use this mostly in the winter months. I bought it because I tryed out a friends and loved it</li>
    <li> These colors are even better in person than in the picture!!! (:</li>
    <li> I love this shadow. It goes on smoothly, beautiful colors, and good pigmentation. It lasts long on my lids even if i didn&#x27;t use a primer.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eyeshadow! The colors in the palette are neutral and shimmery. I have problems with eyeshadows coming off and leaving a line on my eyelid - this eyeshadow stays on for hours without any of that. I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Too sparkly...ends up on my glasses. Nice colors but I had no idea how &amp;#34;bold&amp;#34; the colors are. Just not for me.</li>
    <li> Bought it a year ago. Have been using it nearly every day. Still using it! The only downside for me is the yellow-pink color on the left of the palette. It makes your eyes look kind of inflamed since it makes it pinkish-yellow. I wish it was a little more beige-light brownish. Besides that, these shadows are wonderful.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this entire palette of shadows. But progress and new shelf products keep a-comin&#x27; to draw our interest and tempt us with new must-have items!  Hence, this cute lil girl was no longer available in stores!  In my despair (yeah I&#x27;m stretching it a bit) I searched online and bought several of these palette combos because it is my easy morning go-to shadow. In all I think I ordered 7. No regrets and a happy future abounds, until they&#x27;re gone!  I should search for more I spoze!  I am not a hoarder!</li>
    <li> Perfect, I will be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> The colors are very  nice  . The white one has a bit to much shimmer in it for me but it comes with two whites and other one does not have shimmer I  it . Great but for the small and small enough you can but in your make up bag unlike the Naked Pallets</li>
    <li> lovethe shimmer shadow colors..very calm but can make you eyes really pop!! awesome you gotta try!!!</li>
    <li> these are great colors and blend very well</li>
    <li> I had ordered Caffeine Rush 05 and instead received Pink Punch 25.  Quite a difference.  Someone even ingeniously tried to make it look right by pasting the &#x27;correct&#x27; caffeine rush key on the back.  What a misdirected waste of energy.  Could not change color Pink to Caffeine that way, sorry to say.</li>
    <li> nice color with great price</li>
    <li> since I can&#x27;t find this in stores around me anymore which makes me believe that they stopped making it. Just got online nothing was damaged and it was perfect ! it goes great for my skin tone and eye color . I LOVE IT! will buy again when mine goes out!</li>
    <li> My fav as good as the too faced natural eye but cheaper and looks nicer on and with primer it stays on for a long time</li>
    <li> I ordered this after watching a YouTube video featuring this pallette. The colors are very shimmery, which is perfect for night and special occasions. I ordered this with the intent of using it daily, but I can only use 2/5 of the colors  for my desired look.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few weeks ago and it isn&#x27;t as dramatic as I had thought it would be.  The shades are very neutral and easy to blend.  The shimmer topcoat is very shimmery and it makes your eyes really stand out.</li>
    <li> ho scelto questo ombretto per curiosità,inoltre mi fidavo della marca e quindi ho unito le due cose&lt;br /&gt;consisglio vivamente di provarlo</li>
    <li> Love the shimmering color</li>
    <li> Maybelline New York Eye Studio Color Explosion Luminizing Eyeshadow in Caffeine Rush is a super collection of neutral brown tones that will take you from day to evening, depending on your application of the product. I use this to apply a variety of brown shades to create just the look I want to bring out my eyes. Then I use the most sparkly part to add on just enough glamour. I use this with black eyeliner and a couple of layers of black mascara to make it complete! This is a pretty cosmetic to really bring out your eyes. The ivory metallic looks great right under your brows.</li>
    <li> Does not have a big enough of the darker shadow part, I could use more of the darker tone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty shimmery, which I didn&#x27;t expect, and that bothers my eyes.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement of my old one that was used up. Its my fav color palette. I use it alot and couldnt find it. Came fast and packaged well. Very happy.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeshadow! The colors are perfect and blend well together. The glitter and shimmer make it a great product for everyday wear, or going out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if Maybelline stopped manufacturing this or not, because I am unable to find it in stores anymore. As always, Amazon to he rescue!! This eyeshadow combo is the best I have ever used. Stays on, blends beautifully, and I love the gentle shimmer. It&#x27;s not over-the-top. When I first put this on, my husband asked what was different because I looked extra pretty that day! And he does NOT normally notice new make-up. This eyeshadow is a winner for sure!</li>
    <li> I liked the product. I would purchase it in the future. The eye shadow had lots of shimmer.&lt;br /&gt;and the variety of colors were nice.</li>
    <li> LOve it love it love it</li>
    <li> This is a really good day and night night eye shadow.&lt;br /&gt;The lighter shimmery shades go really nice and subtle during the day and the darker ones can be used for a more dramatic look at night.&lt;br /&gt;It holds up a whole day and once it lasted thorugh my gym session too!</li>
    <li> Love this eyeshadow. Goes on smoothly and the color is perfect. Hope they never stop making it! I love it!</li>
    <li> I think this palette is just great! I have been using it to achieve a smoky eye that isn&#x27;t as harsh looking as using black. The colors are soft and blend-able and really make my green eyes stand out.</li>
    <li> The two darker browns are just alike.</li>
    <li> I love this eye shadow. I wasn&#x27;t able to find it in the store anymore so I ordered 2. Loved the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and costs lower online.</li>
