      <li>Beautifully Detailed.</li>
      <li>so this is great in that it actually holds it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is a heavy 2 prong clip which holds my hair wonderfully.</li>
      <li>Plastic clips don&#x27;t last and don&#x27;t do a great job.</li>
      <li>It looks kinda cheap.</li>
      <li>So unique.</li>
      <li>expect a masterpiece for this price; but you will certainly get more value than what you paid for.</li>
      <li>But not bad.</li>
      <li>Very pretty.</li>
      <li>It took almost 2 months to get here, which I dislike very much, but can&#x27;t complain too much because it was cheap and free shipping.</li>
      <li>They are so pretty!</li>
      <li>Exactly as pictured!</li>
      <li>The hinge seems very sturdy &amp; the gems are securely &amp; neatly glued in place.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money and the wait.</li>
      <li>Still a beautiful hairpin and not worth returning since it didnt cost much.</li>
      <li>Larger than expected - which is great!  </li>
      <li>I truly have gotten my monies worth</li>
      <li>It takes a while to get to you, but anything you want I  life is worth waiting on.</li>
      <li>Pretty, fair hold for long hair.</li>
      <li>I got this for my wife who has very looooooooong hair, and it has no trouble holding all that hair because the structure is all metal and very strong.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s the right color description.</li>
      <li>This was cheap, and it looks perfectly decent.</li>
      <li>SO VERY MUCH.</li>
      <li>pretty.</li>
      <li>Really pretty hairpin.</li>
      <li>Color is exactly as shown on the picture.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty</li>
      <li>Pretty</li>
      <li>For less than 3 dollars its worth way more than that.</li>
      <li>It is very vintage looking circa 1920.  </li>
      <li>High quality hairpiece!</li>
      <li>The pricing is extemely reasonable.</li>
      <li>The clip is on the heavier side, so it might not be comfortable for those with thin or very fine hair.</li>
      <li>Item looks just like the pictures and has good grip, however my hair is very thick and it doesn&#x27;t hold much of it.</li>
      <li>Overall I love what it would have looked like and if the stone had been with the clip I would have put it back in and been on my way.</li>
      <li>Works great for wearing hair up, down, or half up/down.</li>
      <li>Its beautiful, but bigger than I thought and I have thin hair</li>
      <li>They gave me the option to refund me the money or send me a new one.  </li>
      <li>Love the different uses and its not too heavy.</li>
      <li>MY KIDS LIKED THEM FOR THEIR VERY LONG THICK HAIR.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t quite remember how long it took the first time, but the second time was 2 weeks shipping.</li>
      <li>This is very pretty but arrived with a stone out and the hanging part missing</li>
      <li>I am mixed, with long curly hair, therefore I&#x27;m very particular about hair accessories.</li>
      <li>I highly recommended for long hair on a bun or as a gift!!</li>
      <li>These clips are high quality, hands down.</li>

<li> Mine did vary a little from the photo.</li>
<li> Con: it&#x27;s quite heavy, so you need a lot of hair and a tight hairdo for it to stay in.</li>

    <li> When I got my order in the mail, it wasn&#x27;t the hairpin showed in the displayed image. Still a beautiful hairpin and not worth returning since it didnt cost much. This is what the hairpin I got looked like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BRW1AFO Vintage Jewelry Crystal Butterfly Hairpins]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still works nicely, would have given 5 stars if I got the correct product.</li>
    <li> Pretty but the quality is so poor it broke as soon as i touched it. Took forever to arrive. Not worth it. DOn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> These are Beautiful hair clips, they are made strong and hold well, I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...Such Beautiful colors. Every where I go strangers stop and ask me, where did you get that hair clip.</li>
    <li> No jewels have fallen out of it and it works great! It&#x27;s made out of a sturdy metal so I&#x27;m not scared of breaking it when I use it in my long hair.</li>
    <li> pretty. Arrived on time. Brighter than pictured, also a tad more greenish turquoise, it&#x27;s teal, that&#x27;s the right color description. It shows turquoise in the picture, but is definitely teal in actuality.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! it is so beautiful in person it makes my hair look amazing always get compliments</li>
    <li> This was cheap, and it looks perfectly decent. What impressed me about this item is the actual clip, which is sturdy and strong. I have thin hair, but a lot of it (long) so this is great in that it actually holds it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect a masterpiece for this price; but you will certainly get more value than what you paid for.</li>
    <li> love the way it looks on my hair specially when I pick it up..strong and well made at a great price.I highly recommended for long hair on a bun or as a gift!!</li>
    <li> Item looks just like the pictures and has good grip, however my hair is very thick and it doesn&#x27;t hold much of it.</li>
    <li> I love this hairpin. It is very sturdy and beautiful it adds a lot of style to a simple hairdo. It takes a while to get to you, but anything you want I  life is worth waiting on.</li>
    <li> l though the first hairpin I received was defected, I must admit that this is a beautiful piece. I contacted the seller &amp; explained my situation. They gave me the option to refund me the money or send me a new one.  I chosed to get another one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I did. It&#x27;s beautiful, just a great hairpin. A must have. I get alot of complements on it. Color is exactly as shown on the picture. I feel that it looks way better in person. For less than 3 dollars its worth way more than that. Don&#x27;t quite remember how long it took the first time, but the second time was 2 weeks shipping.</li>
    <li> Beautiful hair clip, the colors are amazing and it looks great. Works great for wearing hair up, down, or half up/down. Love the different uses and its not too heavy.</li>
    <li> This was more durable that I thought it would be. It&#x27;s actually metal! i love these! They are so pretty!</li>
    <li> I love this hair pin. I have a lot of hair and it actually picks all of my hair and stays in for a while.</li>
    <li> Its beautiful, but bigger than I thought and I have thin hair so it slides.  That being said, I still want the other ones</li>
    <li> My niece loved this piece.  Very pretty.</li>
    <li> Took a month to get it but BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL! I bought one in pink too. Very cool hair pieces.  Very happy</li>
    <li> purchased it for myself and some friends, who absolutely love it.  It is very vintage looking circa 1920.  great for that party</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful and for this price its a must have</li>
    <li> THESE WERE A BIG HIT AT CHRISTMAS. MY KIDS LIKED THEM FOR THEIR VERY LONG THICK HAIR. LA LA LA</li>
    <li> This one is nice as a fun/costume jewelry piece. It is a bit bigger/bulkier than Ithought, so I wouldn&#x27;t wear it day to day. But not bad.</li>
    <li> Pretty, fair hold for long hair. Little hanging piece is kind of annoying, it taps at your ear the whole time.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair clip because it looks beautiful and it was at a great price that I couldn&#x27;t beat when it arrived I tried it on and it looks beautiful in my hair I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> i bought five for my bridesmaid&#x27;s they loved them. warning they are bigger than you think but overall these are gorgeous and a affordable price!</li>
    <li> Really pretty hairpin. Mine did vary a little from the photo. (Didn&#x27;t have the hanging accents)</li>
    <li> I bought a purple version of this too. The purple one is fantastic. I wasnt impressed with the teal one though - the colors are not true to the picture and the beads don&#x27;t match on the item itself. It looks kinda cheap. Just not a fan.</li>
    <li> This clip is beautiful!  Larger than expected - which is great!  Well worth the money and the wait.</li>
    <li> This is beautiful. Can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> It took almost 2 months to get here, which I dislike very much, but can&#x27;t complain too much because it was cheap and free shipping. It&#x27;s pretty but it is way way to heavy to be a hair clip.</li>
    <li> High quality hairpiece! I got this for my wife who has very looooooooong hair, and it has no trouble holding all that hair because the structure is all metal and very strong. she loves it!</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured! The clip is on the heavier side, so it might not be comfortable for those with thin or very fine hair. The hinge seems very sturdy &amp; the gems are securely &amp; neatly glued in place. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I really love them. So unique. Beautifully Detailed. Can wear them with anything!!! THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. Hope to see more like this from you!</li>
    <li> This is very pretty but arrived with a stone out and the hanging part missing so I was a bit sad.  Overall I love what it would have looked like and if the stone had been with the clip I would have put it back in and been on my way. It is a heavy 2 prong clip which holds my hair wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I waited about a week before of use, before I gave this review. I recieved all 32 items claw clips I ordered. They were packaged with extreme care. I examined each clip and was amazed at how gorgeous they were. The photos do them absolutely no justice! I am mixed, with long curly hair, therefore I&#x27;m very particular about hair accessories. Plastic clips don&#x27;t last and don&#x27;t do a great job. I&#x27;ve been using metal hair clips for over 15 years. These clips are high quality, hands down. The pricing is extemely reasonable. I truly have gotten my monies worth and then some. I would recommend this product to anyone, before going to a mall paying the outrageous prices. If I could rate this product any higher, I would!!!</li>
    <li> And the person that I bought it for loves it and says it&#x27;s the prettiest hair clip that she&#x27;s ever had.</li>
    <li> Love this! Bought for my daughter and she loves it. Con: it&#x27;s quite heavy, so you need a lot of hair and a tight hairdo for it to stay in.</li>
    <li> Took a while to get here but she loves it</li>
    <li> Really good and cute thanks i like the design and everything thank you</li>
