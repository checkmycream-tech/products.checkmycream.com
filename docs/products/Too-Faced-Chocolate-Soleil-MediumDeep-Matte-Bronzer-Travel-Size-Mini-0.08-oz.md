      <li>I bought this with the intention of buying the full size but wanted to make sure it was the color I was looking for.</li>
      <li>a bit tan and both colors accomplish that fine.</li>

      <li>Not only does it go on easily</li>
      <li>Awesome product, long lasting but the chocolate smell is a little too much for me.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying the full size</li>

<li> it&#x27;ll last a very long time.</li>
<li> My favorite bronzer ever I&#x27;ve been using it like crazy.</li>
<li> It took a long time to find a matte bronzer</li>
<li> &amp; it&#x27;s August now and still have a long way to go.</li>
<li> The people who are complainig about size clearly dont know how to read &amp; or are crazy to think the full size would be sold for less than a 3rd of the price!?</li>
<li> And let&#x27;s face it if you have limited space you working with &amp; lots of products out</li>
<li> but it didn&#x27;t build up to be dark enough for me.</li>
<li> The plastic is really hard to open and caused the entire pan to crumble after 2 weeks of use...</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like chocolate to me; but more a weird &amp;#34;somethings off&amp;#34; smell but at least it goes away</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve ever spent my money on.</li>
<li> I have this small sample size still left over for traveling or just to keep in my purse to use as a touch up.</li>
<li> but it doesn&#x27;t immediately go on as dark as some other bronzers I&#x27;ve tried, you can build it up to whatever suits your skin tone.</li>
<li> This is a small sample, which is what I expected.</li>
<li> A little orange for my liking.</li>
<li> I felt it was extremely overpriced but the small amount of bronzer you get.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been missing out.</li>
<li> I have pale olive skin and never go in the sun.</li>
<li> I have VERY pale skin and platinum hair, but naturally dark hair</li>
<li> I will say that its a bit difficult to get your brush in on this tiny size, but it&#x27;s not a huge deal.</li>
<li> Small size</li>
<li> I like the fact that this is small and I can carry it in my make-up bag.  </li>
<li> At my age I needed a bronzer without sparkles and that is unbelievably hard to find.</li>
<li> that there are no sparkles or luminess to it along with no orangey color either that can be so common in bronzers.</li>
<li> I really like this bronzer but the packaging is terrible.</li>

    <li> BEST MATTE BRONZER EVER HAS A GRAYISH TONE TO IT THAT IS PERFECT FOR CONTOURING AND BRONZING HIGHLY RECCOMEND!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this bronzer. Before this I have always used Mac and never thought I would switch.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this is small and I can carry it in my make-up bag.  Love the color</li>
    <li> My Daughter liked it !</li>
    <li> This is a small sample, which is what I expected. It comes in a cardboard/flexible plastic case. It smells like cocoa mix, which is pretty pleasant. I have light skin and if I use a light hand it looks really great and not too dark. I like it and may consider buying the full version once I finish, but I think that will be a long time from now. I will say that its a bit difficult to get your brush in on this tiny size, but it&#x27;s not a huge deal.</li>
    <li> Good color. A little orange for my liking.</li>
    <li> Wanted to buy this smaller size instead of purchasing the larger one first. It smells really good and the quality is great!</li>
    <li> I was interested in trying some face contouring and decided to try purchasing this smaller size figuring if it didn&#x27;t work at least I wouldn&#x27;t be out all the money spent on a full size; but I was surprised at how well it works. Not only does it go on easily but it doesn&#x27;t immediately go on as dark as some other bronzers I&#x27;ve tried, you can build it up to whatever suits your skin tone. Also it has a wonderful scent and blends easily.</li>
    <li> Best bronzer I&#x27;ve ever spent my money on. Small size but don&#x27;t let it fool you- it&#x27;ll last a very long time. I purchased this in March,2015 &amp; it&#x27;s August now and still have a long way to go. It&#x27;s not shimmery at all which I love, matte wear- gives you a nice tan look.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the intention of buying the full size but wanted to make sure it was the color I was looking for. This is a nice warm brown shade, not orange. The cocoa smell is not overpowering; I don&#x27;t notice it once it&#x27;s on. I have olive skin and I think this gives me a nice sun kissed glow. I was hoping I could use it as a contour as well but it didn&#x27;t build up to be dark enough for me. I bought the full size and use it daily in place of my old bronzer. I like that I have this small sample size still left over for traveling or just to keep in my purse to use as a touch up. If you&#x27;re worried about whether $30+ is worth it, I would recommend purchasing this sample and give it a shot first. It&#x27;s also vegan and animal cruelty free :)</li>
    <li> I have pale olive skin and never go in the sun. At my age I needed a bronzer without sparkles and that is unbelievably hard to find. It took a long time to find a matte bronzer and I bought both the light bronze and darker bronze.  I saw this being used as a contouring powder on a video but I only wanted it to make my face seem a bit tan and both colors accomplish that fine. The only thing I don&#x27;&#x27;t  care for is the smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell like chocolate to me; but more a weird &amp;#34;somethings off&amp;#34; smell but at least it goes away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Happy that there are no sparkles or luminess to it along with no orangey color either that can be so common in bronzers.</li>
    <li> Loved it price was good</li>
    <li> So this stuff is awesome! I&#x27;ve been using bronzer with sparkles for years, and had not even considered it without. Whoa! I&#x27;ve been missing out. This stuff leaves such a great tone in my skin. I love it. Oh, and it smells like chocolate - so there&#x27;s that too. And while this is only a sample / travel size, there&#x27;s lots of bronzer here. I can def seeing this lasting me well over a month.</li>
    <li> I really like this bronzer but the packaging is terrible. The plastic is really hard to open and caused the entire pan to crumble after 2 weeks of use... But if you want to try this bronzer before you spend 30$+ for the full size, it&#x27;s great for that. I will definitely be buying the full size</li>
    <li> This is the perfect size and price if you are just wanting to try out the product.</li>
    <li> Love this and love the smell!! Very fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Love! I use it for contouring and not to mention it smells like actual chocolate.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the color.</li>
    <li> My favorite bronzer ever I&#x27;ve been using it like crazy. Its a must makeup item to have....</li>
    <li> Awesome product, long lasting but the chocolate smell is a little too much for me. I use it on occasion.</li>
    <li> It is a tiny sample size of a great product. I felt it was extremely overpriced but the small amount of bronzer you get. The packaging is cardboard and not a small compact like I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Sample size TooFaced Chocolate Soleil in Medium/Deep arrive WAY faster than I thought! I have VERY pale skin and platinum hair, but naturally dark hair (Bleach bleach bleach!) and light blue eyes, darker eyebrows and light freckles....I bought the sample size to try the color and it&#x27;s perfect! People always try to sell me the lightest shade of bronzer because of my fairness....But I like the darker accents on my face for contouring and this color is perfect!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! Its so worth the money!!!! Im getting so many compliments : )</li>
    <li> I love this product it might be a smaller travel size but dont let it full you theres a lot of bronzer in this!! The people who are complainig about size clearly dont know how to read &amp; or are crazy to think the full size would be sold for less than a 3rd of the price!? Its price perfect for whay you get as most travel sized products carried by Ulta or Sephora are priced at least $10-$20! ! I love samples they are always just enough as I cant tell you how many full size Bronzers I have that most get wasted because I have so many!&lt;br /&gt;These also are better than the full size because you are paying for more product not the giant fancy package &amp; mirror! Drop that $32 thing &amp; it&#x27;s ruined &amp; basically weeping like a child over your lost money! Drop this &amp; it&#x27;s fine!!! And let&#x27;s face it if you have limited space you working with &amp; lots of products out your going to drop something! !</li>
