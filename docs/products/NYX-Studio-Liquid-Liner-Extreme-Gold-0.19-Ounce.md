      <li>I love this eyeliner...</li>
      <li>I love makeup and love gold eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Love love love this one.</li>
      <li>Let me start by saying that I love the color.</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great shimmery gold color and highly pigmented.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love to use it as a very fine line over a winged liner to give it more of fun</li>
      <li>I am officially a fan of NYX products and plan on trying their other products since this one worked so flawlessly.</li>
      <li>It is easy to take it off.</li>
      <li>This liner is pretty amazing.</li>
      <li>Really pretty and goes on nicely.</li>
      <li>Works fine.  </li>
      <li>It applies smoothly, evenly, and it doesn&#x27;t start to flake or chip as soon as it dries (or at all).</li>
      <li>Fantastic eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Love it for fun festival and</li>
      <li>It looks fabulous -</li>
      <li>The applicator itself is an easy-to-use fine brush, and which makes fine lines, wings, and wing accents SUPER easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It looks GREAT just on top of a black wing liner.  </li>
      <li>I love this so much, the brush is easy so work with.</li>
      <li>The thin brush makes it very easy to apply, and despite its great staying power, it&#x27;s fairly easy to correct mistakes with a q-tip.  </li>
      <li>If I ever want something super longlasting with no worries about smearing, I&#x27;ll wear it.</li>
      <li>Goes on nice and smoothly and seems to last quite a while.  </li>
      <li>main love is the color.</li>
      <li>The color is very intense!</li>
      <li>Finally, it holds up very well at the inner-corner of the eye (much better than most eyeliners).</li>
      <li>So I took a bit of a gamble as I had never used this kind before and it definitely didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This added just the right amount of flair to my eye makeup.</li>
      <li>The color is very vibrant and pretty...extreme gold indeed!</li>
      <li>I am quite pleased and will continue to use it on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>its supa like metallic which is exactly what i wanted.</li>
      <li>:) It goes on smooth and if for some reason you get it into your eyes it wont sting as much as some other products i have tried.</li>
      <li>This liner goes on extremely smoothly and easily with no fuss or mess.</li>
      <li>No reasonable cleaning solution I&#x27;ve used has been able to take it off.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any irritation after removing, but I also don&#x27;t wear it very often.</li>
      <li>I wanted a metallic, not sparkly gold liquid eyeliner for a reasonable price, and this stuff is just what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>it stays on really well.  </li>
      <li>Now the real trick it to keep my mom away from it.</li>
      <li>Easy to use brush applicator for precise control, very vivid gold color and long lasting wear.</li>
      <li>Such a shame because I was excited for it.</li>
      <li>Very light and a tad hard to see if you don&#x27;t use the right colors with it.</li>
      <li>I love using this in combination with the black gel liner.  </li>
      <li>It stays vibrant throughout the day, and doesn&#x27;t chip or flake.  </li>
      <li>I bought the gold color to &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; my black liquid liner, and it works fine.  </li>
      <li>Very good for a little something extra without going too overboard with your makeup, I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really pretty, and classy enough for every day wear.</li>
      <li>Also, I have a lot of folds in my right eye, and if you&#x27;re like me, you have to keep your eyes down for at least 10 seconds to allow it to dry, or else it&#x27;ll transfer easily to the top of your lid</li>
      <li>brush isn&#x27;t thick, so you can get very precise with your lining.</li>
      <li>At this point, I&#x27;m basically waiting for skin cells to flake off before it disappears completely.    </li>
      <li>This stuff is just straight gold, no flecks, no glitter, no extra stuff, just GOLD.  </li>
      <li>I had been looking for a product to replace an old gold liner I had but couldn&#x27;t remember the name of.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t normally wear gold eyeliner, but I bought this for a Halloween costume last year since I couldn&#x27;t find anything locally.</li>
      <li>*to note I do not have any other special allergies or limitation with other make up products.</li>
      <li>I would say that the tip is a bit long and hard to get used to, but once you do, it&#x27;s easy.  </li>
      <li>I tried this and the Aqua-Luxe eyeliner in the same color and this wins hands down by a long shot.</li>

<li> I usually wear it on the outline of my black eyeliner.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little hard to get off</li>
<li> so I&#x27;m not sure if this is the norm or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Do not buy if you are looking for a subtle wash of gold--</li>
<li> a little difficult to get off</li>
<li> and it is, as I mentioned, really hard to get off!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this eyeliner from Target and had to return it because it burned my skin when I applied it. Such a shame because I was excited for it.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I love the color. It is gold the way generic gold should be. I will not be using it on my eyelids, however, because I tested it a week ago and still have traces of it on my arm. No reasonable cleaning solution I&#x27;ve used has been able to take it off. At this point, I&#x27;m basically waiting for skin cells to flake off before it disappears completely.    If I ever want something super longlasting with no worries about smearing, I&#x27;ll wear it. Otherwise, don&#x27;t think so.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner! I usually wear it on the outline of my black eyeliner. This gold color is so shimmer that even if I wiped off my makeup, there would still be a bit of shimmer left on my eyelids, which I like &#x27;cuz, who doesn&#x27;t like shimmer? Overall, this is a great product! :D</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally wear gold eyeliner, but I bought this for a Halloween costume last year since I couldn&#x27;t find anything locally. This liner goes on extremely smoothly and easily with no fuss or mess. I am quite pleased and will continue to use it on a regular basis. I am officially a fan of NYX products and plan on trying their other products since this one worked so flawlessly.</li>
    <li> My favorite eye liner! Great color and goes on smooth. Perfect for day or night!!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice warm gold shade. It&#x27;s more gold than bronze--which I like. The only thing that&#x27;s keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that from what the product looks like in the photo, it looks like you&#x27;re getting a tube that&#x27;s a lot bigger than the 3 inch tall tube. It&#x27;s really pretty, and classy enough for every day wear. I might look for a liner in silver next!</li>
    <li> would not buy again - color is not for me</li>
    <li> I love makeup and love gold eyeliner. I had been looking for a product to replace an old gold liner I had but couldn&#x27;t remember the name of. So I took a bit of a gamble as I had never used this kind before and it definitely didn&#x27;t disappoint. The color is very vibrant and pretty...extreme gold indeed!</li>
    <li> it is truly liquid gold, its got a beautiful metallic finish that is very sturdy! a little difficult to get off but if you want to make sure it stays , then ohh baby will it stay</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good. Love it for fun festival and party kind of makeup looks. I love to use it as a very fine line over a winged liner to give it more of fun look.</li>
    <li> I love using this in combination with the black gel liner.  Very smooth lines with a pop of beautiful gold color.</li>
    <li> Works fine.  I bought the gold color to &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; my black liquid liner, and it works fine.  Goes on nice and smoothly and seems to last quite a while.  It does burn just the slightest bit but that subsides when it dries.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any irritation after removing, but I also don&#x27;t wear it very often.</li>
    <li> I tried this and the Aqua-Luxe eyeliner in the same color and this wins hands down by a long shot. It applies smoothly, evenly, and it doesn&#x27;t start to flake or chip as soon as it dries (or at all). The applicator itself is an easy-to-use fine brush, and which makes fine lines, wings, and wing accents SUPER easy to apply. Finally, it holds up very well at the inner-corner of the eye (much better than most eyeliners). Love love love this one.</li>
    <li> I like the opacity. However, the brush is too flimsy to do the perfect wing so I have to use my own brush</li>
    <li> Really pretty and goes on nicely. Very light and a tad hard to see if you don&#x27;t use the right colors with it.</li>
    <li> This liner is pretty amazing. I wanted it for my Black Widow costume. This liner worked awesome. It&#x27;s bright and glides on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed when washing it off is that it washes off like foil. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of liquid liner so I&#x27;m not sure if this is the norm or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This added just the right amount of flair to my eye makeup. I wish I had taken a photo of the final results. I&#x27;m really glad I got this and I can&#x27;t wait for more Halloweens.</li>
    <li> easy to add to pump up eye makeup; instantly more festive!</li>
    <li> My favorite &#x27;gold&#x27; eyeliner!</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner. It&#x27;s a great shimmery gold color and highly pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush isn&#x27;t thick, so you can get very precise with your lining. However, you do have to reapply since both the brush and liquid are thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main love is the color. It is the perfect shade of gold. I usually wear black liquid liner and then line this on top of the black liner. It looks fabulous - I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments!</li>
    <li> Fantastic eyeliner. It doesn&#x27;t run or fade. Vibrant and not cheap looking.</li>
    <li> Color goes on smoothly and shows up brightly. I do feel like it irritates my skin as the area applied typically burns after initial application. This does go away after a few moments. *to note I do not have any other special allergies or limitation with other make up products.</li>
    <li> So after searching for SO LONG for a gold liner, I have finally found my holy grail.  This stuff is just straight gold, no flecks, no glitter, no extra stuff, just GOLD.  It looks GREAT just on top of a black wing liner.  I would say that the tip is a bit long and hard to get used to, but once you do, it&#x27;s easy.  The staying power is amazing, almost too amazing.  It&#x27;s a little hard to get off and I have to use a cleansing water.  Eye makeup remover doesn&#x27;t work to get this stuff off.  Also, I have a lot of folds in my right eye, and if you&#x27;re like me, you have to keep your eyes down for at least 10 seconds to allow it to dry, or else it&#x27;ll transfer easily to the top of your lid and it is, as I mentioned, really hard to get off!</li>
    <li> its supa like metallic which is exactly what i wanted. it stays on really well.  i wear it bordering my black liquid liner. it looks dope.</li>
    <li> Easy to use brush applicator for precise control, very vivid gold color and long lasting wear. Do not buy if you are looking for a subtle wash of gold-- this is GOLD gold and is opaque</li>
    <li> I love this so much, the brush is easy so work with. The gold doesn&#x27;t look too gaudy either, all in all, a good buy.</li>
    <li> I wanted a metallic, not sparkly gold liquid eyeliner for a reasonable price, and this stuff is just what I wanted.  It&#x27;s incredible.  The thin brush makes it very easy to apply, and despite its great staying power, it&#x27;s fairly easy to correct mistakes with a q-tip.  It stays vibrant throughout the day, and doesn&#x27;t chip or flake.  This is some of the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever bought!  Very good for a little something extra without going too overboard with your makeup, I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner... I&#x27;ve been looking for this color for  some time. This color looks great with my skin tone, and it wears all day.</li>
    <li> I have never had Gold Eyeliner. I Love it. :) It goes on smooth and if for some reason you get it into your eyes it wont sting as much as some other products i have tried. Now the real trick it to keep my mom away from it. LOL</li>
    <li> The color is very intense! The brush is nice and skinny, makes it easy to apply the liner. It stays on for ~3-4h before it starts flaking. It is easy to take it off.</li>
    <li> Excellent look, wife gets many compliments on this style. Got he idea from Bunny Meyer, aka @Grav3yardgirl on YouTube.</li>
