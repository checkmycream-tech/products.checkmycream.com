      <li>The color is spot on and amazing.  </li>
      <li>This product is great for contouring the face because it doesn&#x27;t have too many brown or warm tones in it, instead it is more neutral and gray.  </li>
      <li>Nice contour powde--nice color for shading.  </li>
      <li>I own</li>
      <li>Will consider this my go-to product for a nice finished look.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of a taupe (brown-gray) color, i.e., the color of shadows on your face.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got light-medium skin tone with a yellow/olive underbase and I thought this was the perfect shade to mimick a natural contour.</li>
      <li>This product is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
      <li>Very fine powder-LOVE</li>
      <li>Favorite sculpting powder.  </li>
      <li>I have never even touched bronzing products or contouring products because they&#x27;re always so orange, but the shade of this powder is much more cool.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
      <li>And I love the compact.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve put it on over powder and directly on top of my foundation, and it works both ways.</li>
      <li>If you want more definition or drama, it&#x27;s buildable and believable.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s cheekbone city :)</li>
      <li>Love it....</li>
      <li>I may need to work with it more to have an opinion.</li>
      <li>As a make up artist this works for most skin tones.</li>
      <li>I love the color because its a shadowy-tan unlike my bronzes which are more of an orangey-tan.&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I think i like this better than the TF.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to love this powder.</li>
      <li>It is the perfect contour shade and looks super natural!</li>
      <li>This is the best product for contouring - and it lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>This is the very best contouring product available, I believe, and I know others agree because of its cult following.</li>
      <li>The best thing about this contouring powder is that there is absolutely no orange in it (unlike bronzers).  </li>
      <li>I will definitely buy this compact again, great for sculpting jaw line.. love it and would recommend this product to all, just wish there would have been tips on how to sculpt with it</li>
      <li>It really is that perfect natural contour shade.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to blend and build up.</li>
      <li>I think this would work on most skin tones except the very very fair or dark skin tones.</li>
      <li>It is finely milled and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>This is fabulous, in colour and texture.</li>
      <li>I have played with various makeup to help contour my face and was never quite happy with them.</li>
      <li>i think light to medium to medium-dark.</li>
      <li>I still honestly can&#x27;t believe I paid this much money for contouring powder.......</li>
      <li>Dermstore has free 2 day ship and you can also get 10% off with promo code BZDISCOUNT.  </li>
      <li>All you need is a countering brush and a sweep across areas you want to &amp;#34;sculpt&amp;#34; (like your cheekbones) and a nice, realistic contour is created.</li>
      <li>Great quality product which lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>i love this contour powder soo much, for the price its worth it :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a MUA (Makeup Artist) and this is my secret weapon to achieve the best contour for most of my clients.</li>
      <li>Shadows are naturally more of a grey so traditional bronzers aren&#x27;t the best for contouring in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I use this strictly to create shadows under my cheekbones, jawline and on special occasions</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m quite fair skinned (a 20 in Chanel foundations if that&#x27;s meaningful to anyone), but this doesn&#x27;t look too dark on me at all.</li>
      <li>As expected, this sculpting powder is great.</li>
      <li>Use a high quality brush and you will love this powder.</li>
      <li>At first, I thought the color was too light to do anything on my medium skin.</li>
      <li>It looks dark when first applied, but blends beautifully.</li>
      <li>AND IT&#x27;S VERY PIGMENTED!!</li>
      <li>The texture is very light, soft, buttery.</li>
      <li>However, I feel like i&#x27;ll use it when i&#x27;m trying to get a bit more natural contour</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i love this contour powder soo much, for the price its worth it :) it gives natural cheekbones .</li>
    <li> So here&#x27;s the thing: I didn&#x27;t want to love this powder. I&#x27;ve been searching for a good contouring powder for almost a year now and after reading reviews for this Kevyn Aucoin sculptor, I was skeptical to say the least. I decided to try it in hopes that all of the positive reviews would hold true. When it arrived, it was much smaller than I had anticipated. It&#x27;s almost eyeshadow small. But then I started playing around with it, starting with the dreaded nose contour and it was like I had applied magic to my face. The color is perfect (not too ashy, red, gray, or tan), it blends beautifully, and the color holds throughout the day. I&#x27;m completely sold on this product, which I didn&#x27;t want to be due to the cost to size ratio but it is genuinely amazing.</li>
    <li> Love this sculpting powder!!! It&#x27;s pigmented, yet buildable. It is the perfect contour shade and looks super natural!</li>
    <li> Has a gray hue, wonderful for contouring.</li>
    <li> Best sculpting creme ever!</li>
    <li> I have an olive toned medium skin. This powder doesn&#x27;t leave me a trace on the face but people did say my face is smaller on the days I wear it. Great for me.</li>
    <li> As expected, this sculpting powder is great. However, I feel like i&#x27;ll use it when i&#x27;m trying to get a bit more natural contour it doesn&#x27;t give you the dramatic or the bronze look you&#x27;re looking for so know your purpose before buying it.</li>
    <li> So when this arrived I thought that I just wasted my money and that kit wouldn&#x27;t show up in my skin. I was wrong!! This compact is small, and there&#x27;s not a lot of product... But with that being said, A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!! AND IT&#x27;S VERY PIGMENTED!! It&#x27;s the perfect color to create a shadow on fair to medium tan skin tones. I don&#x27;t use this as a bronzer because it would look terrible, it&#x27;s far to cool to be used all over the face and would make you look either dirty or skeletal. I use this strictly to create shadows under my cheekbones, jawline and on special occasions I create shadows on my nose to make it appear slimmer. It&#x27;s amazing. Yes it&#x27;s small, but since you need so little, this will last a long, long time.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for contouring - and it lasts a long time. It&#x27;s not cheap but you will have it for a while.</li>
    <li> Love this contour powder! Blendable. Don&#x27;t need much at all. Use a fan brush and lightly brush on cheeks or jawline to thin the face out. Can use on eyes too. Very versatile. The color is very natural, too. No warmth, not orange at all, but not grey like some others. More like the color of an actual shadow on your skin. I think this would work on most skin tones except the very very fair or dark skin tones.</li>
    <li> At first, I thought the color was too light to do anything on my medium skin. But it comes across your cheek at a believable shadowy color -- perfect, of course, for contouring. This is the very best contouring product available, I believe, and I know others agree because of its cult following. It doesn&#x27;t break me out, either!</li>
    <li> Love this contour powder! It&#x27;s beautiful and not orangey at all.</li>
    <li> I still honestly can&#x27;t believe I paid this much money for contouring powder....... but this sculpting powder is great. I am the palest of pale and this powder creates a really nice illusion of a shadow. I rarely ever use it -- only for really big events or for Halloween, so it will probably last me forever. I have never even touched bronzing products or contouring products because they&#x27;re always so orange, but the shade of this powder is much more cool.&lt;br /&gt;In all, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth the money. I really depends. You have to really want to contour your face, which is hard to pull off in every day life. But if you can pull contouring off, go for it -- it&#x27;s the best out there.</li>
    <li> Nice contour powde--nice color for shading.  Great quality product which lasts a long time.  Will consider this my go-to product for a nice finished look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a MUA (Makeup Artist) and this is my secret weapon to achieve the best contour for most of my clients. I don&#x27;t recommend it for anyone who may be a deeper shade darker then MAC shade NW50 because it tends not to show. Highly recommended and will be buying this product for a lifetime. RIP Kevin Aucoin &amp;#34;Genius!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have played with various makeup to help contour my face and was never quite happy with them. I accidentally stumbled upon this product after being so frustrated with all my other contouring products.This product is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used!! Other contouring makeups give you a dirty appearance, and either looks too dark or too light on the face. This product is velvety smooth and blends in seamlessly and gives the right amount of shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only small caveat is that you have to be gentle with the product when swirling on your brush as the powder is very delicate and easily flakes off. Other than that...I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because I love this product! I wish I found this product sooner!</li>
    <li> I was sold a 3.1g tester size box without a sponge. While the product itself is great, its size is not.</li>
    <li> I really like this contouring powder.  It&#x27;s a great shade that creates a subtle natural contour vs. an orangey look. I wish it was a little darker so I didn&#x27;t have to build it up as much.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I hoped to receive this product as it was initially advertised on this page (6.5 grams), but I received the newer size of 3.1 grams. The price I paid for the size of the product was not at all competitive when other retailers were selling the 3.1 gram compact for $44. It is fraud to advertise one thing, and sell another. I received my Sculpting Powder with a fingerprint in it, and this alone was reason enough for me to return this product immediately. Not sanitary at all. It also wasn&#x27;t packaged very well, so it was necessary that I take my business elsewhere. This sort of behavior is insulting.</li>
    <li> I may need to work with it more to have an opinion.</li>
    <li> I went from a woman wishing for check bones to feeling totally defined. I absolutely love this sculpting powder! The grey tone makes it look very natural look while leaving you feeling totally defined.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am NC 35 in mac and this works perfectly. It blends naturally with a little product. I use nars ITA brush to apply. It is very comparable to Tom Ford shade and illuminate. I think i like this better than the TF. It  has little amount of product on the pan, but wont stop me from buying once I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d had my eye on this powder for awhile and finally pulled the trigger.  It does not disappoint. I am very fair and although it is dark, it looks very natural (it&#x27;s creating shadows, afterall).  I&#x27;m still experimenting with what brushes to use with it but I&#x27;m incredibly happy with it (I use it with the Candlelight powder as well).</li>
    <li> This is fabulous, in colour and texture. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of different contouring kits, taupe blushers and bronzers to contour, and they all ended up looking like stripes (orange or ashen). Kevyn Aucoin&#x27;s looks like a natural shadow. I&#x27;ve put it on over powder and directly on top of my foundation, and it works both ways. For me, the best way of applying it is with a pointed blusher brush, as it gives me softer definition than the enclosed sponge - dusting it down the back of the cheekbone and blending upwards on to it, then around the temples + hairline and lastly (and most lightly) around the jaw. I&#x27;m quite fair skinned (a 20 in Chanel foundations if that&#x27;s meaningful to anyone), but this doesn&#x27;t look too dark on me at all. It&#x27;s spot on. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> THE product when it comes to shading and contouring, haven&#x27;t found any other product that comes close when it comes to the quality and the color of this powder. Hoarded quite a few boxes of the older edition since the new edition has significantly less product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been around the block with varying contour powders or kits (Smashbox, Hourglass, Anastasia) and a lot of them are either difficult to apply, streaky, orange or fake. This powder is perfect. It is finely milled and goes on smoothly. All you need is a countering brush and a sweep across areas you want to &amp;#34;sculpt&amp;#34; (like your cheekbones) and a nice, realistic contour is created. If you want more definition or drama, it&#x27;s buildable and believable. To address issues of cost, yes, it was smaller than expected, but not skimpy, and you really are getting a quality product.</li>
    <li> I am fair skinned, blonde hair, blue eye so I was afraid this might look stripy on me but it doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s very sheer and you can build on it. I just wanted to eccentuate my cheekbones and jawline a little and this does that. I love the color because its a shadowy-tan unlike my bronzes which are more of an orangey-tan.&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T use the brush provided though. Use a high quality brush and you will love this powder.</li>
    <li> This is AWESOME! its great because it works on darker skin tones... i think light to medium to medium-dark. It just looks realistic and as thought you just have a shadow, which is what you are looking for when conturing your face.. you want it to look as real as possible, and this does the trick. Love It.. recommended to anyone looking for a great sculpting powder.</li>
    <li> Love it perfect shade to contour and give u a slime face</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got light-medium skin tone with a yellow/olive underbase and I thought this was the perfect shade to mimick a natural contour. It&#x27;s a non-shimmery tone so it looks like real shadows instead of makeup. It&#x27;s easy to blend and build up. Just be careful applying it, go slow and light and build up if needed.</li>
    <li> This product is great for contouring the face because it doesn&#x27;t have too many brown or warm tones in it, instead it is more neutral and gray.  This is perfect for creating a shadow effect on the face.  It is a great product with smooth application.  It is not powdery when applied and looks very natural.</li>
    <li> Favorite sculpting powder.  Great color.</li>
    <li> Awesome contour powder. Very easy to blend, payoff is great. The color is perfect for light-medium skin tones and swatches a grey-brown shade that is precisely what you need for a contour color. Shadows are naturally more of a grey so traditional bronzers aren&#x27;t the best for contouring in my opinion. The texture is very light, soft, buttery. It&#x27;s not powdery and there is no fall out. Tap your brush in gently and apply color--no waste. It lasts all day. This is a pricey gem but definitely worth the purchase price. I can see this being a staple in my kit. Will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> Best powder ever. Lasted for half a year? Do not need a lot, follow the directions and it&#x27;s cheekbone city :)</li>
    <li> This is great for contouring.  As others note, it&#x27;s a cool-toned brown, so not as good for bronzing, but will give a nice shadow under cheekbones.  And I love the compact.  It&#x27;s elegant and tiny, which makes it so portable for travel.  Most bronzers seem to come in huge compacts or unworkable little cardboard boxes that do not travel.  For a weekend trip, this can easily fit in any makeup bag and allow me to get dimension for an evening look without bringing a lot of heavy, cumbersome makeup gear.</li>
    <li> Some very strong stuff!  I really had to learn how to use this properly.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Also another new permanent item in my makeup bag (along with celestial highlighter) it is amazing for contouring, a perfect brown/gray which is perfect and what you want for contouring. It is not orange. Very fine powder-LOVE</li>
    <li> The best thing about this contouring powder is that there is absolutely no orange in it (unlike bronzers).  It&#x27;s kind of a taupe (brown-gray) color, i.e., the color of shadows on your face.  You can be as light-handed or as heavy-handed as you want in applying it.  Use a good brush to apply the powder, not the sponge that comes with it.</li>
    <li> I love this! you only need a tiny amount and it looks great. I&#x27;m very pale and most contour powders look very orangey on me since this one has grayish undertones, it can be very subtle (you can build it up if you want)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m love with this product!  The color is spot on and amazing.  As a make up artist this works for most skin tones. A must have for your kit.  I love it so much I even bought one for my personal make up bag.</li>
    <li> Great contour powder!  Perfect color! Quality product!  I would say the best contour powder out there.  This brand is pricy but worth it.</li>
    <li> Oh my! Maybe it&#x27;s my skin tone but this is the most perfect contour powder ever.  I own MAC, Bobbi, NARS and the list goes on, but Kevyn Aucoin&#x27;s sculpting powder is the winner.  I feel like I should Costco buy (pallet qty) in case they stop making it!  It&#x27;s so subtle yet impactful.  Love it....</li>
    <li> This is a great powder for contouring the face. It blends well, never looks powdery or dry, and is cool toned enough to mimic the natural shadows on the face.  I have light coloring (nw18-20) and this works great for me.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that&#x27;s in the mood for that chiseled sculpted look. It really is that perfect natural contour shade. If you have very fair to medium or olive skin the medium sculpting powder would work best for you.</li>
    <li> I purchased earlier this year and after a lot of problems with technique, I finally found a way to make it work for me.  I reordered recently.  It was to be a 2nd day ship.  It arrived 5 days late and poorly packaged in an envelope.  Then it was NOT what you see here.  It was not .23 oz / 6.5G.  It was half that.  I am returning because it smacks of fraud when you do not get what you ordered.  I have since ordered it from Dermstore.com.  It is the smaller version but it is not as expensive as this bait &#x27;n&#x27; switch item.  Dermstore has free 2 day ship and you can also get 10% off with promo code BZDISCOUNT.  I&#x27;m tired of merchants on this site sending something other than is described and pictured.  I just sent another order back for this same reason.  Amazon, please do something about this.</li>
    <li> I will definitely buy this compact again, great for sculpting jaw line.. love it and would recommend this product to all, just wish there would have been tips on how to sculpt with it</li>
    <li> I bought it for countouring my face for the camera (I&#x27;m an actress.)  It blends beautifully (I&#x27;m not an expert at this, believe me.)  It has a silky quality.  Exactly what I expected from the brand started by the famed makeup genius.</li>
    <li> Mine actually came with a brush rather than a sponge, but I prefer a brush so woo hoo.  The color does not look anything like the photo, which again is good in my opinion.  :)  I  am light skinned but not super pale so went with the medium for contour.</li>
    <li> I love this powder! It looks dark when first applied, but blends beautifully. For me, though, four stars instead of five because the packaging is so small. Like size of a single eyeshadow.</li>
