      <li>This is one of the best facial treatments I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>

      <li>I will buy more Dove products.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Or that a washcloth is better.</li>

      <li>I was planning on buying an item 3 if not 4 times more $ than this item because it had better reviews and is a brand I am familiar with.</li>
      <li>Great item, seamless sale transaction and shipping.</li>
      <li>I am a guy, yes I shave, and wash my face, but this is an excellent tool to get your face feeling nice, and clean from dried up oil, etc.</li>

      <li>SkinVitalizer is a much more economical way to improve your skin.</li>
      <li>My skin feels so smooth and refreshed..</li>
      <li>fabulously smooth.</li>
      <li>Since this item is no longer available...</li>

      <li>What I love the most is during the winter my hands get really chapped and blistered.</li>
      <li>Very effective facial cleansing device</li>
      <li>and I learned very quickly the warning is mild compared to the sting and pain the soap causes.  </li>
      <li>The original unit I purchased has lasted for years.  </li>
      <li>It is definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>It does clean your face as you would expect &amp; as it proclaims to.</li>

      <li>It makes your face feel clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>BUT you go through the soap-filled scrubbers quickly.</li>
      <li>Bought something much better at our local drug store for not a lot more money.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the extra attention and the vibrations get the medicine deeper to the source of the problem which has cleared existing acne AND prevented more.</li>
      <li>It was easy to use but imediately found it producded way too much suds.  </li>
      <li>I essentially love all Dove products, but I was very surprised that I didn&#x27;t care for this.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sadly, I&#x27;m guessing they don&#x27;t make pillows for these anymore.</li>
    <li> I had one of the first SkinVitalizers that got recalled. I bought the second version too. Fell in love with it AND the various types of cleansing pillows available for different skincare needs. The massaging vibrations and cleansing treatments were relaxing and made my skin feel and look better. THEN the refill pillows started disappearing and now the entire line is discontinued :( When the cleansing pillows are available they&#x27;re comparatively expensive, honestly NOT WORTH THE ADDED EXPENSE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the device for helping me to focus on problem areas, making it easier to have better skincare and even some pampering. I&#x27;ve taken to using cotton rounds, cosmetic pads with my own cleansers and lotions as the different pillows for exfoliating, brightening, and mature skin vanished. When fibers clog the velcro, let it get totally dry then use tape to capture the fibers like old-school lint trapping :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one for my son&#x27;s back-ne is used with acne cleansing pads like [[ASIN:B001G7PJAC Oxy Maximum Daily Cleansing Pads, 90 pads (Pack of 3)]] I&#x27;m sure the extra attention and the vibrations get the medicine deeper to the source of the problem which has cleared existing acne AND prevented more.</li>
    <li> Good inexpensive tool.</li>
    <li> Great for the price but I did have some problems. The pads provided, if they got too wet, would move around as I used them on my face. It is very easy to wet them too much and you end up with a lathery extravaganza. I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s better than just using a towel but it does make washing my face more &#x27;fun&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But those are small problems. It works as advertised. No one can buy this and feel ripped off. There is something very pleasant about that!</li>
    <li> My face could not look and feel smoother. Just wish that smaller packages of pillows were available for purchase.</li>
    <li> I am one that values the opinions of others and like most read reviews on an item prior to buying it. I was planning on buying an item 3 if not 4 times more $ than this item because it had better reviews and is a brand I am familiar with. I have better skin thanks to a recent Zeno purchase however you still have to wash your face several times a day. My old regime was using a puff buff and a cleanser that I felt was best suited for my skin. If it is a facial cleanser chances are it is in my toilette closet. When I bought this I thought this item would be my back up item. However, it has proven to do A LOT more than I thought. I have heard complaints about it not vibrating and that you have to do so. Or that a washcloth is better. After using it for several weeks here is my review. First of all let&#x27;s face it, if you are left handed it is easy to clean the left side of your face and vice versa. I don&#x27;t know about you but when washing my face and usually taking makeup off I leave the water running to rinse my buff puff. If it is a washcloth you not only get stains on it but it is all over your face and you waste more cleanser with a washcloth. I used the pads that came with the device and wetted them as instructed. It lathered up really well and I did not keep the water running. I felt it cleaned not only my face better but I was able to get my neck and side of my neck which breakout frequently as well. The best thing about this device is it is NOT just capable of using the pads intended for it. I am not a huge Dove fan and although it cleans well sometimes I need something stronger. I have stuck a buff puff on the device and then put on a heavier cleanser and it works great! I also have stuck face pads for a well know company that is more abrasive and also the Ponds facial clothes. They ALL stick to this device and I find myself cleaning my face a lot longer and cleaning it better. What I love the most is during the winter my hands get really chapped and blistered. Or even in the summer if you have a cut on your hand this device is a dream. No more running your hands under the water and applying it directly to the harsh chemicals and rinsing. The device is my fingers and it has truly helped my hands and skin since it touch my face, not my bare hands. I love this product and am glad I gave it a try and knowing it is so diverse I could not be happier. I think for the price you get what you paid for and a whole lot more! It is definitely worth it!even in the summer if you have a cut on your hand this device is a dream.

    <li> I purchased the Dove Skin Vitalizer on 2/16/09 at Shop Rite for $10.99. This product does not do anything for your shin and it is a waste of money and time. When I went to return it to Shop Rite on 2/23/09, they informed me that the manufacture will not give them credit therefore they can not take it back. Well, Dove, I will not take it for free at this point.    And the ONE star is me being kind.</li>
    <li> I have been using the pillows for several years and love them.  Suddenly couldn&#x27;t get them in the store so was very excited that I could get them on line.  Saw this product and ordered right away - really love it, but now I am finding it more difficult to find the pillows AND increasingly more expensive.  I could not find this product on the Dove web site which leads me to believe it will be completely discontinued soon.</li>
    <li> The cotton pad gets caught on the face.  I am a man, and I cannot use this on the area of my face where whiskers grow...no matter how clean-shaven.  It is impossible to exfoliate with cotton pillows.  Besides, all the device did was vibrate, which does nothing for exfoliation.  It should spin.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting a small little facial massager that I could go out and buy skin cream and apply to spong then apply but the dove skin cleaner is in the pad WOW! I love it you have to get it here and now you will be glad you did!</li>
    <li> This products gives your skin the smooth finish look. I would recommend this product to any one who desires this look to their face.</li>
    <li> I love it, it feels good when I use it, after using it my skin feels so smooth and soft. only problem I have with this product is I can&#x27;t seem to find the replacement dove wipes in the store. I have been to several different stores and still have not found them. I guess I will have to find them online.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how disappointing this product is!  Does it work? Yes. But not any better than if you just used a facial cleansing disposable cloth/wipe.  I thought by it being a \\&quot;massager,\\&quot; that it would actually affect the way it cleans, as in helping to exfoliate my skin. But all it does is vibrate. There is ABSOLUTELY no need for that.  It has no affect on the cleansing ability.</li>
    <li> it was o.k., for the money....  It does the job.....  It was not what I expected, I had one before and it was more sturdy, this one looks like a toy......... but thanks anyway.</li>
    <li> I was given this item[[ASIN:B000MANVXG Dove SkinVitalizer with 1 Massager and 6 Exfoliating Pillows]] as a gift; thought it was a frivilous but fun item. It was easy to use but imediately found it producded way too much suds.  I had read the warning about avoiding the eyes and tried too, but the massager threw the soap too close to the eyes and I learned very quickly the warning is mild compared to the sting and pain the soap causes.  I have never had anything burn my eye like this soap.  My husband flushed my eye with no less than a gallon of saline water before the sting even began to  subside.  My suggestion to those who use this item is have a container of saline solution handy, or do what I did: throw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> its kinda slimy feeling i think you could do more with a scrub than this. i dont use it anymore instead i use the indian clay mask and a deep conditioning cleanser and my face has been amazing!!</li>
    <li> Purchased this item about 3 weeks ago and I use it when I&#x27;m in the shower. My face really does look a lot smoother.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best facial treatments I&#x27;ve ever used.  simple, easy, and inexpensive.  Gently massages face and neck and leaves these areas feeling clean and terrific.  And I can buy soap/scrub pads in boxes of 40 (CVS Brand) that fit this unit nicely and aren&#x27;t as over-priced as the Dove cleansing pads - I really love it!</li>
    <li> After using this product you may never want to use wash cloths again. The SkinVitalizer gives just enough agitation to provide a GENTLE yet deep cleansing. It is a MUST HAVE addition to your daily beauty regiment. Since this item is no longer available... you may want to research sellers on AMAZON, EBAY, etc. for refill pillows before purchasing and stock up!. I purchased a second machine as a spare.</li>
    <li> Let me put it this way-  its a nice scrubbing system but vibration+ skin vitalizing thing what they claim for does not seem that good.  For its performance price of 10 bux(walmart) seems  bit high too.    you can give it a try-  1. but don&#x27;t expect too much.  2.You can do same thing with regular scrub... I am not sure if skin vibration will put some effects in long run. so far I don&#x27;t see any.Plus I find they scrubbing pad a little bit harder too that I am not comfortable in using them everyday,</li>
    <li> article very useful and comfortable for personal hygiene, I use it in the face, neck, arms and upper back and stay like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I recommend</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Poor exfoliation and the cleanser is too much for one use but I don&#x27;t want to use it multiple times. Yuck. The actual unit is okay. But useless if it doesn&#x27;t clean or exfoliate.</li>
    <li> I recently reviewed a \\&quot;healthy skin\\&quot; drink called [[ASIN:B0021AF9GC Glowelle Powder Pomegranate Lychee 30 Day Powder Stick Pack, 30-Count Box]]. I gave it a pretty good review, because I liked it, but noted it&#x27;s very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove SkinVitalizer is a much more economical way to improve your skin. It doesn&#x27;t have vitamins and the attendant benefits of that, but I&#x27;ve often marveled at how soft my skin always feels and how there&#x27;s a noticeable glow afterward no matter if I use the more exfoliating side or not. I&#x27;ve been using this product since autumn of last year and it is part of my regular routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perhaps anecdotal to mention that within a week of first using the product I was buying cigarettes for a family member and got carded, which isn&#x27;t bad at 40. I jokingly said to my husband that I found my new fave product, but it turned out to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the pads are intended for one use, but there&#x27;s enough cleanser that it could easily stretch to two face washings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, before  using it you want to mention it to anyone in hearing distance of the bathroom, because it makes this loud buzzing noise that, without telling them, you could only hope they would attribute to an electric toothbrush. ::grin::&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To tell you how much I love this product, I often buy out the shelf of replacement pillows and hoard them in fear the product will be discontinued. I never want to be without this product and while the benefits are strictly external, I truly feel Dove is good for my skin, and that the SkinVitalizer gives that little extra bit of exfoliation and massage to make this a terrific part of a beauty  regimen.</li>
    <li> i expected this  will do some deep cleaning.  but it doesn&#x27;t.  i will not recommend the product, a waste of money.  better yet use bare fingers to clean face.</li>
    <li> Well I purchased this product thinking it would be as good as a Clarisonic.  Not even close!  The pad was akward as it stuck with velcro and well it just didn&#x27;t do the job.  I eventually purchased the Clarisonic and forgot about this product until I was reviewing my purchases here on Amazon.  It must be in the back of the drawer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m somewhat of a new customer on Amazon, so far I&#x27;m very pleased with  everything I&#x27;v ordered. I believe Amazon.com is a fantastic site to have.  Thank You Amazon for being here. As far as the Dove Skin Vitalizer along   with the Cleansing Pillows that are supposed to refresh the face as well   as make it look and feel younger, well these product are amazing! Since I&#x27;v  purchased these products, they&#x27;ve been working wonders. I&#x27;v incorporated  them into my daily beauty routine. To me it&#x27;s all about beauty! Thank  You Amazon, and thank you Dove.    Gina.</li>
    <li> It works fine, I just would like not to have to change the pillows so often.</li>
    <li> Entirely to small...cheaply made and you will have to buy refill pads. I won&#x27;t recommend for any one...bad deal here</li>
    <li> This product arrived as scheduled. No items were missing or damaged.  Product was sealed. Products is functional. I did not gain any results. The pads are soft and smooth, therefore the skin lacks the feel of the vibration.</li>
    <li> I love the way my face feels after I use this. The only drawback is having to purchase the exfoliating pillows instead of just using your favorite cleansing soap. And for being battery operated, it isn&#x27;t loud at all &amp; is light weight &amp; fits easily in your hand. It does clean your face as you would expect &amp; as it proclaims to.</li>
    <li> I bought it for a friend of mine. I have noticed its effect on her face and the wrinkles !</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed this product and find its helping my skins appearance. I would encourage anyone to try this.</li>
    <li> I essentially love all Dove products, but I was very surprised that I didn&#x27;t care for this.  My biggest problem is the way the thing vibrates while holding it (I know that sounds odd since it&#x27;s supposed to do that).  I just feel it vibrates excessively and it ends up tickling my hands and my face -- I even feel the vibration in my jaw as I&#x27;m scrubbing my face and it bugs me enough that I can&#x27;t use it anymore.  So, instead I just don&#x27;t turn it on.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, IT IS GREAT FOR ANY SKIN TYPE. I HAVE VERY OILY SKIN WHICH BASICALLY SHINE ALL THE TIME. AND I HATE IT,SO I BOUGHT THIS ITEM LIKE A YEAR AGO AND IM STILL USING IT. IT&#x27;S GREAT FOR MY OILY SKIN,PLUS AFTER I USE IT MY FACE DOES NOT SHINE ALL THROUGH THE DAY OR NIGHT. IT FEELS LIFTED UP FROM DIRT,OIL, AND OTHER IMPURITIES IN MY SKIN. BEST THING IT HAS TO SIDES THE EXFOILIATE SIDE AND THE CLEANSING SIDE. THAT&#x27;S HOW I KNOW IT WORKING BECAUSE OF THE TWO SIDES THAT CARE FOR YOUR FACE(AND OF COURSE WHEN I SEE THE NASTY DIRT AND OIL ON THE PAD). BUT I WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT AND THEY ONLY COST ALL LITTLE BIT FOR THE PADS SO IT&#x27;S WAY WORTH IT. I ALSO BOUGHT THE NEUTROGENA WAVE BUT THAT DIDN&#x27;T WORK OUT WELL FOR ME. SO I WILL BUY THIS ALL THE TIME FOR NOW ON!!! THANK&#x27;S DOVE KEEP IT COMING!!!</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the product facial is as it says in the description! thanks for compliance. 100% recommend them greetings</li>
    <li> When buying this product, I thought I was getting an exfoliating machine. It&#x27;s a little bit different. It&#x27;s more of a cleanser, it feels good, but not what I expected..</li>
    <li> I use this thing every day and it definitely makes my skin feel smoother and cleaner. It&#x27;s gentle, but yet still removes all the dead stuff, especially when used often.     It&#x27;s waterproof so I just leave it in the shower, and the face pads are usually good for 2 uses instead of just one.     The only thing I would name as a con is that it doesn&#x27;t hold the pad as firm anymore because the little adhesive stuff (like velcro) is getting full of little pieces of the face pads.</li>
    <li> I see an improvement every time I use it. The little wand is not very expensive and I used mine for a year before I decided to replace it. I do this treatment on my face and exposed skin like arms. One side of the pad is exfoliating and then I turn it over for the moisturizer. Sometimes when my feet are very dry I use it on my feet! It feels very nice, wakes up the skin with mild massage and moisturizes. I do it for a few minutes before turning on the shower.</li>
    <li> It good, but you need refills :( ...I wish I invested in one with a scrubber/brush, cuz all though this product is good, you may want to exfoliate alil more!</li>
    <li> The face cleanser works okay doesn&#x27;t leave my skin as soft as I thought it would. The vibration is a nice feature is nice though. Cleaning pads are hard to find.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this facial cleanser. It cleaned well and left my skin so soft that I did not need to apply moisturizer as I always need to using soap and water. I loved it until I went searching for replacement cleanser pads. When I couldn&#x27;t find any in the stores, I searched online. At Dove.com they said the item is discontinued and had no information on finding the pillows anywhere. I did find a pack of 14 for about $32 which is ludicrous as the handle itself is half that cost. Why anyone would buy the handle when you can&#x27;t find the pads or pay a lot for ones you can find, is beyond me. One review talked about using other brands successfully on this item and I guess I will try that before throwing it out.&lt;br /&gt;Bring it back, DOVE!!</li>
    <li> I love it. I am upset that they discontinued these. I did not find out until after I went to find refills and they were $50.</li>
    <li> I used to have one of these and loved it. But when I ordered this new one, it is broken. No matter what battery I add, the massager  won&#x27;t work. I noticed that the package had been opened and taped shut. So beware of this company. It deserves no stars. And I am out of my money and can&#x27;t get the massager.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. My skin feels so smooth and refreshed.. I haven&#x27;t seen a complete transformation YET, I still like this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent shipping on time. Second of all yes it does have a recall on it ,but who on earth is going to scrape their face??? Works well, does exactly what it says it does. Has given my skin a softer younger appearance, and evened out my skin tone. Excellent product, excellent price, and excellent shipping!</li>
    <li> Shipping came in as expected &amp; the product leaves face soft !</li>
    <li> I do not care for this product. I did not like the way it vibrated. Prolonged use irritated my skin.</li>
    <li> Very effective facial cleansing device</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and it works great.  I&#x27;m disappointed that it&#x27;s a discontinued product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a a very good cleanser and with dove I figured there a good brand . My skin feels the same way as before I cleansed . will not buy again</li>
    <li> It vibrates when you turn it on as you cleanse your face. I didn&#x27;t really like it, but if you like massaging face while you cleanse it, then it&#x27;s for you.</li>
    <li> love this little skin cleansing machine, but you can&#x27;t buy the pads anymore, if you can they are outrageously expensive, I think Dove discontinued it for some reason unknown.  But I love the way my skin feels after using this in the show on my face.  fabulously smooth.</li>
    <li> My face feels soooo good but it was  not exactly what I had expected. I would purchase again even with the unexpected aspects.</li>
    <li> The pads stick to bottom of moving thingy and work for 1 or 2 times and then make a mess.</li>
    <li> I used this when it was sold in Walmart/Walgreens/CVS way back when. I could not find it in stores anymore so I took to the web and found it. This works well for your face to clean out your pores and other crap off of your face. I am a guy, yes I shave, and wash my face, but this is an excellent tool to get your face feeling nice, and clean from dried up oil, etc. Would not be a mistake to buy.</li>
    <li> This is a ridiculous product.  The base unit has no value.  It barely moves.  Additionally, you can only use it with the Dove produced exfoliating \\&quot;pillow\\&quot; which has copious amounts of soap in it.  The soap drips all over.  The pads are basically one use, you would not want to use the same pad a day later after your old make-up has been sitting it for 24 hours - EWWWW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the product.</li>
    <li> I returned this....very cheap appearing.  Bought something much better at our local drug store for not a lot more money.</li>
    <li> The original unit I purchased has lasted for years.  I decide to get a backup and found out it was discontinued.  So happy to find it on Amazon.  Great item, seamless sale transaction and shipping.</li>
    <li> I get a good exfoliating with this product. It feel very good. I will buy more Dove products. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I had this last year and it was awesome. Then, one day, I lost it... bummer so i&#x27;ll buy it again in november (which is right before winter)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my Mom fo Christmas and she uses often, loves it, great product and I will probably buy one for myself.</li>
    <li> I bought this item expecting more from it but I don&#x27;t feel that it cleans my face like advertised. It&#x27;s easy to use but prefer to spend my money on something that works a little better</li>
    <li> The Revitalizer arrived earlier than promised, was packaged well, priced reasonably and is of good quality. I am a happy customer.</li>
    <li> Due to highly sensitive skin, I cannot use the actual soapy pad (though I&#x27;ve only read good reports about them), I have, however, rinsed them out, added a bit of olive oil and gently massaged that into my skin, increasing the circulation in the tender facial tissues.  A little creativity served me well here.</li>
    <li> Was in good condition and I liked using this. It makes your face feel clean and fresh. I am glad it came with 2 replacement pads or I am not sure where I would get more. I&#x27;ll have to look for more later.</li>
    <li> I love this dove skin Vitali zero facial cleaner is the best, it clearly cleans outstanding, i have never had soft supper skin till 2_14_15, thanks to this dove machine, I want more dove sponges that fit this unit, have amazon get these sponges to buy now.</li>
    <li> The Dove product for vitalizering and cleansing the face works great. I liked it so much I ordered two more for family members. Great price and great product.</li>
    <li> Easy to use for people with hand disabilities. Cleans well.</li>
    <li> This product is not one to purchase if trying to save money by not buying the more expensive ones on the market. Its the pads that go with it that you need to price first.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this product. It is just like the ones you find in the store but not so expensive. Have used it a least 2 times and my skin feels great.</li>
    <li> I love this messager, it gives you a really deep clean and I really like the foaming action.  And it gets down into your pores for an awesome clean and makes my face feel fantastic.</li>
    <li> Nice item, exfoliates very well. Problem is I can&#x27;t find the refill pads in any stores like I used to years ago, so I have not used this in a while. It does make face glow.</li>
    <li> This item is cheap, definitely not the high end massager that it is made to look like. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> ,Refreshing facial massager, nice product.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product BUT you go through the soap-filled scrubbers quickly. They&#x27;re really only good once so you&#x27;re talking about a new pack a week. Leaves skin very clean and soft though</li>
    <li> I hate the fact that I didn&#x27;t read that you can&#x27;t no longer get the little clouds to replace them.</li>
