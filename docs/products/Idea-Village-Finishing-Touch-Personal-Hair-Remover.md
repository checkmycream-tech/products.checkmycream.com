      <li>Very nice!</li>
      <li>They are great for the elderly to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also great for trimming wayward ear hairs.  </li>
      <li>However, I have had my Finishing Touch for almost a year, and I am happy with it.</li>
      <li>so this is a great way to trim aroudn ears in between the cuts.  </li>
      <li>The sellers are wonderful and quick to send product.</li>
      <li>Its compact, you can carry it with you and cute too, mine has the jewel cap on it, which is just so attractive.  </li>
      <li>So you better hope your junky product works or you are SOL!  </li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>The light on it is great.</li>
      <li>I owned 1 of these years ago and liked it.</li>
      <li>I have had this product before but this new one is improved and I am very happy with it.</li>
      <li>Just bought one, works fine, good accessories...and ony $15....</li>
      <li>I should be able to receive some kind of compensation for my time and money.</li>
      <li>They work really great and just keep on working, and it&#x27;s kinda fun too.  </li>
      <li>It is, by far, the best hair removal tool on the market.</li>
      <li>But that was fine with me!</li>
      <li>It worked ok.  </li>
      <li>I changed many batteries and fiddled and fiddled, but it won&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>My spouse &amp; I both love it.  </li>
      <li>The trimmer &amp; attachment both fit in the handy travel pouch.  </li>
      <li>Most everywhere, it will remove all the hair you need removed.</li>
      <li>is more than the product is worth, but I sure won&#x27;t buy or do business with this company again!</li>
      <li>This one will do a good job for not too much money.</li>
      <li>Since it&#x27;s about the size of a tube of mascara, it&#x27;s easy to take on trips or even slip in a purse.  </li>
      <li>I use it strictly for facial hair removal and it works great.  </li>
      <li>Was suppose to get a free compact mirror with the purchase as advertised which was NOT in the box, also the light did not work.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to get razor smooth skin</li>
      <li>The second one was fine, works great and is very gentle on the skin.  </li>
      <li>They have a new, sturdier version of this out now that I found in CVS - it was a nice improvement.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just supposed to clean you up in between haircuts and keep your neck clean.</li>
      <li>the item description says it \\&quot;erases the hair\\&quot; with its special \\&quot;micro-technology.\\</li>
      <li>I also would like to know why I&#x27;m not getting a full refund of  $32.99.</li>
      <li>Not only is the speed more than impressive, but the blades are put together in a way that it is not easy to get cut, nicked, or injured in anyway.</li>
      <li>This thing is durable, easy to clean (after multiple uses), and incredibly comfortable to use anywhere on your body.</li>
      <li>But as far as hair, it seems like it can handle most anything, even a lot of hair.</li>
      <li>One was D.O.A., but it wasn&#x27;t worth returning it.</li>
      <li>This product did not work right out of the box.</li>
      <li>I cut my own hair and my husbands hair and use this little gem to clean up the eyebrows and ear hair.  </li>
      <li>I paid $10.00 for my first two</li>
      <li>The product worked once when I first received it.  </li>
      <li>I really resent having to travel to the UPS store to return an item that I  never ordered in the first place.  </li>
      <li>Its ok, but doesnt hold a charge for long, nor does it shave that well.</li>
      <li>It is an OK product,I think it was worth less money.  </li>
      <li>and I think it peforms very well.  </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s really all we use it for.  </li>
      <li>and it works very well, cropping the hairs close without getting a burn or irritation.  </li>
      <li>And it does not cut really close (like a normal razor)</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
      <li>They say it works great on facial hair, but seriously, I would NOT use it on my face.  </li>
      <li>It is much better than using depilatory creams which can be harsh on the skin.  </li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t tend to think of it as something I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
      <li>I put new batteries in it and it wont work.</li>
      <li>Live and learn is my motto now.</li>
      <li>I got another from my sister with new batteries and it wont work.</li>
      <li>About a month ago I ordered a new one and with new batteries, it wont work.  </li>
      <li>The retailer responded promptly however, to replace it with a new improved version.</li>
      <li>I actually recieved the Finishing Touch with the light in it, even though I ordered the regular one.</li>
      <li>Its very fast and simple to use.</li>
      <li>The finishing touch pro is a geat little compact trimmer, i paid only $4.99 for mine and liked it so much I bought an extra one and wouldn&#x27;t take $20.00 for them.  </li>
      <li>The only thing that would make it better is if it had a small mirror with it, otherwise, you can&#x27;t really improve on perfection.</li>
      <li>Will definitely continue to use as its SO much better than using Nair which left me dry, scaly and almost burned feeling.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic price for this little hair trimmer.  </li>
      <li>your system required that I put one in to complete</li>
      <li>BTW its gentle enough to use on your nosehair.</li>
      <li>I have used it on several parts of my body to remove hair from my face and eyebrows, to my arms and legs, to more delicate parts.</li>
      <li>I purchased one for myself several years ago and use it frequently.  </li>
      <li>The only down side is that the light does not shine right where the blade is, so you can&#x27;t really see were you are cutting</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I received my Finishing Touch Razor last week. Was suppose to get a free compact mirror with the purchase as advertised which was NOT in the box, also the light did not work. Called the company several times, got a different answer each time. Still have the broken razor, out $23.00. Live and learn is my motto now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Remington shaver and a Venus shaver that is specialized for just women, and I keep going back to this one. It is, by far, the best hair removal tool on the market. Not only is the speed more than impressive, but the blades are put together in a way that it is not easy to get cut, nicked, or injured in anyway. This thing is durable, easy to clean (after multiple uses), and incredibly comfortable to use anywhere on your body. I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really resent having to travel to the UPS store to return an item that I  never ordered in the first place.  Why can&#x27;t you just ship ONLY the items  ordered?  I also would like to know why I&#x27;m not getting a full refund of  $32.99.</li>
    <li> the item description says it \\&quot;erases the hair\\&quot; with its special \\&quot;micro-technology.\\&quot;  Basically, it is just a tiny electric shaver that works on batteries.  They say it works great on facial hair, but seriously, I would NOT use it on my face.  It would be a decent product if they didn&#x27;t falsely advertise.</li>
    <li> I use it whenever I need to shape my eyebrows and I don&#x27;t feel like tweezing or waxing.  Its very fast and simple to use.</li>
    <li> Just bought one, works fine, good accessories...and ony $15....if it keeps working for a year then I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars.  Every haricut is about $20 so this is a great way to trim aroudn ears in between the cuts.  BTW its gentle enough to use on your nosehair.</li>
    <li> But then, short of electrolysis, I guess nothing is.  It worked ok.  But I don&#x27;t tend to think of it as something I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
    <li> I owned 1 of these years ago and liked it. I put new batteries in it and it wont work. I got another from my sister with new batteries and it wont work. About a month ago I ordered a new one and with new batteries, it wont work.  I dont want to spend the postage to send them all back if I wont get a reply. Hope you can do something</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these little shavers for about a year and I think it peforms very well.  I didn&#x27;t expect to get razor smooth skin, that&#x27;s not what I wanted anyway...I use it on my face and feet, whereever there may be extra hair that&#x27;s not wanted and it works very well, cropping the hairs close without getting a burn or irritation.  I guess if you have dark hair (I have blond), it might still show, but still, for what it&#x27;s advertised for, I think it delivers...I&#x27;m buying a 2nd one for travel.</li>
    <li> It is an OK product,I think it was worth less money.  I thoughtit was going to be differant than others,   that are sold at $10.95.</li>
    <li> This is a terrific product.  I purchased one for myself several years ago and use it frequently.  It is much better than using depilatory creams which can be harsh on the skin.  This year I bought several to give as gifts.  They are great for the elderly to use.</li>
    <li> I have had this product before but this new one is improved and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This product did not work right out of the box. Yes, would not turn on. Is flimsy and looks like others have had this problem too. The retailer responded promptly however, to replace it with a new improved version.</li>
    <li> I actually recieved the Finishing Touch with the light in it, even though I ordered the regular one. But that was fine with me! I LOVE IT! The only down side is that the light does not shine right where the blade is, so you can&#x27;t really see were you are cutting, just were you have already cut. And it does not cut really close (like a normal razor) But it gets the job done!  I would recommend this product to anybody! Very nice!</li>
    <li> The product worked once when I first received it.  The next time I tried to use it, it no longer worked.  I checked and replaced the battery, but it simply didn&#x27;t work.  The cost and trouble to return it (and I don&#x27;t have the the address) is more than the product is worth, but I sure won&#x27;t buy or do business with this company again! zero stars actual rating - your system required that I put one in to complete</li>
    <li> I changed many batteries and fiddled and fiddled, but it won&#x27;t work.  It was a gift and cannot be returned.  They offer no support or replacement options.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this trimmer for a few years.  My spouse &amp; I both love it.  The attachment is perfect for eyebrows.  It&#x27;s also great for trimming wayward ear hairs.  That&#x27;s really all we use it for.  I only recently finally changed the battery because it sounded like the motor was slowing.  It&#x27;s been reliable &amp; is well made.  Since it&#x27;s about the size of a tube of mascara, it&#x27;s easy to take on trips or even slip in a purse.  The trimmer &amp; attachment both fit in the handy travel pouch.  Love it!</li>
    <li> After only a few uses, my trimmer simply stopped working! No, it wasn&#x27;t the batteries. And I was not within the allotted time frame for returning the defective item, so I am simply \\&quot;out\\&quot; my money and I am not happy about it! I should be able to receive some kind of compensation for my time and money.</li>
    <li> The light on it is great. The sellers are wonderful and quick to send product. The description does not even tell how Wonderful this product is.  I would deal with this seller again. No problems.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for such a product. This one will do a good job for not too much money. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I would NEVER NEVER NEVER purchase a product from IDEA VILLAGE. They are criminals! I returned some merchandise and they never gave me credit for it saying they never received the returned merchandise which I know for a fact they did! So you better hope your junky product works or you are SOL!  THIEVES! BEWARE! DO NOT buy from them!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic price for this little hair trimmer.  I paid $10.00 for my first two then I got smart and ordered 3 of these on Amazon for less than half of the price.  I cut my own hair and my husbands hair and use this little gem to clean up the eyebrows and ear hair.  Larger units can be  dangerous.  This is not supposed to be a $50 hair cutting kit.  It&#x27;s just supposed to clean you up in between haircuts and keep your neck clean.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the negative reviews.  I&#x27;ve had mine a couple years and its still going, although I think the battery is wearing out. I use it strictly for facial hair removal and it works great.  Will definitely continue to use as its SO much better than using Nair which left me dry, scaly and almost burned feeling.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say anything about the frequency with which this product is bought and doesn&#x27;t work. However, I have had my Finishing Touch for almost a year, and I am happy with it. I am now getting to the point where I turn it on and it takes a while, with my fiddling around with it, for it to turn on (it might be the battery). But as far as hair, it seems like it can handle most anything, even a lot of hair. I have used it on several parts of my body to remove hair from my face and eyebrows, to my arms and legs, to more delicate parts. Most everywhere, it will remove all the hair you need removed. However, the hair does grow back quicker than with anything else out there you could use. Also, I have a hard time pulling it apart to change the battery. On the other hand, it&#x27;s quick, it&#x27;s cheap, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad like Nair, it doesn&#x27;t leave cuts like a razor and it doesn&#x27;t hurt like waxing. All in all, it&#x27;s the best thing I have found to remove hair!</li>
    <li> We ordered two shavers. One was D.O.A., but it wasn&#x27;t worth returning it. The second one was fine, works great and is very gentle on the skin.  They have a new, sturdier version of this out now that I found in CVS - it was a nice improvement.</li>
    <li> This product is not the money. It does not remove the hair as stated by the manufacturer. I had to use my tweezer to get the work done. WORTHLESS.</li>
    <li> The finishing touch pro is a geat little compact trimmer, i paid only $4.99 for mine and liked it so much I bought an extra one and wouldn&#x27;t take $20.00 for them.  They work really great and just keep on working, and it&#x27;s kinda fun too.  Its compact, you can carry it with you and cute too, mine has the jewel cap on it, which is just so attractive.  I carry one in my purse for emergency situations and one in my bathroom for regular use.  The only thing that would make it better is if it had a small mirror with it, otherwise, you can&#x27;t really improve on perfection.</li>
    <li> Its ok, but doesnt hold a charge for long, nor does it shave that well. I don&#x27;t think I would buy this again or recommend it.</li>
