<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Beautiful large warm soft scarf- A must if you missed out on Zara&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> Did not purchase this product. Error</li>
    <li> I like the size and and color pattern on this scarf. Shipping was quite fast. The only drawback is that is sheds on your white cotton clothing. I may have to dry clean it and hopefully that helps.</li>
    <li> Beautiful exactly as appears.  Only downside is tends to have a static charge.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this scarf.  Beautiful.</li>
    <li> Got this as a present for my sister because she saw one at a designer store she liked. She loved this one and couldn&#x27;t tell it wasn&#x27;t from that very same store. Its stylish, good quality and the details are perfect. Its been helping her through the chilly New York Fall. These are only sold by a particular seller and the shipping did take a while. So don&#x27;t expect it tomorrow.</li>
    <li> Decent scarf, but when it arrived it SMELLED!! Will have to get it dry cleaned before I wear it, yuck!!</li>
    <li> This scarf is every bit as large and warm as the picture looks. While it&#x27;s true that the foundation color is black, there is blue, gold, and maroon mixed in as well to match numerous outfits. It&#x27;s also so soft and makes you feel cuddly warm in seconds. I bought this for a friend who LOVED it and when I showed my mom, she squealed that she needed one too because it was so nice.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Love everything about this scarf</li>
    <li> This blanket scarf doubles as a shawl and even a small throw blanket, making it a perfect winter edition. The background is actually black instead of navy and the yellow, blue, red and cream stripes are subtle which I prefer. The scarf is super soft is a very large square and is woven v. knit. I brought it with me to use as a throw at friends&#x27; houses over Christmas and drape it over me at work to stay warm. Love it!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came fast, smelled fine....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More black than navy!</li>
    <li> isn&#x27;t as large as it appears in photo</li>
    <li> It is so beautiful.  Love this scarf.  Awesome purchase for the price</li>
    <li> Beautiful scarf! I wear it everyday in cold DC winters.</li>
    <li> A stylish, warm scarf that goes with anything!  Faster shipping than I thought.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> love it but it is black not navy:(</li>
    <li> I bought this scarf based on the awesome reviews. I agree that&#x27;s a gorgeous scarf but that&#x27;s about it. How can you all stand the shedding? It gets into your eyes, inside your nose and even your ears. It leaves a trail of fibres wherever it&#x27;s been. Including your car seat. I&#x27;ve washed it twice hoping it&#x27;d make a difference. Nope. It still a shedding machine, I started wheezing the last time I wore it. So that was it for me.</li>
    <li> Large, but not flowy, think and like a blanket.</li>
    <li> Perfect plaid shawl or large scarf!</li>
    <li> I kept reading the bad reviews about it shedding and being to thin and how it was more black then navy. Honestly it looks like it does in the picture, it hasn&#x27;t aged yet and the color is a very deep navy color. It&#x27;s really nice and is large. I mean the scarf in the picture is over sized.</li>
    <li> Love, on time and all my friends love it!</li>
    <li> Really nice  scarf wonderful colors .  Yes just wish I had the whole ensemble, especially the purse to go with the outfit .</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift.  she loved it!</li>
    <li> Quality not good; color is definitely black not navy; fuzzy fibers shed a lot.</li>
    <li> Shedds alot, but okay.</li>
    <li> I received the scarf about a week ago and wore it today for the first time.  I love it!!!  When I first took it out of the packaging I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to be this enough to keep me warm, but the colors are exactly what is advertised in the pics.  Once I put it on this morning it kept me neck and chest extremely warm which is great because I am just getting over a cold.  Now it&#x27;s time to go shopping for some clothes to go with this scarf.</li>
    <li> Love this huge scarf! Great price!</li>
    <li> I love it! It came really fast and it exactly what I wanted and ordered :) One happy customer.</li>
    <li> Love it! Warm and soft, love the size, large, but light weight.  Bought one for my daughter; she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Great price for such quality.</li>
    <li> Colors are beautiful, but at the price, I should have known the quality of the fabric just isn&#x27;t there.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very soft, large, warm, and gorgeous. It had a slightly unpleasant odor when I first removed packaging, but it quickly dissipated when I aired it out overnight. I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine...it actually has black as the base color. Not navy blue as it looks in the picture</li>
    <li> I was shocked with how quickly this came based on other comments. It really is a beautiful and warm scarf and I&#x27;m so glad I found it! The label says Zara as well.</li>
    <li> HUUUGGEEE Blanket. I should have paid closer attention to the size&lt;br /&gt;The pattern and color I do like</li>
    <li> This looks just like the photo. It&#x27;s soft, fluffy, warm, and gigantic.  Really a best-buy.  I am going to check back and see if this brand makes more colors because I would buy this in multiples, it&#x27;s so nice.</li>
    <li> very happy with my purchase : )</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed when I missed out on this scarf from Zara last year so when I found this one on Amazon, I jumped at the chance to order it.  Though the initial delivery time was 4 to 6 weeks, I was pleasantly surprised to receive this scarf a little over 2 weeks after I ordered it.  When I opened the package and immediately fell in love.  The quality is fantastic.  This scarf is super soft and cozy.  This is just as big as the &amp;#34;blanket scarf&amp;#34; that I ordered from Zara.  Mine even had Zara tags on it so I&#x27;m not sure if this is extra or what but I&#x27;ll take it.  Cannot wait to style this one for fall.  Definitely recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a versatile, cozy scarf for fall.  These scarves have been all over Instagram and are definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Really nice scarf - mine had the Zara tag in it. Shipping from China takes awhile, but worth the wait. Very soft and large. Lots of ways to style.</li>
    <li> Super fast shipping - way faster than I thought. I get so many compliments on this scarf. It is sooo soft and warm and it goes with so many different outfits. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> this scarf is gorgeous and I received it super fast. Can&#x27;t wait for the weather to get colder so I can wear it!</li>
    <li> This scarf is gorgeous! It&#x27;s been a looooong hard winter for so many of us but I kind of can&#x27;t wait for fall just so I can wear this scarf. It can also double as a small stadium blanket or a shawl. The colors are beautiful, the fabric is thick and warm and the style of it is fabulous! I bought this one and one in another color.</li>
    <li> Looks great and is huge!</li>
    <li> I love this scarf. Very good quality. I have had lots of complements.</li>
    <li> I just received this scarf and it is everything that I hoped it would be.  Beautiful color, soft and HUGE!  Love the look of draping the scarf around my neck.  Can&#x27;t wait to take it to Paris, will wear it alot!</li>
    <li> Not the same pattern as in the picture almost seems like a throw or small blanket not a scarf. Not sure how I will wear it but didn&#x27;t want to deal with shipping back to China  warm but thin material  I like that Pattern of plaid I received. I might see if my mom can alter it down to a scarf</li>
    <li> Love it! Super soft, warm, comfy. Great customer service, too.</li>
    <li> Incredibly soft and gorgeous, LOVE this. Great for airplane rides. So very warm, so very lovely!&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;It sheds black if you wear it before washing it. After you wash it, it doesn&#x27;t shed anymore (but it&#x27;s not as soft either though)</li>
    <li> I thought this thing was going to be huge. But Its the size of a shawl and I can necessarily wrap it around my neck twice like a regular scarf. Just over the shoulders and tucked in my coat.</li>
    <li> This scarf is beautiful, warm, and looks expensive.</li>
    <li> Perfect; just what I was looking for &amp; a great price. Fast delivery too!</li>
    <li> Looks cool and keeps warm.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Okay 3 star ...This blanket scarf doubles as a shawl huge Looks nice and soft and great keep to warm good for use winter edition i love that but it actually has black as the base color. Not navy blue as it looks in the picture then little disappointment !! plus This scarf looses microscopic fibers constantly. They get into your eyes and mouth easy!! But I have confidence liked Amazon Convenient and fast perfect system to handle a polite so love it!</li>
    <li> Very nice blanket scarf, very warm. Looked on Youtube to figure out how to wrap it and now I love it!!</li>
    <li> This scarf is very nice but not the colors listed above.  It&#x27;s black plaid with purple, yellow and green.  Too much of a hassle to try to return.</li>
    <li> Just like the picture, even has the zara tag on the scarf!</li>
    <li> Lovely, super warm and soft.....need patience on shipping but worth it!</li>
    <li> Really chic and on the tartan trend.</li>
    <li> The base color on this scarf is not navy blue; it is black. I guess that comes from it being a knock-off, but otherwise it is a great scarf and I wear it frequently.</li>
    <li> This scarf looses microscopic fibers constantly.  They get into your eyes and mouth and are almost impossible to find and pull out.  I have tries washing it several times and it still sheds fibers.  The colors of the scarf and size are great but I no longer can wear it do to this issue.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the same as the picture(the background is black not blue),  anyway it&#x27;s beautiful, soft and warm</li>
