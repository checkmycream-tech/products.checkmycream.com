### Positive Reviews

      <li>She has started to develop oily/greasy hair/scalp and this shampoo has been the best.</li>
      <li>I still use my prell but this stuff is awesome!</li>
      <li>It does a marvelous job at getting rid of any product build-up and excess oils in my hair.  </li>

      <li>Smells great, clarifies and lathers well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really happy to find it on Amazon</li>
      <li>I was happy with my purchase of this product.</li>
      <li>But until then, it works really good.  </li>
      <li>loved getting 3 bottles</li>
      <li>Otherwise, you do get a good amount of shampoo for the price.</li>
      <li>great shampoo and my favorite color  </li>
      <li>I can no longer find this shampoo in stores and I&#x27;m so glad Amazon is still carrying it!</li>
      <li>Nice product.</li>
      <li>But it makes my hair feel nice.</li>
      <li>It works great to keep my hair clean</li>
      <li>Drama Clean is the best clarifying shampoo on the market right now, in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>Through the years Clairol has consistently produced pure and effective shampoo products and this is one of their best products.  </li>
      <li>My hair was soft and the scent is wonderful light fruity smell.</li>
      <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I read a review saying it cleans better than prell.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this shampoo and can no longer purchase it from stores since Herbal Essence decided to quit manufacturing it.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>and I hope to be able to purchase it from Amazon for years to come.</li>
      <li>What else is better to wake up to in the morning?  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than the $20 per bottle Keratin shampoo I used to buy.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find it in that many stores.</li>
      <li>This gets my hair CLEAN!</li>
      <li>So glad to know I can get it online and remain Drama Clean.  </li>
      <li>I found it on Amazon, thank God, AGAIN :) LOL, and this time, I bought the big bottle</li>
      <li>She loves the way it smells, and I love how well it clean her hair.</li>
      <li>I guess all the sulfate ingredients sometimes don&#x27;t work well with fine, oily hair?  </li>
      <li>Bought this for teens with super healthy hair that can get greasy.  </li>
      <li>The smooth silky lather building up until it can&#x27;t be contained.</li>
      <li>To be honest, I didn&#x27;t expect much, it was just on sale</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this product after seeing a recommendation online for shampoo products for athletes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of shampoos that claim to clean (so-called clarifying shampoos).</li>
      <li>Although it is a &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; shampoo, I&#x27;ve found it works great at cleaning out dirt, dust, grass, and everything else that gets in your hair without drying your hair out like most other clarifying shampoos; and when combined with the same brand of conditioner, it is a great all-around shampoo.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like the way this made my hair feel (kinda dryish) but it did feel nice when lathering, I might just be sensitive to something in here.</li>
      <li>I bought this product (was sent three shampoos, which was sweet) and used it immediately.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo.</li>
      <li>It worked darned good, actually.  </li>
      <li>So I thought that maybe Drama Clean would get my hair so clean and fresh, I could go a couple of days without washing.  </li>
      <li>I think Drama Clean is probably fine for &#x27;normal&#x27; hair, but I have fine hair with oily roots.  </li>
      <li>The smell ever so lightly reaches my nose while the hot steaming water rushes over my chest.  </li>
      <li>I also cowash my hair with the Herbal Essence Long Term Relationship conditioner and I have good results with that product as well.</li>
      <li>I think this has become my new favorite clarifying shampoo.</li>
      <li>Although I don&#x27;t use sulfate shampoos, this was worth the try</li>
      <li>This really gets the grease out, and alll the products like mousse and hairspray, leaving you hair squeeky clean.</li>
      <li>I really adore this Drama Clean label shampoo</li>
      <li>NOt sure it&#x27;s exactly clarifying, but I&#x27;ve been getting no buildup in my hair and it looks great even in humidity.</li>
      <li>I have been using this shampoo for quite some time now, and have been having more and more trouble finding it in stores.</li>
      <li>Plus, the price here for 3 big bottles can&#x27;t be beat, I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
      <li>It cleans really well but doesn&#x27;t strip her hair.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>My hair felt clean but not dry.</li>
      <li>I have very oily hair</li>
      <li>Ready for another onslaught of products.</li>
      <li>I realize that my hair is unusually problematic, but this is just an FYI.</li>
      <li>Pricing on here is about the same as a big super store but the easy availability of ordering it anytime I want with free shipping and 2 day delivery with my Prime membership means I&#x27;ll be back to order it over and</li>
      <li>You know, that &#x27;just clean&#x27; with no residue left behind kind of clean.</li>
      <li>In it&#x27;s place, was some Fructis stuff that had a like colored bottle, and claimed to be CLEAN, but it does not work the same as I began to lose hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great for oily hair, just don&#x27;t use it everyday, it will dry your hair out..</li>
      <li>Which says a lot because usually Herbal Essence is known for their nice smelling products.</li>
      <li>, I say it beats most brands hands down.</li>
      <li>Lately, there are a multitude of ineffective and over-scented shampoo products on the store shelves, so instead of purchasing them, I buy this highly effective, gently scented Clairol shampoo from Amazon.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>This shampoo really cleans and leaves my hair feeling soft and moist.</li>
      <li>Works very well, gets all the crap out of my hair (squeaky clean), cleans my oily scalp and has a great but not overpowering scent.</li>
      <li>I kept using Drama Clean for about 10 days with absolutely no improvement, and then I realized that this shampoo was the problem.  </li>
      <li>Love this clarifying shampoo to alternate with other brands/specialties of shampoo.</li>
      <li>and I noticed that it said that it does not have the same ingredients as the other shampoos - that it is more green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Next order is going to be this one because it&#x27;s sensational and, for some reason, hard to locate.</li>
      <li>It might be the lack of the stuff in other shampoos that keep your looking clean, otherwise.  </li>
      <li>I get this shampoo for my 10 year old daughter.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it daily; just a few times a week, depending on how many days I put mousse in my hair.</li>
      <li>So, with some people, if you usually only wash your hair every other day, this will be fine</li>
      <li>I used to use Prell, but they changed their formula a few years ago and it no longer worked as well, so I hunted around for something else, and found Drama Clean.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone with those same problems.</li>
      <li>None of them liked it, each of our 3 daughters said it left their long hair feeling filmy as well as having their scalps feel oily quicker than usual.</li>
      <li>I decided to give this a try after finding it at a special deal price and thought it would work at least as well as the Suave Clarifying shampoo that our daughters normally use.</li>
      <li>I must have weak hair shafts because almost any shampoo will make my hair fall out around the top of the hairline.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know why, but lately it&#x27;s harder and harder to find H.E.&#x27;s Drama Clean in the stores.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for the old green Prell shampoo but found this in a store first.  </li>
      <li>I read the reviews for this shampoo a while back because I had really oily hair (looked really greasy and just not healthy at all).</li>
      <li>I unfortunately have to wash it almost every night for it to look nice, which is a giant hassle.  </li>
      <li>So I was concerned that this shampoo may strip my natural hair and make it bone dry.</li>
      <li>and I pray to God that Amazon won&#x27;t stop carrying this stuff because it really the only shampoo I can use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can say is that for people who don&#x27;t wash their hair every day, this can pull your hair down and make it look downright \\&quot;grungy\\&quot; on the third day.  </li>

<li> I wear my hair natural and the texture is tightly kinky/curly.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time, and now I&#x27;m finding, like another one of the reviewers, that stores seem to run out and not re-stock for ages.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s getting harder to find this shampoo in stores, which is a shame because it has been the one I&#x27;ve used for about ten years now.</li>
<li> as long as you remember that</li>
<li> A fresh cleaning while rubbing the lather all over my thick dark hair.</li>
<li> I will definitely try this product again or other products under herbal essences.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and can no longer purchase it from stores since Herbal Essence decided to quit manufacturing it.  Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> I know that sulfate is bad for you hair in time it make your hair dry&lt;br /&gt;So if you have curly hair don&#x27;t use this  product</li>
    <li> Great product, but terrible packaging - the shampoo was everywhere when it arrived! Lost a bunch of shampoo and made a mess out of my floor.</li>
    <li> Great for oily hair, just don&#x27;t use it everyday, it will dry your hair out..</li>
    <li> This is my everyday shampoo. I use a &amp;#34;strong hold water-proof&amp;#34; product on my hair. This gets my hair CLEAN! Ready for another onslaught of products.</li>
    <li> loved getting 3 bottles so i don&#x27;t have to order for awhile. great shampoo and my favorite color  green.thanks for taping the lids</li>
    <li> I think Drama Clean is probably fine for &#x27;normal&#x27; hair, but I have fine hair with oily roots.  I unfortunately have to wash it almost every night for it to look nice, which is a giant hassle.  So I thought that maybe Drama Clean would get my hair so clean and fresh, I could go a couple of days without washing.  I used this shampoo 3-4 times and noticed my hair was especially oily and even clumpy each day.  I thought maybe I wasn&#x27;t rinsing thoroughly, so I was careful about this and also used hotter rinse water.  I kept using Drama Clean for about 10 days with absolutely no improvement, and then I realized that this shampoo was the problem.  I guess all the sulfate ingredients sometimes don&#x27;t work well with fine, oily hair?  I realize that my hair is unusually problematic, but this is just an FYI.</li>
    <li> Ok...so I tried this one. I read a review saying it cleans better than prell. I still use my prell but this stuff is awesome! Smells great, clarifies and lathers well. I can&#x27;t find it in that many stores. I don&#x27;t know why. Next order is going to be this one because it&#x27;s sensational and, for some reason, hard to locate. I hope they don&#x27;t change the formula because it cleans so well! Go Herbal Essences! Nice product.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a clarifying shampoo for quite some time. I try not to use any shampoos with sulfates and of course this has sulfates in it. I wear my hair natural and the texture is tightly kinky/curly. So I was concerned that this shampoo may strip my natural hair and make it bone dry. Since I haven&#x27;t used sulfate shampoos in over a year, I prepped my hair by doing a pretreatment consisting of Vatika Enriched Coconut Oil for 30 minutes and then I proceeded to use this product. I was happy with my purchase of this product. My hair felt clean but not dry. My hair was soft and the scent is wonderful light fruity smell. Although I don&#x27;t use sulfate shampoos, this was worth the try and I will use this once a month from now on. I also cowash my hair with the Herbal Essence Long Term Relationship conditioner and I have good results with that product as well.</li>
    <li> What else is better to wake up to in the morning?  A fresh cleaning while rubbing the lather all over my thick dark hair. The smell ever so lightly reaches my nose while the hot steaming water rushes over my chest.  The smooth silky lather building up until it can&#x27;t be contained. Yes, Yes, YES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even use it on my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even I think it is a little weird to use Herbal Essences as a dude.  But it makes my hair feel nice.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews for this shampoo a while back because I had really oily hair (looked really greasy and just not healthy at all). I bought this product (was sent three shampoos, which was sweet) and used it immediately. I have got to say that it helped me a lot with my oily hair. I lost the build up of oil and dirt on my hair. It had a very good scent and I use it a lot. My sister took one shampoo bottle because I recommended it to help her with her hair, and she loves it too. I will definitely try this product again or other products under herbal essences. It&#x27;s a big bottle and it should last you for a while.</li>
    <li> I must have weak hair shafts because almost any shampoo will make my hair fall out around the top of the hairline.  It&#x27;s become so predictable that I cringe before I buy shampoo because I never know which one is going to make my hair fall out in hunks.  Thank God, mercifully, it always grows back, but it&#x27;s a bit frightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in a search to make my hair stop doing that, I tried this one.  To be honest, I didn&#x27;t expect much, it was just on sale and I noticed that it said that it does not have the same ingredients as the other shampoos - that it is more green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried it. And it worked.  It worked darned good, actually.  So I continued to buy it for months and my hair started growing back in and stayed in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, CVS and Walgreens stopped carrying it. In it&#x27;s place, was some Fructis stuff that had a like colored bottle, and claimed to be CLEAN, but it does not work the same as I began to lose hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I found it on Amazon, thank God, AGAIN :) LOL, and this time, I bought the big bottle and I pray to God that Amazon won&#x27;t stop carrying this stuff because it really the only shampoo I can use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can say is that for people who don&#x27;t wash their hair every day, this can pull your hair down and make it look downright \\&quot;grungy\\&quot; on the third day.  It might be the lack of the stuff in other shampoos that keep your looking clean, otherwise.  So, with some people, if you usually only wash your hair every other day, this will be fine - your won&#x27;t forget I can tell you, your hair will look dirty enough to grow a pound of turnips! :)  But until then, it works really good.  It just won&#x27;t be possible for those who shower daily, but only wash their hair once or twice a week.  Your friends will stop hanging out with you.  Your boyfriend will leave you and the Safety Officer at your work will have a very \\&quot;delicately phrased\\&quot; meeting with you.  Your mother will hold your down and scrub your head again like she did when you were 11!! :) :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as long as you remember that, I say it beats most brands hands down.</li>
    <li> I always order herbal essences and never have a problem with their products. They do what they say they are going to do and I end up with beautiful hair every day!</li>
    <li> I think this has become my new favorite clarifying shampoo. Works very well, gets all the crap out of my hair (squeaky clean), cleans my oily scalp and has a great but not overpowering scent.</li>
    <li> Got a great price on this with coupon and S&amp;S! Love this clarifying shampoo to alternate with other brands/specialties of shampoo. Has a gender-neutral scent, so my guys like using it too.</li>
    <li> Lately, there are a multitude of ineffective and over-scented shampoo products on the store shelves, so instead of purchasing them, I buy this highly effective, gently scented Clairol shampoo from Amazon. Through the years Clairol has consistently produced pure and effective shampoo products and this is one of their best products.  I really adore this Drama Clean label shampoo and I hope to be able to purchase it from Amazon for years to come.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s getting harder to find this shampoo in stores, which is a shame because it has been the one I&#x27;ve used for about ten years now. Very glad I could stock up on this!</li>
    <li> Cleans oily hair, but the artificial, sweet and noxious smell is hard to tolerate.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why, but lately it&#x27;s harder and harder to find H.E.&#x27;s Drama Clean in the stores.  All the other H.E.s are there, but NOT the green one!  So glad to know I can get it online and remain Drama Clean.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a daily clarifying shampoo - ended up with this. NOt sure it&#x27;s exactly clarifying, but I&#x27;ve been getting no buildup in my hair and it looks great even in humidity. I have curly hair and it&#x27;s fickle - but it loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> This really gets the grease out, and alll the products like mousse and hairspray, leaving you hair squeeky clean. Must use some coditioner after using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> The best, the best, the best!!! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo. I buy it in bulk. It&#x27;s better than the $20 per bottle Keratin shampoo I used to buy. Pricing on here is about the same as a big super store but the easy availability of ordering it anytime I want with free shipping and 2 day delivery with my Prime membership means I&#x27;ll be back to order it over and over.if you have oily hair, this is for YOU!!!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product after seeing a recommendation online for shampoo products for athletes. Although it is a &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; shampoo, I&#x27;ve found it works great at cleaning out dirt, dust, grass, and everything else that gets in your hair without drying your hair out like most other clarifying shampoos; and when combined with the same brand of conditioner, it is a great all-around shampoo.</li>
    <li> I can no longer find this shampoo in stores and I&#x27;m so glad Amazon is still carrying it! It works great to keep my hair clean (I have oily hair). I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the way this made my hair feel (kinda dryish) but it did feel nice when lathering, I might just be sensitive to something in here. Otherwise, you do get a good amount of shampoo for the price.</li>
    <li> Drama Clean is the best clarifying shampoo on the market right now, in my opinion.  It does a marvelous job at getting rid of any product build-up and excess oils in my hair.  I don&#x27;t use it daily; just a few times a week, depending on how many days I put mousse in my hair.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this a try after finding it at a special deal price and thought it would work at least as well as the Suave Clarifying shampoo that our daughters normally use. None of them liked it, each of our 3 daughters said it left their long hair feeling filmy as well as having their scalps feel oily quicker than usual. I tried it and found the same disappointing results for my (long but not thick) hair. Thankfully, my husband says it does okay for his hair, so at least it&#x27;s not going to waste.</li>
    <li> I get this shampoo for my 10 year old daughter. She loves the way it smells, and I love how well it clean her hair. She has started to develop oily/greasy hair/scalp and this shampoo has been the best. It cleans really well but doesn&#x27;t strip her hair. I would highly recommend it to anyone with those same problems. Plus, the price here for 3 big bottles can&#x27;t be beat, I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
    <li> I have been using this and a couple of other products for years.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Bought this for teens with super healthy hair that can get greasy.  I was looking for the old green Prell shampoo but found this in a store first.  This does the job.  I can&#x27;t find it in stores, so I get it here.  Smells great.</li>
    <li> While I expect a clerifying shampoo to be a little harder than other shampoos, I found this to be very harsh on my hair. My hair is actually on the oily side and still I found even using a conditioner along side, my hair felt drier than usual. I also did not enjoy the scent at all. Which says a lot because usually Herbal Essence is known for their nice smelling products. This one is actually rather gross!</li>
    <li> I have very oily hair and I have had a hard time finding a shampoo that can keep it from looking greasy by the end of the day. I used to use Prell, but they changed their formula a few years ago and it no longer worked as well, so I hunted around for something else, and found Drama Clean. I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time, and now I&#x27;m finding, like another one of the reviewers, that stores seem to run out and not re-stock for ages. I&#x27;m really happy to find it on Amazon so I can order enough to keep me supplied for a while.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for quite some time now, and have been having more and more trouble finding it in stores. I then noticed that they had it on amazon for cheaper than what I would have paid at the store, so it was definitely a win-win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the shampoo, it leaves your hair with that feeling of cleanliness that not many other shampoos do. You know, that &#x27;just clean&#x27; with no residue left behind kind of clean. Awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of shampoos that claim to clean (so-called clarifying shampoos). This shampoo really cleans and leaves my hair feeling soft and moist. If you have an oily scalp, this product is the way to go. It&#x27;s sad that I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore though.</li>
