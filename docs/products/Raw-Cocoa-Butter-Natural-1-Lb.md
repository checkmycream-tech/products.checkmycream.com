<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it! There&#x27;s none better!</li>
    <li> Great product, great container. Well, maybe I shouldn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; container as it&#x27;s a pain to open. If you have a paint can opening then that works great. But I say great container as it&#x27;s a great way to store cocoa butter. I like that I can take chunks out to add to my lotion and I don&#x27;t have to cut chunks from a brick. Very easy to use, great quality.</li>
    <li> This product came in one big solid bar. It was easy to cut and melt and smelled like chocolate. I used it to make a whipped body lotion. Worked well</li>
    <li> Smells like Chocolate (as it&#x27;s supposed to).  Perfect for the different soaps I make and yes I do concoct many different types with different ingredients.</li>
    <li> Did not come on the bucket shown, container is not sealed air tight.</li>
    <li> It was my first time to order at amazon and I am satisfied for all the stuff I ordered specially the cocoa butter smell so good</li>
    <li> I can not say it enough, Raw cocoa butter is the best thing for you skin. Its all natural and it clears up dark spots and heals better than any other product on the market. Lotions, creams and other skin products are watered down with chemicals and other junk and all claim to clear up skin, make soft, glowing etc. I have gotten rid of all other products and just use cocoa butter on me and my daughter&#x27;s skin. It is absolutely amazing and I would never go back to using that other stuff again!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived as described.  Smells amazing!  When I run out I will reorder more from this supplier.</li>
    <li> Product was so good cant wait to order more it makes my skin so smooth and it somewhat lightens the dark spots on my skin</li>
    <li> Great product and the smell is Awesome ! I will buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> My wife makes her own skin care products for personal use. She always incorporates cocoa butter into the product because it makes her skin so smooth.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t melt as easily as some in hands.</li>
    <li> Big chocolate smell. A little goes a long way when making lotion. I think it should last me for quite a while.</li>
    <li> i bough this to make my own bath scrubs and lotions, but this butter is rock hard!!! It&#x27;s really difficult to work with!</li>
    <li> Great for body butters!</li>
    <li> I use the raw cocoa butter with raw shea butter and oils to make whipped hair and body butter. I love how the cocoa butter makes my skin feel when used raw and I love the smell. I rated 4 starts because the container is very difficult to open.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fresh! I love the wonderful smell and the nice melting point. I used it for making lip balms but will use it in cooking.</li>
    <li> smells delicious! love it! just not sure if I would buy in a one block solid again because it&#x27;s very tough to cut and measure</li>
    <li> I like to use cocoa butter on my skin for the smoothing and blemish reduction benefits and I just started buying raw cocoa butter because I find it to be more affordable than some of the cocoa butter mixes you find in your typical big box retailer (i.e. Palmer&#x27;s).  However, I have to melt it down and blend it with another lotion product to keep the consistency smooth enough to quickly access and apply to my body on a daily basis.  This is the 2nd brand that I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m finding that this brand tends to leave stains in my clothes.  I say it&#x27;s the brand because I didn&#x27;t experience stained clothing in the first brand I purchased.</li>
    <li> This product came in sealed bags and works perfectly for my needs.  You cannot beat raw shea butter for its anti-oxidant properties.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted this so I got it for her, this is not really my thing. I must say I&#x27;m impressed I have really dry skin and this is perfect for me it also does wonders for athlete&#x27;s foot. this will save you some money on lotion and it&#x27;s 9 out of ten times better than what you are buying off of the shelf. I use the lotions my wife makes more than she does.</li>
    <li> We are very happy with our purchase and my wife loves the homemade belly butter I made for her pregnancy.  Very high quality and very pure.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great. I got it as a gift and they loved it, they put it in the bathtub and it melts with the subtle heat of the water moisturizing the skin. My little sister likes to eat it straight out of the bag which hopefully isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
    <li> I love the container! Great product! You should definitely buy it and try it. I will buy it again and again...</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter is so rich and exquisite. It smells so chocolatey. coming from a recovering chocoholic, sometimes i just feel like i can eat myself. I use it in a mix I made for both my hair and body. Great quality product.</li>
    <li> This is so good for making your own lotion, it&#x27;s good for moisture for your skin the only thing the picture look is deceiving it come in a silver bag. But the picture looks like you will get a bucket of cocoa butter. But other then that the product it good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used this in both salves and edible products and love it.  Smells great, tastes great, and melts well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for stretch marks as well as a moisturizer for 2 weeks and have noticed smoother skin and faded stretch marks. A few reviewers have said they have used it for cooking regardless of the fact it says on the container for external use only. Be careful you guys the ingredients aren&#x27;t listed on the container and all though I myself have noticed results on my skin I wouldn&#x27;t use it in my food. Also I noticed it starts to smell bad on your skin after a while.</li>
    <li> fast delivery smells great</li>
    <li> Fantastic. I use this in my whipped Shea butter and it smells just like chocolate! Just great thanks! ~Julie</li>
    <li> I make my own beauty products, for myself and my small business. I needed cocoa butter and the price was right, so I ordered this product. It arrived in good time, and the product was surely secure in the packaging (I had a time getting it open).  Once I got it open, it smelled AMAZING! I&#x27;ve ordered cocoa butter from other sellers, but none smelled as chocolaty as this one.  It was already broken into chunks, so it was easy to measure out what I needed. Melted pretty quickly and the scent remained after melt.  There were no flecks from processing left in the butter.  This is good and pure stuff! Will order again!</li>
    <li> smell was not great. felt a bit too oily.</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter is great.  Smells wonderful.  Easy to work with.  The aroma is intoxicating.  I know I mentioned the aroma twice,  it was that good.  We used it to make our own body butter.</li>
    <li> Use this in my homemade creams</li>
    <li> I made soap with this cocoa butter.  Every time I walk in the room I can smell the wonderful smell of cocoa.</li>
    <li> great product. the price could have been cheaper.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable smell and quality.  I purchased this because when I was in Hawaii the hotel cave us some to nourish our skin and I fell in love and had to order some.  Great for your lips too!</li>
    <li> Very good quality, it smells delicious. Would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Love that chocolate smell. Yummy</li>
    <li> Had a great chocolate smell, worked very well in my lotion bars</li>
    <li> This butter smells sooooooo good.  I loved it from the time I opened the box and smelled that rich cocoa aroma.  It absorbs in the skin really well too.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It lasted me an entire year and I was able to make some great body butters with it. The smell is divine and I&#x27;m on my second 1 Lb tub.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for cooking and for body care. It&#x27;s wonderful in every application I&#x27;ve tried, seriously, I can&#x27;t praise it enough. This easily met all of the expectations I have of the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tastes good, it smells good, it hydrates my skin beautifully, it&#x27;s not perfumey, it grates and melts down easily, and the tub it comes in is hard as F* to open, so little hands aren&#x27;t going to be easily groping around for nibbles.</li>
    <li> I have a rather large surgical scar. As the tissue stiffened I remembered the raw cocoa butter that I used in the 1970&#x27;s.I am glad to say that this cocoa butter is just the same. I apply it daily and have had great results. It even amazed my nurses. Thank You.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this on my skin. It&#x27;s all natural and smells delicious. I have been using it for the past month and have noticed my skin has gotten clearer(in terms of marks and blemishes) and is less dry and alot smoother. I will continue to use in conjunction with 100% all natural coconut oil for continued results.</li>
    <li> I make and sell lotion and creams. I was very nervous having developed a cream everyone was ordering and my supplier ran out of cocoa butter. Makes you very nervous to change your product at all but I had no choice since they would be out for weeks. When I got this I was blown away by the quality. Not only is the smell wonderful but the color as well. I had no problems melting it at all. In the end the only loser in this situation was my old supplier because I found a new supplier of cocoa butter now :-) My customers raved about the smell.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It is rich and creamy and mixes well with shea butter.  Hope you love it as much as I do.  Love the smell!!  Great product</li>
    <li> Just as described. Worked great. Really good seal on bucket that is hard to open.</li>
    <li> smells soooooo good. I kinda want to eat it. but it says not to.</li>
    <li> I received this today. I am making lip balm and hand lotion. Besides having to pry open the container with a spoon and get it back on with a hammer I love this product. It works great with whatever you need.</li>
    <li> I have ordered Cocoa butter from other companies, and they do not measure up to this one. I am very well pleased, and will order from this company for now on. I appreciate receiving exactly what they described.</li>
    <li> Okay it is shipped in a nice sealed container and arrived on time. When opened you&#x27;re hit with a strong sensual chocolate aroma (goodies). There are various oblong shaped yellow pods in the tube and they are hard (no prob I just finely chopped some up) but that didn&#x27;t stop me from putting it in the blender with my raw butter and making my body budda, lol. ; )</li>
    <li> I purchased several brands of raw cocoa butter and this is my favorite for several reasons. First, the bucket... it creates an airtight seal which can be pried off with a big coin, or in my case, a big flat-head screwdriver. The smell is absolutely wonderful. There were no pieces of weird stuff in it as I&#x27;ve seen in other brands. I&#x27;ve used this in my lotion bars, mixed with essential oils and other carrier oils, such as coconut or shea. It melts well in a double boiler. Since this is unrefined, it&#x27;s going to smell like chocolate. This can be great if you like chocolate, but a challenge if you want to add essential oils. I experiment by holding a piece of it up to my nose while holding a bottle of essential oil beside it to see if they will compliment each other. I&#x27;ve been surprised by a few EO&#x27;s that actually blend well with this.</li>
    <li> a little over priced, but decent product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> My cocoa butter smell so good omg I melt it put it  in my lotion my skin feel so soft 😍</li>
    <li> When included in my products, customers have mentioned noticing a major difference in texture and quality. I plan on placing future orders.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff.  Lasts me a good while too.</li>
    <li> Great product...pure &amp; simple</li>
    <li> The butter is rich and fragrant.</li>
    <li> kinda chalky but otherwise great!</li>
    <li> Product seems to be good. Comparable to other raw cocoa butters that I have used as moisturizers.  I was disappointed that it did not arrive as pictured. It was not in chunks or in a resealable container. It came as a solid, 1 lb block of butter in a resealable, white bag which makes it more difficult to break up and work with. Company should update photo and description so customers don&#x27;t think they are getting smaller bits of butter in reuseable containers.  Otherwise, pleased with the quality so far.</li>
    <li> love the smell and the quality of cocoa butter; starts to melt in your hand as your holding it; so far just melting it for a few seconds in the microwave then applying it on my wet face; would like to try whipping it and mixing w/different oils</li>
