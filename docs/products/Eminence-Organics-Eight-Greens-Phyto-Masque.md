      <li>[ It smells great though.</li>
      <li>, so it feels very nice.</li>
      <li>After I removed it with a warm washcloth and rinsed with warm water, I did have the sun burned look on my face, but after an hour or so and applying a moisture serum my skin looks and feels GREAT!</li>
      <li>Makes skin feel so good.  </li>
      <li>This is good stuff.  </li>

      <li>It has a nice plant like scent.</li>
      <li>, I didn&#x27;t see those results but my skin liked the moisture that it provided.</li>

      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This is magic for aging, acne-prone skin.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product and I will buy more Eminence products.</li>
      <li>This was okay.  </li>
      <li>but I am happy to report that I can feel and see that using the masque on a weekly basis as suggested has caused a reduction in the subcutaneous cysts that caused so much embarrassment and pain.  </li>
      <li>I am beginning to love all their products.</li>
      <li>I am very excited about the Eminence skin care line.</li>
      <li>This product is pretty good.</li>
      <li>Eminence is a Hungarian beauty line available mostly in spas.  </li>
      <li>It is seriously the best skin care out there, and healthy too!</li>
      <li>this would look help tremendously!</li>
      <li>a lot of the reviews on here sound like they are for the \\&quot;HOT\\&quot; version of this masque.  </li>
      <li>are much more useful.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin look clear and bright.</li>
      <li>After gently exfoliating the masque away with a warm washcloth my skin started to feel cool again and just...refreshed.</li>
      <li>I did not notice anything special with the product.  </li>
      <li>It has a fresh smooth feel once you have washed it off.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product but it shouldn&#x27;t be marketed for people who have acne.</li>
      <li>I was sooo excited to try this product being a licensed esthetician who prefers more organic and natural products...</li>
      <li>once I wash it off, my skin feels very soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>Let me start off first by saying that 3 months ago I stopped wearing ANY makeup!</li>
      <li>This product is so safe and natural, you could eat it.</li>
      <li>This mask is well worth the money.  </li>
      <li>It does have some hotness to this due to paprika, which suppose to be good for the skin.  </li>
      <li>I preffer the lime stimulating hot masque.. you won&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
      <li>Just received my phyto masque today and tried it out first thing.</li>
      <li>I put this mask on when I feel like my skin needs some extra love and nutrients.</li>
      <li>I love this entire product line of organic skin care.  </li>
      <li>When it says HOT it means a hot that is temporary like a sunburn for a couple of hours</li>
      <li>I was going to go to the spa to get a facial, but now I don&#x27;t have to any more.</li>
      <li>After removing that I then applied the Eminence mask and believe me you DONT NEED THAT MUCH!</li>
      <li>After I rinsed it off, my skin looked fabulously fresh and lines nearly invisible.</li>
      <li>Be sure to buy  Pear &amp; Poppy Seed Microderm Polisher and use this afterwards.....or other Eminence masque.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Nothing great about it, or wrong.  </li>
      <li>but this is normal.</li>
      <li>My skin also feels very soft before even putting moisturizer on.</li>
      <li>I was horrified until I had a facial and was introduced to the Eight Greens Phyto Masque - HOT.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin &amp; suffer from adult acne.  </li>
      <li>Made me wonder if this is an old product.</li>
      <li>(I have terribly sensitive skin).</li>
      <li>It makes your skin really soft.</li>
      <li>major blemishes were looking like they healed significantly and got much smaller, my pores overall my entire face looked smaller, tighter, and brighter.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a fan of this product and would especially recommend it for those who live in humid climates (like the Southeast US) for it&#x27;s detoxifying properties.</li>
      <li>My facial professional go me using it</li>
      <li>I barely feel it</li>
      <li>by the time ten minutes was up my face was red wherever the masque touched-this is normal, as it states on the container.</li>
      <li>The texture and look of the mask are a little less than &amp;#34;elegant,&amp;#34; i.e. I feel like I am putting greens on my face, but I&#x27;m used to it now, and I love this mask&#x27;s results.</li>
      <li>It started to feel warm and slightly tingly, not overly hot or uncomfortable.</li>

<li> Highly recommend using it a few times a week.</li>
<li> Within maybe a half hour of doing chores around the house, the redness completely went away and when i went back to look again there was a noticeable difference.</li>
<li> for my routine: I started with exfoliating with st Ives green tea face scrub, then steamed my face and applied the Origins clear improvement charcoal mask for ten minutes.</li>
<li> I believe that the hot version of this would be beneficial for those with dry and dull complexions as well, as the circulatory effect really helps to rejuvenate and prep the skin for those expensive serums, and buys you time between facials.</li>
<li> I did have some red bumps and recovering white heads and after I used this mask the redness subsided to a point where it was hardly noticeable.</li>
<li> Due to severe skin conditions pre-menopausal and post-menopausal</li>
<li> I have other mask that I feel</li>
<li> Let me also say that I don&#x27;t have problem skin, I only get pimples under extreme, and I mean EXTREME stress and hormones.</li>
<li> Average product</li>
<li> I do tend to have an oily T zone and lots of black heads on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
<li> I use this every other night and my skin is glowing and looking 15 years younger at the least!</li>
<li> Could see my skin turning a bit flushed under the masque as it is a transparent green gel like consistency with little bits of herbs and leaves, etc.</li>
<li> Leaves your skin feeling firm.  </li>
<li> It only takes a small amount to spread a thin mayer over your face.</li>
<li> I have very sensitive skin and was afraid it might irritate but this has not been an issue at all.</li>
<li> It just takes a small amount to cover the face and neck.</li>
<li> Will continue to use every few days!</li>
<li> Try to use this at least twice a week.  </li>
<li> I imagine someone with dull, tired skin</li>
<li> I am very addicted to Eminence Product ever since I worked with it in the past salon I used to work at.</li>
<li> Just a THIN layer!</li>
<li> weird...</li>
<li> however, I was disappointed to see that once I opened the packcage, the seal on the product was broken/undone and the masque appeared as though it has been used so I can&#x27;t even use it.  </li>

    <li> Firms and tightens.  Try to use this at least twice a week.  Can tell a difference.  Have repurchased.</li>
    <li> I put this mask on when I feel like my skin needs some extra love and nutrients. its like a gel, so it feels very nice. once I wash it off, my skin feels very soft and healthy. Gives my skin a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;</li>

    <li> Love this mask. Makes my skin look clear and bright. The texture and look of the mask are a little less than &amp;#34;elegant,&amp;#34; i.e. I feel like I am putting greens on my face, but I&#x27;m used to it now, and I love this mask&#x27;s results.</li>
    <li> I tried a sample and I really liked it so I decided to order it.&lt;br /&gt;However when I applied to my skin it didn&#x27;t feel the same way... weird... I tried to look for the expiration date but I didn&#x27;t find it. Made me wonder if this is an old product.</li>
    <li> This product is so safe and natural, you could eat it. It has a nice plant like scent. It just takes a small amount to cover the face and neck. I left it on for an hour. I had no tingling, burning or redness (I have terribly sensitive skin). After I rinsed it off, my skin looked fabulously fresh and lines nearly invisible. It makes your skin really soft. I was going to go to the spa to get a facial, but now I don&#x27;t have to any more. I am very excited about the Eminence skin care line. Highly recommend.</li>

    <li> This mask is well worth the money.  Leaves your skin feeling firm.  Highly recommend using it a few times a week.</li>
    <li> I did not notice anything special with the product.  I have other mask that I feel are much more useful.</li>
    <li> I love this entire product line of organic skin care.  My facial professional go me using it and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.</li>
    <li> I use this every other night and my skin is glowing and looking 15 years younger at the least!</li>
    <li> I rotate this mask with the Hungarian Herbal Mud Treatment Eminence Masque.  I have sensitive skin &amp; suffer from adult acne.  This masque has helped when I am just keeping my skin under control.  It has a fresh smooth feel once you have washed it off.</li>
    <li> Just received my phyto masque today and tried it out first thing. It only takes a small amount to spread a thin mayer over your face. Left mine on for 10 minutes and felt like i was at the spa getting a treatment. It has a very nice, mild herbal scent. It started to feel warm and slightly tingly, not overly hot or uncomfortable. Could see my skin turning a bit flushed under the masque as it is a transparent green gel like consistency with little bits of herbs and leaves, etc. by the time ten minutes was up my face was red wherever the masque touched-this is normal, as it states on the container. After gently exfoliating the masque away with a warm washcloth my skin started to feel cool again and just...refreshed. My face was still red-looked like a sunburn. Within maybe a half hour of doing chores around the house, the redness completely went away and when i went back to look again there was a noticeable difference. Places where i had recently had major blemishes were looking like they healed significantly and got much smaller, my pores overall my entire face looked smaller, tighter, and brighter. My skin also feels very soft before even putting moisturizer on. Love it. Will continue to use every few days! Now i cannot wait to recieve the serum i ordered from the Eminence line as well! Definitely commend this!</li>
    <li> This is magic for aging, acne-prone skin. It somehow cleans all the gunk out of my pores without drying my skin out at all. Beware-your skin will be red for about 2 hours (from the heat) but this is normal. I have very sensitive skin and was afraid it might irritate but this has not been an issue at all.</li>
    <li> Best skincare product available.</li>
    <li> Love it! I never have problems with eminence products.</li>
    <li> Due to severe skin conditions pre-menopausal and post-menopausal I had what the doctor considered cysts  on my face!  I was horrified until I had a facial and was introduced to the Eight Greens Phyto Masque - HOT.  When it says HOT it means a hot that is temporary like a sunburn for a couple of hours but I am happy to report that I can feel and see that using the masque on a weekly basis as suggested has caused a reduction in the subcutaneous cysts that caused so much embarrassment and pain.  Love it and will continue to use!</li>
    <li> Nina- a lot of the reviews on here sound like they are for the \\&quot;HOT\\&quot; version of this masque.  The \\&quot;NOT HOT\\&quot; version will not give a warming, tingling effect.  However, it does work.  I preffer the lime stimulating hot masque.. you won&#x27;t believe it.  I do, however, like this masque.</li>
    <li> I am very addicted to Eminence Product ever since I worked with it in the past salon I used to work at. It is seriously the best skin care out there, and healthy too!</li>
    <li> Let me start off first by saying that 3 months ago I stopped wearing ANY makeup! That being said, my focus of makeup brands and their coverage and effectiveness shifted to finding a skin care product/routine that would even out, brighten and clarify my skin. Let me also say that I don&#x27;t have problem skin, I only get pimples under extreme, and I mean EXTREME stress and hormones. I do tend to have an oily T zone and lots of black heads on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;Now for my routine: I started with exfoliating with st Ives green tea face scrub, then steamed my face and applied the Origins clear improvement charcoal mask for ten minutes. After removing that I then applied the Eminence mask and believe me you DONT NEED THAT MUCH! Just a THIN layer! I left this on for twenty minutes, it will tingle and you will feel the heat! After I removed it with a warm washcloth and rinsed with warm water, I did have the sun burned look on my face, but after an hour or so and applying a moisture serum my skin looks and feels GREAT! I imagine with more uses over time it will look even better, but it did brighten and my skin has a glow! I imagine someone with dull, tired skin this would look help tremendously! I did have some red bumps and recovering white heads and after I used this mask the redness subsided to a point where it was hardly noticeable. I would recommend this product and I will buy more Eminence products.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good. It is advertised to help aging and acne, I didn&#x27;t see those results but my skin liked the moisture that it provided. It&#x27;s not a bad product but it shouldn&#x27;t be marketed for people who have acne.</li>
    <li> Makes skin feel so good.  Fell in love with it when husband gave me a gift certificate to a spa and they  used it on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff.  After 20 mins of use, it feel like you are washing seaweed.  I only used this once but I am actually looking forward to using this all the time.  It does have some hotness to this due to paprika, which suppose to be good for the skin.  But it&#x27;s nothing that you should worry about.  I barely feel it but it could be different for others.  I am beginning to love all their products. I can see why it&#x27;s getting 5 stars all over this brand.  Be sure to buy  Pear &amp; Poppy Seed Microderm Polisher and use this afterwards.....or other Eminence masque.</li>
    <li> This was okay.  Nothing great about it, or wrong.  Would use it while I would soak in the tub. Average product</li>
