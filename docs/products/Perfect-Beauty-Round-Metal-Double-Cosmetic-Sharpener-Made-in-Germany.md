    <li> Gives you a really good point and does not eat up your pencil. Good product.</li>
    <li> This is the highest quality and sharpens well. There are two sizes, small and large. Because the blades are so sharp, be careful if you store this in your makeup bag. I reached in once and it cut my finger.</li>
    <li> This sharpener works EXCELLENT!</li>
    <li> I bought a great lip pencil in a nude so clear you can&#x27;t see it, but it holds like crazy. However, when it wore down I found to my horror that the black casing around the pencil wouldn&#x27;t be sharpened by any sharpener I owned. It even broke an exacting knife!! This sharpener had the thing to a sharp point so I could draw my baby now in 30 secs! No Lie! If I could love a sharpener, this would be it!!!</li>
    <li> Great. Its so sturdy that it sharpens even the thickest plastic material. I will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly to sharpen eyebrow pencils and one does not have to freeze pencil before trying to sharpen it! Price was fantastic for something one uses almost daily!  Worth every penny!</li>

    <li> Works as described.  Very sturdy. Don&#x27;t have to worry about dropping and breaking as it is metal.</li>
    <li> A great sharpener. It keeps all my eyeliners sharpened to a fine point. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> Works well for some pencils, not all.  But glad to have it.  Thank you.</li>

    <li> Best cosmetic sharpener I&#x27;ve ever had.  Cuts through wood and the newer harder plastic material that so many products come in now.  Buy several and share.</li>
