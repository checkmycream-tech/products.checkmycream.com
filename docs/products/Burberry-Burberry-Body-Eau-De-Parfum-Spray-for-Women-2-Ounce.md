      <li>It has a wonderful, soft scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and just smells so good.</li>

      <li>I love this perfume.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I would describe it as gentle and feminine; a great perfume for any age :).</li>
      <li>so it was like free money!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t speak for longevity of wear yet, but I&#x27;m almost 100% sure</li>
      <li>I was pleased with the price.</li>
      <li>Wanting to get more bang for my buck</li>
      <li>scent itself is warm and floral--not at all powdery or musky, and not too sweet.</li>
      <li>Just as strong as the one in the stores that are so much more.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t care for strong, floral scents, so was pleased when this Burberry came out.  </li>
      <li>I loved it so much</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and in a safe package which prevented breakage.</li>
      <li>Burberry sent me samples, this is a light but substantial fragrance.</li>
      <li>The scent is mild, clean and stays on all day!  </li>
      <li>I liked it more because i smelled it earlier, so make sure you are familiar with it</li>
      <li>my new favorite fragrance!</li>
      <li>I was expecting a much smaller bottle when I ordered this, but the size is amazing for the cost!</li>
      <li>I love the fresh citrus notes and how fresh it smells and</li>
      <li>It came fairly quickly and I immediately opened it and put on a spritz, with my sample and at the department store one spritz was plenty and lasted all day... within about 20 minutes</li>
      <li>Burberry body parfum is my new favorite fragrance.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and the fact that it is not overwhelming, very happy with my purchase and would definitely purchase it again.</li>
      <li>The alcohol smell was very strong in the first spray which is where the top notes should be strongest and the smell throughout the say turned sour unlike the original bottle I had gotten.</li>
      <li>but I put on twice as much perfume now and the scent fades quickly....</li>
      <li>But the scent is the same, lovely.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite and at a terrific price.</li>
      <li>It last all day I have received so many compliments.</li>
      <li>I ordered this from amazon instead of getting it from Nordstorm or Sephora, in which I had gotten my first one from Sephora.</li>
      <li>but is not nearly as nice or great smelling as the real</li>
      <li>The item was exactly as described, new, in the box, and unwrapped!!</li>
      <li>I switched from D&amp;G Light Blue to this as my staple.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>this is the authentic eau de parfum; even on the verry remote off-chance that it was a re-branded EDT, it&#x27;s still a steal for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I came to Amazon to see how much my perfume was... $46 for a 2oz bottle as opposed to $90 at the department store...</li>
      <li>Very sneaky.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>It was the same potency of the original bottle I had.</li>
      <li>Its very new scent.</li>
      <li>I found this on Amazon and thought wow this is a pretty decent price.</li>
      <li>If it had a little more longevity I would have rated it a 5.</li>
      <li>Looked new.</li>
      <li>The product was new.</li>
      <li>I opened it and sure enough it&#x27;s the same packaging and bottle and smells SIMILAR</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m more partial to Burberry London, but Body is a lighter, less intense fragrance that still has decent staying power.</li>
      <li>compared my sample of Burberry Body (you can request spray samples at places like Sephora) to the 2 oz version I purchased directly from Amazon, and could not distinguish any difference in aroma.</li>
      <li>Burberry Body is BY FAR</li>
      <li>, HOWEVER I looked closer to find that the plastic wrap was ONLY sealed at the top, someone had cut a very small portion of the bottom seal and taped it to the packaging.</li>
      <li>The scent is very likeable but does not last very long.  </li>
      <li>It does not last as long as the real thing, and I found that after the initial spray, the scent seems to change on my skin/clothes (or what I can barely smell of</li>
      <li>I read the reviews and it seemed that some of the other people who bought this seemed to think it was either identical or very close to the ones found in department stores but DON&#x27;T BE FOOLED.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I actually use to work in fragrances for a short period of time and this bottle smelled like it was old or a knock off.</li>

    <li> This is my favorite and at a terrific price. Just as strong as the one in the stores that are so much more.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent!  The scent is mild, clean and stays on all day!  I also love the bottle and the pump is lovely.  Some perfume sprayers squirt instead of mist, however this one is just perfect!  The bottle is absolutely gorgeous</li>
    <li> Great fragrance!  I don&#x27;t care for strong, floral scents, so was pleased when this Burberry came out.  Burberry Body is subtle, but noticed.  I have received many compliments...\\&quot;I love the perfume you are wearing\\&quot;, \\&quot;...it&#x27;s not overpowering, just right.\\&quot;  I definitely recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;This is a great online price.  The seller is prompt...no problems!</li>
    <li> The scent is very likeable but does not last very long.  I probably should have invested in more expensive perfume.</li>
    <li> Burberry Body isn&#x27;t half bad (although the name kind of sucks, in my opinion). I&#x27;m more partial to Burberry London, but Body is a lighter, less intense fragrance that still has decent staying power. Those who prefer milder scents will like it.</li>
    <li> I got a Burberry Body sample and love the scent. It isn&#x27;t heavy and at the same time can be worn during the day/night. I love it!</li>
    <li> I sent this perfume as a gift and it turned out great.  Not only for her but for me as well.  This is a great smelling perfume.</li>
    <li> she has been asking, well hinting to me that she would love this perfume, so i bought it at a great price here and i have no qualms with that.</li>
    <li> Burberry Body is BY FAR my new favorite fragrance! I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 days and have had many compliments on how wonderful I smell. My husband is especially fond of it, and there are not many scents that he likes. It has great staying power too. I highly recommend it! Great price and way better deal than at the department stores, as always!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend got my hooked on Burberry Body when he bought it for me last year. I wore it all the time, but as all good things must come to an end - I ran out. I found this on Amazon and thought wow this is a pretty decent price. I read the reviews and it seemed that some of the other people who bought this seemed to think it was either identical or very close to the ones found in department stores but DON&#x27;T BE FOOLED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine came plastic wrapped and I was immediately happy thinking that this was the real deal and I had gotten a bargain, HOWEVER I looked closer to find that the plastic wrap was ONLY sealed at the top, someone had cut a very small portion of the bottom seal and taped it to the packaging. Very sneaky. I opened it and sure enough it&#x27;s the same packaging and bottle and smells SIMILAR but is not nearly as nice or great smelling as the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not happy with this purchase. It does not last as long as the real thing, and I found that after the initial spray, the scent seems to change on my skin/clothes (or what I can barely smell of it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying from the store next time. For this price, a fake or watered down version is not worth it.</li>
    <li> I was travelling on flight and the air hostess was wearing this scent, everyone in the flight were giving her compliments. I forgot to ask her the brand. Coincidentally I ordered it online,could recollect the scent even after a year. Its very new scent. In the beginning you may feel dizzy or get a head-ache, but its good through out the day. The bottle is surprisingly bigger than expected. The price is also affordable. I liked it more because i smelled it earlier, so make sure you are familiar with it or else you may be misjudging.</li>
    <li> I had no problems with this order.  Delivery as expected.  The product was new. It made a great gift. I was pleased with the price.</li>
    <li> I was a bit dubious about authenticity of these perfumes, considering the steal price and reviews stating they received fakes. On another Burberry perfume, I noticed quite a few reviewers stating that even their direct-from-Amazon (e.g. not 3rd-party) purchases were in fact fakes (or at least, very stale--either way, they didn&#x27;t smell as they should).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared my sample of Burberry Body (you can request spray samples at places like Sephora) to the 2 oz version I purchased directly from Amazon, and could not distinguish any difference in aroma. I can&#x27;t speak for longevity of wear yet, but I&#x27;m almost 100% sure this is the authentic eau de parfum; even on the verry remote off-chance that it was a re-branded EDT, it&#x27;s still a steal for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent itself is warm and floral--not at all powdery or musky, and not too sweet. I would describe it as gentle and feminine; a great perfume for any age :). I bought this as an xmas gift for my 50yo mom, but wouldn&#x27;t mind wearing it myself.</li>
    <li> Burberry sent me samples, this is a light but substantial fragrance. I switched from D&amp;G Light Blue to this as my staple. I love it. Amazon has the best price I have found.</li>
    <li> This Parfum smells incrediable, just happened upon this when I bought some for mom.  Decided to get me one also.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a much smaller bottle when I ordered this, but the size is amazing for the cost! I love it!</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!! I love the smell and the fact that it is not overwhelming, very happy with my purchase and would definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Burberry body parfum is my new favorite fragrance. It last all day I have received so many compliments. The price was great, and the order was received on time. Thanks</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. It&#x27;s light and just smells so good. The price was great. I was not expecting such a big bottle for the price I payed. Great deal.</li>
    <li> I ordered this from amazon instead of getting it from Nordstorm or Sephora, in which I had gotten my first one from Sephora. I loved it so much I figured I could save the trip and some cash by purchasing it online.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle came in the box and wrapped. Looked new. It was the same potency of the original bottle I had. The eau de parfum but it did not smell the same. I actually use to work in fragrances for a short period of time and this bottle smelled like it was old or a knock off. The alcohol smell was very strong in the first spray which is where the top notes should be strongest and the smell throughout the say turned sour unlike the original bottle I had gotten. Still smells alright, but not the same quality. This smells to me like a little like a cheaper version of it and I can&#x27;t wear it because it makes me feel a little nauseous. Will be purchasing from a retail store next time.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells wonderful. The item was exactly as described, new, in the box, and unwrapped!! I recommend it to anyone for themself or as a gift.</li>
    <li> It is just like the one from Sephora. I was skeptical at first because of the price, I paid $38. But the scent is the same, lovely. Love itttttt!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful scented perfume. If it had a little more longevity I would have rated it a 5. It seems to fade a bit sooner than other premium perfumes I have used. I suppose this is better than having it overpowering. My husband loves this fragrance and says it&#x27;s one of his favorites.</li>
    <li> I received a store bought bottle of this and loved it!! It has a wonderful, soft scent. I purchased some online, but it doesn&#x27;t seem as &amp;#34;potent&amp;#34; as the store version. With the store version, people were always commenting on how nice it smelled and asking what it was. However, with the one I purchased online, no one seems to notice anything. Perhaps it&#x27;s just coincidental.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of Burberry Body and immediately loved it. I love the fresh citrus notes and how fresh it smells and how long it lasted, I made my sample last quiet awhile and when it was gone I wanted to cry because no where in my budget is there room to purchase $60-90 perfume! I got my fix by hitting the department stores while at the mall! Well as luck would have it I got a credit back for something on my credit card so it was like free money! Wanting to get more bang for my buck I came to Amazon to see how much my perfume was... $46 for a 2oz bottle as opposed to $90 at the department store... SOLD! I waited anxiously for the bottle to arrive, almost beside my self! It came fairly quickly and I immediately opened it and put on a spritz, with my sample and at the department store one spritz was plenty and lasted all day... within about 20 minutes I could hardly smell it, I don&#x27;t know if the bottle I got on Amazon was stale and that is why the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long but I put on twice as much perfume now and the scent fades quickly.... I think once this bottle is gone I will suck it up and buy a smaller bottle at the dept store...</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It arrived quickly and in a safe package which prevented breakage. The bottle is a good streamlined bottle which is easy to use.</li>
