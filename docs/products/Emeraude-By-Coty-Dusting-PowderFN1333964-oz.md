    <li> Mom loves the fragrance and has been looking for it.  So glad we were able to find it!  So the gift was a success.  She had it in a talc shaking container and likes the puff and this product much better!  Great Product!</li>

    <li> This was a gift for an 83 year old lady who LOVES Emeraude so she was completely happy.</li>

    <li> been using this for years and it is hard to find it in stores.I love the why it smells and reconmend it</li>
    <li> No problems. Great service!</li>
    <li> I have used Emeraude Dusting Powder for 10 years after my first try of Emeraude cologne, after not caring for the fragrance most of my life. I use the powder before bed to promote sweet dreams.    This Emeraude Dusting Powder is the same as the product I buy at a local drugstore, except at the drugstore I have to find a clerk to open the locked counter so I can purchase the product, and the drugstore powder costs $1.50 more than it does at amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I always used dusting powder until I had babies then it was baby powder for us all. Nice to get back to the puff and the great smell of Emeraude!</li>
    <li> My item arrived on time as promised.  I live in Alaska and we sometimes have a problem with ordering and receiving our items on time.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I have the cologne which I have loved since I was very young.  They loved the product, they do wish that the applicator had a loop or handle of some sort.</li>
    <li> I have used this dusting powder for many years. I am not allergic to any of its ingredients.I would recommend this powder to anyone.</li>
    <li> I still have my grandmothers from when she passed in 1986 and did not use it often but when ran out I ordered some.. does not have the same fragrance at all...</li>
    <li> My Grandmother wore this fragrence decades ago.  Not only did it bring back fond memories, I receive many many complements.</li>
    <li> Very pretty.  The fragrance is good. I would recommend to anyone looking for this item. Would buy again when the need arises.</li>
    <li> You very seldom find dusting powder anymore.  I layer the Emeraude Dusting powder with Emeraude Colgone for a light, pleasant all day fragrance -- my co-worker stated &amp;#34;you smell nice, what fragrance are you wearing&amp;#34;.  When someone complements the fragrance you wear that&#x27;s when you know it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> Great bath powder with a wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> This is a standard for femanin beauty. Nothing is like it. Just smell a sample and you will be hooked!</li>
    <li> Love it! Hard to find and thus I bought two 4-ounce containers. The fragrance is flowery, yet fresh and very feminine.</li>
    <li> My mother gave me Emeraude dusting powder when I was about 13.  I was thrilled.  I&#x27;m 60 now and it is still a beautiful smell.</li>
    <li> I have used Emeraude dusting powder for years and love it.  But lately I&#x27;ve been unable to find it in any of the drugstores that used to stock it.  I found it online and was very glad to get it.</li>
    <li> Was reading  a novel and this fragrance was mentioned and since It was time for me to try something new , I thought I would give this one a try.  Though it has been around for awhile I was bowled away with its subtle fragrance and use it after every shower.  Highly recommended for those who are bored with all the new celebrity fragrances and just want a refreshing change.</li>
    <li> My mom has used this powder for many years and loves it. This is one of my gifts to her every Christmas.</li>
    <li> I would prefer to have the shaker type container which I couldn&#x27;t find. This container makes it easy to spill</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a dusting powder and I found this. It is so soft on my skin and smells so wonderful. I have&lt;br /&gt;found a new treasure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this dusting powder in drug stores &amp; paid a lot more.  Not only did I get a good deal but it&#x27;s also the real deal.  No cheap knockoff.  And, much to my delight, they tossed in a few freebies!  I got a few samples of some other products to try.  So if you like getting this kind of stuff then order something, dusting powder or whatever, from this business!!</li>
    <li> It was sent and received in good condition, thanks so much.</li>
    <li> I like this - it&#x27;s a gift. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Mom loves this powder</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this product.  The stores in my area no longer keep it in stock.  I have used this product since I was in high school, longer ago than I care to admit. Now if I could only find emeraude roll-on perfume I would be in 7th heaven.</li>
    <li> I love this powder and gave it to my mom for her yo try and she loved it!</li>
    <li> Not like I remember emerade smelling,not real happy with it,use to be my favorite</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that the size was smaller than I expected for the price.  I bought this same powder at a local store last year for about the same price but was quite larger than this Coty. I probably won&#x27;t get this again and look for dusting powder at our local stores instead.</li>
    <li> THE POWDER ARRIVED PROMPTLY AND PACKAGED VERY WELL .BOTH POWDERS WERE CLEAN AND BRAND NEW. I WOULD CERTAINLY ORDER AGAIN</li>
    <li> Emeraude powder  because my Mom loves it because it makes her smell good after a shower that is the only powder she uses</li>
    <li> no oder to powder.was really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase.  I have been having trouble finding dusting powder and am happy I found a place I can buy it on line.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these for my mom!  Dusting powder isn&#x27;t as easy to find these days.  She is thrilled to find her favorite powder!</li>
    <li> This was a birthday git to my wife.  She has used this product for as long as I can remember.We have only been marired for 62 years.</li>
    <li> As described but difficult to find.  Sent this to a friend who dearly loves the small package and called to say................</li>
    <li> Very nice, soft, feminine, lasting fragrance. I love dusting powder but its not always easy to find. Enjoying Emeraude By Coty</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law likes ONLY this powder and is pleased we were able to find it.  Apparently it&#x27;s the same stuff she is used to and not a cheap imitation.  Thanks, Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this dusting powder. It&#x27;s my favorite and very hard to find locally. I am very happy to have found it on Amazon</li>
    <li> still relevant after all of these years</li>
    <li> I DO LOVE IT AND ITS THE GREATEST, I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS, BUT IS SO HARD TO FIND IN STORES. I HOPE YOU DON&#x27;T DISCONTINUE IT ONLINE. I USE TO USE COTY&#x27;S LEORGAIN PERFUME AND BODY POWDER UNTIL THEY QUIT HAVEING IT. THANK GOODNESS FOR EMERAUDE.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted. My Mom loves it. I am glad to have found it - I had looked in several other stores.</li>
    <li> My mother first gave me Emeraude cologne and dusting powder when I was in high school...that was 50 years ago and it is still the only scent I wear.  I often tell my children that when I am gone...one day they will get a whiff of this scent walking through a mall or down the street and they will be flooded with memories of me.</li>
    <li> have used for 64 years, it&#x27;s hard to fined any where else, very comparable prise</li>
    <li> This powder does not come close to the smell that the emeraude I use to use some years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I hate the smell so bad I put it away so that I could not smell it.</li>
    <li> Emeraude is a tried and true scent.  My mother loves the dusting powder.  I love the cologne.  It&#x27;s wonderful to be able to find Emeraude Dusting Powder on Amazon.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this beautiful scent.</li>
    <li> Since when is this product made out of country ? Was not happy to see that when it came in</li>
    <li> A VERY GOOD OLD STANDBY!!! I REMEMBER THIS SCENT FROM MY TEENS AND IT IS NICE TO BE ABLE TO USE IT AGAIN.</li>
    <li> This is the old standby I get my mom every year for Christmas and Mother&#x27;s Day.  So glad it&#x27;s available.  A little pricey but hey, it&#x27;s for my mom!</li>
    <li> hard to find item.  My father has bought this powder for my mother for 68 years!</li>
    <li> I love emeraude and cannot get in the store anymore.  But, this appears to be possibly out of shelf life, it&#x27;s a bit stale</li>
    <li> My Mothers favorite!!!</li>
    <li> Just like I remember! I wore this in high school, I won&#x27;t tell you what year that was! I adore the fragrance and the memories it brings back!</li>
    <li> Would not have purchased had I known it was made in China!  Don&#x27;t trust the quality and am going to return, country of manufacture should have been disclosed.</li>
    <li> My grandmother wore only three scents- Joy by Jean Patou; Nuit de Noel, Caron perfumes; and Emeraude by Coty. I never imagined finding another powder or perfume by Coty and here it was ! This is going to make her birthday spectacular memory-wise. Arrived well-pkgd. Would buy from again and recommend this vendor. Lyric</li>
    <li> I have worn Emeraude since the 1960s and continue to love it.  The dusting powder is for Summertime use.  I am not exaggerating when I say that I love it.</li>
