<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> SO PRETTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I expected them to be shiny but these look beautiful will defenitely order these again for sure</li>
    <li> a little too heavy to put on fingernails but still cute for something else</li>
    <li> Out of all my nail charms, these are by far my faves! Silver is my color and these have a bling on them as well. Very cute and semi fancy!</li>
    <li> Shipment arrived on time.  Good quality but much bigger than i expected.</li>
    <li> My clients love the shinig bow. Their not to big or to little. The only thing I hate the nail art takes so long</li>
    <li> These are a cute little decoration for your nails. I was worried they&#x27;d be too big but they fit fine on my nails. A few had rhinestones falling out of their settings but I fixed that with a little nail glue and they were fine.</li>
    <li> they are so shiny and totally reusable! they give my nails a very dramatic look and I love it!!! you just have to keep an eye on where you put your hands cause I have a huge habit of sticking mine in my pockets and they will fall off if snagged.</li>
    <li> It says in the description box your supposed to get 10 bows , I got double the amount I got 20 bows ! I was pretty happy with it ! Their heavy metal really sparkly! Will definitely by again!</li>
    <li> I have tiny nail beds so they were a little big, but they are very pretty. Very shiny and easy</li>
    <li> These are exactly the same as the picture. They&#x27;re a little heavier than I had expected, but that&#x27;s because they&#x27;re a sort of metal. Maybe this&#x27;ll make me sound stupid but I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s what &amp;#34;alloy&amp;#34; means. Anyway, they&#x27;re absolutely adorable and they&#x27;ll look super cute any way you use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping didn&#x27;t take too long and they were an amazing price.</li>
    <li> was not as shinny as expected</li>
    <li> No where in the discription does it says TEN BOWS! Smh I was expecting more. But it&#x27;s whatever, I&#x27;ll live.</li>
    <li> Love love love theses</li>
    <li> They are pretty bows but I was supposed to get 20! Not as described. Not pleased. If I only get half of my order I should have only payed have of the money.</li>
    <li> cute cute CUTE. make a statement and draw the eyes, this sparkly gem is a treasure. love it love it love it. simple cute affordable and easy to use</li>
    <li> My nails are smaller than other people&#x27;s so I figured out that what is good for others is not really good for me.&lt;br /&gt;Most nails parts are too big for me, but this one is perfect on my thumb!&lt;br /&gt;So shiny and nicely curved, so it sits on the nails pretty well.</li>
    <li> I love these little bows! They are super cute! My only issue with them is when you are gluing them to the nail, you really have to hold them on for a good 10-15 minutes so they don&#x27;t get loose and fall off -- and it&#x27;s not the glue I&#x27;m using, either.  Either way, I love them!</li>
    <li> so cute I loved these bows. but I have a hard time keeping them on I don&#x27;t know if I am using enough glue or not.</li>
    <li> As an budding nail artist i can say these bows are worth the price so cute! Every nail artist should have these in there collection. I applied to acrylic nails with a bit of super glue and 1 stayed on for 4 days (need to be reapplied with more glue) and the other for 10 days (when I took it off myself)</li>
    <li> These are so cute but they don&#x27;t stay on for longer than a day, even with gel nails :-( Maybe it&#x27;s me...</li>
    <li> Just like every review said the pictures doesnt give the perfect look of these bows. They came 2weeks from estimate date. They are so shiny and just beautiful... I will order from the seller again</li>
    <li> The bows are great. They are a bit heavy but they look look beautiful on and can be used so many different ways. Thank you</li>
    <li> these r very cute but if u dont have acrylic nails they arent for u. i have only used maybe four and i even tried gluing them on but they wont stay longer than maybe a few hours if u dont do absolutely anything all day. they are big for even long nails and they fall off easily.</li>
    <li> love it, the rhinestones. I&#x27;m fascinated, good quality, size. I did a great purchase for my first time i recommended to other :D</li>
    <li> A little hard to use this item for nail art since it does not always stick on the first time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s bling, it&#x27;s shiny, it&#x27;s glittery... what more can you ask for?? It&#x27;s a tad difficult to get to stick so I recommend using either a good nail glue or a quick dry coat to get it to stick. I&#x27;ve been able to wear it for 2 weeks without it falling off... you just have to use the right stuff! ;)</li>
    <li> These bows are to bulky, they stick way off of your finger nails and they do not stay on with any type of glue. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I received my order in the time that was allotted when I purchased. These bows are everything I thought they would be. They are beautiful</li>
    <li> They are very shiny and cute,even though a little big for my nature nails.then i should buy some false nails</li>
    <li> they are basicall straight, there is no curve on them so they don&#x27;t fit to your nail. they don&#x27;t stay on very long either. I have to say, they are pretty though, I will probably use them for something else.</li>
    <li> 5 month ago and i&#x27;m still waiting for it...  Them i saw muy two d&amp;oacute;lars back in my bank statement</li>
    <li> i love these bows, they look amazing on the nail!&lt;br /&gt;i have wore them before and i have had a lot of compliments!</li>
    <li> love these bows, good quality, so pretty! highly recommend for any nail addicts out there. also good value! love love love</li>
    <li> These are flat, gorgeous, shimmy, shine, sparkle and are absolutely breathtaking and so easy to put on, I would order them again for sure!</li>
    <li> I love these. Have no problem with them. I just wish the quantity was higher. If I would have known, I would have ordered more.</li>
    <li> these bows are shinny glittery but very big for naltual nails might work on very long acrylic ones will use them on my cell phone case instead</li>
    <li> The long shipping time was worth it! They&#x27;re gorgeous! The price was good also! I would definitely purchase again if I need more! I use them on my nails and glue them on with nail glue.</li>
    <li> these are so super cute! they are even curved a bit so the fit your nail. the only thing  is they are pretty thick so stick out a little too much for me. but they are super shinny and can be resued.</li>
    <li> really pretty and I love how it sparkles!!! Its bent sliightly to fit the contour of my nail(ring finger) and i really love making my nails pop out more with these!</li>
    <li> Just got these in that mail today, they so cute. The pictures don&#x27;t do them justice, way cuter in person. I will be using these in my next deco den project, maybe a nail design...since that is their main purpose. :D</li>
    <li> Super cute!! But always make sure to super glue on nail so theyll last longer. they get snagged on things very easily.</li>
    <li> This is the most popular charm at my salon. Because it takes about a month to arrive, I place 5 orders at a time every few months. Theyre shinny and fit perfectly on the nails.</li>
    <li> Cute&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for artificial nails&lt;br /&gt;Great value&lt;br /&gt;It took 2 weeks to arrive</li>
    <li> Love it so much looks great and great price will buy again once I run out thank you so much</li>
    <li> I bought these bows to put on my acrylics. They are really cute &amp; surprisingly they never fell off my nails. The rhinestones are really shiny. :)</li>
    <li> I was super impressed with the quality of these bows.. Super shiny and sturdy. Clients love them! Will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> I honestly love these. They&#x27;re very shiny, sturdy, and are a great size to put on your nail (this kind of nail art is best on acrylic/gel, not your natural nail with a coat of polish &amp; for a better stick take a nail file and roughen the back then apply it onto glue/acrylic base). But the only thing I noticed is in the picture they&#x27;re slightly bent, which seems like it would be better to contour a nail, but the ones I received are completely flat while others who bought them say they&#x27;re curved like the ones in the picture, which leaves me to believe what you receive may vary. Like the fact that some people got 10 bows &amp; I got 20. Besides the fact that MINE don&#x27;t  curve on my nail, I still give it 5 stars because it&#x27;ll be perfect to design a phone case or flat surface. Great for the price and speedy shipping, came 3 to 5 weeks early :)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t recall ordering this item the package was in Chinese or some Asian language so was not able to return it since I had ripped the package up.  Have no use for this item</li>
    <li> I love these sparkly little gems! Saving them for a really special occasion. Great quality. Arrived quickly. Over all I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> These are definitely for a night out, it snags on everything. I do love it, I&#x27;m real over the top so definitely fits my personality, but just for that little extra for that night out</li>
    <li> Beyond beautiful, picture definitely does not do any justice to this. They look great in the picture but 100 times better in person. On 3 bows some rhinestones fell off due to shipping i believe but they were in the same bag as the rhinestones so it was a super easy fix just a fair warning. I do not exactly know how to get this to stick for at least 3 days long. Anyone know how just go ahead and let me know in a comment thanks:)</li>
    <li> I love these so much! They came in a week or so and are exactly like the picture. Actually, they look better in person. Super sparkly in the sun or light. I was expecting them to be kind of... cheap. But they are REALLY pretty and I love them! And I have no problem reusing them!!</li>
    <li> All of my girlfriends feel in love with these! They can easily be applied with acrylic or super glue. Beautiful unique touch to your nails or whatever you decide to stick them on.</li>
    <li> Never got them... waste of months waiting for them and money... I really waned them but my hopes ain&#x27;t up anymore</li>
    <li> These bows are extra sparkly. Perfect for just one nail or all ten on a special occassion.I will buy again.</li>
    <li> arrived today awesome</li>
    <li> These are very nice and quite fancy. They are a little on the heavy side, will probably need to apply with glue or with acrylic. Can also use for other projects.</li>
    <li> These are perfect size and very shiny! I could not be happier with them. These bows are a good buy!</li>
    <li> I waited for my product for months. I ordered it in Aug of 2013. it is now May of 2014 and never saw my product. I gave them a star only to be able to post.</li>
    <li> They are cute but when put on nail they are very bulky also they are not.very good sticking on nails</li>
    <li> These crystal bows are pretty, however they&#x27;re large and heavy metal (not plastic). I found they wouldn&#x27;t adhere with clear nailpolish . The bows covered  the entire surface of the nail, and they snagged my hair, clothes , or anything else I touched. These bows are best for crafting NOT nail art.</li>
    <li> I just received these nail bows today I ordered them in the beginning of the month and shipping took a little long but it was worth it !!! They are the perfect size, very well made, and reusable !!! Everyone is complaining that it only comes with ten bows when it says twenty in the name. Well if you read the description it says it comes with 10 bows. And I do not mind that ! They are very sturdy so I can reuse them over and over again !!! Will defiantly be ordering again !!!</li>
    <li> These bows are GORGEOUS! Great quality. The do not discolor and have had them on for 2 weeks and stones stay tight.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at the quality of these bows. They are definitely reusable and durable. The picture does not do the justice as they look much better in person.</li>
    <li> i really liked the size, i have never lost a rhinestone and i used them a lot... good quality and good price.</li>
    <li> Well, the look good but they are pretty heavy. They bows were just the right size. I hope that they work well on my nails..</li>
    <li> Items satisfy description and exactly s picture shows.</li>
    <li> I order these from june 2013. I call several times,,going back an fourth up till now I have not  receive items. Iam totally disgust, several emails were sent to manufacturer,they have not apologise,or offer to help in anyway</li>
    <li> I just received my rhinestone bows in a timely manner. All 20 bows are adorable and look great on my nails! Can&#x27;t beat this price when a nail salon charges so much for nail are</li>
    <li> love how they look, beautiful.!!!!! will look gorgeous under the sun on a nail!!!! if applied on a nail use acrylic not glue</li>
    <li> I have many different types of bows for my clients to choose from but this item here is the most popular... Small cute bling bow I love it and have purchased more than once.</li>
    <li> Ladies, if you LOVE bling like I do, these are for you!! I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect given both prior reviews and price of product, but oy!! I was SO pleasantly surprised!! The bling factor on these is OFF the charts, they are SO sparkly and gorgeous, nice and chunky, and sturdy!! Get these NOW before they&#x27;re gone!! Love love LOVE this product!!!!! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> They got here on time .Loving the bows , they are great just like pictures but even more prettier .</li>
    <li> The picture shows many bows but I received 8 bows instead of 20 that was supposed to be packed.</li>
    <li> These bows are too big and too bulky to attach to my nails with nail polish! They came with a glue which was supposed to help attach them to the nails but I used it and it&#x27;s basically crazy glue!!! It burned my finger the second half of a drop touched my hand. I threw away that glue immediately! Still haven&#x27;t been able to use the bows as it&#x27;s impossible to keep them attached.&lt;br /&gt;Also what exactly does \\&quot;350 buy\\&quot; stand for? At first I thought it was how many came in the bag but nope I only got 10. So it wasn&#x27;t the 350 nor the 20 advertised.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap price and very  pretty, I love it, I will order more soon. My client they will like it too. Thanks !</li>
    <li> Terrible packaging. When they arrived 4 of the stones were off. I had to re-election them and I still had a couple stones missing. Who&#x27;s going to want these on there nails with missing stones.</li>
    <li> These are really pretty, they are flat backed and not curved at all. I put acrylic gel over and around them to fill in spaces and leave them plumb /even / flush/straight on nails.</li>
    <li> I trid not to follow others and buy bows for nailart as I woldn&#x27;t wear them myself, but, I have to say that I like these wee bows a lot. Just having them as an option has made nailart a bit more fun.</li>
    <li> If you have the Owl punch from Stampin Up this is the cutest bowtie for the owl. Dress up those little guys!&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered this item twice and use them often on my Greeting Cards. Think out side the box when looking for a little glitz for your crafts. Shipping takes awhile since they come from overseas but I have felt they do a good job getting them here quickly.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I received these bows.  They were way smaller than the one&#x27;s the nail salon used.  The nail tech used acrylic to apply the other bows; but all I had to use is a drop of glue and did a little adjustment; kept hand flat and blew on the bow to settle the glue.  I have had them on for a few days, now.  No problem.  :)</li>
    <li> these are great yesterday delivered to me I&#x27;m happy because I thought that they had lost or forgot my order because I like saving paper they do is very good. Thanks again missing only black ties me and my order completely believe this hope. thank you very much. so beautiful my client is happy with their ornaments on your nails</li>
    <li> I got all 20 bows! And i love them. They fit nice and are already bent. They make my nails pop. Matter of fact, I&#x27;m wearing them now. I&#x27;m so in love with them. I&#x27;ve only gotten compliments. I did have to use nail glue to put them on, but it works. :)</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY, May 23, 2014 By Grace Verified Purchase (What&#x27;s this?) This review is from: Ladies Beauty Box 10x 3D Clear Alloy Rhinestones Bow Tie Nail Art DIY Decorations (Misc.) Do not buy from this seller!!! I waited over a month, almost 5 weeks or more and still have not received my merchandise!! I contacted them several times and was told to wait 5 more days and I did...nothing. They said to wait another 5 days...which was way beyond their 15-23 day delivery claim! SHAME ON THEM FOR TREATING THEIR CUSTOMERS THIS WAY!!!!!</li>
    <li> Thanks!!!!!! I LOVE LOVE LOVE these little bows. They&#x27;re sooooooooooooo cute and sparkly &amp;#60;3 Everyone thinks they&#x27;re. So cute and always compliment me on my nails.</li>
    <li> Cute but don&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
    <li> Fantastic quality! Came within the expected time frame. I&#x27;m extremely excited to use them. I Would definitely get them again without a doubt!</li>
    <li> when I saw it I was so exited to use it. when I did I did the job. If you are looking for glitter for nail art then this is it.</li>
    <li> What you see is what you get</li>
    <li> The item came very quickly and was a great price.</li>
    <li> These arrived almost a month before the expected date, sure I thought there&#x27;d be a bit more than 10 but they&#x27;re still really good!</li>
    <li> Too small for me,  but they were  beautiful.</li>
    <li> my order arrived the 1st day they said it would, it was supposed to be here from september 27- october 12 and it was here on the 27th, and that was shipped to MS. So it arrived when it was supposed to. The product itself was supprisingly good quality, theyre perfect for nails or any other small project your have in mind.The only thing is the bows are metal they actually have some weight to them,i was expecting something flimsier but im glad they arent and you cannot track your package. Over all its a great product especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh, I love these little bows.  The pictures kind of make them look weird, but they are delicate and pretty in person.  I used them last night and I have gotten so many compliments already!  They are curved to fit your nails which I liked too.  Great purchase overall.</li>
    <li> These bows are ADORABLE. I have gotten tons of compliments on my nails ( I do them myself, I uploaded a picture of my rose design nails with a bow). I love them, they&#x27;re just so cute! They do snag on my scarf and hair, but whatever I like them! They&#x27;ve stayed on for a week so far (I&#x27;m currently wearing them). I initially laid them down with acrylic, but that didn&#x27;t work, so I glued them down with Nailene Ultra Quick Nail Glue (which is incredible btw...that&#x27;s the same glue I used for my nails). Anyway, go buy these bows!!!</li>
    <li> I have found anything made form the Alloy material doesn&#x27;t stick well on nail it slides and take for ever to hold on to I will no longer be purchasing Alloy made materials for nails</li>
    <li> I got 20 cute lil bows and i am in love with them. They are just as expected and rhinestones did not fall at all. Will be ordering more when i need them again. Thankz.!</li>
    <li> These sparkling bow are cute on my nails. I&#x27;ve been getting so many compliments!Thanks a bunch, will order again soon...</li>
    <li> the way these bows are made the edges stick out and catch on everything and i mean everything. try and find the ones that are curved with the nail. but these do look really cute i use the on phone cases lol but not good for nails in my opinion</li>
    <li> bows arrived on time &amp; were packaged nicely. thank you, they&#x27;re just like pictured!</li>
    <li> My clients  loved them</li>
    <li> I love them cant wait to put them on my nails</li>
    <li> I seriously think i received 9 instead of 10 but its fine. No rhinestones were missing from any bows and these are flat, not curved to fit the nail. I secure these with just some clear nail polish and they last for about 3-5 days if I dont get caught on anything.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these bows. They look excellent on the nails and I&#x27;m able to reuse them multiple times. My only complaint is the middle gem will fall off (making the bow ugly and unusable) after 2-3 uses. But for the price, that&#x27;s not really a problem at all.</li>
    <li> I have never gotten the product ! I really needed these and never have shown up I bought other stuff over seas and it showed up 3 weeks ago but these nver have made it ! Not happy about it and want my money back!</li>
    <li> I loved this bow so much. It was awesome and it stayed on for a really long time. I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I love the bows they are so cute and easy to put on☺️</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these bows before I actually got some flat bows instead of curved ones but the seller was quick to fix it and reship me the correct ones, these are perfect from previous experience, they last a long time on a nail if you apply enough nail glue, highly recommend them....too cute</li>
    <li> I LOVE!!! these beautiful little bows. They&#x27;re easy to apply,not too big &amp; not too small,great price,&amp; they bring style and bling to any nail design. Definitely will be buying more!</li>
    <li> The bows would b more useful if they had a slight bend to fit the curvature of the nail bed</li>
    <li> Looks very pretty. I used crazy glue or nail glue to stick them on. Very fancy and gorgeous! They appear big, but aren&#x27;t that big. They look good on.</li>
    <li> These arrived quick and are beautiful. They are the perfect size for natural nails. I would highly recommend them to my friends.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but these are really pretty. Much better in person than in picture. Will definately purchase again. For those that can&#x27;t get them to stay, use a bead of nail acrylic. Glue alone won&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> they were larger than i wanted. the bow was just too big, even for my thumb. it is very cute though. probably incorporate it in hair clips for my daughter</li>
    <li> I really should have bought more of these!  Love using these on my nail art designs!  One tip is to VERY GENTLY bend these a bit to curve on you nail BUR BE VERY GENTLE!  Great quality, great price!!  Love these!</li>
    <li> All I can say is cute &amp; awesome. Haven&#x27;t used them on real nails yet, but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re just as nice.</li>
    <li> A bit big and bulkier than I thought.</li>
    <li> I get compliments from all over...the product comes as described, it takes over a week to arrive but well worth it. you can&#x27;t find these around anywhere where I live which is great because you don&#x27;t see anybody with them. They last on the nail a long time and you can re-use..how awesome is that.</li>
    <li> Ordered one set, they were awesome so I decided to order five more but the second order wasn&#x27;t as great... Rhinestones were falling off and the bows just weren&#x27;t as pretty as the first set that I ordered, how disappointing.</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 cause they&#x27;re huge and the back is flat so they&#x27;re terrible for nails especially small hands. I can !ee it snagging in my hair now. If none of the things I said bother you than you will probably say 5, also they came super early</li>
    <li> I am wearing these now...love them! Nice and sparkly They look great on my nails. I am getting lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> If these bows could have been bent slightly to adhere to the nail better, they would be great.  But they are heavy, have a very small area where they can be attached to the nail, and fall off quickly.</li>
    <li> I love them! I just wish my nails were bigger :( The size of the decal makes it easy for it to get caught in something and chip off</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Product was very nice. Will buy again</li>
    <li> I purchased these months ago &amp; they do not discolor! Love them &amp; love the fact I&#x27;m able to reuse them over &amp; over if applied with acrylic properly.</li>
    <li> So cute and sparkly. Word of warning, they&#x27;re bigger than you might think but still doable for nails.</li>
    <li> They were beautiful to the eye and a smoke on the lips of all my clients! I will continue to buy when I run it.</li>
    <li> I have this item on my nails right now ,I like it ,I will order from u again ((thank u)))I will tell a friend to tell a friend</li>
    <li> I love doing my nails and getting this nail supply make it better both at home n in the nail salon. I love them and also they look cool to.</li>
    <li> Better quality than others I&#x27;ve seen. Stand out a bit from the nail, but look beautiful on my clients. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with your nail art I received. I am in love with the quality and the cost of the nail art. My only concern was the shipping dates...I wanted to pick my shipping date and cost. But your website had it automatically set for 3weeks is there any way u can change that?</li>
    <li> These rhinestones bow tie fit perfect on my nails. They arrived on time and in good condition. They are the perfect art for your nails.</li>
    <li> These little bow-ties are darling, and super shiney rhinestones, tons of compliments and everyone loves them! I will be getting more soon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product five stars, not only bc the quality of the bows are nice, but bc I got my order with-in two weeks. Which was way before the expected date. Thank you and can&#x27;t wait to try them on my nail art! *also good for accessorizing your cell phones* Definitely purchasing from this seller in the future!</li>
    <li> They are the cutest things . My grand daughter is begging me to put some on her nails. I really bought them for me.i love everything that glitters.</li>
    <li> I really cant wait to use these cute little bows. Perfect size plus it has a curve to it on the back side which fits perfectly onto my nail. Great small size</li>
    <li> i really like them good size. i still havent use them but cant wait to try them on they are too cute.</li>
    <li> I thought there would be more that comes in a pack they did look just like the picture but I wish more then six came in the pack</li>
    <li> The item is cute and all. It would be better if it was arched a little bit like some other bows that curve along with your nail.</li>
    <li> All ten bows arrived. There were no rhinestones missing and my package was exactly what I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> I like the rhinestone bow, but it did not curve to fit the nails.  It&#x27;s cute, but I ordered others similar to this  in gold and the bow curved t fit the nail.  I wish the silver bow, did the same.  But this is a good product..  You just have to know how to place the bow on your nails/</li>
    <li> I ordered nail rhinestones for my daughter for Prom, and they never came.  I have waited over a month for this item to come in.  I will never do business with these people again.  Never an e-mail stating that the item was not coming or anything!!</li>
    <li> The bows are super cute. I just went into to a nail salon to put one on each of my ring with a gel coating so they would fall off and they are great. The little diamonds on the bows fall off sometimes but not very quickly or easily so I would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> Beautiful bows. The picture does not do them justice, they are very sparkly and consist of several rhinestones. They work perfect for an evening out or a one night event and are reusable however keeping them glued down is a bit of a problem. Would definitely recommend for special occasions such as prom, formals, or other dressy events.</li>
    <li> So cute and girly, can&#x27;t wait to use them. All you need is a dab of nail glue and your good to go.</li>
    <li> I love the bows but they are too. Big for a finger nail. They don&#x27;t stick easily to the nail they fall of after some time !</li>
    <li> i enjoy the bows alot but wish i hAD MORE but I think you guys need to sell more bigger size/amounts!</li>
    <li> It took a little while to arrive but once it did it meet my expectations!! Very nice, shinny perfect for any nail art/design at a low cost</li>
    <li> These are so much cuter in person. kind of large for my pinky nail but Iove them. Would recommend these</li>
    <li> i LOVE THESE ONES I DID ALL TEN FINGERS AND EVERYONE LOVED IT I TOLD FAMILY WHERE TO PURCHASE THE ITEM.</li>
    <li> It looks just like the picture!</li>
    <li> but too big, I bumped something and they fell off my finger. was a little disappointed.....again they are cute though.</li>
    <li> I GOT MY ORDER AND SOME OF THEM HAD MISSING DIAMONDS IN THEM</li>
    <li> Very cute and sturdy! Can use them more than once. They look more so like plastic on here... Pic does them NO justice! Very happy with them! :)</li>
    <li> too big too thick to wear on nails if they were bendable to fit the curve of the nails it would work much better !!</li>
    <li> They look and feel cheaper in hand then they do online.  They are still cute but not what I had expected.</li>
    <li> cheaper than getting them at the nail salon...love them thanks again!!!!♥♥</li>
    <li> Came as expected, quality is fine. Would order again, although I would like to stay stateside and not have to order internationally. But good job anyway.</li>
    <li> I love the look of the bows, they definetly add some flair and get everyones attention. However, don&#x27;t expect them to last more than a day. They&#x27;re great for an event, but not much more.</li>
    <li> fast shipping love the product the bows look even better in person cant wait to use them in a new nail design I will be order again thank you!</li>
    <li> These are such a rip off for how much I paid for them. They are really pretty but not enough quantity for the cost...</li>
    <li> I made the cutest nail design, charged a couple bucks and they were gone. I NEED SOME MORE of these.</li>
    <li> DONT STICK ON NAILS! DONT BUY</li>
    <li> These small bowties are the cutest little nail jewels I have seen. They are the perfect size for the nail, not too big and not too small. I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> so so cute, its a bit tough trying to get them on at first.. and stay..  its awkward trying to place it and hold it but in the end you get the hang of it and they&#x27;re gorgeous, and with the right glue they stay for a LONG time!</li>
    <li> These are great. Perfect</li>
    <li> great product.....  just as described and i thought they were a bit pricey but they are not cheap quality so i think its good.....</li>
    <li> i am IN LOVE with these bows at first i thought they were a bit much considering im on youtube watching everyone say 1 dollar and 2 dollars but i get so many complimets and love them myself i only put one on each of my index fingers bc im not really into all of the trends rite now (claws,diff color nails exc) i just wanted something cute they came in about 2 weeks i live in bronx ny if that helps and i use nail glue or clear nail polish they stay if u dont bang around to often but i love them deff buy them if you are hesitant</li>
    <li> It was very small and not worth the money! Shipping was slow as expected but the bows are very cute they just look much bigger online!</li>
    <li> Love them I would totally recommend them. The only thing wrong with it that it gets stuck on your hair and that you need glue to secure them really good so they won&#x27;t fall off when your washing your hands but other then that I love them.</li>
    <li> I just got them,they really cute but i&#x27;m missing 1.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate. Buy them. They are exactly like the nail salon ones, just get some strong glue to hold them since they are metal.</li>
    <li> This is the one item that I ordered exoecting it to look really cheap and ugly but to my suprise they were really nice.  However I think I was supposed to get 20 but I only got 10. Where is the rest.</li>
    <li> Who knew these bad boys would be 10x cuter in person. Perfect quilty. But i could only get them on with clear acrylic.</li>
    <li> the little bows are cute and my nails always look better when the bows are on them! they look just like the picture!</li>
    <li> NOT CURVED ENOUGH TO BE PLACED ON NAILS WITHOUT COMING OFF ORR CATCHING ON EVERYTHING</li>
    <li> Absolutly adore these bows! ONLY problem I had is some of the gems on the bows fell off when they arrived; other than that I love them</li>
    <li> The bows are really a bit to large i would have loved them if they were a bit smaller. There nice just to big for me.</li>
    <li> The quality is very good, packaged well and recieved prior to expected delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stones are well imbedded in the product and look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But either I have micro-tiny fingers or these are HUGE!  If you want an accent on ONE (Thumb) Nails, prepare to either have very thick Gel nails or don&#x27;t plan to work with your hands or put them in your pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- but really lovely..... I will be using them for scrapbooking instead of nails.</li>
    <li> I do my nails all the time and these nail bows are perfect.  They are the perfect size and very sparklely, worth the money and waiting time.</li>
    <li> took a while to get here but as advertised havent used them yet lookin forward to it we will see how it goes once I use them will know better the quality over all ok so far</li>
    <li> Pretty but wtf the description says 20 pieces. Only comes with 10 and i doubt they are reuseable ... so disappointed and having a hard time finding a glue that works well with these.</li>
    <li> This is so cute but the packaging sucked. wish it came in something cuter but it&#x27;s okay. Thanks a lot and i will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> but if you slant them on your thumb you will be the envy of all girls everywhere. nothing is more feminine than these bowties. adorable and lovely.</li>
    <li> very pretty. tons of complements wearing them but they come off easy. My suggestion is buy some nail glue (glue on nail glue) and use that it might work better.</li>
</ol>
