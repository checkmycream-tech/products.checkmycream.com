### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The 22 color is perfect for medium skin tones.  </li>
      <li>The ingrediants were just perfect.</li>
      <li>I read about this concealer while searching for the best concealers.  </li>
      <li>I use a brush to apply on areas that need correction, and it blends perfectly into my skin.</li>
      <li>It seems a bit translucent, an opaque-coverage version would be great!</li>
      <li>Uncover up provides the perfect amount of coverage for people who don&#x27;t like to look like they are wearing any makeup.</li>
      <li>The best part is it improves your skin in every way.  </li>
      <li>Cover-up beautifully.  </li>

      <li>Have always loved RMS.</li>

      <li>Love this product!  </li>
      <li>I also love the fact that is has good ingredients.  </li>
      <li>It really is the best I have found.  </li>
      <li>and it was light coverage at best and was hoping for light to medium.</li>
      <li>Excellent packaging and arrived as described, new!</li>
      <li>However, this concealer has been the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
      <li>this is perfect for my not so young skin, that just needs a bit of cover.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s moisturizing and does the job without any nasties.&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
      <li>It does go on smoothly, and it feels good, but it doesn&#x27;t cover that well.  </li>
      <li>Perfect consistency for an undereye concealer; very emollient, light, and smooth, but gives good coverage.</li>
      <li>but I would like it a lot better if it gave better coverage.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Now that it&#x27;s winter, I love it.  </li>

      <li>I absolutely love RMS Beauty makeup. 1</li>
      <li>that said, there are many cons to this concealer:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>It feels healthy to my skin and doesn&#x27;t cause clogging or irritation.  </li>
      <li>Once I&#x27;ve applied it with the powder in the morning, I can touch up with just the coverup throughout the day (but it stays put better when you set it with the powder</li>
      <li>/&gt;Despite its incredible natural look when applied to the skin, I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase the product, even if I never had any scars or breakouts to conceal.</li>
      <li>Great cover-up and a natural beauty product to boot!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years and it is so easy and effortless.  </li>
      <li>the coconut oil makes it smooth and easy to apply with all day coverage.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery also!</li>
      <li>Very excited to try more natural RMS products! :)</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;un cover-up&amp;#34; name is accurate in that you don&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing a concealing product.</li>
      <li>It feels light</li>
      <li>Works well for a light cover-up.</li>
      <li>I used a whole pot of the #11 but love the #22 even more.  </li>
      <li>F.A.B.U.L.O.U.S.  worth every penny!</li>
      <li>This is also the first time in my life I&#x27;m actually ENJOYING playing and experimenting with my makeup.      </li>
      <li>Goes on smooth with good overall coverage.  </li>
      <li>this make-up does what I always wanted make-up to do, what I always believed make-up SHOULD do - it brings out my own natural beauty without creating a mask!  </li>
      <li>When I first saw this I loved the idea of a natural concealer.</li>
      <li>Cool points as well for</li>
      <li>Looking for something more natural, I came back to this and ordered the lighter 22 -- applying it with a synthetic brush (instead of my fingers, which I did last time), it looks flawless.</li>
      <li>This product is everything it claims to be: natural, silky, and perfectly healthy for you as you wear it.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite,  natural concealor that doubles as a foundation.  </li>
      <li>Good product, I use it only as a concealer, not as an all-around foundation.</li>
      <li>but I decided it was worth a try.  </li>
      <li>In my experience they don&#x27;t cover right or blend well</li>
      <li>Sort of greasy and doesn&#x27;t settle in hot, humid weather.</li>
      <li>I initially used it just for my purple-colored under-eye circles, and it works better as a highlighter than a concealer.</li>
      <li>I will most likely purchase again.</li>
      <li>So natural and smooth looking</li>
      <li>This has a very nice moisturizing quality to it - and I like the fact that there are no harmful ingredients for the delicate eye area -</li>
      <li>I have dry skin and this stays on without drying my skin out more or looking patchy.</li>
      <li>this concealer definitely has an oily feel to it and that does transfer to how it looks on your skin but can easily be removed with powder, and</li>
      <li>Would never ever go back to regular foundation, LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>I really like this &amp;#34;un-cover-up&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I really like it</li>
      <li>so I haven&#x27;t felt much need for that).</li>
      <li>Really lightens up the undereye area.</li>
      <li>I LOVE knowing that there are absolutely no toxic ingredients in it.  </li>
      <li>Very compact.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>I am not a huge fan of concealer to be honest.  </li>
      <li>The coverage is very smooth and camouflages blemishes or dark circles astoundingly well for it being such a sheer, soft-feeling formula.  </li>
      <li>I sanitize the product by spraying it with a rubbing or isopropyl alcohol and letting it air-dry, and I do deep clean my brush after every</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this make-up line to anyone.</li>
      <li>Highly, highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>even when set with powder (I use Maybelline&#x27;s Dream Matte), and thus, it looks incredibly natural, and it&#x27;s moisturizing for my dry under-eye circles and fine lines for the colder months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The key is getting the right color.</li>
      <li>Very natural looking.  </li>
      <li>I gave the Un-Cover Up only 4 stars out of 5 because when I first bought this it was fall (and still warm outside), and it felt too heavy</li>
      <li>The steep price tag for a concealer that only works well for my under-eye circles in the colder months is not practical or logical to me.</li>
      <li>It really has a great consistency that blends well &amp; doesn&#x27;t settle in to lines/pores so badly.  </li>
      <li>and I like that it is natural.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for the cold as it stays put, but is the total opposite in warmer months because it melts off.</li>
      <li>it being a completely naturally-formulated product.</li>
      <li>The coconut oil in this concealer as coconut oil is one of the highly comedogenic oils out there, or perhaps there&#x27;s an ingredient the rest of my face doesn&#x27;t like, 2) because it comes in pot form, I&#x27;m constantly dipping into it with a brush (I used the ELF lip brush) and applying it to my skin which creates bacteria and growth, and 3) the concealer is heavy/thick.</li>
      <li>(I also may have been putting it on too heavily when I first got it!)  </li>
      <li>but the price is too much for the average consumer.</li>

<li> I have dry skin that breaks out so in need some coverage.  </li>
<li> Highly recommend this for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to cake on any thick concealer in order to cover blemishes.  </li>
<li> I originally tried 33 and, because it was the wrong color (too dark for my light-medium olive skin), didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
<li> It does cover but be careful when you put foundation on after because it does cake some.</li>
<li> Shade 22 is quite pale but matches my medium skin tone and yellow undertones (I haven&#x27;t tried the other shades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> when I started to use it on my scars and active breakouts, I noticed that my breakouts were getting worse or took longer to go away than when I used my all-around concealer, Maybelline&#x27;s Dark Circle Eraser.</li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> I thought this could be worn alone but found it a little dry on my skin.  </li>
<li> The product feels heavy, but the pigment is light-med and so its really not heavy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have used Cle de Peau for years and switched to this after deciding to detoxify my makeup a bit.  I really like it but it is fairly greasy.  If you have really dry skin you might not find this problematic at all.  For me, it&#x27;s a little greasy to wear alone.  BUT I got the RMS Un Powder and it sets the &amp;#34;Un&amp;#34; Cover-up beautifully.  The combination of the two products is a dream for me.  Once I&#x27;ve applied it with the powder in the morning, I can touch up with just the coverup throughout the day (but it stays put better when you set it with the powder so I haven&#x27;t felt much need for that).</li>
    <li> It feels healthy to my skin and doesn&#x27;t cause clogging or irritation.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> I bought this concealer this past summer and have been using it now strictly for my eye area (lid and under-eye). Shade 22 is quite pale but matches my medium skin tone and yellow undertones (I haven&#x27;t tried the other shades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros are that it never looks cake-y even when set with powder (I use Maybelline&#x27;s Dream Matte), and thus, it looks incredibly natural, and it&#x27;s moisturizing for my dry under-eye circles and fine lines for the colder months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, there are many cons to this concealer:&lt;br /&gt;1) I initially used it just for my purple-colored under-eye circles, and it works better as a highlighter than a concealer. While it does cover up some of the color, my circles still show up from underneath,&lt;br /&gt;2) when I started to use it on my scars and active breakouts, I noticed that my breakouts were getting worse or took longer to go away than when I used my all-around concealer, Maybelline&#x27;s Dark Circle Eraser. I would attest it to three things: 1) The coconut oil in this concealer as coconut oil is one of the highly comedogenic oils out there, or perhaps there&#x27;s an ingredient the rest of my face doesn&#x27;t like, 2) because it comes in pot form, I&#x27;m constantly dipping into it with a brush (I used the ELF lip brush) and applying it to my skin which creates bacteria and growth, and 3) the concealer is heavy/thick. I sanitize the product by spraying it with a rubbing or isopropyl alcohol and letting it air-dry, and I do deep clean my brush after every use,&lt;br /&gt;3) it takes a lot of layering to cover up spots, including my eye circles,&lt;br /&gt;4) this concealer definitely has an oily feel to it and that does transfer to how it looks on your skin but can easily be removed with powder, and&lt;br /&gt;5) it also can be quite heavy for the summer months as I purchased it then, and wherever it was on my face it had melted off even when set with powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite its incredible natural look when applied to the skin, I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase the product, even if I never had any scars or breakouts to conceal. The steep price tag for a concealer that only works well for my under-eye circles in the colder months is not practical or logical to me. It&#x27;s perfect for the cold as it stays put, but is the total opposite in warmer months because it melts off.</li>
    <li> Excellent packaging and arrived as described, new!</li>
    <li> F.A.B.U.L.O.U.S.  worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Had a very hard time using this and it was light coverage at best and was hoping for light to medium. I watched Youtube videos and tried to get it, but couldn&#x27;t soo.... it&#x27;s in the drawer.</li>
    <li> I would have given this 5 stars; however, disappointed that it comes in such small packaging for the cost.  If I use the product every day, I go through a pot about every month, to month-and-a-half.  Other than that, I think it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and it is so easy and effortless.  The best part is it improves your skin in every way.  Would never ever go back to regular foundation, LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Good product, I use it only as a concealer, not as an all-around foundation.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I don&#x27;t wear foundation. I use a brush to apply on areas that need correction, and it blends perfectly into my skin.</li>
    <li> Works well for a light cover-up.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth with good overall coverage.  I like the tiny containers that all the cosmetics come in.  Very compact.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after seeing it promoted on a t.v. show.  It was relatively expensive I thought, but I decided it was worth a try.  It does go on smoothly, and it feels good, but it doesn&#x27;t cover that well.  I won&#x27;t purchase it again and will just stick with my Lancôme product.</li>
    <li> Blended effortlessly but I am allergic. Seeing an allergist to pinpoint which ingredient caused it. I still recommend this product though.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this made my face break out..so I had to return it.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  So natural and smooth looking and you just need a tiny bit!  This small jar will last long and is well worth the price.  I will never wear foundation again.</li>
    <li> I am not a huge fan of concealer to be honest.  In my experience they don&#x27;t cover right or blend well &amp; it ends up looking worse than just being &amp;#34;bare faced&amp;#34;.  However, this concealer has been the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.  It really has a great consistency that blends well &amp; doesn&#x27;t settle in to lines/pores so badly.  Very natural looking.  I also love the fact that is has good ingredients.  I would definitely repurchase this!</li>
    <li> I thought this could be worn alone but found it a little dry on my skin.  It does cover but be careful when you put foundation on after because it does cake some.</li>
    <li> This has a very nice moisturizing quality to it - and I like the fact that there are no harmful ingredients for the delicate eye area - but I would like it a lot better if it gave better coverage. It seems a bit translucent, an opaque-coverage version would be great!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It feels like nothing is on but has great coverage.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, will definitely order again. Quick delivery also!</li>
    <li> When I first saw this I loved the idea of a natural concealer. The ingrediants were just perfect. But when I recieved my package I was very disappointed. This provided me with no coverage whats so ever. It&#x27;s as if it wasn&#x27;t even there. I&#x27;ve tried layering it a few times and still no luck. Now it&#x27;s just sitting in my drawr, untouched.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love RMS Beauty makeup. 1) I LOVE knowing that there are absolutely no toxic ingredients in it.  And 2) I feel like this make-up does what I always wanted make-up to do, what I always believed make-up SHOULD do - it brings out my own natural beauty without creating a mask!  This is also the first time in my life I&#x27;m actually ENJOYING playing and experimenting with my makeup.      I gave the Un-Cover Up only 4 stars out of 5 because when I first bought this it was fall (and still warm outside), and it felt too heavy and I was afraid it was clogging my pores.  So, I put it away to try again in the winter.  Now that it&#x27;s winter, I love it.  (I also may have been putting it on too heavily when I first got it!)  I found that when the temperatures were warmer and I still had a bit of sun, the 33 was closer to my skin tone, but now that it&#x27;s winter and I&#x27;m a bit paler, 22 is a closer match.  The Un-Cover Up, along with the Lip2Cheek blush are giving me a glow my younger friends notice and are envious of!    I highly recommend this make-up line to anyone.</li>
    <li> Have always loved RMS. Uncover up provides the perfect amount of coverage for people who don&#x27;t like to look like they are wearing any makeup.</li>
    <li> This product is everything it claims to be: natural, silky, and perfectly healthy for you as you wear it.  The coverage is very smooth and camouflages blemishes or dark circles astoundingly well for it being such a sheer, soft-feeling formula.  Highly recommend this for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to cake on any thick concealer in order to cover blemishes.  Cool points as well for it being a completely naturally-formulated product.</li>
    <li> Perfect consistency for an undereye concealer; very emollient, light, and smooth, but gives good coverage. Really lightens up the undereye area. Loving this! Very excited to try more natural RMS products! :)</li>
    <li> dreadful. Threw it out. IJ</li>
    <li> this is perfect for my not so young skin, that just needs a bit of cover.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s moisturizing and does the job without any nasties.&lt;br /&gt;great for an everyday unmade up look.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite,  natural concealor that doubles as a foundation.  The 22 color is perfect for medium skin tones.  I used a whole pot of the #11 but love the #22 even more.  I have dry skin that breaks out so in need some coverage.  I use this about every day with or without foundation for more.coverage.  I have dry skin and this stays on without drying my skin out more or looking patchy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Sort of greasy and doesn&#x27;t settle in hot, humid weather.</li>
    <li> I read about this concealer while searching for the best concealers.  It really is the best I have found.  I use it in place of foundation to just cover the blotchy spots and even out my skin tone.  It works great.</li>
    <li> Good product if you have excellent skin. The &amp;#34;un cover-up&amp;#34; name is accurate in that you don&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing a concealing product. It blends into the skin very nicely. The product feels heavy, but the pigment is light-med and so its really not heavy.&lt;br /&gt;I had some break-out issues, and so was thinking the coconut oil may be the culprit, otherwise I do like the product.</li>
    <li> love RMS and her &amp;#34;un&amp;#34; cover up. the coconut oil makes it smooth and easy to apply with all day coverage.</li>
    <li> The key is getting the right color. I originally tried 33 and, because it was the wrong color (too dark for my light-medium olive skin), didn&#x27;t like it. Looking for something more natural, I came back to this and ordered the lighter 22 -- applying it with a synthetic brush (instead of my fingers, which I did last time), it looks flawless. Highly, highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Even though the product feels a bit heavy, I still like it but the price is too much for the average consumer. This is a very small jar of product!</li>
    <li> I really like this &amp;#34;un-cover-up&amp;#34;.  It feels light and I like that it is natural.  I will most likely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great cover-up and a natural beauty product to boot! The color, 22, is prefect for my medium skin tone and helps to cover under eye circles, blemishes and redness.</li>
