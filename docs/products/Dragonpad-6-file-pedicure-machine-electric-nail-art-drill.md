### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>awesome :-)</li>
      <li>Thank you for the very fast shipping, i love it!!!</li>
      <li>Nice for the price gets the job done</li>
      <li>This drimmel is very cheap it doesn&#x27;t run well its very light weight if u drop it</li>
      <li>The top comes off when you turn it on.</li>
      <li>But i guess it&#x27;s ok for the price.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>THEY  BREAK VERY QUICKLY.</li>
      <li>This was cheap</li>
      <li>i am gut here to laugh at the 91% price drop.</li>
      <li>i am rolling on the floor right now.</li>
      <li>The tightness of the internal grip on the bit head could be a little better but for the price, its amazing.</li>
      <li>I have to hold the power wire in a certain position to use.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews except when items or service are exceptional.  </li>
      <li>it was a whole package deal</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really say how to use it.</li>
      <li>lightweight does the job has speed setting fast shipping</li>
      <li>Broken right out if the box never worked !!!!</li>
      <li>I ordered this product directly from Amazon for prime shipping even though it cost a little more to avoid it being shipped from China and taking forever to get here (also in case it didn&#x27;t work, the return process would be easier).</li>
      <li>However, the collet will not tighten completely around the bit, so when you put any pressure on it the bit slides all the way into the drill.&lt;br</li>
      <li>drill&#x27;s motor is very week and not made for long term (i.e. over 5 minutes at time) of use.</li>
      <li>Sadly I thought it was rechargeable, but other than that it works great.</li>
      <li>but if your a licensed professional or a nail tech for a living get a more expensive one that&#x27;s stronger and faster..</li>

<li> Dont waste your money</li>
<li> Not good this a point</li>
<li> but the wire on the bottom is not secure so it will randomly stop working.</li>
<li> It was almost impossible to get the drill in place and after two minutes the entire machine burned out and is totally useless.</li>
<li> I am so sorry I threw the packing infor away as I would return this in a heartbeat.  </li>
<li> unfortunately this item did not work for me.</li>
<li> Will not chance another disappointment.</li>
<li> I literally just received this a week ago and it was the worst 12 dollars I&#x27;ve ever spent!!!!!!</li>
<li> This is an instance where the product was exceptionally BAD!  </li>
<li> very disappointed</li>

    <li> Received it today, it does not work, it won&#x27;t even come on. ...very disappointed</li>
    <li> Thank you for the very fast shipping, i love it!!! Product as said it was. awesome :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M ON MY SECOND ONE OF THESE. THEY  BREAK VERY QUICKLY. THEYRE CHEAPILY MADE AND NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> When i got it the box was open &amp; it looked like it was used before hand. It doesn&#x27;t really say how to use it. But i guess it&#x27;s ok for the price.</li>
    <li> Actually give it a zero !!!! Broken right out if the box never worked !!!!</li>
    <li> The item says and shows in picture that it comes with sanding bands and those were not included, I bought this thinking it was a whole package deal and it&#x27;s just the drill.</li>
    <li> Not good this a point</li>
    <li> Never got to use it .  Product did not work out of package.  Just trashed it rather than going thru hastle and time to return. Will not chance another disappointment.</li>
    <li> POS! I have to hold the power wire in a certain position to use. Dont waste your money</li>
    <li> Had no power, I looked at the instructions, looked at a lot of youtube videos just in case I was doing something unfortunately this item did not work for me. I just kept the bits and used it with another drill.</li>
    <li> i am not going to by this product based on the views. i am gut here to laugh at the 91% price drop. ha ha ha ha ha ha. i am rolling on the floor right now.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product directly from Amazon for prime shipping even though it cost a little more to avoid it being shipped from China and taking forever to get here (also in case it didn&#x27;t work, the return process would be easier). I have a Dremmel in my garage, but wanted something simple to keep upstairs for my nails. So I know how to change out the bits that come with the product and opening and tightening the collet (which is some complaints that other reviewers have had about the bits not fitting). However, the collet will not tighten completely around the bit, so when you put any pressure on it the bit slides all the way into the drill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drill&#x27;s motor is very week and not made for long term (i.e. over 5 minutes at time) of use. It overheats and any resistance on the bit will cause it to stop spinning even thought the motor still hums. So if you are using it to removel gel polish or acrylic nails it isn&#x27;t going to work for you unless you want to do one nail at a time. I sent it back for a refund to Amazon.</li>
    <li> Sadly I thought it was rechargeable, but other than that it works great. I used it a few times and it really works. The tightness of the internal grip on the bit head could be a little better but for the price, its amazing.</li>
    <li> lightweight does the job has speed setting fast shipping i herd someoneeles say they have been using theirs for 6 months.</li>
    <li> I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased.  It was almost impossible to get the drill in place and after two minutes the entire machine burned out and is totally useless. I am so sorry I threw the packing infor away as I would return this in a heartbeat.  I have never had such a piece of junk...EVER!  You get what you pay for....</li>
    <li> After reading reviews I will not be buying! Thx!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews except when items or service are exceptional.  This is an instance where the product was exceptionally BAD!  This was cheap and I got what I paid for.  The filing bit sits loosely inside the little housing without any means (that I could find) of tightening it so when you turn on the motor, the housing spins but the bit does not.  It comes with no instructions so there&#x27;s no way to even try to start figuring it out.  If you are thinking about buying this, think again!</li>
    <li> Nice for the price gets the job done but if your a licensed professional or a nail tech for a living get a more expensive one that&#x27;s stronger and faster..</li>
    <li> It does not work properly. The top comes off when you turn it on.</li>
    <li> I literally just received this a week ago and it was the worst 12 dollars I&#x27;ve ever spent!!!!!! Do not buy this product!!!!</li>
    <li> This drimmel is very cheap it doesn&#x27;t run well its very light weight if u drop it u might break it. I won&#x27;t b ordering it AGAIN. I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I love it but the wire on the bottom is not secure so it will randomly stop working.</li>
