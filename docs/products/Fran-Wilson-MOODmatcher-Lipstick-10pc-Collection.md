      <li>But these lipsticks sure were.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
      <li>I was hoping for more variety in color.</li>
      <li>Love this lipstick.</li>
      <li>THE BEST PART OF MOOD LIPSTICK IS THAT IT APPEARS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ON EACH PERSON.  </li>
      <li>I thought for sure that there would be 1 or 2 that I wouldn&#x27;t wear, but that&#x27;s not the case.  </li>
      <li>Have used this lipstick for too many years to count.  </li>
      <li>I love everything about them...</li>
      <li>I love these lipsticks as the colors are just write for my skintone.  </li>
      <li>Lasts for Many Months, Have Ordered for Years.</li>

      <li>Love &#x27;em.</li>
      <li>love</li>
      <li>Test the colors on the smooth skin of your arm (where it will be covered by clothing, unless you want to explain!)</li>
      <li>They are good colors, but when you need a particular color it would be nice to have a chart.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!!!!</li>
      <li>So these are cool for what they are, but know that they are BRIGHT if you are light skinned and they STAY.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not that consistent, mood wise.  </li>
      <li>and when i came back the color fit me perfectly!</li>
      <li>me (very fair skinned red head)</li>
      <li>They are more like cheap chapsticks than lipstick.</li>
      <li>So glad to find them available on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used these for years and was so glad to find them still available.  </li>
      <li>this is rated ok because i thought it was true to its color not mood matcher lip stick.</li>
      <li>on.&lt;br /&gt;The MoodMatcher set looks like it would give a huge range of colors</li>
      <li>I received 10 lipsticks in 9 colors; I got 2 light blues.  </li>
      <li>Overall happy with my product .</li>
      <li>I like the way it lasts on my lips and goes on creamy smooth.</li>
      <li>Have fun:)</li>
      <li>I apply a light covering and then follow with a lighter shade of another brand, something with a gloss or creme to soften the tone.  </li>
      <li>good old Wilson Mood Matcher lipsticks l used to buy.</li>
      <li>Most of the colors are more vibrant than pastel when applied, so if you don&#x27;t like lipstick with much color, these might not be for you, but I love them!</li>
      <li>These mood marchers make great little gifts, like stocking stuffers, and I love them for myself.</li>
      <li>The item was carefully packaged, arrived promptly - the price was great.  </li>
      <li>None of them are true to color which was the reason i bought them to begin with.</li>
      <li>The darker the color is in the tube the darker or more intense the shade of fuchsia/magenta will be.</li>
      <li>Several years ago, I bought this product from QVC and loved it.  </li>
      <li>I brought this under the impression that the colors was true to color</li>
      <li>Really cool.</li>
      <li>Good price for 10 lipsticks; however, they are all RED...</li>
      <li>Not bad though.</li>
      <li>True I often could use a touch up after eating, but for someone who seems to wear off lipstick quickly, it&#x27;s a winner.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> All look the  same on me... PINK</li>
    <li> Really cool. They are all different shades when they go onto lips.</li>
    <li> I played with them when I first got here maybe I don&#x27;t know the trick to lipsticks maybe its just posted to shadow the lips but I was hoping for it to be more clear with the color but it does completely last a long time and good on the lips makes them feel good and moist.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 10 pack, expecting 10 colors.  I received 10 lipsticks in 9 colors; I got 2 light blues.  All colors turn pink on me (think Pepto Bismol in varying shades) which are not flattering.  The color does last.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Colors all came out pink and washed out. No color difference in them.</li>
    <li> I found out about this lipstick in a magazine, not sure which one now--and bought it even though I was concerned that the reviews were not overwhelmingly positive.  I read all of the reviews and took one of the reviewer&#x27;s advice to apply lightly--and it works great.  I do not find that its all &amp;#34;hot pink&amp;#34;--I have yellow undertones and hot pink doesn&#x27;t work on me, but this lipstick does.  I use a lipstick brush with a light hand, and usually follow up with either gloss or a lip stick/lip pencil/chubby stick. My lips look naturally tinted even when the top layer wears off.  I have used three of them so far, and like the pink (which looks peach) best so far.</li>
    <li> I have used the lipsticks for years.  They stay on all day and I really like the colors.  If you haven&#x27;t tried them, you need to see how beautiful and long lasting they are.</li>
    <li> I have used these lipsticks for years.  I had rather use them than any other on the market.  They are definitely long lasting without that drying effect some of the permanent ones have. I quit using  the permanent ones because they affected my lips negatively.&lt;br /&gt;Love, Love, Love moodmatchers.</li>
    <li> Pretty much all the same color...hot pink!</li>
    <li> They all turn pink, just different versions of pink, and runs in the lips lines.</li>
    <li> These are the only lip colors I use because they are so long lasting and do not dry out my lips.  I use gloss over them to refresh the color.  Love &#x27;em.</li>
    <li> I have used The Fran Wilson lipsticks for years. First I line my lips with a lip liner pencil, then I apply the Moodmatcher lipstick right from the tube.  With a lip brush, I apply a \\&quot;frosty\\&quot; or \\&quot;shimmery\\&quot; soft \\&quot;gold\\&quot; color lipstick over top. The frosted shade softens the color of the MoodMatcher lipstick, that does wear off, but the MoodMatcher color stays..</li>
    <li> The product was above my expectations, but it should be handled with more care as when i got it was half melt</li>
    <li> This lipstick lasts longer than any other I have used, and I have been around a long time!  Pretty intense, and I don&#x27;t want to know what is in them either because I don&#x27;t want to stop using them.  Originally you laugh when applying green or some other crazy color, but it turns shades of mostly pink.  I apply a light covering and then follow with a lighter shade of another brand, something with a gloss or creme to soften the tone.  True I often could use a touch up after eating, but for someone who seems to wear off lipstick quickly, it&#x27;s a winner.  Also, I have very sensitive skin and have never had any problems wearing the colors.</li>
    <li> I, on a whim after late night studying decided to buy BLUE lipstick, that when i found Moodmatchers i payed no attention to the name but because it was blue i bought it. so i put it on a soon as i got it from my school mail room and at first i was pretty pissed it wasn&#x27;t going on blue! it was a purple color but i kept coating then i left it alone and when i came back the color fit me perfectly! I hate lipstick on me my full wide lips make the color super dramatic but this is just beautiful i love it! i still want a blue lipstick but i really love this one :)</li>
    <li> So these are cool for what they are, but know that they are BRIGHT if you are light skinned and they STAY. They are basically a stain, so be ready for that. It takes a minute or so for the real color to set.</li>
    <li> All the lipsticks looked the same, very sheer color. Not what I expected at all.</li>
    <li> I love these lipsticks as the colors are just write for my skintone.  The lipsticks are moist and stay on for a long long time.  The colors are fun, and they give a range of tints of pink and red.  These are better than those higher priced ones as there are more, and the colors last longer on the lips.</li>
    <li> These lipsticks are terrible. They stain your lips. It took 2 days for me to fully remove it. These are a waste of money. DO NOT BUY!!</li>
    <li> This was a gift that my wife specifically requested. She loved it.</li>
    <li> I GAVE THESE TO MY SONS WIFE AND SHE LOVED THEM. FUN TO PLAY WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT COLORS.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years, there is nothing better!!&lt;br /&gt;You only have to put on twice a day and it stays!!</li>
    <li> My friend introduced me to these years ago, and they are difficult to find now (except on amazon.com).  They last a really long time on my lips and don&#x27;t leave marks on glasses, they change to soft pinks and corals on my lips and they have aloe, so they make my lips soft.  Add to that, that they are very inexpensive, and WOW!!  They are wonderful!</li>
    <li> Several years ago, I bought this product from QVC and loved it.  Formula must have changed.  Though the lipstick says on your lips and not on your coffee cup or glass, it bleeds along the lines around your mouth.  The colors were much LOUDER than I ordered before.  Really not sure I would buy these again....  Plus there was no chart as  there was when I did purchase from QVC (ie; that blue was deep pink on your lips and black is mauve on your lips)</li>
    <li> I was super excited to get these-I figured with 10 different colours, I&#x27;d get 10 different shades.  Nope.  Every single one of them ended up the same petal-pink.  I tried 3 different days, just in case it was my mood that was the problem.  Nope. I&#x27;m not that consistent, mood wise.  But these lipsticks sure were.&lt;br /&gt;3 stars because they are moisturizing, and and stay on for a long time.  I guess it&#x27;s a good thing petal pink works with my skintone!</li>
    <li> Some of the colors stay on longer than others.  I may try to order just those colors that really do stay on for hours.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like that fact that all the colors turn red or light red when I put it on. Even the Blue and green turns red!</li>
    <li> I have pale lips but dislike reapplying lipstick in public after each meal so l am a difinite fan for long lasting lipsticks. I  used Wilson Mood Matcher lipsticks in the past and was very satisfied. As l now live outside USA, l cannot find Wilson or any other good long wearing lipsticks. I have to settle for internationally well known brand lipstck that claim to be long lasting but not up to my expectation. While browsing Amazon, l came across good old Wilson Mood Matcher lipsticks l used to buy. A 10 pack costs lesser than a single  branded one l am using! I was happy and ordered a 10 pack. I am sorry to give it a 4 stars instead of 5 because today&#x27;s Wilson lipstick is not as long lasting as those l bought many years ago. Nevertheless it lasts longer than those well known expensive ones.. Another quality l like is the product does not dry up and crack my lips like those cheap lipsticks.</li>
    <li> Love this lipstick. I had some 15 years ago and just found it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this line for a while now and I totally love them. So much so that this past Christmas I added them as stuffers for all my girlfriends- amazing feedback! Total hit!&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS for colors&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS for staying power&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy these again- just to get the colors I don&#x27;t already have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Annie)</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  I had bought some on QVC Home shopping and used it all up.  Thought I would never see it again.  I had a tube used up but not thrown away so decided to do a search on Amazon.  Sure enough, it was there and I was delighted.  I like the way it lasts on my lips and goes on creamy smooth.</li>
    <li> thats my fault though&lt;br /&gt;i was so excited to find green and other colorful lipsticks that i didnt read clearly&lt;br /&gt;plus, it stains my lips, is too difficult to get off, and turns pink no matter which one i put on...</li>
    <li> if you want lip color that lasts, choose this product.  if you are swimming or can&#x27;t re-do regular lipstick every 3-4 hours, this color will stain your lips.  you can layer other colors on top to fill-in over the pink tones.  it&#x27;s a true stain, but for someone with small lips the color pops and you can really use it to show off against your hair color and make up.</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas and was thrilled. I tried on the dark blue right away and it kinda worked, but it left a pink line on my inner lips. (From the tip of the lipstick) I continually rubbed my lips together in hopes it would blend but it turned my lips bright pink. Same with bright red and yellow! Those are the only ones I&#x27;ve tried so far. So if you are looking for a temporary color then bright pink this is your product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a lot of lipsticks but I can tell these are really good. I tried the black as soon as I opened the package, and it&#x27;s a lovely berry color. I can tell it&#x27;s going to last a long time because I got a little on my hand and it -won&#x27;t- rub off! Can&#x27;t wait to try the other colors. I&#x27;d love some suggestions for a good lip liner to pair these with :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: after using all of the colors, I noticed one thing they have in common: they get brighter the longer I wear them! It&#x27;s not a bad thing for me, but most of them are basically a neon pink by the end of the day. I still love them though :)</li>
    <li> Once you discover what color (it turns) works for you, it is great for water, beach and outdoor sports.  Not only for the lips but for the cheeks and doesn&#x27;t wash off.</li>
    <li> All of these turned bright pink on me and 3 of my friends.  Unfortunately, I am a redhead and pink is not a good color for my pale skin and carrot top head.  So, if pink is a good color for you get these.  Well, I would buy a single or the smaller set.  There is a very small difference the colors but really not much.</li>
    <li> These are okay, but not quite what I was expecting. They all turned out to be a different shade of pink, but the colors do turn out nicely. A little warning to a future buyer, they do stain. \</li>
    <li> I read a NYTimes article years ago about an old fashion icon.  When asked what her &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; skin care/and or/ cosmetics were, she simply responded, &amp;#34;the green MoodMatcher Lipstick&amp;#34;.  I tried it, and love it too!</li>
    <li> Good Colors. Natural to Colorful. Color Lasts. Many Different Shades. Good Value. Lasts for Many Months, Have Ordered for Years.</li>
    <li> I have used the &amp;#34;MoodMatcher&amp;#34; lipstick for years, and really like it.  Many major brands have recently come out with lip color / lip tints which stay on &amp;#34;all day&amp;#34;, but in my opinion, for the price, you can&#x27;t beat these.  They go on smoothly and are moist and pretty to wear, AND they act more as a lip TINT -- the color lasts MUCH longer than normal lipstick.  Most of the colors are more vibrant than pastel when applied, so if you don&#x27;t like lipstick with much color, these might not be for you, but I love them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very upset with this why does it say its a  lipstick and when I put it on it was not a lipstick at all it was like a gloss and clear I wanted a real lipstick this is a ripoff  I wanted a yellow colored and all these colors I put the damn stuff in and it sucks not even the color it&#x27;s like clear the green goes on red and I&#x27;m very pissed about this I wanted real lipsticks that go on as the color it says</li>
    <li> color stayed on lips so nicely</li>
    <li> (I HAVE A PHOTO OF ALL THE COLORS ON ME BUT CANT UPLOAD FOR SOME REASON)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you put this stuff on, it is ON. Let me be clear- it stayed on me for 2 days when I tried the first color. For me this was somewhat unfortunate as my inner goth girl couldn&#x27;t help herself and immediately had to apply the black variety. As soon as I saw the wildly intense magenta on my lips I tried remove it. As yet, I have still not found a makeup remover powerful enough to get this stuff off completely; I&#x27;m guessing that a sandblaster might do the trick. When I went to work the next morning my lips were still obviously quite magenta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On me (very fair skinned red head) pretty much every shade turned some variation of intnese fuchsia or intense magenta when applied as you would apply a non-circus clown variety of lipstick. The darker the color is in the tube the darker or more intense the shade of fuchsia/magenta will be.The light pink immediately went into the trash because it was so frosty it made me look like a dead body found in the aftermath of some sort of electronic dance music festival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All joking aside, I think that the colors might actually look really really nice on someone with olive, brown, or black skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best use I have found is to apply it VERY lightly, wait a few moments for it to set, wipe off the excess and cover with a slightly tinted shiny lip balm. As a lip stain their staying power is almost miraculous, but buying the entire sample pack just to get two different versions of the same to hue seems a little bit silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the magic ingredient is in this stuff that makes it stay on for so long. If I ever find out I&#x27;m going to figure out how to make lip stains in colors other than fuchsia and magenta and then take over the world.</li>
    <li> I did not really need this many color choices, and the packaging is still really basic; however, I was thrilled to discover that this product was still available.  Used it for years, years ago.  Lasts extremely well.  Can control color simply by tapping a small bit on lower lip and pressing lips together; I add a bit of coconut oil for sheer gloss.  Very lightweight.  Keeping all the tubes in a glass in the bathroom cupboard; don&#x27;t have to carry one around since they do last all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Fran Wilson Moodmatcher lipstick for years. I hope they&#x27;re around for ever!</li>
    <li> They have reduced the intensity of the colors.  I like the old ones better and I would greatly prefer to choose the colors I want rather than being forced to buy the entire line of ten.</li>
    <li> This is a Great collection of long lasting lipsticks!  They last all day, and they don&#x27;t dry out your lips!</li>
    <li> On the description they say each color gives a certain effect on your lips but no matter what color I bought, my lips were the SAME BRIGHT FLOURESCENT PINK that looked awful and very fake.  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID! I threw them in the trash because they would not give my money back.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it is not considered hazardous waste.</li>
    <li> I like the product dont get me wrong but i wanted it for the colors not more pinks and reds lol. It does say on the lips like a good stain but yet again it was a surprise when i put the black one on and instantly turns red.</li>
    <li> Left to right ( red, orange , yellow , green , light blue , dark blue , purple , pink , brown , black ) I like how they are all different colors and it came on the expected date which is amazing :) I will definitely order again once I run out .  I love these and all the different shades of pink . I like the fact that it lasts and you don&#x27;t have to reapply too many times unlike other lipsticks . Overall happy with my product .</li>
    <li> These mood marchers make great little gifts, like stocking stuffers, and I love them for myself. The colors stay on better and longer than even the expensive &#x27;lasting&#x27; lipsticks and keep my lips from clapping in the winter!</li>
    <li> The only mood you get is RED!! A waste of money. I brought this under the impression that the colors was true to color</li>
    <li> I like the MOOD lipstick and I like the different colors.  There&#x27;s one to match everything.  A friend saw mine, asked if I ever found it again to get some for her.  I surprised her at Christmas with a set.  She was delighted.  Have been using it for many years, but it is much harder to find now than it used to be.  It is the only lipstick I can find that will stay on longer than an hour.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the type of person that lipstick companies love...since the stuff doesn&#x27;t stay on my lips for more that about 40 minutes, I&#x27;m in constant search of the Holy Grail of lipstick: one that won&#x27;t dry out my pucker and will stay on and on and on.&lt;br /&gt;The MoodMatcher set looks like it would give a huge range of colors but the reality is that the overwhelming shade is pink. Pink in different tones, but pink all the same. The red is actually a good red and the brown more a brick tone but all the others are pink.&lt;br /&gt;The pink shades stay on really well. The red and brick fade on me after about 1 1/2 hours. Better than most, but certainly not of the &amp;#34;all day&amp;#34; variety.&lt;br /&gt;If I purchase these again it would be the individual colors instead of the set.</li>
    <li> Good price for 10 lipsticks; however, they are all RED...not really any shades of pink. Not bad though. I used to wear these lipsticks in the 80&#x27;s and was surprised to see them here.</li>
    <li> Not what expected. The sticks are not the colors that they appear to be when applied. I guess that&#x27;s my fault for not doing research. I didn&#x27;t know they would all be different shades of only pink and red.</li>
    <li> Lipsticks ALL turn lips pick when applied. They do NOT tint lips any other colors. Returned &amp; disappointed teen.</li>
    <li> All shades look the same shade of pink. Did not last.</li>
    <li> I bought 4 packages from mood matcher lipsticks before 3 days . But you didn&#x27;t take the payment . What is the problem ??!!!&lt;br /&gt;Please help me ??!!</li>
    <li> I saw that these were highly regarded in a forum, and I like several things about them. They don&#x27;t have an odd odor and they feel very nice - not drying like other long lasting lipsticks I&#x27;ve tried, and they do have a lot of staying power.  However, when I got them I tried them in random order (on different days).  The first 4 turned an intense magenta on me, which I would not wear out of the house.  The one that is brown in the tube turns a slightly brick red that I can wear, though I&#x27;m not crazy about it.  At that point I gave the unopened ones to a friend, and the first one she tried turned a very nice color on her.  I figure I got at least 2 worthwhile lipsticks out of this purchase - maybe several more when she gets around to trying the rest.  I like this multi pack as a way to experiment and find a good color for me, but I was a little turned off by the number of them that all looked the same wrong color on me.  Of course, the same thing often happens when you pick colors off a shelf. At this price, they make novel little gifts or stocking stuffers, too, though a little hit or miss.</li>
    <li> These lipstick are similar to the old &amp;#34;Tangee Natural&amp;#34; lipstick.</li>
    <li> I have used MoodMatchers lipstick for many years. It is the only lipstick that stays on. I usually touch my lipstick up several times a day, But with Mood Matchers I don&#x27;t have to. I put it on &amp; it stays on.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Fran J</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to getting this, but was not able to use any of the colors....my daughters tried it and no luck. I guess I will have to throw them away. Such a waste of money. I won&#x27;t purchase anything like this again!</li>
    <li> Years ago I had a lipstick that had two Moodmatchers colors molded into one stick. The problem then was that neither were flattering to me and they lasted a long time. Today after trying longlasting lip color and fleeting lipstains totalling way over the cost of the 10-piece set, I bought it for its staining properties.  MY APPLICATION VERSION: Test the colors on the smooth skin of your arm (where it will be covered by clothing, unless you want to explain!) and decide what color stick produces the color you prefer. Check again several hours later after the colors have fully developed. Next, test the final colors on your lips either one at a time or all at once in different areas, but DON&#x27;T apply as regular lipstick. Gently pounce the lipstick over your lips or touch a clean fingertips to the color and smooth on your lips from your finger. This subtle approach means you can experiment with strengths or blends of the colors without needing to stay inside all day or at the very least, resorting to blotting and wiping with petroleum jelly. You may find a shade perfect on its own, or fine as a lasting base color under other lip products. So long as the upper layer is not oily, Moodmatcher should make a non-drying, long-lasting base depending on your own skin type.</li>
    <li> Great color from most of the colors!! Perfect for mood, bc each color is diff some are brighter some are less to show! Blk and green are my favs brown not so much but each person if diff! Have fun:)</li>
    <li> This is best  &amp;#34;stay on&amp;#34; lipstick except for neutrogena&#x27;s LipLife . (I started using over 60 years ago .Enjoy .</li>
    <li> So disappointed in mood marcher lipsticks. I originally ordered the green off Miles Kimball site, which was wonderfully priced with low shipping cost, yet I didn&#x27;t like the hot pink color the green left. So eagerly I looked for &#x27;darker&#x27; colors to which I found sorces online and read others reviews on what tones the others left. I could only find other matcher colors on the Fran Wilson site, so I ordered the blue, purple and black, and since the shopping for these tiny lipsticks was nearly $8 across the board I ordered the yellow as well in hopes of a soft, neutral pink. The Fran Wilson site didn&#x27;t offer much friendly user options, so I was unsure when I could expect my order, but a week later it arrived. I was so excited and tried the blue first, it was hot pink! Then the black, it was hot pink! Then the purple, it was hot pink! Then for irritated giggles I tried the yellow, it was hot pink! Over these several days of trying different colors each time I became more disappointed and angry - they all come out the same color! Of course I go to the Fran Wilson website to seek information on returning these products and understandably they have limitations due to hygiene, though no return service for upset customers, such as &amp;#34;hey, sorry you&#x27;re unhappy with the product, but we stand behind it - though we understand you had to USE the product to find out that you didn&#x27;t like it we&#x27;ll offer you a refund along with the ridiculous shipping cost like every other companies consumers&amp;#34;. I was truly excited to find these lipsticks after so many years and many fond memories, but they&#x27;re nothing like I remember ... or perhaps it was because in the 80&#x27;s hot pink was the &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; to wear. Even though the lipsticks were $3 each and the shipping was $8 it&#x27;s really the principal of throwing away $20 on junk. My suggestion for future buyers - only order one, green being a great starting point and stop there. AND don&#x27;t use Fran Wilson&#x27;s website - go Miles Kimball or Amazon -You&#x27;ll still come out cheaper when all is said and done.</li>
    <li> So before i bought this i read a couple reviews which seemed to be all good. I dont know how i missed the fact that they are all pink and red. None of them are true to color which was the reason i bought them to begin with. I thought i was going to get blue and greens .. Literally it makes ur lips feel greasy and pink like a cheap lip balm. DO NOT WASTE UR MONEY</li>
    <li> This assortment was fun to share with the family. There was a color for everyone. I use it daily and it stays on all day.</li>
    <li> Almost all the colors end up looking pink. They are more like cheap chapsticks than lipstick. It is a complete waste of money, and the pink is very difficult to remove as it seemed to stain my lips.</li>
    <li> The best lipstick ever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying these but like I said before, I wish the color would last a little longer.</li>
    <li> great product..  long lasting on the lips...does not cake up on the lips .......the  price for 10 tubes.......wow....... only my brown one came broken....still very  happy happy with my purchase......will buy more in future with amazon...</li>
    <li> have been using for years and love the lipsticks</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this type of lipstick since the 70&#x27;s. So glad to find them available on Amazon. Love the colors and they stay on better than any other lipsticks I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I like these they are super fun and I like that they will last all day long. I was hoping for more variety in color. They all seem to be the same pink color.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years and was so glad to find them still available.  This set has 10 different shades, the most I&#x27;ve ever had.  They are very smooth going on and stay on all day.  Thanks!!!!</li>
    <li> They are very good and love the colors they change to.</li>
    <li> I knew they were mood lipstick, but I thought they would at least remain close to the color they come in. Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;They ALL turned red! I&#x27;d  wanted to pay40$ for red lipsticks, I would&#x27;ve done so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrible overall. Dont  waste your money unless yo  want 10 red lipsticks.</li>
    <li> i have worn these lip sticks and they all produce the same colors.  what is the purpose of &amp;#34;mood&amp;#34; lipstick if every color is the same?</li>
    <li> I have used these lipsticks since I bought them on from a shopping show about 25 years ago.  These stay on my lips a lot longer than any lipstick or lip gloss.  I will continue to have these in my purse and make-up bag. Love them.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is my &amp;#34;little secret&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;Oh well I guess not so much a secret anymore.&lt;br /&gt;It stays on all day and has so many colors to choose from.</li>
    <li> Each color of the lipstick changes on my skin to a color that compliments me. I owned this type of lipstick many years ago and am so pleased to find it on Amazon.The lipstick has a nice flow when applied and stays on for a long time.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS LIPSTICK FOR 15 YEARS.  I STARTING BUYING IT THOUGH AND ORGANIZATION THAT SOLD IT, AND NOW I AM SO GLAD THAT I HAVE FOUND THE LINK TO PURCHASE IT MYSELF.  I NOW HAVE MANY OF MY FRIENDS USING IT.  THE BEST PART OF MOOD LIPSTICK IS THAT IT APPEARS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ON EACH PERSON.  TRY IT.  YOU WILL DEFINITELY LIKE IT AND IT REALLY DOES STAY ON FOR A LONG TIME</li>
    <li> Have used this lipstick for too many years to count.  I love everything about them...they last forever, are a great value, and, consistently look perfect.  Would simply not ever want to be without one in my purse and many in my makeup cabinet...don&#x27;t be afraid to give them a try!  Was VERY pleased to be able to order them on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Have used FW moodmatcher lipsticks for years; the crazy colors turn unbelievably NICE!  And they feel good on the lips, too.</li>
    <li> Not what i expected ! I really didnt see a point in then being different colors when they all show up the same ! And they&#x27;re extremely greasy !! When i read the reviews I thought they were going to be vibrant colors which they WERE NOT!!!</li>
    <li> this is rated ok because i thought it was true to its color not mood matcher lip stick. next time ithink amazon should have blue lipstick,green and all the neons color not artificial bout the real thing.</li>
    <li> I had a new friend who had chapped lips.  She said she had trouble with lipsticks.  I told her about MoodMatcher Lipstick, that it would solve her problem.  I ordered her a set.  She hasn&#x27;t had chapped lips since.  I am back for a new set of moodmatchers for myself.  I always use it for moist soft lips.  Thank you, Fran Wilson  PS: The colors are great. Mrs Donald Anderson</li>
    <li> Wonderful product great value</li>
    <li> Fun using these lipsticks. Creamy and long wearing.</li>
    <li> I first purchased these lipsticks (I believe) 30yrs ago from QVC. After they stopped selling them, I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere. Only knock offs that didn&#x27;t deliver what these do. I can&#x27;t keep lipstick on more than 30minutes. I tend to eat it off or something! But not these! These last the whole day &amp; into the evening.(small touch up to refresh of needed) I can eat &amp; drink &amp; still have color! Wish they would come in Earthtones. You won&#x27;t be disappointed! Thanks Fran Wilson &amp; Amazon!</li>
    <li> Best lipsticks ever!  Really stays on like no other!  I will be purchasing many more!  I have used some as gifts and really made a hit!</li>
    <li> It really works. Depending on mood (body heat), the lipstick changes and matches your mood. Lipstick stays on a very long time. Even when drinking and eating. I recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the variety of color.  The pink and red are my favorites.  I love the long lasting color that I do not have to touch until I have a lunch break.  The color would last all day but, I like to give it a boost then.</li>
    <li> these are just amazing! All of them are pretty &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; though. Stay on for a long time and are not as moisturizing as the Aloe Vera Color Change Mood Lipstick Assorted Lipsticks, 12pc.</li>
    <li> The only problem I have is knowing which tube is what color.  They are good colors, but when you need a particular color it would be nice to have a chart.  Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
    <li> Love mood matcher lipsticks - get variety - wonderful price.  The item was carefully packaged, arrived promptly - the price was great.  This product lasts and last!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this lipstick!!  It stays on for hours!!  I purchased the 10 pack after trying 2 colors, green and blue, and loving the colors.  I&#x27;ve now used all 10 colors and have to say that I love all of them.  I thought for sure that there would be 1 or 2 that I wouldn&#x27;t wear, but that&#x27;s not the case.  Extra plus is that this lipstick doesn&#x27;t have the waxy taste or feel of other lipsticks.  It moistens your lips and gives you great color to boot!!  My husband doesn&#x27;t like to kiss me with lipstick on usually because he doesn&#x27;t like the taste, but with this lipstick, he doesn&#x27;t get the waxy taste.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It does not cause much drying on your lips. I do use it under my lipstick or balm. It lasts and lasts. I will continue to buy this product!</li>
    <li> As a person of color I&#x27;ve used a myriad of mood lipsticks,many purchased through Amazon with 100% satisfaction as they are hard to find in Shreveport especially in a collection of alternate shades.I received these and was pleased in every way price,shipping,variety of colors but on application the colors were a vivid magenta/fuchsia shade-no women of any color from pale skinned to the deepest coffee would look natural wearing these shades.As theatrical attention seeking items no doubt but on a serious note you&#x27;ll possibly appear ridiculous.Removal of this lipstick is also a challenge.I thought the first shades I applied might be off but each tube produced the same clownish effect.I will never try these again.Perhaps I&#x27;M just not creative enough.You can mix them with regular lipsticks but  I like the carefree feel of simply using a mood lipstick,no fuss but that&#x27;s me.I wrote this review simplty to add what might happen with these limited shades,Someone else might have a totally wonderful experience.</li>
    <li> Bought these because Linda Rodin said to and, again,she&#x27;s right. I shared them with my daughter. They&#x27;re moisterizing and easy and last forever...great base for lipstick and pencil. Try the blue, first, for a nice natural pink.</li>
    <li> Waste of money!  The colors are weird, and not moisturizing at all!</li>
    <li> Love the Fran Wilson Moodmatcher lipstick.  Have used this lipstick for the last 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;Lipstick stays on for hours.</li>
    <li> I never know what color I will end up with.  The only color I thought I knew was the brown.  Used it today and after a few hours I looked in the mirror and saw a bright red that matched nothing close to what I was wearing.  I have 12  tubes of useless lipstick.  Buy at you own risk.  Of course if you like surprises , then they may be for you, otherwise save your money.</li>
    <li> I did receive a damaged parcel and I sent it back.</li>
    <li> The price and the quality of the lipstick was exceptional. I use it everyday and only add a gloss when having special ocassions.</li>
    <li> The assortment should be a choice of for light,medium and dark complexion.</li>
    <li> I love the long lasting lipstick.  I also love that the color is not overwhelming and that it does not dry out my lips.</li>
