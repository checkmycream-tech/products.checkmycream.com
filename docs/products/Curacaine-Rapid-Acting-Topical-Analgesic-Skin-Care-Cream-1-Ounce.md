### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This stuff is the best.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>good luck to you.</li>
      <li>T want to scare you away from this product because it really is a good one</li>
      <li>do NOT want to scare you away from this product because it really is a good one</li>
      <li>If I ever need to use it to scrub the gravel out of some road-rash, I sure hope it still works!</li>
      <li>Shea butter is so far the best cream I have found for soothing my skin.</li>
      <li>Best ointment for local skin pain.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m guessing because the skin is softer on the inside and probably soaked in better.</li>
      <li>I make sure I have it with me all the time.</li>
      <li>I will definatly buy more.</li>
      <li>no numb feeling here, maybe i was expecting more.</li>
      <li>It is even better than the majority of prepackaged topical anesthetics that take 20-30 minutes to &amp;#34;sink in&amp;#34; and have to be covered with plastic wrap (but to be fair, those do sink farther into the skin).  </li>
      <li>You may wish to keep the very edges under the patches free of this medication to be sure your patches will stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I checked the expiration date and the product is still good until next year.</li>
      <li>What you might consider is this:  Make sure the area of your skin where you need to apply a patch is very clean AND very dry.  </li>
      <li>However, it works great on small injuries and bug bites.</li>
      <li>In hospital crash carts, there is an acronym for the 4 main emergency drugs used in resuscitation (as in true life or death).  </li>
      <li>In hospital crash carts, there is an acronym for the 4 main emergency drugs used in resuscitation (as in true life or death).  </li>
      <li>This is by far the single best OTC topical anesthetic I have ever found and used.  </li>
      <li>This Did absolutely NOTHING for me!</li>
      <li>Absolutely Nothing!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely going to need to last more than 9 months!  </li>
      <li>Does what it is suppose to works fast</li>
      <li>Worked very well for me.</li>
      <li>I got it because I live in the hot and humid Houston area and was being chewed to bits by mosquitos and fleas in the yard.  </li>
      <li>Shipping is about the same for a pound of it, it is thick and stay on, and since that quantity will last a long time, it&#x27;s a better deal although it does not provide perfect relief.</li>
      <li>Other medications are added on top of the Curacaine.</li>
      <li>I wanted to buy a THIRD tube to send off with my parents in a mosquito and sand flea infested &amp;#34;paradise&amp;#34; so this time I checked prices here on Amazon and sure enough it was a bit more than $2 less to buy it from this seller which really blew my mind!  </li>
      <li>PARTICULARLY if you already use Lidoderm or have severe heart disease.  </li>
      <li>PARTICULARLY if you already use Lidoderm or have severe heart disease.  </li>
      <li>So I paid almost twice as much to order from Amazon, as opposed to one of the marketplace sellers, thinking that amazon&#x27;s fresh shipment would have the longest possible expiration.  </li>
      <li>Not sure about rashes and such but does help my wife to be more comfortable with her bed sores.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get your hopes up too high.</li>
      <li>but I really feel that if I have the knowledge, especially to keep even a single person safe, it&#x27;s my duty to do so.</li>
      <li>but I really feel that if I have the knowledge, especially to keep even a single person safe, it&#x27;s my duty to do so.</li>
      <li>Outside part of my arm was not completely numb like the inside</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d think it would be the exact opposite.  </li>
      <li>This is going into my First Aid Kit on my adventure motorcycle for use in case of road rash, burns or deep wound management.  </li>
      <li>I first found Curacaine at my local drugstore.  </li>
      <li>but it was a specially compounded formulation of 3 different topical anesthetics.  </li>
      <li>There is only one single topical anesthetic I think is even better than Curacaine</li>
      <li>When the tube arrived, the expiry was marked as 07/2015.  </li>
      <li>It is used to return an abnormal heart rhythm back to normal.  </li>
      <li>It is used to return an abnormal heart rhythm back to normal.  </li>
      <li>It is very fast acting and consists of 4% lidocaine which is actually quite high compared to products from even less than a year ago that used a max of 1%.  </li>
      <li>(The max I&#x27;ve used of this so far is just enough to cover (&amp; rub in a bit) about 10-12 bites I received within just a couple of hours)&lt;br</li>

      <li>The smell can be a problem; look at reviews carefully for the least objectionable aroma (which is an odd sort of burnt wood smell, like a house that has burned down...not surprising since it is made from tree bark).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this before hair removal and it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> This stuff works. I wish I knew about it years ago.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find any lotion with this amount of lidocane in stores.  This stuff is the best.  I had a strange blood staff infection OR blood yeast infection that was driving me insane.  I wouldn&#x27;t have any visible signs of a rash, but any contact my skin made with anything set me on fire like I was laying in an ant bed.  It was horrible and this helped when nothing else did.</li>
    <li> Put this stuff on and left it on my arm for an hour before my tattoo and wrapped my arm in plastic wrap. Numbed up the inside of my arm to the point I felt nothing. Outside part of my arm was not completely numb like the inside I&#x27;m guessing because the skin is softer on the inside and probably soaked in better. I will definatly buy more. And at a fraction of the price of the namebrand stuff ($40) you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Does what it is suppose to works fast</li>
    <li> It does work on relieving pain for sores. Not sure about rashes and such but does help my wife to be more comfortable with her bed sores. Other medications are added on top of the Curacaine. The Curacaine takes the edge off of the pain and itching. Other topical medications help to heal the sores.</li>
    <li> This is by far the single best OTC topical anesthetic I have ever found and used.  It is very fast acting and consists of 4% lidocaine which is actually quite high compared to products from even less than a year ago that used a max of 1%.  It is even better than the majority of prepackaged topical anesthetics that take 20-30 minutes to &amp;#34;sink in&amp;#34; and have to be covered with plastic wrap (but to be fair, those do sink farther into the skin).  There is only one single topical anesthetic I think is even better than Curacaine but it was a specially compounded formulation of 3 different topical anesthetics.  I do not count the Rx patches in this as they are something completely different.  I first found Curacaine at my local drugstore.  I got it because I live in the hot and humid Houston area and was being chewed to bits by mosquitos and fleas in the yard.  Though I think it was a bit pricy at my local store, it worked SO well that I went and bought a second tube.  I wanted to buy a THIRD tube to send off with my parents in a mosquito and sand flea infested &amp;#34;paradise&amp;#34; so this time I checked prices here on Amazon and sure enough it was a bit more than $2 less to buy it from this seller which really blew my mind!  My local big chain pharmacy/store is less than 1/8 of a mile from my home!  You&#x27;d think it would be the exact opposite.  So crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, I apologize in advance for the rest of my review because it is a bit of a downer.  I am a nurse and would like to add a few safety comments/concerns, so please bear with me.  If you have been prescribed the Lidocaine 5% patches (Lidoderm) but want  immediate relief.  What you might consider is this:  Make sure the area of your skin where you need to apply a patch is very clean AND very dry.  Use a THIN film of the Curacaine and let dry THOROUGHLY and then apply your patch.  You may wish to keep the very edges under the patches free of this medication to be sure your patches will stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT want to scare you away from this product because it really is a good one and it&#x27;s about time the FDA trusts us enough not to hurt ourselves with it!  However, I would like to reiterate warnings about ANY lidocaine or other topical anesthetics PARTICULARLY if you already use Lidoderm or have severe heart disease.  In hospital crash carts, there is an acronym for the 4 main emergency drugs used in resuscitation (as in true life or death).  The acronym is L.E.A.D.  Well, as you may have guessed already, the &amp;#34;L&amp;#34; stands for LIDOCAINE.  It is used to return an abnormal heart rhythm back to normal.  So my point in telling you is this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USE ONLY AS DIRECTED!  You do NOT want to smear this stuff from head to toe ESPECIALLY on a child and ESPECIALLY if you already use a lidocaine product such as Lidoderm.  It CAN cause severe life threatening cardiac problems, the worst of the worst being that it can stop a perfectly healthy heart.  Just using a dab here and there throughout the day won&#x27;t hurt you or even a child.  Just don&#x27;t bathe in it, so to speak!  (The max I&#x27;ve used of this so far is just enough to cover (&amp; rub in a bit) about 10-12 bites I received within just a couple of hours)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my apologies for bringing things down but I really feel that if I have the knowledge, especially to keep even a single person safe, it&#x27;s my duty to do so.T want to scare you away from this product because it really is a good one and it&#x27;s about time the FDA trusts us enough not to hurt ourselves with it!

    <li> Best ointment for local skin pain.</li>
    <li> FOR ME, IT DIDN&#x27;T STOP THE ITCHING UNTIL I APPLIED IT AT LEASE 3 TIMES.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It works wonders and turns frowns into smiles. Highly recommend. I make sure I have it with me all the time.</li>
    <li> I have PHN ( post herpetic neuralgia) in my face and forehead.  The pain and burning are relentless, day and night.  This product gave me relief.</li>
    <li> This did not work at all for my foot pain.</li>
    <li> no numb feeling here, maybe i was expecting more.</li>
    <li> I used this several evenings after a chigger attack.  I could not have slept without it.  Worked very well for me.</li>
    <li> This is not a powerful numbing agent. However, it works great on small injuries and bug bites. A little goes a long way, but effect is topical, not deep tissue relief.</li>
    <li> Excelent product!&lt;br /&gt;Is a lot cheaper then the same at the pharmacy, I totally recommended.</li>
    <li> expensive and didn&#x27;t relieve itching...had to resort to a ben-gay type topical ointment for a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> This Did absolutely NOTHING for me! I was so disappointed. I applied it as instructed prior to derma rolling and I felt every single one of those needles! Not a fun experience! I understand stay we all feel pain differently so I try to save this and use it for insect bites. Results? Absolutely Nothing! I checked the expiration date and the product is still good until next year. Guess it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get your hopes up too high. I suffer from persistent itching on my arm from psoriasis, and at the back of my neck from a burn that killed the natural oil-producing glands (you&#x27;re not aware of their need until you&#x27;ve lost them!). Nothing seems to relieve the itch on either spot (I&#x27;ve tried everything in the drugstore and have gone to dermatologists to no effect). I had hoped to numb the nerves under my skin like a dentist using novacaine, but this is far too weak to notice any such effect. About the same ineffective result as all other OTC &amp;#34;itch relieving&amp;#34; creams; i.e., not much. Even the lowest shipping cost of this little tube was outrageous, and considering the lack of significant relief, I won&#x27;t buy again. Shea butter is so far the best cream I have found for soothing my skin. Shipping is about the same for a pound of it, it is thick and stay on, and since that quantity will last a long time, it&#x27;s a better deal although it does not provide perfect relief. The smell can be a problem; look at reviews carefully for the least objectionable aroma (which is an odd sort of burnt wood smell, like a house that has burned down...not surprising since it is made from tree bark). Itching is no joke, so good luck to you.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t applied the cream yet, so no comments on efficacy.  I&#x27;d like to comment on the expiration date.  I noticed some complaints about early expiration in other reviews.  Amazon was out-of-stock when I was going to purchase, but the item came back into stock just before I ordered.  So I paid almost twice as much to order from Amazon, as opposed to one of the marketplace sellers, thinking that amazon&#x27;s fresh shipment would have the longest possible expiration.  When the tube arrived, the expiry was marked as 07/2015.  That&#x27;s only 9 months from now.  WTF?  This is going into my First Aid Kit on my adventure motorcycle for use in case of road rash, burns or deep wound management.  It&#x27;s definitely going to need to last more than 9 months!  If I ever need to use it to scrub the gravel out of some road-rash, I sure hope it still works!</li>
    <li> Works well, I would recommend it.</li>
