### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I have tested it by doing TV in the morning, followed by gym, followed by a no-wash-face shower, followed by a 4 mile meet &amp; greet, in tropical heat, and at the end of all that I was still flawless!</li>
      <li>Best primer I have every tried and I tried everything.</li>
      <li>I got the best results when I applied moisturizer before the primer.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect skin prep for the summer months.  </li>
      <li>Good stuff, will order again!!!</li>
      <li>You can apply liquid foundation by hand or brush, but the best method is probably stippling with a brush or beauty blender.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>This product does keep your makeup on throughout the day and it makes your makeup look good in pictures.</li>
      <li>It shipped quickly and the product is great.</li>
      <li>Makeup adheres better to skin -</li>
      <li>This product is amazing, and worth every cent.</li>
      <li>After the primer dries, liquid foundation should be applied with a very quick hand.</li>
      <li>issue: this product dries very quickly to a tacky texture.</li>
      <li>Love this for those hot and humid days!</li>
      <li>I live in the Caribbean and this thing is amazing.</li>
      <li>Maybe you should rename it Hot Flash Tamer!</li>
      <li>Makeup stays put and looks fresh for 12+ hours WITHOUT any touch up</li>
      <li>This product is better than urban decay all nighter!</li>
      <li>This is my recommendation, put sunscreen or moisturizer on your clean face first, leave it on for a couple of minutes then use the Mehron Skin product and continue with your regular makeup routine, foundation, etc...</li>
      <li>and it was really hot with high humidity</li>
      <li>It does not block sweat as much as I was hoping it would.</li>
      <li>Wow, this is really a miracle product.  </li>
      <li>In the humidity and under the hot studio lights I will start to break out in a sweat above my lip, on the sides of my face, and my brow.</li>
      <li>To put this into context, I live in Southern California and we experience high heat and high</li>
      <li>I got several large pimples while wearing this and as soon as I stopped and just used sunscreen and my makeup</li>
      <li>but yesterday I was outside the whole day</li>
      <li>It works really well to keep makeup on throughout the day but my skin is prone to break-outs and this definitely irritated my skin.</li>
      <li>I applied it on a hot and humid day and totally stayed dry.</li>

    <li> This product is amazing, and worth every cent. To put this into context, I live in Southern California and we experience high heat and high humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Makeup stays put and looks fresh for 12+ hours WITHOUT any touch up&lt;br /&gt;- Makeup adheres better to skin - I ended up using less foundation, bronzer, and highlighter. This primer ENHANCES color payoff in other products&lt;br /&gt;- Primer does not feel thick or uncomfortable on the skin throughout the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue: this product dries very quickly to a tacky texture. I got the best results when I applied moisturizer before the primer. After the primer dries, liquid foundation should be applied with a very quick hand. Otherwise, the foundation will begin to collect unevenly in blotches. You can apply liquid foundation by hand or brush, but the best method is probably stippling with a brush or beauty blender. Stippling will prevent the foundation from sticking to the primer in blotches</li>
    <li> Deodorant for the face seriously</li>
    <li> This kept my make-up on all day. This product is better than urban decay all nighter!</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have this in your life, you are missing out.  This is the perfect skin prep for the summer months.  Try it, you would like it.</li>
    <li> Best primer I have every tried and I tried everything. Kept my oily skin matte all day in the Florida&#x27;s heat and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> This does help reduce facial sweating, but it doesn&#x27;t last all day-- Maybe 4-6 hours.</li>
    <li> Wow, this is really a miracle product.  I have combination skin but yesterday I was outside the whole day and it was really hot with high humidity but my face got a a little oily on my nose in the afternoon.  This is my recommendation, put sunscreen or moisturizer on your clean face first, leave it on for a couple of minutes then use the Mehron Skin product and continue with your regular makeup routine, foundation, etc... I suggest that you apply your foundation with a damp sponge so that you can get an even coverage because the product will tend to streak a little.</li>
    <li> Love this for those hot and humid days! Make up stays in place and I don&#x27;t sweat or get oily</li>
    <li> I have really bad hot flashes and I sweat my makeup off as soon as I try to put it on. Then I found this little miracle! I applied it on a hot and humid day and totally stayed dry. Even the next day! A must for anyone going through menopause! Maybe you should rename it Hot Flash Tamer!</li>
    <li> Good stuff, will order again!!!</li>
    <li> I live in the Caribbean and this thing is amazing. I have tested it by doing TV in the morning, followed by gym, followed by a no-wash-face shower, followed by a 4 mile meet &amp; greet, in tropical heat, and at the end of all that I was still flawless!</li>
    <li> It shipped quickly and the product is great.</li>
    <li> This works so well. Zero sweat all day. It does make you skin feel dry and tight, but put moisturizer on after. My makeup last longer. No more embarrassing facial sweat.</li>
    <li> When you put it on your face it feels like you have a thin mask on. It does do its job, but it sorta makes my foundation look cakey even when I apply my foundation with a beauty blender. This product does keep your makeup on throughout the day and it makes your makeup look good in pictures.</li>
    <li> It works really well to keep makeup on throughout the day but my skin is prone to break-outs and this definitely irritated my skin. I got several large pimples while wearing this and as soon as I stopped and just used sunscreen and my makeup it went away.</li>
    <li> kept my makeup on all day</li>
    <li> It does not block sweat as much as I was hoping it would. In the humidity and under the hot studio lights I will start to break out in a sweat above my lip, on the sides of my face, and my brow. I have to use a fan to keep the sweats at bay.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> Disliked...it didn&#x27;t work for my Texas heat</li>
    <li> Kept my skin, tight &amp; not oily! Worked like a charm!</li>
    <li> Works well. I don&#x27;t sweat off my makeup.</li>
