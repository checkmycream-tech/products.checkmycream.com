      <li>Thanks for the awesome shipment and product; I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Easy to carry.</li>
      <li>Simply put, they work and taste great - all flavors.  </li>
      <li>The product is very useful but the price is way out of line.</li>
      <li>First and most important-</li>
      <li>cool mint flavor</li>
      <li>Cool taste.</li>
      <li>A good simple breath mint.</li>
      <li>I feel more confident in social situations after I have used one or even two of these Listerine mints.</li>
      <li>first world problem, but this is an easy solution.</li>
      <li>- it may seem too strong the first time you try it</li>
      <li>Listerine strips are great for fresh breath, they fit in any pocket, and they don&#x27;t annoy other people!</li>
      <li>clean fresh mouth, remember to breath through your nose too.</li>
      <li>Sure, individual packs and the case of twelve costs more than rolls of Certs; but these Listerine \\&quot;strips\\</li>
      <li>always keep a pack in my pocket, freshen your breath really quickly on the way to a meeting, etc.</li>
      <li>Typically, I use 3-6 strips each day and I do that because, as far as I know, they are the best breath freshener there is.</li>
      <li>Nice to carry around everywhere and leave in different bags.</li>
      <li>In addition, there is another use for these pocket packs of slender Listerine \\&quot;strips;\\&quot; and that is making your breath fresh.     </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s rare that happens.</li>
      <li>The Listerine PocketPack mint strips, will give you fresh breath for a couple of hours with no known side-effects.</li>
      <li>It is very helpful in getting a fresh clean breath</li>
      <li>Takes the coffee taste right out of your mouth,</li>
      <li>Right now I&#x27;m using Biotène toothpaste for my teeth and gums; but Listerine is very useful under normal conditions.</li>
      <li>cuz it&#x27;s listerine (meeting the word limit;)  )</li>
      <li>if cigarett or just to fell fresh before an intimate moment.</li>
      <li>They dissolve almost instantly so you can use these instead of a Certs mint if you need to make your breath fresh very quickly.     </li>
      <li>I keep them in the small pocket of my jeans on top of my regular pockets and use them before meetings or if I&#x27;m in the middle of a conversation (Very sneaky too :D)!&lt;br /&gt;These are awesome to have for students, business people or anyone for that matter!</li>
      <li>I love that it is compact and works for a long time (30 min or so).</li>
      <li>sure that you keep them in a dry place - the label recommends under 77% humidity because moisture in the air can cause for the strips to melt and stick together.</li>
      <li>It may sound funny, but it&#x27;d rather leave home without my American Express than take off without one of them</li>
      <li>I like the huge rush of flavor initially as well.</li>
      <li>reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>I have used Listerine Pocketpak Breath Strips for a couple year and really like them.  </li>
      <li>Single strips are easy to take out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, the freshening is so refreshing that it&#x27;s easy to use them even when unnecessary.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll probably be using them for as long as they are available for purchase.</li>
      <li>I LOVE these little strips of breath heaven.  </li>
      <li>I walked into Walgreens tonight and walked right back out because one of these 3-packs was 4.79.  </li>
      <li>I talk a lot my mouth gets super dry</li>
      <li>The mint flavor is really strong and it last a long time.  </li>
      <li>The only thing (and I don&#x27;t know what they can do about this) but if you are in hot weather the strips will coagulate together....</li>
      <li>Goods as expected, quick delivery.</li>
      <li>If it does smell I drink some water and pop one of these in, and swish it around to get all the bad breath and either spit it out or swallow (Not to sound sexual haha).</li>
      <li>Wow.  </li>
      <li>Not a physician - can&#x27;t comment as to general sensitivity among the population, but nonetheless urge you to use them</li>
      <li>I was not disappointed in the least.</li>
      <li>I was using several daily, and recently developed thrush - an overgrowth of the Candida fungus present in all of our mouths.  </li>
      <li>It turns out that the bactericide in the strips, if overused, will kill off enough other normal bacteria to allow the Candida to thrive unchecked.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great product because unlike gum you can discreetly keep it in your mouth as you are talking.  The mint flavor is really strong and it last a long time.  I also have noticed that my breath is fresher than before I used this product just by using one or two in the middle of the day.</li>
    <li> Perfect way to buy in bulk; same quality product and save money. I love these! The only thing (and I don&#x27;t know what they can do about this) but if you are in hot weather the strips will coagulate together.... but it&#x27;s rare that happens.</li>
    <li> I walked into Walgreens tonight and walked right back out because one of these 3-packs was 4.79.  So I pull up Amazon and I can get four of the 3-packs for over $21?  Wow.  The product is very useful but the price is way out of line.</li>
    <li> The Listerine PocketPack mint strips, will give you fresh breath for a couple of hours with no known side-effects. It may sound funny, but it&#x27;d rather leave home without my American Express than take off without one of them PocketPacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Listerine PocketPacks for about 10 years now and it&#x27;s been hardly a day without me using at least one of them strips. Typically, I use 3-6 strips each day and I do that because, as far as I know, they are the best breath freshener there is. I will not compare the PocketPack strips with the competition, whatever that is but, here are the benefits of using them, as I see them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- small - I keep them in my shirt pocket, in my car&#x27;s cup holders, in my office&lt;br /&gt;- near-zero calories&lt;br /&gt;- dissolve almost instantly&lt;br /&gt;- long lasting freshness - like I said, I used 3-6 in a typical day&lt;br /&gt;- cool mint flavor - it may seem too strong the first time you try it but you get used to them quickly&lt;br /&gt;- affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure that you keep them in a dry place - the label recommends under 77% humidity because moisture in the air can cause for the strips to melt and stick together. Other than that, they never spoil and don&#x27;t seem to lose their potency over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used these for the past 10 years and I&#x27;ll probably be using them for as long as they are available for purchase.</li>
    <li> Great.  Very useful and a good price.  Takes the coffee taste right out of your mouth,</li>
    <li> Combats dragon breath very effectively AND portable!</li>
    <li> Listerine oral care strips are a great disinfectant for killing bacteria in your mouth. This product can be used when you brush your teeth because this does kill germs. In addition, there is another use for these pocket packs of slender Listerine \\&quot;strips;\\&quot; and that is making your breath fresh.     Right now I&#x27;m using Biotène toothpaste for my teeth and gums; but Listerine is very useful under normal conditions. (I am finally recovering from cancer but my dentist told me to continue to use Biotène for now.) Nevertheless, I still use these strips of Listerine in their pocket packs as a great--and I do mean GREAT--breath freshener. They are easy to carry in a pocket because of the slender size of the pack in which they come; and they always do a great job of making my breath as fresh as it can be. I feel more confident in social situations after I have used one or even two of these Listerine mints. They dissolve almost instantly so you can use these instead of a Certs mint if you need to make your breath fresh very quickly.     Overall, I can&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough. Sure, individual packs and the case of twelve costs more than rolls of Certs; but these Listerine \\&quot;strips\\&quot; sure do a great job of keeping your breath fresh as it can be. These strips last a while after you buy them--but use them before the expiration date printed on the package.</li>
    <li> An investment for the future months and I love them! Thanks for the awesome shipment and product; I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> First and most important- These are cheapest i&#x27;ve ever bought these things! usually they cost 2 dollars a piece (as in one pack not 3 in 1)!&lt;br /&gt;When I talk a lot my mouth gets super dry and I feel like my breath smells bad, the way I test to see is I lick the top of my hand, wait 10-20 until it dries off and smell it. If it does smell I drink some water and pop one of these in, and swish it around to get all the bad breath and either spit it out or swallow (Not to sound sexual haha). I keep them in the small pocket of my jeans on top of my regular pockets and use them before meetings or if I&#x27;m in the middle of a conversation (Very sneaky too :D)!&lt;br /&gt;These are awesome to have for students, business people or anyone for that matter! Great price, great product!</li>
    <li> These are great for fresh breath on the go. Pop one in after that cup of coffee or puff if cigarett or just to fell fresh before an intimate moment. These are the best things ever made for a mouth full of refreshment.</li>
    <li> Price is good...love the product.  Easy to carry with you!  A must have for me in the work place and at home.</li>
    <li> It is very helpful in getting a fresh clean breath 24/7.  I always carry a pack in my pocket, throw in a strip after lunch or dinner keeps your breath smelling refreshing.</li>
    <li> Good deal for price. Nice to carry around everywhere and leave in different bags. Good for offering to people that need it! Same listerine quality cuz it&#x27;s listerine (meeting the word limit;)  )</li>
    <li> Have been using these for years....always keep a pack in my pocket, freshen your breath really quickly on the way to a meeting, etc. or after a spicy meal....work great.</li>
    <li> I have used Listerine Pocketpak Breath Strips for a couple year and really like them.  They can be hard to find locally, but Amazon has everything.</li>
    <li> Goods as expected, quick delivery. reasonable price.  Good Seller.</li>
    <li> Came in on time and works wonderfully. I love that it is compact and works for a long time (30 min or so). A good simple breath mint.</li>
    <li> Cool taste. Easy to carry. Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> These are great for when you chewing gum isn&#x27;t appropriate. They even kick onion breath for a fair amount of time. I like the huge rush of flavor initially as well. It gets the saliva going and wakes up the taste buds.</li>
    <li> Convenneint to carry around in my wallet. Know i will use these repeatedly so bought many of them. WOuld buy again.</li>
    <li> Handy pocket Listerine.</li>
    <li> Simply put, they work and taste great - all flavors.  Very easy to carry in pocket, briefcase, etc., with a long-lasting supply of 24 strips per pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the freshening is so refreshing that it&#x27;s easy to use them even when unnecessary.  If you ain&#x27;t talkin&#x27;, then you ain&#x27;t stinkin&#x27;.  I was using several daily, and recently developed thrush - an overgrowth of the Candida fungus present in all of our mouths.  Not pleasant.  It turns out that the bactericide in the strips, if overused, will kill off enough other normal bacteria to allow the Candida to thrive unchecked.  Not a physician - can&#x27;t comment as to general sensitivity among the population, but nonetheless urge you to use them sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to carry these, as they&#x27;re the best I&#x27;ve encountered, but with appropriate caution against overuse.</li>
    <li> It takes only a second to pop one into yuour mouth and bad breath is gone.  Thank you for your service.</li>
    <li> Been melting these bad boys for years</li>
    <li> My favorite flavor.  Neat, tidy package that fits anywhere!  Works on dry mouth!</li>
    <li> I think my worst pet peeve is sitting in meetings and people smacking their gum. Listerine strips are great for fresh breath, they fit in any pocket, and they don&#x27;t annoy other people!</li>
    <li> I love listerine strips, i always have a pack on me so if i eat something that leaves a residue then i just slip on of these bad boys on my toung and BAM clean fresh mouth, remember to breath through your nose too.</li>
    <li> Best price I have seen! So useful!!! These are powerful strips but can deal with any bad case of halitosis!</li>
    <li> I am incredibly happy with this product. It is exactly as I expected. I was not disappointed in the least.</li>
    <li> I use these all the time to freshen my breath, they are great.  I go through so many, I like to buy in bulk.  Great price on this product</li>

    <li> Great Product. Really beats carrying a small bottle of mouthwash to work. Each strip lasts about as long as a swirl of mouthwash does. Single strips are easy to take out.</li>
    <li> This listerine pocketpacks are the best for keeping my breath fresh after lunch or smoke. Great flavor in great size!</li>
    <li> My local club warehouse stopped selling them for a second time in bulk.  I LOVE these little strips of breath heaven.  The merchant got the item to me speedily to the smelling pleasure of those around me.</li>
