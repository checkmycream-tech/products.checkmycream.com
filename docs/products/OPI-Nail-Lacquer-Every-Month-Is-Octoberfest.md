      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Favorite polish such a gorgeous color!!</li>
      <li>Very cool product</li>
      <li>This is an absolutely beautiful wine with gold microglitter polish that will appear more red or more purple depending on the light.</li>
      <li>It is definitly more unique then a lot of the darker colors OPI has put out.</li>
      <li>all I strongly recommend the product and the seller to every body.</li>
      <li>so I went on the website and was very pleased to find it and at a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>Such a great color.</li>
      <li>My nails both look and feel stronger and thicker when this is applied, and they stand up impressively even to chores that usually destroy my nails.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, it is now in my top ten (maybe even top five!)</li>

      <li>This is a beautiful dark nail color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However the seller shipped it quickly and</li>
      <li>However this color is my new favorite.  </li>
      <li>If you like dark colors that can work for most skin tones for either an elegant, classic look or an edgier, vampy style with nothing more than a change of attire, this is definitely worth adding to your polish stash.</li>
      <li>So Much you notice a huge difference.</li>
      <li>I really liked the red in that color.  </li>
      <li>, this goes with pretty much everything and looks classic and elegant.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a pretty color just so not what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Was WAY more red than purple.</li>
      <li>I will definitely revisit the website for more purchases.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>The color is much more red than the picture.</li>
      <li>This nail color is hands down, my favorite nail color ever!  </li>
      <li>It is a perfect deep purple, black, red color.  </li>
      <li>The color is very dark, as pictured, but has a great deal of red to it.  </li>
      <li>expected more purple type color</li>
      <li>fast delivery</li>
      <li>I like it so much</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>black first and then top it with this color.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love the dark purple.</li>
      <li>First layer is very blue with purple undertones.  </li>
      <li>Without light it looks black.  </li>
      <li>Redder in artificial light than shown in the photo, but I still love it.</li>
      <li>Came early...</li>
      <li>This color is classy.</li>
      <li>Has a red tone, dark purple and blues depending on the light.</li>
      <li>Pretty dark stuff.  </li>
      <li>a deep Dark red-purple and sexy; changes colors slightly (to a deep burgundy with slight shimmer) in the light!&lt;br /&gt;OPI</li>
      <li>It appears as a dark red but shines a purple-ish hue, exactly like in the image.</li>
      <li>Similar to many other dark red OPI nail colors, but very different at the same time.</li>

    <li> This is an absolutely beautiful wine with gold microglitter polish that will appear more red or more purple depending on the light. I like it so much, it is now in my top ten (maybe even top five!) favorite shades out of an extremely large nail polish collection. If you like dark colors that can work for most skin tones for either an elegant, classic look or an edgier, vampy style with nothing more than a change of attire, this is definitely worth adding to your polish stash.</li>
    <li> I love this color! I think this will be my go to color this winter. It&#x27;s a basic dark purple with a hint of black and goes with everything. I&#x27;m a big OPI fan to begin with and this is another goody for my collection.</li>
    <li> Such a great color. I get compliments on it all the time! Perfect for fall.</li>
    <li> Was WAY more red than purple. And very, very thin. Very disappointed. It&#x27;s still a pretty color just so not what I was looking for. In order to get close to the color in the photo, I have to paint my nails black first and then top it with this color.&lt;br /&gt;However the seller shipped it quickly and it was well packaged!</li>
    <li> This goes for ALL of OPI Nail Lacquer, I LOVE ALL OF THEM!!!! Always and A+++++++ I would recommend these to everyone. Those of us who love nail polish, well we would pay to have them!!! Great colors!! Great service getting to me!!!! I love the way they shine!!!!</li>
    <li> a deep Dark red-purple and sexy; changes colors slightly (to a deep burgundy with slight shimmer) in the light!&lt;br /&gt;OPI quality</li>
    <li> IVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THIS COLOR!!!&lt;br /&gt;ONE COAT AND BOOM ULL FALL IN LOVE TOO!!&lt;br /&gt;EVERY MONTH IN OCTOBERFEST!!♡♡</li>
    <li> love the color, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Great color.  Dark purple that changes color in the sun.  Has a red tone, dark purple and blues depending on the light.</li>
    <li> The colour is actually a bit darker than I expected and has some undertones of dark blue/ purple, but all in all I really like it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This nail color is hands down, my favorite nail color ever!  If I could only chose one color to use for the rest of my life I would definitely chose this shade.  It is a perfect deep purple, black, red color.  It is truly gorgeous!!</li>
    <li> Redder in artificial light than shown in the photo, but I still love it.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful shade of purple! I got a manicure and had to buy the bottle after I left the nail salon. It has an iridescent thing going on too. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I love OPI.  I find that their nailpolish lasts at least two days longer than the other brands.  The color is very dark, as pictured, but has a great deal of red to it.  It&#x27;s really lovely.</li>
    <li> Similar to many other dark red OPI nail colors, but very different at the same time. Putting it next to my other colors such as Glove You So Much you notice a huge difference. Very nice rich color</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dark nail polish type of girl, although I don&#x27;t usually shell out for name brands.&lt;br /&gt;After trying this - together with OPI&#x27;s base &amp; top coat - I am completely converted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gorgeous, reddish purple hue, this goes with pretty much everything and looks classic and elegant. It is also rock solid! My nails both look and feel stronger and thicker when this is applied, and they stand up impressively even to chores that usually destroy my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big fan, and will gladly buy again.</li>
    <li> LOOOOOOVE this color...already on my fingers and toes! Came early...no complaints at all!!</li>
    <li> ITS GOOD BUT IT CHIPS IN 3 DAYS SO YOU WILL NEED A GOOD TOP COAT TO SEAL IT IN.</li>
    <li> amazing eggplant color</li>
    <li> expected more purple type color</li>
    <li> Favorite polish such a gorgeous color!!</li>
    <li> Very cool product the color is awesome.</li>
    <li> The picture is misleading. The color is much more red than the picture.</li>
    <li> I love this color and have always liked OPI because it seems to last the longest on my nails.</li>
    <li> I just love love love this color from OPI!!!  I saw a friend with it and wanted it so bad but no one sold it so I went on the website and was very pleased to find it and at a reasonable price.  I will definitely revisit the website for more purchases.</li>
    <li> I like the product.&lt;br /&gt;It looks like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;It matches the description.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;It came in a nice package.&lt;br /&gt;It was packed nicely and safe.&lt;br /&gt;It came sooner them promised time.&lt;br /&gt;Over all I strongly recommend the product and the seller to every body.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great color and lasts for a long time!  It&#x27;s perfect for any time of year..great holiday color too.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS POLISH. IT IS DEEPLY COLORED. IT IS NOT A ONE-DIMENSION POLISH.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a dark purple nail polish and stumbled upon this color.  I had gotten my nails done with Opi&#x27;s Black Cherry Chutney.  I really liked the red in that color.  However this color is my new favorite.  First layer is very blue with purple undertones.  Then with the second coat, the red sparkles that were in the Black Cherry Chutney.  I can&#x27;t stop watching the color change in different lights.  You should buy this color.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful wine color with twinkles. The quality is beautiful and perfect for Fall and Winter. I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This color is classy. It appears as a dark red but shines a purple-ish hue, exactly like in the image. It&#x27;s a great fall and winter color and I wear it all the time.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color...fast delivery</li>
    <li> My Wife Love it!!! Thanks.</li>
    <li> I love OPI and this is a perfect color for the season. I have many clothes in shades of purple that went perfectly with this nail polish. It stays on werarely if ever chips.</li>
    <li> This fingernail polish is&lt;br /&gt;very rich in texture and is very beautiful in any light.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Love the dark purple. It&#x27;s perfect!!! Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful dark nail color. It has fabulous undertones of purples and burgandies and would look good on a variety of skin tones. It is definitly more unique then a lot of the darker colors OPI has put out.</li>
    <li> high quality formula that dries without the annoying air bubbles. would definitely recommend the color and brand.</li>
    <li> The richest color in my OPI collection- love it!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color! I am a OPI fan big time! I am so happy with this purchase &#x3D;-D</li>
    <li> in love with this shade!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color.  Has a little bit of a navy blue cast to it.  LOOKS GREAT</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s close to dark black/blue... Not really what&#x27;s on the picture.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color!  Perfect consistency.  Great for fall.</li>
    <li> Pretty dark stuff.  Great for gothic dress.  Without light it looks black.  Was hoping for something a bit more plum based.</li>
