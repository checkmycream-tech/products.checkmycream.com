<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product that performs as dermatologist prescribed for my husband.  He’s been using this for a couple of years.  Price is good, especially since it’s difficult to find locally and we live in a large metropolitan area.</li>
    <li> This anti-dandruff shampoo is the best I have used...and I have tried a lot...from herbal to head and shoulders and more...&lt;br /&gt;I usually have so much dandruff at any given day...sometimes, it itch so bad...all the time, I could do &amp;#34;snow&amp;#34; just by frisking my hair, or change the color of my t-shirt to white.&lt;br /&gt;I tried some herbal shampoo...it is better than those head n shoulders...but it comes back after several hours. head and shoulders or those over the counter shampoos (clear, etc, etc, etc) don&#x27;t work for me at all (n I&#x27;ve tried all those u could buy from walmart)......&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m posting this review after the 2nd week of usage. The &amp;#34;snow&amp;#34; is gone....the itch is also gone.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this after reading hundreds of reviews and I&#x27;m glad the research paid off....&lt;br /&gt;I felt that this is a strong shampoo...if u read the instructions on the back, it tells you to use twice a week, each time twice....I am only using it once per wash....and twice in a week. And it is already more than sufficient to get rid of those irritating things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may cost about $19, however, u only need to use a small amount of it each time (about 1.5cm X 1cm)...for men (with short hair).....one bottle probably could last you for 1 or 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;Some commented that the price is slightly high..i don&#x27;t think so...if your scalp is itching u so bad that it is affecting your sleep, this is definitely a product for you, and a good investment too.</li>
    <li> Best pricing i could find and works very well</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my mom</li>
    <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve tried tar shampoo. .etc....etc..&lt;br /&gt;Of coure if I&#x27;d stay away from sugar junk food my head would do much better...lol....but with this shampoo. ....well...it doesn&#x27;t matter what I eat.&lt;br /&gt;Almost a bad thing this stuff works so good. ;)</li>
    <li> I have used DHS Zinc Shampoo for several years &amp; posted rave reviews... However, after my most recent purchase I was no longer receiving the results that I raved about... Today I called customer  &amp; was informed that, &amp;#34;...yes the formula has changed, but only the foaming agent. The active ingredients remain the same.&amp;#34; Baloney!!! The tingling effect that occurred after a couple of minutes of lathering no longer happens...With 3/wk use I am not receiving near the results that 2/wk use used to give me...  And, I fail to see why the warning to use no more than 3 times per week is no longer stated with only a foaming agent change in formulation... THIS IS NOT THE DHS ZINC SHAMPOO OF THE PAST!!! It does remain a step above the one that puts cologne in their product, but that is not what I paid for...</li>
    <li> This stuff saved my life.  I tried so many different things to get rid of my red, itchy scalp, but this really does the trick.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now and have had no problems.  Try it!</li>
    <li> This works quite well to stop excessive flaking.</li>
    <li> Best thing I have found to help with my scalp issues!!!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommded DHS products. This one did the trick. I use the tar shampoo occasionally, but this one smells better! The price is lower than at my CVS pharmacy due to my prime membership.</li>
    <li> Wonderful price for this product.  Have trouble finding it locally, and it is more expensive.</li>
    <li> Not easy to find locally, so we stock up on Amazon.  Totally treats her itchy scalp without drying out her hair.</li>
    <li> I have oily hair that leads to lots of painful zits on my scalp, so my doctor told me to buy this shampoo and I thought...\\&quot;ok, another one of those expensive , stincky medicated shampoos that will never work and will leave my hair ugly and dry\\&quot; to my wondeful surprise not only this shampoo smells really good, BUT it also treated the scalp problems really well and makes my hair incredibly beautiful and shinny....NO shampoo has ever made my hair so beautiful...DHS has...so it is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;BUY it, you will NOT regret!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING product! 100% RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> This stuff is good. It has even started new hair growing where there had been long lost hairs</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my hair dresser and it is wonderful.  No more scratchy scalp.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the first shampoo in years that has had any effect on my dandruff, and it has worked fantastically! So glad my Dermatologist gave me samples for it. Fairly expensive, and the price may determine whether I buy it continuously, but I will definitely consider this from now on. I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair since I no longer worry about a bunch of flakes falling out.</li>
    <li> This shampoo has helped to relieve the itch, even though I the doc says I don&#x27;t show signs of dandruff flakes.  Used regularly, it keeps the scalp itchy away.</li>
    <li> Works great for alleviating the symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis.  I used it daily (along with apple cider vinegar applied topically) until my symptoms started to subside and then down to once per week or so. My wife likes the smell too!</li>
    <li> Great Seller!!! Everything went perfect!!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product - not as intrusive as heavily medicated shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in between shampoos with Nizoral.&lt;br /&gt;Works great.</li>
    <li> This is the best over the counter product I have ever used for my chronic Seborrheic dermatitis.  However, I do feel the need to point out that Amazon is selling this product at a higher price than you can buy it direct from the manufacturer (where it sells for $17.25 roughly 11.5% cheaper).  I must also add that this is very very common for this product as I have never seen it sold for the same price (or less) than the manufacturer sells it for on any site or at any retail location.  So great product but it is cheaper elsewhere.  Having said that I seriously doubt this review will see the light of day but on the off chance it slips by I feel as an educated consumer it is my duty to tell others.</li>
    <li> Since we just received the DHS last week the effectiveness cannot be proven out.  I will be glad to re-evaluate &amp; rewrite another review once we have given the DHS shampoo enough time to prove itself.</li>
    <li> This was recommended 10 years ago by my dermatologist for my scalp as I had had an extreme allergic reaction.  I have used it ever since and it makes my hair very manageable, with no scalp problems.</li>
    <li> I ordered two bottles and received the products in about three days. Just as was promised.</li>
    <li> Works really well to clean your hair. I don&#x27;t really have dandruff issues, but my hair does get pretty oily. I use this about 2 - 3 times a week and takes care of the issue</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo if you have any issues with your scalp.  My Dr referred me to this and I used to find OTC but now I can not.  I&#x27;ve tried others as I hate buying online but I was forced to.  I bought the large size so it lasts a yr.  I mix mine half water half shampoo as you don&#x27;t need full strength.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for helping for avoid the awkward moment at the drug store counter when the clerk realizes that I have a grody scalp problem.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is pretty much the only thing that works for my dandruff.  I can get small bottles at my local CVS, but PharmaFrag gets me more for the same price as a small bottle at retail.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended it, and it has diminished the scaly, scabby patches on my scalp. I only use it when necessary.</li>
    <li> This is the best product on the market today. It really works and I&#x27;m glad I got a good deal through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great stuff works as advertised</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for years with excellent results.  Works for me when such shampoos as Head &amp; Shoulders and Selsun Blue did not.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair manageable.</li>
    <li> I use this from time to time.  I have very long hair and this keeps my scalp feeling great and clean.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist gave me a sample of this shampoo, and since it was so effective in controlling my scalp condition, I ordered it, and have been using it daily. It doesn&#x27;t have a &#x27;medicinal&#x27; odor, lathers up voluminously, and is effective.</li>
    <li> Used this shampoo for years.  Works great for my dandruff.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo that suds great. It has helped to improve my problem. It certainly does not smell mediciny at all, it has a pleasant smell but not too aromatic.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this shampoo because it&#x27;s cheaper than Zincplex and claims the same thing. It just doesn&#x27;t even compare. I still have an itchy scalp and have gone back to Zincplex. This just sits half empty in under the sink now. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my Dermatologist.  Do find I seem to be losing more hair using it though.</li>
    <li> We have terribly hard water and have tried many expensive shampoos, etc. This one really works! My husband said the first time he used it to get more because the itchiness on his scalp went away immediately. He has oily skin and hair, mine is dry and it works equally well for us both. Also, I have dyed hair and it doesn&#x27;t do any damage. Recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this! I use it every 2-3 days and it works great. No bad smell and controls my itchy/flaky scalp.</li>
    <li> The product does ease itchy scalp.  However the texture of my hair is not better so I will not re-order.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband to help with scaly&lt;br /&gt;skin on his head.  Seems to really help.  He has&lt;br /&gt;only used it for a couple of weeks, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> Color me surprised!  Outstanding results for me with first use.  Shampoo lathers very well and cleaned nicely.  Immediate relief from constant itching  and significant reduction in flaking first time around.  When used with DHS rinse, left my hair very soft and shiny.  Very pleased.  Will continue to use at least twice a week.</li>
    <li> Hair is very clean and only thing will cut my dandruff.  Much better than store bought. Now my black clothes don&#x27;t show &amp;#34;snow&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> My husband says this works great, has a nice smell and makes his hair feel clean. He has coarse, greasy hair. He also says a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> ONLY THAT CONTROLS MY DANDRUFF</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve battled with eczema for most of my life. Normal dandruff shampoos only make things worse. This is a fantastic OTC shampoo that will knock out the flakes, itchiness and irritation on your scalp. I use nearly everyday and I don&#x27;t have a need for topical steroid on my scalp to control my eczema. Go buy it!!</li>
    <li> I have mild dandruff and this product made it worse. Steer clear of this brand or end up pouring $18.00 down the drain. I&#x27;ll be going back to $3.99 store bought.</li>
    <li> Thanks Amazon for making DHS Zinc shampoo available.  Can&#x27;t get it in local stores any more and this is the ONLY product that works for my husband.</li>
    <li> My hubby was having problems with an acne like rash on his forehead and around his ears. This shampoo cleared up all the red bumps!</li>
    <li> It worked to remove six scalp scabs on my head. I massaged a tablespoon of shampoo on my scalp each day for two weeks and the scabs were gone. Keep your eyes closed because the shampoo will sting if it gets into your eyes. Neither apple cider vinegar nor tea tree oil would get rid of the scalp bumps, whereas DHS Zinc Shampoo cleared my scalp.</li>
    <li> I was using this Prescription stuff that smelled like sulfur for years until my Doc recommended this. This doesn&#x27;t leave your hair smelling bad, but works just as good (if not better). I&#x27;ve already run through pretty much everything you can buy at supermarkets with no luck - not only brands, but types like tar, zinc, etc. All other zinc shampoos that I&#x27;ve seen are only 1%, but his is 2%. I even tried washing every other day, but my hair is just too oily. If you have dandruff, buy this. (period)</li>
    <li> I use this in my hair and face everyday....works perfectly....convenient large size also...I recommend this product highly....can&#x27;t find it in stores</li>
    <li> This shampoo has been a game changer for me.  My dermatologist recommend it and I am so pleased with the results.  The price is no bad either.</li>
    <li> I live using this zinc shampoo- sometimes its the only thing that helps when my derm scalp condition rears its ugly head and i am at a complete loss of what to do anymore- it seems to get rid of the excess oil that so my scalp dosnt break out as it often does but i find i sometimes have to switch between nizarol ketaconazol type and zinc one to keep things in check otherwise i am prone to nasty scalp breakouts in winter months. The shampoo s hard for me to find locally sometimes.</li>
    <li> My son began taking isotretinoin for acne.  It dried out his skin and scalp so badly that the dandruff was awful!  His doctor recommended this shampoo and it has worked very well at controlling the dandruff.</li>
    <li> I finally found something that that really WORKS for my flaky scalp.  Thank you...</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that has seemed to fully clear up my mild-moderate seborrheic dermatitis. I have been using it almost daily for a few weeks now, and I noticed a difference after the first use. After less than a week, I had no itching or scaling left whatsoever. This is some good shampoo. I do need to use a little bit of conditioner after rinsing it out. It seems to knot my hair up. I have fine, straight hair, long length. If you&#x27;ve tried other products without luck, try this one.</li>
    <li> Everything isn&#x27;t perfect for everyone. This shampoo worked far better than prescription shampoos! It isn&#x27;t nearly as drying to the hair but it is somewhat which lost one star for me. That said, I do everything destructive to my hair possible. I color my hair, blow dry it and use a flat iron. I do use conditioner and a spray on conditioner for the iron. Over all my hair is not in bad condition but it is harder to keep up with using this shampoo. It does help A LOT.  The shampoo that I switched to is: [[ASIN:B007JT7AIK CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce]]  and the matching conditioner. Outstanding condition to my hair and scalp. Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Dermatologist has my husband order this! Works great!</li>
    <li> I have had bad dandruff on and off for my whole life. Recently I had an outbreak that I just couldn&#x27;t get under control with the regular dandruff shampoos (Head and Shoulders, Selson, etc). I tried this one based on the positive reviews, and it didn&#x27;t work like I hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few days of use saw my dandruff improve but not go away. I kept with it for a few weeks, and with daily use, it kept my dandruff reduced but still present. However, if I went even a single day without using it, my dandruff would come back in a major way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since found a shampoo that actually works for me: Nizoral AntiDandruff Shampoo (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AINMFAC). With the Nizoral shampoo, I only need to use it twice a week and I have zero dandruff. The rest of the time I use regular shampoo or can even skip washing my hair for a day with no ill effects.</li>
    <li> Constant dandruff issues.  Especially recently. Bought this product and followed the instructions. It is all I use now.  BLACK Is part of my wardrobe again.</li>
    <li> This stuff used to have 3% pyrithione zinc and they cut it back to 2%.  That&#x27;s a 33% reduction.  It doesn&#x27;t work like it used to, i&#x27;m looking for alternatives.  It used to be the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years based on an original recommendation from my dermatologist. It works quite well and doesn&#x27;t smell at all like all the charcoal-based others. It&#x27;s kind of a putty colored creamy color. Smell is non-offensive but nothing special. I don&#x27;t even use it for the full three minutes and never have flakiness when I use it. When I stop, that&#x27;s another story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, it&#x27;s the best stuff I&#x27;ve every used and won&#x27;t move away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note, they recently switched caps to a flip cap from the kind you poke in to pop up a little hole. If feels flimsier but it seems to be still intact after nearly using a full bottle.</li>
    <li> Doctor recommended this shampoo.  It works perfectly and my scalp has cleared up completely.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had a dry scalp for years and always went with head and shoulders and it seems to work pretty great.  i wanted a change and unfortunately whenever i use this instead of head and shoulders, my scalp gets really itchy again.  seems to work for others, but not for me!</li>
    <li> I have used Zinc shampoo, DHS, for years and find that I can get it with no shipping, so it was cheaper since I have not found it at the stores around here.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that helps with my seborrhea dandruff.</li>
    <li> EDIT: NEW FORMULA HAS SLS, have noticed that my scalp on the edge has been drier than usual since the formula change, also have floaters in my eyes now (unsure if related or coincidence). I loved this stuff, smh.&lt;br /&gt;I have seborrhea dermatitis and this is the only shampoo that I have found to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;Apply it and leave it on for a few minutes then rinse and your head will feel normal again!&lt;br /&gt;-Greatly reduces flaking, although i do still have a little where my hairline meets my forehead that I cant seem to figure out.&lt;br /&gt;-Eliminates itching!&lt;br /&gt; -No SLS</li>
    <li> Yeah for DHS with zinc shampoo. Cannot locate this locally anymore for some odd reason. Thanks to the company for supplying it, as many other sources were out of it and back-ordered--or very high priced. This WAS the real shampoo ---NOT a fake. Fair price and shipped on time.</li>
    <li> Bought this product because I have psoriasis on my scalp and really don&#x27;t like the prescribed lotion that I am supposed to apply to prevent breakouts. I have tried homeopathic remedies such as olive oil masques and coconut oil to alleviate the flaking. However, I knew my shampoo was important. Since I have purchased this product I have noticed a HUGE difference in my scalp, it doesn&#x27;t get dry the way it used to, I don&#x27;t have to worry about embarrassing white flakes in my dark brown hair. I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work on me since I have more than just a mild case of dandruff, I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this shampoo!</li>
    <li> I was recommended this by my dermatologist. It really helped me with my itchy, dry scalp, but I still had some dandruff here and there. And it was affordable, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> Recommended by dermatologists. Works very well.</li>
    <li> So glad to get this product so quickly.  Very effective product. I would recommend to any one with dandruff issues.</li>
    <li> After coming to the USA I had problems with the different kind of shampoos and my skull starts itching and my hair dried out.Mu doctor recommend DHS zink theraphy and now I am happy, my skull is more happy and my hair most happy. I really love this stuff. And from another review I read about the L&#x27;oreal shine and glossy conditioner. I reallz highly recommended this together.</li>
    <li> Hubby has fought dandruff for years and tried many different brands of dandruff shampoo. A Dr recommended this and it works great!</li>
    <li> I switched to this shampoo from Head &amp; Shoulders years ago and never looked back. The only complaint I have is that it&#x27;s mighty thick, and flows better out of the cap after replacing about 20% of the shampoo with water.</li>
    <li> Good lather, has not been real effective on my scalp condition. But hey, Doc says use it and Mom told me to follow Doc&#x27;s orders.</li>
    <li> very effective for seborrheal dermatitis</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Great for dandruff, leaves hair soft and manageable without drying it out.  I have used this product religiously for over 2 years.</li>
    <li> I use this once in a while when my itchy scalp starts to build up. One use takes care of the itching and build up for a while.</li>
    <li> Great product for my hair. I have repurchased it several times. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My son has been using Zinc Shampoo, DHS  for several years, and is very happy with the results. I will be purchasing this shampoo again.</li>
    <li> I have scabs, dandruff and itchiness on my scalp due to psoriasis. Although this product doesn&#x27;t eliminate the problem it controls and reduces it. It&#x27;s one of the best non-prescription shampoos available for the problem. I would say it keeps 95% of my scalp free of scabs or more. If I have an outbreak I need prescription medicine, but the rest of the time I use this.</li>
    <li> This is a product my husband has used for years, and will use no other.  Obviously he is well pleased with it.  Amazon has a good price, and since we buy three at a time, no shipping cost.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this shampoo on the recommendation of her dermatologist.  It&#x27;s an excellent shampoo and we received great service on our Amazon purchase.</li>
    <li> This product really helps my psoriasis.</li>
    <li> Works great! Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> This product seems to have disappeared from the shelves of our local pharmacies. It is one we&#x27;ve used for a considerable period of time. So glad to find it here!</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo originally for dandruff. What I found is that my hair also stopped falling out! I spoke to a dermatologist/hair transplant surgeon who told me that the zinc binds the DHEA (from testosterone) in the hair follicle and slows hair loss. Why isn&#x27;t this well known? All I know is that my hair looks great, feels good, my dandruff is gone and my hairbrush doesn&#x27;t have a ton of my hair in it anymore. For guys with short hair, this bottle lasts months, as a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It smells much better than those other shampoos and works better for me. I&#x27;ve tried many other shampoos for itchy flaky scalp and they only made it worse. I came across the reviews on this one and decided to give it a try. It worked wonders! My itchy scalp was not itching for a week straight! Pretty amazing for me.</li>
    <li> It does what I need it for so it is good.</li>
    <li> It worked, i was looking for a product with a good amount of zinc, this is the right one.</li>
    <li> This is a product I have used for several years.  The first shampoo that is effective with the dermatitis problem that I have.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> If you have oily hair and do not need added conditioner to your shampoo - this is the shampoo for you.  It was recommended to my son by his dermatologist due to having acne with very oily skin and hair.  It has worked very well and keeps his hair and complexion in great shape.  I am now using it as it seemed to make his hair look very healthy and is doing the same for mine.</li>
    <li> I have had Seborrheic dermatitis for the past 5 years and nothing has helped until I found this shampoo. I have been to many dermatologists and they have prescribed different shampoos and scalp solutions and nothing worked. This shampoo is a miracle!</li>
    <li> Been using this for quite a few years now and feel it is as good a product of this type as there is on the market without a prescription. Recently also purchased DHS Clear Shampoo. This also seems to be a really nice product.</li>
    <li> on my 2nd bottle this stuff works...</li>
    <li> Last fall I went to my dermatologist because I had been experiencing some scalp irritation.  Turns out it was a mild form of Rosacea causing me itching, etc.  He recommended this product and I&#x27;m so glad he did.  I also purchased the DHS conditioner but only use that a couple of times a week.  I&#x27;ve now been using this daily and it&#x27;s helped tremendously.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and love the convenience of buying it on amazon. Been using this product for about a year on the advice of my dermatologist. I wash my face with it - that&#x27;s right, my face. The Zinc in it helps to reduce my skin oil and has reduced my adult acne very nicely. I wash my face with it then leave it on for 10 minutes once a day. It&#x27;s hard to find at stores so amazon will be my new go to for this!</li>
    <li> excellent product clean scalp well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dandruff \\&quot;on &amp; off\\&quot; over the years, and I&#x27;ve tried a variety of anti-dandruff shampoos, including the old standby, \\&quot;Head &amp; Shoulders\\&quot; (made my hair frizzy), Neutrogena T-Gel (smells like tar), &amp; Selsun Blue (bizarre/artificial blue color!), but the DHS Zinc Shampoo is the only one that eradicated the dandruff with no negative \\&quot;side effects\\&quot;. (I figured out that part of the problem was that I was pulling my hair into a tight bun when it was still wet, so my wet hair stayed against my scalp for hours at a time, and apparently my scalp didn&#x27;t like that!) Regardless of the cause, this shampoo worked!</li>
    <li> It not only works, but is pleasant enough and easy to use. It&#x27;s not a complete cure, but regular use seems to stem the this dandruff like issue.</li>
    <li> This product used regularly will control your dandruff. If it can&#x27;t you need to see a dermatologist to help get control then DHS will maintain control.</li>
    <li> Nice creamy texture. Left my hair manageable. But didn&#x27;t solve my flaky scalp issues. Won&#x27;t buy again. Will just try another one till  I find what works.</li>
    <li> My daughter has &amp;#34;stinky hair&amp;#34; and acne in her hairline due to the oils and this world immediately to get rid of the oily stink and dries up the acne:)</li>
    <li> I have Seborrheic Dermatitis, which is basically really bad dandruff.  My scalp and parts of my face can become red and my scalp is ALWAYS very, very flaky.  We&#x27;re talking snow. &#x3D;)  I recently took my problem to a Dermatologist rather than my family doctor and he gave me a sample.  In 4 days my scalp was CLEAR.  This is the first time in 17 years (I&#x27;m 34) that I&#x27;ve not had dandruff to worry about.  I can touch my hair, scratch if I have an itch - and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the dandruff.  Some people may balk at the price but I am gladly paying the cost.  I stopped using the product when my sample ran empty.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores or pharmacies.  The dandruff came back within days.  Disclaimers:  I have used other dandruff medications, they did not work.  I use Ketaconazole (prescription) twice a week, which helped but did not clear my scalp.  Using both shampoos (Keta twice a week, DHS the remaining 5); my scalp stayed clear with only minor (very, very minor) outbreaks of flaking.</li>
    <li> Not alway easy to find in a store, but prime makes my life easy.  Great shampoo, no more scratching</li>
    <li> I originally started using this shampoo for mild hair loss as a result of vitamins. As that is no longer an issue, I&#x27;ve continued using it to help with occasional acne flare ups at my hairline. I&#x27;ll continue using it for that reason. It leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth as well.</li>
    <li> No issues with the DHS (I have SD). Is it as good as the otc Nizoral? Well, that would depend on which Nizoral one is referring to. The one I bought last year was way better than DHS but the otc Nizoral I just bought that is suddenly back in stock after a year long hiatus, well.....DHS is actually better.....yeah.....go figure. Ah well, you win some, you lose some. I&#x27;ll stick with the DHS. It&#x27;s not the greatest but it&#x27;s not bad either.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo to stop scaling and flaking. I dint have itch on my scalp but I scaled a lot. When I first used this product I thought it was what I was looking for. However after 2weeks scaling started to comeback making the shampoo in combatant.</li>
    <li> Was recommended to me by my Dermatologist and it works great.  This is now the only shampoo I use now.</li>
    <li> Recommended by our dermatologist. Works well.</li>
    <li> My 9 year old daughter has struggled with seborrheic dermatitis for years and nothing helped.  It was that thick yellow nasty kind that could make a person think your child has head lice.  This shampoo completely fixed the issue after just 3-4 washes.  We continue to have to use this shampoo every few weeks or the problem will come back.  Also, it makes her hair SMELL AMAZING!  I love it.  I will buy it again and stock up.</li>
    <li> I have used it for years.... off and on whenever I get the problem.... Itch relief right away, waxy build up on scalp &#x3D; so when you scratch - the waxy stuff lifts up under your nails? I am as clean as any human being can be but the itch I get mostly during hot summer... is almost fiery, burning... and the occasional pimple from sweating in the hair which is like one or two a summer.... but the itch and the scrapping of the scalp which produces that waxy film... this shampoo not only relieves the burn itch but it works fast! Cleans the dandruff/waxy dead skin cells etc... off.  I use it every time I wash my hair which is once a week or every 4 - 5 days. It can be a bit drying, but use a good conditioner ONLY on the hair away from the scalp don&#x27;t rub it into the scalp and make hair oily again. I only use it on the long hair...  T-GEL TAR shampoo is also GREAT! which you can use every other time you wash your hair which saves on this shampoo which is definitely OVERPRICED.... but it works. It does not damage hair or dry it to the point of breakage. If you color your hair use a protective color conditioner after all shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo, I have been using this for about 25 years, it really helps if you suffer with any scalp problems... It smells clean and gives lots of suds :)</li>
    <li> Works well to clear up stubborn dandruff if you follow the manufacturer&#x27;s directions.  My dermatologist recommended it and it worked after several weeks of use.  Five years later and still no dandruff.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is by far the best shampoo for my dandruff that I have EVER used. Yes it is a little pricey, but it is worth every penny. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I like the product, it leaves my hair feeling clean and managable.  There is no dandruff anymore.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo for dandruff on the market. They make a clarifying shampoo that is also good to use half the time. As the author of The Bachelor&#x27;s Bible, bachelorsbible.com, I researched thousands of products for men as a part of a chapter called The Best of Everything. I used this and was amazed at how well it handled my dandruff without stripping my hair. A little goes a long way and it smells better than the other medicated shampoos.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only thing I know that works on dandruff.  It was recommended by a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> Yes, excellent product</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo at the direction of my dermatologist for red, irritated and flakey scalp.  I have tried the tar shampoo (which is now is known to cause cancer with extended use) and antifungal shampoo to no avail. I do not like to wash my hair daily as it is dry and frizzy. With this shampoo, twice a week is effective for me. My dermatolologist states he also uses it.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that has healed my scalp in three years of trying different shampoos. This is my second bottle of this and it works great.</li>
    <li> This unfortunately didn&#x27;t do anything for flaking. All it did was dry out our hair. If you buy, make sure to follow it up with a very rich conditioner because it&#x27;s drying like dish detergent. We continue our search for a shampoo that truly eliminates flaking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had scalp issues for the last 20 years.  My flaking is controlled as long as I use the proper shampoo a few times a week.  I&#x27;ve used everything from brand names on the supermarket shelves to prescription strength, but I&#x27;ve had the best luck so far with the DHS products.  Even though it doesn&#x27;t have the heavy tar smell of some others it does a wonderful job.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Not this ia not workinv I buy 3 bottles more that $50dls and don&#x27;t work :( such of disappointment</li>
    <li> Used it for years with great results.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on a recommendation from my dermatologist. I live in the desert so it is always very dry and affects my skin. I tried many other products including dietary supplements and this product, alternating with a prescription shampoo I have is the only thing that made my scalp perfect like when I was a kid living near the ocean. The seller made the effort to pack the item nicely including a zip lock bag in case of leakage. Item was delivered fast. Highly recommend the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> I received this shampoo about a week ago and have been using it about every other day since (I have long hair, so I don&#x27;t wash it every day).  I have seborrhaic dermatitis, so my scalp is pretty scaly and sometimes can flake, which is pretty awkward and embarrassing.  Anyway.  I&#x27;ve tried Lush products (I generally prefer to use natural products on my hair, so I started there), Neutrogena T-Gel, but nothing worked.  I&#x27;ve had this problem severely for over a year, and I was kinda losing hope that I might fix it.  My mother has the same problem and went to a dermatologist, who recommended this shampoo.  It has helped a LOT.  My head itches slightly through the day still, but nothing compared to what it was.  The skin is feeling much smoother and less cracked on my scalp, and I&#x27;m just incredibly grateful that this product worked.  I will absolutely continue to use, but maybe go down to once or twice a week (it dries my hair out a little, but nothing that my deep conditioner hasn&#x27;t been able to repair).  Note: if you have colored hair, I would only recommend using this once a week, regardless of how bad your condition has gotten.  My hair is back to its natural color, but I&#x27;m noticing a slight dullness at the roots that wasn&#x27;t there before (also part of the reason I&#x27;m probably going to go to once per week).</li>
    <li> The shampoo has a nice thick foam, smells pretty good, not horrible like some Zinc shampoo&#x27;s.  Leaves my hair feeling smooth and clean.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> My wife and i thought we would try a different shampoo and selected this one at random. We both nave dry itche scalp. Now gone. We tried them all over the years an feel this is the best. Try it you will like it.</li>
    <li> I have used other shampoos for dry scalp and none compare to DHS.&lt;br /&gt;DHS gets rid of dry scabby areas on your scalp in as little as 2 treatments.</li>
    <li> This is a shampoo that I use all the time and it takes care of my dandruff and itchy scap!  My dermatogolist recommended and i am glad he did!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo seems to be effective for the treatment of scalp dermatitis , however it is very expensive if required to be used&lt;br /&gt;daily.</li>
    <li> The only product that has stopped flaking , itching or dryness of the scalp for my 13 yr old daughter &amp; myself. hair looks &amp; shells  great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used DHS Zinc Shampoo for years for chronic dry, itchy scalp. It was recommended by a dermatologist and is by far the best dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried. Tip: If you wash your hair while in the shower, leave the shampoo in your hair while you wash your body, then rinse it out and lather and rinse a second time. Once you have the problem under control, the second lathering can usually be skipped. I use DHS every other day in the winter because I live in a dry climate, which seems to make my itchy scalp problem worse. DHS does dry the hair and make it flyaway, so follow up with a really good conditioner. I like TRI conditioner--that green minty stuff that was popular a few years ago. It&#x27;s still available online, but you probably won&#x27;t find it in the stores any more.</li>
    <li> Great Zinc shampoo, does  a nice job of eliminating dandruff and itching. Helps also if you suffer from dermatitis by stopping the itching on the forehead. Great buy.</li>
    <li> Just what the dermatologist recommended.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s dermatologist recommended this 2% zinc shampoo to try to control the very nasty thick scaly patches he gets on his head. He was rotating this with tar shampoo, but the smell of the tar shampoo was so strong I almost had to move out of the house - or send him out for 7 hours or so....LOL.  Even with that schedule the nasty scaly patches would return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is now using this zinc shampoo every day and seldom gets a new scaly patch on his head. It doesn&#x27;t work if he doesn&#x27;t use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main objection to this, and other commercial shampoos, is that they all contain several carcinogenic ingredients, not the least of which are the \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; and coloring that are really unnecessary. The perfume in the tar shampoo makes the smell even worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this is the only non prescription 2% zinc shampoo I could find and the doctor did recommend it............for what that is worth.</li>
    <li> Have used this shampoo about a month and am very pleased that it has no strong odor, plus it seems to work for the itching and dermatitis.  Only one suggestion, really need to use a conditioner after this.</li>
    <li> Very good, has been my only answer to my dandruff problem.</li>
    <li> Received in good shape, recommended by my dermatologist, seems to be working on skin fungus.</li>
    <li> I have had issues with scalp irritations my whole life.  I have tried product after product with no success with the exception of the DHS products.  The DHS products are the only ones that have worked for me.  I alternate the clear and zinc shampoos daily and also use the conditioner/rinse. I have rarely had any scalp irritations since I have been using the DHS products.</li>
    <li> Really does a fantastic job at reducing scalp irritation and inflammation. Neutral scent.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my wife at her request. She was suffering with dry, itching scalp and her sister told her about the product.According to my wife it has work great and relived the dry,itchy scalp problem she was suffering from. She said that this will be her shampoo from now on.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo.  I would have liked to know the ingredients before making the purchase.  Only after it arrived did I learn that it contains an ingredient to which I am allergic.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the last 10+ years.  It restores your spliting hair.  It is not harsh to your scalp and and has a decent fragrance.  But you must use it with a conditioner.</li>
    <li> The Zinc Shampoo itself is just fine, but the bottle was leaking and the plastic bag it was wrapped in also leaked - unfortunately all over the book I ordered in the same shipment.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, funny colour...works well. Prevents and heals the Rosacea issues. Reduces the scalp oilness and greatly reduces the itching, that is Rosacea.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have searched and searched for this. Very few places, carry this shampoo in this size. I do not know what causes Rosacea, or Psoriasis, could be nerves or diet or both. Who knows, but I know that htis works and is worth every penny. One 16 oz. bottle, lasts me about 1 .5 months, it lathers well. There is no need to use a lt, just a tiny spot  of shampoo, will clean and  relieve the symptoms, very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it, it&#x27;s even mild on the hair and skin. Stings the eyes, but most medicated shampoos, do that.</li>
    <li> After trying several prescription shampoos/treatments without success for extreme scalp itching this seems to be helping and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out like the others. Each week I notice less itching.</li>
    <li> Good product. Recommended by dermatologist. The samples provided proved up to the description which prompted me to buy for regular use.&lt;br /&gt;We have two swimmers in the family.</li>
    <li> My husband has bad dandruff. Nothing really helps except this Shampoo.</li>
    <li> its ok for what I bought it for. but it doesn&#x27;t completely help to get rid of the dandruff problem once its really bad. I use it on my daughter and if I don&#x27;t help her to massage it on the scalp it don&#x27;t work. so I just take a little of it while her hair is dry and add to the spots that needs to be treated. I then wet the hair and message it onto the scalp and it works better that way. I however still can&#x27;t get rid of my dandruff problem, but it does work on my seborrheic  dermatitis. update: I still haven&#x27;t gotten rid of my  daughter&#x27;s dandruff problem but I did get to manage my seborrheic dermatitis. I also made my son use in on his acne prone skin, because he has a really bad case and nothing the doctors gave them worked, this has actually cleared his face up big time. Might not be what he needed but nothing else had worked and using this for a month my sons face has actually came out. Will buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is the best zinc shampoo i&#x27;ve found</li>
    <li> I normally use over the counter (OTC) products that contain tar for my scalp.  I even use Head and Shoulders.  I decided to try this out because it was a larger bottle and I thought it would last longer than the one I usually buy in the store.  This didn&#x27;t work for me.  I have Seborrhea Dermatitis on my scalp.  It has flare ups especially when it&#x27;s colder outside and everything is dry.  I used the entire bottle but didn&#x27;t find any relief.  I will go back to buying the OTC stuff that works.  I may have to buy it more often as it&#x27;s a much smaller quantity but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for 15 years. I used to have dandruff and no longer have any. I use it twice a week, and regular shampoo the other days. Nice fragrance, it really works! As a matter of fact when I received it my friend said \\&quot;I didn&#x27;t know you have dandruff.\\&quot; I don&#x27;t, anymore!</li>
    <li> When you have terribly painful scalp issues this product may help you as it did me.Soothing and leaves your hair and scalp fresh and clean.Does not sting at all.</li>
    <li> After only 3-4 times of using this shampoo the itchiness and pain of my scalp was gone. I&#x27;m very happy with the result. I also, recommended this shampoo to my mother who also had itchy and painful scalp now, her scalp feels great too.</li>
    <li> I am in my early twenties and have been suffering from seborrheic dermatitis since I was a teen. This shampoo isn&#x27;t a permanent solution, however it does provide good relief when it comes to an itchy scalp. I saw the dandruff reduce too after using it for around 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> Got my order quickly and love the shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo most of my life as I have a very dry scalp due to Hashimoto&#x27;s disease. I can&#x27;t go with out it and to find is on Amazon was golden! I will continue to order from this seller.</li>
    <li> Awesome if you have folliculitis! The zinc is perfect at calming down that inflammation. No clue how it works with dry scalp problems, though.</li>
    <li> Some years ago my old dermatologist recommended this shampoo for dandruff - and also to use as a face wash in the shower. It has reduced dandruff to the point of being a non-issue, and I like the way my hair looks and feels. After the old Dr. retired, the new dermatologist said my scalp looked really good at our first appointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a beard from early Dec to mid-May and used the shampoo on it. I believe it really made my face feel more comfortable - no itchiness or flaking at all for me. NONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like this is far, far superior to any shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried and will remain loyal for life. Or until they go out of business or discontinue it. Yes, it&#x27;s pricier than over the counter stuff but I think it&#x27;s well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it works as great for you as it has for me!!!</li>
    <li> Did a good job cleaning my hair....took a little longer to clear the scalp bumps I occasionally get.Good job fighting dandruff.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a number of years. This is a great shampoo for dandruff control. I have not usually seen it in any stores on the shelf, but can often be obtained by the pharmacist. This is a much easier way to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for some scalp problems. A little bit goes a long way so don&#x27;t let the price scare you.</li>
    <li> Really helped stop the itchy scalp !</li>
    <li> Shampoo works great! First product I have ever used that really helps with my chronic dermatitis. I highly recommend this shampoo!</li>
    <li> This product (including the tar type) is simply great if you have skin conditions, regardless weighed it&#x27;s on your head or anywhere else on your body. Every dermatoglist I&#x27;ve been to asks what shampoo I use and all say the same, DHS is the best and it can also be used as a body soap, if needed.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job in controlling dandruff.  Other brands I have tried  did not work.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo for my heavy dandruff. As long as I use this shampoo it&#x27;s gone. if I stop for a few days or forget it on a long trip dandruff gets fierce. This stuff is great.</li>
    <li> A dermatologist diagnosed my skin condition as seborrheic dermatitis many years ago. He recommended DHS pyrithione zink (2%) shampoo as treatment. I have used it ever since &amp; found that it is the only shampoo that keeps the itching, flaking skin &amp; redness at bay. The problem is that none of the usual retailers in my area carry it any more. I was happy to find it on Amazon. There are other companies that use pyrithione zink in their formulas, but only at 1% or less. I use it twice a week until its under control &amp; then once every week or so. It works for me![[ASIN:B0046JOT4O Zinc Shampoo, Dhs 16oz]]</li>
    <li> My hair looks great.  It does help control many of the problems with seborrheic dermatitis. The itching and flakes were much better and the product seems gentle to the scalp.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the tar smell of other shampoos.  Dr. recommended this. Suds really well and leaves the hair clean.</li>
    <li> I have scalp folliculitis and although this shampoo is not a cure it does give me considerable relief from itching that I haven&#x27;t been able to find in any other shampoo.</li>
    <li> Oh Thank God for this stuff. My scalp has been a little B for the last 4 years and the medicated stuff I was given really didn&#x27;t work compared to this. The first time I used this my scalp didn&#x27;t itch the next day. That hasn&#x27;t happened in months.  Couldn&#x27;t recommend this more. SERIOUSLY</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of shampoos over the years for my psoriasis and nothing clears it up like DHS. Am so glad I found it!!</li>
    <li> It really help my scalp . It gets off the all dandruff from only one application !! Highly recommend it !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different shampoos to help with the seborrhea on my scalp, and this one is definitely the best.</li>
    <li> My wife has a scalp condition which the doctor prescribed her to use Zinc Shampoo and DHS works great for her. She will continue to buy!!!</li>
    <li> Found this to replace head &amp; shoulders very expensive 2% zinc shampoo that they discontinued. Keeps my head clear and NOTHING else will. Works so well I tried to quit using it thinking I just had an allergy or something that had passed. A week or so later it started to itch again. Been using it for years now and am quite happy Amazon started selling it and with \\&quot;Prime\\&quot; shipping.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> For dandruff and balding this is a great product to slow hair loss better than keto and good in conjunction with minoxidil propecia avodart and retina</li>
    <li> I have a very dry scalp and some eczema on my face, and I use this product to wash my hair, scalp, and face.  Very pleased with the results.  Also very satisfied with the delivery speed in particular and the customer service in general.</li>
    <li> My sister first introduced me to this product. I use it as a shampoo as well as a soap and I find my skin just loves it.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist gave me samples, for an itchy scalp.  Works wonders.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommend this for a scalp irritation.  So far it is working perfectly.  It only takes a small amount for an application.</li>
    <li> 5 months ago the itch began. I believe this was do to anxiety and stress in my life. I tried products like tree tea oil, head and shoulders, olive oil treatments, apple cider vinegar- these treatments relived me for a day or two. The itch became more intense and then I noticed the dandruff. I have never experienced this before. I didn&#x27;t care so much about dandruff, it was the itch that was so severe, I was completely miserable. 2 weeks ago, I went to my local pharmacy store to see if I can find another remedy. I picked up a bottle of this stuff and I&#x27;m soooo glad I did. It saved me. From the first time I shampood, I noticed a difference. Hardly no itching. I have used this every two days. As of right now,, I have very little dandruff and the itching is hardly there at all. I can only expect to be 100% better in a couple more shampoos. Ahhhh....what a relief!!!!!</li>
    <li> The zinc shampoo does work very well as my Dermatologist said it would.  You can&#x27;t ask for more than that!</li>
    <li> Worked good...my son has the concern with dandruff.  This really helps.  He switches from this to the DHS &#x27;clear&#x27; shampoo.</li>
    <li> The only thing that works for my cradle cap, aka seborrhea dermatitis.  Selsun Blue, Nizoral and others like it don&#x27;t really control my condition as this does with regular use.  I wish I found it many years ago.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
    <li> I started using this a week ago, and my scalp barely itches anymore.  This is a very effective product, but smells bad and may be harsh on hair and scalp.  I fix this by mixing some of the shampoo with a generous amount Deva Curl No Poo when I use it, so it treats my dandruff without drying out my hair or scalp.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews...but I had to. I have sever stress induced dermatitis on my scalp...it&#x27;s always a postpartum thing but with my third it&#x27;s been awful. I tried everything. T gel, T sal, a bunch of others. Nothing touched it. This stuff, after 2 washes, cleared about 50% of the build up and itch. It&#x27;s got no smell, and fairly gentle. I think within a week or so I will feel much better. I scrub hard at the tough spots and then use a really thick conditioner. Get this if you have stubborn dermatitis on your scalp!</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo. My skin is very sensitive and can not use almost all shampoo in the market. I spend years to find a good shampoo and this is the one I need. I do feel comfortable with this shampoo. My husband has very oily hair and his hair became less and less. This shampoo helps him control the oil pretty good. Since he start to use this shampoo, he grow more and more new hair. We both love the shampoo and will continue use it.</li>
    <li> zinc fights inflammatory scalp, you can buy head and shoulders shampoo that also contains zinc, but DHS has 2% zinc vs head and shoulders with just 1%.  zinc is also a key ingredient for fighting flakes.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t help my scalp Psoriasis at all.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this because 1% zinc pyrithione works well for dandruff, but the shampoo we were using (one of the few that actually smells good) has been discontinued.  This was the only other shampoo I could find with zinc, (although it was double the percentage at 2%), that didn&#x27;t contain sulfur.  I actually used it today for my dog, who has developed seborrhea and has begun to smell like dirty sneakers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers very well and smells nice, and it rinses clean.  And my dog, at least temporarily, no longer smells bad.</li>
    <li> Does what it promises !</li>
    <li> Did not work for me.  My dermatologist, however, has switched me to DHS SAL.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. My husband&#x27;s dermatologist recommended a zinc shampoo and I always buy this</li>
    <li> This product works wonders!</li>
    <li> it helps with my scalp condition</li>
    <li> This shampoo does what it should.  It cleans and gets rid of dandruff.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with finding a solution to dandruff for years and prior to using this product, my scalp would often itch due to flaking. This is the only dandruff shampoo that addresses and most imporantly, solves all of those problems. It also leaves my hair very soft.</li>
    <li> Great product. Delivered as promised. This is my 2nd purchase of this shampoo so I got two bottles this time.</li>
    <li> Effective--prevents scalp inflammation.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for years for something that will help my female hair loss.  Nothing (I mean nothing, including Rogaine, minoxidil, shampoos, treatments, herbs, vitamins, supplements) has worked.  I read that the zinc in this shampoo will bind the DHEA (from testosterone) on the scalp and in the hair follicle, which will slow hair loss.  I do not have dandruff or any other scalp condition, other than the hair loss.  This product not only slowed my hair loss to a normal level (just a few hairs in the shower instead of a handful), but my hair is also very shiny.  The product is creamy and lathers very well so you do not have to use much.  I do sometimes alternate with another shampoo as it can be drying (evidenced by more tangles in my hair than usual).</li>
    <li> I like this. It works and its a big bottle. I do find you have to use your nails when you are shampooing to take off the dead skin.</li>
    <li> Prescribed by dermatologist and difficult to find in local stores.  This worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD FOR MY SCALP. I CAN&#x27;T USE IT. i FORGOT TO LEAVE  a review earlier. When I use it, my scalp starts to inflame or burn. I tried it different times but same effect&lt;br /&gt;Not Recommended.</li>
    <li> Good results. Doctor recommended the shampoo. I use it to wash my face every day and  on my hair and body 2 times a week.</li>
    <li> This is expensive shampoo and I have not been able to see any difference between it and Selsun Blue, which is much cheaper.</li>
    <li> This product, out of about 8 different other products including prescription strength, is the ONLY one that worked for my daughter!  Everyone&#x27;s scalp and physiology is different, so this may not work for you...but if you don&#x27;t try it, you&#x27;ll never know.</li>
    <li> Works well, as advertised. I am pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using DHS Zinc shampoo for some time now and it is the only product that really controls my flakes.  I love the stuff but it is difficult to find in the stores so I order from Amazon regularly.  The product was delivered without delay, was well packaged and all is good.</li>
    <li> I received it OK. I just began using it per doctor&#x27;s recommendation.It irritated my scalp at the beginning. I use it now only every few days. We will see....</li>
    <li> If you suffer from seborrheic dermatitis, please consider trying at least one bottle of this particular Zinc Shampoo. I&#x27;ve had scalp dermatitis since my teens and have used several types of treatments - coal tar, hydrocortisone, rosemary oil, tea tree oil, salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide and zinc pyrithione. They all worked reasonably but I never continued using them because of the typical issues associated with treatment shampoos: they dried out my hair, left it feeling waxy, and smelled AWFUL. I generally only use natural haircare products, but out of curiousity I gave this product a try. It doesn&#x27;t contain sodium laureth sulfate, which most mainstream shampoos use (this is what usually causes excessive dryness/breakage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo has everything I&#x27;m looking for in a dermatitis treatment. It has a gentle smell, good lather, and leaves no sticky residue after washing. You can&#x27;t underestimate the importance of its smell - it doesn&#x27;t leave that horrible, chemical medication smell so it means I can just use this shampoo and a conditioner without an additional shampoo to get rid of the stench. It cleared up current patches and prevents future ones from occurring. I used this every day for the first week, and then moved on to using it every two days without any issues. It&#x27;s gentle enough to use around the ears as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve been displeased with previous dermatitis treatments, I really recommend that you try this product and use it daily. You&#x27;ll know you made the right decision the moment you pop the cap open and lather it in your hair without any stickiness or nasty smells! If for some reason this product doesn&#x27;t work for treating your dermatitis, I would recommend you try a product with any of the treatments I&#x27;ve listed above, just be sure to avoid sodium laureth sulfate. Good luck! :)</li>
    <li> After reading reviews on this I ordered 2 bottles. So far exactly what I expected. Very good product, seems to work as adverised and would recommend it. It has started to control my condition, and I hope that in the next few weeks, I will see a much improved scalp.</li>
    <li> I really like the product for it&#x27;s intended purpose.  Only criticism is that the ink/paint on the packaging begins to flake off after just a few uses leaving black specks in the shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every other dandruff shampoo and nothing seemed to work.  If it did work it would only go on for a couple of weeks and then the flakes and itching would come back.  This stuff has completely gotten the itch gone and flakes are pretty much non-existent.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 20-year-old male who has been living with dandruff since around the age of 13. My dandruff from age 13 to about age 18 was never severe, so I never felt the need to purchase a product like this. When I turned 18, I started to steer towards \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or \\&quot;organic\\&quot; hair products. I tried many products that included tea tree oil, coconut oil, salicylic acid, etc... Around that same time, my dandruff became more severe until I ended up with what I call, a mild case of S.D., though I was never diagnosed by a dermatologist. I had flaky, yellowish, and scaly build-up that I would always pick at and it itched very bad. I came across DHS Zinc shampoo and WOW. I have only been using it for a week, but after the second day, I could already tell and feel a difference. The build-up went down about 90%. I am following the instructions on the bottle, leaving the shampoo in for approx. 5 minutes. I follow up with the DHS Conditioning Rinse, and my hair has never felt nor looked better. It seems to make my hair less oily as well. FYI - I have shorter, thick black hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another benefit, is that the DHS Zinc Shampoo seems to have cleared up those hairline pimples we all get.</li>
