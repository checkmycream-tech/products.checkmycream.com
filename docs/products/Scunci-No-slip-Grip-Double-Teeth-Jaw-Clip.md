### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>VERY NICE AND STURDY TOO</li>
      <li>But then one day I stepped on it or something and broke it for good.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find these in stores any more, so I get them from Amazon!</li>
      <li>I LOVE these jaw clips!  </li>
      <li>I really liked this clip.  </li>
      <li>,  the item itself is good quality and nice, just not the right size.</li>
      <li>Not up to Amazon standards, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
      <li>clip also lines up with your skull better to prevent a lot of movement.</li>
      <li>When I drop it too many times I&#x27;ll get another.</li>
      <li>This is a good clip &amp; holds very well.  </li>
      <li>This clip is strong, but impractical.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a small clip, it should hold more hair, but the strong spring is nice.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine, the teeth inside really helped so the clip didn&#x27;t move &amp; fall out.  </li>
      <li>Sturdy but nothing special.</li>
      <li>[bought on Amazon], brown tortoise, &amp; a really cool speckled tortoise -</li>
      <li>This is the best clip ever for thick hair.</li>
      <li>These are so compact, sleek, &amp; cool looking, &amp; they really hold my hair up all day in a great French twist-like look.</li>
      <li>I have really fine hair and most of these products just fall out of my hair or pull on individual strands painfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Cover started losing its golden color within a month.</li>
      <li>This clip has an inner clip that helps hold my very fine hair in place....</li>
      <li>&amp; hopefully Amazon will get very available color/pattern back in</li>
      <li>but I very much wanted a replacement.</li>
      <li>I just purchased several more of them....</li>
      <li>TERRIBLE...broke the first time I used it.....</li>
      <li>After a bit of searching I found the exact one.</li>
      <li>Extra cheaply made - broke with first use!  </li>
      <li>The look of the clip is also nice because it is not huge or elaborate, just plain, clean lines.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a hair clip large enough to secure my hair in place.  </li>
      <li>In addition to the teeth found on the edge of the clip (as most clips have), there is a second set of smaller teeth inside.</li>
      <li>I suspect this has more to do with its strange design of an inner set of teeth than with the company.</li>
      <li>This clip works great for long or thick hair, holds up your hair all day.</li>
      <li>The outer ones work fine, but don&#x27;t expect the &amp;#34;double grip&amp;#34; to work, since now I only have 1 tooth of the inner grips.</li>
      <li>I have tried many other products but keep coming back to these.  </li>
      <li>Not sure about long term durability since I only bought a week ago but for now... Amazing!</li>
      <li>The spring is really strong, and the extra teeth are a good idea, but the design is bad.</li>
      <li>I think it would be better for someone who doesn&#x27;t have thick hair.</li>
      <li>The thing was not comfortable, did not hold as much hair as most of my other hair claws of this size, and fell apart after using it twice!!</li>
      <li>The only clip I have used so far that doesn&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s grip and fall out of place!</li>
      <li>(now that my hair is about five inches past my shoulders) but for the price, they&#x27;re worth the wear</li>

<li> I kept using it after half of the inner clip fell off.</li>
<li> You do have to be careful that you don&#x27;t break any of the teeth on them, but with a little practice and care these clips should last a long time.  </li>
<li> The inner grips started breaking after a few uses.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d stick with other hair claws.</li>
<li> other clips just dont compare they</li>
<li> Definitely not worth the money nor the effort.</li>
<li> These are the only ones I buy and work in my thick hair.</li>
<li> I have one ea in black</li>
<li> Held hair tightly for two days, then broke at the hinge.</li>
<li> this clip is a steal i have thick long heavy hair</li>
<li> These are the only thing that hold my thick hair in place!  </li>
<li> Broke with first use! :(</li>
<li> Opening the clip all the way is difficult, and the extra teeth leave little room for hair.</li>
<li> My hair is past my shoulders and thick, so I need a longer one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Why are they so hard to find?</li>
<li> The only problem I had is, 2 out of 3 have broken after only using it a couple of times ~ very disappointing.  </li>
<li> r thick durable n appeasing to the eye</li>
<li> Ugly brown colour too - not black.  </li>
<li> The clips were all too small or the teeth were wrong.</li>
<li> Still hasn&#x27;t broken for me, I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 months already</li>
<li> My hair is medium length but very thin, twisting it up, the clip won&#x27;t hold all my hair even without doubling it up.</li>
<li> A disappointment for what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
<li> Bad</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> TERRIBLE...broke the first time I used it.....</li>
    <li> Before these came along, I could only get my hair up to stay in octopus clips. These are so compact, sleek, &amp; cool looking, &amp; they really hold my hair up all day in a great French twist-like look. Why are they so hard to find? I have one ea in black [bought on Amazon], brown tortoise, &amp; a really cool speckled tortoise - now I can&#x27;t find that this pattern anywhere. What if I break it? Hopefully Scunci still makes these!! - &amp; hopefully Amazon will get very available color/pattern back in [they&#x27;re out of the only one they carried]...sigh</li>
    <li> Broke with first use! :( Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Broke the second time I used it! Definitely not worth the money nor the effort. Suspect there is a defect which is why it is being unloaded here. Not up to Amazon standards, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these jaw clips!  I&#x27;ve got long hair, and these are the ONLY clips that will hold my hair up without eventually loosening up.  You do have to be careful that you don&#x27;t break any of the teeth on them, but with a little practice and care these clips should last a long time.  I just purchased several more of them....because I leave them all over the house!</li>
    <li> Still hasn&#x27;t broken for me, I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 months already</li>
    <li> This is a good clip &amp; holds very well.  I think it would be better for someone who doesn&#x27;t have thick hair.</li>

    <li> Extra cheaply made - broke with first use!  Ugly brown colour too - not black.  Don&#x27;t bother with this clip.</li>
    <li> These are the only thing that hold my thick hair in place!  I have tried many other products but keep coming back to these.  They seem to break quicker than they used to though (now that my hair is about five inches past my shoulders) but for the price, they&#x27;re worth the wear I get out of them.</li>
    <li> I really liked this clip.  My hair is very fine, the teeth inside really helped so the clip didn&#x27;t move &amp; fall out.  The only problem I had is, 2 out of 3 have broken after only using it a couple of times ~ very disappointing.  I had purchased these same clips last year &amp; they lasted a lot longer.</li>
    <li> This clip has an inner clip that helps hold my very fine hair in place....</li>
    <li> This clip works great for long or thick hair, holds up your hair all day.</li>
    <li> The only clip I have used so far that doesn&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s grip and fall out of place! Not sure about long term durability since I only bought a week ago but for now... Amazing!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a hair clip large enough to secure my hair in place.  My hair is past my shoulders and thick, so I need a longer one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is advertised as being 6 inches in length. After I received it,  it was much smaller,  the length is only 3.5 inches.  A disappointment for what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;But,  the item itself is good quality and nice, just not the right size.</li>
    <li> this clip is a steal i have thick long heavy hair other clips just dont compare they r thick durable n appeasing to the eye</li>
    <li> This clip is strong, but impractical. The spring is really strong, and the extra teeth are a good idea, but the design is bad. Opening the clip all the way is difficult, and the extra teeth leave little room for hair. My hair is medium length but very thin, twisting it up, the clip won&#x27;t hold all my hair even without doubling it up. It&#x27;s not a small clip, it should hold more hair, but the strong spring is nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim at a drugstore once. Then I used it every day for about a year. I dropped it a lot. I kept using it after half of the inner clip fell off. But then one day I stepped on it or something and broke it for good. I went back to find another like it and I couldn&#x27;t find anything at a number of drugstores. The clips were all too small or the teeth were wrong. I have really fine hair and most of these products just fall out of my hair or pull on individual strands painfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I had no clue what the product was called anymore but I very much wanted a replacement. After a bit of searching I found the exact one. When I drop it too many times I&#x27;ll get another.</li>
    <li> These are the only ones I buy and work in my thick hair.</li>
    <li> Cover started losing its golden color within a month. Sturdy but nothing special. Will not buy another one again. Bad</li>
    <li> This is the best clip ever for thick hair. In addition to the teeth found on the edge of the clip (as most clips have), there is a second set of smaller teeth inside. These smaller teeth help prevent hair from slithering out of the clip. I have layered hairstyle, but with this clip, I can twist it, clip it, for all day hold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clip also lines up with your skull better to prevent a lot of movement. The curved teeth edge improve the hold at the scalp level.The look of the clip is also nice because it is not huge or elaborate, just plain, clean lines.  I can&#x27;t find these in stores any more, so I get them from Amazon!</li>
    <li> The inner grips started breaking after a few uses. The outer ones work fine, but don&#x27;t expect the &amp;#34;double grip&amp;#34; to work, since now I only have 1 tooth of the inner grips.</li>
    <li> VERY NICE AND STURDY TOO</li>
