### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
      <li>Perfect.</li>
      <li>Good product and works in Simplehuman pump, but is WAY overpriced online.</li>
      <li>This is probably my very FAVORITE dial scent ever.</li>
      <li>It did not make any kind of suds when you tried to wash your hands.  </li>
      <li>This one is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t have a lingering strong perfume scent.</li>
      <li>We love Dial Antibacterial.</li>
      <li>I love the foam, the cleaning and the antibacterial qualities of Dial Foamy hand soap.  </li>
      <li>So easy to order it.</li>
      <li>Best scent ever but not worth buying online.</li>
      <li>If you like Dial&#x27;s &#x27;&#x27;Spring Water&#x27;&#x27; scent this is both a hidden treasure source and a very good bargain!</li>
      <li>Finally a antibacterial hand soap for a great price.</li>
      <li>A very economical way to go.  </li>
      <li>I used this as a refill for all my original pump bottles.  </li>
      <li>The larger refill size was perfect for me as I was my hands frequently.</li>
      <li>SINCE THE BOTTLE IS SUCH A GOOD SIZE</li>
      <li>ITS REALLY WORTH</li>
      <li>I am a person with a very sensitive immune system and even more sensitive to fragrances.</li>
      <li>This is available at Walmart for less than $4 defiantly worth the drive to that store</li>
      <li>Besides the ridiculously high price, the bottle i received was not sealed and the soap doesn&#x27;t lather.  </li>
      <li>Does not lather like soft soap!</li>
      <li>But, finding this ultra-pleasant and extra clean smelling version in refill bottles locally is a virtually futile joust.  </li>
      <li>I try to use eco-friendly products as much as possible, but have found the use of essential oils in many aggravates my immune issues and some products have a tendency to loose their freshness.</li>
      <li>The bottle arrived with about 2 inches of dust on it like it was old as dirt.  </li>
      <li>The bottle was not cracked, but the screw-on top was a bit loose, and some of the soap had leaked out to slightly coat the inside plastic packaging.</li>
      <li>but all in all I realize it is well worth the trouble</li>

<li> THE MONEY SPENT SAVES IN THE LONG RUN BIG TIME</li>
<li> This is the second time I have purchased this hand soap, and the second time that there was slight leakage from the bottle during shipping.</li>
<li> DOESN&#x27;T DRY OUT YOUR HANDS LIKE SOME SOAPS</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this product from a local store in the individual bottles for a few months now in our kitchen and master bath.</li>
<li> Definitely NOT worth the purchase.  </li>
<li> i wouldn&#x27;t doubt it was watered down.  </li>
<li> it doesnt lather, appears to be watered down and was not sealed when it arrived.  </li>
<li> I went to the store and cost was much less ounce per ounce.</li>
<li> Nothing was damaged, and I would not consider the amount serious enough to call it a waste, but I did have to rinse off the bottle before using it to refill the dispensers and putting it in the cupboard.</li>
<li> Hard to find in the stores around here.</li>
<li> Watery and just not effective in cleaning hands.</li>
<li> As a result I find it very difficult to find in local stores (and expensive to find and buy online)</li>

    <li> this is not dial soap. it doesnt lather, appears to be watered down and was not sealed when it arrived.  DO NOT ORDER.</li>
    <li> This is probably my very FAVORITE dial scent ever. As a result I find it very difficult to find in local stores (and expensive to find and buy online) but all in all I realize it is well worth the trouble each and every time I wash my hands</li>
    <li> I used this as a refill for all my original pump bottles.  Including one pump bottle that turns it into a foam that I can put it on the washbasin for my hands.  In order to do so I mix one part to three parts water.  It takes some shaking to get it to mix well, but once it&#x27;s done it saves a lot of money rather than buy&lt;br /&gt;a regular foamy soap and works just as well.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in the stores around here. So easy to order it. I like the idea of it being antibacterial, and needed  a blue colored soap. Perfect.</li>
    <li> The bottle arrived with about 2 inches of dust on it like it was old as dirt.  The soap was like water.  It did not make any kind of suds when you tried to wash your hands.  Definitely NOT worth the purchase.  It was a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> If so it creates suds and cleans</li>
    <li> Best scent ever but not worth buying online. This is available at Walmart for less than $4 defiantly worth the drive to that store</li>
    <li> Good product and works in Simplehuman pump, but is WAY overpriced online. Found the same thing at Walmart for $3.96.</li>
    <li> Finally a antibacterial hand soap for a great price. Kudos to Amazon marketplace!!!</li>
    <li> It smells like Spring Water. But don&#x27;t drink it.</li>
    <li> I went to the store and cost was much less ounce per ounce. Take the time to purchase this item at a store.</li>
    <li> Besides the ridiculously high price, the bottle i received was not sealed and the soap doesn&#x27;t lather.  i wouldn&#x27;t doubt it was watered down.  I recommend making a trip to Walmart and avoiding this purchase online.</li>
    <li> I love the foam, the cleaning and the antibacterial qualities of Dial Foamy hand soap.  But, finding this ultra-pleasant and extra clean smelling version in refill bottles locally is a virtually futile joust.

    <li> DOESN&#x27;T DRY OUT YOUR HANDS LIKE SOME SOAPS DO I WOULD TOTALLY BUY THIS AGAIN LAST A LONG TIME TOO SINCE THE BOTTLE IS SUCH A GOOD SIZE ITS REALLY WORTH THE MONEY SPENT SAVES IN THE LONG RUN BIG TIME</li>
    <li> A very economical way to go.  We love Dial Antibacterial.</li>
    <li> I am a person with a very sensitive immune system and even more sensitive to fragrances. I try to use eco-friendly products as much as possible, but have found the use of essential oils in many aggravates my immune issues and some products have a tendency to loose their freshness. I&#x27;ve been using this product from a local store in the individual bottles for a few months now in our kitchen and master bath. I can tell when another soap is used in the house. This one is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t have a lingering strong perfume scent. The larger refill size was perfect for me as I was my hands frequently.</li>
    <li> Does not lather like soft soap! Watery and just not effective in cleaning hands. Will not purchase again!</li>
