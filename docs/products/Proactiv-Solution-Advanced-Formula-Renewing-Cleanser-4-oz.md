      <li>I love this product, always have...will order more when I have finished...</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and GREAT price:):)</li>
      <li>I have been using Proactiv Solution Renewing Cleanser (part 1 of 3 steps) for many years.  </li>
      <li>I did originally buy as a kit, but I find it more cost effective to buy each piece separately.  </li>
      <li>great product i recommend it to every body is work good and being use it for long time.</li>
      <li>Product has been working great on skin which is oily to normal.</li>
      <li>I use the complete system and have found that it is great for controlling acne.</li>
      <li>It is not 100 percent effective (nothing is) but it is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>and the order came very quickly ...</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t quite understand why that is, but it&#x27;s fine by me</li>
      <li>My order came quickly and is sealed in a bag and also has the seal around the top.  </li>
      <li>Huge pain.</li>
      <li>overall it is a great product.</li>
      <li>The infomercial is true--Proactiv gives you beautiful skin, and it&#x27;s worth the extra money</li>
      <li>It is worth the money!</li>
      <li>I used to like Proactiv a lot more years back,  It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as effectively as it used to.  </li>
      <li>but this alone with my own moisturizer keeps my skin reasonably clear!</li>
      <li>but I think I found the  right one for her!</li>
      <li>I break out very easily and it has really controlled my breakouts, on top of that its all natural</li>
      <li>It works quickly to take care of the problem.</li>
      <li>If I do get any acne, it is mild.  </li>
      <li>Not old, good expiration date.</li>
      <li>This item arrived very quickly and made my son very happy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The price that Amazon has for Proactive is even better than ordering it direct from the company.</li>
      <li>Nothing is better to get clear skin--not even prescription acne meds.  </li>
      <li>It IS pricey and I have to admit that I hesitate each and every time I purchase it, but it depends on whether or not you believe it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try</li>
      <li>He now uses his own white towel.  </li>
      <li>seeing as I&#x27;m not in the US right now</li>
      <li>I might have to try something else that isn&#x27;t as expensive, but it&#x27;s still a good product at a nice price.</li>
      <li>I hope this will make others aware of this problem.</li>
      <li>Product has been working on my face exactly as it should.</li>
      <li>Although my first month of pro-activ my acne went away and my face began to glow</li>
      <li>Works consistently for my acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>They should be able to make a product that doesn&#x27;t affect everything you touch leave white bleach marks.</li>
      <li>This new formula is way better than the old formula.</li>
      <li>Really stops working after the initial ok results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this on-and-off for years with mixed results and I&#x27;ve finally come to the conclusion that it&#x27;s probably a good time to try something else.</li>
      <li>but, I am back as no other products are as effective.</li>
      <li>Sometime you get nervous order certain products over Amazon.</li>
      <li>Although everything was fine, the bottles indicated an expiration date that is in a few weeks, far sooner than we would be able to use the bottles we ordered.</li>
      <li>Very dissapointing, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying from this source.</li>
      <li>These products really work.</li>
      <li>It works, but you just have to really stick to it.</li>
      <li>but o well nothing really can take care of those.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this on-and-off for years with mixed results and I&#x27;ve finally come to the conclusion that it&#x27;s probably a good time to try something else. Really stops working after the initial ok results. Plus it can be extremely abrasive to sensitive skin, causing more potential breakouts.</li>
    <li> Great product and great results. You must use often to see results. The product does contain a little bleach so don&#x27;t use a colored towel to dry your face.</li>
    <li> I really like using proactive. Its 3 step program is very easy and doesnt take a ton of time. (I actually only do step 3 1-2 times a week bc I have oily skin) But if you have mild to moderate acne proactive can certainly help. Use the cleanser everyday and you will see a difference in a couple days if not 2 weeks. It doesnt work miracle but proactive makes great products. Dont be surprised if it stops working after an extending period of time- its not meant to work forever- at least it didnt for me.</li>
    <li> Proactiv is just amazing. I would highly recommend this to anyone. It works quickly to take care of the problem.</li>
    <li> This product helps with acne. I like the price better on amazon. It seems to be better than from their site. It still is kind of expensive. I might have to try something else that isn&#x27;t as expensive, but it&#x27;s still a good product at a nice price.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for almost 10 years.  Nothing is better to get clear skin--not even prescription acne meds.  Any age can benefit from Proactiv.  The infomercial is true--Proactiv gives you beautiful skin, and it&#x27;s worth the extra money</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, wasn&#x27;t that impressed. My daughter uses the whole line and loves it tho.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Proactiv for more than 5 years.  It really only works for people who have moderate to light acne.  If you have a lot of acne I would recommend the Oxy products.  I like Proactiv; it helps to keep my skin clear.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years. Works consistently for my acne prone skin. I also use a prescription cream once a day in addition to Proactiv. I use this cleanser morning and night with steps two and three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is your first time trying Proactiv products, don&#x27;t be surprised if you experience redness and peeling for the first couple of weeks, just put a little moisture on afterwards(not too much), and it will take care of those dry spots.</li>
    <li> My husband uses it and loves the product.  I hate it because it has benzoil peroxide in it and it doesn&#x27;t tell you on the label that it will take out the color of anything he touches, even if it is a small amount like residue left on his hands.  He now uses his own white towel.  Still, it has and still  takes the color off on my sheets, pretty towels in color and a host of other things.  They should be able to make a product that doesn&#x27;t affect everything you touch leave white bleach marks. This also happens when your face touches something after you have washed.  I hope this will make others aware of this problem.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It does the job and even though it&#x27;s expensive, I will but it anyway. But watch your towels, because it will leave bleach marks on them.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about Proactiv, but since they apparently reformulated it with the Micro-Crystals, it has once again cleared my face quickly and gently.  Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive though...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using proactiv off and on for 8+ years. This new formula is way better than the old formula. I use proactiv only once a day with my clarisonic mia and then use naturalcare tea tree facewash set. Totally amazing! The mia is really helpful in getting the proactiv into my pores so my face is smoother longer. I usually break out before my period and I didn&#x27;t have one pimple. Yay!</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for the great service!  Product arrived sooner than expected!  We will be back to order again!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactive for about 3 years and ym face has cleared up dramatically.  When I started using Proactive I was doing the 3 step solution but overtime I found I only needed Step 1.  As long as it keeps working, I will keep buying!</li>
    <li> My first few weeks in the USA was a very horrible experienced. My face broke out really really bad. I have never had such a polka dot face ever. I tried Dr. Miracle but it didn&#x27;t work. I went online and purchased pro-activ and the results were just what i wanted. Although my first month of pro-activ my acne went away and my face began to glow i am absolutely addicted to pro-activ. I used pro-activ three times a day every day!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use proactive every day (not the toner), and I really think it helps control my breakouts. However, I like the older version better-- it seemed less grainy for some reason. Other than that, I still really live this product, and I will continue to use it. The price that Amazon has for Proactive is even better than ordering it direct from the company. Don&#x27;t quite understand why that is, but it&#x27;s fine by me, I&#x27;ll just continue to buy it here.</li>
    <li> This item arrived very quickly and made my son very happy.&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad to be able to purchase the steps one at a time. He doesn&#x27;t go through all of them at the same pace.&lt;br /&gt;Having to write at least twenty words is just dumb.</li>
    <li> I have been using proactiv for years.  I am 42 and recommend it to anyone with any kind of blemish problems.</li>
    <li> I have been using proactiv on and off for about eight years. Whenever I quit using it I break out. It&#x27;s not magic; it does take some time for your face to clear up. And I can&#x27;t speak about all skin types, but this definitely works on mine. I don&#x27;t have a serious acne problem, but I do break out here and there - especially on my forehead. I&#x27;ve tried Olay, Noxema, Neutrogena, and countless other name brands, and nothing even comes close to Proactiv. It IS pricey and I have to admit that I hesitate each and every time I purchase it, but it depends on whether or not you believe it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Proactive Solution Renewing Cleanser is a good product.  I use the complete system and have found that it is great for controlling acne.</li>
    <li> Works better than the off label brands for my son&#x27;s acne.  If you tried the others and they aren&#x27;t working, try the proactiv cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;Howerver the other brands of toners and lotions you find at local stores work just as well.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Would recomend it to anyone with acne problems.  Starts to work right away to clear the skin.</li>
    <li> proactive i use to use until i tried origins from macys. Origins is all natural and works for a lot of skin types. I break out very easily and it has really controlled my breakouts, on top of that its all natural and they use plant material.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works for me. I will never stop using this. I&#x27;m 39 with acne problems, but I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 or 5 months, and my skin is flawless, no bumps, no marks. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This product is the only thing that works for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It never lets me down. I cant trust anything else.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cleanser #1 along with #2 and #3 and green tea moisturizer for my 15yr old daughter. She has been suffering from bad case of acne for 2,3yrs and she tried everything. but I think I found the  right one for her! The key is be patient and keep using this #1 cleanser and #2, #3 and moisturizer everyday. I can see the acne is going away on the chin, side of her face,forehead etc... one thing I do not like the fact is the bottle is small and wish I don&#x27;t have to order so often. I will order bigger bottle next.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the proactiv line to help with my oily acne prone skin but it didn&#x27;t work the way i wanted so i started using neutrogena products ever since and i&#x27;ve never regretted the switch. However i always loved the renewing cleanser. The beads allow for exfoliating the skin without irritating it. I use it with my neutrogena cleanser so i can exfoliate while cleaning off makeup residue. A great buy!</li>
    <li> Idk why the bad reviews. Two day delivery. Exp in 2015 more than enough time to finish, cheaper than Proactiv and no worries about constant recharge. Will order again. TY</li>
    <li> Seems to be the authentic product. Not old, good expiration date. Feels the same as all of the other proactiv cleanser I have used. Happy to find it available at amazon.</li>
    <li> Best value online! Didn&#x27;t order directly through Proactive because it seems like such a hassle, since they automatically charge your card every 3 months. and I have Amazon Prime:)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, but the tip that sticks out of the lid that blocks the cleanser hole from getting plugged (does that make any sense?) snapped off and the bottle got plugged up every time I used this.  I eventually threw the bottle away with the cleanser still in it.  Huge pain. They should make that tip more durable.</li>
    <li> I used proactive for a long time and tried to give it up for something cheaper. I tried evcerything from beauty shop brands to Olay and nothing worked as good. I am 31 with the skin of a 15 year old without this stuff. It is not 100 percent effective (nothing is) but it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I recieved my product in a timely matter. Product has been working great on skin which is oily to normal.</li>
    <li> I have ordered various Proactive products for my 14 year old son. These products really work. My son and I notice quite a different and it  definitely helps his self confidence having a clearer face. I am really glad I purchased them for him and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> This product does as advertised.  My experiences has been that it does work on my teen and myself with adult acne.</li>
    <li> I had tried this product several years ago and it didn&#x27;t work for me and really only made the problem worse. Several years have passed since then and I thought I would give it another go. I used all three steps and ended up with the same results. I thought maybe I just needed to give it more time so I kept with it for two months and my condition only got worse. I&#x27;ve heard it really works for some but this was not for me.</li>
    <li> I have used.this product.for.years and am very satisfied. I havent found anything else that works as well.  I purchased it from another carrier but but they discontinued it and i dont know why.  They never notified me even though i had it on auto delivery.  It just stopped coming.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mean to gross you out but this product clears out pores and long buried clogged oil comes to the surface and exits. Bumps are then gone. I could sing and dance the praises to this product.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that works for me for a reasonable price. I use it everyday and have no problems with it. Highly reccommend to anyone looking to get rid of acne. It works, but you just have to really stick to it.</li>
    <li> Item was delivered as promised and was as described</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years with excellent results.  Nothing else keeps my skin soft and clear the way Proactiv does.  I only use it once per day and not really for acne but just for clear soft skin.  Without it I do have a breakout once in a while.</li>
    <li> Is really expensive and if I don&#x27;t use it for a couple days my skin breaks out allot.  I did recieve my order fairly quickly just not a big fan of the product  If anyone has any tips on how to &amp;#34;break the cycle&amp;#34; and completley stop using proactive w/o my face breaking out let me know!!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I ordered and this came earlier than projected.  I would recommend this product especially if you do not want to get on a monthly plan with proactiv.</li>
    <li> This is truly a miracle product in my book. This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever used that totally prevents my acne, which can be mild to moderate. I am in my mid -30s, and when I run out of Proactiv, pimples will appear within 24 hours. I&#x27;ve now learned to keep my closet stocked. I always order my Proactiv on Amazon, and I always find good deals.</li>
    <li> I love this product, always have...will order more when I have finished...the shipment..and the order came very quickly ... so nice!!!</li>
    <li> My order came quickly and is sealed in a bag and also has the seal around the top.  I will be ordering from this seller again, very happy with what I got.</li>
    <li> Great Product, I definitely recommend to those who have troubled skin. Expiration date on the Proactiv product is months down the road from when the item arrives at your home.</li>
    <li> Warns you to stay out of sun if using this product. Hard to do if you are a Rancher.</li>
    <li> As a person with awful skin, I thank the world for this product.  I have been using it for years and have been very happy with the results.  The only issue I can find with this product is that it must have a bleach agent in it as my sheets and towels always get blotched and I can only assume it is Proactive.</li>
    <li> I really do love this product! I am in my 50&#x27;s  &amp; still having breakouts while trying to prevent wrinkles....&lt;br /&gt;Proactive cleanser really cleans without drying.. I took a sabbatical from it but, I am back as no other products are as effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used proactive for a long time and know the consistency of this cleanser and that it&#x27;s not as thick to the point of not being able to get it out of the bottle. It&#x27;s literally stuck to the walls of the container and seems dried up. I kept the bottle upside down, shook, squeezed it, and still have to stick my finger in the bottle to get any product. I don&#x27;t know if it was laying somewhere in the warehouse for a while, but it&#x27;s not what I was expecting to receive. Very dissapointing, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying from this source.</li>
    <li> This is still my favorite face cleaning product to use nightly.  It does seem to control my break outs.</li>
    <li> I have had great luck with the Proactive cleanser. I don&#x27;t use all of the accompanying products with it as it dries out my skin but this alone with my own moisturizer keeps my skin reasonably clear! It is worth the money!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son, after using it many years ago myself. Works great for him. His face did tend to dry and redden a little by the 3rd day but we used the moisturizer and all&#x27;s well. Great product.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;It does not get the ones that r from hormones but o well nothing really can take care of those.&lt;br /&gt;I also wish they could send the toner to me but seeing as I&#x27;m not in the US right now no go there. -_-&#x27;</li>
    <li> Have always liked this.  Works so well in a humid climate where humidity and moisturizers clash.</li>
    <li> It works but if you stop it&#x27;ll stop!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good product👍</li>
    <li> i get this for my BF. It&#x27;s the only acne cream he will use. It works great for him. Product arrived in great condition just as pictured.</li>
    <li> The shipment took a while to arrive otherwise it would have gotten 5 stars.  The product worked for me as a teen so I ordered it for my son when he started to break out.  His skin is clearing up after two weeks of using this product, Hooray!</li>
    <li> Sometime you get nervous order certain products over Amazon. Don&#x27;t feel that way about this vendor, I recommend it. Product has been working on my face exactly as it should.</li>
    <li> I have been using Proactiv Solution Renewing Cleanser (part 1 of 3 steps) for many years.  I believe it does help controlling acne and keeping my face cleansed.  If I do get any acne, it is mild.  I do notice a difference in my skin.  Prices from Amazon are good.  I prefer buying the Proactiv 3 step kit in pieces, because I use the renewing cleanser faster than the Step 2 and 3 that come when you buy the kit.  I did originally buy as a kit, but I find it more cost effective to buy each piece separately.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> We bought this product to use as part of a science fair project to compare the effectiveness of acne medications ability to kill acne causing bacteria.  Proactiv was the worst of the lot we tested.</li>
    <li> I used to like Proactiv a lot more years back,  It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as effectively as it used to.  Maybe my skin is just changing but I probably won&#x27;t buy this again,  It didn&#x27;t help that the sender sent me product that expired in 60 days.  They did however refund me for the cleanser but not on the Proactiv lotion which expired in less than 1 month.  That is also not working as well.</li>
    <li> You have results after at least a week of using the product. I haven&#x27;t had much of a break out since.I LOVE product and will def purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using proactiv for over 10 years now. It seems to be the only thing that works for me. I rarely ever gets zits anymore, and if I do, they are small and only last a couple days. Definitely worth a try if u never used it before.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and GREAT price:):)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it 0 star--pictured is the 8oz bottle but I only received 4oz  bottle</li>
    <li> Ran out of step one and it was easier to buy this than pay crazy amounts of money for the whole set again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proactive is the only product that works on my skin. I&#x27;m 35 and my face thinks it&#x27;s 16. Only thing is if you stop using it your acne comes back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep mine step one in the shower and wash my face everyday with it. I&#x27;m too lazy to do it twice a day like it says but once does the job for me :)</li>
    <li> i received my product and the expiration date was 2 months from the day i purchased it.  overall it is a great product.</li>
    <li> Although everything was fine, the bottles indicated an expiration date that is in a few weeks, far sooner than we would be able to use the bottles we ordered.</li>
    <li> After a day of using it, all the text on the outside of the bottle washed off. made me wonder if the product was legit or falsely packaged.</li>
    <li> Love it!!  The best facial cleanser ever, and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT!!  I&#x27;m a Proactive fan now.  Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I struggled with acne beginning in middle school. I have used approximately 20+ over the counter and prescription medications/cleansers to help control it. Proactive has been the only thing to work. I began using it 2001 and have never stopped. I use it morning and night. I also use the toner but not as regularly.</li>
    <li> This face wash is very harsh on the skin.  It&#x27;s got  a lot of beads in it.  To me I could use this twice a day but maybe twice a week.  Not gentle at all.</li>
    <li> Great product! Probably one of the best over the counter acne treatment out there. What helped me was being consistent with this product and using it everyday like I am supposed to. I think that&#x27;s the best way to treat and defeat your acne situation. Acne started to come up again once I skipped using Proactiv for a couple of days. I think about a week or 2, you should start seeing good results, at least that was the case with me. Heat, sweat and dirtiness are the enemy. Good luck!</li>
    <li> the bottle is pretty small, but you only need a small amount when you use it.</li>
    <li> great product i recommend it to every body is work good and being use it for long time. love the product.</li>
