      <li>Very happy with this one, will use it as long as they have it produced.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light, I don&#x27;t detect any fragrance and applies smoothly.  </li>

      <li>Good for the whole family.</li>
      <li>although you do need to give it some 10min before applying any water/sweat/moisture otherwise you can just wipe it off easily.</li>
      <li>He found it didn&#x27;t absorb easily.</li>
      <li>Loved the natural aspect of it.</li>
      <li>That being said, I&#x27;ve still freckled along my cheekbones (where I make sure I apply plenty) and my face has become pretty tan, which is something I was trying to avoid.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Worked very well and cruelty free!</li>

      <li>Works very well on a fair, red headed 20 month old in full sun for over an hour.</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was just because I was sweating a lot</li>
      <li>First of all, I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks...</li>

      <li>I have now ordered this twice, because I like it so much.  </li>
      <li>It went on smooth, the smell was decent and I was VERY pleased that it did not leave the grey hue that I typically get with suntan lotion.</li>
      <li>It really works (and we are grateful).</li>
      <li>Very watery</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong sunscreen smell either (or any other smell).  </li>
      <li>Sport sunscreen has the exact same ingredients (minus fragrance) as the Alba Botanica Kids Sunscreen spf 45, and when I asked Alba about it they responded: &amp;#34;The main difference between these two products is that our Alba Botanica® Kids Sunscreen SPF 45 is tear free and has some fragrance.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>(I use the Alba Botanica facial sunscreen every single day for my face and love it).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>, even though I stay far away from my eyes (I use a different sunscreen around my eyes)--IT STINGS</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick but not neither dry nor oily, and rubs in pretty easily compared to other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sunblocks.  </li>
      <li>Goes on a little greasy, but works very well.</li>

<li> It is sooo difficult to find a good minimally chemical laden sunscreen that actually sinks in and doesn&#x27;t leave a purplish or white sheen on the skin.  </li>
<li> no overwhelming smells.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect mineral sunscreen for my overly sensitive skin.</li>
<li> Not much for me though as I wear contacts and it seemed to have seeped into them.</li>
<li> My eyes were burning so badly that I could hardly keep them open for more than 15 seconds and this lasted about two hours--even after I tried washing my eyes out with water.</li>
<li> as expected from previous use</li>
<li> I am dark brown skinned and my fiance is fare skinned.</li>
<li> and that once it was in my eyes, my contact lenses were further irritating them.</li>
<li> I like this product, however I have a very hard time paying the price for it when Babyganics is less expensive and comes in a larger bottle.</li>
<li> And when I say that it stings, I really mean it stings.</li>
<li> I have to do lower than that because this sunscreen is extremely irritating to the eyes.</li>
<li> Expensive</li>
<li> I had to throw my contacts away and walk around blind all day.</li>
<li> Also, it is insanely liquidy and an odd consistency.</li>
<li> SO* BADLY.</li>

    <li> Great product, it doesn&#x27;t leave white residue, really happy</li>
    <li> Love that this is chemical free.  Is very creamy and easy to rub in.  No white smears.</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks...I work outside and I reapply generously every 90 min-2 hours. That being said, I&#x27;ve still freckled along my cheekbones (where I make sure I apply plenty) and my face has become pretty tan, which is something I was trying to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, even though I stay far away from my eyes (I use a different sunscreen around my eyes)--IT STINGS *SO* BADLY. At first I thought it was just because I was sweating a lot and that once it was in my eyes, my contact lenses were further irritating them. Today, however, I put it on my face, away from my eyes,  was not sweating at all, was not wearing contact lenses and it still stung! And when I say that it stings, I really mean it stings. My eyes were burning so badly that I could hardly keep them open for more than 15 seconds and this lasted about two hours--even after I tried washing my eyes out with water.</li>
    <li> I saw reviews on this sunscreen and decided to give it a try.  It works great for my two kids and even myself on my face.  The quality is great, the product does not streak or run, and it stays on the recommended time.  Expensive but still what is needed for protection.  And you can&#x27;t put a price on that.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen I have used,  purchased because of its ingredients; no harsh chemicals.  It is a smooth sunscreen, applies easily and works great.  Good for the whole family.</li>
    <li> I have now ordered this twice, because I like it so much.  It is sooo difficult to find a good minimally chemical laden sunscreen that actually sinks in and doesn&#x27;t leave a purplish or white sheen on the skin.

    <li> I have been using this for my body for years now and love it.  It&#x27;s thick but not neither dry nor oily, and rubs in pretty easily compared to other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sunblocks.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong sunscreen smell either (or any other smell).  I don&#x27;t often use it on my face so I can&#x27;t comment on if it stings your eyes (I use the Alba Botanica facial sunscreen every single day for my face and love it).&lt;br /&gt;This Sport sunscreen has the exact same ingredients (minus fragrance) as the Alba Botanica Kids Sunscreen spf 45, and when I asked Alba about it they responded: &amp;#34;The main difference between these two products is that our Alba Botanica® Kids Sunscreen SPF 45 is tear free and has some fragrance.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> If I were rating based on effectiveness, I&#x27;d rate five stars. I have to do lower than that because this sunscreen is extremely irritating to the eyes. Both my boyfriend and I put it on our faces and our eyes burned for the entire day. No amount of wiping would help. We were finally able to wash our eyes later, which helped a bit. Not much for me though as I wear contacts and it seemed to have seeped into them. I had to throw my contacts away and walk around blind all day. If you don&#x27;t put it anywhere near your eyes, you will be okay. Also, it is insanely liquidy and an odd consistency.</li>
    <li> loved it. perfect for the scorching jamaican sun. i browned even with the 45 spf. not greasy, soaks in, no overwhelming smells.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect mineral sunscreen for my overly sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Goes on a little greasy, but works very well. Also purchased the Kids Sunscreen and it worked well, too.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Works very well on a fair, red headed 20 month old in full sun for over an hour. Best test is a red head !</li>
    <li> good sun screen, moisturizes/cools the skin as well, and keeps well during hiking/sports - although you do need to give it some 10min before applying any water/sweat/moisture otherwise you can just wipe it off easily. Recommended.</li>
    <li> this worked great this summer for our daughter out in the field all day. Loved the natural aspect of it.</li>
    <li> My husband tried it but didn&#x27;t care for it. He found it didn&#x27;t absorb easily. It served its purpose but we weren&#x27;t that impressed.</li>
    <li> Using this while vacationing in Mexico. It really works (and we are grateful).</li>
    <li> Thick but rubbed in nicely, light, pleasant scent. Worked very well and cruelty free!</li>
    <li> I like this product, however I have a very hard time paying the price for it when Babyganics is less expensive and comes in a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> This is really good stuff. I purchased this for a recent trip to the Bahamas. I am dark brown skinned and my fiance is fare skinned. We both used it and it was great. It went on smooth, the smell was decent and I was VERY pleased that it did not leave the grey hue that I typically get with suntan lotion. Interestingly enough my forehead and one sholder burned but my fiance (who almost always burns) did not have any problems this trip. This is now my suntan lotion of choice and I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very watery and you have to keep on putting on your skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very light, I don&#x27;t detect any fragrance and applies smoothly.  It does not run when you sweat.</li>
    <li> as expected from previous use</li>
