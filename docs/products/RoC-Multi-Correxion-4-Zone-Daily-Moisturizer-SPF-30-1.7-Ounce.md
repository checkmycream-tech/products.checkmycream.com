<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m 36 years old and have oily skin. This cream&#x27;s texture is liquid as a lotion but is very greasy so after you apply it, you will shine and shine, and shine the entire day, even after applying  powder or retouching your make up.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have oily to very oily skin.</li>
    <li> I love Roc products! I have been using it for years now and people are always surprised at my real age.</li>
    <li> Im in my 30s, have very dry skin. I have been using CLinque Dramtically Different Moisturizer but now that I&#x27;m getting older its not doing a great job at taking away dryness. I tried this product,, goes on nicely, drinks in the skin. My skin is much less dry and overall looks and feels better.. Only thing is I do have sensitive skin and my skin does feel some slight burn, I think I should use this every other day not every day.. Also if you use a retinol based eye cream in combo with this you may have irritation/burning so be careful..</li>
    <li> I purchased this after the great reviews I read.  Upon first application, however, I started to get a headache.  If you are at all sensitive to fragrance, this is NOT the product for you.  I will not be able to use this product due to the fragrance.  It is fairly strong.  Even my kids asked what that smell was.  I do not think that other people should be able to walk by you and smell what you have on your face.  It does remain somewhat greasy/tacky on your skin.  I am very disappointed that companies have to continually add fragrance to their products, making it unusable to people who are sensitive to the chemicals that create the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that ROC has another facial sunscreen lotion, but I&#x27;m nervous to try that one (and spend more $$) for fear it will have the same fragrance issues as this product.  My search continues for a product that works for 40+ year old skin without overpowering fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy.  Mu foundation glides on evenly over it.  The thing I like best is the great sun protection provided by this moisturizer.  I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Thank You Roc for continuing to provide products that deliver.  I am in my 50&#x27;s and have been using Roc Retinol Night Cream for about 6 years and my face is smooth and has an even tone with a youthful glow.  I have tried other pricey face creams that just caused my face to appear dull and I then knew it was time to return to ROC Retinol products.  It really exfolliates dead skin and I have seen age spots disappear.  The night cream was too heavy to wear during the day under makeup.  This ROC Four Zone daytime lotion with SPF is perfect for daytime use.  It goes on smooth and spreads easily and is light enough to wear under makeup.  I highly recommend this product for daytime use and the ROC Nightime cream for nightime use to keep your skin youthful.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  I have used ROC before but its hard to find. The pricing on amazon was great. I have purchased this moisturizer before and paid a few dollors more. I was however very unhappy  on how long it took. The vendor took 10 days to get it to me and shipped the wrong item. Amazon people took care of it right away and got it sent to me overnight.  Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> I have used Avon products, Clinique, and Mary Kay and none of them have givem me the results of my RoC products. This is the only product that I can put on in the morning and my skin feels smooth all day rather than getting the tight dry feeling at the end of the day that other products give me. I love the fact that I can order my RoC at Amazon and not have to go out shopping paying higher prices for other brands of even the prices that are at the store for my RoC products. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love ROC.  Their products leave my skin feeling very soft.  What I love about this product, in particular, is the moisture it provides and the fact that it protects me from the sun.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin. Aveeno moisturizers break me out.Any soap based cleansers break me out, etc. This product has a very nice feel. I would say it would be good for 30+  yrs old or slightly dry skin. It has a hint of a mineral shimmer (very slight). I love it! I frequently go out without make-up &amp; only this moisturizer. No one believes me when I tell them my age!!</li>
    <li> AFTER READING REVIEWS I WAS HOPING IT WOULD BE AS GOOD AS THEY SAY. AND IT IS WONDERFUL!!! AFTER 3 DAYS I CAN ALREADY SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN. I HAVE LOST 75LBS AND MY NECK WAS SHOWING IT AND IT HAS HELPED WITH THE SAG ON MY NECK ALSO.</li>
    <li> I use the Roc Multi-Correxion NIGHT Treatment, and have no problems.  However, I just purchased this product, the Multi-Correxion 4-Zone Daily Moisturizer SPF 30.  After TWO uses, my face and neck broke out with little raised bumps in the exact area that I applied the lotion.  I have never had a reaction to a face lotion before, SPF-containing or no SPF, and I have used retinol creams before.  The only good thing is that the raised bumps are only visible if you are close to my face.  My skin feels rough because of the bumps, and it is now very sensitive to touch.  I will be sending this lotion back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this cream for $17.87 via Amazon Prime.  When I received the package, there was lotion on the outside of the bottle and the top of the lotion bottle was slightly unscrewed.  Because I have never had problems with Roc lotions before, I wonder if the vendor is selling a bad batch, and that is why it was such a low price?  Just wondering...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone have suggestions on getting the skin on my face back to normal?</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars because its really greasy. HOWEVER,  it does do everything else. brightens up face, corrects tone and texture. im 30 and asian so (thank goodness) no wrinkles, but my skin feels softer smoother. i had originally purchased it as my DAY cream because of the SPF, but my city has over 100 degree weather 60% of the year. i&#x27;m using it night or when i&#x27;m going to stay home, OR the best bet: if you have enough time apply it in the a.m. do about your things and wait to absorb, BLOT with shine papers AND THEN do your makeup.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of the ROC gold for  a long time and I went out on a limb and decided to purchase the ROC Multi Correxion 4 zone Daily moisturizer. As soon as I put it on, I was hooked. It is silky and you barely need any to cover your face. My skin looks dewy and fresh after applying..love it!</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizer makes my skin really soft. All you need is a little, too much and your skin feels sticky. Especially in warm weather.  Overall I would buy this product again it makes my face feel incredible!</li>
    <li> me and my husband both use it for about 8 years now. no complaints whatsoever. great moisturizing and sun-blocking and doesn&#x27;t feel oily</li>
    <li> This is a expensive moisturizer who just didn&#x27;t cut it to me. There are way better ones out there cheaper than this one. A disappointment from Roc.</li>
    <li> I read other reviews stating that after about 5 days, this moisturizer caused a rash/reaction. So, I tested it on my neck for a week straight and had no problems there. But after 2 days of using it on my face, my skin was peeling and flaking off so badly I could hardly stand to look at myself in the mirror! Seems clear that this is a very poor product if so many have reactions to it - a waste of 20 dollars.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this product for years, so know how it works, and it continues to satisfy our requirements.  The product arrived expediently from the vendor, as promised.</li>
    <li> Usually Roc products have a light pleasant scent. This moisturizer is strongly perfumed, gave me an instant headache. Will return ASAP.</li>
    <li> The price was great. 2 day. shipping awesome. love this product. only wish they&#x27;d make it scent free.&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t really get the very last of the lotion from the bottom. wish it was put in a plastic bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Roc products for years and my skin looks great.  I have always taken special care with my skin and the Roc products really ensure that my skin is still looking good.  I don&#x27;t want to spend tons of money and the pricing of Roc products on Amazon are the best that I found.</li>
    <li> My wife is very happy with this moisturizer. She said that it was the best she has ever had and will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> My husband noticed that I look younger and more beautiful. i&#x27;m 35. It does work. it makes the skin more even both in color and lines. it absorbs quickly and i really like its smell. it gives me a solid sun protection too. i have no eye allergy using it unlike any other cream i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> The entire transaction from start to finish was flawless; love the auto ship feature!&lt;br /&gt;And, you can&#x27;t beat the ageless quality of the product; ROC is wonderful for this aging desert skin!</li>
    <li> I bought this item 2 weeks ago since I used ROC products before and loved them. However, this specific one gave me very severe allergic realtion. At first I thought it was just my skin adjusting to a new skin care, but a few days later I got terrible rash/hive on my entire face and neck that became really itchy with burning sensation.  I never had this kind of experience before with any other skin care product. So not sure what ingredients caused this.</li>
    <li> THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PROIDUCT BY ROC.  IT IS A MOISTURIZER AND SUN BLOCK COMBINED.  I DO A LOT OF GARDENING, AND BY APPLYING THIS  PRODUCT IN THE MORNING, MY FACE IS PROTECTED ALL DAY.  I AM 73 AND DO NOT HAVE ANY WRINKLES BECAUSE OF ROC PRODUCTS.</li>
    <li> I usually love RoC products, but I prefer the RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Daily Moisturizer (it comes in a tube) to this one. They are both SPF 30 but this one has a much more &amp;#34;sunscreen-y&amp;#34; consistency in that it is somewhat oily, and the Retinol Correxion mosturizer smells much better, and of course contains Retinol and is very effective in getting rid of wrinkles. This one is OK, but I will not get it again. In Summary: Too oily, doesn&#x27;t smell as nice, does not contain retinol.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of ROC lotions because I think that they are a good value and perform as advertised. This lotion contains 30 SPF sun protection, ROC retinol and antioxidants to help prevent skin aging. I have found that it is light enough for daily use on combination skin. It is a good base under makeup and is non-irritating. I am in my twenties but have fair skin that is prone to freckling. I spend lots of time outside and prefer a day lotion with sunscreen. I find that ROC products like this one help me maintain even skin tone while protecting me from the aging effects of the sun. This lotion does have a mild fragance, which some people don&#x27;t like. I will buy it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Have used it for the past 10 years and it does what it says. It feels light and is easily absorbed. I  continuously get complements on how young l look and people have been off the mark on average by 10 years</li>
    <li> I cannot tell much about the effectiveness of this cream because I had to return it soon after purchase. After a couple of uses I developed an allergic reaction to it; in general I have a medium sensitivity to creams and body lotions that have strong fragrances (for example, I cannot tolerate &amp;#34;Bath &amp; Body Works&amp;#34; lotions). And it looks like ROC falls into the same category. Too bad because I thought it would have good results.</li>
    <li> this is just like the one that I just review. no good at all. couldn&#x27;t see any different in my skin. the only thing that I like was it made my face feel so good.and it smell great</li>
    <li> The perfume they use in this formula is so overpowering, it induced an immediate headache.  I have no idea what RoC was thinking making this with such a strong, heavy scent.  I will admit that I am sensitive to strong smells and perfumes anyway.  If this is not an issue for you, you may love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer itself is actually quite nice.  It is thin, spreads easily (a little goes a long way), is not greasy (has not caused breakouts), makes my face and neck feel soft. I even played a few hours of tennis (shortly after applying this) and I didn&#x27;t sweat it off.  That is important to my active outdoor lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not one to waste money, and will likely endure the heavy scent until the bottle is used up.  Should I find RoC makes a formula that is unscented or even lightly scented, I will jump on it.</li>
    <li> I have used all prior day moisturizers by ROC and loved them. This one is terrible, I had an allergic reaction that dried out my skin, made it flakey, red, painful, and itchy. This was the last ROC product I will ever buy. Also, I do NOT have sensitive skin - so it is not typical for me to have such reactions, it is rare.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of expensive over the counter products and made my stop at ROC. It is not greasy, hydrates my skin 100%, and makes my skin soft, even toned, and yeah...no wrinkles. Have been using it for years and receive compliments everyday about how my skin glows. I wear this under my foundation to do the trick. I also get compliments on how young I look for my age.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever tried.  Love that it has the SPF.  That only adds to the benefits of this product!</li>
    <li> This product is good. I use it in the mornings after my cleansing routine. I am satisfied with its quality.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product after seeing it recommended in a health magazine. I use a ROC night treatment that contains retinol with no issues. At first I liked this product, I found it to be non-greasy and made my skin more luminous. The scent is strong for those who are sensitive to smell, but I don&#x27;t mind it. Now for the bad...After 5 days of use I suddenly broke out in a red rash all over my neck where I had used this product. I do not have sensitive skin and have never broken out like that from using any product. The rash was yesterday and while the redness has subsided, there are still these tiny little bumps all over my neck where the skin is normally smooth! Not cool. Will discontinue use and try to find a more gentle anti-aging product.</li>
    <li> It works great for me. 58 years and sure I still have crows feet (ex-smoker) but my neck and rest of my face looks great considering all I&#x27;ve put it thru! Only use in the AM cause I&#x27;m a little sensitive to retinol.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and the RoC Multi Corrextion 4-zone worked miracles with me.&lt;br /&gt;The new version RoC Multi Corrextion 5-in-1 Daily Moisturizer breaks my face out.&lt;br /&gt;Please bring back The 4-zone Daily Moisturizer!</li>
    <li> Love the ROC collection.  It really does work</li>
    <li> RoC beauty products are for sure on my favorite&#x27;s list but they are a little pricey. This moisturizer does a big job considering the tiny bottle you get. Two pumps is enough to do the job and I even apply to my neck area to double its benefits! Loving that it has an SPF too because NO ONE likes wrinkles!</li>
    <li> Be warned, this lotion is beige in color and it stained my shirts. I was wondering what the staining was on the front of my shirts along the neckline, then realized it was this product that was responsible. Will also complain to the company plus I didn&#x27;t see any skin improvement after using almost the entire bottle.</li>
    <li> I love roc. My skin looks really good. The reason I gave 3 stars is because the one I received was about to expire in 2 months.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product from Roc, the SPF is very good, the moisture worked well for my very dry, senior skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use Roc products regulary, and this is one that I will for sure continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using roc for many years and truly believe it has kept my 68 year old skin looking smooth.</li>
    <li> At first, I was worried that I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to use this, as after the first few days of using it, I began to develop bumps all overmy forehead &amp; nose &amp; the areas around my eyes stung. Since I really wanted to give it a shot, I began mixing it with an SPF 30 for the face and that seemed to take the edge off &amp; the bumps disappeared. I used it like that for about 2 weeks &amp; then got up the nerve to try it full-strength again. This time, I&#x27;m happy to say that not only did the bumps not reappear, but my skin has not felt this smooth in years! I&#x27;ve seen a little smoothing of wrinkles, but not much reduction of dark spots, but the smoothing benefits are so great, I&#x27;ll continue to use it for a long time, I&#x27;m sure!</li>
    <li> I started using roc multi-correxion a few months ago and I can see a big difference in my complexion. I can even go out without using foundation because my complexion is getting back to the even tone that I usually had.  I am hoping to find a product that will truly help the bags under my eyes.</li>
    <li> not noticing any changes on my skin been using it for a month. wouldn&#x27;t recommend. seller was good and on time.</li>
    <li> help keep my skin moisturized</li>
    <li> I am in my mid-sixties, and I have ‘mature skin’.  I use so many different facial skin products; vitamin c cleansers, serums, hyaluronic acid, facial oils, glycolic cream, Retin-A, just so many lotions and potions and they all promise you great positive results.  I cannot vouch for the results of each product, I just know that they work in conjunction with each other.  I am also aware that whatever damage has been done to my skin in my many years is not about to be corrected in a short amount of time of weeks or a couple of months.  At this point, I am just fighting the uphill battle of both maintenance and hoping for small improvements in my anti-aging battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can vouch for is that RoC Multi-Correxion 4-Zone Daily Moisturizer does a good job of moisturizing my dry mature skin. This creamy, and lightweight moisturizer immediately absorbs into my face.  My dry skin becomes very soft and supple.  It actually makes a perfect base and my make-up just glides on effortlessly, and neither my liquid foundation nor my mineral foundation accentuates those fine lines when I use this moisturizer.  There is a slight pleasant fragrance, but it is barely distinguishable.  I do wear facial oil under any moisturizer that I use because I live in the hot desert and I need all the protection, but Roc Daily Moisturizer does work better than other moisturizers since it does keep my face hydrated the entire day. The SPF 30 is another important feature concerning this moisturizer.  There is nothing better than a CO2 treatment which is both painful and expensive, to bring about the awareness of sun damage.  I do not wear a sunscreen if I am not planning to go out, but there have been some unexpected situations, requiring me to leave the house when I have already applied my make-up without my sunscreen.  Knowing that Roc Daily Moisturizer has the SPF 30 is reassurance that I do have sun protection in this type of emergency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading my review.</li>
    <li> I normally love Roc products, but this one is a bit greasy.  My face stays shiny after I use it.  I prefer the Neutrogena Visibly even 30 spf one in the white and gold tube.  It absorbs much better and is good under make-up if you wear it sometimes.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and happy to get a replacement for a terrific discontinued product.  It makes the skin luminous, smooth and works to lighten those dark spots.</li>
    <li> made my face peel and break out. after using it for a couple weeks, it took me a couple months to get my skin back to normal. i was reccomended this product by my dermatologist... but forget it. i&#x27;m going back to Clinique.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything from very expensive creams to store brands. This cream is just ok. It is light and does not leave my face feeling greasy at all. It was worth a shot.</li>
    <li> I wore this product and got a sunburned nose. It was the strongest spf I had ever purchased before. I looked at the bottle and there was a 2009 date on it. I then looked at the nightcream I bought also and it&#x27;s date was 2008. I would definately not purchase another item from here like this, you never know what you will get or how old it is.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried most products.. from L&#x27;Oreal to La Mer.. This is hands down my favorite. Moisturizes without making me break out or feel greasy.. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> As with any of these, your opinion is objective. Nothing outstanding here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several products over the year ranging from high end expensive brands to prodcuts off the drug store shelf.  This is by far one of the best Moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.  For the money I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find a better option.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried - and I&#x27;ve tried many, including pricey ones. This leaves my skin super soft, even and luminous (in a very natural way) and it won&#x27;t cause breakouts. It has a very subtle, pleasant smell. It also offers great sun protection and it is keeping wrinkles at bay. I use it everyday, buy one every month and will be buying this product for a long time. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Good product, generous savings from retail.... Roc Multi-Correction Moisturizer.....Would strongly reccomend to all women.  The most popular product out there at a fair price.....</li>
    <li> This daily moisturizer is great.  I&#x27;ve been using ROC for about a year now &amp; really like their product line.  I find I get good results with only using a small amount of the moisturizer on a daily basis.  I also use their skin serum.  My skin has never looked so good!  I would definitely recommend for anybody trying to get good skin protection from the sun while maintaining a fresh look.</li>
    <li> Buyer Beware!  This formula left my skin feeling greasy and after about a week of using this product I broke out in a terrible rash that lasted well over a week.  I required three steroid shots and a cortisone cream to get the swelling and rash to go down.  This is the first skincare product I have ever used that caused an allergic reaction. I would recommend reading the ingredients list thoroughly before purchasing.</li>
    <li> Order three of this item and they came without the original box.  They were opened and used before.  I need to pay postage for shipping or returning the item which is not worth it.</li>
    <li> If you are getting older and your face is starting to dry out alittle, this is a product that I would say is a must get.&lt;br /&gt;I ware it after my shower at night and when I wake my face is much smoother.</li>
    <li> I am not opposed to a scent in my products...but this is incredibly strong.  I put a bit on the back of my hand to test, and thankfully.  I began to tear and redness on the back of my hand from the scent.  I have used ROC for years, different skin products and love this company but not this one.  They discontinued my sunblock and am very disappointed with trying the Daily Moisturizer SPF 30.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind smelling like an old man, then you won&#x27;t mind this product.</li>
    <li> I used this as directed but really didn&#x27;t see any improvement of my fine lines or wrinkles over time. It did feel okay as a moisturizer but that was not my main purpose for paying it.</li>
    <li> I am seeing some results from this product.  I plan on continued use over the next couple of months. It does seem to tighten pores and minimizes small wrinkles within the first month of usage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say, but I had pretty bad allergic reaction to this creme, with severe rashes under my eyes, I use other RoC products with no problem.</li>
    <li> If you have combination skin or dry skin, I would consider another product.  It disappears quickly and my skin does not feel any different.  Absolutely not worth the money.</li>
    <li> if this product is doing anything.  my skin looks more even, but i still have the dark spots and wrinkles i had before.  but i am not even half way through the bottle.  i don&#x27;t like the texture of the moisturizer, so i use it at night.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love this lotion for my face!  It is thick enough to give me good coverage with just a little and thin enough to not clog my skin.</li>
    <li> I love the ROC series. I&#x27;m almost 40 and most people are surprised by my age. I don&#x27;t look like most 30 year olds.</li>
    <li> i break out even with products that are for sensitive skin and ones that are for all skin types.  i have been using this product for a number of years.  it delivers on what it targets.  no miracles just improvement.  my skin is very happy with it!</li>
    <li> The formula is a little different, compared to the multi-correxion. But, works very well, particularly for the summer. Prompt service too.</li>
    <li> This is light, does not burn my eyes, and does not cause me to break out. I like this product as a daily moisturizer and sunblock, but don&#x27;t really notice any significant change in my skin overall.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m now using all their products.  I am 58 and have used Olay, Lancome, Keihls, etc.  This is the first product that provided SIGNIFICANT results.</li>
    <li> IT MADE ME BREAKOUT, CLOGGED SKIN AND I LOOKED TIRED AND UGLY,  THINK ITS THE RETIN A STAY AWAY IF U WANNA LOOK GOOD</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  We both use this and we have not break outs.  It has a slight fragrance that we both love.  I need a case of this stuff for summer.</li>
    <li> Product seemed to work well but too strong for my sensitive skin.  Gave to a friend who actually loved it and started using the ROC line.</li>
    <li> Watch expiration dates! The product I ordered had an expiration date only 6 months from the date I received it. So if you are going to &amp;#34;stock up&amp;#34; and buy this in advance, I would be careful. I ended up using this product by the expiration date, so it worked out; product was creamy and smelled as expected, but about halfway through the bottle, the pump stopped working, so I had to unscrew the lid and remove product with my pinkie.</li>
    <li> I use this at night &amp; love it.  Roc makes great stuff.  My skin feels noticeably softer, &amp; there is never a greasy feel after I apply it.</li>
    <li> I have been using for a month now. I like the way it feels fresh and light. I don&#x27;t notice any change in the appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle and if used daily (or nightly) this stuff really works! I have had a lifelong problem with dark circles under my eyes and this stuff really puts it in check. I applied a few drops every night under my eyes religiously for about 2 weeks and it lightened the area. I will say it does nothing for the saggy bags under my eyes, but it does wonders to lighten up the darkness leaving a more youthful, fresh look. Now if I could just find something to erase the bags, I could look 30 again! Also, This is my 3rd tube I&#x27;ve boughten in a 2 year span...you only need a drop or two under each eye so this tube should last you at least 4 months or more and for the price, it&#x27;s a great deal :-)</li>
    <li> I was sent the wrong product....instead of the Daily Moisturizer with SF 30 I was sent ROC Multi Correction - Skin Renewing Serum. Will be returning as I need a moisturizer with sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I tried completing return process and Amazon won&#x27;t let me return this so now I am stuck with a product I didn&#x27;t order :(</li>
    <li> I bought this and when I applied it on, it was greasy feeling and it didn&#x27;t absorb into my skin. My skin felt and looked greasy all day. I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have been using Roc Products for about four years now.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way my face feels &amp; looks.&lt;br /&gt;Wrinkles around eyes have decreased since I have been using it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 47 and have had problems with aging spots &amp; some dullness. Using Roc Products there has been&lt;br /&gt;Such an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this product never discontinues..</li>
    <li> Same as the other product, have not had time enough to see results yet, check back with me in a moth or so.</li>
    <li> This is a good product to be used as a daily moisturizer.  Excellent that it contains SPF 30 while moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I received my order today and I&#x27;m really disappointed to see that it is expired. Make sure to check your box for the expiration date before you open it. Not sure if I can return the product since I ripped into the box to get the product out before seeing the date. Since I need a good facial sunscreen, I&#x27;m not willing to risk a chance of getting a sunburn by using it if its no longer effective. $23.00 lost.😞</li>
    <li> use this daily,  I like the way my skin feels. Ok makeup base  spend  outside in wind and cold, good protection</li>
    <li> I was excited about this product, but if you have sensitive skin or even just slightly sensitive skin do not use it.  It gave me a rash all over my face so I asked a friend if they could use it and told her how my skin reacted to it.  She did not have sensitive skin but she and her significant other also broke out in rashes.  Disappointed...</li>
    <li> I had been using Mary Kay prior to buying this RoC product. I have to say, this is worlds better and I am so pleased with the difference I see. I am still young but have had wrinkles showing. This keeps my skin moisturized and adds a nice glow.</li>
    <li> Nice I am hitting 49 this year.  I have been using this for about a year now.  I really wish I would have started using this product sooner though.  My skin feels healthier than it did before using Roc products, not as crepe like as before.  I like it because it has SPF 30 in it.</li>
    <li> Great price.  Have always liked this product.</li>
    <li> this is a great product. it&#x27;s not greasy,feels silky smooth. i would recomend to anybody who ask. will purchase aging</li>
    <li> I do NOT typically have sensitive skin, but in 3 uses, this destroyed my skin. It has been over a month and my skin is still not back to normal. I&#x27;m convinced it even triggered eczema, a condition I&#x27;ve never had before. Just don&#x27;t use this, it&#x27;s not worth the risk.</li>
    <li> I usually do not write reviews. This product is horrible for me. I am 4 mo pregnant and started using this product 2 wks ago. All of a sudden, I woke up w/ rashes all over my face and neck. My face was also very swollen that I ended up in the Emergency room. Dr. gave me steroid and benedryl. Took 3 days for my face to be back to normal. I am usually not allergic to anything. Most ppl will do fine as you can see on the reviews, however, it didn&#x27;t work out for me. So becareful.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this particular product though I have used RoC Deep Wrinkle Night Cream for years and also love it.  I have been searching high and low for a good anti-aging day cream with at least 30 SPF that will not make my skin greasy...and I found it in RoC!  I read many of the reviews before buying this product and I can say I am very happy I purchased this.  Not only is it a great product but you can&#x27;t beat the price at Amazon...it was at least $5 more expensive at all the retail locations around me!  I also want to add that I purchased the RoC Multi-Correxion Night Treatment to use in conjunction with this product...this is also a great item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me:&lt;br /&gt;- in my early 30s&lt;br /&gt;- fair skin with light freckles&lt;br /&gt;- mostly T zone oiliness but some products make me oily all over&lt;br /&gt;- very infrequent blemishes&lt;br /&gt;- some fine lines around my eyes&lt;br /&gt;- I use mineral makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wanted from a product:&lt;br /&gt;- SPF 30&lt;br /&gt;- good moisturization&lt;br /&gt;- not greasy or heavy&lt;br /&gt;- quick absorption&lt;br /&gt;- diminish fine lines and wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;- even my skin tone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use the product:&lt;br /&gt;- I swipe some witch hazel on my face and neck after my shower&lt;br /&gt;- I then put a little water on my face...so when I put on the moisturizer it goes on smoothly and seals in the water on my skin&lt;br /&gt;- I put 2 pumps on my fingers and spread it around and then pat it all over my face and neck...yes even on my eyelids and around my eyes...with no burning sensation (just avoid getting it IN your eyes)&lt;br /&gt;- I then rub it in&lt;br /&gt;- I go make myself a cup of coffee and when I get back it has absorbed well enough to apply my makeup.  I wear powder mineral makeup and have no problem with it going on smoothly over the moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this product:&lt;br /&gt;- SPF 30&lt;br /&gt;- my skin feels moisturized without any excess oiliness...with other products typically by 10am I am using blotting papers on my T zone for the oiland shine&lt;br /&gt;- absorbs quickly...within 5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;- I noticed an immediate change in my skin tone...within a day a few small blemish marks were lighter&lt;br /&gt;- my face feels hydrated and supple without feeling like I have much on my face&lt;br /&gt;- my makeup stays put all day...not something I was expecting but it&#x27;s an added bonus!!&lt;br /&gt;- my skin seems to look and feel better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t love but can definitely live with:&lt;br /&gt;- the fragrance is a bit much for my liking but it doesn&#x27;t bother me and I think it just takes a few days to get used to it and eventually you won&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s there.  A previous reviewer stated that the scent was so strong it gave her a headache and everyone around her could smell it.  Not that I disagree with her but each person has their own opinion.  I myself am very sensitive to some fragrances as I get migraines easily.  Of course the scent seemed strong at first because I&#x27;ve never used this product before so my olfactory senses were in overdrive but the scent seemed less strong the second day and so on.  This may be a deal breaker for some people but not for me...the pros most definitely outweigh the cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love a RoC products</li>
    <li> I was very surprised a the effectiveness of this product. I was just looking for a good and inexpensive moisturizer with 30 SPF. I have a very young face for my age and I am blessed with little to no wrinkles. I started to notice some light frown lines on my forehead and between my eyebrows. As someone who is not used to seeing wrinkles, no matter how light they are it came as a shock. After about 7-10 days of using the product, the lines were visibly lighter and basically invisible on my forehead. I never thought stuff like this worked. It may not work for others but it worked for me. $11 beats $65 for the high end moisturizers I used to buy. I am now a fan of many RoC products.</li>
    <li> Did what is was suppose to do - wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I began using this product about a month ago in conjunction with the night and eye creams. This product does just what it says. I&#x27;ve noticed reductions in the fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead. My skin has become more even in texture. The SPF has helped to prevent burns. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product so I can&#x27;t tell if there are any benefits. I do want to tell you how strong the fragrance is. At first it was overwhelming, and a bit concerning, because products with perfumes and dies are not good for your face. But, I bought it, so I&#x27;m going to use the bottle and see if I notice any change.  You do get used to the smell after a few uses, and it wears off throughout the day. Lets be clear-its not a nasty smell, its clearly fragrance they added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its also a bit oily, the instructions says use generously, but unless you want your face to feel like you ate a bucket of fried chicken, 1 pump (2 MAX) should be enough. Rub in well and its not that bad. Kind of gives a nice dewy glow.</li>
    <li> i will keep on with this product  while using ROC wrinkle cream, as you must have sun protection, it&#x27;s light and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;A1 IS MY OPINION. WILL USE AGAIN AND AGAIN</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer, it gives me an instant glow when I apply. I love that the SPF is higher as well.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now, and it&#x27;s like wearing make-up that gives your skin that instant pick-me-up. And it is very reasonably priced! I saw it reviewed on DR OZ and am so glad I purchased. I bought a bottle for my sister and my mom, and they are hooked on it as well :)</li>
    <li> I put it together as soon as I recieved it and put right to work and i was really surprised at what it picked up from my carpet that i thought was already somewhat clean and my old cleaner quit on me. I saw the navigator elite advertised and had decided that i would  like to buy one and I am I decided to buy through aMAIZON .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 60. Started out with this line of the RoC products. Was very pleased with the results, but moved on to the amazine Lift/Anti-Gravity line. I introduced my daughter to the 4-Zone day and nighttime moisturizers (she is 30), and she has been thrilled with the results on her acne-prone skin. She also uses the cleansing pads. RoC rocks!</li>
