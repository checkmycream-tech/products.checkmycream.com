<ol>
      <li>So I ordered it and hoped for the best.</li>
      <li>Excellent for the neck</li>
      <li>Still the best of the serums for my money.</li>
      <li>This is the best product I have every used.</li>
      <li>Very good product</li>
      <li>did before and after pictures of my own and sent in to them but have yet to see my untouched photos!</li>
      <li>It might have lots of good stuff in it, but it did not result in any improvement to my face whatsoever.</li>
      <li>I loved this product.</li>
      <li>It seems to be good, though it is quite pricey.</li>
      <li>and I am VERY pleased</li>
      <li>It would be better if it were in a pump type of packaging</li>
      <li>Really love Perricone products</li>
      <li>fantastic product!</li>
      <li>I have even used cheaper ones from the pharmacy that I think were better.</li>
      <li>The MSDS refers to 100% concentrations, so is it safe at lower doses?</li>
      <li>Love the Perricone products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably better than using nothing, but nothing special at all.</li>
      <li>the smile lines more prenounced.  </li>
      <li>love this stuff, perricone could do no wrong for me</li>
      <li>Sighs I really wanted to be able to use this but</li>
      <li>product&#x27;s Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) says that it phenoxyethanol is harmful if swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through the skin and that it can cause reproductive damage.</li>
      <li>If you can afford it than I think it is worth spending your money on it since it did have changes on my skin.</li>
      <li>THE PRODUCT CONTAINS A CHEMICAL CALLED PHENOXYETHANOLTHAT CAN BE ABSORBED THROUGH YOUR SKIN.  </li>
      <li>so you can just pump out the right amount of the product.</li>
      <li>I really was excited that I finally purchased this product because I read so many reviews of how this product changes your skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 53 yrs young and do have pretty good skin, but was noticing the eleven line starting to show on my forhead and</li>
      <li>feels good but a little pricey</li>
      <li>Makes skin look better than ever; would probably work wonders on a younger person,especially if used faithfully  and long-term.</li>
      <li>Always the first thing I put on after cleansing.</li>
      <li>It does EXACTLY what it says it will do</li>
      <li>love, love, love Dr. Perricone&#x27;s Cold Plasma Face cream.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s fresh or old stock</li>
      <li>I gagged 3 times while applying it to my face, I then applied my la prairie serum which is highly fragranced, to try and cover the smell.</li>
      <li>54 years old, veteran in face products.  </li>
      <li>I gave it three stars because three stars means &amp;#34;It&#x27;s OK&amp;#34;, and it is; it&#x27;s not horrible or anything, just not great by any means.</li>
      <li>As many reviews do say and it is true, it does have a slight fish smell to it, but it does go away after a few minutes once on the skin; at least it does on mine.  </li>
      <li>Cold Plasma is great for keeping dark spots at bay.</li>
      <li>and I feel as much as you try to use as little as possible</li>

<li> The only bad part is the smell</li>
<li> It is a very expensive product, therefore I will continue to try other types of skin care that will meet a price point I can afford.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately I must say that it smells like rotting carcass, like 10 rotting carcasses.</li>
<li> just wish it was a bit cheaper...way to expensive..</li>
<li> Since I started to use Cold Plasma Face they have diminished quite a bit and look morer firmer.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve bought the 0.5 ounce to give Cold Plasma a try</li>
<li> but it smells so bad</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really was excited that I finally purchased this product because I read so many reviews of how this product changes your skin and it&#x27;s holy grail material. Also I read the reviews that said the product smells like rotten fish and others said there was no smell. So I ordered it and hoped for the best. Unfortunately I must say that it smells like rotting carcass, like 10 rotting carcasses. I gagged 3 times while applying it to my face, I then applied my la prairie serum which is highly fragranced, to try and cover the smell. It didn&#x27;t work, so I waited, hoping the smell would dissipate, but no such luck. After 30 minutes I could torture myself no more, I was still gagging. I just had to wash my face. Sighs I really wanted to be able to use this but the smell of the product is unbearable. I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s fresh or old stock but it smells so bad I will not open that jar again. I&#x27;m jealous of those lucky folks that say their product doesn&#x27;t smell or doesn&#x27;t smell as bad. And fyi I&#x27;m a regular person with no hypersensitive sense of smell.</li>
    <li> I do not like the smell. Not different like $10 face cream</li>
    <li> love, love, love Dr. Perricone&#x27;s Cold Plasma Face cream. It does EXACTLY what it says it will do and I am VERY pleased</li>
    <li> Really love Perricone products</li>
    <li> THE PRODUCT CONTAINS A CHEMICAL CALLED PHENOXYETHANOLTHAT CAN BE ABSORBED THROUGH YOUR SKIN.  HERE IS WHAT THE MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEET SAYS ABOUT THE CHEMICAL.  . Glycols are a series of chemicals that find their way into all sorts of things: paint, lacquer, jet fuel.....&amp;#34; Phenoxyethanol is used as an anti-bacterial in cosmetics as well as a stabilizer in perfume.&lt;br /&gt;The product&#x27;s Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) says that it phenoxyethanol is harmful if swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through the skin and that it can cause reproductive damage. The MSDS refers to 100% concentrations, so is it safe at lower doses? In cosmetics the concentrations are typically 0.5% to 1%.&amp;#34;  SADLY, WHEN I E MAILED THE PERRICONE COMPANY AND SUGGESTED THEY REMOVE IT FROM THEIR PRODUCTS, THEY ESSENTIALLY IGNORED MY REQUEST.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have every used. It is like a face lift in a jar. The only bad part is the smell but it seems to soften as time goes on.</li>
    <li> Excellent for the neck</li>
    <li> Always the first thing I put on after cleansing. I can tell when I run out and try to do without. Can&#x27;t explain it but it makes a difference in my skin. I&#x27;m too critical of my appearance, but when others say &amp;#34;gee your skin looks great&amp;#34; well there it is.</li>
    <li> I loved this product. but, I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> feels good but a little pricey</li>
    <li> Despite all the hype about Perricone products, I can say definitely that this product was no better than any other average face cream that I have used. I have even used cheaper ones from the pharmacy that I think were better. It might have lots of good stuff in it, but it did not result in any improvement to my face whatsoever. I gave it three stars because three stars means &amp;#34;It&#x27;s OK&amp;#34;, and it is; it&#x27;s not horrible or anything, just not great by any means. It&#x27;s probably better than using nothing, but nothing special at all.</li>
    <li> It seems to be good, though it is quite pricey. The smell is not great, but it is smooth and not sticky..</li>
    <li> fantastic product! Love the Perricone products. I am hooked.</li>
    <li> Still the best of the serums for my money. Makes skin look better than ever; would probably work wonders on a younger person,especially if used faithfully  and long-term.</li>
    <li> love this stuff, perricone could do no wrong for me</li>
    <li> 54 years old, veteran in face products.  does not do as on ads on tv or in the mags.  did before and after pictures of my own and sent in to them but have yet to see my untouched photos!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought the 0.5 ounce to give Cold Plasma a try and I do like the results it has done for my face.  I&#x27;m 53 yrs young and do have pretty good skin, but was noticing the eleven line starting to show on my forhead and the smile lines more prenounced.  Since I started to use Cold Plasma Face they have diminished quite a bit and look morer firmer.  As many reviews do say and it is true, it does have a slight fish smell to it, but it does go away after a few minutes once on the skin; at least it does on mine.  What I don&#x27;t like is the consistancy of the cream.  It is to watery and I feel as much as you try to use as little as possible I always tend to put to much on the face and for the price I feel it is to expensive to overuse.  It would be better if it were in a pump type of packaging so you can just pump out the right amount of the product. It is a very expensive product, therefore I will continue to try other types of skin care that will meet a price point I can afford.  If you can afford it than I think it is worth spending your money on it since it did have changes on my skin.</li>
    <li> Very good product, My wife loves it...just wish it was a bit cheaper...way to expensive..</li>
    <li> package was fine, the jar came open, awful smell..</li>
    <li> Cold Plasma is great for keeping dark spots at bay.</li>
