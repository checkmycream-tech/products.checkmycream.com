<li> What a waste of money!</li>
<li> It takes forever to ship and when i received it it was so hard, i cant even use it.</li>
<li> honestly it&#x27;s not like I lost a lot of money</li>
<li> yet kinda disappointed about that...</li>
<li> the smell is just very unpleasant</li>
<li> Horrible.</li>
<li> so CHINERISH - you know that horrible smell of Made in China</li>

    <li> its okay but  It smells so CHINERISH - you know that horrible smell of Made in China products.&lt;br /&gt;Does everything have to be made over there though</li>
    <li> Horrible. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> I use these face puff sponges for my countouring kit, and I love them. I like the different colors so I can remember what I use for each shade. They are good quality and an excellent deal. I feel they are well made and I have yet to find a better price than this.</li>
    <li> So much easier to use under your eyes instead of brushes and so much softer! These are wonderful! They came earlier than anticipated and I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> one of the best blending sponges i&#x27;ve come across. i gave some to my daughter and she loves them as well.  blends perfectly</li>
    <li> I hope im going to like them but they haven&#x27;t even gotten to my house yet kinda disappointed about that... But I cant wait until they get here</li>

    <li> My order came with 4 and it was suppost to be 6</li>
    <li> Pretty colors! Love the different colors and the feel. They don&#x27;t feel soft enough to apply foundation because it just seems to soak up my foundation after I wet the sponges. However, they are pretty and I use them all for decor now :)</li>
    <li> Great for small makeup touch ups</li>
    <li> I did not get what I ordered. They were different shapes and I only got five, I was looking forward to all the cute colors, but I just got 2 pink and 3 light blue. They still work ok tho.</li>
