      <li>and I love it!  </li>

      <li>my favorite cosmetic.</li>
      <li>I would recommend using the regular Q10 cream, which is SO awesome, and putting this on over it if you are going in the sun.</li>
      <li>This is the best facial moisturizer with sunscreen that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>So i was glad to know that it is on line.</li>
      <li>I will not claim that this product has changed my life, but I do feel better knowing I am compliant with dermatologist-recommended face lotion.</li>
      <li>I have been using Eucerin Q10 for years and love it.  </li>
      <li>Now my gripe with the product is that because it contains SPF 15, this will lull many consumers into thinking they are covered for sun protection.  </li>
      <li>I wish more stores carried the Q10.</li>
      <li>but it seems my skin has been breaking out more since using it.</li>
      <li>I have used this for years and still consider it my favorite.</li>
      <li>There are so many choices</li>
      <li>have used Eucerin sunscreen as my morning moisturizer for years, glad I started and got in the habit.  </li>
      <li>I have only been using it about 2 weeks and its perfect.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years but could no longer get it at the retail stores.  </li>
      <li>This works better that stated.</li>
      <li>This was a great, reasonably priced lotion that I use every day.</li>
      <li>product I take some care applying to make sure I don&#x27;t have streaks, it does have a bit of whiteness to it.</li>
      <li>It has a very nice top on it if that matters to you, the pointed type; so you don&#x27;t pour out too much at once.</li>
      <li>I use this product every day, it gives me good protection for my face, it is not expensive as some of the products out there.</li>
      <li>Perfect for every single day.  </li>
      <li>and I like this lotion better than the night cream since the consistency is light and absorbs well</li>
      <li>Love the light texture.</li>
      <li>Good stuff, works very well on face and neck.</li>
      <li>Just be sure to use a full spectrum sunscreen along with the moisturizer.</li>
      <li>The product itself is fine</li>
      <li>Works fine under my makeup.  </li>
      <li>This is a good, light moisturizer for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Both are fantastic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free</li>
      <li>Makes skin smooth.</li>
      <li>The lotion is light and does not smell at all.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly</li>
      <li>I take Q10 on a regular basis and I am happy to have found it in a lotion too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also great to use prior to putting on makeup</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and people tell me I look fabulous for my age.  </li>
      <li>Not sure if the wrinkle part works yet, but the lotion part is awesome.  </li>
      <li>It goes on really light and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>Right?!</li>
      <li>Many moisturizer with SPF do not contain broad spectrum protection, so make sure to check the labels.    </li>
      <li>Would be great if they offered it with a slightly higher spf to last just a bit longer (since I don&#x27;t reapply over my makeup).</li>
      <li>Great price on a great low scent, non-greasy lotion that protects well against the sun without the heavy feel of a sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>Then I saw it in my dermatologist&#x27;s office and thought here&#x27;s a second good recommendation.  </li>
      <li>I also purchased the 2-pack of Eucerin Q10 Cream which is really good for the back of the hands</li>
      <li>but it fades fast :)</li>
      <li>i really think it help smooth fine lines.  </li>
      <li>It is non-greasy and absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>This product is exceptional - it not only adds moisture to the skin, but also includes SPF protection.  </li>
      <li>I have fair, sensitive skin, and have used other skin and sunscreen products before, with varied results, but this one is definitely my favorite!</li>
      <li>Along with their other skin care product, Nivea Original, I feel good about the appearance of my skin along with the complements.</li>
      <li>I have finally found something that is affordable that I love!  </li>
      <li>This is a great point in my opinion since you don&#x27;t waste it like some creams.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great for everyday use.</li>
      <li>This sensitive skin lotion is fabulous!</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and thought that I would be able to use this product</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light-weight, not greasy, absorbs quickly into the skin and leaves your skin baby-soft with no tackiness.</li>
      <li>This is a fabulous light weight lotion which can be applied all day if necessary.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very gentle with no scent.  </li>
      <li>It feels good at first, but I stopped usage because that my skin was a little allergic to that.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more when I need it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> my favorite cosmetic. Use it everyday.</li>
    <li> So you could start now and reduce the wrinkles you might have coming to you.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Eucerin sunscreen as my morning moisturizer for years, glad I started and got in the habit.  I am not a makeup person, just a morning moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;After a while I realized the back of my neck needed it as much as my face, now I&#x27;ve started using sunscreen on my wrists and back of my hands too after noticing sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I&#x27;d started with all of it earlier back when this kind of thing hadn&#x27;t occured to my pre-wrinkle self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product I take some care applying to make sure I don&#x27;t have streaks, it does have a bit of whiteness to it. It feels good and my skin has reacted to sunscreen products in the past but not to this.</li>
    <li> It sometimes tough to find a good face lotion that protects you from the sun. I use this as a daytime lotion and it gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, but it is also oily.  This product left my skin feeling heavy and sticky.  I also live in southern TX where the humidity is extremely high.  I don&#x27;t plan to use this product again.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd bottle and I will continue to purchase this brand.  This lotion is very light and not greasy.  I also love that is contains sunscreen.  I may purchase the one that has an SPF 30 next time for added sun protection.  I&#x27;ve been buying this lotion through Amazon as I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in a few stores.</li>
    <li> I first heard about this product from my Aunt, who is 83 years old with lovely skin and an active mind and body.  Then I saw it in my dermatologist&#x27;s office and thought here&#x27;s a second good recommendation.  So I tried it and have been using it daily ever since.  I have fair, sensitive skin, and have used other skin and sunscreen products before, with varied results, but this one is definitely my favorite!</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for years! It&#x27;s very light-weight, not greasy, absorbs quickly into the skin and leaves your skin baby-soft with no tackiness. I also use it on my hands, which get very dry in the winter. I used the SPF 30 version in the summer, but it doesn&#x27;t absorb into my skin as well. (I know others who don&#x27;t have nay problem with the SPF 30 lotion.) I don&#x27;t know about the anti-wrinkle claims, but people do tell me that I look young for my age, so maybe it helps!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, it is mild and great moisturizer and it also offers SPF 15.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, works very well on face and neck.</li>
    <li> Best every day protection to facial skin. Not greasy and really gives the protection you are expecting.</li>
    <li> Sadly, this product doesn&#x27;t come close to the Q10 anti-wrinkle cream without sunscreen. There is no thick buttery texture, and it dries your skin out completely within days. I would recommend using the regular Q10 cream, which is SO awesome, and putting this on over it if you are going in the sun. I&#x27;m really disappointed and am stuck with two bottles of this stuff...</li>
    <li> I have used this product for at least ten years.  I&#x27;m always told I don&#x27;t look as old as I am which is 62.  The only problem I have is, this is all that I use on my face and it feels a little sticky and shiny.  Sometimes I do use a loose powder which helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years but could no longer get it at the retail stores.  I am so very happy to be able to get it via Amazon.com--and at a fair price too.  Problems with shipping the product were taken care of quickly and ended happily. Thanks for this excellent customer service.  I&#x27;ll be back for more when I need it.</li>
    <li> For me the lotion is too greasy for my face so I use it for hand lotion.  I also purchased the 2-pack of Eucerin Q10 Cream which is really good for the back of the hands and I will certainly use it for that.  However, the Q10 Anit-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Lotion is just too greasy for my face which is already oily.  I suppose for ladies with \\&quot;dry\\&quot; skin it would be a good thing.  But as I&#x27;ve said I will use it as a hand lotion</li>
    <li> This sensitive skin lotion is fabulous! I highly recommend it. It doesnt make my face red and it keeps my skin just moist enough for the entire day. I use the night cream and that works great too. What a great combo!</li>
    <li> I have been using Eucerin Q10 for years and love it.  Lightweight with 15 spf.  Perfect for every single day.  I wish more stores carried the Q10.</li>
    <li> I have been using this face cream forever and I love it!  Several years ago they stopped selling this particular one in stores so I have been ordering it online.  I think it&#x27;s for the better because the prices on Amazon are awesome!</li>
    <li> The product itself is fine but it is not what I ordered. I ordered the lotion for sensitive facial skin and was shipped the regular sensitive skin lotion.</li>
    <li> Shortly after this purchase, I had another item that was discontinued in the store and only available at Amazon. I am very concerned that Amazon is driving down prices and creating monopolies so it can then charge whatever it wants. It has already started to raise prices on some of its books according to recent news reports. I love this product, it is the only thing I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water, but will probably pay more to get it from another source next time, just to try to keep competition alive.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the last two years and love it.  Several of my girlfriends have even switched to it after they noticed how much younger my skin looked after using this product for several months.  This is saying a lot as my family tends to have creases that are very noticeable around our eye (crowfeet), between our brows, and on our foreheads.  I have oily to combo skin and am in my upper 40&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> My skin has always been very sensitive and I&#x27;m prone to break-outs of Eczema.  I have to use dye/perfume-free EVERYTHING.  My doctor suggested I try Eucerin lotion 15 years ago.  It was so soothing and healing I decided to give the facial moisturizer a try.  When I discovered Eucerin Sensitive Facial Skin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Lotion, SPF 15, I was blown away with how much younger my skin appeared.  I shared it with my best friend and now we wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere without it.  If I was stranded on a desert island I would want my Eucerin Lotion in my survival kit :o)</li>
    <li> it works! Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I think that this lotion is awesome!  I have finally found something that is affordable that I love!  I would recommend it to anyone.  I wish it was a 30 spf but I have not noticed any \\&quot;sunburns\\&quot; with it.  Still, if I am staying out in the sun, I will typically throw on additional sunscreen protection, something waterproof.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and still consider it my favorite.</li>
    <li> Of all the expensive facial creams and lotions on the market (and I have tried many), I still keep coming back to this one.  It&#x27;s very gentle with no scent.  It&#x27;s also great to use prior to putting on makeup and it&#x27;s great to use at bedtime.  It just gives you skin a softness without any residue or feeling of greasiness.  I also like to fact that the lotion has a SPF 15 to protect me when out in the sun.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great price on a great low scent, non-greasy lotion that protects well against the sun without the heavy feel of a sunscreen.  Also has the firming quality of the CO-Q10.</li>
    <li> I used this during the day for a couple months in conjunction with the Q10 night cream and it seemed to help soften the wrinkles I had started to notice.  Doesn&#x27;t aggravate my acne prone skin and I like this lotion better than the night cream since the consistency is light and absorbs well and the smell is very minimal (plain suntan/lotion smell).  Works fine under my makeup.  Would be great if they offered it with a slightly higher spf to last just a bit longer (since I don&#x27;t reapply over my makeup).</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous light weight lotion which can be applied all day if necessary.  I carry in my purse for a mid day application.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but worth every penny, I will continue using this product.</li>
    <li> This face moisturizer is very thin so you only need  a little to cover your face.  It has no scent.  It doesn&#x27;t make me breakout.  I like that it has an SPF in it.  I used to use an olay product and loved it. I used it for over 5 years, but then it started to make my face itch and get red.  So far, nothing negative to say about this one.  Face doesn&#x27;t feel tight after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have I noticed a big difference in m skin looking younger? No, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting to.  I do notice that my skin feels a little softer.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin. Everything makes me break out. I also have dry skin. This is the only product I can use that works and I don&#x27;t break out. I luv it and don&#x27;t know why it was pulled from my drugstore shelves but glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Along with their other skin care product, Nivea Original, I feel good about the appearance of my skin along with the complements.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It is the perfect item for my skin care regimen. It does not break me out. My skin is smooth and beautiful. I cannot find this item in the stores in my home town. So i was glad to know that it is on line.Good price too!</li>
    <li> i LOVE this product.  i have been buying it for years, but lately have had trouble finding it in the local stores.  i like this version, as it has Q-10 in it.  i really think it help smooth fine lines.  It is NOT greasy, it doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance, and a little goes a long way.  I have SUPER-SENSITIVE skin and I have never had a problem with this moisturizer.  It also does not clog your pores.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended Eucerin Q10 for Sensitive Skin some years ago, as my skin was seriously sun damaged.  This product helps to regenerate the collagen layer under the skin.  As a result of regular use on my arms and legs as well as my face, my skin is much healthier.  There is visible difference, with a reduction of wrinkles, and a much healthier appearance.  Additionally, my skin withstands bumps and nicks that used to break the skin and take weeks to heal.  I&#x27;d be lost without it, and recommend it to anyone with sun damaged or aging skin.</li>
    <li> This is the only true Facial skin Lotion that I have found, whether it&#x27;s in my mind or real. I notice the difference, when I don&#x27;t use it!&lt;br /&gt;Truely love it, yet can not find it in the stores!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 65 years young and have NO face wrinkles I feel this product is one of the reasons.</li>
    <li> I send this to my mom who has very sensitive skin. She loves it and she is using it everyday.</li>
    <li> This is one product that works, I buy the package , that you get 2. you save money on amazon, over buying it in the store retail</li>
    <li> Like this skin cream. Was recommended to me by my dermatologist. Also use it as SPF when I won&#x27;t be outdoors all that long.</li>
    <li> Good product and great price</li>
    <li> The good thing about this product is that it contains a pretty good antioxidant.  The packaging, a pump as opposed to an open jar, makes it so the product isn&#x27;t exposed to oxygen, so the antioxidents don&#x27;t break down and oxidize.  The product isn&#x27;t too greasy either, and I have cobination to oily skin.      Now my gripe with the product is that because it contains SPF 15, this will lull many consumers into thinking they are covered for sun protection.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not broad spectrum protection.  This product doesn&#x27;t contain titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, avobenzone, or one of many other ingredients that protect against UVA rays.  UVA rays cause skin cancer.  Many moisturizer with SPF do not contain broad spectrum protection, so make sure to check the labels.    Bottom line: This is a good, light moisturizer for sensitive skin.  Just be sure to use a full spectrum sunscreen along with the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Approaching 40, I figure I better start taking care of my skin. I was in a physician&#x27;s office and picked up a magazine that had some skin care \\&quot;secrets\\&quot;. it recommended daily moisturizer with coQ-10 and some sort of sunscreen for daily use. I looked at various products with these ingredients, but most were far too overpriced for 1 or 2 oz of product. They also made outrageous claims that your haggard, gnarly skin would turn into a \\&quot;baby&#x27;s bottom\\&quot;. Right?! I finally found the Eucerin brand on Amazon with the same ingredients in a 6 oz. bottle.     I will not claim that this product has changed my life, but I do feel better knowing I am compliant with dermatologist-recommended face lotion. My skin has remained clear, and maybe a fine line or two is less noticeable. Absorbs well and does not feel greasy. I use it twice per day.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my hands to help decrease hand wrinkles and improve the elasticity of the hands.  It also leaves them glistening with hydration.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and people tell me I look fabulous for my age.  This lotion is cheap and effective and absorbs into the skin immediately.  I&#x27;ve tried other expensive creams and they don&#x27;t work as well as this one.</li>
    <li> Works incredibly well under make-up! Gives you the needed moisture without a heavy feel. SPF is a definite plus. A bit of an odor but it fades fast :)&lt;br /&gt;This is a Daytime use lotion.............use something heavy (such as Burt&#x27;s Bee Night Cream) before bed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for several years. It is the best one for sensitive skin that I&#x27;ve ever used. Another plus is the reasonable cost.</li>
    <li> Works effectively as a suncscreen.  Also a great moisturizer.  Sinks right into skin quickly.  Non perfumed which I like.  Have tried comparable products from other companies but didn&#x27;t like them as much and went right back to Eucerin which I&#x27;ve been using for several years.</li>
    <li> It feels good at first, but I stopped usage because that my skin was a little allergic to that. That might be a problem from myself</li>
    <li> This is a great daytime moisturizer and has SPF 15.  My skin, even in Michigan winters, stays soft and lubricated all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and I have an innate feeling it will work well in the summer, but it does make you face pale looking, so I would opt for this product with a tint to it so you don&#x27;t look pasty.  Not Amazon&#x27;s or Company fault, but I&#x27;ve never used sunblock on my face, so I didn&#x27;t know.  Now I do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it a 3 stars because of the pale look it gives to your skin.  I  WILL CONTACT THE COMPANY AND SEE IF THEY  CAN EXCHANGE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/15/13  This company, per their representative doesn&#x27;t make a flesh color tint to it, so maybe another brand will, unless you want to have a whitish look to your face or cover that with a foundation!</li>
    <li> No noticable smell, spf protection is good and it does not make me feel oily but it seems my skin has been breaking out more since using it. Might just take time to get used to it but the spf protection not being oily is worth dealing with a little acne.</li>
    <li> I live on a small farm on top of a hill that exposes me to a lot of wind and weather so I need something to add moisture to my skin.  This product is exceptional - it not only adds moisture to the skin, but also includes SPF protection.  It is also long lasting as  little goes a long way.  It is non-greasy and absorbs quickly.  Outstanding product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fragrance free but my sensitive nose can smell something similar to suntan lotion and it is SPF15 so that makes sense ;)  I normally use the heavier Eucerin Sensitive Facial Skin Q10 Anti-Wrinkle Sensitive Skin Creme at night but during the summer I find it&#x27;s just too heavy so I switch over to the lotion even though I smell like I&#x27;m going to the beach but I&#x27;m actually going to bed ;) I love the fact that there&#x27;s a choice between the creme and the lotion but the quality &amp; sensitive skin features are the same.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I use it under makeup.  Great wrinkle reducer. Goes on smoothly it is not too thick. The sensitive lotion works well!</li>
    <li> I first bought this a couple of years ago at 20 just because I was looking for my other eucerin lotion and figured that an anti-wrinkle one couldn&#x27;t hurt, even if I wasn&#x27;t exactly old. Now that it&#x27;s run out and I bought a regular one I&#x27;ve realized that the anti-wrinkle actually made my skin look better under my makeup much better than the regular moisturizing eucerin lotion.</li>
    <li> Great product, no smell, feels light on skin and is soaked in quickly. would recomend this to a friend if they had sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I have not had this long. I am using it. I take Q10 on a regular basis and I am happy to have found it in a lotion too. I heard about this on the Dr Oz show. One of the plastic surgeon&#x27;s said if you use anything get a facial lotion with Q10. He said it really works  So I am trying it</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and thought that I would be able to use this product but I couldn&#x27;t.  Although I did not use it on or around my eyes they still got all puffy and dry and itchy.  Now I have 2 bottles that I can&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial moisturizer with sunscreen that I&#x27;ve used. It goes on really light and absorbs quickly. A shame that it&#x27;s all but impossible to find in stores anymore. All they sell now is the 30 spf moisturizer, which I find is heavier and more difficult to absorb.</li>
    <li> Not sure if the wrinkle part works yet, but the lotion part is awesome.  I have super sensitive skin, and even sensitive items don&#x27;t work for me - this does :) I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> I use this product every day, it gives me good protection for my face, it is not expensive as some of the products out there.</li>
    <li> This works better that stated. My face is so soft and much firmer. I am 42 yrs old and my face finally feels like it did in my 20&#x27;s. less acne ontop of it too. I have only been using it about 2 weeks and its perfect. I would highly recommend this to anyone any age group. It&#x27;s awesome! USE it and see for yourself. I will continue to purchase it from amazon!</li>
    <li> I have only had this a few days. It is greasy to a degree; but only going on. Makes skin smooth. I even used it on my arms and legs! ...very dry skin. I cannot comment yet if it has anti-wrinkle properties since I have not used it long enough. I got the two pack and am very pleased! It has a very nice top on it if that matters to you, the pointed type; so you don&#x27;t pour out too much at once. This is a great point in my opinion since you don&#x27;t waste it like some creams. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love the light texture. It absorbs very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for everyday use. I will buy again. The deal is also awesome.</li>
    <li> There are so many choices and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them. This was a great, reasonably priced lotion that I use every day.</li>
    <li> No need to spend ridiculous amounts of money on moisturizer. I use the lotion during the day, the cream at night. Both are fantastic. My skin is sensitive and neither causes breakouts. I also really dislike perfumed products. The lotion is light and does not smell at all. The cream has an extremely faint smell of vanilla frosting - however, it smells nice and not chemical-ly at all.</li>
