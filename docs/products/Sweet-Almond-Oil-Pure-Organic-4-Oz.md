      <li>mixed with other oils for hair, really leaves shiny and manageable, like this brand oils for hair, also used on skin made it moist and soft!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think these oils are the real deal! Will not buy again</li>
    <li> I cannot say much for now because I haven&#x27;t put it to much use except for combining it with another oil for my hair. I am not sure if it is the Almond or Avocado oil that made my hair so shiny, soft and manageable.  Ask me again later cause I might try it alone to see if I will get the same result.  But this oil is good regardless.  Glad I made the purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I use this oil in my hair regimen. This oil is very affordable and the shipping was very fast too. I plann to purchase more of it.</li>
    <li> I give this oil 5 stars because I love it afterwards-reaction. It&#x27;s does not flake. I use this oil along with other oils such as olive oil and coconut oil. The three make the perfect moisturizer and sealant for my natural hair. I would recommend this oil to black people with natural hair.</li>
    <li> I thought this oil was very thin compared with other sweet almond oil I have purchased. Almost like something else had been added. Paler colour like water had been added.</li>
    <li> When I first got the product it had weird residue floating around in it. I have my doubts if this is even real almond oil. It was really greasy too. I use this in my turmeric mask and it just doesn&#x27;t give me the same results as my last bottle of almond oil. I will definitely not recommend or buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Great product thanks it does what I intended and looking forward to different uses for this product. yay yay yay</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because of the bad reaction I had with this. I don&#x27;t believe there is anything wrong with this oil. Seemed nice, but made me break out. Anyone with allergies or sensitive skin should test first on a patch of skin. Shipped very very fast. Would buy other oils from seller again</li>
    <li> not even a hint of almond smell in which i was hoping for but i luv how light it is!</li>
    <li> bought it for my sister..and she loves it..she is ordering five more bottles..gives hair a natural healthy shine...fan for life</li>
    <li> Wanted to try this oil on salads. The size was perfect to sample it a few times. Was very delicious.</li>
    <li> This pure organic oil arrived quickly and was everything I look for in an almond oil.  It was important to me that it was organic, as the oil washes that I am creating have to be chemical free.  It is one of many ingredients I use in making a body butter.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Great carrier oil for many uses, I used this in my natural hair concoction and it works just fine! Absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy! Excellent moisturizer to include with natural hair care!</li>
    <li> This site is absolutely wonderful. And there products are cost friendly. I order this oil because I use is constantly the quality was great!!!</li>
    <li> good carrier oil, decent quality and no complaints so far</li>
    <li> mixed with other oils for hair, really leaves shiny and manageable, like this brand oils for hair, also used on skin made it moist and soft!</li>
    <li> this oil is great, not too thick and not too runny. i use it for the oil cleansing method and so far this has worked great on my skin.</li>
    <li> was hoping for a more fragrant oil. I wanted to use the almond along with the cherry kernel for a good aroma skin oil. It doesn&#x27;t really have an aroma. This was a part of what I was trying to do naturally with a very difficult skin condition that regular Dr&#x27;s have just said &#x27;interesting..&#x27; for the past 11 months.&lt;br /&gt;I will say I did not contact the seller as it has been a particularly difficult time for me healthwise. All of this was ordered in an effort to help with an ongoing skin condition that started 11 months ago. The regular Dr&#x27;s could not figure out so I was looking for a natural alternative.</li>
    <li> I sarted making my own oils and bath soaps and this goes a long way. I was concerned about spending that much on this one product however I have had it for three months and have only needed to use a third of the bottle.</li>
    <li> i purchased this product because i have thick long locks and wanted them not look dull and dry....this product helps a lot...</li>
    <li> Great company, products, and brand!</li>
    <li> It was just what I wanted and it is as described. It is a nice light oil. I am using it on my dry lips.</li>
    <li> Will never use....doesn&#x27;t smell anything like almond oil</li>
    <li> Very light and amazing on my skin</li>
    <li> Nice aroma. I use this in my beard oil mixture.</li>
    <li> WORST experience ever.</li>
    <li> I love using this on my face and scalp. It is a very light oil- not too greasy. It absorbs really well. They say you shouldn&#x27;t use it if you have any nut allergies- otherwise enjoy!</li>
