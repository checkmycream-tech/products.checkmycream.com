      <li>My favorite makeup!</li>
      <li>I also love the convenience that it arrives at my door in two days!  </li>
      <li>And at a great price I would recommend this product to anyone and it shipped really quick</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with the product, just did not receive the right color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a powder finish.  </li>
      <li>this makeup didn&#x27;t stay on and the applicator was more plastic</li>
      <li>Love the MAC makeup.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for answering my questions all came in time thank you very much all excellent.</li>
      <li>Obviously I loved the product, as I have purchased it many times over... not from this seller, however, for the product they sent me was chunky in consistency and varied in color, standing out on my face and making me look like I applied FAR more than I did.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t back too many things, but I&#x27;ve worn MAC for years, and I will never stop! :)</li>
      <li>The package said delivered 3 days before it actually was delivered to my house, however, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>Brand new and exactly what I needed!</li>
      <li>so in reality i spent more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried every make up out there, and this is the ONLY make up that I have used that did not cake up on me, did not put make up lines on my face, and literally if I had to wear it 24 hrs,it would look just as fresh 24 hrs than it did when I put it on.</li>
      <li>I just want you all to know, I have been working as a professional makeup artist with a makeup company for over 8 years (I technically can&#x27;t say, but it rhymes with *snack* ;) )</li>
      <li>I am so disappointed at first thought what a great buy</li>
      <li>but this product doesn&#x27;t feel or look like the Studio Fix I buy directly from MAC.  </li>
      <li>A separate layer of white powder would float to the top of my makeup application after a few hours.</li>
      <li>Remember, cheaper doesn&#x27;t always mean better.</li>
      <li>The first few applications I noticed the makeup separating as soon as it was applied on my face.</li>

<li> The first few applications I noticed the makeup separating as soon as it was applied on my face.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but the makeup did not have it&#x27;s usual smooth finish.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve purchased this exact foundation multiple times from a kiosk in a department store that is now, unfortunately, too far from me to be convenient.</li>
<li> but when I opened the product noticed something different took it to the mac counter at Nordstrom to find out the product was not real...</li>
<li> I had recently gotten color matched at a MAC store and this was not a true to color MAC product..</li>
<li> It was everything I expected.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure this actually affects the products ability to fully cover.</li>
<li> Not very easy to use when power is all messed up and compact</li>
<li> However, the formula is different than the actual studio fix powders, I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s a well made fake.</li>
<li> Now that I&#x27;ve gone a little deeper into the compact, the problem seems to have corrected itself.</li>
<li> To spare you all the trouble, if you do not buy it directly from a M.A.C store, counter or from their official website, it usually is, 9 times out of 10 fake.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure who&#x27;s fault</li>
<li> I have purchased MAC products faithfully in the past.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m assuming the reason behind the bad product is that they are either shipping out old makeup or the storage conditions are unsuitable to their product.</li>
<li> compact was broken when I recieved it.</li>
<li> It is horrible and I wish I could get my money back!</li>
<li> Not saying that the pictured product is fake, but after reading the negatives reviews, it probably is.</li>
<li> If I am completely wrong, I apologize to the sender.  </li>
<li> This batch was unfortunately flawed.</li>
<li> I was wrong.  </li>
<li> I hate to think I was sent fake MAC Makeup</li>
<li> It&#x27;s just been this one occasion where I have been truly disappointed.</li>
<li> I contacted the seller and they had terrible customer service.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s MAC and it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed at first thought what a great buy but when I opened the product noticed something different took it to the mac counter at Nordstrom to find out the product was not real... The powder had a glittery finish and looked almost orange... Do not purchase!</li>
    <li> I am so dissapointed, I purchased this thinking this is a great sale price, says its my Mac Studio Fix NC25 recieved it and the product is not what is is said to be. It is horrible and I wish I could get my money back!</li>
    <li> The package said delivered 3 days before it actually was delivered to my house, however, I&#x27;m completely satisfied with the product. Brand new and exactly what I needed!</li>
    <li> compact was broken when I recieved it. Box was in mint condition. Not very easy to use when power is all messed up and compact wont shut every.</li>
    <li> Thanks for answering my questions all came in time thank you very much all excellent.</li>
    <li> I hate to think I was sent fake MAC Makeup but this product doesn&#x27;t feel or look like the Studio Fix I buy directly from MAC.  It seems like it must have expired.  If I am completely wrong, I apologize to the sender.  The only reason I am reviewing is because of the pressure to review on amazon.  I would rather write a good review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every make up out there, and this is the ONLY make up that I have used that did not cake up on me, did not put make up lines on my face, and literally if I had to wear it 24 hrs,it would look just as fresh 24 hrs than it did when I put it on. I don&#x27;t back too many things, but I&#x27;ve worn MAC for years, and I will never stop! :)</li>
    <li> I love it!!!  I will definitely be buying from here again!!!  It was a great price for a great product!!!</li>
    <li> This product would seem almost perfect. However, the formula is different than the actual studio fix powders, I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s a well made fake.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure who&#x27;s fault it was, but I was under the impression that it was a cream to power finish.  I was wrong.  It&#x27;s more of a powder finish.  If you want the cream to powder look you need to go with the Studio Tech ( not Studio Fix)</li>
    <li> this makeup didn&#x27;t stay on and the applicator was more plastic I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.  In fact i ended up going to a MAC seller and purchasing it for the regular price so in reality i spent more.</li>
    <li> I have purchased MAC products faithfully in the past. This batch was unfortunately flawed. I&#x27;m not sure why, but the makeup did not have it&#x27;s usual smooth finish. It looks like it became granulated after it was poured into the compact. I&#x27;m not sure this actually affects the products ability to fully cover. The first few applications I noticed the makeup separating as soon as it was applied on my face. A separate layer of white powder would float to the top of my makeup application after a few hours. Now that I&#x27;ve gone a little deeper into the compact, the problem seems to have corrected itself. I will probably purchase MAC products again. I am usually very happy. It&#x27;s just been this one occasion where I have been truly disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product, just did not receive the right color. However I have been making it work when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Love the MAC makeup.  I also love the convenience that it arrives at my door in two days!  You cannot beat that!</li>
    <li> awesome for my daughter</li>
    <li> Awesome product, great price.</li>
    <li> My favorite makeup! And at a great price I would recommend this product to anyone and it shipped really quick I received it within 5 days of ordering</li>
    <li> It was everything I expected. It´s all. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.</li>
    <li> I just want you all to know, I have been working as a professional makeup artist with a makeup company for over 8 years (I technically can&#x27;t say, but it rhymes with *snack* ;) ) To spare you all the trouble, if you do not buy it directly from a M.A.C store, counter or from their official website, it usually is, 9 times out of 10 fake. Not saying that the pictured product is fake, but after reading the negatives reviews, it probably is. Remember, cheaper doesn&#x27;t always mean better.</li>

I&#x27;m assuming the reason behind the bad product is that they are either shipping out old makeup or the storage conditions are unsuitable to their product. Either way, they will not find a return in me...</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the  Mac Studio Fix Powder Plus Foundation in NC25 From Mainland Trading.  The color did not match my skin.  It was about 2-3 shades darker and orange.  I had recently gotten color matched at a MAC store and this was not a true to color MAC product.. I contacted the seller and they had terrible customer service.  No apologies from then and they actually had the nerve to charge me a $7 restocking fee to return the item. I will never order from this company again.</li>
