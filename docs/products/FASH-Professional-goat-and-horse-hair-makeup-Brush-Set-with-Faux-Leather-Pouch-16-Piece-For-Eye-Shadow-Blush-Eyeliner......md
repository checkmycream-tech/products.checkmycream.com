      <li>They clean very easily and are quite sturdy for cosmetic brushes.</li>
      <li>After having done my research and finding out that brushes with animal hair is potentially more high quality, I was delighted to find this product from FASH.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s defiantly worth buying! &#x3D;]</li>
      <li>This set come with foldable pouch to keeps everything in place and easy to carry around.</li>
      <li>I ordered this brush set for the brushes not the pouch that the brushes come in, I just wanted to make that very clear before someone misunderstands this review, and again, the brushes are wonderful - very soft and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the hairs coming</li>
      <li>They seem to work more effectively than my old brushes.  </li>
      <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>wish the overlap cover for the brushes   is not made of cheap plastic but atleast vinyl or something.  </li>
      <li>Thanks! :)</li>
      <li>You just have to use a more fragrant shampoo for the first rinse because it has a bit of a glue smell.</li>
      <li>And the brushes made application super easy and quick.</li>
      <li>For my first time buy and the price of the brushes, I can fairly say that I was overall satisfied.  </li>
      <li>I love playing around with all the different sizes, especially the eye ones :) They have never shed, which is a HUGE plus!!!</li>
      <li>each brush comes with a nice clear cover to keep it clean and the hairs in place.</li>
      <li>I love these better than my bare minerals brushes....</li>
      <li>Makes travel easy and being able to keep my brushes clean is a big deal to me.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for new makeup brushes but didn&#x27;t want to pay top dollar for them</li>
      <li>And will all those washes they still feel and look brand new :)</li>
      <li>Super cute and soft.</li>
      <li>and I love that they&#x27;re natural eco-friendly brushes.</li>
      <li>I have already ordered another set for my 15 year old daughter as a surprise for her birthday which I know she&#x27;ll love.</li>
      <li>They have not shead after washing and are soft enough that they don&#x27;t bother my skin the eyeshadow brushes are great.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth what i paid for.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s nice to have something that is built to last</li>
      <li>I love them so far.</li>
      <li>When I saw this set, I felt that these were just right for me (</li>

      <li>I love all the different sizes.</li>
      <li>being that it was my first time trying brushes).  </li>
      <li>The first few weeks, they were pretty good.</li>
      <li>This is the first time that I have ever used brushes to apply my makeup and I decided to give it a go.  </li>
      <li>I would buy brushes from the company again but simply to see if their synthetic brushes hold together better.</li>
      <li>but just so buyers are aware - the logo is just a sticker.</li>
      <li>out\\&quot; before use the first time.</li>
      <li>They are SOFT, SMOOTH , &amp; they have every style of brush you could use or want.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like these brushes.  They seem to work more effectively than my old brushes.  The hairs shed a tiny bit at first, but after using them a couple of times, they no longer shed.  It came packaged very well also.</li>
    <li> The brushes were Okay. I noticed that some of the hairs from the bigger brushes fell out a bit.  The quality was actually really good, though. And the brushes made application super easy and quick. Now I take about 5 minutes putting on my make-up in the mornings.  It&#x27;s defiantly worth buying! &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> With the FASH UK 2011 Series Cosmetic Brush Set with Faux Leather Pouch, Goat and Horse, 16-Piece, I could not ask for more. Each brush is amazing and perfectly made - the tips of the brushes are nicely soft. I love the carrying case as well! Thanks! :)</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m going to make this short and sweet.   I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for about 2 months now.   Overall they are good quality, with very minimal shedding.   I owned a small brush set previously that I purchased from BH cosmetics. It was a more expensive set, but it also came with fewer brushes.   The brush hair on this set in comparison to my older set is a lot more corse, not the best feeling to put on your face. (FACE BRUSHES ONLY. *side note*I do have pretty sensitive skin) as far as the eye brushes they are very dense and i like using them more than my more expensive brushes.   Over all good price for what you get.   I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure on the looks just from the pics online, but when I received them I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I was!!  They are soft and versatile...and I have my friends asking how they can get the set.  Makes travel easy and being able to keep my brushes clean is a big deal to me.  I would recommend this to everyone who is looking for a quality brush set and a hygienic way to transport them!</li>
    <li> great set.  Been using it about 6 weeks now.  Brushes are in good shape and I love the cute case!</li>
    <li> I got this brush set for my sister for christmas and she loves it! im thinking of getting one for myself.</li>
    <li> I was looking for new makeup brushes but didn&#x27;t want to pay top dollar for them (I&#x27;m not a makeup artist)and this set fits the bill it comes with almost every brush I was looking for and a few that are just nice to have to play around with. They have not shead after washing and are soft enough that they don&#x27;t bother my skin the eyeshadow brushes are great. I love all the different sizes. I would recomend buying this product to anyone who is looking for a good brush set at a great price point.</li>
    <li> I was a little edgy about buying this. I&#x27;ve looked for other brush sets and couldn&#x27;t find one That was eithier in my price range or ones that will last me awhile. I usually go to target for everything I buy. So when I seen how much the brush sets were I almost cried. It&#x27;s insane how much Stores will cost you. But Fash oh fash..I&#x27;m so glad I came on Amazon and looked. I&#x27;m very pleased with my Brush set. They are SOFT, SMOOTH , &amp; they have every style of brush you could use or want. It&#x27;s nice to have such a big variety. The brushes are on the \\&quot;stick if you will\\&quot; Nice and snug. Others talked about them having an odor. I for one didn&#x27;t smell a thing. I would have to say I use my brush set almost everyday. This is the only brush set that I haven&#x27;t had to shampoo and Condition. (Some say if you shampoo and condition prior to using the brush won&#x27;t flake off) I wash my set with water everytime after I use them. To make sure I get the makeup off. And will all those washes they still feel and look brand new :)</li>
    <li> Brushes came in 6 days, the package was cheesy looking but feels like it will hold up.&lt;br /&gt;Used the brushes for almost a week now, they are awesome.&lt;br /&gt;All the face brushes are soft and great, I will warn that the eyeshadow brushes are a little bit rougher than my ecotools.&lt;br /&gt;In the end I will use all the brushes, they are a great buy for someone who wants to update their brushes.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! The brushes r super soft and hold pigment, but they do shed a lot, and get out of shape. I still love em though!</li>
    <li> These are the best brushes I have ever owned. They are super super soft! Feels so silky on my skin. I love playing around with all the different sizes, especially the eye ones :) They have never shed, which is a HUGE plus!!! I would reccomend these to anyone, professional or not.</li>
    <li> i got this and thought that it would have a real label on it and it was a sitcker on the front. it is very plastic (the packaging). when i opened it, it had a very cheap plastic smell on it. when i did look at the brushes and feel them...... the only soft one was the eyeliner brush and the fan brush shed from the very beggining i took the plastic case off it. i mean for the money u pay i should have exspected crappy brushes.but the hair for the brushes are not soft at all. but i guess u get what you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It could be because of the brush set that i bought, but i was not very pleased with this set. The presentation of the brushes was great. The actual brush itself that actually picks of the shadows was very low quality. The brush hairs were not tightly put together like those of a MAC or Sigma brush and the brushes shed, not excessively though. I have not washed the brushes yet and the only ones i have used are the angled blush brush and the small eyeshadow brushes (those were not good at picking up eyeshadow; Elf brushes work better). The bigger eye shadow brushes are too big. My favorite brush would have to be the angled blush brush and the eyebrow brush. I would buy brushes from the company again but simply to see if their synthetic brushes hold together better. Hopefully i can give a better review on those.</li>
    <li> i got this for my teenage niece.  nice brushes.  cute case.  great price.  i don&#x27;t see any downside.  i think anyone who wears makeup would appreciate one of these sets -- i would!</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes for my mother-in-law as part of her Christmas gift. She has been hinting for weeks now that she wanted them so I decided to get these. I washed them in warm water with baby oil prior to her first use. They do not shed, they are soft &amp; easy to hold, come in a great pouch that protects them and they are great on her skin. I took her to buy make up and now she has these brushes to play with. She couldn&#x27;t be more content with them! Anyone looking for starter brushes I highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> good  1. the brush is not too soft not hard atleast  2. the carry case is nice and fancy  bad  1. it arrived so late  2. wish the overlap cover for the brushes   is not made of cheap plastic but atleast vinyl or something.  all in all it&#x27;s worth what i paid for.</li>
    <li> These brushes were very rough, not soft at all. My eyes were always red after using them, I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> After having done my research and finding out that brushes with animal hair is potentially more high quality, I was delighted to find this product from FASH. Being a goat and horse hair combination, I think the product is a steal! The case is much bigger than what I expected and the brushes are durable and very professional looking! It helps me out to apply my make up easily:) You just have to use a more fragrant shampoo for the first rinse because it has a bit of a glue smell. It&#x27;s not that bothersome though and performs to my satisfaction! I recommend this set for yourself of for a gift. It&#x27;s really nicely assembled and stylish!</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery, great product. No hairs have fallen out. Super soft on my face. Great at picking up pigment from my powders. I love these better than my bare minerals brushes....</li>
    <li> Unbelievable - so worth it.  I dont know how long they will last - but, they are only 10% of the cost I usually pay too!  They look great and work great - so I am happy.</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I have ever used brushes to apply my makeup and I decided to give it a go.  When I saw this set, I felt that these were just right for me (being that it was my first time trying brushes).  I am not able to compare them to any other brush sets, but from using them I can give a little feedback of how I feel about them.  The brushes seemed to have done the job for me.  Although, there is a very strong smell that the pouch does have (which gave me a headache).  I did try to air it out, but it does still linger on there and it lingers on the brushes as well (of course I washed the brushes prior to using).  The brushes are fairly soft.  One thing that I do wish that was added to the brushes is a list of which brush should be used for what; I guess it is a personal preference, but when I tried to apply my foundation with one of the brushes, I did not like how it went on.  Yet, this could be my doing and not the brush itself.  For my first time buy and the price of the brushes, I can fairly say that I was overall satisfied.  They seem to be strong and durable (no brush hair left behind yet). I am still experimenting with them and trying to figure out which is which and I am having fun doing so.</li>
    <li> The Fash Uk Cosmetic Brush Set I ordered arrived within a few days. I loved the case they came in and all the brushes looked great. They&#x27;re very soft, and easy to use. They clean very easily and are quite sturdy for cosmetic brushes. The case makes it convenient to pack and carry for traveling.    I&#x27;ve used them quite often since I got them. I have recommended the cosmetic brush set to friends and family. It&#x27;s a great product and I love that they&#x27;re natural eco-friendly brushes. It&#x27;s nice to have something that is built to last and that is convenient to use as well. I have already ordered another set for my 15 year old daughter as a surprise for her birthday which I know she&#x27;ll love.</li>
    <li> wouldn&#x27;t waste your money. the brushes shed bad, they will leave hair on your face. the eyeshadow brushes are hard to work with, they dont hold the eyeshadow very well and they will wipe away the eye shadow. the brushes should be alot softer. very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased when I received them in the mail and once I used them they were wonderful. The quality of the brushes is very good and the price is perfect. I will definitely be using this company again in the future for my make-up needs. Thanks for the quality product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for maybe a year now, but i hate them now.The first few weeks, they were pretty good. Now all they do is shed. Shed, shed, shed.I would definitly NOT repurchase of recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> I purchased the FASH Cosmetic Brush set for my daughter for Christmas.  She really likes it because of the great variety of brushes and stylish case.  I like the set because it was a great deal.</li>
    <li> my daughter get this for start practice her make up  and I recommended buy this  have more brushes and have quality</li>
    <li> Theese brushes are awesome! Super cute and soft. Great quality-obviously not as amazing as $200 brushes but there isn&#x27;t that much of a difference. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The brushes are very nice quality and i couldn&#x27;t think of any brush that you could need above and beyond this set.  The only complaint is that there was a strong odor when the item was first opened up.  We had to \\&quot;air it out\\&quot; before use the first time.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!!! the packaging it comes it is soo cute and sturdy. each brush comes with a nice clear cover to keep it clean and the hairs in place. they do have a bit of a smell but that&#x27;s only because of the material the case is made out of (faux leather). the brushes are soft  on the skin yet sturdy and pick up the perfect amount of product. i absolutely love them! as soon as i got them i washed them but only because that&#x27;s how i care for my brushes. i would definitely recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> The brushes came very fast. Even though I have over ten Mac brushes. I wanted to have a complete set. I washed them with my Mac brush clearner and they still kept their shape. I love them so far.</li>
    <li> This brush set was a great price and has so far held up well just a few bristles lost out of the foundation brush. Good quality for the money.</li>
    <li> Well, I haven&#x27;t used them yet but was very dissapointed to learn that they are nothing like the picture. The ones I got aren&#x27;t white and they have no pattern on the inside of the bag like the picture shows.. They aren&#x27;t very soft and the bag smells like paint.. I haven&#x27;t used or washed them yet but I have a feeling that they aren&#x27;t going to be great brushes..</li>
    <li> Well made brushes.  Expansive choice.  Easy to clean.  And as a University of Alabama fanatic, love the houndstooth case.  Highly recommend, great value.</li>
    <li> They look really nice but when I try them out. The eyeshadows brush pokes my eyes while applying eyeshadow.  I regret choosing this one.</li>
    <li> perfecto gift for the niece, she loves it, and well constructed for heavy use, shes learning new techniques and is going well</li>
    <li> People who pay this little for a full set of makeup brushes and expect makeup-artist-quality are only fooling themselves. I washed the brushes immediately (according to instructions), and store them out in the air (instead of in the case, which i would recommend). I experienced some shedding in the beginning, and even some continued now -- I&#x27;m a few months into ownership -- but nothing outrageous. The brushes pick up and hold powders well, and there is one for my everyday makeup requirements. This is a great value with high-quality brushes for the price, just don&#x27;t expect them to be on par with brushes that cost $30 each in some makeup store. I&#x27;m very glad that these are the ones I bought, and would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> This brush set was not very good and all the bristles keep coming off no matter how gentle you are when you apply makeup with them..Cheap is a good word.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush set for the brushes not the pouch that the brushes come in, I just wanted to make that very clear before someone misunderstands this review, and again, the brushes are wonderful - very soft and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the hairs coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;FASH&#x27; logo on the pouch is just a sticker - just fyi. If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;re ordering this for the brushes anyway and it won&#x27;t make a difference but just so buyers are aware - the logo is just a sticker.</li>
    <li> This kit carries all the brushes you needs.Made from genuine hair and nice materials.This set come with foldable pouch to keeps everything in place and easy to carry around.Final words..I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
