      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other things that were far better.</li>

    <li> I love this. it makes my skin soft and look refreshed over night. a little goes a long way. i&#x27;ve had this night cream for a while now and I&#x27;ve barely used half.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Makes my face glow.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this would hydrate and renew my skin, but when I get up in the morning, my lines almost seem worse. I&#x27;ve tried other things that were far better.</li>
    <li> love this cream, so hard to find now. creamy and nice scent. good for dry skin</li>
    <li> It feels great, but need more time to see results.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 7 months now~I am 60 yrs old~have very dry skin, have used creams that cost 4 times more than this~ But this works better for me better than any of those ~My skin is so dry~this puts the moisture back into my skin~&lt;br /&gt; I use this as well as the day cream &amp; the cocktail~love them all~I am told that I don&#x27;t look near my age~I owe it to Philosophy &amp; Lumene products</li>
    <li> I really like Lumene brand Bright Now moisturizers, but I mistakenly ordered this one. Even though this has a thick, creamy texture, it clogs my pores. No matter how little I put on at night, when I wake up in the morning I have pimples from it. I will be careful from now on to get the Bright Now formula.</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying any of Lumene&#x27;s products. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised and can&#x27;t wait to try something else. This is a great under-eye moisturizer. I use it every night before bed. It does have some fragrance, so that&#x27;s why I just focus on around my eyes w/it. It soaks into my skin nicely, not sticky or tacky at all. Just a great product.. I only picked this up because I&#x27;m starting to get fine lines/wrinkles around the eye area and those wrinkles tend to be very dry. I was having a hard time finding something that would heal and prevent that dry skin around my eyes..but after using this for not even a week, my eyes are finally back to normal no dry flaky skin! Thank goodness, I&#x27;m 30 &amp; was looking much, much older in the eyes. Also, I&#x27;m not absolutely positive but I think my under-eyes actually aren&#x27;t as dark too. I see such a difference, I look young &amp; healthy again. I truly recommend this night moisturizer/cream. Oh, and it was only $3.99 at cvs for a small container, the container looks tiny but this will last me six good months. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Love this night cream. Your face feel&#x27;s so good after applying..Have the day cream also and your face glows after the first use.</li>
    <li> Great smelling product that works well.  Not expecting a miracle at my age, but I see an improvement in my skin after using it.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> My skin looks brighter, feels younger and is much more hydrated after using this product even just a few days. You feel it work and it smells great. Vitamin C works well for me and I sleep better after putting it on :)</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this caused my rosacea to flare up with in minutes of putting it on for the first time. Even after washing it off with cool water and applying my rosacea medication my face is still on fire. It might be a good product for people with \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those with super-sensitive skin. I should have known better.</li>
    <li> Why did I buy Lumene? There are so many other products on the market, but when I saw Lumene for the first time at a local CVS, I was attracted to the word Arctic, stamped on all their products. But moreover, I remembered that Finland often comes first in global competitions in education and civility, and that&#x27;s what persuaded me to buy their products. If Finland is one of the most disciplined and civilized of the world&#x27;s countries, their facial products would probably be good, too, and honest.&lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed. Their products--this and others--are wonderful. They hydrate the skin thoroughly, they are light rather than greasy, and they smell beautifully--an Arctic special treatment.</li>
    <li> Lumene night cream is wonderful.  It is so creamy you don&#x27;t need much.  I also use the day cream with the Vitamin C and Lumene Vitamin C+ Dry Skin Comfort Radiance Cocktail.  I really like Lumene products.</li>
    <li> This stuff is luscious.  It&#x27;s like putting whipped cream on your face and I feel really hydrated and silky</li>
    <li> ok  did not change  anything on  my skin  after all the reviews  i was very surprised  --I am very dry  soory  i always try to take care of my skin  especially  my face  I will stick with  Lore&#x27;l  it has always done a good job  and i use  Marilyn Miguel  on HSN  cost about the same  Lore&#x27;i is a lot  less expensive  and  u can get  some of them of Amazon  and delivered to your door</li>
    <li> I have been using this night cream on those mini frown lines between the eyes. The cream is highly emollient &amp; glides right on, only a tiny amount is required. My skin absolutely LOVES Lumene cream, &amp; I have the type of skin that itches or turns red &amp; blotchy no matter what I use.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a Clinique girl for ages but my skin has matured &amp; seems to be asking for more. Lumene has worked for me, plus it provides a lovely, moist glow. I am 62 but my skin looks WAY younger.&lt;br /&gt;Try this. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed. My skin feels calm, refreshed, &amp; comforted with Lumene on!</li>
    <li> I love both the day and night creams from Lumene. It works great for my skin!</li>
    <li> Best night cream I have ever used.</li>
    <li> My over 50 face is treated EVERY NIGHT to a healthy dollop of Lumene Vitamin C Pure Radiance Night Cream immediately after my bedtime prep shower.  I vainly panicked when my local CVS, for some unknown reason, quit stocking this wonderful complexion product and I was without its rich, healing powers for 6 weeks!  THANK YOU AMAZON!!!  It moisturizes with a soft, refreshing feel, possesses a fresh citric acid fragrance, and leaves my rosacea prone (Irish redhead grandmother) skin silky smooth... not at all greasy.  My sun damaged skin (My arrogant generation rolled their eyes at possible UV damage warnings and bathed unprotected in the Southern&#x27;s Sun&#x27;s skin cell searing rays.) is much brighter and looks nourished.  I just wish it came in larger jars (Small to keep the vitamin C properties actively vibrant?) and were a wee bit less expensive, but as is this night cream is worth every penny wise (Looked so sun kissed golden as a teen.) pound foolish (Paying to prevent the old shoe leather look now.) cent.</li>
    <li> I use this during the day. Really brightens my skin! I can&#x27;t find anything comparable... I order more when I get close to running out. Keep it in my purse for when I need a refresher and I don&#x27;t use makeup on my skin- just the Lumene. It FEELS great, too. I am 48 and have been using Lumene for atleast 4 years now</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d purchased this as gift for my sister in law who asked for it specifically so I only have that to go by.</li>
    <li> My skin drinks it in and has improved so much after such&lt;br /&gt;a horrid winter of dryness...so glad I found this product and&lt;br /&gt;will order the daytime w/SPF version. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE LOVE this cream, and have been using it for years!</li>
    <li> Does moisturize my face well but it is overly scented. I am going back to the Body shop vitamin C lotion.</li>
    <li> I love all the products by Lumene. They are fantastic, and once you have tried them, you wouldn&#x27;t settle for anything less! I love this rich night cream.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Friend recommended this cream, and now my skin feels moist and smoother in the morning when I wake. Love it.</li>
    <li> Too greasy for me.  It left this slimy film on my face for the rest of the day making me look oily.  I kept having to rub my face with a tissue to get it off.</li>
    <li> I started using this on my face and after two weeks I was very impressed! My skin looked brighter and smoother. The product is somewhat thick, but absorbs in about an hour.  It has a nice citrusy scent.The age and acne scar spots are fading along with my \\&quot;laugh\\&quot; lines getting smoother.  I then used it on the back of my hands for the numerous age spots. Again, after two weeks the spots cleared significantly! I am now using it on my fore arms. They are starting to look less spotty, I would use this on my whole bodyI Their products are at least 80% natural. I have not used many products on my face due to break-outs; I got none from this product. The bottle lasted me for about six weeks. I will use this all the time now.</li>
