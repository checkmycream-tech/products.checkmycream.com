      <li>Works good</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say anything about this product that I bought but it is a good product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;- Good packaging&lt;</li>
      <li>They make great nose-pickers, but as any respectable audiologist or ENT doctor would tell you....do not stick these in your ear.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s on the mend, but that means even more itching!</li>

      <li>I will buy a couple more when I get the chance.</li>
      <li>After about 5 minutes with that, I was hearing better than I have in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I love it.</li>
      <li>I love that it is made of steel and is sturdy.</li>
      <li>must admit that my favorite ear wax removal tool of all time was the concave side of the cap of a Bic ball point pen</li>
      <li>If it didn&#x27;t hurt, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d love it.</li>
      <li>It is what I need. :)</li>
      <li>I also like the squared off handle for better handling.</li>
      <li>but I am doing better with this that I was with a bobby pin.</li>
      <li>Glad I decided to give one a try.</li>
      <li>I like the screw-like end better.</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ll find something more flexible.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t imagine an ear pick being better than this.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Feels better and softer</li>
      <li>Way better than Q-tips.  </li>
      <li>Both sides of the ear pick works :)</li>
      <li>After many years the pick deteriorated.  </li>
      <li>This tool helps satisfy the itch without causing a lot more damage.</li>
      <li>It was such a great purchase!!  </li>
      <li>must admit that my favorite ear wax removal tool of all time was the concave side of the cap of a Bic ball point pen</li>
      <li>My ears have never been so clean!</li>
      <li>It is nice, thick, has a good weight, and feels great in your hands.</li>
      <li>Many years ago my grandmother gifted me a plastic earpick as I have tremendous amounts of earwax.  </li>
      <li>The blunted end with ridges is a relatively unique design and worked better than the hook and eyelets used in the doctors office.  </li>
      <li>With this mini tool, I was able to get most of the wax out in the first try!</li>
      <li>This is very useful and way better than just using a cotton buds to clean your ears.</li>
      <li>and now it&#x27;s just fine.  </li>
      <li>It is easy clean.</li>
      <li>I have seen the light.</li>
      <li>Sturdy and has smooth edges.</li>
      <li>It works fantastically and is so easy to clean and sanitize.  </li>
      <li>Works great for the purpose intended if used properly.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean.</li>
      <li>I use this on a regular basis and am happy with it.</li>
      <li>Up until I found this, I was using a good old fashioned bobbi pin and still having to go the ENT Doctor to get  </li>
      <li>The ear pick is just the right length and has smooth sides that do not hurt when you use it!</li>
      <li>nice and polished and smooth, no sharp edges or burrs.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is a great tool but be careful how you use it.  </li>
      <li>I was somewhat hesitant to order this item since it was slightly different from the plastic one I knew and loved.  </li>
      <li>It arrived quickly, and on time.</li>
      <li>the edges are just the right amount of sharpness that it will clean your ear but not make you bleed.</li>
      <li>im giving 4 stars as the scoop portion would be better if it were smaller but overall, a great product.</li>
      <li>everything takes so long to arrived, but it was a good price</li>
      <li>It does take a while to get to you, but it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s actually made from good quality, thanks would buy this again.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great earpick especially if you like sticking metal objects near your brain.</li>
      <li>to be careful not to get it too deep into ears though :D</li>
      <li>Quality is nice, basically looks like a stainless steel utensil, and so far no issues with it flaking off or with rust.  </li>
      <li>No sharp edges and very comfortable on the inside of your ear.</li>
      <li>I use the other end for itches because the blunt end is good for getting those itches.</li>
      <li>I also feel safer in the sense that because there is no roughness you are more sensitive to knowing exactly where it is in the ear canal</li>
      <li>Cautionary note, as great as this is because of it size and ability to remove wax, be mindful of potential damage to your ear canal and/or drum if not used properly.</li>
      <li>Looks great but hard to use</li>
      <li>/&gt;The first to arrive was the Ototek Loop Ear Wax Removal tool.  </li>
      <li>It was the first of the three to arrive</li>
      <li>Personally I would&#x27;ve preferred a more curved shape</li>
      <li>The 10 metal silver tone ear pick tools were my second favorite.</li>
      <li>This is my first time using one of these.</li>
      <li>I thought metal would be better, bit it actually kinda hurts.</li>
      <li>Easy to clean and works as expected.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended, and worth the wait---</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought the 1 piece and the quality is AMAZING! It is nice, thick, has a good weight, and feels great in your hands. I can&#x27;t imagine an ear pick being better than this. I will buy a couple more when I get the chance.</li>
    <li> I ordered three different ear wax removal tools on 3/1/15 with the thought I could compare all three products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first to arrive was the Ototek Loop Ear Wax Removal tool.  It was the first of the three to arrive (it arrived on 3/4/15) and was also the most expensive.  (I paid $12.15 for it).  This consists of a plastic rod about 2 3/4 inches long overall.  The &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; end of the device is 2 inches, at which point there is a circular safe guard, with the working end being being a smaller diameter rod 3/4 inch long.  At the end of the smaller rod is a tiny  circular hoop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second to arrive was the Steel 2in1 Ear Pick Curette.  This was the second to arrive, shipping from Hong Kong, and costing $1.00.  It arrived around April 6.  It is a metal rod, 3 3/8 inches long.  At one end is a tiny &amp;#34;scoop&amp;#34;.  At the other end is a small metal knob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last to arrive was a set of 10 Metal Silver Tone Earpick Ear Curettes.  They also were shipped from Hong Kong (is there a thing in Asia about ear wax removal or are they just happy to have found another niche market to neat-obsessed westerners?) They cost $1.50 for the set of 10.  They are flat pieces of metal, 2 1/4 inches long, with a tiny &amp;#34;scoop&amp;#34; at one end and a wider flat metal section at the other that serves as a handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My preference of the three items is the Steel 2in1 Ear Pick curette.  It allowed me to reach in far enough to get deeply buried ear wax out, and seemed sturdy and well made.  The 10 metal silver tone ear pick tools were my second favorite. They were flimsier than my favorite item, and seemed to be somewhat more crudely made.  (I think I could have turned them out in a high school metal shop.)  The Orotek loop ear removal tool was my least favorite.  The circular guard kept me from inserting the cleaning end as far into my ear as I would like, and the &amp;#34;business end&amp;#34; of the tool was too flexible to allow me to apply enough force to scrape off wax adhering to the sides of the ear canal..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit that my favorite ear wax removal tool of all time was the concave side of the cap of a Bic ball point pen (I can just hear the ghost of my Mother yelling about not putting anything into your ear), but not having one of those caps handy, the Steel 2in! curette was the best of these three items.to scrape off wax adhering to the sides of the ear canal..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit that my favorite ear wax removal tool of all time was the concave side of the cap of a Bic ball point pen (I can just hear the ghost of my Mother yelling about not putting anything into your ear), but not having one of those caps handy, the Steel 2in! curette was the best of these three items.</li>
    <li> Doctor said don&#x27;t put Ear buds in your ear, so I said Yolo and upgraded to metal.</li>
    <li> Very good quality instrument. The scoop end is difficult to keep in position for digging out the potatoes growing in my ears, but all-in-all, very high quality. Fits in my pocket quite nicely too.</li>
    <li> This is the one to buy.  Good size for probably everyone.  Most are too small - this one professional size.</li>
    <li> The ear pick is just the right length and has smooth sides that do not hurt when you use it!</li>
    <li> Initially, I hated this thing. But I found it the other day, picked it up, gave it a second chance and now I love it. I am from a culture where cleaning ears is a hygiene practice so I have much experience in the scoop style of cleaning ears. I always look for a thin, small scoops as they are the most effective. This product does not have that thin scoop I usually look for. The scoop is rather thick and ineffective. However, it doesn&#x27;t matter...I have seen the light. The honeycomb end of the earpick is amazing. It is like a q-tip but it so a million times better. My ears have never been so clean! It gets out EVERYTHING! I use the other end for itches because the blunt end is good for getting those itches.</li>
    <li> No idea what the knurled end is for.&lt;br /&gt;The spoon end is about 3.5mm wide at its widest point (5/32in), which is a tiny bit wider than I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;The whole is 9.0cm long, or 3.5ins.&lt;br /&gt;All nice and polished and smooth, no sharp edges or burrs.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be machined out of a single piece of steel, making for easy cleaning and no cracks for dirt to get stuck in.&lt;br /&gt;The middle handle has a square cross-section, which makes for easy control of rotation.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good ear pick which does the job.</li>
    <li> YES I USE IT ON MY WIFE WHO IS A TOTAL BED PATIENT</li>
    <li> Cautionary note, as great as this is because of it size and ability to remove wax, be mindful of potential damage to your ear canal and/or drum if not used properly. A review of the actual product itself, the one I received had a sharp burr that needed to be sanded down. Inspect the one you receive before using it.</li>
    <li> The spoon may be OK, but the opposite end is not aggressive enough.  I think I&#x27;ll find something more flexible.</li>
    <li> They make great nose-pickers, but as any respectable audiologist or ENT doctor would tell you....do not stick these in your ear.</li>
    <li> very sturdy ear pick ,  but be VERY VERY careful. I much rather use cotton swabs than this. Feels better and softer</li>
    <li> I have atrociously dry skin on my ear canals. I&#x27;m constantly itching at them. I&#x27;ve even scratched to the point of bleeding wounds and resulting scabbing. It&#x27;s on the mend, but that means even more itching! My finger nails are too sharp and end up causing more damage. This tool helps satisfy the itch without causing a lot more damage.</li>
    <li> I love this product as if used properly it gets out the wax unlike a qtip which push the wax back to the ear drum. Be careful not to stick it all the way in.</li>
    <li> The actual earpick is likely quite smaller than shown on the webpage. It is only about 9cm (3.6in) in length.&lt;br /&gt;It feels very solid and quite comfortable to hold and use. No sharp edges so unlikely to hurt inside the ear canals.&lt;br /&gt;Need to be careful not to get it too deep into ears though :D</li>
    <li> Exactly what was described I would have liked a little bit bigger scoop on the one end but it works and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Too small, n didn&#x27;t feel comfortable using it</li>
    <li> Alot smaller than I expected. The pick isn&#x27;t sharp enough to clean.</li>
    <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;- Good packaging&lt;br /&gt;- Clean&lt;br /&gt;- As pictured&lt;br /&gt;- Moderately effective in its purpose&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Personally I would&#x27;ve preferred a more curved shape</li>
    <li> At first, I joked that they would put the item in a little rowboat and manually ship it across the Pacific like that.  I found this is probably a decent description.  For anyone wondering, the product ships from China, hence the month long delivery time.  But the product is a well crafted piece of metal that is a bit longer than an average Q-tip.  It fits well in your hand, just don&#x27;t go too deep.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations.  I&#x27;ve gone through multiple cheaper ear pick curettes, and this beats them all.  The curette also came with a little clear pouch for storage.  There is also an option hole on the pouch to put through a key chain.  This was so great that I purchased another for my mother who also provided great reviews.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo171UMFVPSWLYL]]This video may not play on some devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s difficult to tell this product by picture so I made this very short video. Hopefully you find it helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this pick through the only seller located in the USA. It arrived the same week. All others are in Hong Kong, which is cheaper but you&#x27;ll be waiting over a month to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: If you value your hearing do not use this ear pick on yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> im giving 4 stars as the scoop portion would be better if it were smaller but overall, a great product.</li>
    <li> I like the screw-like end better. The spoon end is useless because of the blunt edges. I also like the squared off handle for better handling.</li>
    <li> Value for money,strongly built,lifelong solution if you don&#x27;t lost it.Only bad thing is that you have to wait almost 1 month because it comes direct from China to your place.</li>
    <li> Sturdy stainless steel construction. It gets the job done. Happy about the purchase. It arrived quickly, and on time.</li>
    <li> Many years ago my grandmother gifted me a plastic earpick as I have tremendous amounts of earwax.  After many years the pick deteriorated.  I looked in many chain stores for an earpick, for a long time with no luck.  I was somewhat hesitant to order this item since it was slightly different from the plastic one I knew and loved.  It was such a great purchase!!  It works fantastically and is so easy to clean and sanitize.  This earpick is sure to last a long time as it is made out of steel - I do not see myself needing to replace it anytime soon.  The price was great and I am always pleased with how quickly Amazon items arrive.</li>
    <li> It works very good, gets out the wax and fits with in the ear well. Both sides of the ear pick works :)</li>
    <li> This is a great product. High quality metal the edges are just the right amount of sharpness that it will clean your ear but not make you bleed. It took about 3-4 weeks to ship because they put it on a boat and row it over from china but it&#x27;s worth it. I bought 3 at once and don&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> I never thought of myself as an earpick fanboy, but this thing will win you over.  It&#x27;s heavy, solid, and very well polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine arrived slightly bent from shipping, but I straightened it up and now it&#x27;s just fine.  Highly recommended, and worth the wait---but order more than one, you&#x27;ll want to keep them handy.</li>
    <li> It is sooo tiny, but it works the same. I prefer it longer and the handle can be thicker. Other than that, it works perfectly, smoothly.</li>
    <li> Even though this product is thick and durable, I find it too thick then the other much less expensive ear pics. It doesn&#x27;t scrape as well since the scrape is thick. The ear is small as it is, so in my opinion, a thinner one would work better. As inexpensive as ear picks are, you don&#x27;t really need a too think of an ear pick so that you will not break it. Even for the thinner, less expensive kinds, you won&#x27;t be jabbing into your ear enough to break the thinner ones. I&#x27;ve only used it once after I had purchased it. I had lost my other thinner, cheaper type. So I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It is much bigger, and bulkier to travel with when you have many other things to put inside your travel bag. I guess one positive to it is that it is easier to find it you ever misplace it because it is much thicker and longer than other ear picks around.</li>
    <li> Looks great but hard to use</li>
    <li> So my review is for the &amp;#34;1 pc&amp;#34; - &amp;#34;Steel 2 in 1 Ear Pick...&amp;#34; with one curved end and the other blunted.  This thing is pretty awesome.  I have had a lot of trouble the last few years of getting hardened wax build up to the point where I lose hearing in one of my ears despite never having had used Q-tips or anything that would have impacted wax onto my eardrum.  After the 3rd time I had to go get my ear flushed by a nurse at the doctor&#x27;s office, I began looking for DIY solution.  I tried flushing my ears myself but even that never got everything off.  Started looking for ear picks and landed on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Observations:&lt;br /&gt;1.  This has a solid design and you can be certain it will never break/bend - unlike some of the other thin metal or plastic ones that are basically disposables.  Seems to be made out of really solid stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Very tiny! About 4 inches long and very thin.  This might even fit inside a wallet it is so small.  Only a little longer than a credit card.&lt;br /&gt;3.  No sharp edges.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Comes with a small flexible plastic carrying sleeve.&lt;br /&gt;5.  The blunted end with ridges is a relatively unique design and worked better than the hook and eyelets used in the doctors office.  After about 5 minutes with that, I was hearing better than I have in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Use at your own risk.  Docs tell you not to put anything in your ear like this.  For people who have problems like I described above, you get to a point where you realize there is no other option.  Flushing doesn&#x27;t get everything.  The wax drops are useless and often times make things worse.  This was the only way I could find to avoid having to stop in at an urgent care every 3 months just to regain my hearing from wax buildup.&lt;br /&gt;2.  They recently noted this in the description but realize this ships out of Hong Kong and thus didn&#x27;t have any tracking and also took a solid two-three weeks to get here.</li>
    <li> I have an ear wax fetish and this does the job. I love that it is made of steel and is sturdy. My other ear pick was wooden and finally broke, but not this one.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find one like this for months and my sister in law told me that she got hers from Amazon. This is very useful and way better than just using a cotton buds to clean your ears.</li>
    <li> It is what I need. :)</li>
    <li> Works great for getting the hard to reach/get ear wax! Four stars because of the length. I wish it&#x27;s longer</li>
    <li> I was hoping for something not so heavy.  Tried it once and touched my ear to deep and it hurt.  Maybe I am not using it correctly.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using one of these. I have a chronic ear build up that blocks off my hearing for weeks at a time and over the years I was one of those bobby pin users with varied results. I never knew anything like this existed until a random Amazon search one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first use I was impressed. No sharp edges and very comfortable on the inside of your ear. It has not solved my problem persay but I am doing better with this that I was with a bobby pin. I also feel safer in the sense that because there is no roughness you are more sensitive to knowing exactly where it is in the ear canal so I do not worry as much as I use to doing this task. Glad I decided to give one a try.</li>
    <li> Works good but I lost it cause it so small</li>
    <li> Excellent tool to get out ear wax. Highly recommend for those of you tired of Q-tips.</li>
    <li> I think coming from Asian everything takes so long to arrived, but it was a good price and it&#x27;s actually made from good quality, thanks would buy this again. But make sure you know that it wont arrive fast lol!</li>
    <li> Up until I found this, I was using a good old fashioned bobbi pin and still having to go the ENT Doctor to get  my ears cleaned out every 6 months. With this mini tool, I was able to get most of the wax out in the first try!</li>
    <li> This ear pick has solid design so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the tool falling off the handle like other ear picks. It cleans more thoroughly than every other ear pick I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re one of those people who gets earwax buildup and the last time you gave yourself loss of hearing and a painful ear using Q-tips, this is for you. It&#x27;s polished stainless steel and the little spoon at the end is gentle on your ear. I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it. It really helps. I haven&#x27;t had a buildup problem since I starting using it. It does take a while to get to you, but it&#x27;s worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Works well and arrived nicely.</li>
    <li> Way better than Q-tips.  Quality is nice, basically looks like a stainless steel utensil, and so far no issues with it flaking off or with rust.  Easy to clean and works as expected.</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be amazing. A friend of mine swore by hers, but she had one with a flexible end. I thought metal would be better, bit it actually kinda hurts. You have to scrape so softly, honestly a cotton swab works better. Big disappointment, BUT decent looking tool. If it didn&#x27;t hurt, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d love it.</li>
    <li> Does  it with comfort. Easy to clean. Will not scratch your ear. It could be a little bigger, but that&#x27;s just my preference. I use this on a regular basis and am happy with it. Previous ear cleaners made of plastic broke. This is stainless steel.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I expected.  It&#x27;s sturdy vs some of the other ones I saw on Amazon.  Like with everyone else, it took a long time to get here (almost a month).  Not giving them a 4 star based on the shipping.  That&#x27;s for not having some sort of case for it.  But, I guess for the price it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
    <li> Product arrived earlier than expected. I love it I got it as a gift for my husband who complains of his ears being stopped up. He loves it</li>
    <li> I must say i was surprised how small this really is, but how great this works for me.  I recommend this over any plastic device that has the same function as i have both now, and this one is much nicer to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping, took 3-4 weeks to get...</li>
    <li> It was delivered and packed just as described.</li>
    <li> This product is made out of metal.  It is small enough that it will fit in a child&#x27;s ear. The body or the handle of this tool fits really well between your fingers. It is easy clean. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it took too long to arrive after I placed the order.</li>
    <li> Item was as advertised and received in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one for hyperbole, but I would have paid 3 times the price for this tool. If you deal with excessive wax build-up &amp; are tired of Debrox &amp; irrigation, give this guy a try. Won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these ear picks.the only reasons i&#x27;m giving 4 stars is the time it took to receive them(3 weeks)</li>
    <li> My husband thinks the handle is a little wide, but I think it&#x27;s ok. Although I wished the scoop part was a little deeper and less flat like my wonderful last earpick that I lost. But it is wonderfully made</li>
    <li> I really like the weight and quality of this pick, but I&#x27;m slightly annoyed that the sides are not cupped.  This makes the task of cleaning ones ears a little more dangerous, as the material is not adequately collected by the instrument.</li>
    <li> These are great. A little smaller than I&#x27;m used to, and shipping was a little slow... but both I knew about before hand from other reviews. I was surprised at how soft the scoop was and the quality. It&#x27;s great earpick especially if you like sticking metal objects near your brain.</li>
    <li> Item as described delivered.</li>
    <li> grabs everything cleanly, ships for a long time</li>
    <li> Works great for the purpose intended if used properly.</li>
    <li> Great Product so far so good</li>
    <li> Works okay, but need to be careful using it. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, as I feel uncomfortable using it. Seems like one slip and you may have a serious problem.</li>
    <li> It is a great tool but be careful how you use it.  It wouldn&#x27;t take much to damage your ear.  I have lots of wax so I love it.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and has smooth edges. Works well.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for a friend and he loves it. Beats the screw driver he was using.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say anything about this product that I bought but it is a good product.  It is made up of good tough material.</li>
