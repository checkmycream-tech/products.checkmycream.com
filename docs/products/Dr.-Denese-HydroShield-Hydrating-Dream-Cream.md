<li> It really works and helps make me look at least 10 years younger!</li>
<li> I have been using it at night and while is does an adequate job it is quite thin and runny.  </li>

<li> I use it every day along with other Dr. Denese products.</li>
<li> a little dry on skin.</li>
<li> ; average.  </li>
<li> i like the consistency, slight fragrance of this nighttime moisturizers which can be used in the day as well.  </li>
<li> Makes my skin feel hydrated all day without being heavy.</li>
<li> This cream made my face break out so bad the first two days, I was in shock.</li>
<li> very tight with my money</li>
<li> /&gt;You need to use very little.  </li>
<li> So as a solo product, not sure.</li>
<li> and it was too late.</li>
<li> ---I recommend it to everyone---you can&#x27;t go wrong with this ----</li>
<li> My skin was in terrible shape &amp; had tried all the Oil of Olay products to no avail.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> One of my wife&#x27;s favorite items to buy from Amazon on a regular basis!</li>
    <li> I tried this product for 2 months plus and didn&#x27;t see any improvement at all.&lt;br /&gt;I went to see if I could return it and it was too late.</li>
    <li> This Dream Cream is perfect for those of us who find Dr Denese Hydroshield Face Serum too oily.  Purchased from the Dr Denese Website when it was on sale.  I really like that it&#x27;s light weight, but does provide lots of moisture.  Dream Cream at night followed by Dr Denese Firming Facial Age Corrector Cream works great for me as my skin is not terribly dry.  Next purchase will be through Amazon due to better pricing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three years, and it&#x27;s wonderful.  I would definitely recommend, along with the moisture serum.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s worth every cent.&lt;br /&gt;You need to use very little.  My face has never felt so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years now and can see lines in my cheeks diminished.</li>
    <li> a little dry on skin.</li>
    <li> Product really hydrates your skin....gives your skin a fresh and dewy appearance.  All Dr dense products I have tried are excellent and i  have tried many other brands.</li>
    <li> Not the best hydrating cream that I have used - rate it a &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; average.  I do like the light feel of this cream and will finish the jar but probably will not repurchase this one.  I do like the Dr. D retinol pads.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4 years or more. This last batch did not have the same fresh smell that I loved.</li>
    <li> The only Face Cream I will ever use. Makes my skin feel hydrated all day without being heavy. Love this DREAM CREAM!</li>
    <li> This is an OK moisturizer.  I have been using it at night and while is does an adequate job it is quite thin and runny.  I am also using the Hydrosheild Face Serum and that may boost the moisture I am getting from this cream.  My skin tends to get dry during the colder months and I need a nighttime moisturizer that will help fend off the dry patches I sometimes get.  I normally use Remede, which I love, during the colder months.  If you need only light moisture this product may work for you.  But if you are looking for moderate or heavy duty moisture this product is probably not for you.</li>
    <li> Have used Dr. Denese products for several years now, and this does keep my mature, dry skin hydrated.  It does minimize wrinkles as well.</li>
    <li> I choose this rating as it really does hydrate your skin.  I have drier skin that is easily irritated and I really love this cream, add that together with the hydrating serum and hydroshield eye emulsion, you will love your skin.  If your skin needs some moisture to plump it up, this is definately for you!</li>
    <li> cannot say enough about this dream cream, It is very hydrating and smoothes out the wrinkles. I have tried several of her products and they do not disappoint.</li>
    <li> Terrific cream--love it--and in this winter weather--it is the best....&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin, and have tried many creams and keep coming back to this one---I recommend it to everyone---you can&#x27;t go wrong with this ----</li>
    <li> Since I starded using this cream, my face does not feel dry  as it use to be, even in the winter time</li>
    <li> I love this Dream Cream, it  absorbs nicely &amp; Ive seen improvements in my skin. I would highly recommend this to any one!</li>
    <li> This cream made my face break out so bad the first two days, I was in shock. So upset I spent the money on this and to top it off you cannot return it. I will never buy a prouduct again without a sample first. Good thing about info-commercials you can return and get money back, now I have a whole tub of this stuff and out $50.  I asked the seller if I could return it, and they said no. NEVER AGAIN.</li>
    <li> This cream goes on so smoothly &amp; effortlessly.  It is so moisturizing, I just love it.  Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Love this cream.  It&#x27;s silky and absorbs wonderfully.</li>
    <li> FOR ME, THIS IS THE GREAT CREAM EVER INVENTED. IT IS GREAT FOR DAY AND  NIGHT...IT HYDRATES YOU SKIN, IT IS NOT HEAVY BUT DOES EVERYTHING I WOULD ASK FOR. THIS IS THE GREATEST EVERYDAY, EVERY NIGHT, EVERY EVERYTHING CREAM I HAVE EVER FOUND AND BELIEVE ME, I HAVE TRIED THEM ALL!!!  I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE ANY AGE.  YOU WILL LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> This stuff is like magic! I actually use several of her products - I got them in a set of 4 travel sized items and now I&#x27;m hooked. I use the Pro C Illuminating Pads, then the Hydroshield Serum, then once dry, the Dream Cream. I get lots of complements on my skin.</li>
    <li> Outstanding replenishing creme! I started with a $1,000 worth of product I bought for $250 on a PBS subscription drive. My skin was in terrible shape &amp; had tried all the Oil of Olay products to no avail.  My skin looks beautiful now.</li>
    <li> This product help me a lot.</li>
    <li> This cream does just what it says and is light but moisturizes well. The skin feels so smooth &amp; soft.</li>
    <li> The product is creamy and feels wonderful on my face. My skin is not as dry as with other products I have used.</li>
    <li> I think this works very well, but I do use this with the serum and the resurface wash... So as a solo product, not sure. I do like that my face absorbs it well and does not leave a greasy look to my face, also very happy with the amount you receive. I am def. very tight with my money and I feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream for your face. If your face is dry this cream will allow your skin to be soft and smooth again. Thank u Dr. Denese  your products are excellent.</li>
    <li> This is something I discovered on a shopping channel, and I found it cheaper here. I love the feel of it as well as the smell (dream cream smells a little like a Dreamsicle but not obnoxious and fake). I miss it when I&#x27;m out, so I keep this on my wish list.</li>
    <li> Good value for the money and the cream seems to be working well on my drying skin&lt;br /&gt;would order again</li>

This is not a heavy face cream yet aids in diminishing fine lines and wrinkles.  I am allergic to so many face creams and this has not caused a reaction.  Amazon has the best price.</li>
    <li> This face cream feels wonderful to apply and is moisturizing. I am a fan of Dr. Denese and try not to go without her dream cream and her HydroShield serum. The price is reasonable for the amount.</li>
    <li> Great cream.  Dr. Denese&#x27;s products are always good. Seller did not package well and product lid was loose and slopped around.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that - no complaints.</li>
    <li> Great cream, excellent buy!</li>
    <li> All products are excellent</li>
    <li> i like the consistency, slight fragrance of this nighttime moisturizers which can be used in the day as well.  makes my face feel moist and fresh after applying.</li>
