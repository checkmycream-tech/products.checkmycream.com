      <li>So these are great, buy if you want dazzling white teeth :D</li>
      <li>5 Star for sure !</li>
      <li>Wish I had read more reviews before purchasing.</li>
      <li>:) ) I spaced out applications</li>
      <li>Works great but does hurt my teeth if I use it too much</li>
      <li>These are amazing, they keep my teeth dazzling white like a celebrity!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, all good</li>
      <li>Crest Whitestrips, as a product, work fine.  </li>
      <li>We will definitely pick this item up again when the coffee stains creep back :) thank you!!!</li>
      <li>They are easy to apply just make sure your teeth are dry before applying.</li>
      <li>Liked the classic white strips.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used them for time specified but did not notice much of a difference.</li>
      <li>Fast working.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are obviously expired, and packaging is not the original box, but who cares.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m weird and can&#x27;t whiten the bottom row of my teeth because they are wayyyy too sensitive so that leaves even more strips for the top row!</li>
      <li>These are great, my teeth were a little sensitive to the product (but only that&#x27;s because I have pretty sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>However, the re-packaging and re-naming by this particular seller is a deliberate attempt to mislead and monetize.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend these.  </li>
      <li>and I noticed sensitivity which proves they have strength left.</li>
      <li>Given the application difficulty I can only use these on the upper teeth (and I have normal-sized teeth...not large, not small), so I may end up with whiter teeth on the top if I finish the supply I have left.</li>
      <li>Old or something.</li>
      <li>(Except the bottom teeth, they get sensitive after like 5 mins of whitening)</li>
      <li>Another way to conserve on these is to cut them in half horizontally, and apply to the bottom half of your top teeth.</li>
      <li>I am guessing these are early version white strips being resold???</li>
      <li>I have used drugstore brand Crest white strips for years and these are a flimsy version, they don&#x27;t stick on my teeth that remind me of Crest&#x27;s early attempts at this product.</li>
      <li>As for the whitening ability, my teeth were already pretty white from Crest&#x27;s other type of whitestrips</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the only part you usually see when you smile</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Works great but does hurt my teeth if I use it too much</li>
    <li> These strips are very hard to work with. They are very sheer and slide around a lot when you&#x27;re trying to get them to adhere. The bottom strips are useless - very small, not nearly enough foldover, and won&#x27;t stay in place. As for the whitening ability, my teeth were already pretty white from Crest&#x27;s other type of whitestrips and I wanted to try these to see if I could get maximum white, whivh I know can be different for everyone. Given the application difficulty I can only use these on the upper teeth (and I have normal-sized teeth...not large, not small), so I may end up with whiter teeth on the top if I finish the supply I have left. This variety of Crest Whitestrips is not worth the money and wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used drugstore brand Crest white strips for years and these are a flimsy version, they don&#x27;t stick on my teeth that remind me of Crest&#x27;s early attempts at this product. Further, they come packaged in a plain plastic baggie not in the box as pictured. I am guessing these are early version white strips being resold??? Wish I had read more reviews before purchasing.</li>
    <li> Old or something. Not what I expected</li>
    <li> I thought this was a bit spendy. Says 28 strips but only 14 packs, so it&#x27;s over a dollar a treatment. Liked the classic white strips.</li>
    <li> Works great, noticeable results.</li>
    <li> These are great, my teeth were a little sensitive to the product (but only that&#x27;s because I have pretty sensitive teeth :) ) I spaced out applications so it took a bit longer but my teeth are a lot whiter than they were before. We will definitely pick this item up again when the coffee stains creep back :) thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used them for time specified but did not notice much of a difference. They are easy to apply just make sure your teeth are dry before applying.</li>
    <li> Initially, I wrote a bad review. However, after using them, they do work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are obviously expired, and packaging is not the original box, but who cares. They work. Teeth are whiter and I noticed sensitivity which proves they have strength left.</li>
    <li> as always ,,,good product,service and price..</li>
    <li> Several people noticed how white my teeth got.  I would highly recommend these.  Cost effective!</li>
    <li> Works great!  As promised.  As expected</li>
    <li> These are amazing, they keep my teeth dazzling white like a celebrity! I get compliments all the time on my teeth, I keep a pack of these in my house at ALL times. I&#x27;m weird and can&#x27;t whiten the bottom row of my teeth because they are wayyyy too sensitive so that leaves even more strips for the top row! Another way to conserve on these is to cut them in half horizontally, and apply to the bottom half of your top teeth. That&#x27;s the only part you usually see when you smile so I do that when I&#x27;m running low. Be careful of white spots though otherwise it can look a bit weird if half of your teeth are yellow and the other half are white. I keep these on for maybe 2 weeks doing about 30-60 minutes a day. I do that every 2 months and they stay white with no sensitivity and I have been doing that for almost 3 years. (Except the bottom teeth, they get sensitive after like 5 mins of whitening) So these are great, buy if you want dazzling white teeth :D</li>
    <li> Excellent product. ! Works very good . 5 Star for sure !</li>
    <li> Great results. Fast working.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay $70+ at the dentist office for the entire box. I have purchased this a couple of times.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, all good</li>
    <li> Crest Whitestrips, as a product, work fine.  However, the re-packaging and re-naming by this particular seller is a deliberate attempt to mislead and monetize.  (Note:  I have not purchased from this seller.  But I counted the pouches in the picture, read the description, and read the reviews.)  Let me save you some time:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• 28 strips &#x3D; 14 pouches.  So annoying that people phrase this way, as if you plan to bleach only half of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;• Other people have commented that these are expired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems this is a blatant attempt to squeeze money out of you.  Buy the box.</li>
    <li> always a great item seen results in 2 days</li>
    <li> Causes tooth sensitivity</li>
