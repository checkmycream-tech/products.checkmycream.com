    <li> FINE PROMPT SERVICE AS EXPECTED! THX</li>
    <li> Purchased to give away in the church back to school bags, great item.</li>
    <li> Carry in my purse all the time.</li>
    <li> expires in a couple of months. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> perfect for give aways</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Does what it says it should. Will be using it for my upcoming wedding (we&#x27;re having BBQ) and it should work well.</li>
    <li> Bought these to stick in the car and the backpack for trips to the parks. Beats having to carry a bottle or trying to buy them individually!</li>
    <li> These things suck a waste of money.Wasn&#x27;t at all what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great product and quick shipment!!</li>
    <li> Horrible product.  Most of the wipes were dry and the ones that weren&#x27;t were like rough and not soothing. Just like the ones at bad BBQ restaurants!</li>
    <li> I keep a handful of these in the car and at work. Keeps everyone&#x27;s hands, children and adults alike clean and germ free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wipes are paper-like and soaked in the germicidal fluid. Strong alcohol smell. leaves no noticeable residue. Wet and big enough for one adult or two small children to clean up.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.  Contrary to many other reviews, I found no problem with either the material, or any after feelings on my hands.  These are for your hands and small areas, if you want to clean larger surfaces get something else.

    <li> CAN INSURE THAT ONE STAYS GERM FREE AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THEY ARE SO HANDY!</li>
    <li> I bought these bc I can carry them anywhere and use to disinfect my hands as well as surfaces.  I was using the liquid sanitizer but they r too expensive and I would need to constantly refill my portable bottle.</li>

    <li> Just what I needed! Good for travel and unlike liquid, doesn&#x27;t spill!</li>
    <li> These wipes are super stiff and soggy,  not what I was expecting.  I was trying to purchase individually wrapped wipes like the Up &amp; Up wipes that Target discontinued.</li>
    <li> This product will part of the students&#x27; first aide kit that they will create in class. Thank you.</li>
    <li> fast shipment and reasonable price for reasonable quality</li>
