      <li>i have an original bottle and it is not the same mix.</li>
      <li>but this is the original sea breeze and not watered down.</li>
      <li>Extra large bottle of clear astrigent.  </li>
      <li>Used Sea Breeze when I was a teenager and am nearly 80 now.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for the original formula sea breeze of years past . . .</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t know what others expected</li>
      <li>Do the treatment/rinse once a week and use pH shampoo instead of regular shampoo until you are back to normal.  </li>
      <li>and I live in an old moldy building, my hair was attracting mold and would begin to smell weird like old bread after like one or two workouts or a really sweaty walk to work.</li>

<li> I agree with some other posts.  </li>
<li> My oiliness was due to hormone imbalance after stopping birth control.</li>
<li> I use it daily and also when I travel (in a very small bottle) to feel less &amp;#34;grimy&amp;#34; after being in an airplane or on a train...</li>
<li> I am black, so I can&#x27;t wash my hair every day without drying it out.</li>
<li> All my hair smelled like after was the conditioner and a little tea tree oil.</li>
<li> The lady at sallys suggested I do a scalp treatment with this for a few min then rinse with distilled water.</li>
<li> I went from shampooing every three days to shampooing everyday!</li>
<li> I have used it for at least a month.</li>
<li> not a happy camper.</li>
<li> NOT REAL SEA BREEZE!!!!!!!</li>
<li> I hope this helps other people because I know how devastating it can be to your self esteem.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have loved this product for 30 years. Tried and true and has so many uses</li>
    <li> I use this all the time, after work out, under the sun in summer days. So refreshing and cool you down, like a sea breeze, really!</li>
    <li> I have always been a big fan of Seabreeze. I have used for my scalp as well as an astringent for my skin. I love the large size.</li>
    <li> This product is good for cleaning your skin of dirt. I have used it for at least a month.</li>
    <li> I had been suffering with very oily scalp that also emitted a very foul smell no matter how many times I washed my hair this smell just stuck around. I went from shampooing every three days to shampooing everyday! My hair is very dry now thanks to the hard shampoos I used prior to finding this solution. My oiliness was due to hormone imbalance after stopping birth control. The lady at sallys suggested I do a scalp treatment with this for a few min then rinse with distilled water. My issue was corrected almost immediately. She also suggested to shampoo with a pH balancing shampoo. Do the treatment/rinse once a week and use pH shampoo instead of regular shampoo until you are back to normal.  I hope this helps other people because I know how devastating it can be to your self esteem. The shampoo I used was megasilk neutralizing shampoo by silk elements.</li>
    <li> Product was authentic.</li>
    <li> Extra large bottle of clear astrigent.  Just what I wanted but the large bottle is clunky and takes effort to pour.</li>
    <li> Super product.  Have used Sea Breeze for years.&lt;br /&gt;Astringent, deodorant, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Could not do without it in our medicine cabinet!</li>
    <li> exactly what is says works just like sea breeze does</li>
    <li> Just like the Sea Breeze I remember!  Very refreshing.</li>
    <li> Excellent astringent.  Great fragrance and totally refreshing.</li>
    <li> Refreshing and effective.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing like it. Nothing removes dirt like sea breeze and I can use it several times a day. This is what I used as a teen and am happy that I can still use it as an adult.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product. It works well. I love the tingling feeling on my face in the morning. It help wake me up.</li>
    <li> Best product for cleaning skin and feeling refreshed. I use it daily and also when I travel (in a very small bottle) to feel less &amp;#34;grimy&amp;#34; after being in an airplane or on a train...</li>
    <li> Because DC is so humid and I live in an old moldy building, my hair was attracting mold and would begin to smell weird like old bread after like one or two workouts or a really sweaty walk to work. I am black, so I can&#x27;t wash my hair every day without drying it out. And even after I shampooed my hair, the smell and mold, I guess, would linger and come back as soon as I sweat. My hairdresser recommended that I blend sea breeze with tea tree oil and jojoba oil before I shampoo my hair and then during the second shampoo. It worked wonders. It completely washed the moldy smell away and killed the mold. All my hair smelled like after was the conditioner and a little tea tree oil. The tea tree oil smell faded after about a day and then my hair smelled like nothing.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Many uses.  Convenient size.</li>
    <li> I agree with some other posts.  If you are looking for the original formula sea breeze of years past . . . THIS IS NOT IT.  This product looks similar, but it does not smell or feel the same.  Neither does it leave the same feeling on the skin.  Not as refreshing and leaves a residue.  So, if like me, you want the real deal . . . .I&#x27;m sorry to say that it is becoming harder and harder to find.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this particular product.</li>
    <li> MY NWIFE SAY&#x27;S ITS GREAT AND FEELS COOL .</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for what I bought it for but great deal and used it anyway.  Tried it for itchy scalp because it was recommended but it didn&#x27;t stop the itch.</li>
    <li> I love this product, glad I can get a big one now.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted!  Super fast!</li>
    <li> will buy again thank you</li>
    <li> I was expecting more of the Seabreeze original formula. My husband uses it for his skin and his hair. He likes it!!</li>
    <li> I got the original. . . I really don&#x27;t know what others expected but this is the original sea breeze and not watered down.</li>
    <li> I got tires of trying to find the regular/original sea breeze at local Drugstores.  It is a great product and I have used it for 30 years.</li>
    <li> Does what its supposed to do. ﾂ</li>
    <li> You get your money&#x27;s worth with this. Sea Breeze quality in a 32 oz. size you definitely save money buying this much compared to several small bottles at your local drug store. Great Sea Breeze smell also.  Two thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> I have chemo rash; seabreeze gives some relief...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Sea Breeze since I was a youth.  Over the last couple of years, I started breaking out more and couldn&#x27;t figure out why.  Upon performing Internet research, I learned that the Sea Breeze formula has been changed.  Subsequent to learning about this change, I immediately ordered this product.  I was stunned when I saw the difference.  This, combined with a different cleanser almost immediately cleared my skin.  I&#x27;m once again loyal to Sea Breeze, providing it&#x27;s the original formula.</li>
    <li> NOT REAL SEA BREEZE!!!!!!! No peppermint extract...sticky feeing. BOOOOO!!</li>
    <li> Cleans my face better than soap</li>
    <li> Great quality and service. Received it in timely manor. Will buy again from this vendor. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> not the original formula. it even smells different. not a happy camper. order of ingredients is different as well as additional unknown ingredients. i have an original bottle and it is not the same mix.</li>
    <li> Used Sea Breeze when I was a teenager and am nearly 80 now.  Still love it.  My nephew also remembers my sister using it on him after she washed his hair.  Not much in creme rinses back then, maybe lemon juice or Tame, and that was it.  Price went up a little, but other than that it&#x27;s about the same.</li>
    <li> Great product, great value size.</li>
    <li> I  love this product.  I was introduced to this at my hair salon years ago, when perms were all the rage. I am so happy  to find it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne Toole</li>
    <li> Good price.  Not the same formula as the old one used years ago but still effective.</li>
