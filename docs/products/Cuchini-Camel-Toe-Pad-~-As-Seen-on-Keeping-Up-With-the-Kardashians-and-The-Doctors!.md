### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>However, I am very happy I purchased it!</li>
      <li>I wish I could find more trustworthy reviews!!!!</li>
      <li>\\&quot;This Camel Toe Pad is the greatest invention of all time,\\&quot; he moaned.</li>
      <li>Some of my friends used to call me CHIME as my beef curtains blow in the wind- not any more!!</li>
      <li>, I know you said I wasn&#x27;t a good fit for your survey, but I have to tell you that this Toe Pad is the greatest invention of all time.</li>
      <li>Works great until u run out of the tape wish it came with more than 2 pieces of tape, once the tape ran out it was not useable.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied.</li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>She really liked it and it appeared to do the trick.  </li>
      <li>Once I used my own fashion tape all went well.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s better to be able to see the cuchini outline rather than a camel toe!</li>
      <li>It has kept me amused all morning with its easily installed humor!</li>
      <li>I feel comfortable in my leggings now and am very pleased.</li>
      <li>Its ok</li>
      <li>I use for a form fitting pair of jeans to avoid any embarrassment.</li>
      <li>She is able to wear her clothes with confidence now.  </li>
      <li>Maybe this product would be better for yoga pants</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to wear &amp; serves it purpose!</li>
      <li>I use them, but depending on the pants, it works ok sometimes.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I bought these with the intention of being able to start wearing yoga&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>The Cuchini ideally should be reversible; the obverse side featuring tell-tale ridges that simulate the delectable camel toe issue that entered into the fashion vernacular with the appearance of pedal-pushers and capris and the bikini back in the 1950s; the decade that has had a formative influence on the cinema aesthetic of one, John Waters.  </li>
      <li>These let you show off the right kind of curves.</li>
      <li>Give customers true reviews!</li>
      <li>; (or something along those lines) like the Cuchini Camel Toe Pad, it&#x27;s probably not seen the light of day.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product but if you are in a pinch you can use a banana peel.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t care, but it sure makes gardening a whole lot more</li>
      <li>To his credit, he continued to profess his undying love for the Toe Pad throughout the entirety of his protracted removal from store premises by a surprisingly large number of security personnel.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Later I spoke with Tammy-Jo, whose antediluvian stonewashed jeans precluded her from walking a straight line for more than three feet in any one direction.</li>
      <li>Thanks to $130,000 in plastic surgery and my Cuchini Camel Toe Pad, I am finally able to say &#x27;&#x27;</li>
      <li>/&gt;Later I spoke with Tammy-Jo, whose antediluvian stonewashed jeans precluded her from walking a straight line for more than three feet in any one direction.</li>
      <li>I loved this item, it&#x27;s a lot more comfortable than I expected, it stays in place and it really works</li>
      <li>Nonetheless, I did manage to administer several surveys and have collected the most prominent results for your review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Despite her professed discomfort, two layers of The Pad were remarkably effective at visually suppressing Tammy-Jo&#x27;s condition, though her aim remained unimproved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>You can still see these pads right through the yoga pant material.  </li>
      <li>I found this product a fine addition to my busy life.  </li>
      <li>Now I am confident knowing that no matter how short</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty upset with this product.</li>
      <li>but overall its better than nothing.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Cuchini!</li>
      <li>Once you figure out what the instructions really mean they work great.</li>
      <li>More importantly, Regina confided that she planned to order several cases of toe pads to use as gags on her submissive male comrades.</li>

      <li>Hoping it would be comfortable enough to wear in my workout clothes....</li>
      <li>It really doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
      <li>It really does hide the camel toe.</li>
      <li>Some of us would really like to give it a try but don&#x27;t trust now.  </li>
      <li>but this did not give me much coverage</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
      <li>Not sure what was more embarrassing a camel toe or this pad that looks like a maxi pad!  </li>
      <li>The Big Toe pads work much the same way as the Cuchinis, but like butt pads, push-up bras or men&#x27;s codpieces, enhance my sexy parts rather than hide them away in shame.</li>
      <li>I was able to maintain my role as objective observer during this process by pretending to compare and contrast lawn fertilizers while Jerry was deflowered by local law enforcement.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s just say the reaction has been extraordinary - I&#x27;m now the talk of the town, and my romantic life has exploded!</li>
      <li>She says it it pretty much interchangeable, from front to back</li>
      <li>Her self-inflicted handicap seemed nearly insurmountable.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to anyone that wants to save face in public.</li>
      <li>I would much rather embrace my curves - all of them - and revel in my womanly form!</li>
      <li>After a particularly long commute home last week, with much standing in traffic on hot pavement, my camel tilted his head, lifted an eyebrow, and gave me a look that said,</li>
      <li>I would suggest this product to others who are feeling self- conscious in this area (no pun intended).</li>
      <li>Her self-inflicted handicap seemed nearly insurmountable.</li>
      <li>Too soft.</li>
      <li>first met Jerry, a victim of Stage 3 \\&quot;Man Toe,\\&quot; who enjoys gardening in lycra.</li>
      <li>She was far less effusive in her praise of the Camel Toe Pad, noting, \\&quot;This ain&#x27;t right</li>
      <li>She was far less effusive in her praise of the Camel Toe Pad, noting, \\&quot;This ain&#x27;t right</li>
      <li>&quot; Jerry was first seen loading his Prius, and later his cycling shorts, with geraniums from the Garden Center, just before being escorted from the property.</li>
      <li>I witnessed her efforts to round up shopping carts and direct them toward the general vicinity of the store&#x27;s main entrance without disabling slow-moving customers, with mixed results.</li>

<li> Few were willing to sign the waiver relieving me of liability for any mental or physical trauma incurred as a result of strapping on a Cuchini Camel Toe Pad.</li>
<li> First of all, let me start by saying my area \\&quot;down there\\&quot; is vast and deep; a veritable black hole.  </li>
<li> It won&#x27;t damage them but its not fun to go through  whole load just to find a few pieces stuck to the inside of a pair of pants or something.</li>
<li> I am a small girl with a NORMAL</li>
<li> I tried the Cuchini, and while my camel toe was completely hidden when I left the house, I later found that it was gone.  </li>
<li> and I just assumed that it had fallen out of my pant leg, but about a week later I reached down and found something falling out of my gaping vagina.  </li>
<li> The only 2 drawbacks are that I get less attention when I wear my bathing suit &amp; skinny jeans, and I had to buy a stamp sponge (I work in a mailroom and without the Cuchini blocking device</li>
<li> For alot less money you can use a panty liner and achieve the same results.  </li>
<li> Since there are no state or federal regulations prohibiting the use of ridiculously tight pants, nor any statutes requiring those who wear them to remain in their homes, it&#x27;s critical that we take a stand against this pronounced outbreak of genitalia to prevent its continued spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This was harder than you&#x27;d think.</li>
<li> I was appalled that I wasn&#x27;t able to get my money back!!!</li>
<li> I remove the tape before washing or it will come loose and stick to your other clothes.</li>
<li> then people thinking something a little different about what might be going on down thee...</li>
<li> Perhaps I can wear it with other clothing besides workout wear.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d say not worth it.</li>
<li> Not worth the money.</li>
<li> NOT worth buying.</li>
<li> but if you are wearing jeans with a thick seam, it still only helps a little.</li>
<li> my skirt or tight my pants</li>
<li> I would really like to purchase the cuchini, but find it hard to because of the immature reviews on here!!!</li>
<li> When I say randomly selected, I mean randomly selected from the tiny handful of people wearing pants tight enough to broadcast not only their gender, but also their suitability as subjects for specialized research in non-congenital human reproductive disorders.</li>
<li> How funny and how wrong!</li>
<li> I stuck a few to the bottom of his feet, and...voila!</li>
<li> an empiricist, my mission led me to the parking lot of a well-known Home Improvement Store, where total strangers were randomly selected and asked to test-drive the Cuchini Camel Toe Pad.</li>
<li> Purchased this for obvious embarrassing reasons, was wary about it upon reading the reviews.</li>
<li> , I was definitely NOT satisfied.  </li>
<li> :/</li>
<li> :-/</li>
<li> I never have to worry now about small objects being lost.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Hoping it would be comfortable enough to wear in my workout clothes....but it does shift. Perhaps I can wear it with other clothing besides workout wear.</li>
    <li> I use the cuchini whenever I wear my yoga pants out in public. It really does hide the camel toe. I would recommend it to anyone that wants to save face in public. I didn&#x27;t even feel it when I wore it. It works</li>
    <li> This will also work for chronic inflammatory hemrodial tissue.  Not for me, but for a friend.  She says it it pretty much interchangeable, from front to back</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say as seen on Keeping up with the Kardashians since Khloe found it completely uncomfortable and threw it in the garbage...Give customers true reviews!</li>
    <li> I bought these with the intention of being able to start wearing yoga&#x27;s.  I am a size six but this did not give me much coverage, I was definitely NOT satisfied.  You can still see these pads right through the yoga pant material.  Not sure what was more embarrassing a camel toe or this pad that looks like a maxi pad!  I HATED it! so i ran to the bathroom and just took it off and pulled my shirt as low as I could just so I could continue my workout until I got done.  NOT worth buying.</li>
    <li> I thought this product was genius, until I tried it out...the material is hard and not flexible at all!  The liner is so thick that i felt like I had put a mat in my swimsuit. It also shows through the bathing suit material. This product needs improvement!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of the &amp;#34;camel toe&amp;#34; ever since I heard the concept uttered by the Pride of Baltimore, filmmaker John Waters.  The Cuchini ideally should be reversible; the obverse side featuring tell-tale ridges that simulate the delectable camel toe issue that entered into the fashion vernacular with the appearance of pedal-pushers and capris and the bikini back in the 1950s; the decade that has had a formative influence on the cinema aesthetic of one, John Waters.  Cuchini should enlist his aid as a celebrity spokesperson (an interesting concept, that) for this whimsical product.  Taking a cue from the genius that marketed &amp;#34;Lee Press-On Nails,&amp;#34; why not &amp;#34;Crotchini Press On Camel Toes&amp;#34;?</li>
    <li> For alot less money you can use a panty liner and achieve the same results.  Would not recommend you spend the money on this item.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product but if you are in a pinch you can use a banana peel. Or even a piece of pita bread works.</li>
    <li> This product is useless, its uncomfortable and it doesn&#x27;t do the job, I saw it on the Kardashians show, but it didn&#x27;t have the same effect</li>
    <li> I bought it for my daughter.  She really liked it and it appeared to do the trick.  She is able to wear her clothes with confidence now.  I would suggest this product to others who are feeling self- conscious in this area (no pun intended).</li>
    <li> Cuchini definitely fixes the one problem of the line but you still have to worry about the Cuchini lines and then people thinking something a little different about what might be going on down thee... :/ but overall its better than nothing.</li>
    <li> Too soft. They don&#x27;t really do anything. I just ended up throwing them away. I&#x27;d say not worth it. Sorry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m thinking my punani is malformed after using this. Doesn&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it works if you have an actual camel toe in your pants? If it has dromedary/bactrian-repelling properties, I would like to hear about that as I&#x27;ve had some unfortunate experiences in Tunisia.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for obvious embarrassing reasons, was wary about it upon reading the reviews. However, I am very happy I purchased it! I feel comfortable in my leggings now and am very pleased. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I HAD SEEN THIS ON ONE OF THE TV SHOWS AND DECIDED TO TRY IT.  I GOT WHAT I ORDERED, BUT IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK LIKE I THOUGHT IT WOULD.</li>
    <li> You may be asking yourself, \\&quot;Steve, you appear to be of the male persuasion, where do you get off reviewing the Cuchini Camel Toe Pad, a product obviously designed for women?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s not split hairs. Camel Toe, aka Moose Knuckle, is no laughing matter. It is an assault on our dignity and our children&#x27;s future. Since there are no state or federal regulations prohibiting the use of ridiculously tight pants, nor any statutes requiring those who wear them to remain in their homes, it&#x27;s critical that we take a stand against this pronounced outbreak of genitalia to prevent its continued spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an empiricist, my mission led me to the parking lot of a well-known Home Improvement Store, where total strangers were randomly selected and asked to test-drive the Cuchini Camel Toe Pad. This was harder than you&#x27;d think. When I say randomly selected, I mean randomly selected from the tiny handful of people wearing pants tight enough to broadcast not only their gender, but also their suitability as subjects for specialized research in non-congenital human reproductive disorders. Few were willing to sign the waiver relieving me of liability for any mental or physical trauma incurred as a result of strapping on a Cuchini Camel Toe Pad. Nonetheless, I did manage to administer several surveys and have collected the most prominent results for your review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first met Jerry, a victim of Stage 3 \\&quot;Man Toe,\\&quot; who enjoys gardening in lycra. \\&quot;This Camel Toe Pad is the greatest invention of all time,\\&quot; he moaned. \\&quot;Its silky embrace is indescribable.\\&quot; Jerry was first seen loading his Prius, and later his cycling shorts, with geraniums from the Garden Center, just before being escorted from the property. To his credit, he continued to profess his undying love for the Toe Pad throughout the entirety of his protracted removal from store premises by a surprisingly large number of security personnel. I was able to maintain my role as objective observer during this process by pretending to compare and contrast lawn fertilizers while Jerry was deflowered by local law enforcement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later I spoke with Tammy-Jo, whose antediluvian stonewashed jeans precluded her from walking a straight line for more than three feet in any one direction. Her self-inflicted handicap seemed nearly insurmountable. I witnessed her efforts to round up shopping carts and direct them toward the general vicinity of the store&#x27;s main entrance without disabling slow-moving customers, with mixed results. She was far less effusive in her praise of the Camel Toe Pad, noting, \\&quot;This ain&#x27;t right, it&#x27;s all up in my grill.\\&quot; Despite her professed discomfort, two layers of The Pad were remarkably effective at visually suppressing Tammy-Jo&#x27;s condition, though her aim remained unimproved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, there was Regina, a self-described Quality Control Manager. Regina made it known straight away that she \\&quot;runs a tight ship,\\&quot; a claim supported by the apparent tensile strength of her yoga pants, which were impressively stretched beyond the limits of their structural integrity. Judging from the contents of her shopping cart, Regina seemed to be embarking on a career as a home security installation specialist. \\&quot;Give me a break,\\&quot; she spat, \\&quot;We&#x27;ve had to put up with ludicrous bulges from you guys for decades. Let us know when you&#x27;re done playing Lance Armstrong.\\&quot; I considered giving her Jerry&#x27;s phone number, but decided that it would be unprofessional to do so after remembering that I&#x27;d deleted his profile from my phone when the cops showed up. More importantly, Regina confided that she planned to order several cases of toe pads to use as gags on her submissive male comrades. I don&#x27;t think Jerry rolls like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it, three revealing outcomes for the Cuchini Camel Toe Pad, a product which promises to unite us by hiding our divisions.ocess by pretending to compare and contrast lawn fertilizers while Jerry was deflowered by local law enforcement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later I spoke with Tammy-Jo, whose antediluvian stonewashed jeans precluded her from walking a straight line for more than three feet in any one direction.

I don&#x27;t think Jerry rolls like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it, three revealing outcomes for the Cuchini Camel Toe Pad, a product which promises to unite us by hiding our divisions.review&amp;#34; something that will spare us from the disgusting bulges that you loathsome middle-aged men are wont to showcase as you cavort in your nauseating lycra outfits.&lt;br /&gt;(Note: Regina later confided that she&#x27;d ordered two cases of toe pads, and intended to use them as gags for her subservient male friends)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subject 3, Jerry, age 48&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Look, I know you said I wasn&#x27;t a good fit for your survey, but I have to tell you that this Toe Pad is the greatest invention of all time. I would compare its silky embrace to that of a cored melon. I don&#x27;t know how it looks and I don&#x27;t care, but it sure makes gardening a whole lot more enjoyable.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There you have it. If there&#x27;s another product that can &amp;#34;sweep it under the rug&amp;#34; (or something along those lines) like the Cuchini Camel Toe Pad, it&#x27;s probably not seen the light of day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to wear &amp; serves it purpose! Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money. Any panty liner will give you the same effect.</li>
    <li> I found this product a fine addition to my busy life.  It makes a dandy mouth guard and shoe insert as well.  &amp;#60;-- WARNING!  Not on the same day!</li>
    <li> did not meet my expentations</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It has kept me amused all morning with its easily installed humor! How funny and how wrong!</li>
    <li> Ever since I was a child I wanted to look like my doll, Barbie. Thanks to $130,000 in plastic surgery and my Cuchini Camel Toe Pad, I am finally able to say &#x27;&#x27;NO TO CRACK&#x27;&#x27; and achieve my childhood dream. THANK YOU CUCHINI, you did what my surgeon couldn&#x27;t do and completely removed that nasty camel toe crack that kept me from achieving perfection. Now I am confident knowing that no matter how short my skirt or tight my pants you won&#x27;t see any embarassing crack. THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> First of all, let me start by saying my area \\&quot;down there\\&quot; is vast and deep; a veritable black hole.  Some of my friends used to call me CHIME as my beef curtains blow in the wind- not any more!! If I install 2 Cachini pads  (the first one usually gets slimey then dissapears) I never have to worry now about small objects being lost.  The only 2 drawbacks are that I get less attention when I wear my bathing suit &amp; skinny jeans, and I had to buy a stamp sponge (I work in a mailroom and without the Cuchini blocking device I had plenty of moistiness for the stamps).</li>
    <li> This does work in hiding that embarrassing camel toe, but I wish it was thinner. You can see the outline of it with your swim suit on. Overall it gets the job done and to me it&#x27;s better to be able to see the cuchini outline rather than a camel toe!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty upset with this product. I got purchased this to wear with very short shorts that I have that tend to ride up. I am a small girl with a NORMAL you know what, and this product did NOT WORK!! It literally looked the same with or without it. :-/ Maybe this product would be better for yoga pants but I&#x27;m not about to wear a cuchini to get my workout on.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok. i don&#x27;t think it worked well for me</li>
    <li> After a particularly long commute home last week, with much standing in traffic on hot pavement, my camel tilted his head, lifted an eyebrow, and gave me a look that said, \\&quot;Do something. Please?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These camel toe pads are just the thing! I stuck a few to the bottom of his feet, and...voila! No more plaintive looks! He trotted through the streets with renewed spring in his step. Thanks, Cuchini!</li>
    <li> I loved this item, it&#x27;s a lot more comfortable than I expected, it stays in place and it really works</li>
    <li> Seriously, there is a reason there are porn sites dedicated to camel toe.  Don&#x27;t be ashamed of it, learn to use it to your advantage!  The onoy ones who are turned off by it are  yourselves.  Stop hiding your gift.</li>
    <li> It really doesn&#x27;t work very well. Its ok but if you are wearing jeans with a thick seam, it still only helps a little. I use them, but depending on the pants, it works ok sometimes.</li>
    <li> Works great until u run out of the tape wish it came with more than 2 pieces of tape, once the tape ran out it was not useable.</li>
    <li> A friend&#x27;s wife purchased the Cuchini Camel Toe Pad (Misc.) and asked him to apply it for her.  I guess he should have read the directions.  Don&#x27;t let the same thing that happened to him happen to you.  All I can tell you is that the adhesive side goes on the swimsuit - not the person.  He wanted to be a father, but now everything is sealed shut, and that sucker is never coming off.</li>
    <li> I use for a form fitting pair of jeans to avoid any embarrassment. These let you show off the right kind of curves. I used Hollywood fashion tape when the stickies ran out. I remove the tape before washing or it will come loose and stick to your other clothes. It won&#x27;t damage them but its not fun to go through  whole load just to find a few pieces stuck to the inside of a pair of pants or something.</li>
    <li> Once you figure out what the instructions really mean they work great. Still four stars, though, because the tape they come with is soooooo sticky it ruined a pair of panties. Once I used my own fashion tape all went well.</li>
    <li> I tried the Cuchini, and while my camel toe was completely hidden when I left the house, I later found that it was gone.  I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere and I just assumed that it had fallen out of my pant leg, but about a week later I reached down and found something falling out of my gaping vagina.  Well, it was the Cuchini.  I pulled that sucker out and man, the smell!!!  It smelled like a rotting catfish on a sunny Tennessee day.  Well, needless to say, I was disappointed in the product.  I tried to return it, but customer service says they can&#x27;t take it back and to just throw it away.  I was appalled that I wasn&#x27;t able to get my money back!!!</li>
    <li> I would really like to purchase the cuchini, but find it hard to because of the immature reviews on here!!! Some of us would really like to give it a try but don&#x27;t trust now.  Geez like grow up. I wish I could find more trustworthy reviews!!!!</li>
    <li> This is not an okay message to send to women and girls - that our NORMAL anatomy is something to be hidden, and worse yet, have someone making money from the idea that our bodies are shameful.</li>
    <li> Why should women conform to such socially-acceptable, waifish, prepubescent standards of body image? I would much rather embrace my curves - all of them - and revel in my womanly form! This is why I&#x27;m trading in my stash of Cuchini Camel Toe Pads for the more-enlightened Bertha&#x27;s Big Toe Pads. The Big Toe pads work much the same way as the Cuchinis, but like butt pads, push-up bras or men&#x27;s codpieces, enhance my sexy parts rather than hide them away in shame. Let&#x27;s just say the reaction has been extraordinary - I&#x27;m now the talk of the town, and my romantic life has exploded! My womanly region has never felt so womanly! Thank you, Big Toe Pads. Thank you.</li>
