    <li> this is really working on the ends of my hair.  without using it before, my ends would get frizzy by the end of the day.  now, i just have to put this in, blow dry and go and my hair does not end up frizzy...thanks ms. shelly for introducing me to this!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product at the salon where I have my hair cut.  I use several of Pureology&#x27;s products and they are spendy. This is a good product at a reasonable price.  When using the antisplit blowdry cream use only a small amount.  It will leave a film on your hair if you use too much.  Also,the product&#x27;s fragrance is suttle unless you use more than a few drops. Enjoy this hair product.</li>

    <li> This product gives your hair and smooth and soft look without being heavy. I am not a big product person but this I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
    <li> Tried a sample of this from my hair dresser, but didnt want to buy a $60 bottle. Found this one at a fraction of the price. I ordered it on a Monday and had it by Wednesday! Makes my (very thinck and long) hair smooth and soft after blowdrying.</li>
    <li> this was one of the other items I bought together to get a nice shine on my hair. It did not get shiney and kinda felt heavy.</li>

    <li> I always leave off one star because there is always room for improvement.  However - this product has done wonders for my VERY FINE hair.  Thank you Amazon and Pureology</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have been searching for a heat protectant that didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and added shine. This is perfect for my thick naturally curly hair. My hair looks and feels healthier after only 3 days.</li>
    <li> I had used this product before and I love it. Makes my hair so smooth and looks like a salon blow dry</li>
    <li> I would not buy this product again.  Didn&#x27;t seem to work at all and made my hair weighted down.  Just didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> I usually buy this from my stylist, but ran out and needed some asap. I love this product because it protects my hair from the heat of styling products without weighing down my hair. And it&#x27;s so convenient using Amazon Prime.</li>

    <li> This is one of the best products for straightening and blow-drying my hair. I have extremely frizzy curly hair that will attack people. Whether my hair is wet or dry I apply it to my hair while either straightening or blow-drying and it eliminates the frizz and helps give my hair body, without my hair looking like I&#x27;ve fried the life out of it. I now don&#x27;t feel as bad about using my flat iron every day. I can&#x27;t wait to see how it holds up with humidity come summer.</li>
    <li> Smooths grizzlies and smells great!  Love the soft feeling of my hair!</li>
    <li> Works great and I have to have fourteen more words in order to submit this so I will keep writing.</li>
    <li> I use this every day on long, fine straight hair. It reduces frizz and keeps my hair nice looking all day. It helps counteract my bang cowlicks w/o weighing my hair down.</li>
    <li> Great pre-style product!!</li>
