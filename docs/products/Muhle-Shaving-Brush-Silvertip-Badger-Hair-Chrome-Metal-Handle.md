      <li>I love this brush!  </li>
      <li>that I would want a nice brush.</li>
      <li>But man, they are NICE inanimate objects.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so nice and excellent quality, price is high but you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t lost any more since then.  </li>
      <li>The handle is weighty and nicely balanced as well as comfortable.  </li>
      <li>This is the best brush like only the Germans can do (details)!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re into the best shave experience, get this and a Gilette Flexball ProGlide razor (sorry purists, but it truly is the best a man can get)!!</li>
      <li>Great brush, don&#x27;t know if I would spend that much money again.</li>
      <li>And the stainless finish is great as well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving 5 stars because i love the way it looks (matches my R89 close comb and the stand as well).  </li>
      <li>I have really enjoyed the feel and heft of the brush.</li>
      <li>Ideally, I would have liked a larger brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very soft and dense bristles for great lathering.</li>
      <li>Suppose to be nice chrome right?</li>
      <li>Great starting razor!</li>
      <li>Original</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve used it a half dozen times and haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic brush for the money, soft, builds a rich lather and rinses clean.</li>
      <li>Was a gift to my son and has a nice heft to the handle and is definitely a quality product.  </li>
      <li>being said, it pairs nicely with my Murker long handle safety razor and the Muhle Stand (Nr. RHM SR SET).</li>
      <li>Well, since you are that smart, buy the brush!</li>
      <li>Hopefully it will last for many years to come.</li>
      <li>My understanding is that when you spend higher amounts of money, you get a quality product.</li>
      <li>The weight feels right, and the chrome polish is very stylish.&lt;br /&gt;Pair</li>
      <li>Very soft, compact head, lathers well, no break-in period required, no odor, dries quickly, does not lose any bristles from the beginning.</li>
      <li>This is my second brush and it is miles better than the more expensive I already own.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not quite as soft as others, but it works up a foamy lather quickly.</li>
      <li>Excellent product, very soft, fits well with the Muehle stand, but does not fit other brush holders very well.</li>
      <li>Heavy enough not to slip in your hand in the shower and looks great combined with the razor and stand.</li>
      <li>Nobody else wants to?</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this brush!</li>
      <li>As in, this brush will not be a brush very much farther into the future, it will be a few bristles good for tickling someone&#x27;s chin.</li>
      <li>Bristles are top quality, and the brush is extremely well made...</li>
      <li>But this thing looks pretty classy sitting on your bathroom counter.</li>
      <li>off the brush, mainly in the breaking in period.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this brush.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Definitely a high end badger hair brush.  </li>
      <li>Very soft on the face.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, very little shedding and soft yet firm.  </li>
      <li>It is truly one of those &amp;#34;Walter!&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Barbara!&amp;#34; moments that you see on old fashioned television.</li>
      <li>I mean more than one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Muehle is old school European quality at its finest.</li>
      <li>no loose bristles at all in 3 months of daily use.  </li>

<li> /&gt;Muehle is old school European quality at its finest.</li>
<li> no loose bristles at all in 3 months of daily use.  </li>
<li> Other sub $50 brushes were soft but had no backbone.  </li>
<li> Very solid construction, should last for a very long time.</li>
<li> It is well made and will last a long time.</li>
<li> I will be using this brush for a long while.</li>
<li> I believe, it&#x27;s made of the same synthetic material as the Jack Black brush, has similar dimension and feel to it.</li>
<li> The brush is really soft yet it has a stiff backbone that can stand up to the hardest of soaps.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews that mentioned initial bristle loss, but that has not been my experience.  </li>
<li> Oh, the bathroom is down the hall and to the left.</li>
<li> I spent $75 on the stand (brush and razor).</li>
<li> Although expensive, it is worth it.  </li>
<li> The only criticism is the shape of the handle: It&#x27;s not very ergonomic and it does not fit every stand.</li>
<li> (Muhle RHMSRSET), are made for each other.</li>
<li> I mean multiple.</li>
<li> I bought this brush to replace a art of shaving Gillette brush that lasted less than six months.  </li>
<li> If your thinking to getting into the old school way of shaving definitely pick this bad boy up with some Proraso Eukalyptus shave soap.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s heavy weight and chrome</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s a heavy, quality brush.</li>
<li> However, it does feel small in hand.</li>
<li> very small knot for the price.</li>
<li> A very small chin.</li>
<li> I mean, you could buy them both and see if they run longing to each other, but after all let&#x27;s not get too crazy here.</li>
<li> Plus, I knew there would be some initial startup costs that would just almost be painful.</li>
<li> You guessed wrong!</li>
<li> The chrome is already pitted and will eventually (as in soon) be worthless!   </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have purchased two of these, one for me and one as a gift. It is a high quality brush and works so much better than cheaper brushes.</li>
    <li> If you havent ever used a brush this is awesome!!</li>
    <li> Great brush, don&#x27;t know if I would spend that much money again. Hopefully it will last for many years to come.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, very soft, fits well with the Muehle stand, but does not fit other brush holders very well. I believe, it&#x27;s made of the same synthetic material as the Jack Black brush, has similar dimension and feel to it. Only the handle seems to be different.  Very soft, compact head, lathers well, no break-in period required, no odor, dries quickly, does not lose any bristles from the beginning. Very solid construction, should last for a very long time. And the stainless finish is great as well. NO stains or rust at all. The only criticism is the shape of the handle: It&#x27;s not very ergonomic and it does not fit every stand.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic brush for the money, soft, builds a rich lather and rinses clean. Heavy enough not to slip in your hand in the shower and looks great combined with the razor and stand.</li>
    <li> Excellent silver tip brush.  The brush is really soft yet it has a stiff backbone that can stand up to the hardest of soaps.  Other sub $50 brushes were soft but had no backbone.  Although expensive, it is worth it.  Has good heft with excellent workmanship.  Hairs do no fall off and it has no smell.</li>
    <li> GREAT Brush. The weight feels right, and the chrome polish is very stylish.&lt;br /&gt;Pair it with the chrome Muhle R89 razor, and their razor/brush stand and you have a hansom set that is a pleasure to use and admire. :-D</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so nice and excellent quality, price is high but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Perfect sized brush - has not lost a hair yet, and lathers nicely for both shave soap and cream! The nickel handle is wonderfully weighted and the brush is A+ handsome! This is the best brush like only the Germans can do (details)!

    <li> Was a gift to my son and has a nice heft to the handle and is definitely a quality product.  Beautifully matches the Muehle DE Razor and DE Brush (RHMSRSET) stand reviewed elsewhere.  Definitely a high end badger hair brush.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great...bought it to go along with a Muhle R89 safety razor.  Bristles are top quality, and the brush is extremely well made...no loose bristles at all in 3 months of daily use.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving 5 stars because i love the way it looks (matches my R89 close comb and the stand as well).  Also works great.  Makes some noise when bumped against a shave bowl because of it&#x27;s heavy weight and chrome handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll say that my $12 Escali does the same job as this one at, literally, a fraction of the cost.  But this thing looks pretty classy sitting on your bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Matched my Muhle razor perfectly. Lathers great and hasn&#x27;t had problems with hairs shedding. If your thinking to getting into the old school way of shaving definitely pick this bad boy up with some Proraso Eukalyptus shave soap.</li>
    <li> This is my second brush and it is miles better than the more expensive I already own. It&#x27;s not quite as soft as others, but it works up a foamy lather quickly. I use it with Muehle shaving soap, which is a revelation in and of itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Muehle is old school European quality at its finest.</li>
    <li> This Muhle shaving brush is made of quality materials, is well crafted, and is of good weight. However, it does feel small in hand. After additional research post purchase, I found that Muhle describes it as &amp;#34;coupe&amp;#34;.  Ideally, I would have liked a larger brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it pairs nicely with my Murker long handle safety razor and the Muhle Stand (Nr. RHM SR SET). I will be using this brush for a long while.</li>
    <li> Great shaving brush! Very soft and dense bristles for great lathering.</li>
    <li> Very soft on the face. Creates a great lather and it&#x27;s a heavy, quality brush. I&#x27;ve used it a half dozen times and haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding.</li>

    <li> Updated Review!!! As of today, 10/29/2015, I would not buy this brush again!!!! I have ONLY had it 9 months and bristles continue to fall out every time I use it! I mean more than one. I mean multiple. As in, this brush will not be a brush very much farther into the future, it will be a few bristles good for tickling someone&#x27;s chin. A very small chin. My understanding is that when you spend higher amounts of money, you get a quality product. Not so with this product! And forget the manufacturer doing anything about it! They only offer a three month warranty. Just a show of hands, anybody here want to spend over a 100 bucks and get something that doesn&#x27;t even last a year? Yes, you in the back, what&#x27;s that? Oh, the bathroom is down the hall and to the left. Nobody else wants to? Well, imagine that.   You be the judge. I went from a five star review to a one star. Oh, in case you were wondering if it is just this one brush. I spent $75 on the stand (brush and razor). Suppose to be nice chrome right? Eeeeeghhhh. You guessed wrong! The chrome is already pitted and will eventually (as in soon) be worthless!   What is up with the quality with this company??!!   Original: That is what it feels like.  This brush is wonderful. I knew that when I chose to go DE that I would want a nice brush. Plus, I knew there would be some initial startup costs that would just almost be painful. This brush, and the stand that goes with it (Muhle RHMSRSET), are made for each other. It is truly one of those &amp;#34;Walter!&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Barbara!&amp;#34; moments that you see on old fashioned television. I mean, you could buy them both and see if they run longing to each other, but after all let&#x27;s not get too crazy here. They are just inanimate objects.  But man, they are NICE inanimate objects. I have really enjoyed the feel and heft of the brush. It is course but also has a wonderful texture as you lather up and rub it in. Speaking of that, you should definitely get one. I have one and you don&#x27;t. Saw that coming didn&#x27;t you?  Well, since you are that smart, buy the brush! It is well made and will last a long time. I have lost a couple of bristles (hairs?) off the brush, mainly in the breaking in period. If there is such a thing! Haven&#x27;t lost any more since then.  Ladies, if you are looking for a gift for your guy, then get this with the stand and the Muhle R89. Great starting razor! I got mine with Persona blades to start, although I am thinking of moving up to the samurai sword ones soon. Nip and tuck.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> very small knot for the price. but it is silver tipped badge to that&#x27;s the plus for it.</li>
