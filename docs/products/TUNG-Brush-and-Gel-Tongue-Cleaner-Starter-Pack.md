<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I would strongly recommend one buy a brush with the gel, because the gel works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you use this, WARNING: do not apply a lot of pressure when using this, it will make your tongue bleed, and it hurts especially with spicy food. I learned this the hard way. Excessive pressure is not required to scrape off just that white layer on the tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a few months now after I brush my teeth, I&#x27;d still have a nasty feeling in my mouth. Even listerine wouldn&#x27;t fix it. Later I find out it was my tongue that was causing the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this at a friends house and was confused as to what it was. When I found out, I was very skeptical, how is a circle toothbrush any different from a regular one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it works. The first stroke you make, you can feel it removing all that nasty white cloudy stuff that plastic tongue scrapers can&#x27;t even dream of removing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a tongue scraper, don&#x27;t waste your money on a plastic one, get something that  works. This tongue brush works very well!&lt;br /&gt;Also very good if you have a kissing partner, they will enjoy the fresher breath much more :)</li>
    <li> This works very well and I have tried different products.  The gel tastes good and the scraper is comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Nothing special. No different than toothpaste, and the brush is ok but be gentle when you use it or you&#x27;re going to have one sore tongue!!!</li>
    <li> If you are trying to decide to purchase this or another tongue cleaner (i.e. Orabrush), get the TUNG. I purchased the Orabrush after Wal-Mart stopped carrying the TUNG, the bristles on the Orabrush are you soft too clean. TUNG cleans much better without scraping off your taste buds, unless you brush too hard.  And it doesn&#x27;t take much pressure to get your tongue clean. The gel is pretty good as well, not minty. It usually takes me 2-3 swipes with the TUNG/Gel combo to clean my whole tongue.</li>
    <li> Excellent! There is a real difference between using this and just brushing your tongue with your toothbrush!</li>
    <li> Very effective. My tongue feels quite nice after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
    <li> Okay, while I always read almost every review, I NEVER take the time to write one......But for this product, I finally had to - so I hope you listen to what I tell you here, because this stuff has been life changing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have suffered from chronic bad breath for the last several years, and I have tried literally EVERYTHING available on the market to help get rid of it......Dr. Katz&#x27;s TheraBreath, Breath Appeal, different tongue sprays and scrapers, etc. - none of it seemed to work very well, if at all. Then I found the Breath Rx toothpaste and mouth rinse, which really did seem to help significantly - but something was still missing in terms of really doing the trick. Then I came across the Tung Brush and gel, and it truly changed my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the brush combined with the gel is so incredibly effective at getting all of the nasty gunk off of your tongue and the roof of your mouth (especially if part of your problem comes from post nasal drip). I can&#x27;t even begin to describe how much disgusting stuff this brush removes that other tongue scrapers don&#x27;t even come close to touching. It&#x27;s quite amazing, actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to be one of those people who claim that they no longer have morning breath, but as long as I use the brush and gel twice a day (and sometimes once in the middle of the day) my bad breath is significantly improved. Like by leaps and bounds. I will say that I&#x27;m certain that using the Breath Rx rinse afterwards and in between definitely contributes a lot to the solution - I think it&#x27;s both products together that do the trick for me. But if you suffer from bad breath and tend to get lots of that nasty gunk built up on the back of your tongue, this brush will change your life. Buy it - it&#x27;s TOTALLY worth the small price!!!</li>
    <li> The brush really does a great job of cleaning the tongue.&lt;br /&gt;The gel also keeps the breath fresh and taste good too!</li>
    <li> Great buy fresh breath will buy again</li>
    <li> Product arrived the next day I order it, that was awesome. Packaging was great. Love this so much, it worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tongue gel gets rids off the stuff in the tongue perfect, the scum just come off when you brush your tongue. I find the brush too harsh on my tongue it bled.. so opted on using a different brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel has a great consistency, no nasty taste and smell.  It works like a toothpaste on the tongue and it cleans my tongue perfectly and removes nasty tastes and smell on the tongue. I use this after I brush my teeth in the morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, will continue using this.</li>
    <li> Love this better than the foam (forgot the brand) I was using before. It keeps my tongue very clean. No bad Breath.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I read some of the reviews before buying this and saw some people thought the brush was hard and made their tongue bleed.  The brush felt soft to my fingers and to my tongue.  I however made the mistake of pressing a bit hard the first few times.  Although I didn&#x27;t feel like I was being aggressive, my tongue started to bleed.  Conclusion, start off light and soft. You don&#x27;t need to press hard to get the product to work.  I have been using it for a little over week now and it I see improvements.  I start with using a spoon to clear off some of the crud on my tongue. Then apply some minty gel to the brush and lightly (and slowly) start at the back of the tongue and pull forward (as directions state).</li>
    <li> Second time for me to buy this product and love the way it cleans my tongue and freshens my breath.  It will make you tongue bleed at first if u not used to it, but it&#x27;s not gonna hurt you.</li>
    <li> I always buy this stuff. Greatest stuff on Earth. Works great after a hard core night of drinking and eating terrible foods.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this from my local rite aid I believe but it only came with the sample gel. I think my rite aid no longer carries it so I was so happy to find this on Amazon. And it came with a lovely size gel. I always preferred using the tung gel on my tongue rather than toothpaste. Happy camper.</li>
    <li> This product works well at ridding the mouth of that \\&quot;sour\\&quot; taste when nothing else seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a round, stiff bristled brush and some mild mint tasting gel. The first week I was really pleased but after a while I noticed my tongue was raw and sore. So while I would prefer to use it more frequently, I&#x27;ve found that about once a week is all my tongue can take.</li>
    <li> Love both of these. Helps get that icky taste off your tongue and my breath is so much better. Brush is awesome-I don&#x27;t gag on it.</li>
    <li> Boyfriend said my breath has been funky lately, although I brush 2-3 times a day, floss and see a dentist regularly. As soon as I got this, he said it is gone. It is true what they say, that most funk comes from the tongue. Now I don&#x27;t need to be paranoid.</li>
    <li> DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found &amp; bought Tung tongue Brush cleaner &amp; Tung gel at Rite Aid today, not online / from Amazon. (if any1 doubts I bought them, I&#x27;ll be happy to post the receipt as proof. Just let me know.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After ONLY 1 cleaning, I was AMAZED how much a \\&quot;powered\\&quot; tongue scraper &amp; electric toothbrush miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I JUST had my teeth cleaned (found no cavities).&lt;br /&gt;So, I was surprised &amp; shocked how much yucky &amp; gross plaque was still on my tongue. This was in spite of using the \\&quot;powered\\&quot; tongue scraper that&#x27;s included in my WaterPik Water Flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MANUAL Tung brush &amp; Tung Gel run circles around the WaterPik \\&quot;powered\\&quot; tongue scraper, leaving it in the dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my Philips Sonicare electric \\&quot;powered\\&quot; toothbrush doesn&#x27;t come close to the cleaning my tongue gets from the MANUAL Tung tongue brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy I took a chance, before reading any reviews, &amp; bought these products on a whim. BEST WHIM PURCHASE EVER!!!!</li>
    <li> Loved it so much that I instantly threw away my orabrush! I also love the fact it comes with a gel, orabrush will charge you, and it&#x27;s not gel, but foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is coming from someone who uses orabrush for about 5 years (or when it first came out)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe me when it says that there&#x27;s little to no gag. I mean if i go a little bit lower, I&#x27;ll gag, but it isn&#x27;t a bad gag. I know, it&#x27;s confusing, but with the orabrush, If i try to go the same as with TUNG, I instantly gag and my chest HURTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what I mean with the bad gag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the gel is amazing, it tastes good, and it works! And it comes with no horrible after-taste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this cleaner, as soon as possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could give a better review. haha</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time brushing your tongue with a toothbrush, and don&#x27;t waste your money on those wimpy tongue brushes. Tung is the best thing around!  Paired with their minty zinc gel, you&#x27;ll be seriously clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. You have to have it.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST tongue cleaner ever! Especially for person who loves Coffee with Milk and Sugar.&lt;br /&gt;The build up from the milk and sugar on my tongue is gross. Stinks too. However I love my coffee that way.&lt;br /&gt;I have used so many tongue cleaners unsuccessfully. I scrapped every morning and night. My tongue was never clean.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS NOW, after using TUNG. Now my breath is fresh. The build up is all gone. My tongue is a pretty pink again!&lt;br /&gt;The TUNG is great for brushing the roof, side and gums of your mouth as well. I even brush my teeth with it! The GEL, I honestly don&#x27;t really like or care for the GEL but the toothbrush is amazing.</li>
    <li> Better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I have had tongue brushes before in the past but this is the best one.  Tried to find it locally but no one carried it.</li>
    <li> I love the concept of a tongue brush. I always used to brush my tongue quickly with my toothbrush - but I feel as though this works better. I like the sweet mint flavor of the gel.</li>
    <li> waste of money :/ makes the your tongue whiter at the end of the day</li>
    <li> Even at my most cautious I was left with various bleeding spots around my tongue. More so, in an effort to avoid further bleeding one doesn&#x27;t apply the pressure necessary to reach the indentation that runs the midline of your tongue. The gel on the other hand is quite refreshing, and am leaving two stats if just for that.</li>
    <li> Nothing spectacular really. It works, but it does make you gag.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple tongue brushes, which I like more than scrapers as they work better and are more gentle (usually). TUNG is my favorite and after trying the gel I love that too! Your mouth feels really clean afterward. You don&#x27;t&#x27; absolutely NEED the gel, you&#x27;ll get by just fine without it., but if you can swing it go ahead!&lt;br /&gt;As for the brush, it works better than any other brand. The only caution I have for you is to FOLLOW DIRECTIONS, especially in the beginning. If you brush too long/hard when you&#x27;re starting out your tongue will bleed, and you&#x27;ll have no one to blame but yourself.</li>
    <li> The brush is great, but the gel leaves a bad taste on your tongue. In addition, I&#x27;ve also noticed that using the gel doesn&#x27;t really matter, it&#x27;s the mechanical action of the brush that matters.</li>
    <li> This works incredibly well.  If you suffer from bad breath this will eliminate most cases. I use it in conjunction with a tongue scraper and mouth wash,  my girlfriend is always amazed how fresh my breath is in the morning.  Use morning and night and you will get great results. This assumes of course you floss twice a day and brush your teeth twice a day!!</li>
    <li> I have tried other products for long lasting fresh breath over the years and this one is by far the BEST!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue buying the Tung Gel.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  My mouth is clean and fresh!  So glad I tried it!!!  I read reviews of people&#x27;s tongues getting sore, well that&#x27;s probably because they pressed too hard!!  Duh!</li>
    <li> This brush did not work well and on top of that, it made my tongue bleed! Then continued to hurt for 3 days. I will be sticking with my copper scraper.</li>
    <li> the brush is a little tough but its effective, the gel is a bit too bland for my taste. I like the minty fresh biting my tongue.</li>
    <li> Terrible. You&#x27;re just as well off using a toothbrush if you buy this, and the gel just seems like any old light toothpaste. Yes, the round shape helps a little, but that&#x27;s all it really is: a bristled brush. Dr tungs metal tongue scraper is what you really want if you&#x27;re shopping for this type of thing and actually going through reviews. It&#x27;s cheap and I&#x27;ve yet to find anything better.</li>
    <li> I love having this, and it does a great job at keeping my tongue clean. The gel has a kinda weird taste, but you get used to it. I usually just mouthwash afterwards. But! Be careful, don&#x27;t brush your tongue with this, just lightly run the brush around enough to get the gel all over it. I cut my tongue a bit my first time using it...</li>
    <li> The tongue cleaner did not work for me.  I also didn&#x27;t like using a gel on my tongue containing Methylparaben. I found that the Therabreath tongue cleaner worked way better.</li>
    <li> This is the best purchase that I&#x27;ve made in a while.  I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve waited to buy something for my breath/tongue.  Don&#x27;t hesitate, buy it, it works!</li>
    <li> It really does the job well but I wish it came with a hard plastic case to store the brush.</li>
    <li> Hurt my tongue and made it sore after using it gently.</li>
    <li> Works great...Use it gently, it cleans beautifully with a very light touch...most of us would brush with the same intensity as one would their teeth. Teeth are hard...tongues are not...be gentle and you&#x27;re breath will be amazing...</li>
    <li> This was my first TUNG product and it does such a great job, I went out and bought the toothbrush, the floss and the toothbrush sanitizer covers. It keeps your tongue clean without making you gag or vomit and it is painless. My mouth has never been cleaner. I would highly recommend using this product and all the dr Tung&#x27;s products: ionic toothbrush, floss, toothbrush sanitizers,etc in addition to this great tongue cleaner.</li>
    <li> For the past year or so, I&#x27;ve been struggling with issues of bad breath. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, I brush my teeth after every meal, floss, rinse with mouthwash 2x daily, whiten my teeth, and visit my dentist regularly.... But something has just been &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;. I noticed my tounge was getting slightly discolored, but brushing over my tounge with my toothbrush seemed to do nothing. I stumbled across this product from amazon recommendations, read some of the reviews and decided maybe I should give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product, which arrived only promptly, and packaged well. After brushing my teeth right befor bed I decided to give this product a go. You start from the back of your tounge and work your way to the front with the round brush... I could literally see all that build up coming off my tounge. After all was said and done.. My mouth feels brand new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m writing this review 2 hours after I used this product, and my mouth still feels fresh and clean. My only regret is not buying this product sooner! If only I could post before and after pictures everyone would be sold in a heartbeat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: this product is made in America!</li>
    <li> Every time I brush my teeth I always have a thick white foam that I can&#x27;t get rid of so I ordered this product. I&#x27;m so glad I did. Not only was my tongue clean it also freshened my breath without having to use mouthwash. Great product</li>
    <li> It helps me clean the harder to reach places on my tongue. It shipped quicker than expected and it was packaged very well. It was at a really good price point for me as well.</li>
    <li> Took a little longer to arrive but MUCH better then the square tongue brush you find in the store and the GEL well worth the extra buy!</li>
    <li> This is an AWESOME tongue brush, and so far, it&#x27;s definitely my favorite, number 1 go-to tongue cleanser!! Bristles are soft on the tongue but do an excellent job of cleaning my tongue. The cleanser is great, as well. Love the fresh minty taste, and not as overwhelmingly strong as some mint toothpastes. This is a staple for my everyday mouth cleansing routine!!!!</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, I was pleased.  The gel really tastes and feels great on the tongue and you&#x27;re left with a really clean feeling.  However, the second, and especially the third time using it caused some pain.  The bristles on the brush are way to stiff/hard...before buying this I used to just brush my tongue with my toothbrush and it never hurt.  Hopefully this will ease as I use it more...hopefully.</li>
    <li> cleanse the tongue well</li>
    <li> Seriously. After using the Tung brush and the gel, I am mortified by how nasty that slop looks when I spit into the sink. It&#x27;s like this gross yellow green mucus and that was on my tongue. NASTY! lol I would compare it to after eating a pack of skittles, that thick mucuousy feeling in the back of your throat and when you spit, it&#x27;s like a glob of ick. That sort of viscosity is what this product removes from my tongue, GROSS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, I&#x27;ve noticed my breath doesn&#x27;t seem to, oddly, have any smell. It&#x27;s the weirdest thing. I&#x27;ve also noticed morning breath seems to be a thing of the past. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and think I might stick them in as a stocking stuffer for my friends and family for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I like tis more than the orabrush. All its missing is a tongue scraper.</li>
    <li> The first couple of times I brushed my tongue as light as a feather and my mouth was full of blood. Once my tongue got used to it, I can honestly say it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped. I can still see the white bacteria looking stuff on my tongue. The best part about it is the gel that makes your breath fresh</li>
    <li> I am a longtime sufferer of &amp;#34;white tongue&amp;#34;, something that makes me rather self-conscious. Before I got the tung brush/gel, I had been using the Ora brush, and while that helped a bit, the problem was still very much there. I just got the Tung brush and gel today, and I have to say that after using it just once, I see more results than the several months that I had been using the orabrush. Plus the shape of the handle really lets me reach the back of my tongue without gagging, which is nice. I will admit that this did cause my tongue to bleed a little bit, but the packaging says that&#x27;s normal and should go away after a while. I&#x27;m only giving it four stars right now since I&#x27;ve only used it once and have yet to see how it works long term, but right now I&#x27;m hopeful.</li>
    <li> I could feel and smell an immediate difference after using this. I havent been told my breath stinks but I am always paranoid it may. After using this now when I breathe out all I smell is yummy toothpaste and I can tell not only does my breath not stink it smells great.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews first. The negatives reviews sound ignorant, so I ordered anyway.&lt;br /&gt;This is the BEST tongue cleaner ever! Especially for person who loves Coffee with Milk and Sugar.&lt;br /&gt;The build up from the milk and sugar on my tongue is gross. Stinks too. However I love my coffee that way.&lt;br /&gt;I have used so many tongue cleaners unsuccessfully. I scrapped every morning and night. My tongue was never clean.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS NOW, after using TUNG for 4 days. Now my breath is fresh. The build up is all gone. My tongue is a pretty pink again!&lt;br /&gt;The TUNG is great for brushing the roof, side and gums of your mouth as well. I even brush my teeth with it! The GEL is so refreshing! Better then yucky tooth paste! It rinses off so well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy I bought two tubes of the gel. Now I want a case of the TUNG BRUSH and GEL!&lt;br /&gt;Thank-you for reading!&lt;br /&gt;BTW: This makes a great gift for the person who has everything! LOL&lt;br /&gt;Brigitte in Tulsa, OK with Sweet Breath!</li>
    <li> I like the shape of the tongue clean its wide and cleans my mouth well i like it a lot better than the tongue scrapper i usually use.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> great for brushing around in your mouth. not effective as a tongue scraper. i use the Dr. Tung&#x27;s metal tongue scraper to actually keep my tongue clean. this brush is nice for brushing the roof of my mouth and my tongue after i&#x27;ve cleaned it with the scraper.</li>
    <li> brush is too sharp for tongue. the gel is a nice flavor and seems to work for bad breath, but i don&#x27;t find myself using it. i just use a table spoon for a tongue scraper, works great.</li>
    <li> I, for whatever reason, have horrible breath. Always have. My mother had problems with her breath as well, so I think its genetic. My brother dosen&#x27;t have bad breath. I, THANK THE GOOD LORD GOD, have found &amp;#34;Tung Gel&amp;#34; and a tongue brush, plus a tongue scraper for good measure works WONDERS. It WORKS SO WELL that it almost freaks me out to receive positive reactions when talking to people. They get really close and continue conversations without any sign that my breath is bad. I have even eaten a meal and been able to keep talking for a little while before I need to scrape and tongue brush again. If you have the struggles I have though, please do try &amp;#34;Tung Brush and Gel&amp;#34;. Best to you all.</li>
    <li> Makes my mouth feel fresh and clean. The brush is a little harsh at first, but you get used to it. The Gel has a good minty clean taste,</li>
    <li> This stuff is perfect. I noticed the clean the very first brush. It doesn&#x27;t taste bad and it simply cures bad breath. And I mean it. I though mouthwash was the best way but actually this stuff is. Mouthwash usually works part of the way. Like some don&#x27;t even help and the ones that do help your still worried about your breath after you eat. This stuff let&#x27;s you go about your day worry free. Just try it for yourself and you will understand the difference. I&#x27;d recommend to everyone regardless of how great you take care of your dental hygiene. Everyone should be able to walk around with great clear breath. I can&#x27;t even smell my breath anymore. My mouthwash is great but this stuff just kicks its up a notch. I use this after my mouthwash cus it works way better than the mouthwash so why not get the best out of both. So brush my teeth and tongue as regular then I use my Listerine healthy white mouthwash then I follow with my tongue paste on the tongue brush. The tongue brush is amazing its way better than a regular toothbrush. Like I said just try these yourself.</li>
    <li> The gel is somewhat weak.</li>
    <li> After using this only once I can already see, and feel, a dramatic difference. My tongue simply looks and feels cleaner.</li>
    <li> Tung brush&amp;gel is a perfect thing to keep tung clean and fresh,i would advise to buy it to everyone.thank you.</li>
    <li> I have always had a hard time with bad breath and &amp;#34;white/grey tongue&amp;#34;. However, this TUNG kit takes care of all that and makes my tongue pink again! I have used scrapers and I brush my tongue, but the TUNG brush and gel have been the only things that can make my tongue pink again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning, however: for the first day or two you use it (or for the first two or three uses) your tongue will bleed a little. It does mention this on the bottle but I thought if I was really REALLY gentle it wouldn&#x27;t happen. It does, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt very much and it gets your tongue clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love this stuff and will order more when I run out!</li>
    <li> In that moment this is very important. I like it</li>
    <li> This is the most helpful and wonderful product since the beginning of my breath problem. I talk a lot so these items make me less conscious of speaking at times of close range.</li>
